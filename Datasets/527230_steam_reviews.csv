All of your supplies must be ready for the next part of the quest line. There is no general thought (oh i should stock up on health and poison curing herbs); you need the specific items are the specific time.

For instance, at one point you will need fight some elemental enemies. You have the opportunity to swap gear and weapons before you enter, but if you've never been to the area before YOU WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT GEAR TO USE. You can not switch armor mid fight, switching weapons wastes a turn. If you walk into the Shock Elemental Guys battle with 0 shock protection and a character with a shock weapon (like i did) then you are screwed. You will take 9000 damage.  Better yet, you will get hit with a ""shock effect"". While active this effect prevents you from 100% your attack roll, which essentially means you will never land your attack since the enemies dodge attacks like muhammed ali.

The fact the dev's say ""you will likely not win on your first try"" is their half ass lazy excuse for poor game design. You must memorize the game, memorize each encounter, know what every single enemy attack is and when they are likely to use it. Otherwise you will waste resources and that snowballs into an inevitable loss.

Nothing count in your runs just RNG...Team comp, experience or perfect routing, nothing matter because if RNG not help you during shop refreshes, loots, critical hits and dice rolls you will loose during midgame...ALWAYS
When I played the game on medium difficulty I thought this is a fun and chill game. But as for me, who like challenging and always try games on hardest diff where the real fun need to came, I expect a much more creativity from a game developer rather then time limit, permadeath and a lot of RNG... 
Sadly on master difficulty the game turns into an RNG rage game and you can only trust in dice rolls, so it's enough.

Not too grindy, no innovation skill needed, somewhat critical thinking involved, not lore intensive nor theory-crafting intensive, and not time consuming from start to finish. Same goes obtaining achievements. Achievements were a great time to explore the edges of what this game has to offer. Great game to play with friend(s) and the art is pleasant from friendly to gore-like pixels. Downsides would be camera mobility being user control limited which interfere with gameplay from clicking, snapping back, and motion sickness (mimic bouncing, fighting on boat, etc.). Also white screen illuminating to max whenever an event completion takes place (very disturbing in dark environment) was annoying. Lastly, random disconnects were a hassle and I had an incident where my file was no longer visible to play due to corruption so my friend and I ended up having to play all over again.

I would still recommend it for others to try out especially if you're a beginner in turn base combat type of games. Make sure to look into the horizon when fighting on a boat while waiting for your friend's turn or enemy's turn, reminder to yourself and your friend(s) to look down/away or close your eyes whenever the white light starts to blare at your screen upon completing an event, and hang in there when fighting mimics!

The game tries to pose itself as difficult to make it feel more adventurous but after a bit of playtime you realize it's because the devs didn't care to adjust scaling or anything at all, really. Campaigns are rushed, the game doesn't show you how much debuffs penalize stats, the end-game meta always ends up saving up teleport scrolls, buying out all shops and prolonging the game as much as you can since the final boss of any of the campaigns are only beatable if either you're incredibly lucky at the same level or grind out way past the recommended turn count until you can eventually fight the boss on fair terms. Certain items have mislabelled properties, random mobs often end up stronger than the final boss, the ""lore"" store unlocks every best item in every category and the story's blandness tries to deflect how uninteresting it is by filling it with dry humorless jokes. 

Anyways, it's pretty fun the first couple times around and it serves as practice for cooperation and communication with a friend than actually having fun past a point. Flat 6/10, I feel like it'd be worth it for like 10 bucks. Not 20.

BUT

Please, devs, if you're reading this, can you address the increasingly widespread 'unable to proceed past the Understood screen' bug that literally prevents people from playing the game they paid money for? None of the fixes in that 2 year old guide work for people now, and a game of this calibre (that is still being sold...) deserves an up-to-date solution.

I have the Mac version, and it used to work *perfectly*; smooth as butter, no issues at all. And now I literally can't even get to the main menu. I have tried every possible solution suggested by the darkest depths of Reddit, and never can I bypass that infuRIATING PURPLE BUTTON. So, in order actually play FTK, I have to use Crossover to simulate a Windows environment, rather than via the OS my copy was optimised for. :') 

I understand that the devs are prioritising FTK 2 now, but this game is barely 6 years old and has a large and active playerbase. I just think discontinuing support for FTK is kinda lame IMO, especially as it is literally a game-breaking issue. It doesn't even look like the devs have visited the Technical Support forum since 2021....

Please patch it, or suggest another workaround, because this game is like crack to me and I would like to play it the way it was intended to be played on a Mac. <3",1704931918,1704931918,False,14,1,0.639372587203979492,0,True,False,False

Game uses ""Epic Online Services"" malware!  Cannot recommend!

A slow paced, extremely relaxing game. It can be as casual, or as punishing as you like. Multiple different campaigns, with multiple different classes. You can only take 3 characters with you, so it has tons of replayability. It has quite a bit of depth in strategy, with status effects, armor, and magic barriers ontop of health. There are tons of enemy archetypes as well as some boss battles. 

You move across a map in hex grid movements. Air travel, ship travel, different terrain types. 

It can be played by up to 3 player coop, if youre into that sort of thing.

A great addition for fans of Turn Based games

---UPDATE---
Ive had this game for years, and have come back to it multiple times, and always end up quitting in frustration.. Like XCom, it relies heavily on hit chances, and this wouldnt be all that bad, it it werent for some of the masochistic designs.. Poison for example, lasts until you use a specific herb. This herb, like any other goods/service, is constantly increasing in price. Its ALWAYS expensive, no matter how far along you get.  Youre ALWAYS fighting enemies at, or above your level, and are playing a carrot on a stick, thats always stacked against you. It went from being cute and relaxing, to frustrating, and tedious. I havent even beaten the BASE campaign, to even bother with any additional ones.. Yet, Ive got nearly half of the Lore books unlocked!

Your damage and abilities are SOLELY dependant upon which weapon you have equipped, and for some, you may not find an update for many levels.. My most recent attempt, my Lumberjack never got a new weapon, and I gave up at lvl 5...

So, no... I would NOT recommend the game. i hate when I feel unable to complete a game, and this is one of a few that Ive quit out of frustrating design. I never beat Darkest Dungeon either, despite really liking that one.",1629497321,1703534890,False,0,0,0.256792575120925903,0,True,False,False

I played probably 12 hours straight and being this is a roguelike RPG, I was forced to start over four times. The last time my party arduously achieved level 6 and were horrendously wiped out in an ambush consisting of gank level characters. Emitting a sigh of disgust (and defeat) I hit the uninstall button. 

Starting life as a Kickstarter project, this game exudes attention to detail and an obvious love from its creators. The artstyle is reminiscent of something that looks like the lovechild of Minecraft and a Pixar animated film. The characters reminded me of old Fisher-Price figures stolen from a child's playset. Seeing these characters getting blown to pieces by blunderbusses or perforated with arrows due to the game's rag doll physics were comical. Being from a country that embellishes television comedies with laugh tracks, I never had much appreciation for the genre, but this game made me laugh numerous times. Behind the scenes, however, we have a genuine dungeon crawler with campaigns of various degrees of difficulty. The quests were compelling and reminded me of the tabletop DnD sessions I enjoyed in my youth.  

I feel almost hoodwinked with how easy it was to lose hours to this game and ultimately realize it defeated me. I like difficult games, but the deaths in this game just didn't feel fair. Barely surviving a dungeon and going back to town to heal up, and then getting ambushed by a trio of cursed witches or werebears at full health just felt contrived. (To its testament as a roguelike, one cannot save in the game.) Admittedly, my lack of prowess with this game (and enjoyment of it) could be ascribed to how I was playing it. The designers made it to be a multi player game, and I've read the game is easier played with other people, but there are some games I just prefer to play alone.

My complain where mostly based on the arrange of things while having a turn based combat, the tanks couldn't really tank, the supports couldn't really have a decent turn and in general the roles where all diminished by the fact that doing damage was always better than anything else. Still, apparently they solved this in the second entry by having a Turn Based Grid combat and I think that was the right decision to make. Still, I don't own the second game so I don't really know, hope that in the next months I buy it and then you would be able to look at that review.

The game warns you every time that you open it up that you will most likely die, but that's part of the game. All right, I enjoy a challenge, so I'll give it a shot, but holy crap!

You play super defensively, build up your party, and then get completely decimated by a monster below your level, and you have to start all over again. After the 5th or 6th time this happens, it stops being fun.

I like the mechanics and the idea is sound, but having to start over from scratch every single time gets very old, very quickly.

It abuses of the random where every single hit may take up to 5 throw to succeed. Even moving on the map rely on rolling the dice, making every game very random and hard to plan any strategy...even at the easiest difficulty.
I finished the game a few times but only by abusing the ALT+F4 functionality allowing me to replay the previous turn (the only way). Which is absolutely necessary (even at the easiest difficulty, I repeat) to go forward in the game since a single fail of your throw is extremely punitive and may kill one of your character. When I say abuse of the ALT+F4 it means (in average) 2 to 3 times every turn, from 10 times a single turn in dungeons...

The game as a good potential but the options should allow us to play at a playable difficulty and without relying too much on luck. Not to say that a reroll functionality would be more than welcome.",1699461157,1699461157,False,1,1,0.444743931293487549,3,True,False,False

It feels like playing a board game complete with having to move the characters individually across the board. Its a small thing, i know, but after two hours it started to really annoy me. If i'm playing alone, why not just let me move them together as a group? If characters have different distances they can move, then let me move them together at the distance of the lowest character then. It's just a weird piece to manage playing alone.

I will come back to it. My initial experience has left me with a fairly mixed impression but certainly not negative. I think the solo player experience is for a very certain kind of player that might not be most people.

Overall, each scenario has it's own challenges, and creating different team setups is fun.

Also making it so that enemies can't act or you ""rush"" your own party to act before others seems to be a bit cheesy, but extremely effective. However, doing that takes away a lot of the risk and challenge.

In either case, I found myself playing multiple scenarios and multiple sessions just to unlock more things with my lore points. It made the replay ability of the game that much more interesting.

The concept? Great.
Graphics? Beautiful.
Gameplay? sticking a rolling dice in your pp hole

All of the below happened on 0 chaos journeyman difficulty with all gold going to 10-20% bonus char.
This game literally works against you 24hrs 10 days a week. The ailments/debuffs are super fucking cancer. You're against the imp that can only be hit with perfect rolls? fuck you take this aoe shock effect that lasts 2 turns that ALWAYS fails 1 die roll making it impossible to kill the imp. Damage over time like burn/poison works on turn ends and in a game where the best offense is the best defense, it just results in you taking tons of unavoidable damage if you try to outpace the enemy. You're against a 80 health enemy? fuck you take this enemy caster's buff that just added 15 resistances on top of their base 15 armor while you deal 20 damage max at that level. Losing a single turn is the equivalent of losing the entire party, that turn could've killed an enemy before they used a 5 die aoe attack to deal 70% of the middle guy's health and 20% to the other 2. That or they will just use a regular single target attack and just finish off a teammate. Enemy dice rolls are straight up rigged too, I've seen them roll more perfect dices than any other combination while my characters could all attack and either roll too low to go through their armor/resistance or they will just dodge.

If the enemy has an aoe attack and its possible for them to inflict a status effect, it's guaranteed 3 of your members will be hit with it. Scared, Fleeing, and Confused are all the same, just on separate level of cancers. Scared/fleeing is literally exactly the same, you will just run away from the fight making it a 2v3. Confused is stage 5 leukemia, you lose control of your nerves and your character does random shit including using random inventory items, fleeing, or attacking a random enemy. Holding onto a 100% hp heal? fck you suck a fart out my as s cause confused just used it. Getting hit with petrified is also pretty much game over for the fight because it turns the fight into a 2v3 for 3 TURNS. 3 TURNS!!!!! There's even a debuff called acid that destroys a piece of equipped item if you con't cure it. The chaos system is cool but it also means you are constantly being rushed to do the campaign or search for cult tiles to lower the chaos. It's honestly manageable but being pushed around constantly to do the quest instead of exploring fucking sucks.

Tanking through the hits are straight up not viable because even the tankiest characters die in 4 turns max because at least 2 enemies will target a single teammate causing them to lose 80% health in a single turn while you are chipping them away because of their high armor/resistances. Let me tell you how armor/res works, when you get hit it just gets reduced by that amount depending on physical/magical damage. There's piercing damage that goes through those defensive values but only applied on perfect rolls (all dices) on certain weapons. So you need to perfect roll every weapon or else you will slowly chip their 80+ hp down with your 5 damage attacks while the enemy constantly barrages you with debuffs/ailments/curses. This is the same game where ""84%"" dice rolls into 2/4 dices hit constantly, resulting on a block because its literally throwing a wet towel. I really hate the pierce/armor/resistance system because the weapons don't scale fast enough for enemy armor/resistance so relying on perfect rolls to deal any type of damage is extremely volatile in fights. Rolling 3/4 instead of 4/4 is the difference between dealing 2 damage and 14 damage in early/mid game.

It's simply not possible to carry enough healing AND a cure for ailments AND curses. That's 3 items alone and now multiply by 3 to supply each character with one of each. Not to mention most of your gold will go into buying every healing item, healing in towns, and buying weapon upgrades. You can get gold from quests but you will use all of them bringing chaos down so it's not even viable to do one for like 60-120 gold.",1696801362,1696828487,False,1,0,0.479245275259017944,0,True,False,False

The game, a curious concoction of strategy, adventure, and role-playing elements, beckons the player into a fantastical kingdom besieged by calamity, where the echoes of a fallen monarch reverberate through the valleys and dales.

Upon the first glimpse, one is immediately ensnared by the quaint charm of its pixel-art aesthetic, a deliberate nod to a bygone era of gaming, yet imbued with a modern finesse that is as crisp as a freshly minted sovereign. The hexagonal tapestry upon which your quest unfolds is a patchwork of peril and promise, each tile a step closer to either glory or ignominy.

The narrative, albeit a trite tale of heroism and the inexorable march towards a preordained destiny, is served with a garnish of earnestness that is almost endearing. Almost. The dialogue often teeters on the precipice of archaic verbosity, threatening to plummet into the abyss of cringe-worthy cliché. Yet, it holds fast, a testament to the game's unwavering commitment to its regal theme.

The gameplay is a gallant gallop through familiar territories of turn-based strategy, with a sprinkle of rogue-like unpredictability that keeps the player on their tender toes. The combat, a dance of dice rolls and stat juggling, is as ruthless as a winter in the royal courts, where a single misstep could spell doom for your motley crew of adventurers.

The cooperative aspect of ""For the King"" is where the game truly dons its crown of distinction. The camaraderie forged in the crucible of shared adversity as you and your companions traverse the treacherous terrain is reminiscent of a fellowship of nobles, albeit with a touch more pixelated pizzazz.

The musical score, a herald of your heroic exploits, is a melodious medley that escorts your every move with a touch of orchestral opulence. It's a sweet serenade that cushions the often harsh blows of fate meted out by the game's relentless RNG gods.

In conclusion, ""For the King"" is a whimsical waltz through a kingdom where danger and delight are but two sides of the same golden coin. Its posh veneer may veil a core of conventional gaming tropes, but the cringe-worthy earnestness with which it embraces its royal motif is a guilty pleasure that one might find hard to abdicate.",1695504154,1695504154,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

2. Co-op Gameplay: The multiplayer mode allows for seamless cooperation with friends, adding a layer of depth and camaraderie to the experience.
3. Unique Art Style: The game's visually appealing low-poly art style creates a charming and distinctive atmosphere that complements the fantasy setting.
4. Dynamic World: The procedurally generated maps and quests ensure that no two playthroughs are the same, providing a high level of replayability.
5. Deep Progression System: The leveling, equipment, and skill progression offer a satisfying sense of growth and customization for characters.

Cons:
1. Steep Learning Curve: New players might find the initial learning curve to be a bit steep, as understanding the various mechanics and strategies can take some time.
2. Randomness Factor: The procedural generation, while adding replayability, can occasionally lead to unbalanced encounters or quests.

Overview:
For The King is a delightful blend of strategy and roguelike elements that offers a fresh take on cooperative gameplay. Its engaging mechanics and charming art style create an immersive fantasy world that is as challenging as it is rewarding.

Gameplay:
The core gameplay of For The King revolves around turn-based combat and strategic decision-making. Players must navigate a procedurally generated world, complete quests, and battle a variety of foes. The inclusion of hex-based movement and positional tactics adds an extra layer of depth, requiring players to carefully plan their actions.

One standout feature is the seamless integration of both single-player and multiplayer modes. The cooperative experience shines, as players work together to overcome challenges and leverage each character's unique abilities. The game encourages communication and teamwork, making it a highly engaging experience for groups of friends.

Graphics and Sound:
For The King boasts a visually appealing low-poly art style that lends a distinctive charm to the game world. The environments are beautifully designed, and the character models are expressive, despite their simple geometry. The use of vibrant colors and dynamic lighting adds depth to the world, making exploration a visual treat.

The sound design complements the visuals perfectly. From the whimsical tunes in towns to the tense battle music, the soundtrack sets the tone for each situation. Sound effects, like the clashing of swords or the creaking of a ship, further immerse players in the world.

Story and Narrative:
While For The King doesn't prioritize an intricate narrative, it provides enough context to keep players invested in their journey. The overarching goal of vanquishing the chaos threatening the kingdom serves as a solid backdrop for the gameplay. Memorable moments arise from the unexpected twists and challenges encountered along the way.

Character development, though somewhat limited in terms of individual narratives, is driven by player choices and the progression system. As characters level up and acquire new equipment, they become more versatile, allowing for diverse strategies.

Performance and Technical Issues:
For The King runs smoothly overall, with short loading times and stable performance during gameplay. However, there were occasional instances of minor graphical glitches, such as objects clipping through terrain. These were infrequent and didn't significantly impact the experience.

Multiplayer and Community:
The multiplayer aspect of For The King shines, allowing for seamless online co-op. The game provides various options for connecting with friends, whether through Steam integration or by sharing a lobby code. The community surrounding the game is active and supportive, with forums and discussions readily available for those seeking advice or looking for others to play with.

Final Thoughts:
For The King is a standout title in the strategy and roguelike genres, offering an engaging cooperative experience with deep gameplay mechanics. While it may pose a slight learning curve for newcomers, the rewarding progression and dynamic world make it well worth the investment. With its charming art style and robust multiplayer features, For The King is a must-play for fans of tactical RPGs.

Game is designed to play in co-op with 2 other blokes but is perfectly fine playing solo too. You just control all 3 characters instead of one. 
You wander the overworld map with towns and mini encounters where every tile is unexplored and may have random event or dungeon to delve in for best loot and experience. Also 3 difficulties so you can chill on easier one and on the hardest test your skills because every move and gold piece matter.
Much fun in solo play, now just need to find those 3 mythical creatures called ''friends'' to play For The King one day.

Team comp abilities like taunts are too inconsistent to be something you can rely on. An ability that consumes my entire turn to protect my allies has like a 30% chance of doing nothing at all? And lasts one measly turn if it does work?

My tank proceeds to consume all his rare consumables ""curing"" status effects he doesn't have, my archer just sits there swapping his weapon back and forth, and the scholar whales on the magic resist enemy. While my characters are effectively stunlocked, the enemies are casually murdering my squishies.

To compensate for the artificial difficulty of all this randomness, the enemy AI acts dumb and doesn't just prioritize characters at low health or weak resistance. While this is pretty necessary to make the game playable, it just further adds to the feeling that I'm playing a slot machine.

Was looking for something me and a friend could relax and enjoy together. This seemed like it was it. It has the weighty TBC with art and animations pleasing to look at and appreciate. Me and my friend are playing a good 2ish hours and we decide to get off for the day, looking forward to resuming our progress the next day. Well... Low and behold the apparent dreaded ""DisconnectByClientTimeout"". This has to be the most frustrating issue in a fully released game i have ever encountered. You basically have to start a whole new game once you receive this error. There is no fixing it. This issue has been around since the beginning of the games development, and the developers have no interest in addressing it for some reason. 5 whole years people. 

   Went trawling around the internet for any potential solutions and i came across this gem of a comment, which if listened too at all by the developers they could potentially fix this said issue no problem instead of expecting paying customers to learn how to open ports, download VPN's and mess with modem settings(I love to have port forwarding and VPN's a part of my games special features...FUN!!!). 

Here is the gist of the comment by user ""Apocalypse_555"":  ""when you do an heartbeat (the network exchange to check if a client is still connected) on any program, you do it on TCP not UDP. Why that? Because UDP is not reliable, it's not subject to debate or anything like that, it's a fact due to the technology. UDP is fast but unreliable, TCP is slow but reliable. So none is better both are used for different things. If you can afford to lose some packages, they go on the UDP, if you cannot, they go on the TCP. So guess witch protocol to use for the heartbeat. The TCP! I learned that in 2nd year of computer engineering and that's pretty basic knowledge.""

This comment was made in 2020. Already 3 years ago. Not only that there appears to be a common pattern of developers completely ignoring this error, and directing paying customers to 3rd party solutions. Absolutely unacceptable behavior from the people that advertise the feature of an online cooperative experience. If a Developer reads this, please, for love of all that is video game developer integrity fix this error. Because as it stands i will not be playing this game and neither will others who have had to deal with this error. This is ultimately a question of ethics. I, as a consumer have no idea what goes into creating a game. But you must do the bare minimum and fix glaring issues that impact player experience. 

- DO WHATEVER IT TAKES!!!!

The premise is enjoyable, the feeling and vibe are incredible without dramatizing too much, and if you know what you are doing, it becomes exciting. However, it suffers Darkest Dungeon syndrome, and that is, not a true feeling of RNG. Good rolls will stack up and bad rolls will stack up higher. And there is always a priority to dump bad rolls your way at your weakest. Which is not random, it is weighted. However, there is one key difference that makes this game different and not hindered critically by the comparison:

If you want to enjoy the game, ALT+F4 will let you.

It's an autosave after every iteration of turn and ""expect failure"" bs, sure some people will like that but like I said above, it rubs its ugly head in the way at least for me personally. And its difficulty is redoing an hours long campaign because you got the shortest straw. That's where alt+f4 comes in. Besides multi-level dungeons, you can escape most really awful rolls, and you know they are awful because the statistics are very garbage, which I will go to into detail in a sec. Most of the time you go back to the start of the last turn to try again. And granted to be reasonable, you wont get all rolls, and that's okay. It follows a pattern of good streaks and blunders. And you won't really have too much need to, except for specific results which specifically put you in a bad spot for the run. And that's where a friend taught me a valuable lesson during co-op:

If you want to enjoy the game, ALT+F4 will let you.

Let me give that example. I decided to run through a trap on level 3 in hilbert's cellar. My best character for the agility check has a 38% chance success naked and a 68% chance with one focus point spent. I ran it seven times using it with one focus, with the results
Fail Fail Fail Fail Fail Fail Fail Success (obviously after succeeding finally I wasn't going to spend more time on it). Now, statistic speaking, each roll is independent of each other and has no effect on the other, that's what we are assuming (null hypothesis). Here are the odds of that happening:
32% First Fails
32% x 32% = 10.24% Two Fails in a row
32% x 32% x 32% = 3.2768% Three Fails in a row
32% x 32% x 32% x 32% = ~1.0486% Four Fails in a row
32% x ... (five times) = 00.3355% Five Fails in a row
32% x ... (six times) = 00.1074% Six Fails in a row
Now to fail six times and we are assuming it is fair, that's a 1 in 931 chance of happening. Now if I am subject to a 1 in 931 chance event, is that fair? If you say no, that's where I was headed (I know it is moreso negative binomial distribution and needing alpha values (to find confidence intervals) and such but let's be honest this is a steam review)

Just wanted to give everyone some background  to know what kind of game you will deal with and all of its tricks of the trade. It isn't rng, it isn't fair or truly random, it is conveniently easy and situationally aggressive for no reason, numbers irrelevant. But it isn't all that bad, I enjoy the game, it is fun and it has a lot to offer. Satisfaction and fun come from a true understanding and acceptance of how the game works. Don't take my over-analysis for cynical ranting, there's much to have here. But if you decide to go for it, don't beat yourself up, don't struggle or redo everything due to a fluke chance that has a 1 in 931 chance of happening, take in all the devs have in store, and remember:

Below will be a list of pros and cons for this game. I would really think about how much you love self punishment before you play this game. This game punishes you but just punishes you to make this game seem hard and difficult to play. 

Pros:
Combat system, It is sort of like rolling dice which to me is fun.
Itemization, Lots of fun and neat things to use and unlock in this game.
Class System.
Enviorment and Maps

Cons:
Game will punish you to just seem hard. (The fact that enemies never miss a roll and its always perfect for them is just unfair. I roll I have a 80% chance but each roll also has its own percentage which is lower then that 80% they show you. So as a player expect to miss a lot of attacks and spell cast even though the enemy is built unfair to never miss rolls. Also don't go into fights thinking you and the computer monsters are the same. They get to perfectly roll everything 99.9% of the time and will always do twice or three times more damage then you will.)

Sound (Its just not entertaining or fun to listen too. The ad video for this game makes it seem like you will get fun battle music that is engaging. You do not. False Advertising comes to mind.)

Overall Feel the game says in a warning that it is hard and challenging which it is I have beaten this game multiple times in all story modes but at the same time I am doing college level calculus to figure out what move I should do next all while the computer is just unfair. 

TLDR: If you like a even playing ground against a games system this isn't the game for you. This game is unfair and puts itself above the player when it comes to fair play.",1690931165,1690931165,False,5,0,0.499042361974716187,0,True,False,False

The game is quite fun early on. There's no complicated tutorial to bog you down, and the game is simple while giving you enough freedom to give you lots of options. Whether you play alone or with friends, you will enjoy the challenges the game provides at the various difficulties the game offers. Sometimes you may get lucky, other times you may get unlucky, but if you game over'd somewhere it was very likely avoidable with better play somewhere earlier in the run.

Unfortunately the problem is that ""playing better"" mostly comes from prior knowledge of the game outside of your character. Knowing things like when the shops refresh their stock (and also increase their prices) is very important, but the game doesn't even tell you when it happens. Knowing which enemies you're going to face beforehand is also very important. The only thing you can see about enemies is their HP and armor/resistance. You can't know what kinds of attacks they can do (and therefore which immunities to bring) without first experiencing them. Monsters also have a loot table that's basically impossible for you to figure out in a reasonable amount of time. Some enemies end up being a waste of resources to fight, and some overworld encounters are even tougher than boss battles.
Additionally, player weapons are not balanced very well and you are often reliant on randomness to find a good weapon. Weapons have a huge impact on how well runs go: some weapons unlock combos that essentially become infinites while some bad ones might make your character almost useless.

The last thing to mention is that like some other roguelikes, you are able to get unlocks. Some are fine (new character classes, different encounters), but some just make the game easier (more stats, better weapons). The game is noticeably easier if you use these unlocks, which I don't think is good design.

Overall the game is still very playable, but don't expect an RPG where the skill is in the battle strategy. It's really in knowing the secrets to make the game easy.",1689706125,1689706125,False,9,0,0.549787700176239014,1,True,False,False

This is said like the game is created with fair but honest difficulty in mind.

instead, what it should say is ""You must wait for the RNG to let you finish the game. We will cheapen the experience and sell power in the form of DLC, and there's nothing you can really do to increase your chances of winning aside from abusing a specific playstyle.""

It's a sick joke when you've played perfectly and lose because you simply didn't get the gear required to survive the upcoming enemies. You make it through 20 battles without taking any damage by playing as tactically, safely, and conservatively as possible, then the game dumps an enemy on you that requires an item to beat that it also just didn't stock in the shops.

Overall, the game has great overland exploration mechanic, sadly dragged down by EXTREMELY SHALLOW AND TEDIOUS combat and character system. Story is basically non-existent so this is more like a roguelite dungeon-crawler rather than an RPG. 

Exploration
Exploration mechanic is pretty good. The party moves around the board to complete objective. Get packed together to get better combat power, or split up and rapidly dispatch the objectives on the map. One can also expend ""focus"", which can also be used to improve the stat rolls, to move around the map faster. All of these create some interesting strategies during overland exploration. I would love this game if it's other aspects also has this depth......

Combat
Unfortunately, the combat is just general tedium. You have characters lined up and beating up each other like old JRPGs, and each character perform exactly 1 action, chosen from like 4 options, per turn. The weapon skills are uninteresting and you can easily find some weapons meant to be on the same tier, to be objectively better than its other counterparts. The combat options are pretty limited. So in many battles, you are just performing the same action, over and over again for multiple turns. Also as mentioned by several other reviews, the RNG is not in your favor. Even if you spend your resources to power up the big attack to like 97%, you can still miss. It's extremely frustrating and makes you just want to save scum.

Other 
The following aspects are something that I consider not as important when judging a roguelite dungeon crawler. 
The story is basically non-existent. This is okay if this is just a dungeon crawler, but for a real RPG experience (or as other people might claim ""DND experience"", the game NEED a real story with real characters. 
The graphics are pretty nice and the arts are pretty stylish. But again, this does not redeem a game from its bad mechanics.
The lore unlock are somewhat grindy, and the gameplay certainly doesn't make it as replayable to justify the grind. Again, this would be much better if the combat is better.

Summary
The game could be some casual fun if you play it with friends, but there are much more sophisticated games on the market with more engaging combat. Buy it if you want to play it with friends, or if you really just want to look at funny animations and click some buttons. Don't buy if you are craving a tactical RPG. If you really want have DND experience with friends, and without a DM, maybe just go with divinity original sin 2.",1688319712,1688319712,False,11,0,0.540322542190551758,0,True,False,False

I did finish the game. But it was entirely luck that I got builds that synergized. I can not recommend it for most people because it's mostly luck, and IMO strategic turn based games like this should be about decision making and strategy. And there is precious little of that here.

POSITIVES:
Looks pretty good for what it is.

NEGATIVES:
- Gameplay is very shallow, poorly explained, with ZERO character customization. 

- Success is found through luck (see below) and developing synergies between your teammates which often isn't possible due to RNG. 

-Cheezing the stack with stun-lock tricks is your money. But it really feels like cheezing. And often isn't possible anyway.

- There is no crafting.

- There is no customizing your character at all on level ups. None.

- The only customization you get is in gear, which is randomly dropped. So basically any detailed planning is out, and you're at the mercy of the dice.

- You can play well strategically and not get a good result and die 8 hours in. Start another game, same happens. Etc. etc. until you get lucky.  

- At about level 7 difficulty ramps up exponentially for no apparent reason.

- In higher levels enemies simply out scale you.

- In game documentation/explanation of mechanics and abilities is terrible. 

- Grinding for character and gear unlocks is a waste of time as most of it is complete junk. Like they just threw a bunch of stuff in to make it look like there is a bunch of stuff in. Totally lazy developers making it look like there is more here than there is.

- There are only a few good classes which are far better than the others. Again, making it appear like there is more here than there is.

- Very lazy software development overall. The game feels half finished at best.

- The expansion ramps up difficulty in all base game scenarios dramatically and sabotages you. Don't install the expansion!

- Don't expect to play co-op with friends one night and succeed. Try several nights then you might succeed, only if you're lucky. So it won't feel very rewarding if you do complete the campaign.

I played/ground about three times as many hours as I would have if I'd known the grind was bunk and I was wasting my time. 

CONCLUSION:
Highly overrated, shallow as a puddle, and if you win, its just pure luck. 
There are many similar far BETTER games out there for the money, including:

Slay the Spire
Divinity Original Sin 2
XCOM Enemy Within
Gears Tactics
Wasteland 3
etc.
etc.

Being a big fan of rogue likes myself, at first I was a little skeptical about random chances deciding the outcome of many actions, but in this game it isn't as annoying as it is in Xcom for example, the mechanic fits perfectly here. Managing your chances and progressing through the game at your own pace with 3 different difficulties to choose from whilst being pressured by time has been very elegantly implemented. I can't stand it when games pressure me with time in any setting or mechanic, but here it doesn't feel as daunting, or at least you can select an easier difficulty to get familiar with the game, which is a very specific and big upside for me personally

This game can be played with 2 or 3 friends, which I did and enjoyed a lot. Frankly, it leaves very little room for actual cooperation or working in the team because at the end you still shuffle the loot in accordance to who mains what stat, who has the gold multiplier, or who has the party heal ability, so I'd say coop is quite poopy here, although the game was so fun we had a good time nonetheless, but if you want a proper ""work in a team"" experience, this game is definitely not for you

There are plenty of different scenarios for a campaign and 3 difficulties to choose from, as well as one multiplayer only scenario. With a few fails it took me <50 hrs to complete all scenarios on a single difficulty (I also played the infinite dungeons gamemode and completed one scenario on 2 difficulties) and this is not all the content available in the game. I think it's a good amount of time for such a neat and cheap game, and it is definitely worth the investment. I shall play more in the future to fully experience the hard difficulty, all the available classes and a lore store, which is where you unlock new items, POIs and classes to use in future runs

Overall, whilst looking goofy, this game is a hidden gem which I would've missed if not for my friend showing me it in person, if you're familiar with rogue likes, then I couldn't recommend it enough",1688152484,1688152688,True,9,0,0.60619431734085083,0,True,False,False

Are you a masochistic gamer(DM me)? Do you like getting absolutely butt fucked by RNG and dying to a parrot? Well if you checked 3 out of 4 then I highly recommend this game to you. It's got easy on the eyes graphics, many different classes to play from incel Hobo to sweaty sniper Hunter, funny campaigns to run where your little character gets brutally murdered, goofy items to put on your brutally murdered characters, many different weapons to commit war crimes with, a colorful cast of monsters and absolute-top-tier-based-peak RNG you will ever fucking lay hands on. The RNG will flip your ass sideways and fist you harder than your dad to your mom yesterday. The complete randomness of the game will make for hilarious moments when playing alone(Fucking loser) or with friends. Getting comedically murdered after failing to land a single hit on a troll and landing 3 crits after the whole party attacks is all just luck of the draw Jimbo. The story is simple and enjoyable with funny mini-bosses crashing your murderspree while adventuring through the lands of Fahrul. There are only a few things I'd like to see added like achievements that say you completed a campaign. I was also hoping to see them add a 'Chaotic Mode"" where you could have 4-6 players in a single campaign. I can't really expect these additions due to FTK 2 so oh well. There are many reviews that will say the game is too hard, to them I say nay cur for thou hast a 'skill issue'. The game being 'too difficult' only fuels me to beat the game because admitting defeat is lame and for beta cucks. I spent 40 hours getting plowed by RNG and I will continue to spend more because I'm a super-mega-gigachad and it's based to get plowed.

VERY ADDICTING IF YOUR INTO RPGS,!!!

For the kings is very well made from game play, story , questing , controllers  , different items/weapons and changing maps always each game is abit different. it can be very hard at first till you pick up on stuff. One tip if you keep one guy in your party maxed out in getting the gold % buff , the avg you should be able get  them up to 40-60% extra in gear items for your payer. this will make it easier for game play in some modes. if you fight monsters aka ones steal it, let them steal the gold , kill it right after and collect with the one player you have the buff on and only them. you can get up to extra 60% plus if have it set up right.


well done :) , looking forward to your new game on its way...

Suggestions-
only thing i would suggest is for weapons/gear maybe have slots where can put runes in o increase weapon skills , add a different skill slot that you pick for player. even have a spot to upgrade the weapon in game , you can alter them. 

if there was a sandbox mode where you can set up gameplay yourself , be kinda cool.

last but not least have a player that you can make custom and add whatever you want.",1685811748,1686800339,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of my worries was that this would be another game that would become way too challenging very fast for one person to juggle but so far it isn't! As single player, you're given 3 characters to take turns between and build your own team, a lot of negative reviews about this game not being single player friendly didn't mention that. 
I haven't gotten far into the game but I already started to have to grind to level up my characters, but I expect that for every game especially one like this. It kind of reminds me of Wizard101, Icarus: Lord of the Dead, Adventure Quest, and similar games. Definitely recommend to anyone looking to play single player! Like I mentioned, there's a lot of games that are ""single and multiplayer friendly"" but ends up getting to difficult to stay single player, but this doesn't have that issue.
The only problem I've ran into is the game completely freezing when a turn ends. Not sure what causes it, maybe I'm clicking too fast on something. But that's pretty much it. Not a big deal since it saves at the beginning of every turn. Confusing at first but took me around 15-20 minutes to figure it out.",1686501702,1686501702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All party characters can use all weapons and items in the game and there's no real reason to prefer a certain profession over another. Also, when you use a ""tent"" only the character that actually used the tent can heal in it - even if the other characters are in the same square.

Some things to keep in mind.

- Enemy is faster than I am and almost always attacks before my team does except for maybe one of my team members. I basically start out at a disadvantage. This is something that should've gave you the advantage early on and slowly changed as the game progressed.
- I get the feeling of being rushed even on the easiest setting because the chaos setting is so low it happens very quickly and makes the enemy stronger. Easiest setting should've had it extremely high as a default. If you want to adjust this you lose the ability to get achievements. So fun vs. achievements.
- You can't just stick in one zone/area and build your characters up. The enemy starts to out level you if you do that instead of being a level range per zone. Again, makes you feel rushed.
- If you die you don't get a tome so it will feel like you aren't able to unlock things in the lore shop due to getting zero on some runs. Tomes are used to unlock other classes and better gear that you can get from quests. Again, feels like you need to rush to get at least one tome before you get landslided by chaos and enemies out leveling you.
- XP and gold acquisition seem really slow vs how fast enemy level.
- If you use guns you are punished because you get one shot and next turn you have to reload so basically you deal half damage because one round you do nothing but reload. I love using guns in these types of games but not even worth it. So sad.
- The RNG is not your friend. 
- Everything in this game seems to be against you. It detracts from the enjoyable experience I thought I was going to have. Definitely NEEDS a chill mode or super slow mode.

EDIT: The game mode ""Into the Deep"" is probably the most punishing and over leveled of them all so far and just ruins it all.
- There is no Chaos mechanic which is good but there is now a flood meter which if three are collect the game is over and there are no quests I've found to drop it so the (6) other ways are few and far between and in zones with enemies 4+ levels higher than you.
- EVERYTHING outside of small starter island are 4+ levels higher than me and the only enemies I can kill are on starter island. I'm level 3 and all enemies are level 1 and give maybe 3Xp a fight while I'm needing 200+XP to level. :(
- I now have 4 debuffs/enemies up. One has a chance to steal drops which it normally does to the REALLY good ones, one increases all shop prices, one puts black clouds ALL over the map and one has a chance to destroy sanctums which are those things that allow you to rez when dead.",1685236463,1685621593,False,9,0,0.539952516555786133,0,True,False,False

But whilst I love this game to death there are some small flaws within it that I would love to get ironed out. The music for example. Whilst the tracks are great its annoying how its just the same track over and over. Yes there are the boss themes but having regular combat with no variation makes it boring really fast to the point where my friends and I started playing darkest dungeon music instead of listening to this.

Next up lets get the obvious out of the way. You need friends for this game. There is regular multiplayer yes, but playing with strangers is the equivelant of putting your hand in the mouth of a sleeping crocodile. They take items they don't need to sell them, they take gold instead of sharing it and do other stupid sh*t and generally the experience is way worse.

Whilst the last two points may make the entire game sound bad I can assure you that this game is wayyyyy worth it. I paid 5 bucks and I would even recommend it for the 20 it costs right now.

Inspired by the companionship of a dear friend, Melezprens, our initial foray into this enchanting world was short-lived but filled with cherished memories. While circumstances have led me to embark on solo quests, the game's simplistic yet captivating artstyle and adherence to classic RPG tropes continue to beckon me.
For The King effortlessly marries a delightful polygonal artstyle with a sense of nostalgia, invoking memories of classic RPGs that once graced our screens. The world unfolds before my eager eyes, revealing lush landscapes and ancient ruins, each brimming with untold adventures. The attention to detail, from the delicate sway of the grass to the intricate designs of ancient artifacts, adds an immersive touch to the overall experience.
Although my journey now treads a solitary path, the memories of shared laughter and camaraderie with Melezprens linger like a comforting breeze. Our early escapades were marked by playful banter and jovial mockery, with the occasional tease when misfortune befell our dear companion. Those moments of camaraderie, even in jest, forged a bond that I hold dear.
As I traverse the ever-unfolding tapestry of For The King's world, I am reminded of the simplicity and beauty that lies within. The game's adherence to classic RPG tropes, from turn-based combat to questing for legendary artifacts, invokes a sense of familiarity and warmth. It is a gentle reminder of the foundations upon which modern RPGs are built, paying homage to the genre's illustrious history.
Though the desire to rekindle the fires of friendship within For The King remains, I have come to appreciate the solace of venturing forth alone. The serenity found in the rhythmic footsteps of my character, the quiet contemplation as I strategize my next move, all weave together in a symphony of solitary exploration. While the allure of shared adventures lingers, there is solace and joy to be found in my own personal odyssey.
In conclusion, For The King is a testament to the joys of exploration and camaraderie, evoking a sense of euphoria as I immerse myself in its captivating world. The simplistic, polygonal artstyle serves as a visual feast, while the game's adherence to classic RPG tropes pays homage to the genre's storied legacy. Whether forging ahead alone or in the company of cherished friends, For The King invites us to revel in the beauty of this digital realm and savor the adventure that awaits.",1685459285,1685459285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

if you answered no I would imagine any time allotted for gaming is few and far between, so when you make progress over a course of time( in my case 14 hours), and then lose it all because the enemies always seem to have rolls on their side. This will leave a bitter taste in your mouth like myself.

now I do want to point out the game is NOT bad it is actually really interesting and offers plenty of random and unique encounters all while balancing a myriad of different resources, but with the blatant lack of regard for your personal life and basic respect of stat mitigation due to RNG oversight it is rather punishing.

You'll reach a point in the mid-to-late game where enemies will start doing more damage than you can heal, start landing crippling debuffs every turn, and start buffing themselves flawlessly every other turn. Meanwhile, even with the best of luck, you'll fizzle spells and fail to cast even the simplest of buffs/debuffs from the start of the adventure straight to the end. 

I think the issues in balance come from enemies being treated like players as far as their hit chances, where the harder the enemy is, the more likely they are to hit/crit/buff/debuff. That might sound stupid and obvious, but beyond a certain point it becomes almost guaranteed that enemies will succeed every turn they make, whereas even with 95 in a stat, you'll regularly mess up every action you make for entire turns at a time. Enemies also scale their damage ridiculously high, to the point where even having the best armor available to you will hardly reduce it, not even mentioning some of the positively sadistic enemy design in the latter half of the game.

A lot of fights I don't want to take because I know my characters will lose most of their HP as fights are just slug-fests; it's hard to roll special abilities to protect yourself and even so most of your characters are too slow to get a good opening move. A lot of events that involve RNG rolls not in your favor I do not want to do because of the possible lose of multiple turns or experience that is hard to get as monsters quickly out level you for the dungeons you need to do. Getting equipped is based on RNG; I just happen to find a decent weapon from random fight or on some dead body that appears on the map; if I do not get that at the start of the game, the dungeon ahead will really just roll over my lives. You might have one character who gets a weapon they use while your bow user just gets nothing or you need to burn all your gold on a bad weapon from the shop if they even have gear you can use.  The Chaos bar, which pushes you to make desperate choices or to ignore far away markers on the map discouraging exploration, can make encounters more annoying with monsters getting a decent boost in HP.  You don't get anything if you want to play the game at high Chaos and it just makes the map more annoying to get around.

For The King as a solo experience is pretty tiresome or tedious. They give you the choice of playing solo to be fair, but really it was meant as fun for 3 people to communicate with.  You really need your party together for some tough encounters or to even trade gold/items when it counts, moving 3 characters solo to the same spots over and over again just makes this game drag it's feet. Also there is not much you can do if your mage just got stomped for most of his HP and he needs to wait a few turns to get 50% HP. In the end, when you play this game, to really succeed, you need to map out your moves exactly from your many failed attempts of being stomped by monsters you don't know or even how to get your characters powerful enough to make it past the mid-game. 

Get this game if you have a lot of friends for online play and when on discount. As a solo experience, it's mostly not fun for the punishing, boring, and tedious reasons mentioned",1684103179,1684103179,False,48,5,0.619925796985626221,0,True,False,False

Its art style is very enjoyable sometimes funny, especially when you blast someone in the face with a gun and they go flying, you also get to have intense fights that have you on the edge of your seat, for me on my solo play I died many times but because of mushrooms and totems i was able to come back mid fight and clutch it.

However if you decide to play solo with additional players you'll have to micro manage each player which can be a pain, I was hoping that there would be an option to have AI on your team so you could play without needing to control each player, that's the main reason I play this game with only one character. 

However my review is based on single player rather than group play, so if you are a person who's wonder if they can play this game without friends then yes you can, although it is more difficult but also very intense and enjoyable, because you only get one life unless you have mushrooms or totems, also totems are just statues you pray to for a backup life and some perks, you can only have one on at a time and they get destroyed on your death, for anyone wondering.

I definitely suggest this game to anyone. And i will also be buying the new one when it releases, although i'm hoping they have an AI option. I'd also suggest other reviews if you are going to play with friends as I haven't done that yet.",1681345623,1681345623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.",1680638039,1680638039,True,0,2,0.427350431680679321,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

We spend 7+ hours on our first go, failing 3 times.
Regardless, each time we ran the game, we understood more, and were able to progress faster. It is a hard almost rogue-like game.

WHAT I LOVE:
- How many companies give you FREE cosmetic DLCs for your character? You can be a goblin. for free. that's rad.
- Re-playable. Each map is randomly generated with random events happening. You learn and discover new things as you play.
- Really fun in a group. Although the movement on the map being turn-based is a bit challenging sometimes, it kinda adds to the charm. Forces you to strategize together. You can play as two characters instead of three and do pretty well.
- You gain currency in (almost) every game to purchase new additions to the game; classes,  cosmetics, random events, items to be added to the game. A really nice thing to see in a world of real $$$ for more content.
- Unique artstyle. Very stylized and cute. Items and names of characters are charming. Really seems like there's a lot of love poured into this game.

8.5/10 so far.

Okay game - not bad but you can skip it or try on sale.
See my profile for more details about my reviews.

Additional notes: a very pleasant take on the rogue genre, although I especially recommend playing as a coop team. Alone, maybe not so much. The game is quite harsh (you will die and die sometimes for a stupid mistake) and procedurally generated so the repetitiveness might feel tiring for many. However, the care in the details and richness of RPG content is quite genuine.

Game is very fun, i recommend playing it. But it's terribly unbalanced.First, i don't understand were the necessity is to rush you with time based mechanic where your game just ends if you reach max chaos. Game is hard enough without it and personaly I play games to relax not to have some sort of deadline and stress about it. I have it in my job and thats enough.Some characters just suck compared to others. It's mainly due to items available in game. So if your character is based on some sort of stat that goes with overall weak wepons they are just much worse. For example talent based guns. They are terrible. If you don't have focus you risk so much using them and the reward isn't even that great because they don't deal that much damage. And let's say you succeed - you have to reload next turn skipping your turn. In practice that means that if you always hit your shots you deal half damage in 2 rounds. That's just not enough compared to other weapons that maybe hit just a little less but you can deal that a little less damage 2 rounds in a row. And even if you fail to make perfect rolls you usually do some damage not 0. And if you fail your rng check on guns? You just did nothing for 2 rounds. And since game is quite complicated you can get rekt by this so much. You can get stuned rendering you useless another round, you can get shocked and if you don't have focus you will always fail your shot so you are useless for multiple turns. And not doing something in your turn is massive in this game since there are monsters that will obliterate your party if you let them move a couple times in combat. Same goes for buffs for you/your team or debuffing your enemies. In order to do anything to buff yourself/party you have to hit all rng rolls. In practice that means that if you don't have focus it's almost never worth it to try due to how punishing it is to fail. Same goes for debuffs, if you fail even one roll you do nothing. In practice that means that only party buffs are worth it to try if you can't guarantee them going though. Also i don't understand why some mediocre buffs/debuffs require so much rng checks to go though. And then you have items like bows for hunters. They have low amount of checks for insane rewards. For example you can speed up your entire party making them move a lot more just by rolling 2 checks. Also since hunters stats support bow skill accuracy you can pretty much secure game breaking party buff for 1 focus. Same goes for slows/aoe slows on enemies. Slow is so good that not only it lasts multiple turns ( same for party buff haste ) but it makes enemy move so rarely they become a joke. You have to understand that high hp, high defense monsters in this game hit insanely hard. They can kill one of your party members in 2 hits. So when you slow them you make them move so rarely that you basicly remove them as a threat. And as they hit that hard every move they do is game breaking. Thats why i think slow is actually a good mechanic: it's quite easy to debuff and rewards you with delaying Mike Tyson's punches to your team that obliterate your party. Not to mention some monsters do that but AoE! But it's overpowered compared to other buffs/debuffs in game. For example you have a skill protect that requires you to hit multiple rng rolls to put a barrier on you/your team to negate next attack. So you risk so much that you will not only fail and skip your turn but also as you fail to buff your team that big monster due is moving next soon and he just slams you. Even if you win your rolls and you protect your party there is a chance that fast moving monster will take down your protect or even better - monster will use AoE ability and take it down. Thats just trash compared to slow. Next you have stuns. They also require a lot of rolls to stun and they skip 1 turn of monster moving! Insane! Slow basicly does that but for multiple turns and it can be AoE, just xD. There are other weak abilities but those are my top 3 examples on how unbalanced the game is.Monster damage. Monsters hit sooooo hard in this game. There is a point in the game when it's not worth it to attack many camps due to how hard they will devastate your party and that you will have to use gold purchased herbs to heal or spend gold in town to heal. Oh and to and so spice, some monsters can kill you in 2 turns and they have CC effects such as shock/stun/entangle/daze. But lets say monster damage and their CC abilities can still be managed. Well they could but then you have just big fuck you abilities in game like: Minotaur attacks you and destroys your item, it's gone. Fun right? Cool, you lost your great gear and you couldn't do anything about it because I guess you were suppose to nuke down that big hard beefy guy with high HP and defense before he moves. I suppose if party buffs other than haste or debuffs like slowwere balanced you could do something to prevent it. But oh! You failed you multiple rng roll on ability and did nothing aaaaand it's his turn so get rekt. There are other abilities such as monsters that aplly acid on you and in like 2-3 moves of your character break your gear. I don't get what is fun in making a player lose their gear when often there is no counterplay due to rng. Confuse is another broken one and oh yeah it can be AoE. Monster confuses you and you perform random actions in your turn. In practice that means your character can use a very expensive consumable item for nothing and then flee encounter. Not only you are probably damaged by fighting with your enemy but you lost your consumable for free. Great mechanic! Well you could always try, ofc if you have such skill in party, to cleanse this effect from your party member ( if you are lucky enough to move before them ) but then again you have to take extreme risk to perfectly roll multiple rng checks. Monster camps. They are just not balanced. If you see that it's a camp of hard hitting high hp high defense monster it's just not worth it to do it. You will get your party hardly injured for some gold ( you will probably have to spend it to heal up your party ) and random items. You see camps always have 3 monsters so if you see camp of such op monster you will have to deal with 3 copies of him. They are sometimes harder and more dealy then final game bosses - that should tell you something. And the fact that you don't receive some better quality loot from such camps is just... bad. You can do a camp of some wimp monsters and get better rewards ( although those beefy guys give mover xp, but it's not that important compared to risk imo ).Me and my friend played all campains and you know which one we had most fun in? Water campain with sea king. And it's because it was quite easy to manage instantly ending game chaos mechanic and mechanics of the boat. And it wasn't easy. monsters were still challanging. But at least there was no stress about game ending and movement around map was not horrendous. You see, on land each hero, on his turn is rolling how far they can move, yes it's rng. So slow characters can sometimes slack off behind your party so much that its just annoying. On the other hand when you go on the boat your entire party moves together. In practice that means that even if your slow character rolls low movement your entire party still moves a little bit not just him and when your high mobility character moves he carries movement of slow hero. You can also get out of boat, explore a little and on another character turn they can pick you up back to boat - so basicly you save all that distance of backtracking. It feels nice.Okay im done with ranting. To sum up: game is still very fun and challanging even when it clearly lack balance in many aspects. I do recommend buying it. I just hope in time devs balance it a little bit to be more strategic and tactical.",1679803148,1679803148,False,2,0,0.5234375,0,True,False,False

As a co-op game, however, I find it boring, with not enough content to engage more than one person at a time.

PROS
- Many maps and scenarios to choose from
- As you play you can unlock new classes, equipment, and events, adding a roguelike feel.
- Difficulty settings are adjustable
- Unique environments to explore
- Clear mission objectives

CONS
- UI isn't the most smooth
- Not enough depth for enjoyable co-op. The game design makes it difficult to share various responsibilities equally. In CO-OP mode, there's a lot of waiting too.
- Not much content to unlock, and the pace to unlock it is slow.

However the pain starts hitting slowly after playing a bit more.

The game hides the fact that You almost can't finish the story in 2 ppl. Max players is 3, but the game still lets You start with just 1 or 2 ppl in team without actually telling anywhere ""We didn't implemented any scaling, the game can be fully played only by 3 ppl"", so any attempts hopes of slowly finishing the game in 2 ppl turns into anger.

First attempt to win... second... third... 4th.. 10th - all just to keep getting smacked by the lack of scaling.

This becomes even more problematic because in the main story the economy slaps You in the faces and slowly the prices of everything are so high that the only thing You can do with items in shops is ""looking on them"". There is no sense to fight to get money for healing herbs if You need to use the herbs You get to win the fight if You want to get money for more herbs.

Ofc. the further it goes the harder the foes are, and the more annoying they become, so it can happen that in single fight You'll get wiped without even doing to much at all, because of the ""speed up move"" skills which foes can use to move You on the end of line. To many items in inventory? Not a problem, You'll get a condition which will make Your character randomly consume items in inventory.

Want more? 

The game item drop / shop supplies is terrible. As for me the favorite character is Hunter and in expansion Treasure Hunter, but for 60+ hours of playing as hunter in 95% of time there is NO WEAPON AT ALL. Imagine going few levels further with annoying pistol from lvl 1 just because it's nowhere to be found - nowhere at all, no drop, nothing in shop, nothing in night market, nothing in treasure - zero. Over escalating? Nope, because other ppl in team got the items they need, staves, swords, tomes etc.

Expansion?

The expansion is not worth it because it's just lazy copied and pasted content with some more trees and few more foes. Even the so called ""Scurge"" are the same and now in expansion they worship some god instead of following ""the chaos""

So playing is possible only with full team, 2 ppl in team requires A LOT of organization and planning, and that still can end up badly.",1679339255,1679339255,False,47,15,0.563806056976318359,1,True,False,False

Don't be scared that the ""if you wipe, your save file is deleted"" aspect might be offputting. Most people adjust much more easily to such than one might expect.
It has a nice vibe and some funny writer moments in campaigns don't take themselves overly seriously in tone.

If you're playing as 2 people, I recommend to still use a third character and have one of the two of you control that character, as despite there being some rebalancing for 2-character parties, most encounters, and especially the difficult ones, don't seem rebalanced for that, and there is a lot of synergy, buff and debuffing that is an integral part of both the game balance and the stimulation of trying to figure out what's best to do. If 1 of your two party members debuffs all the enemies or buffs all the friendlies, it definitely is much less effective than if you are 3 party members, and thus is kind of ruins the power of a lot of crucial debuff and buff centric weapons and playstyles that are standard and optimal.",1678376269,1678376269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is very little thought put into the balancing of this game which really shines once you hit the steepest difficulty curves and you will more than often rely on the filthiest of team builds in order to have the 'slightest chance' of making it through a battle unscathed if at all.

Pros:
+ Visually appealing polygonal design, similar to Deep Rock Galactic or Valheim.
+ Challenging bosses that require you to figure out their weaknesses in order to defeat them easily.
+ Grid based world navigation with interesting random encounters that add to the randomness.
+ Variety of weapons, armors and items that make each run unique and forces you to experiment with builds.
+ Online 3 player co-op so you can suffer with your friends.

Cons:
- The aforementioned sadistically cheating AI who will always roll perfect RNG in order to maximise damage against your team. They rarely miss unless you are able to use the TWO debuffs that will guarantee a missed roll unless they can resist said debuffs, which MOST OF THEM WILL.

- Most elemental debuffs (Burning, Lifesteal, Bleeding, etc.) will very lightly inconvenience the enemies, but against you the effects are unfairly devastating and vice versa for buffs. Enemy buffs are incredibly strong but on your team will pale in comparison. Your only hope is to find armors and weapons that will resist these debuffs against you, but again, there's always something that can and will counteract that.

- With how heavily the game cheats, it feels like you've wasted hours when a boss wipes your party solely due to RNG as each run autosaves to the cloud and deletes immediately upon your defeat. Good luck trying to save scum too.

This game is great on the surface and starts out enjoyable, but quickly snowballs into a mess of unbalanced builds and sadistically designed AI with rigged dice rolls sprinkled on top.

Right out the gates it's seeming rogue-lite, but it really doesn't feel like it. The campaigns are forays that take around 7-10 hours to complete. You create 3 characters that have specializations, but are somewhat flexible in what you can have them do once you're in the campaign. On the surface the game doesn't do anything wrong and was really enjoyable for the first 10 hours, but after that you can really see the flimsy scaffold holding the experience together. 

The system gives the allusion that you'll be able to take these classes and maybe do some interesting things outside the mold--like for instance, creating a Paladin type character that heals, taunts and soaks damage--however, the kind of perfect RNG you'd need to do so is baffling. On top of that the armors and weapons aren't truly dynamic or varied enough that you can really stray too far from the class archetypes. 

It was fun to chase loot, but the pool is so small that you aren't really gonna have any surprises after you make it through the first playthrough. 

In the end the combat is dull and punishing. You mostly smash the same button over and over. I likened it to early turn based games like Final Fantasy 1-4 or something, but it has no deep story to hold your attention or real nuances to the characters to allow for attachment. Every battle, even against normal enemies usually leaves you drained or poisoned or cursed. Combat only feels fun for the first few levels, when you don't have to full heal/cure/bless after every battle. There isn't that sweet spot where you ever really feel strong, you always feel like you're hanging on by a thread. 

I feel mostly disappointed. Really wanted a game to sink my teeth into, but it just didn't have the depth I wanted. I tried to make it more than it was: It's a simple game, if you go in with no expectations you'll be pleasantly surprised, but it's a NO for me.

I don't particularly enjoy the over reliance on rng. Improving your stats feels unreliable because of this feature, and winning certain battles feels entirely up to chance. However, in co-op with friends, it makes the session feel so much more alive. The lack of consistency adds a lot of adrenaline pumping action and excitement. And because of this, I'm willing to overlook my negative opinion about this.

But there's one thing I can't ignore - pure support spells. 

For example, attacks that can cause bleed, stun, burn, etc, are fine the way they are. If they don't get a perfect roll, the status ailments don't apply. However, some damage still goes through, so even if you get a bad roll, the attacks aren't completely useless. But when it comes to support skills that solely boost armor or even attack, it feels too punishing to use. If you get a bad roll when trying to armor up, absolutely nothing happens. Not even a small bit of damage, not even a smaller portion of the buff gets implemented. 

Why? 

It feels much more reliable to use another attack that just deals damage than to use a spell that only ""tries"" to give you an attack buff but nothing else. Even if it's a party buff, the risk seems too high for the reward it gives. Why can't you get an incremental buff based on how bad of a roll it is? Maybe instead of giving you nothing when you roll a 3/5, it should give you 60% of the original buff. Or maybe, in the case of a party buff, it applies only to the caster on a bad roll. That way, it doesn't feel like the spell is so significantly more punishing than all the other attacks you could use instead. And these are just a few examples I personally came up with. There's probably a ton of other better ideas out there. 

I wouldn't have cared so much about this if not for the fact that most users of these support spells are magic users. And because of this fact, magic classes feel inherently weaker than their physical counterparts given that they have less options to damage the enemy. Honestly, I'm all for making the game more punishing, but if support spells suck, you should also make every other attack in the game suck just as much. Because with how it is right now, it makes playing support classes feel somewhat obsolete. 

This is just one problem I have about this game. I'm sure there's more that others have mentioned. Overall, the game feels unbalanced... as if it's in early access. But maybe that's just me. It's still pretty fun though.",1675755436,1675755617,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

I played on normal difficulty all throughout and have only completed one campaign (there is three campaigns and then a few extra decently fun modes). 

I do think the game is brutally unfair at times, even warranting an alt-f4 to reload (I think for the next game unless they fix this brutal unfairness they should have quick-save/quick-load). 
By brutal unfairness, there is some things that can demolish you simply because of a bad dice-roll. I do understand this is intentional, as it is meant to mimic a DnD type style, but I think it would put loads of people off - even saw some reviews that echoed this thought.

When you begin the game, there is a pop up box that does warn players that they will not be successful at this game initially, and that there is a significant learning curve required in order to become successful.

That being said, do yourself a favor and withhold judgement on this game until you really understand how it works.  I can honestly say, it took me well over 30 games to truly understand how ALL of the mechanics work, and how to manipulate them towards success.

The designers of this game took into account all aspects of traditional D&D and you have to respect the mechanics to win.  I will list a few examples to demonstrate what I mean by this.

1. Low armor will result in higher average damage taken.
2. Balance attack damage with some sort of defense (armor, magical, dodging...)
3. Understand which weapons relate to which primary stats.
4. Comprehend which types of weapons deal greater damage towards certain monsters.
5. Pay attention to the defenses of the monsters, I.E. Immunities, armor, etc...
6. Always keep in mind who has the next attack in the rotation.
7. Try to eliminate monsters in fights BEFORE they can attack.
8. Invest one character in your party as a designated healer.
9. Understand what is worth spending gold on, and what can be easily farmed.
10. Make sure your party is balanced from a statistical point-of-view. STR/INT/DEX etc.
11. Be sure that all party members use different types of equipment.
12. Eliminate Scourges as quickly as possible and avoid battle until you do.
13. Always reduce Chaos as often as possible, do not rely on replenishing life heart.
14. Always allow Scourges to emerge.  Once killed, they have great items.
15. Pay close attention to the health of your ship.  Particularly if the Kracken is still lurking.
16. Avoid the Kracken by staying close to shore.
17. Always replenish your health/magic BEFORE you purchase items in towns.
18. Perform all quests from towns, the rewards are substantial.
19. Buy out all God's Beards every opportunity you have.  They are your health potions.
20. Make sure EVERYTHING on all characters are in synergy before you attempt to finish the game.

I could go on about the mechanics, but I am sure you get the idea.  This game will punish you for not having the proper balance in your party.  The game will punish you for going into a battle that you are not prepared for in any way.  Most all battles in this game have the ability to end your quest.  Take them seriously.

Once you have learned the mechanics effectively, this game is a blast to play, particularly on a LAN with your family.  Happy hunting and I hope this review is helpful to somebody.",1640665670,1674331673,True,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

-Did I mention WAY too much RNG?

I wish I could get my money back, game is very disappointing since I had no idea just how much RNG is involved.
There are mobs that can only be hit if you roll a PERFECT attack, but wait ! they have armor too ! which means they won't die in a hit, and if you choose to use an armor piercing hit it has and even LOWER CHANCE OF HITTING !
Then if you somehow get lucky and hit with the armor piercing hit, guess what ? the mob has the same HP as a normal mob FOR NO FREAKING REASON so you could literally just lose half your HP on ALL party members because you fail again and again to hit it\finish it off.

DO NOT BUY!

Don't take note of my low playtime - I've been mostly playing local co-op on my partner's account.

✔️ The combat & exploration mechanics are both rather simple to understand for a new player, and deep enough not to become bored on a longer term.
✔️ A huge amount of content to explore, including some that is unlocked over the course of several playthroughs.
✔️ The difficulty is rather enjoyable, with a constant risk of failing the run if you make mistakes, while remaining quite forgiving of a few mistakes.
✔️ Pretty cool (despite being simple) low poly environment & character designs.
✔️ Remarkable music, that really contributes to the ambience.
✔️ Very nice couch co-op experience.

❌ Some gameplay elements are (probably voluntarily) obscure and require the player to kind of figure them out by themself (and maybe lose a game or two because of that). Some additional clarity would have been welcome - for instance for details on some status effects, or the descriptions of some weapon skills.
❌ I'm not sure about the balance for games with less than 3 characters. I think the game has been balanced for 3 characters, and I don't think it really adapts to smaller parties?
❌ The story is more of an excuse than anything else. It works well as an excuse too, but having a bit of a thicker plot could have been enjoyable.
❌ Online multiplayer seems a bit weak, it only works with both a really good ascending and a really good descending internet transit on the host's side.

Overall I definitely recommend this game as a fun co-op experience in couch play. Not sure I would have enjoyed it as much in solo, but with friends it's definitely worth it.",1669430032,1673441844,True,0,0,0.472972989082336426,0,True,False,False

The starting campaign is For The King though, which if you buy the DLC, is no longer the default one. I figured the ""Lost Civilization"" campaign it started us on was a tutorial or something, no, it's the much harder DLC. So my first couple games were miserable.

But once you get on the first one, it's a phenomenal (through brutality) D&D-esque game.

You move on a hexagon grid map, can manipulate the movement and actions in different ways, and overall have a lot of tools to empower your weak party into becoming mighty enough to take down the boss. But watch out for the strong enemies, random encounters, Kraken, economic inflation, and more.

Great time with friends, awesome time locally with my wife. Just make sure whoever is playing wants to 1. Be mentally involved in the game they're playing, because it's a lot of math and making decisions based on information available on screen. 2. Is ready for a multi-hour expedition that you will open, play for awhile, close, come back to, possibly close again, maybe die, who knows. You could try to speedrun one of these campaigns but I'm assuming it'd at least take 4 hours still as you argue about how to optimize parts of your run.

Buffing up certain stats and making tradeoffs with gear all appeal to the idea of management and min-maxing your adventure RPG get up.

There are multiple types of maps you can play to switch up the variety and that was a really nice change of pace compared to most games where it's only one story.

FTK is worth it at full price without DLC. DLC are worth it on sale. 
I recommend this game if you are not familiar with this genre of games. It does not have a whole load of mechanics so it is a good starting point, but it might be too simple for people who have played more complex turn-based strategy games. For the King has remote play together, which means if someone on your friendslist has it you can play together without the other people needing to buy it.


For the King is a singleplayer or coop isometric turn-based open world RPG. It can be compared to games like Xcom, Wildermyth, Battle Brothers and Wasteland, and although it is a much simpler than those games that is not necessarily a bad thing. 
The simplicity of this game makes it a great starting point for this genre of games and also makes it allot more casual, great for chill coop with friends.
For singeplayer, there are better games out there but this one will do the job, coop is way more fun though. There is an official discord where you can find people to play with, but it is better with people you know.

The game has 4 main campaigns, 1 DLC campaign, 1 Endless mode and 1 versus minigame (Still PvE but more of a race against your friends). 

All 5 campaigns are very well done, they each have their own unique mechanics. I am not the biggest fan of the end dungeons in most of the campaigns (except for the Into the Deep) because they have allot of special enemies with unfair attacks. The dungeon crawler campaign is my favorite as it is randomly generated and very replayable.

The endless mode does away with the campaign map in favor of a dungeon, just fight after fight with only events like shops in between. This was enjoyable and a good way to test synergies.

The versus minigame is not good. It doesn't really work as the game is built for coop and people stealing items from each other or having to wait for someone's fight to end was not fun.

This mode could use a rework and I would not recommend giving this one a go until it gets changed. I doubt it will though.

The game has allot of replayability as the campaigns are semi-randomly generated.


The game has a lore store, which is your main form of progression. As you do quests and dungeons in campaigns you earn lore books. You can use these as currency in the store to unlock new events, cosmetics and weapons for your campaigns. This is good, not too grindy and always gives you something to work towards.

The difficulty system is not too great. The game has 3 difficulties; Apprentice (easy), Journeyman (medium) and Master (hard). Apprentice is nice and chill, Journeyman is a good challange but Master difficulty has some problems.
Most campaigns have some sort of threat which increases over time if you don't continue the quests, incentivising you to push forward. The higher the difficulties have more time pressure.
Master difficulty forces you to speedrun, which isn't too bad on it's own but if you combine that with the random nature of an RNG based game, you get a short time to get allot done.
In my Master campaigns I was forced to abandon and retry campaigns when the RNG wasn't going my way, turning the game into more of a rogue-like as opposed to a multi-session campaign.
I just recommend avoiding this difficulty unless you mean to 100% the game.

As a completionist, this game is quite easy to 100%. The hardest steam achievement is doing the main campaign on the highest difficulty, which is just trial-and-error.",1670439474,1671855514,True,32,0,0.780187904834747314,0,True,False,False

It is unpolished in many areas such as UI, story [there isn't really one], and end-game balance but the low-poly models look great and fit the aesthetic of the game perfectly. It's very difficult but fair when you consider all of the options you're given as a player. It's one of the rare games that requires you to understand nearly every game mechanic to have even a chance of survival. Campaigns are also time-sensitive and players start out extremely weak in comparison to enemies, which feels like an cheap way to inflate difficulty. Nearly every other game rewards mechanical skill in the player, but there's no aspect of mechanical skill in this game - only preparation and knowledge. It's an interesting take, but a somewhat frustrating one for a pseudo-random roguelike.

For example, one person can go to a town, peruse the shop comparing equipment stats against the ones equipped, and the other 2 players have to wait for them to finish. Players can get into combat without the whole group and the players not in the combat just have to sit there and wait until their turn comes up.

Looting in combat is a terrible round-robin mechanic where one player gets a piece of loot and can choose to take it or pass it on, until someone takes it. It then gives the next piece of loot to the next player letting them take it or pass it on. Repeat until no items left. This is bad, because RNG can screw over a player from getting any useful loot. If players are trying to be helpful, then it just leads to asking if anyone needs something every single reward, players comparing their equipment, etc., which just leads to more downtime. The game should just give everyone their own loot.

Ultimately, the game isn't too fun. The events, combat, items, etc. are very bare bones and extremely RNG.",1670448730,1670448730,False,3,0,0.490821331739425659,0,True,False,False

Like if you took a CRPG game like Pathfinder, Dragon Age, Baldurs gate and stripped out most the role-playing-game aspects of it. Or if you took the tenseness and gameplay out of Darkest Dungeon, or if you took 99% of the things you could do in a DnD inspired game away. There is not a fun game left over. The game is short, and boring, and has fairly little to do, and you have to beat a ""run"" to unlock more points of interest, which are also not fun, and add little more content even after unlocking all of them.

Its a nice game, and for the price you cant argue that. 
With solo and co op capabilities its has a lot of potential in the right hands of people with higher attention spans it has a lot to offer.
Once past the first (new game learning curve), its actually pretty simple turn based table top game with rogue like features.
With plenty of character's to pick from some unlocked and some locked behind challenges, with weapons for each class and attributes chained to the class it makes for decent build as you go class building. After a few hours you get a good grasp on the game and it sucks you in. With friends this is amplified by 10x, atleast for me. So far this has been my experience with the game. Ill expand on this lets say at 100 hours with more details.

Whether a fight will be a breeze or resulting in heavy damage is often decided by a singe dice roll in the opening turn. These extreme binary outcomes make fights shallow as it limits the influence of player choices.

The overworld navigation is a drag, every party member has to be controlled individually one after the other. And again poorly implemented RNG playes a role in this, as the number of moves is partly decided by a dice roll at the start of a turn. It is tedious. This also means every character has it's own inventory and gold, which doesn't add anything interesting and just leads to tedium as you'll have to do a bunch of inventory management via a sub-par inventory screen.

This is a fun game being held back by some glaring issues. Many people complain about the RNG with the rolls, but at the end of the day, that's just RNG. What truly cripples the fun in this game is the fact that everything is so heavily stacked against you. Even when you have everything unlocked.

There are enemies you should just straight up ignore on your playthroughs because they can cause an end to your current run. Thats not ""challenging design"". There is no fun in having to completely avoid something implemented in the game because its just scaled so heavily against the player.

This mainly stems from enemies almost always getting perfect rolls. While we start at around 70-80 in our main stat while eventually and hopefully scaling it up to 90-95 for late game, enemies seem to clearly have 95 in their main stat from the start. You genuinely pray and grit your teeth whenever the enemy goes. The only solid counterplays to avoid this is to shock them so they always fail 1 roll, or have high evasion so they just dont touch you, or the 3rd option, which is the meta, just outspeed them to the point they never go.

That's right. One of the successful ways (in my opinion with the least amount of stress) to beat Master is praying you get the right items that allow you to just never let the enemy go while you kill them, because it is simply too risky to ever let them damage you. 

Why don't enemies scale stat-wise with progression? Or at the least, don't have all the enemies main stats at 95 so they are perfect rolling in Apprentice and Journeyman. Save the unfair uphill scaling of their stats for Master.

I genuinely think the game would be so much better if they just appropriately scaled the enemies instead of claiming ""you will die a lot, just keep trying"". Trust me, after 300 hours and everything unlocked, you are still dying a lot. It's just bad design. You can keep the ""seemingly"" skewed RNG rolls, it's just defeating when the enemy almost never fails their rolls unless you conterplay it, whilst they get to laugh as you miss 1 single roll out of your 3 and they dodge for two turns straight.

Don't get me wrong, you can definitely enjoy this game. But it seriously feels like they just gave up on some mechanics and just artificially inflated enemy stats to compensate. 

There is so much more - I think the biggest issue is there simply is too much RNG. To the weapons you get and the positions of your start and towns and what sanctums spawn and even what enemies show up when and where. There is very little that is ""constant"" in this game. While I love having randomness in every run so there is always something new, it just feels gross and unforgiving, like there is no incentive to truly explore because going in the wrong direction could mean chaos creeping in since you cant make it to the right place in the right time or a random event that skews more to just screwing you instead of helping you.

This leads me to my second and probably biggest complaint. The multiplayer networking is atrocious. The first issue is they don't advertise any of the already in-game options for multiplayer, instead funneling everything to Discord, a 3rd party app, for multiplayer networking. This is fine and all, but believe it or not, Discord doesnt make up the majority of the playerbase. Most people want to just join in-game and use in-game chat; not having to worry about having to use a 2nd app just to communicate in-game.

There should be an in-game friend list, an in-game block list, in-game voice chat along with the already existing text chat. Implement a matchmaking queue instead of having us make lobbies and name them ""JOIN"" so people do. And then you have the region-hoping issue. Since they split the servers via region, the majority of the playerbase is heavily fractured. I have played with plenty of people across the globe and there is almost never latency issues, so why separate the servers into regions? If there isn't going to be a latency issue anyway (especially since its a turn-based game where thats not really an issue), just merge all the servers into one so your playerbase doesnt have to leaf through the different regions to find open rooms.

With all of this said, I still think its a fun game, just seriously being held back by some issues that in my opinion are just too much to overlook. I really hope their explanation of having a small team when they initially made For the King can excuse this, and that their continued work on For the King 2 with a larger team and larger budget will come to fruition.",1669348484,1669348484,False,120,10,0.793571412563323975,0,True,False,False

Two, the loot/gear was fun to gain and upgrade (though weapons can break at any moment during a fight, so don't invest too much into one weapon)  The different type of enemies and challenge to find the best strategies to fight them.

However, after a few restarts to try to get past about 10th level without the world collapsing in on you, I gave up.   My partner and I were looking for a fun and relaxing game, not a rush against time where you either have to rush in and get killed (and you only get so many lives before you lose the game), or try to take some time to level up so you can not get killed so easily, and end up dying anyway due to the ""doomsday timer"" type mechanic.

For example, one ""fun"" global effect is a jester that reduces all of your chances to succeed on your rolls. Cool.

Combat is 99% ""press attack"" over and over and hope you win. The support skills on weapons don't last long enough to be useful and most enemies have immunity to the common status effects.

They say you get punished for the mistakes you made in the game but no, most of the time, it is just RNGesus and somehow a global miniboss trying to screw you alive because you cannot kill him due to its imba abilities which is fine because you get learn and get stronger as you play, right? Wrong. We have been playing RNG games too long to understand that we always have a backup plan, but turns out the game forces you to have a success cap at 95%. Not that bad huh? Wrong again, because once it fails, one of your teammates might be targeted by every enemies in the fight, with their good rolls against your lousy rolls, downing you to near death state. There are heals right? Yup, one way to heal battle, one way to heal after battle, and that's it. You have to drag your way back to town for more pots or rest again and again for each time RNGesus decide to mess you up which feels like a chore and that makes the game too long. When a run is long, value of replayability becomes a question, and it is further depreciated when the story quest is linear. If you think that each character have different builds, think again, especially for their starting passive skills, you will be probably be sticking to the build meant for that skill, thus, it becomes a no-no to replayability. Furthermore, no matter what enemy encounter, they will always attack first most of the time and no such thing as winning a fight without taking any damage which is fine until you realise taunts by tanks and cures by healers can fail even by a one failed die roll (imagine failing 4 times in a row with 80% success rate) meaning there are no mitigations on your failures when the dev decide your backup plans will be capped like your character stats. When you think of playing and working smart, the game says no you should be playing and working hard. You cannot even avoid RNG at times, and will be forced to take the pain and death because RNGesus decide this will not be your successful run. In this game you do not make and solve your mistakes, you begin the game with a mistake to solve in order to become another mistake, With the current variety of gears in this game, I dare say that some of the gears are pointless as there is stats capped and even with the different classes involved, you will know that trying different build is not worth the time since RNGesus, once again, is involved and decides to give the same loot roll to you. Not that you can lock out the equipment that you are not going to use because of your party setup.

Long grinding game runs should not be a market of game's replayability. The variety of choices and different story quest pathlines should be what makes roguelike game value in its replayability.",1668101363,1668101363,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its like joining your local cult. It seems fine at first glance, everything is so welcoming so you dwell deeper only to find yourself surrounded by crapload of unfinished ideas.
This joke of an adventure can be describe with one word -> ""random"". Starting this game is commiting to the RNGesus himself and his abyssal predecesors to find out that your warrior can't find through entire campaign single item and what is worse - this is your daily For The King. Shops are so randomized that only thing that is sure is that half of that items will probably be useless to anyone. After a few hours you will find ourself traveling to find very limited healing game is offering you.
But lets talk about enemies. At first lvls they have their gimmicks, they can be a problem but futher you go, you start to feel like lost peasant who meet a casual horde of rampaging orcs. Enemies hit like a truck that makes you wonder if you are supposed to be reincarnated in some neiche isekai after what they done to you and everyone of them is master swordsman who can't miss a single hit and is immune to every negative status to make sure you will feel the pain playing this game.
What is funny that im still playing this game and will probably play For the King 2.

Game looks nice, sounds promising - tabletop elements, multiplayer, several adventures to play, positive reviews...

So why there are only ~1000 players ever playing it?

[h1]It is not what it looks like[/h1]

This game is another grindfest for your time in disguise.
Except you are grinding for your own feeling of pride and sanity.

[i]I cant be that bad, right? I am doing something wrong? Game even says it's okay to lose my first adventure, I am surely gonna open few more power ups and get good![/i]

Nope, you are not.

People will tell you most basic things ever - ""buy healing potions"", ""dont the party"", give heavy hammer to your str hero. Whaow, high level tactics!

[h1]Game is very unfair toward players[/h1]
- Players roll seems rigged. You can regularly miss 3-5 concussive rolls per run with your main stat.
- Enemy stats are higher than players on the same level.
- Enemy abilities and items are better than players. They also allow themself to suicide just to stale the party. For example - wolves and some spirits will AOE drain your Focus on first turn. They have extra high speed, there is no counter to that.
- Enemy rolls seem rigged as well. I've seen one enemy roll 28 concussive success rolls, that was fun (reset-stun-damage combo).
- Healing is limited. Amount of damage you can safely take per encounter is limited, or you are loosing in the long run.
- Gold limited. Means town rest is limited too.
- Inflation means you cant save a penny, lategame tavern rest costs 250 gold.

The list may go on. As someone have already mentioned in another review - this game is lacking any feeling of progress. Enemies will always deal ~1/3 damage to your HP, unless hitting your main defensive stat and you are not nullified. Best case scenario it wall always take you same amount of turns to slay enemies, otherwise game will punish you for prolonging battles by dealing damage you cant recover.

By the time I got my ""cool"" 45 magic damage staff enemies have 180 hp and 20 magic shield. Not so cool.

The main lie this game tells you - is presence of options. You wanna win? There are no options for you.
Forget about such things as:

- Lifesteal, cure, protect, reflect, wet, ignite, bleed and many others. That's pure garbage, that will give you a hard time on mid difficulty and insta fail expert run.

You need: focus restore, reset, bash and some other top-tier weapons/skills.

The game can be approached with friends as a co-op adventure or solo as one of those turn-based RPGs with multiple combat units. It's been a good experience so far. As I write this my party and I are on the verge of completing the main campaign and defeating the final boss.

Everything in this game seemed well balanced, though we were playing on Apprentice so perhaps ""Normal"" difficulty might change this opinion. The weapons mostly all have their advantages and drawbacks. Firearms are very powerful but require a turn to reload. Some of the strongest weapons will shatter if you miss a roll (sometimes feels unfair). Two-hand is stronger than one-hand but you can't use a shield. Some weapons are weaker but apply DoT or some other ailment. Etc etc.

The enemy types are creative and are what's to be expected from an RPG of its type. There are around 30 base designs with some having regional and ""difficulty-scaled"" variants. Wizard Crabs are unexpectedly strong. I think the Scourges, various unique bosses that scale with difficulty and arise in random orders, are a nice addition.

The Chaos mechanic hasn't been much of a threat since we've managed to keep it down through various means. As I understand, if Chaos reaches level three, every few tiles will be monsters.

Overall I'd say For The King is a solid title; a good time with friends or family if you can convince them to try it with you. Use your imagination and see what kind of character you end up with. Although the RNG might set you back, just about any build is achievable. I'm eager to see what kind of team I'll put together in future runs.

But at some point in the game, the enemies just become super overwhelming. It feels like they are playing a different game then we are playing. 

Our ""heroes"" just feel like regular townsfolk who wondered too far out of the village while every enemy has 40 dmg AOE abilities that add a burn and take away your focus. Don't worry you can use your very limited God's beards that end up costing 200-300 gold at level 10 to heal every turn so you don't die. Every enemy is immune to 8 things, has physical and magical shields, and hardly ever miss their rolls. 

In my opinion, this game doesn't need to be a rouge-like. The game feels very long and tedious which is fine in a classic RPG adventure, but not in a game you have to restart when you die. Our 9 hour first run has exhausted me and my buddies. We don't feel satisfied about the 9 hours, in fact we feel like they were wasted, which makes us not want to start another run at all. I think this game is awesome, i really like turn based games and one i can play with friends is just icing on the cake.

For many fights it seems the enemies aren't playing with the same system the players are forced to play with. They'll succeed every attack even stuns and dazes, despite those same options for players being much less likely without focus or very high stats. The only chance for success is either an insane level of min-maxing, or just an incredible amount of good RNG. There's no good form of healing for the players, and instead we're forced to rely on a limited form of resources that get increasingly more expensive. The random elements make some runs feel not worth it, and it feels especially bad to get hours in only to be put in a situation that's impossible to recover from.

Craziest turn-based rogue game I ever played.

- enemies spawn and despawn randomly
- random events, ambushes, curses determines you win or not
- dying = cant continue where you left

90% of the time it will be against your odd, you have to exit so the odds sides ya

It also uses accuracy for attacks. Lets say you have 80 strength, and the axe you use have 3 rolls:

- each roll has 80% chance to be succesful.
- 3 rolls succesful = full weapon dmg.
- 2 roll succesful = 2/3 weapon dmg.

Focus system is introduced to guarantee success for rolls.

Where to get health/focus is via herbs through killing things, bought at town or rest. Every supply is very important you need to prepare before you enter any dungeons. Once entered you either complete the dungeon or die, restarting the whole game again. Complete madness!",1664683718,1664683718,True,3,0,0.491733044385910034,0,True,False,False

I think I can leave an honest review after around 150 hours, played all game modes in single and multiplayer and got all achievements.
The idea is interesting, the game appeals to tabletop enjoyers, but it is not very fun. Quite boring at the beginning until you unlock a few items, decent in the mid progression, boring again when everything is unlocked. Classes are not very different from each other besides some insignificant stats and some passives that never seem to activate.
The RNG is horrible especially on higher difficulties, sometimes it feels like it is not random at all. It feels like the devs wanted you not to have fun on a game you just payed for. Higher difficulty only means that your attack rolls fail more often, that's all. For example on the highest difficulty I had a character with 50% critical chance, but only dealt critical damage in 40 hits out of 200 attacks. This does not look like 50% to me and it happened in multiple runs.
The only way to beat this game at higher difficulties is to reload your save when any fight goes wrong (and oh boy, everything will go wrong).
The story is unremarkable, after 150 hours I can safely say that it is nothing that might be remembered even accidentally.
Maps feel quite the same, similar enemies, similar goal (beat that boss with huge health bar and no new mechanics compared to normal enemies before a counter reaches 4 for absolutely no reason), similar maps (one on normal land, one on snow, one in jungle, one on water, and a combination of all without a final boss)
The bonus game modes are garbage, infinite dungeon rooms (great! you took out the exploration from the game, sure, just delete the best part and leave the unfair RNG) and a 5 minute long pseudo-PVP.
Personally I think that games that have hidden achievements are just lazy and of course this is one of them. Feel free to disagree with me, i still think this is a small minus for some people.
I bet my left nut that ""For the king 2"" will be just the same regarding RNG and difficulty.",1664645857,1664645857,False,1,1,0.489146918058395386,0,True,False,False

Pros:

Big time replayability -- and if you like there is a cheap DLC that adds new campaigns and characters to keep things fresh.
Unlockables that encourage ""One more Game"" -- but if you can always play with other people who have other stuff unlocked to get a sneak peek.
Classes are variable and play differently, community that plays the game is instructional and positive -- unlike other games with community toxicity I've only had good experiences finding partners to play with.
Simple to learn but with astounding depth, game has just the right mix of intensity and humor to it.
Loot is fun, varied and very enjoyable and RPGs that get their loot systems right so much more fun!

Also a great entry point for RPGs and can be played both casually and very challenging depending on settings and scenario.

PROS:
- Time itself is a resource.
- Health also is a resource, in contrary to most RPG's here you need to regularly choose between risking to die and using an item/money. Also limited life pool.
- No pre-combat buffing!
- randomness countered by ""focus"" mechanic, but still Your RUN's can be quite random.

CONS:
- Inventory UI sucks balls. Depending on situation You can or can't access what you actually wear or what your companions have in their inventory. Probably some engine limitation/bug, but very, very annoying.

This game holds promise at first and keeps you coming with it's challenge, but after a while it gets boring. really boring. and TEDIOUS. I cannot say that enough, this game becomes the height of tedium very quickly due to the mentioned endless spamming of status effects, some of which have no real counter. 

Most character classes are hot garbage and not worth using and exist as little more than another attempt to steal your time with substandard characters. and you realize it's just a boring unbalanced mess of garbage that wastes what promise it holds

 And let's not go into how the developers abandoned the console versions which are like 2 years behind updates. but hey it's not like any of the updates heighten the experience. 

At the end of the game enemies are bags of health that spam status effects nonstop. It's cheap and boring. Don't waste your money on this junk. there's better roguelikes out there. MUCH better.

-online and offline co-op which is rare in games these days.
-lots of different classes to play.
-Has tones of replay value with different game modes and a in game no microtransactions store that actually rewards you with better loot in future runs for playing well. 
- Very cheap and reasonable price especially if it’s on sale even without that it’s a bargain for the amount of content you get in the game. 
Overall, I love this game originally played it on Xbox game pass and now I've bought it on steam. Genuinely can't recommend this game enough. not everyone will love it but if you've got a love for turn-based/ tabletop/ turn-based JRPGs give this game a go I don't think you'll be disappointed.

The good:
-interesting and deep combat mechanic, especially if you like a tactical turn based approach and do not mind rng
-challenging difficulty
-while I am not a big fan of low poly art, the overall artistic theme is well done, and the music and animations are very good
-I only played single palyer, but it seems to be fun to play in coop as well

The bad:
-do not expect a very deep narrative, the story is just there to justify the game
-it can get repetitive after some time

-Co-op
-Great variety of characters and balancing

-Easy to learn, feels like playing a great co-op adventure RPG board game
-One player can control mulitple characters, so you can play with a full party even if you don't have 3 friends available to always play (also is drop-in, drop-out)

Dislikes: 
-Wish the maps were a bit larger and had a bit more variety in terrain and city sizes/variations
-Sometimes cave/boss dungeons are decieving. They will say level 4 for example, and then you get to the last fight and all of the enemies are level 7 and you get destroyed

This shows up in two ways: the first, perhaps forgivable error is to put everything on a clock.  You have only so many turns until bad things happen or the game ends.  While the time pressure in and of itself isn't bad - lots of roguelikes have a food mechanic to keep you exploring - one of the keys to success in traditional roguelikes is that sometimes it's better NOT to fight!  Tackling some really heinous monster might end your run, or if you survive, have to expend far too many resources like potions or wands to make the victory worthwhile.  Unfortunately, For The King is pretty bad about this: there are too many fights you absolutely have to have, because letting a miniboss run free would simply be too punishing.

The second, more fatal flaw: the game seems to be built around the assumption that you will shamelessly exploit mechanics that allow you to deny the enemy a turn or never let your own turn end.  A number of bosses seem to be designed to be unbeatable in any other way.  The two problems with this are that first, One True Build To Win is pretty boring; there's no room for creativity.  The second, fatal problem is that denying the enemy a turn/giving your side more turns is entirely gear dependent, since this is a roguelike.  You are 100% reliant on RNG (Random Number Generator) giving you the right puzzle pieces to win the game, and since you're on a limited map with a clock, there's no guarantee you'll get those pieces.  

This is, to put it mildly, incredibly frustrating and disrespectful of the player's time.  

There's nothing wrong with a game being hard, and there's nothing wrong with being heavily RNG dependent, but to have a game where the ONLY path to victory is dependent on the RNG giving you just the right pieces of gear is mostly just a timesink.  

Save yourself some time and roll a six sided die.  If you get a six, congratulations!  You beat For The King!

It is fun + frustrating, a bit of a challenge for those interested, and that's a good thing.

I can't recommend the game however, because I found the artificial difficulty in the procedurally generated + a near 30% full system crash rate at launch to be beyond my threshold of tolerable frustration. 

Details: Honestly, my personal taste on the pitfalls of what I am deeming ""artificial difficulty"" should be taken with a grain of salt, obviously, that may be exactly what you are looking for. The part that soured me was after running into many situations in game where I felt that I was unable to proceed (which was to be expected, sure) I wasn't dead, and was left without an avenue to progress. An example of this is being in the bog and then surrounded by poisoned ground with absolutely no path to my goal. There are items to use to fix this, but having to move in then out then back into the bog, it quickly burned up my resources. Okay, rogue-like elements at play, fight-Die-Repeat, I understand. So, I take a break, let my stupid brain digest come back. 

The steel I-beam that broke the camel's back was in coming back and starting up the game, it was a roll of the bones on whether it would crash my system. That's a bit much. I think about who I could recommend this game to, and honestly, anybody I know who plays games would quickly get pissed at me for recommending this based on that experience, thus I am unable to confidently recommend, sorry.",1661619576,1661619576,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

let me start with this:
This game is actually a blast, the only reason I am giving this game a negative review is because it has a mechanic that really annoys me when I run into them in games. But that is what reviews are, to state your opinion and preference of a game. So here we go with the good first:

1. I love the exploration of this game.
You can build boats and ships, sail across seas, fight Kraken and pirates, as well as skeletons and magical creatures; there is plenty of creative beings and lands to explore!

2. The loot itemization is also pretty decent.
-It's not like....Diablo 2 itemization, but it's still pretty good. There is always plenty of gear to find and you never know what you are going to get; there are plenty of different variations of items for you to be able to complete your build for your characters.

3. The builds are actually pretty cool and just advanced enough to be fun.
-As you play, you can start unlocking different character builds as well, which adds a much more diverse experience.

4. The currency is well balanced.
-I always seemed to have JUST enough for what I needed each play through I did. I was never super rich, but I was never super poor either. I could always afford what I needed without being seriously way to broke for something.

Alright so, out with the bad now....

1. The speed of the game:
-Ok, there is like....no chill in this game. Which really ticks me off tbh because the game is sooooo good otherwise. Unless you are decently smart and efficient about how you move and spend your time, the game entire starts making the enemies tougher. I am not sure what the point of this is, I already have a quest and am already battling enemies as it is. I get that my aversaries would normally be getting stronger as I also progress, but it just seems a little......too fast is all. I wasn't able to slow down and feel the adventure of the game because it seemed like every time I looked up to the top of my screen, the Queen was raging about how the darkness is spreading and I would get an update about how the enemies got stronger.

I understand the concept behind this, but it just made me feel rushed and anxious, it made me feel like I missed a lot and that the END was my only goal. The same feeling I get as if I were late for work.

Anyways, that is my only complaint, but for me, I really DO NOT like being rushed in a game.

I hop this helps for anyone considering to buy, if you don't mind the challenge of being rush somewhat against a ticking clock, then you'll have a blast with this game.

Absolutely incredible co-op or solo roguelike table top-esk RPG.
It plays a lot like a DnD campaign without the roleplaying, you can move across the over world, explore, go to towns, buy boats, upgrade gear, fight stuff and level up or find a bunch of random events that can pop up while playing through the questline of a few different campaigns.

The game is slow, bad luck can ruin a run. But otherwise you've got a game you can play with your friends online, locally or even enjoy alone.
Each run will feel different, especially now that they've added so much content. There's multiple ways to play every class, mix that with coming across an gun and your blacksmith that used to be a tank is now the top damage dealer. Find a legendary glave? Your minstrel support is now a hard hitting melee.

The difficulty in this game used to be a huge turn off, I personally HATE really time sensitive games. Especially when RNG can slow you down in games like this. But thankfully you can change the difficulty. It wont be time sensitive where you cant waste time but you've BASICALLY got all the time you'll need. It's a very nice addition from when I first started playing this.

On top of that, there's some roguelike unlocks. I personally wish the classes were easier to get because when you mostly play with friends you dont want to go achievement hunting due to how long a campaign can take to play with others. I do like unlocking random events, visit structures, items, classes, cosmetics over time but the classes feel a little too important and add such great variety to the game to hide behind achievements and meta progression.
Now on meta progression, you dont really need the unlocks, it's just variety. Side grades to what exists. Maybe some of them could be better than what's in the game from the start due to some stats being better than others but i've beaten the game without any of them on a few campaigns. Outside of that there are some buildings that do make the game easier. But you'll get those unlocked before you have enough of a grip on the game to really win.

Great game, fun with friends. Looking forward to the 2nd game.

The random loot system is probably on tier with Diablo, something that is strange to say but true.

The mild humour is both adorable, immersive and bonding with your Co-Op partners.

The lore store is quite possibly the best unlock system I have ever seen in a game. Play more, earn more lore, then choose to add various things to the maps, even those already started.

Spend lore on either more weapon and armour drops, cosmetic items for characters, random events and so much more.

NO microtransactions.

Limited DLC which only one person in the party has to own.

Awesome demi boss fights, scourges.

Awesome final boss fights which can punish you dearly for hours of work.

A fully custom economy system, how many lives you get and how the economy inflates.

Endless possibilities for character builds.

Funny and challenging enemy types within all encounters and dungeons.

Graphically incredible.

So much polish it will burn yout retinas.

WAND OF DEATH.

Cons,

The sequel isn't out until 2023.

This game is outstanding, if you have no friends, not a problem, play with three who are all you.

Take a bow guys, better than 99% of AAA releases, so much time and content on offer.

Honestly for the money you cannot beat the amount of content that you can get out of it. Awesome game to play Solo or with a friend (up to 2 others). Replaying the different story modes adds additional time enjoying the game.

With there being a ""Lore Store"" which you get ""Lore"" as you progress through the game, you can then use this to unlock encounters, weapons, armor and cosmetics that change how your next play through will feel.

Honestly recommend this game to any one looking for something to play alone or with a buddy. The community is great and will answer any questions or strategy ideas you may have.

One thing that really sticks with me in these RPG/Roguelikes is the ability to experience various events and encounters. It sort of has a D&D feel but instead of one character you manage a 3-man crew, there is no carry weight so you can hoard as much loot as you want, the combat uses a sort of token system, and when a character dies you have the option to revive with one of your characters or to use a Life token, giving the game a better sense of progression without robbing you of your hard work.

I find there to be an enjoyable degree of content that keeps the player from feeling a sense of repetitiveness, although occasionally some events do repeat themselves. There is a wide range of options for adventuring between raiding dungeons and taking bounties against higher tier enemies. The Chaos meter adds a bit of extra challenge and reward by making targets stronger but also increasing the rewards after each combat session. Combat is fairly straight forward utilizing Focus Tokens to help with skill checks and land criticals.

My favorite concept is the fact that any class can utilize any weapon, and that each weapon has it's own set of abilities. Some are base attacks, while others have unique abilities that have various additional effects. Some items like amulets and armor also possess immunities to certain debuffs. Consumables consist of scrolls and herbs, with some unique items that have specific functions.

Overall I ended up enjoying For The King more than I was anticipating. I will be putting more hours in and eventually updating this review with some opinions on the end game. 9/10",1660689330,1660689330,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: What a champ, free cosmetic DLC's, only pay for content DLC's.  <- Perfection.

It can be difficult, the RNG can be brutal, but it can also be surprising, each play-through is different enough from the last to keep you replaying, and as you discover more characters and stuff in game, you earn lore books to add even more to the board.

There's a lot of crying about how a lot of enemies have different rules to the players, they can AOE debuff for example... Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it keeps you on your toes. You can completely negate certain debuffs by finding and equipping armour that gives you immunities to it, which means you have to be wise about how you spend your cash so later on should you find that 'perfect item' in a random vendor, you can get it, if it doesn't drop from a boss first.
Should someone else get the cash or the item, well, you can help your teammates by throwing them that shiny sword, armour or cash at them, to work together to complete the game and teamwork goes beyond material gifts. For example: If someone has poison immunity, let them go first through the poison bog to dissipate the poison for you.
Tactically, it's quite in-depth.

That being said even on the easiest difficulty it's still quite difficult if you don't prepare properly. Highly replayable as well as each of the campaigns have randomly generated maps so doing the same campaign multiple times is still quite fun. It goes on sale for about $6, and for that price i'd say it's very worthwhile. Pick up deluxe edition for the extra couple bucks as well as the items, two classes, and new campaign are worth the very tiny amount of extra money, about $1.50 on sale.

You have a wide range of classes to choose from which you can unlock as you play the game, although most of the classes don't seem particularly well balanced. Basically you're almost always going to be playing characters who have a high speed stat as they go first in combat, while those with lower speed only end up hindering you. Your damage isn't based on your class either, it's based on the weapon you're using. Only your stats which can help with accuracy and with getting better luck in the various random events, starting items, and passive skills are affected by your class, but ultimately speed reigns supreme which is a bit unfortunate. Plus nearly all of the classes play the game. There's no real difference between a strength-based character and an intellect-based character since all skills your characters have are based off the weapon you're using. A strength character could use an intellect weapon if they wanted to although they'd have very low accuracy with it. It would be nice if each class had some innate skills they could use regardless of their weapon (some like herbalist which has party heal do but its one of very few) rather than random passives that don't really mean too much. For example: The Blacksmith class being able to use a stun against an enemy no matter what weapon he's using as long as it's strength-based rather than it being complete rng what skills he'll get. I also wish that when you leveled up you could maybe get skill points to spend into extra health or damage or something instead of it just being a flat boost for all of your stats. That being said, I still do like skills being based off of weapons as it keeps things fresh as you play the game and replace your gear, I just wish it was a bit more complex.

The enemies and dungeons are well varied, and while the combat is very simply designed it's still quite fun and easily accessible for anyone unlike some other RPGs such as Divinity Original Sin (which is also a great turn-based RPG). It's rather neat that many enemies have special abilities like being able to destroy your items, steal money, or cause your character to flee combat. This however, sometimes can cause fights that are more difficult than they should be when you get an enemy that can destroy your gear, another that will steal your gold and flee with it, AND one that will do massive damage to your party, possibly killing someone all in the same fight.

The campaigns are all fairly enjoyable. The story is generic, but that's fine for a game like this. Each campaign has its own unique theme and mechanics, and combined with the random generation allows you to play multiple runs of the same maps and still experience something new, or at least, different. On top of being able to purchase new encounters on the map as you play, there's enough here to keep you entertained for a while. There's even an endless mode that's nothing but combat if that suits your fancy.

The balancing is a little off sometimes. I've mentioned classes already, but the rng in your campaigns can really screw you over as well. Entire runs can end because you didn't get a good enough gear drop and now you have outdated weapons and are unable to obtain new ones since you've cleared what dungeons you could and towns don't stock anything useful to you. Some status effects can completely cripple your run as well by nuking your stats or destroying good equipment you have. For the most part this hasn't been a problem for me, but it does happen on occasion, so make sure you keep backup gear with you instead of immediately selling it.

Overall, while not my favorite turn-based game it comes in a close second. It's a lot more fun to play with friends but still an enjoyable solo experience. I rate it an 85/100 due to it's cheap price tag and simple but enjoyable fun that provides a good challenge that isn't too bs... a fair amount of the time anyways. Points are deducted for your runs being heavily dictated by good rng and the necessity to grind at times in order to prepare for later parts of a campaign, and while for me this was only a problem some of the time I can very well see it being a lot more problematic for others depending on your luck. They are making a second For The King game, so it'll be exciting to see what they do with that when it comes out.",1660443984,1660443984,True,11,0,0.638821423053741455,0,True,False,False

You may ask how it punishes the player? Well, this game has ""Timeline"" mechanic meaning that every day, the chaos will rise in the world which will grant additional 10 % hp to monsters. To get rid of chaos player must take bounty from a city. Sounds easy? Not quite, it is 1 bounty per city and so player must find new city that can give another chaos bounty OR if you are lucky enough you can stumble upon Chaos camp somewhere in the game. (Timeline can not be turned off/disabled)
Besides the chaos there are also other disasters, e.g Scourge 

Speaking of Scourge the timeline shows up weird icon that is slowly moving towards the player however there is no INFO about that icon what it is or what it will do, then a bit later game announces that ""SCOURGE"" is coming - ""You have to deal with it fast before it appears in the WORLD"", so i start to panic and looking where it is around explored area BUT nothing, until it actually appears and guess what it appears in uncharted area. Yeah great design.

This so called scourge is leprechaun and he is lvl 6 that is 2 levels above the player. I decided to give a try bit later and get rid of this scourge, brought entire party and we start combat however after few of his turns he STOLE all my GOLD from one character and fled the combat afterwards, that rose bit of frustration since gold is crucial in this game. I then thought ""fine"" i'll come back later and get that gold back.

Now, the problem is that i need to lvl up to 6 with entire party BUT all other enemies are also 2 lvl above the player and its not single enemy lvl 6 it is entire party of lvl 6. Pretty cool huh? Not only those enemies have a LOT more HP but also deal 2/3 damage to one of my characters - nearly instant kill.

It is nice that there are enemies that randomly spawn in the world however the rate they are spawning is insane, it is because the world is made like a maze and there is no free path to go, usually blocked by enemy. Often when player sets a path to one of characters and as soon as the character steps foot in next hex enemy spawns onto and sometimes there is no other option as ""Defend"" that means combat and since player controls each character individually, he/she must fight alone and again the enemy is two levels above the player.

Moved entire party to closest city healed them then set next destination and as soon as one of characters stepped out of city enemy spawned onto. Whats this? You just spent gold to heal? Nah, you will have to do it again.

Remember i mentioned leprechaun? That was only slight tilt for me, i had no idea what will happen next.
Then there are enemies that steal from the player not only it is gold but also consumables from inventory. And no killing the enemy who stole from you wont return stolen items or gold - they are GONE for GOOD.

For some reason even though I took entire party to start combat only 1 character was in. He was my tank guy, quite slow too for combat. He had to kill Acid Slime, little did i know that this slime applied ACID which results destroying random item. It destroyed two equiped items (ring+boots) and weapon+shield from inventory. Seriously such a fucking dumb mechanic?

Oh yeah, debuffs from enemies... Well, a really bad way to make this mechanic without getting rid of debuffs after short period of time. What i mean is enemy applies poison debuff which results in reducing overall characters stats BUT even combat is done the poison still persists and game does not show for HOW long poison will reduce my stats no fcking indication. Normally, in other games when something was applied to character it will wear off by itself (e.g. divinity II). BUT nah i guess devs want you to spend gold in order to get rid of it and again just by wasting time getting from point A to point B across the map to closest city so you can activate even more CHAOS IN THE WORLD.

My quest ended at the King's Maze fighting Undead Bisontaur, my party didnt had a chance seeing how AI perfectly rolled every hit without ever missing rolls. And at the same time interrupts my attacks. Im pretty sure that the poison was the main reason why i lost because that lowered chance to hit enemies, however that wouldn't be the case if PARTY HEAL could remove THAT DEBUFF.

So yeah, there is difference between game being [b]difficult[/b] and game being [b]unbalanced[/b].

Looting:  Personally, I enjoy looting in games and I feel that in order to make a game feel personal, you have to give a lot of customization options.  For The King does just that by allowing plenty of weaponry/armor/clothing character items and I was able to make all of my playthroughs an enjoyable experience. 

Adventure:  The adventuring aspect of the game was enticing from the start and with each new playthrough, more items became unlocked using a Lore (in-game currency system) and I had a better chance at progressing further into the game/campaign.  Admittedly, after over 100 hours of gameplay, I think it is safe to say that playing the same campaign was feeling slightly repetitive, but I took that as a chance to try different character sets/builds as a way to spice up the gameplay.

All in all, it's a great game! Definitely fun to play with a couple of friends and even solo.  I can't wait until the full game is released, along with more content.  Keep it up, but more importantly: hurry up, IronOak!

Speaking of teams, man is it fun to play with friends. The only thing you can't do is cast guiding bolt on your friends, which is a shame. It's got tons of story options, every run is randomized, and it really pushes you to play as a team. 

The gameplay is relatively simple. You have encounters, events, and you fight through a series of bosses. There's a difficulty level for everyone, and you can even make a custom one if you need to (no shame, honestly). I've had a lot of fun with this game, and I'll continue to for longer.

It felt like the type of games I enjoy where you are forced to succeed with a limited number of resources.  However, as I continued I found some aspects quite frustrating.

The game forces you to control and move characters around the map individually, I had thought this would lead to an interesting dynamic of splitting the group to get more resources vs staying together for a combat advantage.  In practice since health is such a premium resource I found that the cost in health for fighting things individually was never worth the tradeoff.  If I could keep my party together as a unit I would in a heartbeat as it would remove a 2/3rds of the clicking and time on the world map.  Eventually I chalked this up as an annoying UI decision that enabled multi-player control of individual characters.

The thing that made me put the game down was enemy ambushes.  Typically you can see enemies on the map and any unit within 2-3 hexes will be included in combat.  You can position your units to help on tough fights or try to split things up.  However when you are ambushed (which happens rarely but seemingly completely randomly) it will pull the one character into combat with the enemy and no help for other units standing nearby.  You better hope that it's a good matchup and not your physical tank against a magic enemy that will shred him in 2 attacks or so.  Things like this that seem to have no indications and no counterplay can just kill your characters and really soured what I felt was an otherwise interesting strategy game.

That being said if you have a couple buddies and you're looking for something to play, this is a quirky little co-op tactical turn-based RPG that y'all can kill some time in pretty easily. 

I'm not going to lie, I don't really remember what difficulty settings we played on, but it felt like it was decently tuned if maybe a little harsh. You can get majorly screwed over by RNG in this game, straight up, and while it's funny from time to time you *might* find yourselves a bit frustrated at times. On the flip side it's got a few tiny moments where everything is coming up aces and you're in tune with your co-op partners and the combat can feel pretty good.

The biggest problem is that you're really going to run out of game pretty quickly here unless you *really* enjoy essentially the same game over and over again as different classes. Once you've basically got everything figured out the novelty wears off, at least in my opinion. 

I've never once endeavored to play this game in single player mode, it's probably fine? I could not imagine it gripping me without having people to talk to and cooperate with.

Individual turn-based actions and group combat turn based actions.
Hexagonal world map movement, which is great for overworld movement
Dungeons are directional and automated, so you only deal with the encounters and not the movement.

A small array of things available to start with, though increases as you locate more ‘Lore’ to purchase things from more character types to items and encounters, through to cosmetics.

You will need to play several times through before you start getting used to the intricacies of the game, this is not a bad thing, as even on easy, it is challenging.

Most DLC’s are free

Rolls are not fair, probability is always against you. The game feels awesome until you get to a point where you have like 95 strength, is 2 hours deep into your campaign and then completely fail a roll with a 5-roll weapon that, according to probability, is only supposed to fail all 5 tests 0.25% of the time. You think to yourself ""hmm that's fair, 95% per roll is not the same as 100%. My rolls will fail every now and then"". Then you get curious, decide to test it out and reload the game just for that purpose, believing you won't see such an occurrence again so easily. Nope, you try the same roll 10 more times and it fails in 4 of those. That's not 0.25% chance. It COULD be, but try this type of thing enough and you'll see the probabilities don't match what's on screen. The numbers just don't feel right, what you see is NOT what you get. That creates a lingering feeling that difficulty feels unfair. The ""challenge"" can't be countered because it's embedded in almost every action the game offers you. If the game decides it's time for you to have a full battle of unlucky rolls that will cost you hours of gameplay, that's what's going to happen. Doesn't matter what you do against it. That's not to mention some other utterly weird decisions by the devs — I still don't get why you need to roll dice in order to move your characters on the map, it just makes the game slow down to a drag and feel frustrating. The UI is horrible and looks super lazy. Animations take way more time than needed, even when you speed them up. Runs feel largely the same every time, there's little variation in what happens. You unlock tons of stuff in the Lore Store only for those items to never show up in any of your runs. There's lots of potential here, but the lazy execution from devs cutting corners unnecessarily hera and there just throws me off completely.

 There is hardly any tactics involved in building your character, as often you just have to decide gear based on damage numbers. While that is not bad itself, the fact that your skills are determined by the weapon, whereas many skills simply have no viable late-game weapon, means that there is virtually no variety whatsoever in your build choice. 
 As for the enemies, most enemies either have extremely unfun gimmicks such as avoiding anything that wasn't blessed by perfect RNG, or have AOE-damage and AOE-debuffs. Also, the prior problem with skills kinda gets negated by enemies, since most enemies are straight immune to whatever status effect you can apply, even if that basically leaves tactless attacking as your only option.

I suppose it could be called that if you count incredibly terrible RNG as difficulty. The game itself is not difficult, it is a standard dungeon crawl for the most part, and it's not even that long in any of the campaigns. However, what artificially lengthens the time you play this game is that you live and die by rolls that are plainly stacked against you. You can play as good as you are able, you can make all the right decisions, you can even have the best gear. But they will not save you from an enemy that rolls good, (and they roll better than you can ever hope to), has better abilities than you, and has far more armor and damage than you could ever hope to come close to achieving. 

There are other things that add to this game being so much less than it could've been. All the characters you can unlock with in game currency (Lore Points), or random encounters, are all worse than the ones you start out with. Some have good gimmicks but that is all. Every seasoned player will tell you that the optimal party consists of the 4 beginning classes. Some of the best items in this game are the ones that you will find early on. As the higher tier items trade accuracy for damage, and even maxing out the stat required to effectively wield it will have you hitting less than half of the time. Monsters are always faster than you, at every level, the only exception to this is the Hunter sometimes. Combine this with the fact that they do absurd amounts of damage, have a tendency to dogpile a single character, and you can occasionally see one of your party members die before anyone of you has gone. The game is also heavily biased towards playing with multiple people, as singleplayer controlling 3 characters gets very frustrating and while i have no way to verify this, i always seem to have the worse luck when selecting singleplayer as an option. 

Another horrible thing about this game is the abilities. Inherent to characters, gained from items, and attacks derived from items themselves. Inherent abilities are incredibly unreliable, and have a tendency to proc when they are the least useful, and for the ones that proc on attacks only do so on perfect rolls. The attacks gained from items are middling with either a high number of rolls to achieve full effect, or low damage otherwise. For some reason this game seems to hate it when players use defensive abilities but loves it when the enemy does. Commonly you'll see enemies with full party buffs that have very few rolls, while you as a player require double the amount of rolls and only targeting a single player. There are exceptions of course, but they're very few in number.

This game could've been spectacular, as the core mechanics of the game are very appealing on the surface. As it stands the game styles itself as ""difficult"" but the most difficult thing about it is finding people who can stomach playing it. This game is more of a loaded dice rolling simulator than a dungeon crawler.",1655094297,1655094297,False,6,1,0.518248200416564941,0,True,False,False

I only had one run beat the final boss on Journeyman, which is the ""normal"" difficulty, on the default campaign. It required a lot of luck for the perfect weapon setup, but once we figured out how to out-cheese him, we got there. Technically you're supposed to die to him, so being able to beat him with a bit of strategy and a lot of luck is nice.

The game can get really difficult, because its definitely unforgiving. A missed roll at the right time can send your run on a doom spiral, but IMO thats fine. A fun loss is way better than a boring win.

My biggest criticism is that the DLC works in a weird way. If you buy it, it injects *all* of the monsters into the normal game, even outside of the DLC campaign. Theyre a significant difficulty jump, which can lead to some unfair feeling situations. It'd be a lot less frustrating if you could just toggle whether or not you want to see dlc items/monsters, but unfortunately that's not the case.",1654627112,1654627112,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Basically, the game is based on RNG to a fault, and you can play with 3 characters, either solo or multiplayer and not doing so puts you at a disadvantage. At higher difficulties it seems you're forced to use meta combos and weapons instead of what can be more enjoyable, funny or cool, as getting later into the game basically denies you all forms of usability in weapons that aren't just 'blahh I do damage, blahh I have 1 check and deal pierce damage'. The game is objectively unfair as the enemies you fight can do things that are impossible for your character to do, and hit RNG checks that are statistically impossible for you aswell. Level ramp up feels imbalanced as later on its not uncommon to be dealt half of your health just because Mr. rock man can consistently hit all 5 checks on a heavy attack that with max probability you couldn't dream of getting more than 2. Shop prices ramp up aswell, but gold ramps up decently to compensate but feels unnecessary.

These seem like alot of complaints, but I do find the game genuinely enjoyable as my review status shows, and in the grand scheme of this game its not that much, just minor annoyances viewed through a microscope just to see the problem and overall I would recommend you play this, just try to find a couple friends willing to join as it makes it so much more enjoyable.

1) Git good, which means understand the min/ max strategies, best armor/ weapons, worst enemies, etc.  The games randomness frequently overwhelms your control, but your control is mostly defined by your classes.  The designers did a good job of making every class viable (in theory), but really reward you when you select an appropriate mix of primary stats (going with Intelligence + Awareness + Strength, for example, allows you to almost always find a use for new equipment/weapons, while going all Hunters / Awareness means you compete amongst yourselves for weapons and fail int/str checks).  From there it's all about learning which enemies to avoid, since the wiki is only half baked.

2) Lore store is basically locked content that helps you.  So for a game designed to be hard when you first start out, they actually just gate you via the lore store.  You should unlock all encounters ASAP.  Unfortunately, the game doesn't tell you how to unlock them all, and they don't all match up with achievements, so you have to look that stuff up on the wiki.  Also how to best grind lore (play on master and defeat the first chaos camp, then quit before ending your turn to repeat it endlessly) so that you can pay for the unlock once revealed.

In the end, the story is meh, there are no cutscenes and it is just playing out the repetitive mechanics of the game.  The favored strategy for beating the hardest difficulty is hoping to get the right weapons to enact a cheese (group reset or group rush), because the game itself so often cheeses you to your death.  So it's tactical fun progression offering medium depth, but nothing deeper.  I've enjoyed unlocking it all solo, but it's more frustrating than fun with friends.  Get it if you can live with unlocking everything except for beating the hardest difficulty.",1654043652,1654043652,True,2,0,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,False

I have been playing this game since release and it has been fun to watch it grow (many more hours on this game off of Steam). Prepare for hours of funny, exciting and challenging moments.

I also really appreciate how descriptive the game is and the abundance of QoL features that makes using the UI extremely easy and fast. (Scroll to the bottom for my only negative opinion of this game but don't worry its not game breaking)

This game is a perfect combination of rogue like, co-op, turn based, table top, RPG and open world. 

 Every play through will be different. The rogue-like style to this game adds so much replay value to it. Topped off with the addition of the Lore Store, a place where you can unlock then buy new equipment, in world encounters, locations, classes and more for use on your next journey. 

Each campaign and game mode offers a great variety of obstacles that will make you adapt. From dungeon crawling, land and sea battles, survival in winter lands and more. There are also affordable DLC's that are great!

The combat and levelling system is pretty standard and simple but also in depth enough to keep you interested. There are lots of weapons, equipment and clothing to make use of. 

My only problem with this game that with the new addition of the ""Lost Civilization"" DLC there are new enemies that have been added to the game that you will come across in your campaigns. While this shouldn't be a problem, it seems as if the new enemies weren't properly balanced or scaled in terms of strength.",1653935257,1653935257,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The below review is still accurate, although I did play coop. We found a way to abuse saves, this way we can retry when we are super unlucky, making the game fun. I encourage you to cheat.
------------------

(This review is mainly meant for devs to improve the game)
This review is spoiler free, though I will talk about some game mechanics.

The game is ridiculously unfair. Lets go step by step together to see why it is so.

First, ailements (burning, frozen, etc):
- Shocked basicaly means my character (most often my entire team) cannot do anything for multiple rounds, since not doing perfect barely does any damage and no effects. Shocked needs to be nerfed heavily, wether by making it last only a round (still plenty strong) or changing it so its not guarantheed to ""shock"" you, 50% chance could be alright.
- The fact that ailements are temporary is NOT explained anywhere or not obvious enough. I lose a couple of my first runs because I kept paying to remove poison for example.

Second, curses:
- All of them have the same issue, they are permanent unless you pay to remove them. But then you have to walk all the way back to a town (or have one of the rare items which can remove curse). The issue here is, it is very commun to get cursed, walk all the way back to town to remove it and then get in an encounter just outside town and be cursed again. Ok, so what do I propose to make curses more interesting and less rage inducing? Make them temporary, its that simple. Curses got annoying and  game breaking to the point where the only way forward was to stop curing them. I ended up with 6 curses on my blacksmith, luckily for me none of these was affecting his strength.

Third, the lore store:
- Most of the items you can purchase are pretty meh.. like I wouldn't even want them in my game even if they were free to get. So why would I pay for them at all? Point is, I won't, but thats very disappointing to see.
- The 'Yes' and 'No' buttons are reversed when buying. It is ALWAYS 'Yes' then 'No', never the opposite. This small difference from.. well every game, application and everything that exists, made me purchase something I didn't want by accident.
- There should be something to tell me or at least give me a hint of how to unlock something in the Lore store. I really want to unlock more classes (hoping they are good enough to make the game playable), but I have absolutly no clue how. I will have to google it.

Forth, monsters:
- They do an excessive amount of damage, and I haven't even tried the other difficulties yet. A normal monster I encounter, when he is alone too, shouldn't be able to kill one of my characters in a single turn (from full health) yet it happened, multiple times. And yes, I was the same level or above as he. Theres also that monster (no spoiler) which did 50 damage to all members of my team + status ailement in a single turn and did it pretty much every second turn. Enough example, the excessive amount of damage enemies do, and I mean all of them from start to finish, are about 25-50% too high, depending on the monster. Yes that much. Lets remember here I am talking of easy mode, it should be clearable by a child after a couple tried (10-20 maybe), but here I am planning each of my move and calculating the odds of everything trying to min max the game and still getting crushed by a random bat in the forest. If this game is meant to be this impossibly hard on easy mode, well this is a bad game design, because it really limits who can and cannot play this game, which is a terrible shame.

- Enemy ambushing is terrible. When your only option is to Defend and you were walking back to town to heal, what are your options now? Well die of course. I am not saying enemy ambuses shouldn't exist, but there should be an option to attempt an escape at least. Even if it has no probability, it will at least offer the possibility to spend focus on a possible escape and save that character from dying. Dying by ambushes is common because it most often seem to happen when your character is not quite close enough to your other characters so he fights alone.

The last boss:
Well I was excepting harder seeing how the whole game was way too hard. BUT you absolutly need to modify him. Why? Well it is not very fun to watch him take 8 turns in a row, but I can do a single action. Yes 8 turns in a row. Thats my personnal record. 

Life steal:
- Another thing is you shouldn't have (ever) attacks heal for the same amount it did in damage, specially since it ignores armor. Monsters healing mid battle is incredibly powerful, I would gladly kill one of my characters to have a weapon with such abilities. Enemies with said ability are amongst the hardest since you cannot attack them first (too tank because of their healing), so they destroy you while you try to clear the other mobs. Even when they are alone, they are a challenge if you do not always get perfect rolls to kill them quickly. It should heal at most for 50% of damage dealt. Though, it the monsters damage are nerf (has mentionned above), life steal could very well be in a perfect spot.

0%:
- Once I had 93%, 7% and 0% odds. 93% being the odss of a perfect roll and 0% of a critical fail roll. And yes, I did get a critical fail roll at 0%. If it was 1%, sure thats very bad luck, but 0%? Thats plain magic. This NEEDS to be fixed.

Coop:
- I haven't personnaly played the coop and I don't think I want to. Why? Well the game is WAY too hard as is, if we were to split just a tiny bit (you know since every player wants to do his thing and not just follow Player 1 right?) we would get obliterated even within the first or second area. This wouldn't so much a problem (though could still be) if the game difficulty is readjusted with the changes above, but mainly reducing enemy damage. As the game is right now, it is NOT a coop game, it is a game where you get to do the clicks the Player 1 wants, because otherwise you lose.

Loot:
- I do realize the game just came out so I expect for divers loot to be added, but I thought it mention it anyway. There isn't much loot variety. I ended up with the same helm of my three heroes and sold 3 more of the same helm. There is a bigger variety for weapons however which is good.

Breaking weapons:
- I did not use them once, why? Well, most of those I got weren't better than my regular weapons, which makes me wonder why they aren't better? But some of them are indeed interesting. The main issue with them is, the game doesn't explain what happens when they break mid fight, does it make your character unable to fight for the remaining of the battle? If it does, I am never using them. If it doesn't, it should be made more obvious.

Ending:
- THIS SECTION HAS A MINOR SPOILER, when you see the heroes statues, it really feels weird that they do not represent your heroes at all. They gear is different, they appearance is different, everything is except gender and class. This is obviously not major BUT it did ruin my joy of finishing a game because I was focused on thinking of how inaccurate the statues were.

Basicaly, it is a game with a good concept. But it needs some rebalancing to be enjoyable. I played 14.7 hours and I cannot say I enjoyed most of it. A major part of it was raging on how inbalanced and unfair the game is. With the current game balance, I cannot recommand this game. HOWEVER, if future patches fix said issues, I will modify my review and probably recommand the game.",1524727051,1652930682,False,4,0,0.49994206428527832,1,True,False,False

For the King is a turn based dungeon crawler, you fight monsters, complete quests and collect loot. 
This game is VERY team based and literally requires three players to complete, learned that the hard way. 

It's slow paced but addictive, feels like playing a board game or dungeons and dragons so slow is not a bad thing here but allows you to relax and build yourself and your team mates for your best chance at survival. Bring friends or play solo so you can control all players.
Normally I'm bored of any new game after the 2 hour mark during a session but this one 3 hours can pass easy before you even realize. Shows this game has staying power and is just a fun rewarding time that teaches you teamwork. 

Lots of game modes, unlocks for items, cosmetics and random spawns during the game.

Pros : 
- Nice graphics and animations
- Nice music
- Fun combat (most of the time)

Cons:
- Impossible to move your team as a team, except when on a boat
- When fighting multiple waves, you are not allowed to do anything between waves, like trasfering an item from one character to another.
- Too much RNG. When (non-weak) enemies start to focus on one of your characters, you can't do much. Protection and healing and not going to save the say.
-Visual effect showing which character is atcive is barely visible, especially in snow environments.

Now the game is difficult, I won't lie. At times that can be frustrating, especially if you've just spent the last 8 hours or so getting to a certain point before dying/losing. But the game does not take it self too seriously, it's full of silly gimmicks and small lines of dialogue that make you naturally want to take it less serious as well reducing the impact of losing. And more importantly it makes you think and re-strategize. It's fun to find new team builds that can ""cheese"" the game in order for you to win. 

It is also much more enjoyable playing with other people. It's great to sit down with a couple of your close friends and just relax playing some FTK. But it still can be fun by yourself and shouldn't discourage you too much from buying it. As it's essentially the same, but your just playing 3 characters instead of one. Though gameplay can be a little awkward with just 2 players.

All of the adventures available in game are fun (Except for gold rush or whatever it's called) and change it up just enough to where you won't get tired of the same formula of game-play. And the cosmetics in the game are just generally silly and cost no actual money. The lore store is a fairly interesting way to make playing you next adventure different, or give you something else to work towards. For example trying to find a specific item you bought on the lore store because you know it will be helpful in fighting a certain boss. Or maybe collecting enough lore points to unlock new encounters, or a specific cosmetic you want. The same can be extended to the DLC, which is worth every penny.

That being said there are some downsides to this game. The first being how much time it takes and pacing. The game is slow paced, it takes hours to go through even a mildly successful run. Not to mention once you've lost, you've completely lost and have to start over. As I stated earlier, the game is hard. But there is a save system so you don't have to sit down for several hours at a time to play, you can split you game up into several 1-2 hour days. And, most of the time you will have gained lore from a failed run and can use it to help you in the next run, giving you a sense of progress.

Another downside is that, at the end of the day, this game is based on luck. Just like any other video game based on RNG, sometimes you just lose. You can strategize all day, reduce the chance of something happening as much as you can, but the game usually prevents 100% guarantees. For example when you attack with a weapon it shows you your chance (%) of hitting a creature with it. And this percentage scales with a certain stat. Stats max out at 95 giving you at most a ~90-95% of hitting. Which is good, but not 100%. Now there are exceptions when it comes to using focus, but yet again focus is a limited resource that you  can only get back through in game money, or more random chance. With that all being said, the random chance in this game is actually fairly balanced and can give it a fun twist, especially when luck works out in your favor. But, if you are someone who seeks out skill based games to avoid RNG, then maybe this game isn't for you.

TLDR:
For The King is a great game that will entertain you for hours on end, especially if you have two friends to play with, and if you don't mind relying on a little bit of luck. It can be frustrating and slow at times, but it gives you a sense of progress and let's you discover new and fun ways to try and beat it each time.

Evidently you have to be a masochist to actually enjoy this game. Every attack you make fails while the enemy gets perfect hits every time.  The few times you actually do get an attack the enemy blocks it. You have as much health as the enemy, but no where near the hit potential they do. It's ridiculous.

I played through it about 10 times all last roughly 10 mins a piece tops. The only thing you can actually kill are the wolf/lions? Cant really tell what it is. However, they are the only animals alone and when you go 3 on 1 you might get 2 attacks in before he has half your team almost dead. If he has any other support you will just out right die. Not because of bad choices you made. However, it's because while the game tells you that every pip is a 75%+ chance of success it's more akin to a 10% chance of success. Considering over 90% of the pips will fail out right. Only way to off set this is by using focus on every strike. However, each character only has 3 focus points so attempt to ""manage"" this is impossible just use them all then camp. Hopefully you get enough gold to go into town every other turn and mediate you will never have the focus needed to kill the next enemy. 

Forget using decent weapons that they give either. Because the very first attempt you 1 pip of 85% success right will fail and the weapon will instantly break making it impossible to actually use and see how effective it is. 

My suggest, buy a bat (much cheaper) and beat yourself up. Much more fun then this mess of a game. IMO",1651282579,1651282579,False,0,0,0.415094316005706787,0,True,False,False

If you like rng (kinda dice roll) adventures and tabletop style gaming this is an easy recommend.

Disclaimers so people know though:

+Completing a campaign can literally take 6 hours. 4 if playing with people who are experienced. If playing with others you really need to make sure you have a serious amount of time free. People will get annoyed if you want to start a campaign with only an hour free and then bounce.

+Some people enjoy this game solo but on the official discord voice chatting with others is where the game shines. If social interactions with new people generally give you anxiety then you may want to pass.

+There are quite linear optimal ways to play. So if you want to be creative and experiment with lots of different builds this isn't really that type of game. You pick a class and you will generally pursue your primary stat/gear 9/10 times.",1651067085,1651067085,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can also collect gear and unlockable tokens for future runs. Once you're defeated, you can spend your tokens to unlock new events on the map, items and more - making future runs more in your party's favour.

I got it on sale and no regrets. Would definitely recommend. There's a number of campaigns with the base game, all with varied difficulty modes.

You win fights, take some damage, get some stuff, cool. After leveling up a couple times and going to the next area, things get really frustrating.

As turns go on, one mechanic is that certain enemies will spawn that cause negative effects. To clear this, you have to go to where they are and beat them. One of these makes it so that item drops can just get stolen. And where these spawn is a bit random. So, having a mini-boss that steals my items from across the map is really, really frustrating. By the time you get to and clear the first one, the second one spawns (in my case, it just spawns 3 ghosts after each fight that give nothing, so you just take more damage after a fight at best).

A lot of enemy mechanics also get really frustrating. I.e.: Enemy confuses you ENTIRE TEAM, making you lose control. So, 2 characters flee, leaving a single character to do a random attack and get hit by 3 enemies. There is also a mechanic called ""focus"" that lets you guarantee a single success (an action can require multiple successes to get a perfect roll). However, a common ability enemies have is to just drain all focus from a character. Since many abilities REQUIRE perfect rolls (for armor ignore, igniting enemies, splash damage, etc.), giving a mechanic to overcome RNG a bit only for an enemy to block access to it is really frustrating.

Overall, if you enjoy really difficult situations that you have little to no control over, this can be a fun game. It takes too much control away from me for my preference, however.",1650697846,1650697846,False,61,9,0.547976553440093994,0,True,False,False

The systems are not very complex unfortunately: your main goal is to max 1 stat on any character so they can exceed at whatever their job is (all combat and non-combat actions are determined by dice rolls and the respective stat).

In order to keep you engaged it has to play with breadth rather than depth, but so far it has done a great job at that, and if I didn't have such an irrational fear of ""finishing"" games, I'd have played it a lot more already.

After replaying in 2022:

It still has horrific RNG that entirely favors the AI. Enemies always go first, sometimes attacking twice or three times before your entire team makes a single turn. Enemies barely, if ever fail rolls. You fail rolls every other roll. I'd say half of the enemies have a one roll ability that always lands. You have around 3-4 rolls, of which 2 or 3 inevitably fail and cause you to do 2 damage. Even after wandering around the map, getting every person good gear and weapons, I fail to get past the glittering mines. It's wave after wave of impossible enemies while even with godsbeard flowing from my bags, I cannot survive. 

It's sad because the game is actually fun. But when progression actually matters, having RNG decide whether or not you repeat 3 hours of grinding over again is so boring and you'll most likely quit instead of playing another run. This is especially true considering the loot is all generic and doesn't do much for your stats. There's no legendary items that can give you the upper hand or interesting builds, it's a bunch of low tier stat sticks that you throw on your guys and hope to god it has some improvement on the tremendously shit gameplay you've been experiencing. Consumables are laughably weak and are walled off behind upgrading some obscenely expensive pipe. 

TL;DR: STAY AWAY IF YOU DO NOT LIKE RNG BASED GAMES. The game is entirely RNG, there is no ""skill.""",1530295585,1645409276,False,2,1,0.320573300123214722,0,True,False,False

I enjoy For The King's game mechanics. I like exploring the beautiful maps, leveling up, gathering loot, and completing the quests. I think this style of game has a lot of potential for other kinds of games within it (e.g. a Talisman style PvP mode).

I enjoy playing rogue like games and I also play a lot of complex board games, so For The King is really a perfect mix of the two.

That being said, the biggest issue and flaw is the difficulty scaling of this game. I play with an experienced group of friends, and we struggled to barely beat the first adventure on the easiest difficulty.

The game offers a 3 player co-op functionality, but this proves quite problematic if you want to play the Normal or Hard difficulties. The game's combination of timer mechanic, monster scaling with you, and economy inflation mean you can't ♥♥♥♥ around. You have to optimize every move. You essentially need to min-maxing every choice if you want to have a chance to win.

So when you're playing with 3 or even 2 players on any difficulty above easy, it's really not fun when you realize you need to tightly coordinate your moves to have a chance to win. It takes away your agency completely. This tells me the game was really designed for single player, and multiplayer was just tacked on. If anything, the difficulty scaling should be lowered if you are playing with 2 or 3 people, simply because your team won't always coordinate perfectly. And if your team is coordinating perfectly, you might as well be playing single player, because everyone's choices will be predetermined. This goes against each player controlling their own individual character--yes we should come together to fight the big bad, but each player is naturally going to want to spread out and explore on their own.

The map is quite beautiful and it begs to be explored. It's even funner when you can sail and discover islands, new continents, etc.. This exploration seems only possible on Easy mode. If you waste any time unnecessarily exploring, you'll likely get out scaled by the Chaos/Alignment/Scourge mechanic and lose the game. Why design such a beautiful map when we can't explore it?

On top of the timer mechanic, the game punishes you with the economy inflation mechanic. Buying basic healing items becomes prohibitively expensive in a short amount of time. Since healing is so precious, this discourages you from exploring, because it means you'll take damage that can't be easily healed.

What makes RPG/rogue like games enjoyable is the progression mechanic. As you level up, you get stronger and are able to take on more encounters/battles. Unfortunately, the monsters in this game level up with you (and will level up past you if you're too slow). Meaning you will always feel like battles are a struggle. This ruins any sense of progression, and feels like the game punishes you for even leveling up.

For The King dangles in front of you beautiful maps to explore, 3 player co-op, loot, leveling up, etc., but most of it you won't enjoy because you need to be consulting all the online guides to heavily optimize your turns to even have a chance of winning. This game feels more like Chess disguised as a medieval fantasy RPG.

I'd recommend the developers creating a more free form mode that lets players actually explore and be immersed in the world. At the very least, there should probably be more difficulties, like a Easy - Normal - Expert - Master - Legend, and then make easy/normal actually ""easier"".",1644379919,1644379919,False,1,0,0.448011487722396851,1,True,False,False

Missions are constantly bugging out, especially when the game crashes which makes progression in the storyline impossible. Sure free cosmetics are fun and all but when a bug from years ago is still present than it's just a cover up.
I really like the artstyle and what this game wants to be, but the problem just makes it a frustrating gaming experience.

I admit, the addition of the gladiator, arena events, and dual wield weapons were a great additions as well as wands and caster shields.

This game is fun, especially if you love board game and you have other friends to play with. But I cannot recommend it because ""RNG"" in this game is a shit.

When you first open the game, the game will tell you something like ""Don't think you can success in the first run"".
And YES! This is correct the game is very difficult. But most of the difficulty are come from the ""RNG"".

Most of the game play in this game:
Me: (95% successful rate) > OOOX > attack fail
Friend A: (95% successful rate) > X > attack fail
Friend B: (90% successful rate) > XOOX > attack fail

Enemy A: OOOOO > Perfect attack on whole team
Enemy B: OOOOO > Perfect attack with negative effect 
Enemy C: OOO > Stun whole team

In this game, nearly everything is base on ""roll a dice"" or ""probability"".
You roll a dice for your movement, action in combat, random encounter event, etc.
The game is trying to test your luck in everywhere, however ""RNG"" in this game is just a joke.

At first we thought we were just bad luck, but it was not.
The probability showing in the game is like a fake number, you probably fail most of the event and action with a very high successful rate (like fail an action with a 85% successful rate 3 times in a roll) .
But your enemy are not. They are like ""super lucky god-like"" enemy and can get a perfect movement in every attack.

There is no problem if they are really pure random. After ~30hours play time, I think the game is not.
I think the dev. just don't want to make a ""EASY GAME"" and add many ""random"" event to it. But I cannot accept that most of the difficulty is come from ""RNG"" and the ""RNG"" in this game is just a shit to fuck up your run.

The combat was okay.  But on the campaign map your characters can split up, and have different move values.  To keep them together in fights, which is what you want, you basically play follow-the-leader, but it usually results in waiting a turn or several for other characters to catch up.  It's sometimes convenient to go get loot to be able to separate.  But in general you want all of your guys grouped up and the individual movement I just don't like.

The quests aren't clear where you're supposed to go.  Where I got ""stuck"" it told me I had to enter a dungeon and hovered over a small town in the middle of the water.  Forced my whole party into the water and sailed all over the place and could never find it.  Went to the town, nothing, looked all around, nothing.  Went to the other side and kept on going.  Asked the forums later apparently it's just some small thing I missed that needs exploring to find or something.  Very unintuitive, and I am way too far ahead on the other side of the landmass now to go back. 

This whole game is predicated around a global timer, bad events happen every so often and you spend a good chunk of your time trying to avoid and push back those boundaries.  That means there's no going back, usually.  It means exploration has a steep cost.  I guess it adds pressure to a game that would otherwise be very easy if you could take your time.  But for the above reasons in my other paragraphs, it really doesn't fit well with the other mechanics.  Or those mechanics dont fit well with this time pressure mechanic.

GF and I have spent 80 hours in it, which is one of the longest in all the games we've played together so far.  That being said, you need a friend or two who's willing to play for 3-6 hours at a time, which is how long a run is.  There's online mode, but I don't believe strangers will stick for that long and have the same level of cooperation.

There are many things this game does well.  Particularly I'd mention that the classes are well balanced and every class has its pros and cons.  For example, you may find Hunter well-rounded and stronger than others at first, but then you realize Hunter doesn't really offer any supportive skills and bows don't tend to do high damage in late game.

There are things I wish this game does better, which I will list below.  Despite these, I definitely recommend this game.
- Lost Civilization Adventure DLC shouldn't be on top of the adventure list.  It's significantly harder than others.
- Sometimes things are not explained.  Such as buffs and debuffs, some of them are not intuitive: being wet removes immunities, being frozen takes more damage, diseases changes defense and can spread, etc.  Most butt-hurt thing is the Witchdoctor lowers the whole team's pipe levels without saying.  For a long time I thought pipe was bugged.
- I know this goes against the boardgame style design, but I wished gears had variances.  The same knife is always the same.  Would be nice to be a bit different for same knife each time I get it.  Maybe numbers are different, or attributes are different.
- After finishing all the adventures, I already know what happens in them, I have already tried all classes, there's not enough motivation spend so many hours to play again in higher difficulties.  There's an endless mode, but it feels extra disheartening for some reason, especially when you get cheesed to the death (sometimes fights are unfair).  The adventures, including the endless mode failed to make me expect that a new run will be much different.

I'd describe this game as Gen Z board game, mainly bc the overworld sports a board game aesthetic where players have to roll for movement. But unlike regular board games For the King has a plethora of locations and mini encounters for players to discover while exploring the map. Some of these mini encounters can also happen randomly, so player turns can end up being more interesting than expected.

While playing the game, you acquire Lore Books which can be used in the game's Lore Store to buy new character classes, special weapons, other mini locations, and more for future playthroughs. They're quite generous with giving out books too, so it doesn't feel like a grind to unlock things 

Character stats can be a fun thing to play with, and its always a good idea to have a well rounded team. One of the most fun stats that you can speck into is evasion. Towards the end of one of my playthroughs, I had a Hunter with 60 base evasion and a weapon that could increase that number to 95 (in other words, 95% chance to evade all attacks) practically making me untouchable.

Unlocked buildings and explore locations in the Lore Store can break and ruin the main campaign by overriding spawns for various important locations - like dungeons in Dungeon Crawl.

While this is a small issue in and of itself, when you've spent several hours playing this one campaign just for all of it to be for nothing, kinda sucks really hard. A real buzzkill. 

Now I feel reluctant to start any new campaigns because I don't want all my fun to be ruined by one small 'bug' of sorts. 

Also, this game is not suitable for two or less players. You really need a full party of 3 to really stand a chance at the many difficult encounters that do not scale to accommodate smaller parties. I have managed to succeed at the odd campaign with two players, but it does feel like an inexplicably harsh uphill battle and not a fun challenge. This was on the easier difficulties as well.

I'm also not a fan of the camera snapping me back and forth when I'm looking around the map, so it just feels a little clunky and counter intuitive at times.

Also, Lore Books aren't shared across players, so if I start the campaign and have a certain character slot on the character creation, I'll be hard locked into getting the first loot roll and never get any Lore Books",1641755922,1641755922,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is hex-based exploration and turn-based combat. While both are reasonably polished, neither was engaging enough for me to want to keep playing. Your characters have no personality and do not develop in any way aside from gaining arbitrary levels that give you more HP. Combat skills are determined by your equipment, and while in a way this was quite fun because it meant you were constantly trying new skills as you got new equipment, it felt like there was no real progression of your characters (this is true 5 hours into the first campaign, I don't know if it changes later or is different in other campaigns). 

Mainly, playing this game just made me want to go and play WIldermyth instead, because I missed growing attached to my characters as they developed in a bunch of unusual and fun ways, and watching them fall in love or become enemies or joke together.

One thing I didn't like was the time limit, but there are campaigns that don't have them, 3 I think, and you can jack up the chaos in the house rules and it's so much that time isn't a factor anymore really.

It's a little slow, and I do recommend reading the help manual because even though it doesn't seem to make much sense at the time, once you start playing it has that ""Oh!  That's what that mess was about!"" factor to it.  It is addictive, and a calm way to pass time as you will get pulled into it.  You just want to see how far you can get, or even make up your own strategies on how you want to play it.

I went into it happy it had full controller support, however once I started it became more of junky and awkward and then I had a Homer Simpson moment *DOH!*  It's basically point and click easy, I felt silly at this realization.

If you want a colorful way to be drug into a point click RPG style kind of game, this is it!

The game is made up of a handful of different campaigns to choose, the map is generated randomly each time so every game will be different even if the end goal is the same. Different campaigns have different mechanics, for example in the ""For the King"" campaign you get a bit of everything, while there is also a winter-themed expansion based around town sieges and cold damage, and an ocean-themed one that mostly uses the ship travel mechanic.

It's not really a game for people who hate rolling dice, every attack you make has a chance of missing that seems to be frustrating for a lot of people. It's also a game that puts you on a timer, you can't just grind your way out of problems - though with good time management you should be able to know when you can afford to gain a little more experience. I also wouldn't call it a total luck-fest (got to be sure I type that right..) because as you learn the game mechanics you find there are ways to mitigate bad luck, and play risk management. Of course, it's a double-edged sword - it's always great too when luck goes in your favour and you find a really powerful weapon for one of your heroes (like that awesome double-edged sword.)

I do think the game is somewhat unbalanced in the class system, basically I found the fast classes are the best because they can take out enemies before they attack, which is a lot better than being slightly more defensive and slow. Some classes added later like the Treasure Hunter have cute but situational abilities and seem way under-powered compared to the rest.

I probably would never have picked [i]For the King[/i] up if I hadn't got a big discount coupon for it, but I think it's a pretty good game, a solid ""B"" Tier in my collection. The unique visuals, humour, and the thrill of every run being a little different overcame the moments of frustration for me.",1594989913,1640888834,True,5,2,0.575835466384887695,0,True,False,False

I mean.....I get it. But that whole systems pretty damn bullshit especially when the late game absolutely collapses because its just too hard without all the right unlockables. 

If we're all stupid ass level 6's, your leel 4 dungeon should be a breeze but its not because of arguably bullshit attempts of balancing and leveling.

If you want a adventure boardgamey RPG to play with friends then you should at least consider it, because there's good stuff here.

You can't check your equipment during other people's turn, or see combat pull ranges, honestly I just pull up the browser on the other monitor to toil while I wait for my turn. Also it's unclear that a surprise event disappears if you leave it. The game gets better when you unlock things like new characters, events, and weapons (which has become a extremely common crappy mechanic that game devs think is awesome but really only serve to be annoying for first-time players), but at least if you are playing with friends it combines what everyone has unlocked.

Enemies move way to fast in the turn order with no way make it better, enemies have too many abilities, and for some reason, even though players need to get 100% just to make their abilities work, enemies often times do not. Unless they're normal enemies, almost none of them are fun to fight against.

The adventures are hit or miss. The normal one, dungeon crawl, and lost civilization are alright. The frost level is just annoying to play through. Not the hardest, but clearly needs work.

Into the deep was straight up amateur in its design. Unnecessary spikes in difficulty, uninspiring encounters that should never have been allowed except for the highest difficulty, with sluggish and obnoxiously crafted dungeons. You either can't play through them because you're level 2 and they're level 6 (which matter more than one would think), or you're at the right level but the overpowered enemies get to you after sometimes 5 rounds of combat. There is no way to heal consistently in between. And because everything is so unbalanced, you HAVE to rely on statues just get by. I shouldn't have to rely on an optional point of interest just to have fun with a campaign.

I won't comment on endless mode because I don't care about it, and probably won't matter much aside from completing achievements.

The stat system in this game is also awful. while the stats themselves are fine, they're no reliable way to level them up directly and relies way to much on weapons and equipment. And the accuracy system tied to is clearly not something the developers took time to think about. Everything in this game has accuracy slots that must all be passed to deal the full damage. higher stat = hit better. Except because the game RNG was made to fight the players instead of being fair or reasonable, unless you waste focus for basic attacks, you will be screwed not matter what.

And speaking of focus, it's a necessity in this game. You use for fighting and reaching places barely out of grasp. Too bad the game didn't come with a system to either have them regenerate over time or by day.

And the movement system is probably the second worst aspect of this game. RNG for MOVEMENT. Who thought that was a good idea? Just give the characters predetermined movement or movement that scales over time.

The random events are hit or miss. Not much to say other than, meh.

While this game is fun at stages, there is just so much wrong with this game. Unless you have 2 friends you want to play with (Which is way to small for this game. 5-6 should have been the cap), don't buy this game unless you're one those gamers who like rediculous and maddening odds, or mistake unbalanced, lazy, and poor game design (Mostly talking about into the deep) as ""challenging."" 4/10. Not completely irredeemable, but into the deep alone destroys most of the fun as it perfectly highlights the numerous and embarrassing oversights. At least its cheap.

Quick update. I picked this up for the Switch, very awesome to play as a grab and go. However, there is a hit to in-game performance. Turns and rolls feel like they take longer to process thus making already lengthy games more lengthy, but the controller UI feels better than Steam's.

Along with completing objectives, and encountering adversaries, I find that this is what keeps the game more engaging. 

By far the most entertaining aspects of the game is how each character specializes in a important role to help another, and the adventure you'll have with everyone working together as a team. 
It's also exciting to see what kind of drops we'll be rewarded with, as they can deliver significant boosts and other immunizes.

I've spent a long time trying to enjoy this game, i've unlocked over half the lore store, i've tried dozens of builds, i've even played with a full party of experienced tactical gamers, the game is just unbalanced plain and simple.

If they make some changes to how much damage the enemies do, or make their rolls more reasonable (at least make it on par with the players rolls) it would fix the majority of the issues with the game. The focus is a nice touch, but it's so difficult or expensive to get (in some case making you choose between getting focus back or health) that it can hardly be considered a balancing feature against the near perfect rolls the enemies seem to get every combat. 

Great art style, amazing concept, probably the WORST rng mismatching i've seen since Fire Emblem, or XCOM and i'm pretty sure they had better balancing than this.

tl:dr - CANNOT recommend until they fix their balancing issues, and update their UI to reflect the accurate roll percentages. the features they have in place (focus) do not equalize the difference, and leaves the entire 2-5+ hour run entirely on chance.",1639186906,1639186906,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Second off, it uses true RNG, which can be infuriating, if you're not the type who's okay with that, this game definitely will not be for you. However, you can gain all the achievements by changing the 'homebrew' rules to give yourself more shots, which might make the game quite slow paced.

TL;DR  Too much RNG spawning of enemies.  It would be more fun for a single player if it was more roguelite than roguelike.

        I realize the high difficulty of this game is intended and multiple replays are very much expected, but there are some RNG moments that, for a single player trying to make progress, just make the whole game overly frustrating and completely diminish the appeal for replay. 
       The map shows where enemies are, but not really, as they can RNG on any player adjacent tile without warning as an ""ambush"".   This is a cool difficulty mechanic i guess, but it happens so often early game to parties that can hardly get around the map as it is.  The game is ""stifling"" for that reason.  After an intense boss battle where all of my party members were depleted from a very narrow and intense victory, a powerful enemy randomly spawned at a tile adjacent to the battle and wiped my whole party instantly.  You have to let players enjoy their victories to some extent, as they are difficult to accomplish as it is.  The random spawning of enemies adjacent to players occurs far too much to expect me to keep at it when it becomes obvious that this happens constantly.  I have had more encounters with unseen RNG ambush enemies than enemies actually visible on the map, and for me that removes a lot of my ability to use the map for strategic movement.  Too much getting beat down by out-of nowhere enemies, not enough mechanics that favor the player and the ability to continue the game.
       The game otherwise is beautiful and inviting, a well crafted visual experience, and it really does have an awesome DnD-like tabletop vibe.  I just wish I could get past the RNG on steroids aspect that can make it super un-fun.  If my characters kept at least some of their progress,  that would definitely raise the appeal for replay.
      Dying is always more fun with friends, pretty much across the board on most games, so I imagine people co-opping will have a much better experience.  If you plan to get this game to play yourself,  I can't recommend it.

The enemy design is fantastic and the game can be a lot of fun with your friends or even just by yourself.

I like the roguelike elements. They provide a reason to return to the puzzle. I like the classes and other design elements, though after my first 8-hour encounter I could tell that I was starting to want more variety.

In short, For the King is a delightful little number that might best be enjoyed in co-op play with friends. It's definitely worth the sale price I bought it for, at any rate.",1567655370,1638261106,True,5,1,0.554054081439971924,0,True,False,False

For the King has found a way to revive the fun I used to have with them back in the day and it's always a joy to play it. All of the maps always have some level of randomly generated tiles, monsters, traps and loot in them to keep it from getting stale, which is one of the reasons I like it so much. Despite being an indie game, they have also managed to keep the balance very well. I feel like if I failed a run or a fight that it was my fault and not the game's. Of course, again, there are some RNG elements in the game that can definitely make it harder sometimes and feel like it's not always your fault, but I think that brings in another layer of fun.

It's also amazing to be able to play with you friends. As I am getting older, I find it harder to focus on singleplayer games and continue with them, so even a genre like this I always enjoy being able to bring my friends in with me and it makes it even more fun. Not having to control all three characters allows me a little downtime and to relax while I play. Making fun of each other when we roll bad, or getting hyped up when we roll crits is way more fun than when you are by yourself.

The cosmetic rewards in-game and all of them being free is also very nice. I'm generally pretty sick of every single game these days charging money in a cash shop for cosmetics, but going the classic route of unlocking through achievements and/or in-game currency is the most fair and fun way to go about it, so it's nice they went that route. 

Overall, the game is a solid 9/10., I think the only really negative things I can say about the game are that it does have RNG elements, and while I enjoy them a lot, I can understand why some people dislike that kind of thing. And of course, it does have very blocky/indie graphics. It feels more like a stylized choice than anything bad, and I enjoy them, but again, I can easily see how some people might not. If a few layers of light RNG and some polygonal graphics isn't a negative for you, you will probably enjoy the game as much as me.",1638258222,1638258222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You will quickly find that enemies deal way too much damage and inflict status effects that are so devastating and costly to get rid of you will constantly be out of resources, money, and hp.

Oh and the game is also basically a race against the clock so you don't even have time to try and gather resources or try to get a foothold. The game is constantly adding enemy hp multipliers, and even more annoying game state changes on a timer, and you move so slowly you can never keep up.

Everything in the game costs tons of money - even resting becomes insanely expensive - it's stupid. For example, midgame a single herb costs 160g and you'll need about 3 per fight and at the end of the fight, you only get like 65-100g... And if you want to rest you'll need a super rare item that costs a ton of money just to camp, or spend 85g per person to rest in a town, plus you'll need even more money per person to get rid of all the permanent curses or poison that will keep ticking long after a fight is over.

Then there's enemies that will literally steal all your gold and run away, and there's nothing you can do to stop it...

There's enemies that spit acid that destroys your items permanently and there's nothing you can do to block it, just hope you still have a super expensive, limited supply herb to fix it.

Monsters deal way more damage than you, have higher resists and more hp... There's literally nothing you can do.

Unlike D&D though, the game doesn't have a great story. I don't even remember what the main goal is even though I played through the start many times. Instead of relying on its story, For the King bets on its mechanics being strong enough to carry your interest.

It has great mechanics and its loop feels great. It's a roguelike wherein you take a group of characters out into the game world and fight your way through story beats or just explore around until a misstep or RNG introduces the group to the grim reaper. This is important: **** the game is heavily dependent on randomly generated content***

The world map changes on each try, attacks depend on random dice rolls, so do saving throws, surprise encounters placement in the map are random (and I feel like so are their difficulty), resources placement in the map are random, item drops are obviously random, etc. Everything depends on RNG. So, you gotta be able to be like Elsa and let it go when the game seems to punish you for no particular reason. For example, frightening all of your characters at once because they all failed a saving throw even. This basically forced me sit back and watch my characters get pummelled without being able to do anything. You can build up some stats against some of those things, but I found more efficient to just amass items that grant immunity. The problem with that strategy is that the RNG sometimes will give you none, so you're sh*t out of luck there. To be fair, the fright thing happened once and in general the game has been fair to me. I feel like my efforts to get further have been rewarded well.

You amass some points for completing events/encounters and these points can be used to unlock more characters, chance encounters, chance items, resource spawns, etc. These ease the blows from RNG and basically make you feel like you gain something with each try. That is basically what keeps me playing. I do worry that I may lose interest once I've unlocked everything there is to unlock though. But, I think that won't happen for many more hours to come.

If you take risks conservatively, are frugal with resources, are mindful of the game clock, the risk of RNG-wipe is comparable to similar games. 

So that didn't bother me. Instead, I found the game dull and a bit tedious. For being an RPG, there's not much going on. There's no skills to upgrade, and the loot system is pretty constrained. (In the first biome, you can find boots +1, in the second biome, you can find boots +2, etc). For being a roguelike, runs don't vary much. Each restart feels pretty similar, except that now you're a bit more efficient. 

This is compounded by it being a pretty slow-paced game. With little randomization in events, world-generation, items, or characters, there isn't really any sweetness to the grind. And it makes the game feels more like a puzzle-solving game than an RPG roguelike. 

I did appreciate it's whimsically generic setting, puffy graphics, and oddly down-to-earth fantasy role playing.

Unfortunately, even if it was enjoyable, I do consider this game a negative point. Don't get me wrong, it is a good game. The battle mechanic, the random chance that makes you sue at times.  Die and repeat. Everything that I laughed and having funs with my friends. 

But, whenever you do play the game and someone is going afk for a while, you will wait that long time until your friend returns. There are nothing to do while waiting. I quite often did my laundry or my chores at home while waiting. But since the campaigns are also quite long, they really feel shallow as you go farther in your current story. Without forgetting that the objectives are repeatitive from one campaign to another. The big difference between those campaign would be more the map mechanics that you do need to differ.

After one full run to complete the game, I really felt my dose for the game. When we managed to play the second campaign, I felt bored to finish it. For me, it's quite some bad repeatitive quests and unfun on a full run. For a Roguelike, the game itself is really a longplay that it could require around a roughly 5-6 hours average. I am no joking. If you die at the end, you lost all those hours you wasted and you restart the game from scratch (with the little benefits you will unlock. But still). Even other Roguelike games aren't that long. That's my big deception.


In the end, the game is good as concept. But due to the long hours of sessions with the repeatitive quests/sidequests, For The King burned me out quickly as for not playing it after 1 or 2 victory games, getting unjoyable on the long run.",1637116028,1637116028,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You'll find this game fun if you're able to keep it casual with friends or just roll with the punches in a single player game. I say ""roll with the punches"" because 99% of this game is based on random chance - attacking, critical hits, casting spells, discovering/getting rewards from random encounters, almost everything is based on a dice roll. The only things that aren't are a select few spells scattered around, one such being the ""party heal"" skill which is a life saver much of the time.

Enemies have a much easier time with their rolls. They share the same attack system of rolling a dice several times to determine effectiveness, but where your mage might need to roll a perfect 5 action roll to set a single person on fire, the enemy kobold can fail an action in his 3 action roll and still light your entire party on fire. I mention mage specifically because even if you fail much of your roll trying to damage the enemy with a sword or bow or basic magic damage, the enemy still takes minimal damage. On the flip-side however, if you fail even a single action roll while trying to cast a buff/debuff spell, the spell fizzles and does absolutely nothing.

There is a Focus system that you can use to guarantee successful dice rolls (e.g use 1 point of focus to guarantee 1 roll), but it's incredibly limited and with many of the in-game missions being on a time limit, you're scarcely able to properly refill your Focus bar before any big fight without wasting time or items, making the game harder as a result.

The game is very sided towards losing; which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's sure as hell frustrating to lose because not one of your heroes succeeded at more than one action over the course of 4 turns. If it took even one less action roll to do more powerful abilities I might like this game a lot more, as it's an incredible turn off to find a powerful spell or ability and have to succeed at *six* rolls just to be able to see its effect - all this on a character that was designed to use the spell or ability to begin with (and therefore has an easier time casting it).

It's easier to ignore just how unfair this game is at times when you've got a friend or two to play with, but solo when you've only got yourself and the teasing dice rolls can be grating.

For someone like me who can't resist the urge to nerd out and micro-analyze every aspect of something until I understand it, trying to get this game down to a consistent science for each playthrough like other games is a pointless task. With everything being rng it's hard for me to find any fun beyond a certain point or to get much farther than I have any previous run. The only thing that you can do is *hope* that you get better roles and better items/encounters along your journey (which you can unlock more beneficial ones via playing but these are again, randomly generated).

It supports up to 3 players but you can also play solo and control 3 characters. The game a has a lot of replayability with there because different campaigns you can run and different team comps you can build. 

Story-wise there isn't much. Like it introduces one and it's there, but it's there's not much to it and it's uninteresting. At least I felt that way. I honestly can't even remember what the main campaign was about. 

This game is entirely based on RNG and that's a huge turn off for some people. Most of the negative reviews are because this is the way the game is structured. If you like trying to maximize your RNG chances or succeeding a 20% chance roll then I highly recommend this game. If you don't like the concept of RNG controlling everything then maybe stay away. Even if you aren't too good at the game there's a lot of game rule modifiers that make the game a lot easier. 

I have yet to encounter any bugs in this game except the ones that attack you. 

I think my main complaint for this game would be that, generally, you need to follow a balanced team comp of: healer, damage, and tank, to actually win. There's different comps you can try and still beat the game with but on the harder difficulties something like a full damage team won't work.",1636523749,1636523749,True,10,0,0.639836251735687256,0,True,False,False

Fergus is a lepracon that has a random chance of stealing your drops.
Normally in my experience, they are at the level you are or around there when they are in effect.
I was barely at level 4 in my party and level 8 Fergus pops up.

What makes it worse, is Fergus has MULTIPLE advantages that can render him impossible to beat under bad circumstances
- You need literally perfect roles, or they are guarenteed to miss
- He has a really high chance of stealing your stuff, and immediately running
And when he runs, you need to fight him again with him back at full health.

I'm going to have to restart this run because no way am I putting up with my loot getting taken at random with no way for me to fight back. Even when I managed to take down half his health, he would without fail steal something, run, and make me fight him at full health again.

This game has a bad problem with some situations feeling rigged, that you can overcome with strategy.
Yeah nah, situations like this I'm just gonna call ""Overwhelming odds to the point that the game is cheating."" Like seriously, giving me a level 8 boss when we JUST got to level 4?

You fail rolls a lot as a character, and yet enemies nearly never ever fail them. While some challenge is in order, PERFECT ROLLS grant additional damage or status effects. These enemies get this almost guaranteed which doesn't seem to have been taken into account.

Also some poorly thought out enemy types. Like an early game one that does about half a healthbar of magic damage, can only be hit by a perfect roll, and inflicts shock. Shock makes it impossible to get perfect rolls. Also makes it impossible to run away.

On the other end, it's an RNG nightmare that almost constitutes as a cop out to play longer. As with most of my reviews, this is going to be a long read, but I make sure people understand what they're buying before getting it. 

[h1] THE GOOD [/h1][list]
[*] There are a LOT of different classes and different builds, including the Hobo, which can basically be any class but doesn't get any kind of special bonus. 
[*] The cell shading art is pretty good, but it's nothing to write home about. I am very impressed that each piece of equipment actually does change the design of your character, which is nice.
[*] It is very much so a Rogue-like, and death is basically guaranteed.
[*] Multiplayer is always fun. [/list] 

Unfortunately, this is where the cool things about this game ends. 

[h1] THE BAD [/h1][list]
[*] 99% of the things in this game is RNG based, except for the mobs who will almost always hit you, get buffs off, or debuff you. 
[*] The RNG is to the point where it's extremely frustrating. I can understand RNG on getting attacks or doing whatever, but does everything have to be rolled individually? Why can't it just be a flat percentage based on the requisite stat? Having up to 5 ""Tokens"" that are individually rolled to see if you even do anything is a bit absurd. It would be much better if if were just ONE roll based on the requisite stat that determines how effective your action is. Look, I've played some HARD games, ok? I've conquered all the Dark Souls games, all the Castlevania games, and survived games that are brutally challenging, but this seems difficult in a way where the player can't really adapt for. Your survival isn't based on tactics, it's based on 100% dumb luck, which takes all kinds of control from the player. 
[*] Some of the mobs aren't even fair, and some of their mechanics are broken. The ""Evasive"" property found on certain mobs is completely unfair when 9/10 of the mobs disable your characters, and the Lightning debuff is horrendous. Basically, it auto-fails one token, which doesn't sound so bad until you're faced with mobs that have the evasive property and now you're effectively stuck in a never-ending loop until you die, because there's basically no way to beat it. 
[*] I've had this game for like a year or so now? And I can only stomach the 35-36 hours I have on record. It's just that frustrating. Want your tank (Blacksmith) to tank? Roll twice on a rare stat and if you fail them, you wasted your turn. Want your damage class to do something? Roll 4-5 times, and if you fail one roll (Which is very likely), you'll do basically no damage. Want your Support class to buff? Roll 3-4 times, and if any of them fail, the entire thing fails and you wasted your turn. [/list]

[h1] TL;DR / CONCLUSION [/h1]

I really want to like this game. I love rogue-like games and I am a fan of challenging games, but not to where the challenge places the challenge to actually play completely out of your control. There is very minimal RNG reduction and I just can't be bothered to continue this. Take from this what you will, but I can't recommend. If you want a challenging rogue-like that isn't completely shaming you for playing, try Hades, Slay the Spire, One Step from Eden, or Darkest Dungeon. Those are very challenging and yet feel like the power of having control is up to your decisions and your ability as a player instead of total luck.",1635195512,1635195512,False,1,0,0.460600197315216064,0,True,False,False

I've lost many, MANY runs and had characters die on which I had spent weeks of my life. I say all this to give you some perspective, so you don't think I'm just ""mad because I'm bad"".
This title has so much potential, but as it is now the game has several mechanics which are frustrating, un-fun and in my opinion, inherently incompatible with each other and the genre as a whole. 

Point #1: A single run in this game is Loooooong. Of my 18hrs. of playtime, more than 14 was spent on a single campaign from beginning to final boss. Not only that, but much of your time is spent clicking around the overworld trying to scrape together enough gold to buy gear and supplies for the next boss dungeon. (Grinding)

Point #2: The turn based combat has very little depth or strategy. There are two types of damage in the game, Physical and Magic. Some enemies are resistant to physical, some magical. 90% of your turns are going to be doing the same middling attack with the highest accuracy rating against the weakest enemy. ""But wait!"" you might exclaim,""What about the 50 status ailments, buffs and debuffs in the game? Surely they provide some spice and variety? Surely you would want to cast other spells and use other abilities?""
To which I would reply, ""Nope."" and in Point #3 I will tell you why.

Point #3: Risk aversion & Action economy are the two biggest forces that will drive your decisions in game, and you will constantly be forced to skip events or play it safe in combat because [i]the penalty for whiffing a roll is way too high[/i]. I learned this lesson the hard way a few hours into my very first run. I saved up enough gold to buy a nice boat, set sail and happened upon a ""Nice fishing spot"". I made the mistake of accepting a random roll with unknown outcomes and next thing I know, the Kraken had destroyed my boat and shipwrecked my entire party. I ended up out 200 gold, wasting 5 turns, and a permanent -1 to all stats for each hero. I don't know what the positive outcomes were, but if it was in line with other events I probably would have found a free item of medium-low value. Many other events are similarly not worth the risk.
Likewise in combat, as I mentioned earlier, every single special effect, debuff or buff [i]without exception[/i] requires a perfect roll to take effect. It has proven to never be worth attempting these abilities, because when you fail, your entire turn is wasted. It is also usually never worth it to switch weapons because that eats an entire turn as well. Staying in combat for as few rounds as possible and minimizing damage is key to survival as the devs did not see fit to include combat healing magic. Every point of HP you need to heal will cost you consumables or gold.

What it feels like: Picture this scenario - You're 8 hours into the run, just sailed across the ocean in high spirits after beating the area's boss. You pick up a bounty from the next capital city and head off into the wilds to fight some monsters. You spend a couple of hours slaying overworld mobs and mini-dungeons until you can finally afford that upgraded wand and boots in town. Now that you are ready you head down to the next boss dungeon. On floor three you get crit twice, everyone is on fire and one person is petrified. One failed armor buff roll and a failed taunt roll later, everyone goes down, run over. Guess you should have spent another hour grinding to buy some more consumables.

Final thoughts: No one wants to devote this much time to a roguelike run. No one wants to lose a run to events they felt were beyond their control. I personally don't want to play a game where you never get to make real and impactful decisions, you just roll the dice and hope for the best. With a little reworking this game could be great, but as it stands now it is not worth buying.",1635028739,1635028739,False,41,4,0.635235905647277832,5,True,False,False

very hard to finish any campaigns, take some time to get to the end and is always quiet hard to stay alive anyway
you will die a lot at start, until you understand what combos are good for you and learn the items interactions
but then you will die again a lot xD
RNG is brutal
to obtain any good loots you will need to be smart on what you do

I have a friend that dislikes rng games unless its traditional rpgs. he played it by himself and he didnt like it.
Though once me and another friend got him into a lobby we all started having fun. Like me and friend 2 were supports and we just kept finding stuff that buffed friend 1 (by the way friend 1 was a woodcutter) and he just kept getting crit after crit after crit!

anyway would i recommend this game?

The overall aesthetic and visual design is charming enough, the rough polygons mould a world that jumps right out of a storybook page.

My one gripe is the game's core reliance on RNG. I understand that the idea of your fate being influenced by chance and circumstance is integral to DnD and, broadly speaking, a ""hero's adventure"". But it can get substantially frustrating when you fail an almost guaranteed attack roll 3 times in a row, which then results in a party wipe. Even more so when you're taking on the final boss during a Master-difficulty run.

Of course, FTK does provide mechanics that help mitigate the ire of our RNG gods. For instance, the Focus system provides a guaranteed success roll per Focus point used. This goes a long way to preventing that Critical Fail at an unfortunate time. Additionally, your equipment and consumables all provide stats that influence your roll chance. However, there's always a chance of failure no matter what.

In short, if you can stomach the inherent RNG-nature of FTK. Then you'll find the rest of the game undoubtedly enjoyable.",1634575060,1634575060,True,2,0,0.554054081439971924,0,True,False,False

The amount of damage you deal is by ""chance"" then followed by if it actually hits the enemy which also by ""chance"" (i.e. dodge, block, or hit). Then there also unexpected events that is also by ""chance"" which will reward you or disappoint you by ""chance"". Basically, if you're into games that depends on ""chances"" this will be the game for you, but if you're like me, who is not a fan of Gameplay-is-decided-by-chance game, well you should probably look for something else.

Now, I'm not one to say the RNG isn't correct with the percentages, I have absolute faith that that 68% happens 68% of the time because the law of large numbers will absolutely apply.

EVERYTHING is random. Oh you want to swing your sword... random x 5! Oh you want to do a stat challenge, Random x 3. Oh, you want to freaking MOVE random x 6. 

So basically when literally everything is based on chance at some point it will bone you. You have focus that you can use to lessen your luck but guess what... you get 4 focus points and every swing of your weapon is 2-4 rolls. So good luck.

Story:
The story of this game is pretty average, but it fulfills its purpose. There's evil in the world, and it grows stronger if you ignore it. Follow the main quest to uncover its lairs and progress towards the source. 

Combat:
The combat is designed around a party of 3 characters, though you can play with fewer if you really want to ramp the difficulty. Turn-based, where the turn initiative is based on your speed stat, but you can use various weapon abilities to slow down enemies or speed up allies. The damage feels good, and the ragdoll on defeated enemies feels satisfying.

Sound design:
Hits feel satisfying, the Minstrel/Busker attacks being guitar/lute riffs are a nice touch, and the background music is calm and enjoyable.

Graphics:
It's a low-poly style, but everything feels unique. They manage to get details across with simple (but well-made) models rather than high-resolution textures. Lighting is atmospheric, and everything is interesting to look at.

Unlocks:
The game will pay out Lore Books that will allow you to unlock game content from the main menu. These can only be used on playthroughs after you have unlocked them (as far as I know). Everything from weird weapons and armor to new and unique map tiles can be purchased with this token-like currency. There are even a few classes to be had this way. Worry not, however, as you can get Lore Books by simply playing through a game normally, or even using one of the non-story gamemodes that have a higher payout percentage.

Difficulty:
Honestly, the difficulties are actually pretty nice. Apprentice, the lowest tier, is good for you first *several* playthroughs. The Journeyman difficulty is definitely challenging (at least for me). I haven't tried any higher, though I'm positive the 3rd difficulty level is absolutely insane. Additionally, you can set up House Rules for things like Chaos frequency (how often the game tries to corrupt the world), starting Lives (you normally start with 6, 2 for each character), or Economy Inflation (how much more expensive things get as you progress). These do affect your Lore Book payout, but the minimum is still 50% of the regular gameplay on Journeyman, so it's not like you can't progress at all on super-duper easy mode.

This game has gotten me through some hard times, both pc-related and life-related. Honestly one of the best purchases I've ever made. Hell, I'm playing it right now actually, just opened the store page and saw I hadn't left a review.

Pros:
The game has an insane amount of replayability as it slips right between the cracks of being a rogue-lite and a rogue-like. What this means is that pretty much everything in the game is procedually generated and your progress is reset whenever you get a game over, be that by beating the game or losing.
The only reason why I consider a TINY part of the game to be a rogue-lite is due to certain upgrades, such as statues and shrines.
Another great thing about this game is the focus system. Every character have a resource called focus that can be spent on certain things. Some of these things can be gaining more movement spaces or automatically suceeding rolls, thus removing part of the RNG while still retaining certain aspects of it.
Speaking of rolls, the majority of things that happens in the game are determined by dice rolls, similarly to TTRPGs (Table Top Role Playing Games) and as such the game lets you somewhat manipulate the odds.
Spending focus is a way to suceed MOST rolls automatically but the resource is not something that recovers naturally. Another way to increase odds which is really common is by boosting a characters stats.
If you boost vitality for example, your odds of succeeding when attempting to taunt will increase IN ADDITION to increasing max health. All but one stat have these effects.
The difficulty is largely tied to how long you take in the game, like the Risk of Rain games. You see, this game can get more challenging the longer you take but spending more time lets you get stronger. Also the difficulty of the game is highly customizable.
There are way more great things about the game I won't mention here but if i can only name one more, then it has to be the fun you can have with friends. The game is kind of like Mario Party as it can both make and break friendships.

Cons:
The game has a fairly small playerbase and therefore your best shot to find online lobbies is by using the games discord server.
There is one stat that doesn't quite make sense to me and that is luck. It doesn't increase any stats, not even luck or dodge and its only uses are accuracy for very specific weapons and also certain random events/encounters that are far and few between.
Equipment matters WAY more than levels or anything else really when it comes to making your characters stronger but this is just a personal dislike.
The ""endless"" gamemode ( called Hildebrants Cellar) is probably the one thing that doesn't feel randomly generated. Atleast when compared to the rest of the gamemodes.

Conclusion:
The game can be really fun if you play it with friends and it's still a really solid game if you play alone.
RNG matters a LOT but can be easily manipulated.
There is nearly endless replayabillity and playstyles.
One more thing I didn't mention before as it is a neutral opinion is that you can easily sink a long time into this game as the campaigns are randomly generated each playthrough. This also means that if you don't have a lot of free time, then this game might not be the game for you.

Waifu Secret 2 is more of the same from its original counterpart, offering lewd stories broken up in segments in between pipe-connecting minigames. You play the role of an author looking for story ideas when you're approached by someone who offers you details about people you know and people she knows until you inevitably have sex with her as well.

The dialogue isn't flawless and there's definitely a bit of cryptic guess work trying to figure out what some lines actually mean, but it's definitely serviceable. The visuals, while still decent, feel like they're an overall downgrade from the first game. At times the animations come across as lazy, such as moments where a character will be spread open before penetration begins. There is occasional voice acting, which is nice to see, but nothing that overly stands out in the game.

There are some minor technical issues as of the moment of this review, one of which includes missing pipes that makes certain levels impossible to conventionally complete. The developer has stated that these will be addressed shortly. Fortunately, pressing the F key seems to instantly complete a level. What makes this even nicer is that achievements and progress are not tied to your ability to earn 3 stars on each level, merely that you are able to complete that level. What this means is that if you want to skip the puzzles and get to the story/lewd bits, you have the full capability to do so.

Ultimately, I think that if you played Waifu Secret 1, you've already experienced the full range of what the sequel game has to offer. I had hoped there would be more of an expansion on the gimmick, but gameplay really doesn't seem to be at the forefront of their attention. I understand it's a lewd game and so you want to show people lewds, but you're also selling a video game.

If you're going to buy the game, get it at 50% off if possible. Two dollars is a decent price but I stand by my belief that playing the first game amounts to the same experience as the second, and so it's kind of redundant and feels like you're just buying the same game twice. I actually found the first game to be much more enjoyable and had a better range of characters. This honestly feels like it could have been DLC for the first game and done better-- but it is what it is. You know if you'll like it or not.",1632688128,1632688128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Installed it and played with a friend for 5 hours straight. Definitely going to play a lot more.

You get a lot of ups and downs during the story. Sometimes you drop a lot of things and you feel invincible and then suddenly another encounter melts all your armor and weapons. So if you like that, it's fun.

If you like turn based strategy games at all, you'll probably like this.  I'm not even personally a massive fan of the genre, but this one is put together well and has vast replay-ability.

My only critique might be that enemies probably have too good of RNG on rolls, especially when they can get added effects from their attacks with out getting perfect rolls, where as players generally have to get perfect rolls to do things like bleed, stun, slow, etc.

I really wish they hadn't discarded their plans to make the game mod-friendly.  This game could suck up so much more of my time with custom campaigns/chars/items/events/etc.

It does not try to surprise you with high level graphic, but what it does shifts initial expectations - real physic in turn based battles, thousands different looks of the heroes and the enemies. 

The only thing I do not like is how co-op game immediately ends when one player disconnects. Would be good to have an option to replace him/her with  another person or with a bot or even decide to continue without him. It is pity when you game progress lost because a guy in 1000 km from you lost his connection.

Me and my 2 friends have tried the normal campaign and enjoyed it enough to try one of the other campaigns, Frost Adventure. We were extremely disappointed with how similar, even stripped down, it felt to the normal campaign. It had less features compared to the original and there weren't enough quests to do, we had to just grind without much aim which is exactly where the game falls off significantly. When we saw that the next campaign in line, Into the Deep, also had a somewhat similar structure, we decided to drop the game.

The characters don't even bring enough differences to the table, playing all characters feel more or less the same and most passives trigger so rarely that you don't even feel its effects (Justice, Inspire etc.) but especially one of them is extremely dominating, Party Heal. Playing a support character felt quite frustrating too, due to needing perfect rolls everytime to contribute something meaningul to the party. I found Talent stat in general to be extremely lacking as well, not impacting the game enough compared to Awareness or Speed.

Overall, this is a game plagued with many design flaws and a gameplay that can rapidly bore the players with no meaningful way of differentiation between runs and close to none replay value.

For The King holds a special place in my heart, it is not my most played game but most certainly my favourite one available on Steam.

It incorporates a bit of everything I enjoy! Simple yet very detailed visuals, cute in its own way! RPG and Roguelike elements that are not overwhelmingly difficult to understand yet challenging and enjoyable! A multitude of weapons and a wide array of obtainable loot! A turn based combat system allowing you to pause at virtually any time! Multiple gamemodes with local and online coop support!

It does include an RNG system and some dice rolls might seem unfair at first, but the odds of getting a successful roll can be upgraded, with enough preparation, the right gear and some strategy you can almost guarantee a successful fight. Sometimes a strategic error or a bad roll can be very punishing but this game is about adapting and making the best out of a bad situation! 

This game is not easy but it was never meant to be which is good because it makes achieving victory a lot more satisfying compared to other games where stats are just numbers you can overlook and abilities don't matter. This game is however not overly difficult either once you start learning about abilities, skills, stats, buffs and debuffs!

[b] For The King forces you to think ahead, anticipate the enemies next moves and adapt to the situation at any moment! Victory is not the goal, the journey is, victory is just the reward! [/b]",1630871570,1630871570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) With all party characters/enemies at level 10, enemies move close to 1.5x-2x as fast as my characters, and therefore have plenty of opportunities to buff themselves/debuff my party while maintaining their attack rate; 
2) While my mage had a wand that allowed her to use one healing herb to heal all 3 members at a go (thereby saving two additional herbs which would be needed otherwise), the herb supply (and gold required to purchase them, or to rest at the inn) is unable to keep up with the healing that I need to do after each battle.
3) Enemy damage output can easily take off 20% of HP after accounting for armor. Coupled with point #1, this is a heavy disadvantage to the party.
4) Level 10 enemies do not tend to miss often, and have very high armor ratings of about 30 which almost negates any damage that I can deal to them.",1630327039,1630327039,False,0,1,0.456351608037948608,0,True,False,False

I still love the game, and there are no doubt problems that make it a less-than ideal experience. However, I do think that this game is a worthy purchase (but only if its on sale.) The main story is a rather linear, yet enjoyable experience. The story itself doesn't change from playthrough to playthrough, but the way you go about it does. A lot of the game's core enemies you'll be fighting are randomized, meaning that difficulty curves can often be steep. Additionally, without knowing what you're doing, you will be wiped in a matter of seconds.

Pros:
-Fun gameplay
-Robust Customization options
-Extreme Replay Value
-Surprisingly Deep and Strategic

Cons:
-Sometimes, RNG will just screw you over
-Enemy leveling can be downright unfair at times
-Without prior knowledge or research, you will have a hard time

All in all, I sunk in more hours into this game than I thought I would, whether I'm playing it, researching stuff about it, or watching others play it. It's one of those games that has a surprising amount of depth to it. However, in order to appreciate the amount of depth it has, you'll have to sink in some hours to get a grasp on how the game is played.

Would I recommend this for beginners to the RPG genre? Not really, no.

Would I recommend this to people (like myself) that enjoy games that are extremely challenging? (Such as Darkest Dungeon/Binding of Isaac/Sekiro)

It is supported by an amazing community of people in the discord that have fun, help each other, create groups and all have the support of the Ironoak Team in the cord for when things occasionally bump. 

At the time of writing this I'm just over 400 hours or more of playing, I've unlocked everything in the Lore Store and slowly getting the final few achievements.

D&D aspect? Yes with a strong feel of a Table Top game. 
The rogue-like feel is there but as you continue to play, you unlock Lore credits to purchase more things to increase your world and weaponry for better winning chances. Similar to Hades(Love that game too).

You and a good buddy or your S.O. would love playing this together. Hours of good times.

I would like to see some more balance done to the character classes. The OG classes seem to be the best ones to use and some classes really feel like they under perform, but on the lower difficulties this doesn't matter.

For the King is a Rpg Dungeon Exploration game pretty much like DnD just without the GM. The game offer multiple different campaigns to play from giving a whole different experience to enjoy. With each new campaign there is different and new encounters so the experience is always new and different giving you endless replay ability. you can play solo or with two other friends as a party of three to make your experience enjoyable.

[b] Pros [/b]
[list]
    [*]Campaigns always have different encounters 
    [*]A lot of different classes to play from with there unique play-styles
    [*]Just like DnD do not split the party you are better as a group.
    [*]Game is very easy to pick up for a first timer.
    [*]Certain encounter may unlock something permanent for your next play through to.
[/list]
[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
    [*]A lot of things are locked behind shop so you're limited pretty early in the games.
    [*]Game can get really punishing when the whole party wipes then game over there no check points.
    [*]New DLC seem to prove difficulties and need retweaking 
    [*]Gold economy can be hard with friends so do expect some teamwork sharing as limited time shops fly by
[/list]

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
In all this game can ruin friendships as well and make happy moments. This is a game i'd recommend people to play with friends because you can share accomplishment and experience the campaign together to talk about your enjoyments and your dislike with the game. There can be some frustration with the game at the time but that part of the game just gotta be prepared for the next time going into your encounter.",1629295654,1629295654,True,1,0,0.520905971527099609,0,True,False,False

Just wanna start off by saying, nothing like failing 6 78% attack rolls across your 3 characters all in a row,  only to not hit the enemy once.
 you must be thinking, wow that enemy must have a lot of evasion stats, or caused some effect that jangled with my accruacy but nope. He had a skill where you can only hit him if its a perfect rolled attack.What a fun thing for the player, great design, just click a button for rng and see if you win or not, not too much skill in the game.
Dont get me wrong, i love a game with stats, i dont mind my weapon doing a variable amount of damage between X-X amount depending on rng, im ok with randomly missing swings because it lists the % chance of that landing. What i find really frustrating about this game is the balance between RNG and trying to play it safe. There is no middle ground when doing a mini game/ challenge on the board. Its either RNG is on your side and you get a item, or some gold and some XP, whoo nice work! Or its not on your side and your whole team gets hurt, or you get minus some XP, or a enemie encounter with just your characters that are close by. There is no, middle ground where nothing happens, thats what makes this so frustrating, if you want a good run, just keep on playing till you get lucky and are able to do all your rolls, hope enemies dont attack first for battles or target your healer, hope the shop is selling a better weapon instead of lower tier ones. Just so much luck in it, i understand its supposed to add a replability factor to the game, ny making every run different, but games have gotten to the point theres so many mechanics and features that are never explained but left up to chance and guessing and learning from death. Oh neat a enemy spat acid on me, Oh it dissovled my only weapon . . . Hey that imp is spamming spells so i should focus him first, oh he has a evade perk that makes it so anything that isnt a PERFECT rolled hit is a miss . . .  Oh you wanted to attack? too bad your in a stun loop with enemies so have fun watching them attack 4 times while you attack once. . . 
 The death in this game, theres no way to make saves, so once your team gets wiped, have fun restarting that whole campaign. . . How come a spell that has a 80% land rate, fails almost every time when i try it on a enemy 1 or two levels higher than me? im guessing because they have higher evade stats but the game dosent show or tell even what those are or do. If you already know everything about table top games like this and get the stats lingo, i can see how its fun, if you have no understanding of any of it, the game dose very little to break down what all the numbers at the bottom of your screen mean.

Wooow, so theres a in game shop to spend tokens to unlock different board pieces and better end game gear, i fucking hate games that put this grindy mechanic in to their games for the sake of ""content"". A lot of the things you unlock are pretty much needed if you want to beat the game. Your first 5 attempts in the game you will fail no matter what because of this artificial sense of progression. It forces the player to play the game longer in order to beat it, when this stuff should be unlocked from the beginning, like idol statues giving better stats, or being able to encounter random tiles with healers on them, instead of wasting 5 turns getting your 3 players back to a inn to heal. Then theres unlocks that are strictly chance based, They have results that range from getting a free item or some xp, to wiping out your ENTIRE PARTY, causing you to restart the campaign. Why is that even a punishment for a game in a game? theres no middle ground like mentioned earlier, so your are either doing a all rng run and praying to what ever god you believe in, Or playing it safe and dying fast due to horrible rng.

I first playd this game couch co-op at a friends house and had a blast! But after a good 8h grind in a day, ive come to see the flaws. Game is fun with friends, because you do not care if you win the campaign or not, playing single player and going for the achievements and trying to actually beat the game is just frustrating",1626985909,1627961618,False,1,1,0.490463227033615112,0,True,False,False

Pros:
1. Straightforward gameplay
2. Sometimes comical

Cons:
1. There's no point collecting weapons from loot or buying from tavern, they can break even from first time use.
2. Huge dependence on luck and dice roll

Music:
[ ] Mute it
[✔] Nothing memorable
[ ] Soothing and friendly
[ ] Smash the repeat button!

Difficulty:
[ ] excruciatingly hard like Dark Souls
[ ] challenging
[✔] just right
[ ] easy peasy

Graphics:
[ ] Eyesore
[✔] Not bad (very simple, low poly)
[ ] Good 
[ ] Eye-candy

Replayable Value:
[ ] First playthrough was enough hell
[✔] Once is enough
[ ] Maybe twice after some time
[ ] Replay instantly

Fun:
[ ] So boring that you decided to play another game
[✔] Very grindy
[ ] Some grinds, but still fun
[ ] Refreshing and exciting!

It's a good chill thing to play with friends but not have to spend a ton of mental effort strategizing. It's also a nice casual thing to play by yourself, for those times when you want to play something, but also have other things you need to get done at the same time.

I think the art style lends itself well to playing on lower spec hardware, so it's also great for laptops or portable systems. 

I won't pretend that it's perfect -- since it is just a turn based RPG, the core game loop can get stale after a while. The lore unlock system helps to keep it somewhat fresh, forcing you to try different game modes to unlock all the gear, but there's only so much you can do with ground this well trod.

I'd say get it. For the price, you probably won't be disappointed, and it's an instant recommend if you happen to get it on sale.",1626652574,1626652574,True,2,0,0.533394336700439453,0,True,False,False

I've never really played a game like this before but this is a fantastic option for this genre from what i can tell. It feels very much like a ""lite D&D"" experience where you can control different classes, focus on specific stats, gear, items, and such. Its extremely satisfying to play both solo and with friends. 

It is NOT intended to be beaten on the first play through but playing through again gets more interesting as you unlock new characters/classes, random encounters, gear, and more. 7 hours in and I ready to jump into another play through... and once i do beat this campaign - there are several more to play through too.

The story isn't all that great for me.  I've sunk nearly an entire 24 hours into it and I still can't really get past the first big boss no matter how much I grind beforehand or how many things I buy to buff myself.  And that comes down to the luck aspect.  In my last run, things went pretty well for me until I got into the maze and then, despite my 90% accuracy items, my attacks still missed 78% of the time (I was annoyed enough to do the math.)  So it's a fun little game.

I have completed 2 adventures on the lowest difficulty so far and completely failed at least twice. The new ancient civilization pack being a bit harder than the others I tried. 

I would love to see a four player mode available. I usually play games with my group of four. So, this game has been a no for us. I only play with my BF instead. 

Pros:
Peaceful Soundtrack
Variety of weapons, armors, events, ect. 
Play with friends
A good amount of revivals (actually use them instead of listening to your friend who says to just finish the kill...only to fail the roll) 
Ability to improve stats with items/ gain different skills and resistances

Cons:
Game just throws you in (at least this is the case if you play your first game online)
Dice rolls can eff you over hard
Can only play with 2 friends, not good for a group of 4
Will run out of healing herbs constantly, Each town only sells 3 of them

1. You can only play permadeath.

I don't know who gave game developers the idea that erasing hours of progress made a game more fun, but even if it did, to have permadeath as the only option only amounts to a way to frustrate players who don't like that kind of ""challenge.""

It's not really a challenge. Nothing should be called a game if it's only an all-or-nothing scenario.

I made it to the final fight and lost in round 2 after hours of traveling that map. Okay, so I should show up with a penalty in some inn, minus some items, perhaps. I should have to work to get tougher, recoup some stuff.

Nope. Gone. Erased. Start over.  F**k you, developers.

Devs: Add an option for a reset to a previous save point (go ahead and institute a penalty if you really feel you just have to hurt the player somehow).

2. When you get into a dungeon fight, you might have an inventory of stuff that could help you, but you can't use any of it once the fight starts. You can only change your weapon. 

Normally, someone might say, ""Well, then, plan well before you go in.""

Uh huh. Except that to make a plan you have to have some idea of what you're facing, and you often don't. Level one of the big end battle was an ice fight. Level two was a flame fight. Super. I have devices that will not only be useless for half my fights, but they'll weaken my character as well. This means that, just doing the math, it's better not to equip the Immunity to Fire device you earned from previous work, because its aggregate worth is zero. It helps you win one fight and nerfs the armor, resistance, talent you could have had by just equipping your catch-all device. So why bother to use these wonderful, powerful items if, when you need them, you can't get to them?

Developers: Why? Why not just let the player get a backpack item by sacrificing a turn, just like switching a weapon? Why be punks about this. ""Oooo, look at that awesome talisman you just picked up. Too bad you have no idea whether or not to equip it when you go into this dungeon. Hahahahaha!"" 

The virtues of this game are many, but the flaws are pretty annoying. It's like the game was designed to p*ss you off and pretend that makes for a ""challenging"" game.

I understand the game should be punishing but at the same time it should be rewarding. The game for me just doesn't seem to reward players enough to balance out the punishing.

Another feature that would be very nice would be to allow people to join into other peoples games. 
For example: You and your friend are playing a run but you leave the 3rd character slot open for people you join in and take control of that character for the rest of the run. The lobby could show what character it is and it's level and it's the choice of the person who hosted the game to have the slot open or locked. I feel it would it would make the game more multiplayer friendly as there is not much of a player base playing online with an open lobby to join.

2 seconds.. That's how long it took me to decide to buy this game after hearing an accurate description! I LOVE table top board games AND classic RPGs... this is that - perfectly blended AND CO-OP! 
It really is like playing a board game - and oh my is it fun. Graphics are clean and pretty. Story is 'meh' - whatever though - a board game's story is 'meh' too..if the game play can make up for it who cares? 
I played for 2 hours with 2 other friends and had a blast. Laughs, triumphs, and failures (breaking a brand new bow on a crit fail..RIP..such is a rogue-like). The time went by so quick and I cant wait to hop back in. 
So - with that being said, don't listen to the negative comments like I did for so long while pondering to buy this game. If you got one or two buddies to join up with and go on some adventures that are reminiscent of the ol' FF days, then don't wait - grab a copy and go to it!

This is not because it is a hard game, or because it was designed to be a challenge to the player. It's because, ultimately, the player does not decide whether they win or lose.

This is a game where every single thing you do is determined by a dice roll. Fortunately, boosting your stats will make you [strike] more likely to roll successfully [/strike] fail an 89% chance roll 3 times in a row, costing you your entire game and forcing you to start over.

Unlike DnD there is no charm or fun to be had in the rolls. Either you roll well and win or roll poorly and the game punishes you severely for nothing more than being unlucky.

In fact an entire crucial gameplay feature is that you can spend 'focus' to bypass levels of your dice rolls to give you better chances or even guarantee a successful roll, but its at this point the game clearly exposes itself as being a convoluted disguise for gambling, with the only reliable way to avoid gambling every single fight being to stock up on consumable items, which itself is an unfun and contrived way to play any game.

For the King is, sadly, a game where player decisions do not matter. Every last thing you will ever do in the game is at the mercy of the machine and the best of attempts or most solid of strategies can crumble instantly for no fault of your own. Unless of course you begin a monotonous grind to buy more consumables to fill up your focus (which is also even more impractical since there are limited amounts of consumables to be bought), but then you're having even less fun.",1622634272,1622634272,False,3,1,0.433821260929107666,1,True,False,False

- Cool aesthetic/art style.
- Turn-based RPG game with some fun abilities and wide range of classes.
- Interesting grid-like exploration.
- Some goofiness.
- House Rules built into the game for more game custimozation.
- Multiplayer so you can die with your friends.
Cons:

- The enemy RNG is ridiculous. I had a very high level team with top-tier gear and near-perfect hit chances and still missed multiple times while the final boss of the standard campaign (on Easy difficulty) never missed an attack and I barely won.
- It's a Rogue-like. Interesting concept, but it's not for everyone. I don't mind it, but I would've preferred this game just be a straight RPG.
- Balancing and scaling is just wonky sometimes, and can be very frustrating, as I'm a player who likes to complete as much stuff as possible to be prepared for an area (that will just go up in level without you realizing it).
- Most game modes make you feel rushed, which isn't great sometimes, in a ""tactical"" turn-based RPG field.

Overall: 

The game is sadly addicting and I do very much so enjoy it, even with it's quirks. For it's price, it's definitely worth a buy.

Would it be too much to ask for a way to allow players to create their own adventure modules? Now THAT would be amazing.

The RNG is blatantly unfair. If this is something that will make you whine and pout, go play a different game. The stupid RNG is something that in my eyes adds to the fun of the co-op experience - nothing is more fun than laughing at your friends missing an 89% roll.
