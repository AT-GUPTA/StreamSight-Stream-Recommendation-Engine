Empryion is a space/survival game - you gather resources, kill enemies, and build ships to explore the galaxy . Sadly, that is about it- the main concept is good but everything else is meh.

Combat is one of the worst aspects of the game. POI's can range from easy to ' you  are dead in a microsecond'. Most weapons are pretty similar, and you can't crouch, throw grenades , etc. Enemies can hit you through walls( this could be a bug), and will generally spawn right on top of you. There are no set standards for POI's so in a singleplayer game you can get POI's that were clearly built for multiplayer, and vice versa. This leads to strategies like tunnel under the POI, because of the bad poi design.Ship to ship combat is terrible as well, and not worth the material cost. If you don't target the right parts of the ship it can take a while to destroy. Even then, it is still a major pain to loot those ships.

Enough about combat, onto graphics. The graphics in this game are meh, but this game is an EA game.... oh wait... it's not! The devs decided to remove the EA tag, because they considered the game feature complete. However, the game still looks an plays like a late stage alpha game. Granted the devs have come a long way, but the game needs to go a lot farther. Anyway... the large majority of the assets in this game are placeholder assets from the Unity engine. Sound, and audio cues can also bug out on occasion.

Finally, exploring: the game can be beautiful but I've found no reason to explore the vast cosmos-since all the planets look essentially the same...

Update: 

It has been(more or less) two years, since this review was initially posted. Unfortunately, Eleon has not done much in that time. They've updated water physics, reworked some  animations, and tossed in some more tedious bs. Besides that, nothing of note was added.

The ability to crouch, or walk in moving ships has still not been added in. Furthermore, the npc models are still placeholders in some cases. Thus, I am knocking my review score down from 6.5/10 to 4/10.

If you are interested, buy the game on sale.

Original score(2021): 6.5/10- Give it some time and it could turn out well.
Updated Score(2023): 4/10 -see below.
Update Score(2024)- 2/10- see below

The development team, while still supporting the game has failed to add anything meaningful to the game in the two years since this review was posted. The updated score reflects that.

As of 2/26/24; Eleon has released a paid dlc- for a game that is woefully incomplete.  Over the course of the 4 years after releasing from EA-not much has changed. My review score has been updated to reflect that.",1612223590,1708940526,False,60,4,0.68136751651763916,1,True,False,False

As the developer has decided to permanently ban me from the steam forums because I dared to voice my criticisms and gave them a negative review, I have decided to permanently ban them from my wallet. Avoid anything this development studio farts out like the plague!

I would also like to encourage anyone that they have banned for bogus reasons, as well as anyone who is dissatisfied with this product to report them to Valve for false advertising and their game being broken. Just look for a flag icon on the games store page, between the steam deck information and their ""Indiedb 2016 Indie game of the year"" award.

Unfortunately I had to edit out a large chunk of my original review to make room for this edit...

=== Old Review ===
The game can be very pretty but underneath is a bug ridden train wreck of a game. Half the systems don't work right and the other half are still using place holder systems from when the game was in early access for the first 5 years of its life and ALL of the game systems contradict and work against each other. Make no mistake this IS an early access game even if it isn't marketed as such anymore. What little life the game has is thanks to a VERY dedicated community that pumps out creations both for the developers  and players alike, for free. Next to no work seems to be done in-house by the developer besides refining the games graphics and tinkering around the edges of systems that don't really need work. System that have needed an overhaul for YEARS have been dutifully ignored.

What's that? You found a bug? GREAT! Report it to the developers then! Oh, but, wait... It better fit the EXTREMELY narrow and subjective view of whoever happens to look over your report. I have seen far too many issues simply dismissed out of hand because 'that's just how X works' or 'its been that way from the beginning' or 'has nothing to do with X game version because it was in the last 3 versions'. Oh, and they REALLY don't like it if you challenge them...They are known for being temperamental and deleting posts that may undermine their credibility on their official 'forums'. Yes, that's right Mr and/or Ms Eleon QA and Administrator, I'm calling you both out on this.

Having spent 4372 hours in this game I think I can speak with some authority on it's quality and how far it has come in the last 8(?) years.

EGS is a game with huge potential that is almost completely wasted by an incompetent, egotistical and ill-adjusted development team that would rather make something pretty then something that works. They do not appreciate their players and [i]volunteer[/i] bug testers, and they do not respect their community beyond the free work they can get out of it. The game is propped up and kept on life support by an extremely dedicated, if occasionally slightly rabid, community of builders and scenario creators.

It was Space Engineers minus clang. It was... fun! But the longer I play, the more you find out that the actual gameplay mechanics are janky, the graphics and animations are janky, and community suggestions are no longer actually listened to, it seems.

There are so many fun mechanics that could be put in place that would breathe fresh air into this game, but no. Let's release a DLC instead for a game that has an unfinished main story, that relies *heavily* on a user-made scenario/mod (Reforged Eden) to be balanced, and that still to this date makes my GPU fan sound like a jet engine. 

And then of course, Funcom's involvement. Even from the press release it's made clear that Empyrion has now entered the age of the DLC; which often comes down to the main game being in maintenance mode, and the DLC's just being the things they should've added in the first place, but now you get to pay for them. 

So. Pass this one by folks, it was fun, as an indie game, but now that ""big publishing"" has stepped in, it'll just be painful to see it crumble.

Probably no coincidence the game is 60% off right now.
Oh, and the DLC, is just a mod (scenario) and can't be used with other mods (Scenarios).

NOTHING about this game is intuitive, to add on to the sh**pile. If you're wondering what to do or how to do it, the in-game PDA is virtually useless; you'd have to defer to someone vaguely explaining it online. What's more - most changes that you HAVE to make in order for the game to be playable is done via manipulating the coding on the server. Like... what? Why?
It's as if the developers have never played a game before. Either that or they're masochists.

For a while I could write off the bugs and rough edges as: it's an ambitious project that inevitably will take a lot of time and play testing to iron out all the kinks and implement all the features the devs want to have, and it's a game that is still technically in development and a small dev team, but after the release of the DLC I firmly believe that there are only possibilities: 1. Sales were too low to continue funding the dev team so they put out a paid DLC to try to bring in some more money to keep working on it. OR 2. The devs just wanted a cash grab. Those are the only two reasons to put out a paid DLC for a game that isn't in a truly finished state and either way it speaks very poorly of the dev team especially when they are locking features that should be base game like MELEE COMBAT behind a paywall. To be clear I like a lot of the aspects of the game, but I am MASSIVELY  disappointed in the dev team.
---Below is my initial review of the game before the release of the DLC, all of the points apply to the game and if you don't mind supporting this kind of dev team then I encourage you to review the pro/con list to decide if this game is for you---
 Pro's: Has lots of room for creativity
The blueprint system (allows you to build ship one world and then gather the required materials in another and perfectly duplicate it without having to mess around with colors, and textures, or placing blocks in just the right way) 
Is still actively being developed (which is both a pro in that bugs typically get fixed and there is more being added to the game periodically, but also a con because there are bugs that pop up here and there and some features do get changed from time to time.)
Cons: In the time I've been playing the game I have encountered multiple bugs that significantly impacted gameplay including multiple bugs that made the game unplayable until a patch came out. 
The game can feel very aimless in multiplayer as it doesn't support questline progression, now if you enjoy just gathering resources, building cool ships, and exploring new places this is fine. 
Some aspects of the game are poorly balanced.
Overall a solid game that is a lot of fun IF you like sandbox survival games, block building ships and bases, or a semi-chill game with occasionally very intense moments. Personally I think the game is best when played with a small group around 3-5 people playing as a team.
There are several POI's that are built in such a way that you can't progress through an area without a member of your beam dying.",1659758122,1708310000,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

========Original Review for posterity (prior to the Funcom sellout insanity)==========
[strike]Like this game so much I now own it on 3 accounts, just because. I don't even actually know how many hours played I have in this game, but I've been playing it for going on 5 years - so it's gotta be pushing 2000 (and it's still in my top 5 favorite games of all time). When I bought it again for this account just now, it occurred to me that I hadn't yet left a review despite getting so much enjoyment out of it, so let's fix that!

If you're seeing a weird proportion of unfavorable reviews from mid-June onward, keep in mind that a major update iteration (1.8) just dropped. Don't know what those people were expecting, but there are always going to be bugs and annoyances after a major release - and I do mean MAJOR. 1.8 is more of an ""overhaul"" than an ""update."" Personally, though, even in 1.8, I've never experienced a single crash or major bug in this game since it left early access - and neither have the friends I play with on a weekly basis. (Then again, we all know how to [i]correctly[/i] configure and operate our PCs, so that might have the tiniest bit to do with it...)

... Speaking of which:
The game IS well-optimized, and performance is exceptional. It even runs great (easily maintains >60fps) at 1080p, with everything maxed, on my backup/LAN-server machine with only a 4th-gen i5, a GTX 770 and a 2nd-gen [b]SATA[/b] SSD. On hardware more modern/capable than that, you'd have to be particularly-incompetent or particularly-determined to create any unexpected & perceivable performance deficit. Bog-standard gaming rules of thumb apply, of course: always disable VSync, only limit framerate [b]outside[/b] the game, always DO set at least some sensible framerate cap, use RTSS for scanline sync if you need it, etc. (Do yourself a big favor and Google a few PC gaming guides for dummies if any of that isn't already second-nature to you).

If you like Space Engineers, No Man's Sky, Avorion, etc., then you'll enjoy this. It has basic mechanics similar to—though deeper, more refined, and frankly just better than—Space Engineers, but with something closer to No Man's Sky's spirit and emphasis on exploration (without the infinite scale, obviously). It manages to walk a fine line between an ""arcade-like space sim"" and a ""survival-building sandbox"" EXCEPTIONALLY well. Now that I think about it, I can't recall offhand any other game that manages to do both without glaring shortcomings; I guess that's another point to Empyrion. 

Basically, this game is what Space Engineers could've been if it had been developed by someone who cared about quality, who possessed some imagination, and who hadn't locked 2/3 of its blocks behind paywalls. ([b]Keen, take notes![/b]) The updates keep on coming, and the game just keeps on getting better - and bigger.

If you haven't played either SE or E-GS but are currently thinking about getting one or both, let me save you a massive headache (and $80): [b][i]get THIS game.[/i][/b]

In Empyrion you get the sandbox, the building, the creative freedom, AND you get a living universe full of interactivity - so the player doesn't have to bear the burden of creating ALL gameplay entirely from scratch. Most sandbox games fail HARD at that last bit, so this game has been a welcome respite from what has become a truly woeful status quo; I genuinely hope aspiring game developers in this or any adjacent genre will learn from its example. 

Even better, Empyrion actually has an ethical, gamer- and consumer-friendly business and development model... contrary to just about every other game in the genre right now. Conan Exiles, Space Engineers, SCUM, you name it - they're ALL going full-evil-capitalist these days, and the ""sandbox"" brand of game development has generally become nothing more than a contest to see how far they can run with as much of our money as they can carry.

This game, on the other hand, [u]isn't[/u] just a game developer going, [i]""Here you go, take these lite-versions of my in-engine development tools and this handful of stock/free assets that I've cobbled loosely together with some spaghetti code, and knock yourselves out. That'll be $40 - oh, and you can expect regular $20 DLCs accompanying minor 'updates' a few times a year, with each containing more low-effort content alongside increasingly-annoying limits to your gameplay if you don't pay up. You're welcome!""[/i] 

There's an actual, bonafide GAME here - developed by somebody who understands the value of a dollar AND who respects the greater social contract.

One of the things I love most about this game is the constant sense of exploration and discovery. Even after thousands of hours, the feeling of venturing into the unknown and charting new territories is incredibly satisfying and never gets old.

The game's crafting system allows for a high level of customization and personalization. One can spend hours upon hours experimenting with different combinations of materials, shapes and upgrades to create the perfect builds for their playstyle.

That being said, the game does have its flaws. The UI can be clunky at times, and game performance (particularly in populated multiplayer) could definitely use some improvement. Additionally, the learning curve for new players can be steep, and it can be easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of content and mechanics to learn.

I had no clue it was released, and scrolling back, released a long time ago.  Now it's apparently making DLC, so to review it as a full game?  It's disgusting and buggy, with gameplay that revolves around combat when the combat is 0-recoil weapons shooting at NPCs that get stuck inside walls (and sometimes shoot through them as a result)

The only good thing about the game is shipbuilding and base building, where you basically ignore the terrible quests and combat system and just make something cool to fly around in for a while.  Of course, once you've built a ship, the only thing to do with it is take it on quests and hope the quests don't require you to get out on foot instead of using your fancy new ship (most of them do)

That said, the base/ship building *is* one of the best in the genre, and you can make some really cool stuff.  But there's nothing to do with it, unless you want to take it into PVP - and then by design, you can't have a cool ship, it needs to be an optimized death cube.

As an example of the game's jank, you can't swim.  If you ever end up in water, you're dead, and all your stuff is probably gone forever, because you sink straight to the bottom but you walk too slow to ever make it out before you run out of oxygen

I loved the concept and had so many ideas of what it would be that i imagined something almost perfect. At that time it was far from perfect, and being an EA title I should have been less critical. They did however state what this game was going to be and I blame that for my over excitement. but many balances and optimizations have been made over the years and after recently coming back I can honestly say this is the greatest space survival game to date. As for space exploration, many of us will know ED is graphically beautiful, expansive, the O.G., but repetitive. This is less graphically beautiful but the layered vehicle use, survival aspects like hunger and medicine, and reliance on crafting and leveling for survival make this the #1 space exploration game to date in my humble opinion. Go from planet to space, or space to planet with no loading screen. All loading is 'mostly' seamless with only a <1s lag on <150 ping servers. Has official servers so if you're a loner type that doesn't like power politics you can totally lone wolf. Vehicles range from 'on foot > motorbike > hover vessel-HV, small vessel-SV, capital vessel-CV. Capital being the largest, and impressively so. CV's have automated weapons at all times so you can completely lone wolf even in big battles as long as you're a decent pilot. Can play on an Eleon Studios Official server without having to team up with anyone, no need to join a private server, or kiss chadmin butt just to not get harassed. If you DO want to join with other players it's quick and easy usually. There are player-made factions (just like guilds, clans, and so on) that love helping new players. You will never run into a dead-end because the player-base and community are so helpful they wont let you go without the advice you need to correct mistakes. Although, they may ask for a trade in return for a favor or a lift if you run outta fuel :P  Honestly can't get enough of Empyrion right now. If you like space games with some technical difficulty, logic strategy, versatility in social aspects, and action on top of it all,  this is it.

Yes, I played it a lot in multiplayer, and used it as a rather relaxing, mind-clearing pastime in single player... and you probably should approach a review from someone with 1200 hours as: ""Opinions on something he likely has extensive knowledge on"" rather than ""Why you play so long if you dislike? lol!""

With that out of the way: I cannot recommend this game for three very specific reasons:

First, the gameplay is, let's be honest, absolute garbage. It hasn't gotten better during the alpha, and after the alpha magically became a final release to eventually begin pumping out useless DLCs (a la Space Engineers...) it got even worse due to the core mechanics never improving one bit as the development progressed. If you want a good game, this ain't it. It's (yes, brace yourself, I'm gonna say the thing) *objectively* a badly designed game, clunky, with horrible mechanics and poorly thought-out and disgustingly ugly UI, not to mention insane system requirements for a game that looks like it came out in 2005.

Do you want to walk on your moving ship or board enemy ships and capture them naturally? Nope, you can't. 
Do you expect decent hitboxes both in space and on land? Denied. 
Decent (or even working) enemy AI? Hah, in your dreams. Everything is, forgive me the use of the word, retarded.
Engaging, fun flight model? No, everything moves awkwardly and in the same exact way, with just different speed caps.
Good camera? Ugh, no. It will freak and spazz out every 2.1 seconds.
Good controls? Nope, unintuitive and clunky.
Engaging exploration? Different colors, same things in each and every system, with player-made ships put in the game with no thought.
Interesting and fun combat? No, DOOM, Descent, Freespace, X-Wing vs Tie Fighter and others literally did it better in the nineties.
Do you want an interesting campaign, cool story and lore? Nope, it's all a mess... with broken quests, awful dialogues and childish writing.

Second, the dev team has clearly shown they are moving in the wrong direction... and at a glacial pace. Instead of focusing on having solid gameplay that isn't completely broken (the game has constant issues with teleporting assets and a plethora of various others rage-inducing bugs) they just added more stuff... and I'm not talking about something that changes the game in a significant way, but just... fluff. New blocks. New textures (which would have still been ugly, even if the game was from 2005.) But the gameplay loop is ALWAYS the same:

-Gather resources with your clunky tools.
-Build a vessel, then a base.
-Attack a POI and loot or scavenge it (Point of Interest, usually defended by stupid AI.)
-Build a capital vessel.
-Maybe attack other capital vessels. (Which are still a mess to loot, and the jankiest experience you could ever find in a post-2000 game.)

There. You reached the end of your journey. Now keep looting POIs and ""explore."" Which is Empyrion's way of saying: ""Mindlessly kill stupid AI, farm POIs for the sake of having more resources or tackle braindead capital vessels who just mindlessly turn to face you while you kill them, and can only defend themselves due to having a lot of turrets. Empyrion is the kind of game that tells you: ""Make your own fun."" Game, I'm here to have fun, you should be the one providing it. I played it 1200 hours just because I don't have anything else to do - don't be like me. Invest your time in something that actually respects your time and your investment, instead of taking you for a ride.

And then there's the attitude of the developer and their choices, the third reason I can't recommend this to anyone. Eleon is a small developer, sure... but that's not an excuse. Not anymore. Not with Valheim, Palworld, Project Zomboid and all those other major titles that cost as much (or less) than Empyrion and are thoroughly enjoyable, with a good gameplay loop and much more content being available on Steam.
This is showcased even better in regard to the recent release of a ""DLC"" for Empyrion called: ""Dark Faction"" which I would say is a fitting name because that's exactly the kind of thing that happened to Empyrion as a product, it joined up with a dark faction (Tencent and Funcom.) They could have added new major mechanics, like walking on a moving spaceship... nope, never going to happen. Better AI... nope. Just a scenario with endless grinding and more reskinned monsters plagued with the same idiotic AI... but they added MELEE combat. Which literally no one has ever wanted or requested. And they of course paywalled the new weapons and mechanics (as bad as they are) due to it being a paid DLC for a game that looks, plays and feels like a beta... or an alpha, even.

So, just don't buy this if you want to support developers who value your time. Don't support devs who put a game out of alpha and Early Access then blatantly keep referring to patches as ""Experimental."" Play Valheim. Play Palworld. Hell, play Minecraft. Just think twice about giving your hard-earned money to people who don't know what the hell they're doing.

But as time went on that charm slowly diminished as everything began feeling repetitive and boring, especially the missions and the barely existent story of the game. I also progressively grew annoyed with the game because of how lackluster and terrible the combat is, with things as basic as crouching only being a recent addition to the game in its nearly decade long existence. The AI in the game is especially is a massive turnoff. Outside of enemies such as spiders, the AI are just aimbots that can kill you within seconds. This issue is especially rage-inducing when you're exploring a POI and an enemy spawns behind you. As a result, I have more and more started avoiding direct combat with the AI, and when I did have to confront the AI I resorted to using commands instead. This is the only game I have ever played where I genuinely just don't want to engage with the combat mechanics, Minecraft has more enjoyable combat than this. Despite my grievances with the game I have continued to play despite its flaws because I still had hopes that eventually one day the game would deal with all of those issues and actually become a finished product. But after I saw that the devs are moving onto DLC despite even the story of the game being incomplete, I gave up entirely. 

So my advice is to just not bother and not let the game entice you otherwise you'll just end up being disappointed in one way or another. This game is never going to be finished and the devs I'm pretty sure barely care anymore and are just trying to milk this as much as possible with DLC, especially now that they're partnered with FUNCOM and by extent Tencent which in of itself is another problem.

For starters, there is nothing else *quite* like Empyrion out there. It has many strengths, and a few weaknesses. I reminisce about the old days of Alpha 6 when I first started playing. Back then things were straight forward...less complicated. POIs didn't have shields, and you didn't either. For better or worse, Shields were introduced, first to players, then immediately after to POIs. I'm not sure if this was a net ""win"" or not.

Mass/Volume and CPU became a thing...A thing I still hate, and I've had ample time to get used to it. Luckily it can be turned off in single player, and Servers can choose to include or dismiss it. I struggled to enjoy and embrace it. I failed. It's very limiting and I like to build *Grand* in a way no other game I've found really has the ability to do. CPU kills that, and mass/volume ensure that your substandard base/craft will be all the harder to build. Luckily there are servers that do actually leave those options ticked off.

Another unwelcome change, was to outdoor spawns..speaking specifically of faction based ground wondering troops...mostly around Zirax strongholds, but also there are some other random others thrown in.  This increases the frustration level of approaching a POI, which is generally also shooting at you with big whopping turrets. 100% frustration, 0% fun. This change has absolutely no redeeming qualities.

We *still* (after years, and years) can't stand up in a moving vessel, disconnects still leave you in one sector and your ship in another..and there are several other really stifling bugs.

It sounds like I'm really ripping Empyrion...but actually, I am not. 

The things I've listed here are the worst bits. Basically everything else about the game is great. 

Nowhere else can you build like you can in Empyrion. With the proper settings you can build extravagant crazy things and then massacre your enemies, or occasionally get massacred. 

There are tons of great mods..and mods often make the game. There are blueprints in the workshop that are true works of art, for those of us not terribly adept and stacking one block on another.

All in all, I still love the game, even for it's faults and flaws. I hope that someday they'll iron out some of the glaring bugs, but with a little knowledge and preparation you can really negate or mitigate most of them. It's worth what you'll pay for it, and I paid full price back when I bought it...a decision I've not yet regretted (Although Alpha 8 brought me close to it haha)",1706667298,1707831531,True,77,5,0.696588516235351563,0,True,False,False

It is so broken and hostile toward the player that it's hard to put into words. I bought this game when it first came out maybe 7 years ago but could only play it for a few hours because it was one of the few games that made me extremely motion sick. I chalked this up to the ~75ms delay between mouse movement and movement registering on the screen. I decided to try it again, and that delay is still there but I found as long as I'm not in tight spaces like mining underground I can deal with it.

More than half of your playtime will be alt-tabbing into Google to try to figure out how to do something. The game is just a big learning curve and offers extremely little help. For example, the game provides you the beginning of a tutorial to show you have to make a basic hover vehicle. It has you make a ""HV Frame A"" and then says it will continue the tutorial once you've placed it down. It doesn't. An hour of Googling later I have this cute little frame with hover engines, an RCS cube, thrusters stuck all over it and it looks like a disasterpiece. Get in the cockpit and it won't power on. It needs a core. Stick a core on and it still won't go. I scoured the controls for some sort of ""engine start"" button and couldn't find anything. I Googled ""how to turn on a vehicle in empyrion"" and eventually stumble on the Wiki list of controls that says to push ""Y"". Ok, fine, now it works.

Here is my condensed playthrough:

I take the hover vehicle and run into a town of people, who give me my first quest. I have to get this guy a list of different food that includes eggs, which as far as I can Google are rare/not available on the first planet/moon. So I build a space ship from a complete template to get over to the desert moon, where eggs exist, and come back to complete this crazy overcomplicated task for just a first mission. The second mission has me hack a console at a comm tower, which fails and seems to permanently softlock the mission. For the remainder of your playthrough, you will see details about this mission stuck in your HUD. That's it for missions.

I fly back to the desert planet to explore and then a drone with a cannon destroys my cockpit after I get out. I destroy the drone, and manage to scrounge up some parts to build a new cockpit. But not before I get a radiation burn - there are some numbers on the right side of the screen that are supposed to tell you how much radiation you're suffering but that's never explained. I Google what to do and you're supposed to take a shower or take an antiradiation pill or something. So I immediately fly back to the starting moon because I think I had a pill back there. Game doesn't tell you that a radiation burn will progress to poisoning and then you die about 5 minutes after getting the initial burn if untreated. My space ship had just entered into the starting planet when I died. I chose to respawn at my last location, which is in the ship. No, it just drops me to fall toward the ground from underneath the ship, which is now stuck half a mile up.

I can see my space ship up in the sky, but no way to reach it. So I head back to base and build another cheap ship so I can fly it up to the stuck ship to get it down. While that's building, I found out I don't have any pills and have to figure out how to make them. Game just says you craft them, but doesn't say how. I looked everywhere - personal constructor, portable constructor, large constructor, food processor, nowhere. Wiki says food processor, so I clicked again and figured out what's going on - you have to click a tab to get to medical products. However, when you walk up to the processor and click it, these tabs don't load the first time. You have to back out and go into the processor again. This seems to happen every time you click on the processor after it's loaded in. OK, whatever.

My new cheap ship is done so I fly it over and land on top of the stuck ship and press ""y"" to turn it off. Wait for things to settle down and get out onto the other ship... only to find that instead of having me get out near the cockpit, it just drops me back down through both ships and falling toward the ground looking up to see both vessels stuck. Alt+F4. Reload and find that, of course it saved at that exact point. Uninstalled.

This seems like a game that could be insanely fun, right up my alley, but at almost every turn it's like you're fighting the brokenness of the game to try and have this fun. I wouldn't have had my time wasted by a broken tutorial system. I wouldn't have Mission 2 stuck on my HUD for eternity because the game softlocked it. I would have made antiradiation pills if the broken UI didn't mislead me, so that I could prevent the radiation poisoning I was not informed about. I could have spawned in from ""my last location"", inside my vessel a half mile up, instead of having to waste more time getting another vessel stuck up there.

And wait, there's DLC for this? Why wouldn't you... playtest the basegame first?

The game has serious issues of performance and physics, plus it has serious bugs.
The developers update the game frequently, but usually to solve some bug they created in the prior update, and so on. Year after year this game just continues with ""updates"", but the heavy problems are not solved: poor performance, por graphics optimization, high RAM consumption, bad animations, dumb AIs, terrible loading times between playfields, server crashes when going between playfields, and so on. 
I'll consider playing this game again when the devs stop putting glitter all over it and solve the real performance problems which make it unplayable for now. But considering the update history of the game, that will probably take a long time.

EDIT: +- 2 years later, gave it another chance. Most of the problems continue. High RAM consumption, horrible performance (I shouldn't have to have 24gb of RAM on my PC to play a simple game, when other games like Warframe run flawlessly) and updates frequently wipe out your entire progress. I'll give it another chance in about 2 years.

I'd recommend picking it up, especially when it goes on sale as often as it does.

-2024 Edit-

This is still a recommend overall, but I feel compelled to give a big caveat since we are well into the development of the game since my initial review.

The developers have released a DLC without finishing some major issues with the base game, which is an obvious red flag this thing could be abandon ware.  

Currently FPS combat has some extreme immersion breaking glitches.  Reload animations are junk (e.g. slide does not rack on a pistol, magazines don't drop, writs clip magically through slide etc), other general weapon animations are awful, weapons have arbitrary ""ranges"" where the bullet magically doesn't exist any more instead of some normal bullet drop  mechanic, and ground combat isn't super balanced (you will need a ton of ammunition for a standard engagement).  

These sound like a lot of complaints to still be an overall recommend, but there are cheap unity assets that could fix most of these issues so It would be one basic update for the developers to address all of these items.  And its probably reasonable to put these things off since its a space sim and most people don't get too much in the weeds on these things.  But if any of these things would bother you be aware they are glaringly obvious when you do any combat as a ""foot soldier"".  

With all of that said about the ""on foot"" combat the hover tanks, dog fighting, and capital ship combat are all very enjoyable.  The space exploration, technology trees, base building mechanics, etc are all very well done, even better if you use the Eden Reforged mod.",1575003255,1707689224,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

All of that, and then they release a DLC that not only offers very little (mostly offering a SP story it seems? ... and when the base game's story is woefully incomplete that kills any interest in any story offered by a DLC, would be willing to bet it's not even half finished)... but also the release of this woefully underwhelming DLC comes with an update to the base game that fundamentally breaks the game for countless players (mostly those running the most popular scenario in the game, which I remind you uses only official methods provided by the company).

The development team have continued to update and support this game years after it's release. While there is still obvious jank, the frequency of this has decreased significantly compared to years ago and the bug fixes with each update prove to further reduce this. The amount of new content that has been added to this game over the last four years alone - at no additional cost - is impressive for an indie studio. While I sympathize with the concerns over this game increasing in monetary commitment to get access to the ""full experience,"" that is yet to be seen if at all with the current state of the DLC. It is fully within the realm of reasonability for Eleon to seek another source of income from their existing playerbase given how little the base game has cost historically. Said DLC is not required to enjoy this game on its own, and nobody is making anyone purchase it. 

The issues I stated in my original review below are still withstanding in the base game today (still grindy from a survival aspect, still some glitches and crashes on occasion), but the improvements are also worth noting. These include improved overall game performance, new graphical updates, addition of DLSS and FSR upscaling, new blocks and assets, new story elements, new faction NPCs, various quality of life improvements such as replacing the motorcycling with the new hoverbike, to name a few.

I will leave my original review below but at the end of the day, I do still recommend this game to anyone who enjoys sandbox survival games, building games, or just wants to try something different. This game is not for everyone, but please look beyond the simple negative reviews before discrediting this game entirely.

------------------------------------------------------
TLDR - EGS is fun if you like being creative and making your own fun, but it's remaining flaws become obvious once you put in more than a few hours (particularly in multiplayer). It can be frustrating at times but is overall an incredibly unique and enjoyable experience like no other.

Empyrion Galactic Survival is definitely an experience. That being said, it might not be for everyone. Having played this game since very close to it's initial debut on Steam in 2015, I can safely say that I have seen this game evolve from one stage to another to the masterpiece of a disaster that it is in it's current ""not-in-early-access"" form. The quality of life changes and balancing changes that have taken place in the last two years of updates have significantly changed how this game plays, in my opinion, for the better. But that being said, It is understandable that some would find many of these changes, such as CPU, Weights and Volumes, and Specialization of Ships to be annoying. In alpha 7, one could conceivably strap 30 gun turrets to a box and call that end-game. Now there is much more work involved in reaching some self-guided end goal. 


If you've gotten this far, the replay-ability of this game is one of it's best assets. If you enjoy making your own fun, by building, mining, grinding, and blowing things up, then the number of hours that can be sunk into this game is far beyond what I have yet managed. But if you require more structure in your gameplay in order to have fun, then you will quickly find this game more frustrating than enjoyable, even if you have someone to help you. 

Although the physics and mechanics of this game stretch the bounds of ""realism,"" at it's core, this is an engineering game. Once you learn how things operate in the Empyrion Galaxy, tackling each and every challenge requires the right machine for the job. That is to say, the right one of many machines for the job. There is no one correct way to accomplish any task. Want to blow everything up in your path? You can do that. Want to be stealthy and avoid enemies? Check. Want to dig a tunnel directly underneath the enemy and take them by surprise? You can do that also. 

All that being said, this ""experience"" is not without its flaws. The online experience in particular features bugs and random issues, ranging from but not limited to terrain assets floating above the ground, player character models appearing way to big or too small, or altogether being missing at times minus the suit flashlight, ships randomly teleporting several meters, ships falling or hovering when they shouldn't once the player exits them, random crashes, the notorious ""quit or continue"" exception, and game crashes and disconnects. There are times when none of these occur, and this combined with having a few friends to play the game at once is where Empyrion really shines. 

In summary, if you enjoy crafting and survival games, and are looking for a spin on the genre featuring guns, beer, ships, and aliens, then I fully recommend Empyrion Galactic Survival.",1623903995,1707577252,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The devs have decided to go the paid DLC route long before getting their base game into a complete enough state to justify the paid DLC.
The base game is full of half implemented features that haven't been worked on in years. 
Still only has partial controller support after many years, with no date at all set on when they will return to it or any of the other half baked features.

Not only that, but the DLC itself was released in such a broken and incomplete state that it was unplayable on release, and still many days later it is riddled with issues (many of which are game breaking). 

The devs took 100% of development staff away from the base game for ""a few months"" by their own words just to get the DLC out, and it was unplayable and incomplete.
Well, now they face many more months working on the DLC with 100% staff just to get it passable to how it should have been on release.
This all adds up to many more months where the base game won't see much if any work, plus they are already obligated to one more DLC plus another unannounced title that they already agreed to with their new partners.
That doesn't leave time to work on the base game despite what their announcement claims.

Ship & base building: Great. Simpler than eg. Space Engineers, but a bit more creative freedom because of that.
Survival elements: Not bad, different planets present different challenges.
Sandbox content: Also not bad, planets to explore, derelicts to salvage, random installations to attack and loot.

These things are bad enough that I always eventually uninstall it and look for something else to play:

Jank: Yes
FPS content: Awful, frustrating. Appalling AI, aimbot enemies, 'lol gotcha' death-traps, and tedious level design.
Quest content: Buggy, seemingly untested in part, often need to resort to console commands to progress.

The game ~desperately~ needs an art pass, and there are still huge holes in the game design that lead to incredibly frustrating play sessions, glitches and general jank everywhere. The screenshots of the DLC assets look dismal. If I didn't know better I'd assume they were buying models off turbosquid.

Also, I have a big issue with the general progression of the game, and so does a lot of the community, as they use a mod to rebalance the whole thing to make an iota of sense. There are, to me, at least two contradictory facts about this game:
- you can't walk on moving vehicles
- you can't macromanage multiple vehicles

So am I a guy? A pilot? Why can I pilot a capital vessel that nobody can exist within? So then am I commander of a fleet? Why am I flying this LITERAL AIRCRAFT CARRIER manually like a biplane? What is the actual intended direction for the players progression? It feels like I'm supposed to manage an increasingly large size of faction as I conquer POI's but that never happens. There are huge gaps in this progression, as well as shallow parts; You start with the objective to survive, and you can cut trees to make a structure, but why would you since you can very easily acquire rock, ore, tech, and concrete in half the time it would take you to build a hut out of wood? I'm not alone here: the progression is so donked most of the community uses a mod that redesigns the whole dang thing. (Project Eden Reforged)

Why would any other player ride along on my CV, unable to do much of anything other than use turrets? Especially when my turrets aim themselves anyway. They'd just pilot their own ship regardless. So what am I playing, at this point? Nomansky pilot game or Everspace RTS? Minecraft or Factorio? I do not know and neither does the game.

I don't hate the game or the developers by any means, but if the question is recommendation, I'd say wait and see before you burn your time away getting plonked by gunfire you can't see or running to retrieve your backpack because you forgot to eat a candy bar once every ten minutes or killed by a monster using a raytrace to calculate melee with the worst animation rig you can imagine seriously it's worse than minecraft assets and those are intentionally lo-fi

2023:

The Arby's of the survival game genre. This game has the meat. It's not exotic meat, but it's a thick-ass roast beef sandwich. Or like a big pulled pork sandwich. Not great looking and not particularly healthy, but a pile of delicious content nonetheless.

Empyrion is a planetary/space survival game that has multiple game modes, a tech tree, leveling, factions and AI, different tiers of equipment, the ability to build three different sizes and types of vehicles, and buildings with a pretty simple to use construction utility. The textures on blocks can be changed for more in-depth aesthetic control. The transition from planet to space is jarring because the different areas are instances, but that's ok because the game makes up for it with lots of things to do. There's lots of different things to do, find, shoot at, build with and collect. This game is really fun for a group of friends. 

The player animations are shit, sometimes the physics wonk out, the combat is not anything special and the flyers don't feel like planes as much as they feel like UFO's. All of the problems this game has are excused by its depth. That said, I didn't think this was gonna be anything worthwhile and wow it is one of my all time favorite survival games. Very good, only getting better. Developers are persistent and constantly develop requested features. Recommended buy.",1509074154,1707498332,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Windows10Pro64 - i5-8600K (6*3.6GHz nooc)- 16GB
This is another eternal early access title that never made it to release

- Terrain is vanishing - never had that before - highly annoying falling to death!
- still mouse is rubber banding much
- Now run against the time. If you dont know zirax come rape your base and kill you!
- still no conveyers, no sorting or such
- still strange shy large constructor (stops working if you look at his container)


-> I had no fun. would not buy again at full price
-> maybe buy on sale if you are really like what is shownt
-> Spsce Engineers made good progress. I will visit that next
------
The gameplay is similar to the many other space build titles, 
like Space engineers, Planet Nomds, etc

* gather resources
* build blocks and devices from it
* make yourself a base
* build vehicles
* explore planet, space
* explore POIs and new planets
* do some storyline fragments

The good:
* It is still in evelopment. V9.2 as of time of review
* supports steam workshop with some really nice models from public
* can be fun when bugs dont crash you (I played it for many fun hours!)

The bad:
* it is still in development (devs seem to have no clear roadmap in feature and timeframe)
* rubber banding mouse is annoying (i5-8600k/16gb!)
* no pipes, no sorter, no modding
* constructor stops working if you look at it
* lots of bugs when you are away from base. 
* some strange game design (eg can name box if in group else not)
* middle class ships can not have turrets and can not mine
* leaving seat in space can easy put you in wall
* unable to exit without saving (autosave on exit).
* often NPCs are stuck in blocks of your base when you return
* plus many, many long standing bugs
* sandbox only, no story (only fragments you can start)
* over sensible devs - any negative feedback from customers will get thread locked

I do not recommend this game.

Looks like the game will be going down hill from here. Partnered up with Funcom so we gonna get DLC, and a battlepass which is great for a survival game.

I really enjoy the building and testing out my creations in a sort of sandbox way. I have not many issues with the graphics but hope to see improvements because I can't max out to 60 Fps like other games. But no stuttering, visual tears or slowdowns and I just turned off a few features I don't like, bloom, fancy clouds (how often do you really look up), and shadows turned down, couple others I forget the names of but I have everything else maxed. The beginning game seems fairly easy and I maxed my character level before leaving the planet, but then I like building things and that is where this really shines, you can make and do a lot of things and play around it is usually on for about $10 and well worth that price for the play you get out of it. Is everything perfect? No, it is a small team after all but they have stuck with it over the years and have provided me with 100's of hours entertainment so far. Give a watch on a lets play by Spanj and you'll get an honest feel for if this is for you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AFTER THIS POINT I ADDRESS ALL THE DRAMA SURROUNDING THE NEGATIVE REVIEW BOMBS BEING HURLED AT GAME
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usually I don't review games very often as they are subjective to a persons preferences and I prefer to watch a few let's plays or brief overview type reviews on youtube to get an overall feel for game play and if it's for me compared to the price I would pay. (Quick aside, the one time I didn't do this and broke my cardinal rule in may years was with Starfield and boy did I suffer for that. $70+ is usually way out of my price range for any game, I can usually freaking wait, I digress) 

So first off I bought this in 2016 for $11 and thought it was pretty good then, learning curve was high and enemy engagement was lame then but it did, like many have said do FPS, BUILD, EXPLORE, unlike many others and better than many others as well. It was better at the time than Space Engineers which did similar things as in building ship and mining but this one ran well on my machine of the time which was top in 2016 and was stuttery  and way poorly optimized. Then again they really are two wildly different games and focuses, this game had a small team while SE had a much larger one and backing. I really did get my money's worth back then and I've gotten far more recently in adding hundreds more hours and exploring all the vastly large amount of improvements. Everything is far better working now and more modern. I maxed level and have not even left the starter planet yet, but then I just like enjoying the ride and building different ships and being creative, with some exploring and fighting things now and again. The building and the freedom is the thing I think that really has held this game together seeing the workshop content is huge and players putting in multiple 1000's of hours. 

Is there room for improvement? Yes, of course. Could they fulfill perfectly the perhaps loftier goals of combining all three genre's in a shorter time to a better degree? Maybe not so much as I read about small starters and they all say it takes far longer than the worst case scenario imagined is, especially if EA spans years instead of months and with time come hardware and software changes and standards as well as major life changes. COVID dare I say? or inflation? BUT considering the small team and how what they did accomplish and persistently keep moving forward with I think they did GREAT compared to many, many other small teams that tried to do far less in scope. 

Now all the negativity and backseat driving about where this small team should go or how they should do it is crazy to me, none of those people squawking would like being talked at or about their personal profession as they speak to the developers. I know people now days think that $1 or even $10 gives them the right to. REALLY?! Go watch a McDonald's line drive up and see all the pure crap that sails out the window to these self same people day after day for far more than a $10er each time! So really if they decide to continue on what is most likely a passion project with the help of Funcom's support you have not the right. If they stopped development now and refused Funcom's help where would you be then? Sad and still screaming probably. I for one thank the developers for their time and efforts and say for a fact they are far greater, kinder and more giving that McDonald's ever has or will be, and throw Disney in there too!

Small teams have it most difficult because they are chasing the technology and improving the game to keep it fresh and appealing and yes they may have not fixed that deeply rooted complex bug that you think is a walk in the park to do w/o breaking anything. Yes the story line is bare bones. But you all have spent 100's if not many 1000's of hours on this, you didn't play it for the story but the creativity of building and trying new things. How really did they fail you to make such a fuss.

So don't come here on steam with hating on the game because reviews are for rating the ""game"" and it's features and express yourself in only that, not make a critical thumbs down because of political reasoning and personal frustrations, go take that to the forums like others do. I only address it here to inform people casually wondering why all the haters have dropped the developer's reputation on Empyrion simply because of a $10-20 entitlement fee that was never in the terms of agreement in the first place. Don't be spiteful, just move on like the McDonald's line does. 

Look up the word slander because seriously people you can't possibly know what the Dev's are thinking so quit assigning motive to them. They love making games and they have worked long and hard to keep this game going while dozens of others fell by the wayside including ""STARFIELD"" which had 100X the people, maybe 1000's, working on it and while it is fairly polished and kinda functioning it costs $70 when I bought it in 2023, and as smooth as that is it doesn't come close, in my opinion, to what the Dev's here accomplished.

Lastly don't get into early access games if you can't stand the way it works, it's a gamble until it is officially released despite the fact that there are warnings to you each time you sign up for one. It's funny like when you try to sue the Iron company for you burning your leg  because you didn't bother to read the warning tags that explicitly say not to iron while wearing the clothes themselves. That has too be the end all considering the had to put THAT on the tag. Think about it, what does that say about you?",1707437386,1707437386,True,5,0,0.503448307514190674,0,True,False,False

I did have a ton of fun with v8, even though it was a buggy mess  that required console commands to get out of some situations. What I consider bad decision making really started with v9. Suddenly they wanted to inject more real world ideas in to a game that is largely an arcade style game. Instead of building upon the fun of that, and smoothing things out, they decided to take the game in a direction that is something like Space Engineers.

For this game to be amazing and fun, all they really have to do is focus on open ended building with ships and bases(instead of the arbitrary and asinine limitations they impose on you), survival, fun diverse points of interest, factions, and a whole lot of world building. Instead, they have started over complicating things and plunging themselves in to development hell, where the road to completion will drag on for 6 years before they suddenly call a broken beta version of the game ""1.0"". We've seen it all before. This is nothing different. Just more carrot on a stick to keep people purchasing the game.

More fun to play some player created scenarios like Reforged Eden and One mans scrap.
I think they are even better than the base game. But there is a reason why I spent so many hours in game:
Good survival and building mechanics, I can build what and (almost) where I want.
The survival mechanics are good enough, hunger, too cold and hot, predators, radioactivity.
As single player I do enjoy a good storyline, the vanilla storyline is ok, but would need more love.
Some planets are interesting, Most don't feel really different from each other of the same type including copy paste POIs etc. I would say, for the price it is a good deal if you don't expect too much, like survival games, scifi, building, mining, fighting with spaceships (ground fighting is there, but dumb AI), laughing about stupid bugs, maybe building a custom scenario would be great. However, it is not an AAA Game Studio and they put a lot of work in this game, depending on your perspective, you could have fun.

The game play and controls have always felt, for lack of a better term, off. Things such as the hover-bike I had hoped to see fixed someday so that turning actually worked properly even going mildly faster than almost a dead stop but the bike even on a good low speed has terrible control. Hell, an elephant can handle better than the bike.

Nothing really changed as far as how the game feels while playing and while things have been added, at some point the old feel of the game remains a reminder that the game is going in no real direction not to mention the graphics overall have remained that of the early 2000's. (Think Thief II and so on). I stopped playing this game because overall it gets boring and nothing really keeps you playing other than tinkering with ship building.

This game in early access had so much potential and at one point was a a fairly unique type of game but the luster has worn so thin that you find the turd under the shiny shell it once was.

I am unsure of the DLC as I do not own it nor do I plan on purchasing it and I highly doubt I will play this game again as nothing concrete was ever fixed nor really updated and so many other games offer much better game-play and eye-candy. If I want some exploration, building, etc.. I will stick with Stationeers (somewhat of a high learning curve), Astroneer, or even Space Engineers. While they are not the exact same gameplay, they offer a lot of similar features, except done properly. There are others, but my purpose isn't to list every game that keeps you drawn in.

Empyirion: Galactic Survival 
3 and a half Stars



Is Empyrion a fun game? If you're the creative type, yes.
Did I get my money's worth? Yes. 
Is the game stable, playable? More or less, yes. 
Am I satisfied with how the development is going? Hell no. 

Empyrion was in the 'alpha/EA' stage for several years, and then it suddenly got pushed through the door and promoted to '1.0' status. This happened so fast that the developers just skipped the 'beta' stage entirely, which is just ridiculous.  I am now convinced that this only happened because they wanted to create the illusion of progress, but I don't think they're fooling the players. 

This is NOT  a finished product, and it shouldn't have  been dubbed 1.0+ yet. This is still very much 'early access' material, in fact, I took an almost 2 year break from playing this game and just started it again recently, and I have to say, not much has changed. 

The physics are still garbage, the animations are clunky,  AI is very basic, combat is unsatisfying and the sound design is just awful. 

Some progress has been made over the past few years to build a more realistic and interesting game world, but Empyrion's universe still feels very lonely and lifeless. Sure, there's tons of creatures roaming the planets, there's enemy spaceships and bases, there are even neutral and friendly npc's, but over my 24+ hour recent campaign, I haven't encountered a single being that I could have had a simple conversation with. Nobody talks to you, nobody acknowledges your presence, unless they're trying to kill you, but even that happens without them ever uttering a word. The entire world just feels dead. 

The heart and soul of this game are the ship and base building features. Building isn't very intuitive and takes a bit of practice to really figure out, but once you're comfortable with it, you can build pretty much anything you feel like. 
It's such a satisfying feeling when you finally take off in a ship you designed and put together yourself, it almost makes up for all of the game's shortcomings. 

I have not been on a public server, and have no intention to ever log on, so I can't comment on that, but if you have at least 1 pal you can play with on a private server,  it can be a whole lot of fun. 
So if you're into survival games and sci-fi stuff, and would love to build your own spaceship, give Empyrion a go. Just don't expect it to be that epic sci-fi adventure you always dreamed of. 
It's more like buying a very versatile LEGO set.",1576661981,1707326928,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

EGS is truly unique and scratches an itch for space travel, exploration, crafting, and more like nothing else I've tried to date.  Of course, Empyrion is not without it's flaws which range from mildly annoying to occasionally game breaking bugs.  That said, it's still absolutely worth a buy.

Let me share some of my own gripes first...
1.  The mission system is well...  Crap.  In terms of core game features, this is probably the worst.  While it does track missions, it's quite minimal in that you can only have 1 active mission at a time.  Additionally, it's really, REALLY easy to break the flow of mission objectives.  The organisation of missions is clunky and just overall missions are more of an after thought for me.
2.  Engine/graphics...  I put these 2 together as I'm no developer so I'm not sure of the engine limitations that might lead to my graphics issues.  The character models are bad, just plain bad.  They are stiff and robotic at best and the faces would need improvement to achieve that.  NPCs stacking on each other and partially appearing through walls is a regular ""feature"".  I imagine an engine replacement would be impractical but I suspect that could go a long way to fixing many of these issues.
3.  Multiplayer is actually pretty good, but...  The issue here is mostly minor such as mining from a ship and getting randomly warped out of your mining hole.  Another annoyance I only seem to notice in MP is occasionally docking an SV inside a CV and it's like you are suddenly in a blender in an earthquake.  Once the shaking stops you might be able to get out and straighten things out but more likely you'll have to use a console command to recover.

Now, while the above may indeed sound bad, this really is a recommendation and positive review.  Suffice to say as laid out above, EGS is not without it's flaws.  However, what it achieves is really incredible.  The freedom to explore a huge galaxy (nothing like NSM of course) can keep you engaged for hours on end.  The vanilla tech tree is pretty expansive and hunting resources for your ship and base builds and upgrades can be virtually endless.  Add to this mods like Reforged Eden and those options increase significantly.  Mods and blueprints bring a whole new world of options to your gameplay.  While joining a multiplayer server does have it's own shortcomings, it does bring with it a whole new level of fun exploring the galaxy and fighting the scum of the universe with friends both new and old.

Don't let the detractors scare you away from this gem.  EGS is absolutely worth getting at full price and for me personally has provided loads of enjoyment over a few years now.  While some may see the recent DLC as a harbinger of bad things to come, I'm holding out hope that this is just another aspect to a fantastic game.",1707321760,1707321760,True,7,0,0.516309380531311035,0,True,False,False

The main reason is the now common play of ""we hear you"" FAQ/statement about the DLC, but not adressing ANY major concerns raised. This trend is too tiresome to ignore. And releasing a side-content DLC while the game is dated and unfinished. I cannot recommend the game anymore.

Update as 7 feb 24, who'd guess the DLC would introduce serious bugs? Also DLC is not discounted...

Since the opinions are very divided and there is a LOT of white-knighting by veterans. If such industry problems concern you, I recommend you reading carefully the comments in Steam, specially in the DLC announcement discussion (locked, ironically) and deciding how much this impacts the reputation of the game. Also read Funcom's own statement for a quite different pitch than Elleon's.

It's a nice game, but it got a huge learning curve and progress isn't as fast as in similar games (like NMS). I'll explain better as I go on. I didn't touch Reforged Eden yet, by the way. Also, it's a complex and lenghty game, so the review needs to be long to make justice to it and to make you well informed.

IMPORTANT: if you want less stress, turn on keep inventory, slow food consumption or disable it, make enemies weaker (they hit hard), disable equipment degradation. It's a single player game, nobody will judge and, even if they do, you shouldn't care.

Pros
+ Detailed, nice realistic features;
+ Lots, lots of freedom;
+ Nice soundtrack and audio output can be changed midgame;
+ Alt+tab doesn't break the game, just avoid doing so when loading or saving and you'll be ok;
+ Different factions with consequences;
+ Blueprint time will display as X minutes or even Y hours. Just sleep in-game for 8 hours. Same on any crafters.
+ Four starting planets, each with their own challenges;
+ You can build your own stuff;
+ Many tools available to make life easier;
+ Pretty, either on planets or IN SPACE;
+ Amazing creators with amazing bases and vessels. From basics, to combat-oriented, utilitarians, case-specific or simply luxury works of art;
+ Performance isn't a considerable issue;
+ Loading times are not bad (SSD);

Cons
- Bad tutorial because it feels like a tutorial, a heavy one at that. A tutorial should be like Portal's. You don't feel like it's a tutorial and even if you do it's light and teaches you what you need to know only when you need it. This game teaches too much too early and doesn't teach things when you need to;
- You can't see the list of devices from the blueprint screen (F2). Create a backup (floppy symbol in ESC menu) before putting in the materials and revert if you didn't like it.
- The quantity of buttons you always need to use makes it impossible to play with a controller;
- Weird quest and tutorial UI, feels cluttered and dated;
- Dated UI overall, but can feel nostalgic so that depends on you;
- Engine feels dated.
- Enemies spawn out of the blue and sometimes in big quantities. And they might spawn just where you are or where you were. I don't agree with this design of sheer quantity and short spawn distance as it feels like a cheap artificial difficulty;
- Enemies have 100% accuracy and apparently never reload, even though player weapons, even the best ones, do have recoil and spread... why? ;
- Healing yourself, even with the right item, can lead to another new desease/problem sometimes;
- Universe is limited, single-player resources are limited unles you use ""wipe"" command (press ' to open the command line and type help wipe);
- Game tries too much to be detailed and realistic, confuses complexity as means to be more entertaining;
- Vehicles (hover vessel and hover bikes) are a clunky pain to drive in planets with many stuff scattered around;
- Lack of upgrades to solar energy and variety of clean energy sources (or even coal and nuclear sources);
- Late tier items are not an upgrade in all terms, since their requirements (energy input, CPU points) also increase heavily. Some other stations are either not useful or very situational, such as the furnace, which, despite it's name, has a limited range items it'll handle;
- Despite the ammount of stuff, there is a lack of ""middle grounds"" or lack of a late-game variant. For example, shields. A lack of smaller, weaker shield while the usual ones are big and consume a lot of energy feels like an oversight that, apparently, some custom scenarions fixed;
- Unbalanced mob damage, lack of personal Halo-like shield. Suit durability affects the damage you take;
- Some crafting can be pointless, while rare chests also give stuff you could easily craft. A looting table revamp could be very nice;
- The more you play, the less advantage there seems to be in playing vanilla VS playing a custom scenario, specially the widely adopted Reforged Eden.

Hints:
! Make frequent backups (floppy symbol on ESC menu);
! If you want to play straight from Reforged Eden or other advanced custom scenario, consider making a vanilla tutorial save to learn the basics first;
! You can use the portable constructor as a infinite (non-logistics) storage for abundant and heavy materials like crushed stones, steel plates, etc;
! Always make a backup before putting items for blueprint crafting;
! Press ' to open the console and type help to see all commands, some like teleport are useful when you or your vessels are stuck;
! Visit the discord and ask around in the general thread or just hang around, people there are cool and helpful :) ;
! Workshop blueprints are usually better than blueprints that come with the game. But some are for Reforged Eden (overhaul mod) or simply outdated. Keep that in mind. Look for people that already made a series of blueprints;
! Remember to use F5 to mine underground or to look about for enemies in turns and crevices;
! While parts like ""Steel/Sathium Plates"" can't be deconstructed, they can be fed directly into your F2 screen to craft vessels and bases. So you can salvage crashed and abandoned places!;
! Remember to save a repair template if you make big changes to your vessels. Upgraded the windshields, cockpit, added more CPU or etc? Hit P and on the main tab, lower left corner save that template for when some pesky small critter hits your hull you won't be bothered forever from a missing or mismatching block.

It feels like the game wants to be bothersome and cluttered by choice. You start the game and there comes a avalanche of things to learn on your way, as you go on, build your base and etc. It still feels weird and it doesn't quite compell you to build your own stuff, I felt more akin to use the base recipies, but seeing how they lacked some important stuff (storage, fridges) I decided to try the workshop, really nice stuff and kind creators there. Helpful community on discord too!

As if complexity is confused with quality or lack of shalowness, which is isn't. But there are some good choices between the meaningless hardships. For example, if you want to rely on solar energy, daytime is much larger near the equator, thus the ratio of day/night time strongly favors your building. Yet, there is a lack of upgrades to solar energy to make it more efficient without needing to cover your base on it, and there are no wind/geothermic/water related clean sources of energy either.

Another thing is that driving a hoverbike or hover vessel (early game vehicles) can be quite annoying if there are many resources about, since it will either make you turn around or even flip your vehicles. Which are meant for transport in the same planet in the first place. A great example is traveling in Akua vs the desert planet.

The spawn system in dungeons is WONKY. Sometimes enemies spawn where you just were, or suddently in front of you in large quantities. Feels like a cheap way to make the game more difficult, and they should be seen from more far away / spawned with greater distance so you can plan yourself.",1700002168,1707319416,False,2,0,0.517959773540496826,0,True,False,False

Sci-fi survival crafting with voxel vessel building topped with space exploration delivered the way Empyrion delivers it is hard to come by, so a paid DLC that's a fraction of a fraction of what other bigger company's ask for should be the least of anyone's concerns.

thanks for the game Eleon, i fucking love it.

EDIT.. :)

couple of notes.. 

enemies are almost always 100% accurate when firing. i attest this to ending up being a positioning factor and deems precise shooting which is (mostly) acquired after multiple attempts. i can compare it do other games where ""practice makes perfect""

that being said,

the spawns are broken. particularly in the XEN radar base, where enemies regularly spawn in the walls and are un-killable but can kill you. VERY frustrating 

the latter makes makes having multiple backup saves essential. lacking them will lead to having to restart or going completely of your way to pick up where you were.

adversely having too many backup saves is annoying and takes a long time to delete, at least on a HDD. its necessary to have them but when youre ready to delete them it becomes a chore.

my biggest upset is there is no melee in vanilla (even after the dlc update which does include melee), but the starter tool does provide short ranged combat immediately upon starting.

8/10 (minus being no melee in vanilla but there is in dlc and general stiffness of most npcs)

the game is hella fun and has a good bit of learning to it which makes it even more enjoyable and addicting. and im still going to buy the dlc when i can afford it :)",1707267036,1707268588,True,5,0,0.441812336444854736,0,True,False,False

The ""DLC"" is now out in this unfinished game and Eleon has opening stated finally that future development will be based off it now making it pretty much forced. Its a clear cash-grab move on their part showing they are taking full direction from Funcom on screwing players over. Avoid at all costs unless you love to throw your money away.

Old review, Over 1,500 hours logged in. As many outside Steam to maintain a stable version of the game due to horrible forced Steam updates. The game itself is about a 7/10 even in its current buggy unfinished state IF you learn how to mod the game and fill in its glaring holes. The team is small, they are working steady if slowly and have not dropped developing the game which is a great positive for this type of game.

However, they are now being funded and supported by Funcom, one of the worst gaming companies in history and thus I cannot recommend this game to anyone. With the announcement comes what is to be expected with Funcom...DLCs. Free development is done. The money grab starts. The game isnt even in a finished state years after ""release"". Tons of content is missing, players have been relying on several scenarios developed by players to actually have anything to do and here we are faced with paid development thanks to a partnership with the massively corrupt Funcom...damn shame.

Anyway, if you plan on learning to mod or rely on players content, the base game may still be worth it. If you are not but ARE willing to be fleeced for a bunch of money for DLCs to fill in what should already be in the game...then buy it.

In short they have over time nerfed the player into the ground and continue to do so, often hiding their design CHOICES behind things like cpu and graphics limits, an example being limiting the number of guns your vehicles can have do to ""performance reasons"".  However they will still leave in POI space ships that i kid you not have hundreds of guns and multiples of all the kinds of blocks you are limited on, including shield generators.... if i haven't convinced you to run away yet how about all of the enemy weapons having a higher range than yours? my favorite of which are dinky laser drones that somehow have literally 1.5 times your artillery range.  Enemy shields recharge sooner and at a higher rate,  enemy turrets will start shooting from a farther distance and have higher rotation speed and better leading on moving targets.  Enemy vessels and structures are not limited to ammo, fuel, cpu limit or rules of any kind.  Roughly half of the in game resources were never implemented other than being bought and sold, and a large number of assets have been removed or given up on by the devs.  This game is no longer in early access and still would barely get a pass from me on early access.  I have years of coding experience and modding under my belt and it took me roughly a week of working on mods most of the day to make this playable and i still am finding more things to fix daily.  If you are seriously comfortable diving into someone elses code and troubleshooting guess and check style then by all means this game is worth the 20 bucks, but only if you are willing to spend like 50-100 hours in their files adjusting things to be decent.

Also you need friends to play with, the POI's are attrocious and the quests are worse than stale white bread, gets a zero for creative dungeons

EDIT as of 2/6/2024:
IT GOT WORSE.... i have been keeping an eye out as i said i would... i don't have the energy to shit on this company as much as it deserves so i'm keepin this edit short. in summary Eleon studios is now under Tencent studios and if you've ever heard that name you know it means the death of even the most beloved franchises.  Immediately they put out a lackluster dlc that thematically is a copy paste of a different 'faction' already in the game.  Imagine fighting grunts in halo and bunjie tries to sell you a dlc for another copy pasta of the flood.... not cool.... even more uncool when the fanbase has been giving list after list of bugfixes that are NEEDED for the game to be playable at any price point. 

Currently the game is on sale for 6$:

- The Ground combat vs Enemy soldiers is just terrible. It feels janky and fighting the enemies just doesn't feel good. Fighting infected legacy is not as bad but it's not much better either. Reloading always seems to create a massive lag spike, new rig or old rig it still happends. Originally I didn't have a problem because I thought it would get better but it didn't.

- While this game is marked as a finished product, the main story is still wip. 3.5 years later from release and the story is not yet finished, yet the devs now are gonna release a DLC which is a new scenario that is not related with the main story. They are also parterning with Tencent's Funcom and Eleon claims that Funcom will run the marketing, the funcom press release states that they are also gonna provide funding for the game. Who do you believe?

- A lot of the assets in the game are from the Unity Asset store such as the Alien Plants pack, Alien Flora pack, Alien Bugs pack, Armored Golem, Base/CV Turrets, Alien Race, Cave Crawler, Dropship, Telluropod and more....

- Lack of end game and end game loot is also a big problem. What's the point of having a unique green star with legacy infested planets when the loot is still the same loot you'll find in the beginning of the game? There needs to be unique weaponery and tools that you find so that you have a reason to go there besides doing the POI's just for the heck of it. 

- As stated this game does not have a a proper end-game. Once you get a good enough ship you pretty much won. The ship combat is not my cup of tea, and when once I tried fighting enemy ships, I found it to be a waste of time. Exploring a large-very large planet is annoying since you have to get 800m close to the POI's for them to tell you what they are. Good luck scanning the whole planet and all the minerals and POI's. To negate this I used to type map on the console and it would reveal the stuff I want.

- Empyrion is also not very well optimized. I found Cyberpunk 2077 and other demanding games to run better than this game unfortunately. The Temperate moon planets run awful with low GPU usage. Sometimes even reaching 70 fps on an RTX 4080 on 1080p resolution!

Positives: There are some good aspects about this game such as building anything you want, a good steam workshop and Reforged Eden mod but that's it really.

TLDR Negatives: The ground combat is terrible, story is still wip, partnered with Funcom (Tencent), unity store assets, no real endgame and the game runs badly because it's not optimized

Pro:
1. Can build space craft and bases.
2. Can build on planets and in space.
3. Survival game (food, temperature, radiation, hostile NPC).
4. Exploration.
5. In active development.
6. Collect and mine resources.
7. Craft food, parts, tools, and weapons.
8. Can save blueprints of your favorite designs.
9. Medical (various conditions & treatments).
10. Creatures have predator/prey interactions.
11. Kept me interested - played thousands of hours offline over many years.

Con:
1. Bad structure logic. Some structures can be destroyed (or taken apart), others can be if the core is removed, others are completely indestructible. No obvious way to tell them apart. The pre alpha was amazing in that all structures could be destroyed or taken apart -- it was the number one thing that stood out to me (was not forced to follow a specific path). Sadly, the game is too rigid now.
2.No voices (only text messages).
3. Need more interesting creatures and NPC (cute, funny, strange, why are you doing that, what just happened).
4. Needs automation (drones or processes to do tasks)
5. No NPC passengers and crew
6. Boring text dialog for story background info. Playing audio in background would be better.
7. Extremely buggy missions - it is so buggy that there is a checkbox to let you skip objectives.
8. Objectives must be done in a certain order, or they can break.
9. Multiple hostiles can spawn next you in a closed space instantly killing you.
10. Difficulty of early missions is too high -- new players should expect to die repeatedly until they figure out the correct order and method of completing objectives.
11. If NPC don't move/attack, then the game has ""crashed"", restart the game.

Summary: Play it. Buggy, but still worth playing. The development is active and some features and game play may not be in the final product. For solo play, this game feels empty compared to Starfield until it adds voices, crew, and passengers.",1535922301,1707080664,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sorry devs, but if you are experts for game development, you should have known what you get into. Have my thumbs down.

The game was lacking before you advertised the DLC. It was innovative when it came out 2015, and great for 3 years after 2016. But ""build a ship and shoot enemies (still poorly implemented Ego-Shooter mechanics), and solve missions (very plain placeholder missions that get boring quickly)"" is not enough if you have...NINE years for development. You got lazy and now you are tired. Ok. But why not listen to the community? Ego-Shooter Mechanics can easily get improved, and the missions could easlily get some love.

old Review from 2016:
Let's first talk about Empyrion as of it now. I spent 26 hours in it since I bought it - 1 week ago. =) I own Starmade like one year and spent 24 hours in it. Empyrion is fun to play as it is right now, for at least 20 hours. That lies in its carefully thought out survival system, that really keeps you challenged as long as you learn the game and set the difficulty to the highest settings. I just recommend to set the ore deposit count per planet high or you have to travel large distances to find every metall you need to progress to tier 2.

Considering what the developers delivered up to now, I have a good feeling that they will be carefull about how to design their game in the future. They will programm a game that will be a game after all and will give you nice space fights and nice space RPG possibilities.

Now I want to give my 2 cents into the ""what space-sandbox will be best for me"" discussion:

So there are several space-sandbox games out there, like Starmade and Space Engineers.

Compared to those 2 Empyrion is the only game of those that might be able to give you, what I hope every player wants: Working space battles 10vs10 with your own built ship.

Why not Starmade? Because the community is too small to gather enough people daily that ALSO agree to fight a 10vs10 within a set of needed build rules like a limitation of the mass or block count.  I take the community size from the count of the reviews compared to Empyrion (right now Starmade has 1.897 since 27. Nov 2014, and Empyrion 4.101 since 5. August 2015: Empyrion has double the review count within 1/4th of its early acces time on steam; Space Engineers has 52.387 right now) and from the player count on the biggest servers there are right now out there for Starmade and Empyrion. But I like Starmade: The dev team is very small so I don't blame them for delivering a small game, and the design aspects you consider building a ship are very fun.

Why not Space Engineers? 10 vs 10 is not possible with their high physics calculation. In 5 years the server and clients might be powerful enough to handle the physics engine, but now they just have a too advanced simulation. Even a 1v1 with a ship that has 10 turrets each you have stuttering - that is NOT how it's done how can any game designer be satisified with this! I don't understand you Space Engineers you have really nice features and combine so many nice ideas! It is not okay: you have the money and the programmers and fail to deliver the easiest design choices after all this time you are on the game.

Empyrion shows the best way for what I want in the game and has the highest possibility to reach my dream compared to the other 2. Empyrion can be there in 1 year, but Starmades Community will not grow that much to make up to the allready bigger community of Empyrion. And Space Engineers is more of a tech demo than a real game for me.",1468670136,1706965424,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Meh... still feels like they didn't work out all the kinks. Still feels early access. Now they're releasing a DLC? And partnering with some micro-transaction company? Doesn't bode well. If you're wondering where all my hours in the game went, it's thanks to modders that made REFORGED EDEN. They turned it into something worth playing in spite of the games obvious limitations. They should have paid them to save their game rather than get some stupid marketing company. Oh well.

Red to Green

UPDATE: 

Alright, I feel pretty good about this game now. They've constantly been improving. They're finally working on their A.I., they got rid of the dumb green wall and the crazy domes at the poles. Creatures are more interesting. It's getting to be a pretty solid PvE experience.

Of course, you're expecting a AAA title with incredible story and cinematics, then you really don't enjoy the concept of ""game"". Ergo, this is not the ""game"" for you.

Only thing I don't like still, and I'm sure they may fix in time, is that the ships flying around in multiplayer are still pretty choppy. It happens in PvE and it's even worse in PvP.

I feel like if they can continue to polish the PvE experience and you can fly off and fight enemies with your friends, this will be a really solid experience. In spite of improvements, A.I. is still pretty stupid, but... baby steps, right? Of course, I'm sure PvP will be great too, but I don't really care about that. I enjoy working with people.

Good job guys. I'm proud of you. I look forward to the day that you put Ark and Space Engineers to shame.

*whispers* can't wait for mechs

=====================================================================
Update: August 11th, 2017

Yeap... not much has changed still. I still like donking around and building stuff but the A.I. is still awful. The lack of diversity in creatures is still lame. Ships flying about on multiplayer are choppy and bad looking. The missions are broken and terrible. BUT it is fun to just build stuff with friends and I like the idea of moving planets. Yeah, I still play it. It's nice to veg out to after a long day of work.

You work REALLY hard to make capital ships and fighters then your buddies get flung out into the cold void of space after a warp jump, your peripheral vessels suddenly can't dock anymore, and all the fanboys cry ""sometimes you just gotta start over"". Nah. You have fun with that.

If you're looking for an adventure, get Ark. If you're looking for beauty and complexity, get Space Engineers. If you're looking for an easy ""build 'em up, break 'em down"" type game... Empyrion is for you.

Dec: 2016

UPDATE: 

It's been a year now since my last review. Guess what? Not much has changed. They added a workshop, which is a smart move on their part, they need the modding community to pull them out of the black hole. They need to let them help with flora and fauna.

It's pretty. New planets. Everything else is the same. Planets are still half a section with a green wall you teleport through back to the other side. No poles still because they haven't figured that out. AI is still stupid. But building and range of things to do is pretty solid. Space Engineers still has them beat on variety and seamless interplanetary travel but that game sucks for its own reasons.

I know it's early access... but ya know... early access FOR YEARS kinda draws its own level of criticism. Also, I see everywhere that the stupid green-teleport-to-other-side-of-planet-because-we-can't-figure-out-how-to-make-globe-maps thing causes players grief when their ship floats through it and you can never retrieve it. Hours wasted on building ships that you lose to bugs. It makes me think their voting system is broken because I don't see why they wouldn't fix a basic function of the game before they started adding bells and whistles...

Anyway... buy them both. Play them both. They're great time killers with friends but I don't think they'll do anything spectacular soon. Like I said in my Space Engineers reviews, I think the guys from Ark should buy Empyrion and Space Engineers and make an amazing game (and learn how to make building in Ark not suck).

I love survival games which is why I burned so many hours on this one... I'd rather play a crappy one than none at all, which is why I guess they all sell because there are so many players like me out there. It's the best we'll ever get.

Everyone has their pros and cons it would seem. Everything is early access and nothing is ever complete.

===============================================
OLD REVIEW from like... years ago...
===============================================

I'd hold off for now. I'd hate to see a repeat of Starforge. 

Right now the planets are round but you're boxed in to a quadrant... so you can't ACTUALLY traverse the whole world. 

Also, you can't travel to other planets unless all players are on the ship with you... so there's no multitasking between worlds.

So far it's pretty interesting and I understand that it's an PRE-Alpha but I'd like to see this thing move past Alpha and hopefully not switch to ""Complete"" in Pre-Alpha like Starforge did. So far, VERY impressive though. Like every failed, early-access game before, I have high hopes for this one... and as always, hope it doesn't actually fail.",1439431823,1706718465,False,1,0,0,13,True,False,True

Construction of bases, vehicles, and space ships along with the tech tree is top notch.   On the other hand, the game has janky NPCs, buggy quests, weak tutorial, and uneven progression.  

My only beef is that the beginner starting moon is too easy (no drone or NPC attacks except a few wild animals) and leaves you unprepared  for the bullet sponge NPCs in the dungeons (some have a LOT).

Addendum:  After putting a few more hours into the game, I would like to add that the game transforms from 'survival' to exploration and dungeon crawling as you advance to interstellar travel.  Unless you restart frequently, you will likely spend more time at this stage. 

Final Notes:  They have a somewhat interesting quest-line they never bothered to finish and haven't touched for over 3 years.  Like I said it's an indy game...

About 200 hrs of my game time are in the vanilla game. This game does very well in the sandbox, exploration, space and building departments. Its jank when it comes to ai, quests, and animations. Luckily IMO the positives greatly outweigh the negatives.

+Sandbox. The way the game is setup allows for true sandbox gameplay. You can do whatever you want as long as you have the means to do it. Even the story mode lets you do whatever you want. Though I recommend doing it first if you’re playing it because you can happen upon objective locations easily and they have no protections from your early arrival so triggers can become messed up.
+Exploration. There are plenty of different planet types to see that have different conditions you must face against. With special planets that have unique properties. Planets have varying points of interest depending on planet type. 
+Space. No traveling between stars and going from space to planet is not seamless, but its extremely close with nothing but a spike of lag that for me lasts about 1-2 seconds. Interestingly enough the planets are flat maps, but many things are taken into account to simulate a true planet. 
+ Building. While a bit confusing at first as it differs from conventional building controls. After a short amount of time i was able to pick up on how it worked and its more than efficient enough (Creative mode could use some more tools).  Otherwise, its your regular block grid-based builder with a large grid and small grid. The wireless system for the handling of inventories and the virtual hotbar is actually a nice way of dealing with storage volume and mass that many similar games have trouble dealing with.

+/- Graphics. Planets, environments and the blocks look great. Many environments are surprisingly picturesque. Some cleanup is needed here and there to fix some oddities. On the other hand, models for animals, enemies and other entities are very rough. In a ""placeholder"" like kind of way. Animations are also the rough for most things involving entities.

+/- Quests. The games main story is actually okay. Its delivery is very awkward as its all just text. It doesn't offer anything new for sci-fi, but its own circumstances where different enough to keep me interested. The major problem is the way its been implemented makes it very glitchy playing through them. Based on my experience. If you’re playing the story follow it through as directly as possible. This is too bad cause many of the levels were quite cool in design. The glitchyness proves to be a distraction and this follows through to the ai.

-AI. The games true weakness that harms the gameplay considerably is the ai. Its entirely inconsistent. Between becoming completely inactive to getting stuck on things and suddenly functioning and instantly destroying you. The only reason this didn't ruin the game for me is that when it works the ai is definitely a threat. Plus, I understand the position the devs are in. Everything in the game is effectively generated at runtime. Thus, I doubt the unity engine has any simple means of being functional in any space it is dropped into. The resources and maybe even the skill may not be available to them.

When you find yourself finished with vanilla there are a couple of mods that greatly extend play-ability with a ton of new variations to experience. The efforts of the mod authors and numerous contributors are a great addition to the game. The hysteria surrounding this game is mostly by disgruntled gamers who think everything should be free and that developing a game is simple and fast (which is erroneous considering there is competition with 100x the resources that can't beat this game). Most games in this type are good at only one thing and fall short on everything else.

Maybe the new business partnership will allow them to address my points below. Generally I like the game. It has a lot of fun mechanics, especially with certain mods, which have more content than the base game but that's another story. It manages to combine the gameplay elements of several genres into one, and is more ambitious than it seems. I play with mods so I can only comment on that but there is lots to see and do, the ship building is fun and rewarding and no other game can quite capture this.


Of course with all these different elements in play, there is jankiness and a lack of polish to the individual systems that power it all, IE sound effects. It's a mishmash of pre canned sounds that are almost comical in quality. Feels very placeholder, which it is. Same with NPC's, mobs and other assets. 

To me this is the more glaring and fixable problem, and a big source of negative criticism, and to me personally one of the biggest sore spots. Seems to be on the bottom of the priority list...trust me they know full well. Makes it feel incomplete, low effort and alpha quality. The main story is also unfinished.

440+ hours into Empyrion and it just keeps getting better. If you're new to the game I suggest you play in creative mode for awhile. There is a premade base, ship, etc and you can get an idea of how things work without getting frustrated, rage quitting and then posting a negative review.

IMO this game has turned into something more like a voxel version of No Man's Sky. It's slow, clunky, and rather boring. Every play-through is always exactly the same and now add Funcom. Funcom is anything but fun and has a terrible reputation!!",1452122699,1706361852,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Now, 8 years later I decided to try it again. My feelings went from boredom to disgust. Playing the Reforged Eden scenario for the first time, I developed organ failure from dehydration attempting to reach a village 5 km away. I went from healthy to death's doorstep from starvation and dehydration within the time it took to walk 5km. Finally, I get to the village with seconds left to live, so I ""stole"" some vegetables from the villagers that were left out in the open. My sentence: DEATH. I get beamed in the head with a log from some hidden harpoon turret in the woods. I decided to try again, so I reloaded the game. I get instantly killed by the villagers again. They were now my sworn enemies for life-over a tomato. 

So, with no chance of progressing the game because the people I need help from are my sworn enemies, I decide to start a new game. I go through the same boring intro again (not blaming the game, the intro is part of the scenario). I follow the waypoint to the village and this time it's on a peninsula. Taking a glance, I would have to walk probably ten kilometers to get to it if I go the long way. There's no way I'll survive that long, so I decide to swim. OOPS, you can't swim in this game, so I sink like a rock. Trapped underwater, I turn around to walk back to shore. NOPE, the water apparently traps you. I press every button to try to swim, jump, or crawl my way out. Apparently I press Z, which DROPS MY MULTI TOOL into the water, which I need to even play the game. Game over.  I could reload, but nah. Why would they design it that way? Why do the devs hate new players so much? So, I turn the game off in absolute disgust. Maybe I'll try it again in 8 years, but for now Empyrion is dead to me. It looks fun. I want to love it, but I really just can't get into it. Survival is boring. The scenario I want to play is lame and broken.

They even blocked me on LinkedIn for trying to reach out to them to get clarification. I have a video documenting what's happened so far.

The developers are actively censoring discussion. I really hate saying that because it sounds so tinfoil-hat but it's true. There's a lot of stuff going on that is incredibly shady.

So, here's the thing: This game is still Early Access. Eleon doesn't want to admit it, but it's true. There are a lot of bugs and general issues that give the clear feeling that this game isn't done. When they left Early Access a couple of years ago, the entire community revolted against that move. They have still technically been working on it, but progress is slow and changes are token at best.

You know how No Man's Sky released in a completely broken state, but has been iterated and improved upon over the years totally for free? It's like that, except Eleon never lied about any planned features. Which, in hindsight, was probably intentional so they could get away with not adding anything of value. It's not that they said they'd do something and then didn't, they just never said they were going to do anything, and no one noticed.

There's still a laundry list of extremely longstanding issues. Rather than fix them, they've chosen to find a publisher, Funcom, and release DLC. Honestly, I'm not the most concerned about that because that's just a symptom, not the root problem. What I'm concerned with is that they still aren't making the changes that the game needs.

 OLDER REVIEWS BELOW

Six months after the last review, with an additional 250 hours played, I 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game.

   Eleon Game Studios has continued to develop this game, and it shows.

 Empyrion is an open world survival game in space... now with a Story (albeit some localization will need to be improved),  Distinct alien factions, a Galaxy to explore now,
revised and updated flight models, and a better sense of progression.

  If you find open world survival 'fun', up until the point where you run out of ideas of things to do, Empyrion now has a lot of missions to help keep you focused.

  I've kept previous reviews so the comments make sense.

===

 This is a second review, 96 hours and several months after the previous one: I have gone from cautioning against this game to cautiously recommending it.

  Empyrion's approach to Open World Space is very approachable, it is easy enough to learn how to make a ship and how to explore other worlds. The only drawbacks are artificial progressions: leveling to unlock technologies before you can use materials you already have and upgrades to equipment that perform the same function but ""better"". That being said though, the visuals are pleasant, and no other open world space game exists with the same ease of access.

  My earlier review soured after updates that simply added steps in the 'early game'. I felt this slowed progress artifically,  essentially 'wasting my time'.
  SINCE THEN, late game 'stuff' has been added; new shapes to craft with, an overhaul of cargo and carrying capacity, and a new flight model that is under work. The game is 'adding new toys' instead of 'road blocks', and I would be remiss if I didn't reassess my opinion.

I've left my old review below, both to give comments some context as well as general courtesy of being honest.
NEW REVIEW
OLD REVIEW

I very much like the premise of this game, an Open World Survival in Space. I will continue to play it from time to time, but for now, I wish to caution others.

The problem with this game is a needlessly implemented 'progression', and the changes from 7 through 8 to 9 illustrate that Eleon Game Studios is adamant about limiting what a player can do at the start so that he can feel pride and accomplishment when he 'unlocks' the 'end game content'.

An open world game should not have recipes locked behind 'experience points'. Gathering the needed ingredients is progression enough, and having played modded Minecraft since at least 2012, I can tell you that if you instead provide a player with plenty of uses with ingredients, -deciding what to do with the first amount of resources procured gives a pleasurable sense of involvement and decision.- ""should I start with Tinkers Construct tools, or try to get a powered Pulverizer from Thermal Expansion first?""

It was frustrating enough to repeatedly attack the same monsters over and over before I 'learned' how to craft my ship with what materials I monotonously mined from the ground. Go to a new server, or experience a significant update to this game, and the process is repeated. Now, with the extra steps of Crafting a pathetic throw away tool that slowly mines from the stones you find scattered about the surface, before you upgrade to a slightly faster digging tool and get to experience the magesty of standing in a hole for 10-20 minutes digging.

A fun game, that was once the approachable alternative to Space Engineers, but now with ever-growing tedium added rather than new things you can play with.",1549484849,1705973088,False,1,0,0,26,True,False,True

Eleon's partnership with Funcom can only result in bad outcomes. Foncom has not had a successful game since 'Anarchy Online'; And Eleon's rampant censorship of anyone trying to speak out about this FACT is getting out of hand. Every topic, every hub comment is being removed, locked, and deleted. 

And all this despite Valve's own rules citing:
""Let customers express their unhappiness. Don't censor; customers know when that's happening.""

Well, we know it. We see it. And the recent reviews are starting to show it. Change your tune Eleon! A dark path lies ahead, and if you continue down it, you will face the same revolt as other companies have faced. Funcom is not to be trusted!

[h1]The original review[/h1]
Think of 7 days to Die, mixed with ARK, and add a splash of Kerbal Space Program and you have Empyrion. It is an exclent game and highly addictave. So addictive is the building in this game, that while building an addon to my base my food requirement (in game) got so low I almost died of starvation. 

[strike]I will say that there are a few things that need a bit of tweeking. Like for example 2 of the ores needed to make any energy weapon (lazer, plasma, and railguns also the advanced fabricators)  can only be mined after you have a capital ship that has a warp drive. Because they are not in or around the 2 starter planets.[/strike] Fixed with one of the reacent patches.

1. The game is laggy and stutters often during gunfights
2. The AI is absolutely terrible and boring. They will either stand there and get shot or make a futile effort to take you down by running around the corner where you are...and then get shot
3. The game is overall empty. There are these huge planets where there will be some factions on it but other than them being there to trade, there's no real meaning to their existence. It gets lonely real quick and to travel to a planet just to see the same POIs/Resources as the last, the same boring AI sitting there for you to either kill or sell/buy with them, the game becomes stale quick. Why bother building a huge decked out ship with weapons? Just to move onto the next planet to bomb the Zirax to hell like you did to them the last planet? What's the point to it all?

The ship building is fantastic. If you have a creative bone you can fall into a pit where you spend hours and hours to design your perfect ship, controlling everything from where the warp shield should be placed to the right textures to make your medical bay look pristine.

There is also a lot to explore with a good number of structures hidden in systems. I also enjoy the combat because a lot of weapons are automatic and you don't have to micromanage every cannon like in other space games. Yet, there are ways to control some weapons to assist you in destroying the enemy if that is your fancy. Overall I find the combat fun.

Downsides of the game are the NPCs, or lack of true ones. You have semi-statues who give quests which feel generically generated, and the stiffness of the NPCs make the world feel lifeless. While there are many structures to find and explore, most feel isolated (even the ones which are supposed to be part of a faction) because any NPCs you find on/in them do not speak to you but just pace around. It is very unfulfilling and makes the world feel emptier than it should be for a game which seems to have a focus on exploration.

TLDR: DLC coming splitting playerbase for no good reason... all of the biggest fans wont mind DLC, but not at the cost of splitting the playerbase, partnering with actual communist company, game is unfinished, buggy and playerbase is dwindling, game's MP success is riding on the work of modders who made Reforged Eden mod and dev dont seem interested in making it any easier for them even though these modders are the only reason this game still has a good following.

i did not want to change my review but the devs have forced my hand.

the playerbase in multiplayer has been dwindling, kept alive by FREE custom multiplayer scenario Reforged Eden mod - something which the developer seems to take completely for granted. 

anyone who enjoys Empyrion is someone who enjoys niche content - it's an unfinished game, full of bugs and glitches you would expect in an alpha game. it is not reasonable to call this game complete or 'released.' this is doubly so when so much of the playerbase and workshop content is for Reforged Eden mod. devs refuse to improve any aspect of the workshop, it's a nightmare to find anything useful on it that actually works with the current version.

the devs have decided to split up this dwindling multiplayer playerbase with their upcoming DLC content. they have made it clear that it is supposed to be single player content, but even so any specific items in the DLC will be able to be used in multiplayer servers, and if they are, then anyone who does not own the DLC will not be able to play. this is an incredibly stupid idea. every other crafting game with DLC still lets you play with your friends if you dont own the special snowflake DLC items.

the devs will say that a multiplayer server own can 'choose' to not use the DLC, and as such, they pretend that they are not the ones splitting the playerbase but rather the server owners. this is very poor logic and not correct. take ownership for your own actions now, Eleon, before it comes back to burn you big time.

the develop should be focusing on completing their campaign, enabling the modders with better tools and game code access to improve scenarios like reforged eden (which was always better than what Eleon could come up with). 

the dev admitted to working on nothing but this DLC for the past while neglecting the base game, which is unfinished and has bugs that are many years old. 

to make matters worse, the dev announced that they are partnering with chinese-communist-controlled Tencent company Funcom: famous for buying devs, halting game development and focusing on extremely high-priced DLCs for the niche community while the game dies its painful death. they said it was just for 'marketing' but Funcom's own announcement explicitly stated FUNDING and marketing. what were the odds that this useless SP DLC nobody asked for, which will also split the MP community, happens to be revealed at the same time as the partnership with Funcom (the DLC-crazy gouger)?

the funny thing is, when the developer promised us that they would NEVER sell cosmetic DLCs and even joked about NEVER giving us cheesy dragon-bone space helmets, i thought to myself, why not? i would pay for cosmetic content it's a great way to support a developer. i wouldnt support them if that meant nobody was allowed to play with me on my server if they didnt buy it though. that would be a downright stupid decision, wouldnt it? the dev have more than turned against their own words with this trash idea.

so, prospective buyers, if you love niche crafting games and can live with all the bugs and crap expected of an alpha-level game, this is a good one - soon to be one with DLC which splits the MP community, with more DLC on the way which will obviously take priority over fixing, completing and improving the base game.

best space game, most fun.
kill aliens, hunt for food, collec vood, make or download ships, attack npc bases, explore space.
get shot down on enemy planet, collect local resources to fix ship and get outta there.
a bazillion planets, cute storylines to follow, epic npc bad guy space ships to get pwned by. 
game is constantly updated lovingly by the devs.

Multiple patches to it and the most basic quests still do not work.  Also you have to know they are there and enable the quest you want to make it active.  Just very crude implementation.

BUT WORSE YET is they joined with Funlesscom, AKA Tenecent the Greedmisters, Killer of once excellent games and purveyors of junk games.  Spend your money elsewhere.  If you do buy it, download the version from just before they added shields and turn off updates, at least it was fun to play then, not so much now, just frustrating.

(Edit: 10-25-2023) Changing back to recommended.  Alot of bugs have been fixed, though the quest system is still wonky,  Changes/additions to the games building system have required a lot of older Workshop Blueprints needing to be reworked as the block names used have changed, not a fun process.  Look up the Console command ReplaceBlocks on the empyrion.fandom.com if you run into this.

(Edit: 1-12-2023) Sadly I can no longer recommend this game that I loved.  It is so broken and getting more so with every update.

Most issues I may have had have been updated out of the game, the new galaxy maps are awesome for instance, the old space maps were really lame.  Spaceship design is even better with more options on block shapes and equipment as well.  And they added shields!

So many devs start off with the lofty goals, then during development start dumbing down much of the mechanics as they run into the engines limitations.  Ohhhh they desire, regardless of what some in the community claim, to give us that game, but Unity just won't let them.  

Cons:  
1.  Speed Limits in space.......  OMG not again... but yes it's another huge let down. (Dev response: Unity/game engine limitation and it's a justifiable concession even though not liked.)
2.  Amazingly you can't leave your seat while in flight in a huge ship...... mind blown on that one.  Has to be some tech reason the devs ran into that kept them from letting this happen...ohhh the woes of Unity. (Dev response: I was right...Unity once again.  Massive creation of lag....everything must be locked in place while moving.)
3.  Always ""on"" roll stabilizer.  OMG not again.  No space feel in this game other than flying a ship with the autobrakes ""off"", but the roll is still magically stabilized.
4. Still no support for mapping controls to devices.  After plugging in a controller I was shocked to see that there is a variable throttle/movement mechanic that you aren't allowed to use unless you use a console controller.  They devs could easily allow these movement axis to be mapped to alternative device... but for some reason they either don't know how or were raised on the consoles, and don't understand a PC gamers need to have options for such things.

What the devs have given the community is a gem of a game (worth $60 IMO), and they are dedicated to continuing to progress it.

Change after change that none of the players have asked for happened in 7.0 (and some in 5.0 and 6.0) and most of them were not met with alot of cheers. Telling the devs they are going in the right direction when they are not has led to far less people playing and buying EGS. The numbers are there for all to see. This game is dying and the current playerbase does not want to admit that.

Much of the current steam forum active playerbase is toxic. Just put an opinion in there that is not flattering to the game and see for yourself. Even when being personally attacked and when they have broken steams rules of conduct the very few fanbois of EGS left still playing are not temp banned by the moderators because they too are rabid and toxic.

[quote]The EGS steam forums have a resident troll that inserts himself wherever he can to disrupt discussions and personally attack it's participants with impunity. The old moderators used to ban him consistently for this but the new ones have yet to place him under a ban.[/quote]

Despite Eleon trying to fix the problem the lag shot bug remains and it is unchanged. Conponents, characters, blocks, and basically everything inside a ship can be shot and destroyed by ANY weapon without first destroying the outer armor shell. It is sort of like how Klingon Polaron torpedoes work against Fereration and other shields in Star Trek.

Character ground combat is still clunky or is made to feel clunky due to the very bad placeholder animations for other characters and NPC fawna and opponents alike.

PvP combat is nigh impossible with more than a few small ships because the game gets far, far too laggy to play otherwise.

[h1]The following is currently being addressed in Alpha 8 Experimental:[/h1]
[quote]Planets are still 2d flat maps. I might be wrong but I think that EGS is the only game that has this ""feature"".
The green zoneline on these 2d maps is a crapshoot. Perhaps you can fly to the other side ok but somewhat rarely you will be thrown to the ground and the ship you were flying will be teleported to the other side of the planet near the opposite zoneline.[/quote]

[h1]The following also currently happens when leaving a playfield and in addition your jetpack is turned off on every playfield transition:[/h1]
[quote]When you get into a vehicle your personal flashlight turns off and you must turn it back on when you step outside the vehicle. This is a pain in the ass when getting on and off the motorcycle quickly. [/quote]

You are thrown out of the first NPC body you try to loot directly after you step out of a vehicle. This is maddeningly aggrivating when hunting for meat in an SV.

[h1]The following seems to have been fixed sometime in Alpha 7:[/h1]
[quote]If you lose connection or the server does while you are flying on a moon/planet you will be trown out of the vehicle and fall to the ground to your death if it was high enough and your ship will stay high up in the sky where it was.[/quote]

You can not trust the released patch notes when they say they have fixed a bug. Often some problems persist after Eleon says they were fixed. Several examples include the lag shot bug, being thrown out of the first corpse you loots inventory after leaving a vehicle, in A8x the base drone attacks never arriving and unharvestable plants.

There are many, many more problems and when I think of them I will add them later. My problem is not with bugs in an alpha version of a game. It is that these bugs and imbalances continue unaddressed and even unacknowledged through many alphas while more buggy content is added. Having played many alpha early access games I would have to say that EGS releases are far more frought with problems than any other alpha early release game that I have played.

I cannot recommend this game in it's curent state. If miracle[b]S[/b] happen then we will see.

As a player that has nearly 6k hours in this game since purchase in 2018, I can say that of all the space survival crafting games out there, this beats them all.
DLC after all this time for $10? You bet, I'll toss more cash at the devs. A 6 man team keeping this going for so long? they deserve the extra loot.

I keep changing my mind about this game. The bugs can be super annoying, but with the reforged galaxy mod, this game is everything I want.

Another change(the fourth I believe) in my review. It is now a solid negative due to their involvement with funcom. There have been bugs in the base game since day one that people have been vocally complaining about. Instead of addressing it, the devs focused on a new DLC. Content, instead of optimisations and fixes.
I've also seen a lot of banning of people and deletion of threads for dubious reasons, which sure, in some cases are warranted. However, the devs are silent in addressing it. Oh and they put out a FAQ addressing questions that no one raised and ignored all the question people needed to hear answers for.

No one asked for DLC content and yet, we have DLC coming.

Everything mentioned in my old reviews is still there as issues after all that time. Now we have DLC content - Instead to make the base game less buggy and to implement decent AI, the devs put time aside to make a DLC content which will be paid. This devs choice made me change my game review to negative.




Edit:  
After more than 500+ hours in game - One advice for the new players >> the save system is iron man like!! You have only one backup save and if you use it it is gone!! With that in mind, the game is lots of fun.

Original Review after couple of hours in: 
The graphic sucks, but if you get past that is not bad game and i can see myself putting couple hundred hours in it. 

Well worth the price.


Post original review - after around 20 hours gameplay:
Very good game and the space looks stunning! The only strange looking things are the humanoids - they look and are animated very, very bad. I cannot stress enough how much this aspect differ from the  rest of the game.. This should get some love from the developers. Probably lots of people are discouraged to play this game  when they try it  and judge the entirety of it by the some of the bad animated stuff - I did that in the beginning.

Devs, please, put some proper HD assets for the bipeds and animate them properly. At this point you have good product, but you will have to make it whole, not just the ships and the game-play, do this and you will have even bigger player base.",1652817449,1705161022,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I say worst because I feel that 7d2d is more refined than this game is.

I'm not going to recommend a good game the devs gave up on, just to throw a DLC in our heads, It's fair it could be that this DLC is so much better than the base game, but then they fail to make a good game. 

If we look at 7d2d it's still in alpha and early access why well it's because the devs don't feel like it's done.  They could just here is the next update and throw a 1.0 on it, and say the game is now out of early access, but is it? No, it would not be completely the same as this game feels.

The main menu feels clunky, and the hud feels frustrating. combat is lacking, AI is bearly there, and the only two things I enjoy are the building and the ability to go to other planets. That is so cool it was like Space Engineer but less complicated. All good things have to end but you don't have to kill it.

It's been 4 years of waiting on glacially slow updates (at least for meaningful ones) and I will admit I've kind of thought about coming back to edit this review to positive. They've even managed to do the supposed impossible and implement basic crouching mechanics, after all! Unfortunately it's still the same old barely playable unoptimized mess but it did seem like they were at least slowly trying to no man's sky the game. I decided to hold off a bit, see how things would go as this is still such a buggy and unfinished blatantly alpha game. But as I'll explain later, Eleon's recent actions have prompted me to update this to be even more negative than before.

So what has changed since I posted? They've added crouching, they've even added some better models and textures for things. More random POIs and stuff, and they've edited the tutorial like 4 or 5 times. Supposed optimizations that I've yet to actually experience too. Oh and they replaced the motorcycle with a hoverbike, which while it moves better requires you to lift off every time you want to.. you know.. actually move, which is somewhat annoying to deal with every time you want to move.

I can't sugar coat this though: The player, ship, and hover vessel movement still feels very raw and tech-demo-ish. In fact the hover bike is the only means of movement in the game that actually feels pretty good, and it's basically useless the second you get an HV or outside of an emergency situation. Don't believe me? If you have the game try rolling your ship in a controlled way. Ships shouldn't handle like an fps camera with awkward rotation increments. And no it isn't because of how I built my ship I've tried long and narrow, short and wide, and I refuse to make a bloody death cube which this game seems to encourage.

On top of this, the base game is so appallingly bad that the vast majority of the community, myself included, can only even enjoy it, when we aren't struggling to even play it atop all the subpar game mechanic implementations, by using the Reforged Eden scenario. This game is only worth playing WITH that scenario, and while you'd think that's a fairly big alarm bell for Eleon they would apparently disagree since instead they think it would be a good move to devote all dev time to a DLC that will have exclusive functionality like melee (carefully read their FAQ about this, it's indeed worded this way in that FAQ), and will probably be soon following in Keen Software's footsteps with Space Engineers and it's endless DLC stream, if what happened to Conan Exiles is anything to go by.

Now all of this is pretty bad, but I honestly was just considering to not touch this review and just move on; treating Empyrion as being on life support. No the thing that really, really has given me the need to update this? Eleon are actively censoring their steam forums (when they aren't ignoring people there) of people talking about the shady things that Funcom (see also: Ten Cent) have done. I always knew the devs were a bit echo-chambery but this is off the scales. If I could down vote this game twice I would, which is a real crying shame as I always thought these devs, even if clearly incompetent and as before mentioned echo-chambery, at least never seemed to be the sort to pull a stunt like this. But no they'll just keep pretending everything is fine and everyone approves of this (see again - the FAQ post, assuming they don't edit it).

Yet another one bites the dust. Stillborn out of early access and now it's become a cash grab on top of it.


== Original Review ==
So here we have yet another permanent early access game where the devs decided to scramble for last second cash by throwing the 1.0 tag on because having an actual beta following an alpha these days is probably racist somehow. We'll see that first-world problem some day to be sure, but for now, let's talk Empyrion!

I do not recommend this game, however you might like it if you can say yes to any of the following questions:

Do you enjoy the standard affair of people having an almost pseudo-religious level of devotion to a game, also known as white knights, who will dog-pile you if you dare to utter any sort of heretical nonsense about broken or entirely missing features? You'll find that here. (And they'll probably be screaming at me in the review comments for having a differing opinion to boot!)

Do you enjoy the aforementioned white knights either screaming at you that you don't have enough time in the game to have an opinion or that you have too much time in the game to have an opinion? You'll love it here!

Do you enjoy placeholder art in 1.0 titles? You'll find that here, with animations to match! All you need to do is walk in third person or even just make a character who will permanently have an expression like they're begging you to end their eternal suffering and you'll get to start that wonderful experience. You'll even get to learn how to stand atop a moving motorcycle whilst running in place!

Do you hate the concept of moving around aboard a moving space ship? Empyrion's got you covered!

Do you hate the idea of even just being able to stand around on a moving space ship? Look no further than Empyrion!

Do you hate the concept of crouching? WELCOME TO THE FUTURE KNOWN AS EMPYRION!

Do you want to experience FPS gameplay that somehow manages to be both technically inferior to doom 1 and make really any of the 10000 clicker simulator games here on Steam feel like the world's greatest and tightest shooters? Yup you'll get that here!

Do you want to experience ship combat that is basically akin to just parking next to a person and hoping your max turret count ship can defeat their max turret count ship before they manage to break something in your doom wedge? Welcome to capital ship combat in Empyrion my friend!

Do you hate the concept of video games and just want yet another virtual lego simulator to add to your collection of thousands? Well look no further because you just found your new favorite lego sandbox game except without the awesome mechanical parts.

Do you hate that your high-powered gaming rig doesn't lag trying to render graphics that look only marginally better than those found on the classic Xbox? I hope you're ready to toast some marshmallows over that system because Empyrion brought the chocolate!

Do you like shallow and empty universes filled with things that have next to no life nor soul to them that you've seen no less than a thousand times on other planets that also all basically look the same as the one you are on now in this massive galaxy? Do you hate the concept of factions with any amount of depth or thought? Empyrion not only has you covered here, it pushes the boundary on managing to take awesome concepts and make them barren and unfinished! Shoot, the second you go past the first planet and moon you've practically seen all the actual gameplay there is!

Do you find the mere thought of water physics to be repugnant? Well here in Empyrion not only are physics generally an after-thought you can even dig a hole at the bottom of an ocean and it will count as outside the water! TAKE THAT GRAVITY!

Do you hate the concept of being able to bind system functions such as deploying your fighter's retracted weapons with a simple hotkey and instead froth at the idea of having to navigate a clearly alpha-tier rough menu just to hit a toggle switch? Well you better watch out or people might think you have rabies with how much you'll be leaking!

Do you want to see a game that manages to have more universe design than Space Engineers yet somehow feel even more empty and unfinished? Well Empyrion may as well be the holy grail!

Do you hate yourself? Want to hate yourself even more? Empyrion will help you there!

In Response to the DLC negativity, from a long time player of Empyrion:

Basically view the new DLC like you view RE, SS, and other Custom Scenarios/Servers out there. 
It's a custom scenario created by the DEVs instead of a Player. 
Has 0 Impact on your Base Game just as the scenarios from community Authors has no impact.

No one is being forced to get this to keep playing the game. 
I for one will buy it as soon as I feasibly can.

OG Review:
(after reading Many Negative Reviews out of Curiosity... You can 100% refute many of the negative claims. Just join the Official Empyrion Discord. You'll see for yourself.)

I have never been part of a work in progress as complete as Empyrion.

It is in a continuous phase of development so it will keep evolving.

This game is like Minecraft on waaaay too many doses of Steroids for any living being to handle. Thankfully, Empyrion is not a living being... or is it?

Solar systems and galaxies available to the player... as long as they work their butts off for the materials to build the vehicles needed for the exploration of the expanse.

An array of NPC factions that interact differently with you that adds depth to this voxel based exploration and survival game. 
Unlike some other survival games they don't just spawn you in the middle of a randomly generated world and give no guidance...
You are a survivor of a downed human vessel stranded on an alien world. 

You have a tutorial that walks you thru the basics while pulling you thru story of what happened to you and where you came from.

Everything is removable by the player.. unless a server owner made admin buildings you cannot destroy or implemented ""no Griefing"" zones where you can't build. 

Once you've gained an understanding of the In Depth crafting system and UI management you will be ready to advance to orbit, land on the moon, establish a supply route from moon to planet... then warp to other nearby planets you can SEE in the sky of your origination planet.

Seriously.. if I were to continue on... you would say TLR... already some of you have.

It's almost a decade. The base game is pretty much in the same state as it was back then. The community content is tailored either for single player content or pvp. There is very little content in these community scenario's that work as intended. Yes, I'm talking about Eden before the white knights start frothing at the mouth to say something like ""Tell me you haven't played eden without telling me."" 

These scenario's are no better than the emptiness of the base game. Yes they have quests but htey are so badly documented and when you search for them on reddit everyone's being secretive. Not every quest is in your pda. The ones that are ? They are bland as hell and have things like ""warp to 3 systems, then another 3, then another 3, then another 3, then another 3, etc."" Nothing but warping no content just a sentence or two. 
then there's a quest that is ""Mine 5,000 alien blocks, player placed don't count."" 

I understand the people working on this both dev and modders put a lot of hours into it but all of this is just a testament to the don'ts of gaming over the years. No one likes a bland ""Go to X, y ,z"" kill/gather 10, 50, 500, 5000"" quests. That is bad design and just filler. 

Ground combat is just either teleporting mobs, jittering/wiggling sliding mobs or don't move at all and stand in place. Armor doesn't seem to matter at all. As everything just covers you in status effects. Yes you can use 10min medical buffs but you need to basically devout your hot bar to food, stims, and heals. Theres no resistance besides using a a stim that turns it off for 10mins. 

Space combat is AI just knows and targets your core. Countering that later on is just a battle of shields and run away. Which at that point there is no difficulty as you are just immune as long as you have shields. 

This game is still Alpha and should be labeled Early Access. I don't care what bizarre definition the devs want to use. The amount of content, mob behavior, etc is not that of a finished version 1.0 game. 

I can't recommended this to anyone as it doesn't seem like the game will ever be fleshed out and will depend on the community to finish it much like Bethesda does.

Even given a 2018 release, placeholder text remained throughout the interface. I tried to decipher the mess using many google searches. It was a useless chore. The game had made so many 90-degree turns, no information online was current.

Now, apparently the game and its developer are part and parcel to Tencent and Funcom.

As of mid-January 2024, announced a DLC for $10 that adds a new mission and enemy to the game. The new enemy looks exactly the same as the existing game's arch-enemy and that story-line remains unfinished.

Some questions that will get your post deleted/hidden on the game's public discussion by the game's marketing moderators...

You never finished the game's tutorial, missions, or main campaign. Those features are left partial and unfinished. Will they be completed given there is a DLC now with ""new"" content?

What role does Funcom/Tencent play in any future payment systems? Are micro-transactions and pay-to-play planned?

Without a purchased DLC, how can players continue to play on servers that support the DLC?

Are any free features, fixes, or improvements planned with the February release of the DLC? The game has an enormous backlog of glaring, game breaking issues. So other than a half-baked DLC story, was anything else fixed? or even planned?

No answers to honest questions to those who have backed this game since 2018 and before. Censorship reigns supreme on the game's Steam discussion threads.

Also, do not go near Empyrion's own forums. I did not join myself, but I did read many posts in my search for answers. The game's site seemed to harbor a zealot community of salty, old (60-something?) die-hard, fans. Asking about or pointing to significant game issues would get you double barrel hate mail from their AOL accounts.

Previously I would've recommended it. (with caveats)
Now I'll say stay away.
4300 hours and I've finally accepted that this game is and will always be bad. 

It's pretty simple, really.

This game has so much stuff that no other games have all together, but none of that matters 'cause you'll be fighting the game mechanics and scratching your head more often than not.


What it is:
Empyrion is pretty much what the store page says it is. Yes, a full galaxy to explore, yes you can build pretty much anything. Yes, there's survival, exploration, combat. The main thing this game boasts over others like it is that it actually has something to do. You can attack enemy ships or bases, either with vehicles, on foot, or a combination of whatever. This game checks all boxes.

What it isn't:
Finished.

NMS this ain't. Hello Games redeemed their trash-quality launch by actually finishing the game they promised. Eleon hasn't even made the attempt.

This game is barely more than a proof-of-concept.
None of its systems are balanced in any capacity. You can cheese the entire game with a ship armed with basic turrets built from the resources you can find on the starter planet. Minigun turrets on a capital vessel will eat up enemy shields and defenses with ease. Just tank damage from bases with your shield and pull back when it gets low so you can recharge. You'll kill everything on a planet without taking any damage to the ship itself.

Another example is the handheld weapons. They did a re-balance last year when adding new weapons, and everything is worse. It was bad before, but now it's hard to call it playable. The basic shotgun you can have in 20 minutes does more damage than an epic shotgun found only in the most difficult locations to loot. Weapons like the SMG literally take multiple mags to kill basic enemies, you might as well try to tickle stronger mobs. Ground enemies can melee from 3 - 15 meters beyond their actual model, and this is exacerbated in a multiplayer environment.

Debuffs such as infections, wounds, poisons, are all there too. But you end up catching 1 - 4 alien diseases about every other time you get hit in melee. These debuffs end up draining your food so quick that by the time you open the menu to apply remedies, you'll be starving. There's no way to prevent this other than just don't go near enemies at all. Enemies all have tons of health, and ranged enemies are mostly hitscan with (yes, not even joking) 100% perfect accuracy, meaning if they see you, you WILL be hit. This will degrade even epic armor (the most rare item in the game) so quickly that you'll need to either repair the armor or replace it 2 - 3 times if you fight through the interior of most enemy bases. And when armor degrades, incoming damage is multiplied, meaning you'll be getting one-shot by basic enemies after about 30 minutes of fighting.

Vehicles are unbalanced, leaving small vessels and hover vessels completely useless except cheap, early-game transport. An example of this is the rockets on the hover vessel. They take 46 rockets to kill the weakest turret on any base. But even a minigun turret can kill them in just a couple hits. Any other rocket turrets will kill HV rockets in a single hit. Lasers on an SV? Nope, those take almost two full minutes and 2000 rounds to kill a shield on a base. Trust me, I tested this stuff out extensively.

The economy is a joke. There's no trade runs to be had. You can literally buy materials from one trader, then sell them to the guy standing 5 meters to the side and make millions of credits.  This one is crazy to me because I went into the config files and fixed this myself, then sent it to one of the devs. They actually added my fix to the official server for one season (6 months, more or less) then reverted the fix and made it 100x worse by letting you buy in quantities of thousands, not hundreds.

The devs don't play their game and it shows. I challenge anyone to record a couple hours of uninterrupted normal gameplay, and not encounter some bug or imbalance that would have any other game hauled back into QA.

The store page says released in 2020 but the game actually hit early access in about 2016.  The devs have added to the game steadily the entire time, which sounds good. But when you discover they just keep adding trivial nonsense and implementing more bugs than they fix, you realize the slow trickle of updates is a detriment, not a selling point.

The one saving grace for this game WOULD be the community. Workshop creations abound and are amazing. Total overhauls of game balance, ships, bases, everything. 
Problem is the devs have done such a laughable job at exploring the potential of the game that two users have made a scenario (overhaul mod, basically) which is actually more popular than the base game itself. 

This has made the devs really salty, and rather than rise to the challenge, they hand out warnings, infractions, and bans for even passively mentioning Reforged Eden in any official channel except the one designated to RE. The RE community is welcoming and helpful, but the vanilla game community is elitist and often hostile. This is headed up by the main community manager from the dev team.

The community manager is, in no uncertain terms, a jerk. He doesn't play the game, and is generally rude and abrasive to ever user that doesn't brown-nose him. The biggest problem with that is most users which need his help will be coming with frustrations caused by the above-mention plethora of game issues. But he won't help users who aren't polite to him, and will instead mistreat them publicly. Instead of actually moderating or reasonably engaging with the community, he sets up word filters and community restrictions which have actually banned normal users for saying normal things, not breaking any rules. I myself was banned from the official discord for asking what rule I broke when a message of mine was deleted. I never got an answer, just a ban. I tried to appeal, or even get an answer on what rule I broke, but the entire dev team has ghosted me.

So the only hope for this game was to let the community help fix the broken shambles of this game. Most of the ships and bases in the game are user-created already. But with the way the devs run their community, there's no hope of it ever being fixed. So that's where I had to just give up.

4300 hours. Trust me, I did everything there is to do. 
I won't lie, I did have fun at times. But if I think about it, I mostly just accepted workarounds to the game's major issues. There are bugs in this game that have been around for 6 - 7 years and have not been fixed, nor will ever be. This game should never have left early access. There are actual student projects and single-person devs which have produced far superior quality than this, so there's no excuse even if Eleon is a small dev team. 

I mean, hell, the main story missions have not even been completed in all this time.
Funny thing that the devs are now SELLING DLC for the game before even finishing the main story.

TL;DR: wasted potential. And it's sad because it had massive potential. No other game on the market offers the insane list of features this game does. But here, none of those features work properly.

The developer has partnered with Tencent (via funcom) and this is horrible;
The earlier fallout is Taelyn (the lone dev?) banning anyone who is negative or critical about the game, to the extent where many people are now afraid to provide any feedback out of fear for the possible consequences.

The current fallout is that there is now a DLC that will unbalance the game, disadvantaging anyone not paying money.

The future fallout is, without a doubt, that this game becomes pay-to-win. This has always happened with any game developer that has partnered with the Devil that funcom, tencent, the Chinese Communist party who owns tencent, are.





Update oct 22: 2023:

I'd want to say that I can neither upvote nor downvote this game; that's true. However, given this is the only space sim game I still play, or want to play. I guess it's the only one that deserves an upvote. Space Engineers, Avorion, Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous have all failed me, and are games I will likely never again touch.

Update 6th august 2022: I just had a ship I can completely scrap because the dev broke (for the 32rd time in a row) functionality that requires a hotfix. This makes the game unplayable with my ship. Words cannot express my frustration, I spent a week designing my ship and now I can't play with it.


They really NEED TO LEARN HOW TO TEST THEIR CODE. They need a regression test/scenario to quickly test things. I highly recommend you avoid this game unless you enjoy running into bug/technical issues/design issues. 

Update April: 2022:
Why are there still so many stupid problems and bugs in this game? It Could be great, but there are many frustrations the dev should address.

This game has the potential to be great but the developer needs to get his ACT TOGETHER.
Explorer tokens is a HORRIBLE system. Lose them? you will never possess an epic drive or teleporter. Some systems may be unreachable. For ever. You can not get them back.

Teleporting on multiplayer to stations you sometimes freezes, and you end up high in the polar atmosphere. THe dev doesn't know why. This strands people in the middle of nowhere.

Some of the music is sooo bad it sounds like a repeating 90's space ringtone.

The default 'scenario'/enemies/factions are deeply unbalanced and uninteresting and make the game feel quite asset-flipped. Again, this is deeply unfortunate. Making the Invader versus defender scenario the default for playing should be considered. Even then, improvements are possible.

Chat closes when you change 'battlefields'. Poles should wrap around better. 

Another bug is that you can get stuck with an unusable ship on multiplayer if you remove the core, or if that gets destroyed near a Point of Interest, Resource, Polar region, or where east and west wrap around, or too close to planet orbit. (That is 5 different places a ship can never be restored if it somehow is damaged.)

A new or returning player to Empyrion will nget stuck immediately, being unable to build a constructor in the beginning.. because it now needs to be unlocked. It is nice to 'introduce' people to the concept of unlocking things, but the old 'robinson' tutorial was quite a lot better, as it introduced you to things .",1494012103,1704999433,False,1,0,0.506578981876373291,0,True,False,False

I still recommend this game to people who like these types of games regardless of what is posted below but those are the things I personally was bugged by that I feel should be in the game or changed.

- Lack of need for water/heat/cooling in a survival game, in space, where food/oxygen are relevant. (After you establish a base or simply get some armor heat/cold, minus extremes, is no longer relevant)

- There is only one way to produce oxygen and water and it requires being normally placed on regular terrain which means you can't put it into a base or on a base tile.  

- NPC AI really needs work, in some areas you can walk up to hostile NPCs and unload a magazine or two on them without any retaliation at all.

- DMG on weapons need to be redone most are under powered and you will find yourself using a magazine to kill a single enemy  

- Even with it being ""space"" there are still a limited number of different planets you will come across. Most will look the same regardless of the sun color.  (Ocean planets always have a red/orange tint to the atmosphere; Temperate planets always have a yellow/white tint to them; Alien planets are always green; etc etc) 

- There are only a few armors to equip in the game and are used throughout its entirety, you can add things to them to make them better but those are limited as well.  

- You cap out at level 25 (not that levels provide anything more then Tech access) but I thought it would have gone higher.  TBH I was at level cap before I left my starter system.

-  There are a number of bugs with the game most frequent I've come across is quests either not being able to be finished or not progressing.

- After leaving the Zirax territory defending your base is pointless other then some sentry turrets to deal with trash mobs that spawn around.  There aren't any base attacks outside the Zirax, even though there are a number of factions that are hostile towards you.  

- Base building is fun but has its major limitations; the NPC's you can buy and in theory place are 100% useless other then for decoration. You can't interact with them, they don't wander, they don't do anything.   The NPC spawner used in creative mode at least allows for wandering NPCs as well as some other things but the draw back there is you still can't set up a shop in your base in survival mode.

- Some things with base building in the game require you to go into GM mode to change/edit them IE: Teleporters 

- Most loot is the same from all mobs some things will have a slight difference to them but you dont ever need to ""farm"" mobs to get anything in the game.  

- Food expiring can be annoying especially when you accidently switch the power off to the base for a second and your ""fridge"" loses power, all food that was in that fridge is now waste if its experation timer is at 0.  The fridge doesn't stop the timer from counting down it only prevents the food from spoiling.  There should be either a timer on the fridge that when it runs out then the food spoils or the expiration timer on the food should stop while inside the fridge not count down to 0. 

- Can't build underwater at the moment and no ships can currently go underwater without being fully submerged and the interior being filled with water.  There are POI's that spawn in ""Deep Ocean"" and the only way to explore them is to swim around.  

- Limitations on vehicle speeds based on type HV,SV,CV and whether you are in space or not.  Putting 10x of the best engine in the game will not allow you to go past the limit it will only affect how fast you reach top speed. 

- HP/Stamina/Food never increase and there is currently no way to increase them

- Recovery Items (Food/Medical) need to do more in terms of how much they recover.  Food you generally have to eat multiple items to fill hunger even if its 1/2 full.  HP recovery items are all the same 250hp healing over a short period of time.

These are all design decisions the Devs stubbornly stand by, and refuse to change, despite the players wanting it done. Now they are pairing up with Funcom, and pushing DLC for a game that is not even finished.

Worse yet, they are now stopping any dissenting views from being expressed in discussions.

However, I cannot recommend this game to anyone else, because it is 100%, for sure, definitively still in Early Access. The quality of bug control and smoothness is this game is early Beta, at best. While the game is loads of fun, has ENORMOUS potential, and has sucked hundreds of hours of my boredom away, calling it a fully released and completed game is optimistic to the point of insanity. You will experience bugs. They will be omnipresent, pervasive, and consistent. They will kill you, they will annoy you, they will cost you HOURS of work in game, and every once in a while, they will ruin your entire playthrough. If you are not okay with workarounds and adapting to unnatural nonsense, do NOT spend money on this game for a while. It has the potential to be one of the greatest Survival/Crafting games ever made, but until Eleon can get together a team that starts working through the incredible amount of bugs, I can only give it a 3/5. This game is your weird uncle's 240Z that's been in his garage for 9 years. Beautiful, full of potential, beloved, and completely and utterly busted.

Update:

Well, I've played a bit more than at the time of my original review, and there's a new DLC coming out, so maybe some updated info would be helpful. Since the time of my review, I fell utterly in love with both the building aspects of the game, as well as the incredible mod/scenario Reforged Eden. These two things in combination kept me logged in for well over a thousand additional hours, enjoying being creative and exploring space in a huge galaxy. The exploration, diversity, and beauty of flying around a custom built spaceship is such a pleasure, and I seriously haven't felt that in other games like Avorion, Space Engineers, or No Man's Sky. 

The problem is (still) that the first person aspects of the game are solidly stuck in the early 2000's. The hitboxes are deplorable, the unit physics are unreliable at best and game breaking at worst, the unit models (and projectiles!) are constantly clipping through walls and doors, and the AI has abysmal pathing and tactics. Even the newly added damage direction indicator makes no sense, and rarely points in the direction of incoming fire. Going through a POI to get loot is a chore in the best circumstances, and will exercise your patience every single time. Any time you get out of your pilot seat, you can look forward to combat that feel like it was made in a Unity Game Jam over a weekend, and it's been this way for years and years and years.

Don't get me wrong, the devs are actively working on improving the game, and have made some incredible changes. If you're not looking for the insane, million dollar budget graphics of a AAA game, E:GS is absolutely beautiful in its own way, especially with the consistent updates to terrain, NPCs, vehicles, and other models. The addition of crouching and hoverbikes in particular are highlights of Eleon listening to their community and putting in the work to answer some of the more egregious problems in the game's feel, especially early game.

With the new DLC they have teased mostly first person content, including melee weapons, and that makes me so nervous. Stacking new features and content onto the shakiest part of your game is the most guaranteed way to make it collapse, and without a serious overhaul to the main mechanics on a micro scale, it's going to be really difficult to create engaging combat with any new guns or baddies. Maybe the DLC will come with exactly that overhaul, and I'll be sucked into another 1800 hours of playing, but based on the complete lack of attention to this portion of the game, I seriously doubt it.",1625789194,1704965093,False,12,1,0.53561091423034668,0,True,False,False

Funcom/Tencent killed Conan Exiles with Battlepass and over monetization. It made me cry, but what can you do? Nothing really!

I LOVED Conan Exiles up to that point in time. It's still one of my top three all time favorite games! I bought ALL the paid DLC's! I paid the price of the base game plus the ~$200 worth of DLC content prior to the Battlepass subscriptions, and I still consider it money well spent. I loved it all! 

But enough is enough! I paid more than my fair share for a single game to the devs/publisher! Greed is an ugly beast, and Funcom/Tencent will release the Kraken of monetization no doubt. After they started with the Battlepass nonsense on CE, I decided to walk away with some really great memories and I never looked back. I never did play Conan on PC/Steam, but I did enjoy over 3,000 hrs. on XB1. Good times! 

Empyrion isn't even in the same league with CE, so just to be clear I'm not suggesting these two games are equal, but I also have no intention of paying a dime more for Empyrion either. 

Yes, I've enjoyed nearly 200 hrs. of fun with this game, but in all honesty it isn't a ""stand out"" game. It's just another unfinished game that's not likely to improve after 8 years in Early Access, and paying for DLC or Battlepass is out of the question. Full stop. 

If none of this discourages you, then be my guest and perhaps buy it on sale. I don't really care.

To be fair, I did enjoy Empyrion more than Space Engineers, but this game still feels very much unfinished.

I still massively enjoy the space survival kind of games and just browsing the workshop makes me feel like a little boy in a Lego store.

This game is far from perfect, but if space survival is your thing, with interesting POI looting, some fighting, ship building and steering. You can assume any role you can imagine for your playthrough which actually makes this game incredibly versatile.

Now I'm a lazy person, so i just let my old review sit at the bottom of this. I recommend this game to you now, after several things have been patched that annoyed me the most and then some. 

You can actually flatten trees now, as you are driving against them with enough mass! This is just a small detail but it shows that the team behind it is dedicated. If anything, i would compare this game to 7 days to die. They are both a whole lot of fun with a steep learning curve. The rush of finding new stuff while spelunking in an alien POI is just amazing. Got enough ressources to build a blueprint Tie-Fighter? You got it! There is a whole host of amazing parts to this game, that make it unique. 

Yeah its still very poorly optimised, but the graphics look neat enough.

So all in all, see most of my gripes in the following text and know, that most of em have been addressed! (WELL DONE GUYS!)

_________________________________________________________


I don't really write reviews very often, but this game... i really want to like it. It could offer such amazing gameplay, alone or with friends, but in the end, lets you down when it comes to AI, buggy ground clutter and a survival aspect (looking at you parasites) that is just too much to handle.

The AI is basially always using aimbot, so as long as it isn't a projectile weapon (rockets etc.) it will automatically hit you. This is probably because they didn't bother to actually programm a proper AI. You can cheese this, but it feels wrong doing so. Oh, and you can't look down straight. So when you are on top of an elevator shaft and enemies auto-aim-shot you all the way from the bottom, you can't even return fire.

The same kind of design comes with Zirax bases. These bases are littered with laser and plasma turrets, firing an endless barrage of hot death into your direction. One hit: sure no biggie, 5 hits? Well there goes your cockpit. Oh and its usually more than 4 turrets per building. So even with the most hardened steel the game has to offer, you will be shot down immediately. You CAN circumvent and cheese the whole ordeal by simply digging a tunnel to get to the base, but after your third base of doing this, it gets old... and i enjoy this game for the steam workshop and the myriad designs of ships and bases.

Now you could argue: use a hovercraft vessel (HV). Problem here is the poor collision with ground clutter and trees. You try to dodge the oncoming, afforementioned barrage of heated plasma, but then you get stuck to a dead tree sticking out of nowhere... i was just piloting a 24 ton tank and a tiny stick got me busted. You can't always set yourself free from those obstacles as your collision detection makes you literally wrap around the obstacle.

How's crafting? Quite nice, and the amount of different planets, ships, blueprints and whatnot, it's all there and it is very nice, albeit a bit rough around the edges.

This is an Alpha Version that has been an Alpha for almost half a decade and i've been playing since 2018. Many things have been added, many bugs have not. 

I come back to this game ever so often, start a nice base, get things going and then get frustrated by how little has changed.

So as the current state of the game, i will only recommend this to the most hardcore fans of space survival. For everyone else: Wait for the BETA! or even (if that ever happens) the full game.

Empyrion now has paid DLC. Even better, EGS has partnered with the Tencent-owned Funcom for ""marketing."" The announcement thread attracted criticism and was, of course, locked.

Shills insist this unholy union can't possibly result in monetization like battle passes and microtransactions, because ... come on, guys ... Empyrion isn't even the type of game that can work with a battle pass. Neither was Conan Exiles, but uh ... never mind. Oh, and concerns about spyware from a Chinese-owned corporate arm of the CCP are, like, totally unfounded conspiracy theories.

It's funny that this new DLC features ""updated melee combat"" with swords (which I'm sure will be brilliantly animated and have nothing to do with Eleon's new partnership with the maker of Conan Exiles). Meanwhile, awful gunplay and movement don't even get mentioned. Instead, we're told Funcom grants the ""opportunity to raise the bar for both the quality and quantity of our content.""

What that means is anybody's guess, but something like Zirax Coins, a Galactic Emporium and a Galaxy Pass wouldn't surprise me.

I'm out of space, so this is probably the final update. Buyer beware.

UPDATE (July 2022, v1.8):

After not playing Empyrion since posting this review (nearly 2 years ago), I recently reinstalled and clocked just under 30 additional hours. Nothing I originally wrote here warrants revision, and I still don't recommend the game to anyone seeking ""galactic survival,"" but I tried to give the current version a fair shake.

* Some of the graphic changes result in a game universe that's downright beautiful at times. The gas giant's rings, as visible in the skies of the starter moons, are a stunning sight, and all the terrains I've encountered so far have been interesting and plausible. Characters are still blocky abominations, but the universe itself is a looker.

* Unfortunately, performance continues to degrade, even though the PC I play on now is far superior to the one I used for Empyrion back in the day. This is further evidence to me that the ""released"" version of the game was just another alpha, and it arguably still is.

* Eleon has attempted to craft a story, complete with a brand new tutorial, NPCs and interactive dialogue. It's crap. The writing is trite, boring and amateurish, like it was written for kids, but with none of the charm or clarity one would expect from a competent children's author.

* Not only is the writing bad, but it is presented through a UI that is an eye-bleeding mess of colored text and exclamation marks.

* Water is now animated and looks nice, but still has no discernible physics. Drowning at the bottom of a lake?  Just dig a hole.

* There are some new weapons (like a crossbow and flamethrower), but none of this matters since the combat and first-person mechanics still fall prey to all the criticism I expressed two years ago.

* The Empyrion experience remains of amateurish quality compared to many similar titles. It can still be fun in co-op, but the devs have done very little since v1.0 to actually make the game better. Making changes =/= improvement.

Original review below.

-----------------------------------------------------

Until today, Empyrion was in Early Access for five years, and I suspect it will remain in an EA state for years more, if not perpetually.

I've reached high-tier survival maybe a handful of times in all the years I've played this title, with most of my 600+ hours having gone into early to mid-game efforts whenever a new alpha drops. That's not to say I don't play for fun. I do, almost exclusively, and I wouldn't keep checking in if I thought Empyrion sucked completely. FWIW, the building system is engaging, and exploration can be loads of fun in co-op.

However, there's a notion going around that players are somehow unreasonable when they're critical of Eleon Game Studios or the game after X number of hours played.

A certain fanboy/moderator would apparently have everyone believe that his own 16,000 hours played is somehow reflective of the immense quality of this game, and anyone who has hundreds or thousands of hours is in fact a living testimony to Eleon Game Studios' unrivaled greatness.

Meanwhile, in the real world, Empyrion is clunky, bug-ridden, amateurish and frustrating even at its best.

I'm usually fine with that. Kenshi is one of my favorite games of all time, after all. But ""You played X hours and got your money's worth, so shut up,"" is not an argument. 

Version 1.0 is not a complete game, and shouldn't be portrayed as such through deliberately confusing manipulations of common game dev nomenclature.

However, if ""shut up"" is the official fanboy/moderator/developer position, then my official position is a negative review, and a strong recommendation to look elsewhere for sci-fi survival.

Few similar games do as much as Empyrion on such a massive scale, but nearly every game I can think of does what it does, within its own scope, better than Empyrion.

- The first-person mechanics are perhaps the worst I've ever seen. Playing Empyrion doesn't feel like moving around as a character, but rather gives me the sense of a camera on wheels. Animations are ugly or nonexistent for basic tasks. It would've been a damn shame twenty years ago. Today it's inexcusable.

- Characters are hideous and hideously animated. Despite the first-person woes, don't even think about playing this in third-person.

- Combat is an uninspired, impact-lacking mess. Weapons feel like BB guns, and even saying that feels like an undeserved insult to air rifles. If there's one single gameplay element that kills my Empyrion joy faster than any other, it's the awful, pea-shooter combat. This is unforgivable, because combat is central to the game unless you're only in it for creative mode.

- The AI is rock-stupid and blatantly plays by different rules. Enemies can magically ""hack"" (take over) your base from long range if they can't reach your core, and their base and ship weapons are superior to player weapons in almost every way. Fighting against NPCs is essentially a matter of learning how to cheese. Recent attempts to create end game content have exacerbated this problem.

- Unity Store assets are still commonplace. I mean ... whatever, I guess. I couldn't afford to make my own game assets, either.

- Physics—what physics?

- Flight model—what flight model?

(It's been brought to my attention that I should point out there technically is a so-called flight model. Sadly, there's no real sense of mass or weight. Never was, and neither the ""flight model"" nor atmospheric engines that were added with it changed this. The same floating camera phenomenon that applies to walking/running also applies to every class of vehicle. I say this as a flight sim fan who thinks Space Engineers and No Man's Sky both did a decent fakery job with flight, and I would have been fine with something similar in Empyrion.)

- Bugs. Everywhere. Various systems are glitchy.

- No volumetric water. Dug a hole at the bottom of a lake? Congratulations, you've made a permanent air pocket that you can build on and live in just like on dry land. This also means you can't create a Minecraft-style backyard pond, or build a Subnautica-style underwater home. I mean, you *can* build underwater, but it's just depressing.

- Canned environmental sounds, probably from the Unity Store (I can't confirm this). It's weird to be on a completely alien planet, but hear crickets and howling wolves.

This is all stuff one would expect of an ALPHA product, of course.

If you just want to build stuff or walk around on some same-y alien worlds, it's hard to say Empyrion isn't worth twenty bucks. It's huge with lots of moving parts. If you're looking for a deep game with polished (or even competent) survival and action mechanics, investing time in Empyrion might leave you some combination of irritated, bored and sad.

It feels tedious. I keep starting it up thinking I'm gonna survive and build and make some ships to explore the universe with this, but at every step, it's just tedious.

Want to build a hut? Okay, grab your survival multitool, set it to resource mode, now what? Find four different types of rocks. Iron, copper, silicon and stone. Hold M1 on them. Takes about 6 seconds each. Step on your hoverbike, drive to the next rocks. Okay, all good, just basic gathering mechanics, not exactly fun, but sigh. 

Gather those materials, oh! You don't have a portable constructor. Make that thing in your menu. You can't, because you need to unlock it. Press F3, scroll down to the portable constructor, unlock it. Make the constructor from the crafting menu. Place it down on the ground. Now, move each and every thing that you gathered into the portable constructor. 
You got some concrete blocks, you can't build anything. What?! Why?!

Oh, you need a 'Starter' block. Ohh, okay, so it's got this thing that makes the code easier to work with, okay, well, whatever. Probably some stupid reason for it. Place the block down, now you can build. Wait, there's now this ugly block that's crucial to my base, and it's on the ground. How do I move it? You can't. You need to destroy it, which you can't do without bullets, because just picking it up the way you placed it, impossible. Weird? sigh stupid design reasons, probably. Go build a gun and some ammo, shoot the thing and replace it. Oh, a core is expensive. You need more materials. Are you having fun yet? You don't even have a floor!

The whole game is like that. It's chores upon chores with no actual reason to it, it's a design choice revolving around filler to give you the idea that you're actually building and crafting and solving problems, but when you've done this 5 times, you start to get done with it. 

Okay, so just play creative, right? Okay, let's start in creative mode. Okay, cool, I got a ship, I don't need to gather a bunch of stuff, ugh, and I can just fly wherever. Cool. Let's fly. Oh, the planet's got a couple of cool things, there's a crashed ship here, there's even a half-broken down vehicle that can still fly. Fucking neat, that's awesome. Let me just fix that up, seems like something that would happen in a sci-fi movie. Cool. Proceed to spend the next 10 minutes sorting items in your toolbar. Build your ship the way you want it, 30 minutes later, you've got something, and you're flying. sigh alright let's get going already, I need to see some fun stuff. 

That's a radioactive planet, wow. Oh, it's only got three biomes. Foggy lava, desert and mountains. There's a thing walking around there that looks like it was ripped straight from a generic sci-fi shooter, there's no lore on what that thing is. It doesn't seem to care that you exist until you touch the ground. Okay, well, that's boring, that sucks. Wish they would've done something with that. 

Look up threads, nope, nothing, just people complaining about it and people invalidating that complaining by saying stuff like ""The game isn't boring, you're boring for not having fun with it."" even though there's a reason they chose to play a game instead of imagining their dreams. Okay, that's depressing, that's not showing any hope for change. Guess I'll work with what I have. Explore more planets. Okay, icy moons, neat. Seems empty, though. There's a trading outpost, let's check that out. NPCs walking back and forth, spouting neat little lore lines. Okay, what else is there? A shop and some quests. Let's check out those quests. Oh, it's ""Go there, kill that and come back with no effect on anything at all, for some resources or money."" Okay, well, no. 

Fly to different planets, there's an alien planet. It has the exact same plants as all the other planets. Wow, a gas giant! I can't fly there, why? Read threads, unimaginative explanations as to why there's not even a city in the clouds and a death zone below. sigh. Okay, discover more moons, check out some hot planets. They're also equally empty. Damn, is this all there is? YES! THIS IS ALL THERE IS! THERE WON'T BE ANY MORE THAN THIS!

Check out Reforged Eden. There's more content, but it's also geared towards all the players who fucking love grinding. You can now make even less concrete with the stone you spent 20 minutes grinding. ""Happy days, you should've learned the one meta way to do everything, because otherwise you suck."" Thanks Reddit. Explore some stuff. Wow. There's way more planet types, there's more things to find. Well, I can't go back to the vanilla game now. 

Guess I'll never touch survival mode again, not until I either muster up the massive patience I need to grind my way to getting to the point where things become cool, or I figure out a way to transform my mind into building a scenario for myself where I start with some cheated resources, and then learn how to enjoy the struggle that is building and maintaining things in this game.

There's just something wrong with how games are done. Everything feels like a fucking chore in all the techy games. It's like... nerds got bullied into getting a job so hard that they worked that into their games, any other way I put it is just far less probable than that. Stationeers, Space Engineers. All of these techy games have this void of content. No Man's Sky is a grindfest with empty content as well. The only content is grindy, doable in only very specific ways, and the fanbase is aaaalllwayssss going to invalidate your discontent.

As for the stigma:

There's some specific stigma with this game because it's got performance problems and hasn't changed much since 2016. Content changes a little bit, but not much, and while the playerbase knows it, most of them will find some way to stab your liver over popping their denial bubble. Multiplayer is shit, no use sugarcoating it. It's glitchy, it's laggy. 
There are a lot of inconvenient things that other games do better. For example, idle power consumption. Stuff like a 'food processor' (glorified hotplate) eats power even when you're not using it. So, you can turn things off, right? Well, you need to go into the menu and find each and every object that you want to turn off. There's signal logic for that! So what does that have you do: Spend 20 minutes hotwiring your base just so that it won't draw a bunch of power for no reason. All because of that design decision. siiiiighhhhhhhahhhhh...

In Space Engineers, you can wire your ship guns up to your toolbar. You can't do that in this game, and they refuse to add it. There's zero reason not to add it. Zero. Zero. Zero. ZERO!

Despite all that, Empyrion's the best I've got right now, and it's either this, or imagine stuff. I'd take this over Space Engineers, Stationeers. If you've ever played Starmade and thought ""This is shit, but it could be good"" then get this game.
If you don't mind the grind, get this game and immediately download Reforged Eden, a massive mod without which the game is barren. Imo it really is a pretty game, but expect your PC to be a space heater.",1704867087,1704867142,False,15,2,0.49855920672416687,0,True,False,False

I love the way the game is going, now with the implementation of vollume for cargo and the new NPC fractions it becomes more real and it won´t stop there.

But this team has a way of realy working on the game and I´m glad they´re not afraid to implement real changes. Many people whant the game to stay how it was, or at least get the older saves to work, but big bold steps makes the development of this game  so great.

A real treat.

It´s under cunstruction of corse and changes, bugs, balance issues 
are something to be expected.

But as it stands now, just realy good and I hope for more to come.

I specially admire, how close it is to fulfill most of the gametags it has on the storepage.

FPS and adventure gamers.

Lucky for me, I have a taste for the mixture.

It is a huge satisfaction to explore the galaxy with custom Capital Ships full of different small ships inside them, upgrading them on the way, making your own bases with different specializations, mining asteroids, getting out and flying in the vacuum of space to explore wrecks, and raiding enemy bases in planets and in space. 
The potential this game has is something beyond.
It has bugs... but things can be fixed with a reconnect or with the console. It also needs a bit of polishing, but those problems are so little compared with the greatness it has.

------

Update 1/9/2024 - I managed to come back and enjoy the game thanks to a mod on the workshop completely breathing new life into the game. 

Meanwhile the devs of the actual game have been trying to shape this game into something that could be reasonably be considered 1.0 until they hit us with a new partnership with Funcom along with a DLC announcement......very confusing.   

It seems obvious that development has stagnated as well as income and they have to find other means to fund the project. I support that but part of the issue was going ""1.0"" years back despite openly admitting the game is nowhere near release state. 

If it wasn't for that mod on the workshop I would have seen this game going the way of Starmade / Star Forge ages ago.

I can't even put my finger on exactly what ruined it for me, but nothing after an hour or so felt worthwhile or rewarding, so I stopped playing and don't plan to play it anymore. The recent news of paid DLC seems like a bit of a bad thing and I hope they don't use this as a reason to never fix/improve the base game, but that's not why I'm giving this game a thumbs down. Anyway, I'd say avoid this and get one of the many other comparable games instead, but it's not the worst game I've played by any means, so don't let me stop you from giving it a go.

But it does not say that it will not fit this base. Built a window L and it fit - but it was sticking in so i had to move it. 
Well guess what - there is no move feature - once you place it - you can only break it. 
The game looks very dated too. Not something you should waste time on these day and age.
Edit Jan 2024. 
Decided to give it another go. In the 3 minute - stuck in a trap (digging resource and cannot get out). Spent 1 hour to get out. Restarted. 
Second run - exploring the ruins - killed a few dinos - then came 5 big and 12 small dinos. Killed me. Lost all my resources which I was gathering for the past hour. 
Given up.

---2024 - Mass and volume update -----------------
What took 5 minutes to do now requires 30 minutes and a CV cargo ship to do.
Just picking up large constructor and moving it one block to the left is now an ordeal.
Mass and volume update is just sucking the fun out of the game.
----------------------------------------------------------------


A lot of the quests are broken due to recent changes to game mechanics.
* Too easy to lose you matrix key.
* You can easily get trapped in the obelisk. Easy to get in but need matrix key to get out.
If you follow the quest chain you go to a way station in orbit around Crown. There is a teleporter there which takes you to Omicron. Make sure you are well geared and have a working constructor because finding carbon substrate on Omicron will take hours and hours of your time. Far preferred it when all you needed was ore or rocks to make a survival constructor.

My wish list
You can cook meat with the portable heater.
You can get carbon from trees. Trees who would figure they have carbon in them. Thus avoiding problems getting carbon on the non starter worlds.
Fix the motorbike steering. Most bikes can do a u-turn in less than 3 km's
Bring back the cooking recipes. Now everything is generic vegetables and boring.
Allowing players to farm. ie 18 grow plots should be able to support one player.
15 salami's per day to stay fed
Quest Items are stored in the ether, that way you cant loose them and they don't fill half your backpack.
When a new person joins a multiplayer game new ore bodies are generated which only they can see. That way they can play the game as opposed to walk the barren mined out planet.

Stop with the stupid deaths, I jump and break my leg and 60 seconds later you have necrosis and die 60 seconds after that.
Frost bite kills you from blood loss? 
Increase damage of starting weapons. Starter world of Masperon I unload an entire clip from an assault rifle into a bug man as it walks up to me and scratches me. You infected me with a parasite which kills you in 60 seconds. Can I have just a little more time to finish my fight and splint my leg before dying.
Increase the despawn time. I am fighting 4 spiders, the first despawns while I am killing the fourth. Drones attack you and despawn before you can loot them.

With each patch the game oscillates from ludicasly easy to frightenly hard. 
Easy: I crash land in the garden of eden, minerals are abundant, food is abundant and there is a shelter set up for you. You can stick gun turrets on SV's
Hard: 10 seconds after placing a base block 4 drones appear and shoot you up. You try to kill then with a pistol but 500 round just isn't enough. POIs are surrounded by regenerating shields requiring hovercraft's firing 18 mini guns continuously for 20 minutes to breach.

So much potential, could be amazing, but frustration makes it not worth it. Very addictive, but it all leads to a sense of pointlessness and emptiness.

Does many things well, and if you are lucky enough to not have the bugs or issues, or are willing to work through it, it could be amazing i'm sure,

Also I rarely post a review with either more than 90 min (if I refunded it) or less than 25h if I kept it.  Im posting a positive on THIS with 2.9h and decided to keep it at 97 min.  if that tells you anything. 

I got Empyion during the winter sale for like $10 or something.  I have to say its certainly worth that despite its flaws.

As for the flaws ive found so far:

--Tutrorial is mostly useless and confusing.
--building stuff is SUPER WONKY!  About as dense as Space Engineers.  I cant build anything in that game either.  But I suppose if you put a lot of time into learning how, then maybe its ok?  I mean people make some amazing things in Empyrion.  So maybe thats not such a big flaw, but it could be a lot easier.  A LOT easier!
--my first online game:  PvP and couldnt find anyone.  so I dug a hole to hide my constructor while I tried to set up a base.  Died of Radiation despite being in a Mecenary armored space suit?  AND under 10m of earth?  maybe I mines into radioactive soil, IDK.  Im not the Russian Army so I generally dont do stuff like that...  Ha Ha thats a joke based on a now modern historical SNAFU.

So I respawned the only place I could:  the Respawn (cloning) chamber on the crashed ship.  and found myself jammed between the medical pod and a wall.  Died of blood loss caused by standing there wondering how to get out.  Respawned again: trapped in same place.  so my entire run is now ended until the server resets.  Learned the game has a 3rd game mode!  PvR (Player Vs Respawn)!

My advice:  buy this and enjoy it!  But plan to watch YT how-to vids because it will be frustrating.

Empyrion Galactic Survival offers a commendable space exploration experience with some standout features.

Ship Building: The ship building mechanics are robust, providing a decent level of customization. Crafting vessels to suit your needs is enjoyable, though a steeper learning curve may deter some players.

Combat: Engaging in space and planetary combat is a highlight. The combat system is well-executed, offering a good balance of strategy and action. However, occasional glitches and AI quirks can disrupt the immersion.

Exploration: The game's universe is expansive, encouraging exploration. Uncharted planets and celestial bodies offer diverse environments to discover. However, some may find the exploration repetitive after a while.

Progression Mechanics: The sense of progression is well-implemented, with resource gathering and technology unlocking contributing to a satisfying advancement. However, pacing issues may lead to occasional frustration.

In conclusion, Empyrion Galactic Survival is a commendable space game with its share of strengths and weaknesses. While the ship building, combat, exploration, and progression elements are engaging, some aspects could benefit from further refinement.

Since everyone loves bullet points;
Pros:
- Massive universe to explore. Relics, derelict ships, planets and hostile ships (large and small) fill the voids. 
- Survival mechanics aren't too nagging once you get some food and water systems online. 
- You can build ships in offline free-build mode with infinite resources, and save it as a blueprint. Bring a blueprint into a Survival game and as long as you have the resources, the ship will autobuild. Can also get ship designs from Workshop if you can't be bothered to build your own.
- Multiplayer with friends is a blast, and works well enough. Fun to bring everyone's capital ships to bear against an enemy dreadnought. 

Cons:
- Not much of a physics system going on. Can't build piston systems or rotors to transform do cool stuff like in Space Engineers. (This game is more intuitive and easier to get into though)
- Can't move around ships while they are in motion.
- If you log out on a friend's ship and they proceed to warp to a new sector (like a new map) you will be left floating in space. If they stay in the same sector/playfield you will be on their ship. Dashed our hopes of making a single capital vessel and exploring the universe.
- Planets can feel pretty same-y after you explore each of the types. A lot of the same POIs (enemy bases and such) are cookie cutter assets placed around.
- Online can be glitchy and have a lot of desync.


I've played a fair bit of this and enjoy it greatly. It's a good adventure focused Survival game with big ships in space.

For one reason only, and I know many of you will mock this and me, but I don't care. It has foul language in it. I am a Christian, an uncompromising one. I won't play where I can't turn off or hide the profanity. So disappointing that everyone thinks you have to cuss just to make a game, movie, or TV show. Totally ruined the whole game for me. I know I can bypass the quests and stuff, but I can't even take jobs or enter stations because of the use of cuss words in the NPC's. You can see my original review below... So disappointing. As you can see I spent a lot of hours in the game, trying to just enjoy it for the exploration and creative building, but that didn't cut it when I couldn't take my creations out into the universe and take on jobs and such.

Original Review Below:

This is almost everything I've been searching for in a survival, crafting, sandbox game. I have a whole universe to explore, however I want. I can completely bypass the quest line and story lines if I want to, build capital space vessels to explore the galaxy, cool bases on far flung planets. Fight space aliens, pirates, religious zealots, and more. You can raise and lower your reputation with all the factions over and over again. Getting bored being a space pirate, work to raise your rep with another faction and become a pirate hunter! I can easily see why so many players have many thousands of hours in this game. You can play on servers with others, you can PVP, or PVE, single player is awesome! There is an amazing creative mode to allow you to build to your hearts content. So much to do!!!!

There are a few negatives. 1. The graphics are not stellar (pun intended), you're not going to be looking at UE5 stuff here, but they are still good and the sky is amazing and beautiful. 2. The NPC AI is terrible, it's probably the worst thing about this game. They are highly predictable and do stupid things like walk into doors and such. 3. Some of the elements need replacing (no dinosaurs please). 4. There are some bugs and such, but what game (hello ARK?) doesn't have them.

This game is being developed by and indie developer, so even though it's been out for some time, they are still working on it, updating, adding to it. There is a ton of stuff in the workshop; mods, bases, ships. And even if they stopped now, I'd be perfectly happy to keep playing it. This was a gem in the midden heap of trash on STEAM.

I find it puzzling that my Steam playtime counter doesn't reflect the significant hours I've invested in this game since its alpha days.

The game's core issue lies in its persistent rawness, a factor that's hard to ignore. It's unclear why the game receives frequent updates and ongoing support from its creators, yet lacks essential quality of life improvements and overall game optimization. Over the past eight years, as I closely followed Empyrion's development, there hasn't been a defining moment signaling an official release with a clear shift toward content addition and game improvement. Instead, the game grapples with persistent challenges: a steep learning curve, inconsistencies in basic mechanics, subpar animations, and inadequate optimization.

The first two issues go hand in hand. From a veteran's standpoint, starting a new game feels comfortable, swiftly evolving into a formidable force with your own ship and engaging in base construction. However, these aspects remain elusive to newcomers due to Empyrion's unnecessary complexity and illogical design, creating a discomforting experience. Despite considering Empyrion an excellent space sandbox, I was surprised by the straightforward questions posed by friends to whom I recommended the game. This revelation came after returning from a two-year hiatus, emphasizing how forgetting the basics significantly diminishes the game's appeal.

Animation issues are not uncommon in indie projects, and Empyrion is no exception. The visual impact of actions induces an uncomfortable sense of dissonance, with slightly off laser beams and tool displacement contributing to this discomfort. I found that the impact of shots in the original Doom surpasses what Empyrion's enemies show in response to gunfire, in my opinion.

Optimization remains another stumbling block. I consistently achieve 30-40 fps, regardless of graphical settings. However, what perplexes me is that adjusting various graphical settings doesn't significantly impact the frame rate. Surprisingly, the frame rate experiences a remarkable boost to over 70 frames per second when I reduce the resolution from 1440p to 1080p. This unexpected contrast in performance adjustments leaves me questioning the logic behind the game engine. Additionally, mouse and keyboard responsiveness remains normal during typical scenarios, such as observing a barren landscape or flying through space. However, when focusing on intricate environments like jungles or complex structures, input lag and 'sticky' controls become apparent.

While one might forgive these 'infantile' problems in an early access title, over eight years of development should deliver a more refined product. Unfortunately, Empyrion remains underdeveloped and uncomfortable, making it hard for me to recommend purchasing the game.",1703347877,1703347877,False,9,0,0.511502087116241455,2,True,False,False
383120,32215143,76561198241835434,0,155,10870,0,7793,1704218487,"I remember what this game used to be, but now its trying to copy no mans sky and its starting to turn into a hot mess.

THIS GAME IS A MIXED BAG. I played this when it originally came out, and im playing it in multiplayer with my friends currently. It is trying to be too many things at the same time, and while some parts (like the building) work really well, most other gameplay elements are grossly unfinished and buggy. This is the sort of game you play with trial and error by relying on the wiki for info. If you messed something up... too bad ... start over. There is a tutorial system, but it is not user friendly and is outright distracting.

To setup the context, we played a 3 player game on a personal vanilla server on the most recent release.

There are too many things wrong with this game to list, but here are a few: 
 - constant error messages on loot containers
- ship clipping through the floor terrain of the base when landing gear is not set up or glitched.
- NPC models and animations are unfinished. Feels like they are placeholders from an asset store.
- survival elements need more tuning ( you have to eat way too often and just dealing with the survival aspect of the game can be completely negated by dying and respawning). I would say remove the old-school survival system all together. It feels tacked on and does more to hinder the enjoyment of the game. Why would i bother with medicine and food when i can just die and respawn at no cost at all. It has to be reworked!!! Please Mr Developer look at what Valheim is doing with its survival and learn from it.
- Damage and Danger are not properly conveyed to the player. It is not clear when it is safe to leave your CV/SV in space and when it is not. Its also unclear which NPCs are friendly and which aren't, basically just shoot anything that moves...and then deal with the enemy factions after.
- transition from atmosphere to space is very jarring and laggy. There is no loading screen, but it takes a few seconds to load anyway. I have even had freezes of the game as its loading the next scene. Optimization is needed.
- base building is a bit buggy when you have to clear terrain from various objects (not allowed to build near a deposit even if its depleted, invisible blocks in the air not allowing to build and leaving massive holes in the base)
- the XP system is a complete joke (best way to get xp is to spam click wild grain plants for hours).
- lots game mechanics are not represented or explained in an user friendly way. For example, cockpits get free oxygen meaning you dont have to turn on ship oxygen to breathe; Destroying a container controller will actually drop all of the items on the ground when destroyed (no warning); ship turrets and weapons will not work properly from a first-person perspective due to the angle that you placed them at; you cannot pick up heavy items if you are not connected to a container network and if left on ground will despawn in 3 minutes; Ship thrusters and jets will heat up, however, they can be covered up completely with blocks with no impact to performance to the ship; CPU and power output are not explained at all - while you might consume only 25% of the power, it can go up to 100%+ if your ship is stuck on terrain - thus DAMAGING the generator; hoverbikes will despawn if left on the ground and so on...

If you are willing to put up with this games quirks, there is a decent simulation game underneath. You get full ship customization options, graphics are actually insane for this caliber of game, planet simulation is a bit wonky looking and wayyyy overdone, but its a nice feature; you can color anything any color you want, progression path is decent; there are tons of details in the game that you will only notice after playing for a while; Plus i can still see tons of updates being rolled out by the developer, so it is still being worked on and is not forgotten. There is very high replay value, especially if you can convince your friends to buy it.

For Empyrion developer/s: You have a very nice game here, but please just focus on the stronger aspects of the game, instead of trying 50 different systems that dont work together.

Recommend getting this when its on 50% off. And its more fun in coop/mp.",1496733695,1703343287,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Empyrion - Galactic Survival, developed by Eleon Game Studios, is an open-world space survival adventure that combines elements of exploration, building, and combat both in space and on various planets. This game stands out with its detailed crafting system, extensive base building, and the sheer scope of exploration it offers.

Gameplay and Mechanics
Empyrion's gameplay is a blend of survival, construction, and exploration in a vast universe. Players start either on a planet or in space, with basic equipment. The initial challenge is to survive by gathering resources, crafting tools, and building shelters. The game progresses into more complex endeavors like constructing spaceships and space stations, exploring different planets, and engaging in space and ground combat.

The crafting system is extensive, with a wide range of materials and blueprints. Players can design and build everything from small fighters to massive capital ships and intricate bases, each with their own set of functionalities.

Resource management is a critical aspect. You must balance the need for food, oxygen, and materials while exploring hostile environments. This aspect adds a layer of strategic planning to the gameplay.

Exploration and Combat
Exploration is a cornerstone of Empyrion. Each planet has its unique ecosystem, flora, and fauna, along with varying environmental challenges. The thrill of landing on an unexplored planet for the first time is a highlight of the game.

Combat in Empyrion can occur on land or in space, with a variety of weapons and vehicles at the player's disposal. The combat mechanics are solid, offering both a challenge and excitement.

Multiplayer Aspect
Playing with others adds another dimension to Empyrion. The game supports cooperative and PvP modes. Building and exploring with friends or engaging in space battles against other players greatly enhances the overall experience.

Learning Curve and Customization
Empyrion has a moderate learning curve. New players might feel overwhelmed initially by the survival aspects and the depth of the building system. However, the game does a decent job of guiding players through its mechanics.

The customization options are impressive. Players can let their creativity run wild, building unique structures, ships, and bases. The game’s physics and environmental factors must be considered, adding a layer of realism and challenge.

Graphics and Performance
Graphically, Empyrion is quite pleasing, with beautiful space vistas, diverse planets, and detailed models. The game is regularly updated, improving both its visuals and performance.

Community and Support
The player community is helpful, with many veteran players offering advice and sharing blueprints. The developers are actively involved, constantly updating the game with new content and improvements based on player feedback.

Conclusion
Empyrion - Galactic Survival is an excellent game for players who enjoy a mix of survival, building, and exploration in a rich sci-fi setting. The game offers a vast universe to explore, a deep building system, and engaging survival mechanics. While there is a learning curve, the sense of accomplishment from building your first spaceship or surviving on a hostile planet is unmatched. Empyrion is a must-play for fans of space exploration and creative building games.",1703031010,1703031010,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

But the early acces was without bad reason. the game have always big modification, and after the end of earlyacces, it will always need a lot of work, but the main work is here, they need to modify, add few things, balance few items .... 

The game is good, but with a lot of little problem need to be resolve.
The game need a better tutorial, about reputation, (with that the faction who attack you without any reason make you become their ennemi just because you have a base and protect yourself from their drone/attack)
when you search information about amno or difference between two same part you can't have the information clear, after craft the sentry/weapon you can see the amno when it is in your inventory, but not before craft it.
Actually i'm angry because i can't find any information about 2drill module for the hoover. i think i must play a party in creativ only to try all element, and after i can play the game, (but at this moment i lost all the part funny for me because i see it in creativ why play the game after).
we can't have asteroid on solo party with the game normal we have to add a command for that, they didn't add the option when create the party.


The game is good, no lag, good concept, but when we add little problem here, an othere here, need information here, or here.... the game need a lot of work.

For me the game can be buy if good promotion, but after a long time in developpement... we can think it is near the end, but not, i think we are in the middle of developpement of the game or before. Why do we have solar cell, but can't load them with generator? why limit to 15solar panel and no limit for solar cell (i think we can't charge a lot of them or maybe need to upgrade their effect the first small generator give2.5kw, with 15solar panel we can get around 750w only, why use solar when cut a tree give 3xmore power even in the night ?

There are safe planets where your base and ship builds are temporary, and there are more hostile planets/territories where you can establish more permanent builds, so long as you are prepared to defend your structures from assault drones and various factions.

Unfortunately we experienced a scuffed moment during our first warp drive. Our ship entered the next planetary system and was destroyed by an NPC ship within seconds, before the warp drive loading screen was even finished, causing us to lose everything we've worked for the past 2 days.

I reached out to support on discord and one of the developers responded within an hour. He told us this was basically just an unfortunate scenario that is incredibly rare. He ended up restoring our ship on the official server and restoring my faith in the game.

This is an incredibly fun game and will consume many more hours of creativity building our dream capital vessel. In addition, the hands on developers provided great support and fixed our issue for us very quickly. 

One of the best 14$ I've spent, cannot complain.

This means that breaking changes can occur anytime (and they do), that your saved games get eventually screwed up and you have to start over several times to enjoy the current features. Started playing when it was Alpha 5 or so... now it is 10. And the problem without a TImeline is, that you end up unfinished eventually. Lack of funding, lack of goals etc.
I do not doubt the dedication of Eleon, but this game's development just takes too long to be taken seriously.
Not only is the game a sandbox, the development is, too.
I really love the gameplay (actually over 200 hours in it) - no question. And it's brilliant what they have created by using Unity3D.
But it is ever-changing right now, which outweighs the long-term fun.
In addition, the FAQ are completely outdated (""we are using Unity3D 5.3 right now"") and no timeline for a Mac build given.

82 more hours played, Alpha 12 now...
Nothing has changed = Everything has changed. There are so many things in this game that are outstanding well designed, but it's simply not worth the effort once you discover that you're only playing in a universe which rules will eventually break into pieces (this includes your save game).
Still wondering why the A.I. constantly attacks me with vessels that can't be constructed with the resources that are available on the current planet (i speak of rockets; and of loot that can't be created with the existing resources). Very irritating because the resources in this game are limited (which I personally find very annoying - they should refresh/respawn).

...and now ""Alpha"" ends. And Eleon put up an explanation what that means. Well - no roadmap again, no plans to get this thing to Gold 1.0. They can do what they want of course, but they shouldn't forget who funded them. As long as they behave like ""this is our hobby project, please don't expect anything and thanks for all the fish"", this negative review will stay as a reminder.

v1.0 now. Yay!
It was too tempting to start a new game. Singleplayer, everything on default, Survival. Let's Go. Start the first mission - find a signal source. Found an abandoned teleport station. Wrecked. In neutral territory. But when I examine the cargo containers there it says that my reputation with Polaris will be negative once I open them. WTF? I'm in the middle of nowhere, this structure is abandoned and the Polaris will somehow be informed when I open one of the left-alone cargo containers here? *sigh* perhaps someday someone will find the time to put at least a little bit of effort in the game design. Waiting for the next version now.

Welcome to v15: ""starting a new game is mandatory"". lol.

ok, in v15: you play 5 minutes and reach the point where you have to unlock the portable constructor. But everything is already green and your level is 25. Total lack of a minimum QA before releasing something to the public. Tells stories about the game.

After 393 Hours... another try. v1.10.5... starting on a snow planet. Crashing down. Finding myself in a irreparable ship. Cannot deconstruct it! Why? It even does not have a core!

This game really is as close to my dream game as possible.  You can explore the galaxy, you can build bases on planets, you can build vehicles to go around planets, you can build fighters, you can build capital ships, you can build space stations.  It is all pretty good and encompasses everything.   There are plenty of unique locations (especially if you download the insanely popular mod that I believe the developers despise....)  There are different space stations that feel buzzing with life.  Plus you can play on public servers with other people.  This game feels like what No Man's Sky wanted to be.   So with that said, what are the pros and cons?

Pros:
- The space scope of the game is there.  Want to have a space station operation?  You got it!  Want to have a massive capital vessel and take your entire city with you?  Go ahead?  Want to build a city on a planet and operate from there?  Yep!  You can make your little space adventure dreams come true in a way no other game does.
- Creative mode is a little difficult, but you can check the workshop for some of the best things ever and try them out!  Want to put DS9 or Babylon 5, two of the most popular nerdom stations ever, someone has already made them in creative mode.  Want to take the Enterprise, the Millennium Falcon, or even Snoopy's Doghouse WWI Flying ace out for a run?  YOU CAN.  The workshop is full of amazing builds.  
- World are MAPPABLE.  Everything is put on them and you can find your way around on a map.  I don't think people realize how awesome this is.  The planets are relatively small too, but big enough to feel like you have to explore them.  Worlds also seem to have different biomes on them.  It isn't just the same thing.  In NMS you could look around for 2 minutes, and you know what the world is.
-  The multiplayer aspect is fun.  Much like Valheim, you can right away play with your friends.  Want to take your friend on a spaceship trip?  Just slap on an enclosed passenger seat and they can come with you.  It really is great stuff.
-  Everything is actually quite scientific.  If you load up your cargo with tons of weight, the thrusters will struggle to get you off the ground.  There seems to be a lot of physical science involved in all aspects of motion and energy.  

Cons:
- The biggest con to me is the combat.  Enemies hit you from far away.  They jump around the screen crazy sometimes.  The enemies are kind of silly and very limited.  Spiders and zombies.  Everything about the combat feels clunky.  The space combat is average at best too.  The dogfighting in Freelancer or X-Wing Alliance is better.
- The sound design is really bad.  When you shoot your ship's guns, it sounds like a buzzing fax machine or an ATM dispensing money.  There is no thump in the sound department.
- Missions can be clunky.  I did a mission once where I skipped a step that was unnecessary, the interface told me to do something else AHEAD of the last step.  I have to travel 2km to touch something once (a wall), THEN go to the Elder.  I was working on the tutorial mission and took a teleporter to Omicron.  I was whisked away and I could not access the teleporter to go back to my base area.  There was no warning, no nothing.  I would have brought food and bandages, and stuff to be ready for this. So I had to kill myself, build a ship to go get my old ship, then prepare myself to go to Omicron. What the butt? 
- I think there is an overarching story, but it isn't told very well.
- The game has a COOP mode, and it works fine for some people.  But it will break suddenly.  To play COOP, you have to do some dedicated server stuff.   For people who don't program, it is confusing and it is very annoying.  Games like Valheim, Stardew Valley, PlateUp, ect. have click and coop figured out, so should this game.
- Good lord, the hunger and food aspect of this game is so stupid.  You can eat 10 cheeseburgers and 10 steaks and die of hunger within a half day of in game time.  You can also die of indigestion.  Seriously.  No tums?  YOU DIE.  Turn off the stupid hunger when you play, it is SO stupid.
- This game is an internal memory hog.  It is amazing how much this thing sucks your GPU and internal memory.  You literally need 32 gb of RAM to run this thing at the best settings.

I recommend this game.  I would not try to do the story stuff.  Just get a friend or a group and play.  Maybe join a server, but those can be hit or miss.   When you get off the planet for the first time, it feels earned.  You want to go to different star systems to see what might be there.  Warning, you will be frustrated by many many aspects of this game, but overall, the ability to do all this fun stuff makes it worth it.",1697127525,1702488387,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Similar to Space Engineers you can build bases and ships while surviving various environments.  I think a lot of the gameplay resembles NMS with less grinding and more actual progression, so I'm genuinely surprised it isn't more popular than NMS.  However, it does have a few caveats that do hold it back and make it harder to get a large number of people into it.  If you enjoy building and survival in space and alien worlds and travelling and exploring space and various worlds, this game is great though.  I hope someday something more polished comes along, but this is currently the best at doing the variety of things it does.

Pros:
- A large variety of block-based building options.  Not 7D2D, but a lot of options allowing creativity.
- You can build a ship from scratch via blocks and fly it to and from space.
- You can easily ""print"" blueprints from built in, personally saved ones, or the workshop so you can still play if you aren't good at designing.
- There is a huge variety of types of world and some are positively beautiful.  All feel more realistic and generally better than the dinky NMS worlds.  For procgen, it has some very good detail to world generation.
- Combat has a lot of options and variety so you can play your style.  In theory.  (See cons...)  It's fast paced and not clunky like many games.  You can be a tank, but don't have to.
- The POIs are pretty varied and well built.  Some are actually fun to explore.  (See cons though...)
- The main story is kind of interesting, though sadly unfinished, yet the game gives you the full sandbox to play how you want and you can even just ignore it and do generated sidequests or just build or even just farm.

Cons:
- Combat is VERY unbalanced.  Many things like even simple interior turrets positively rip a player apart even in heavy combat armor.  Unfortunately, that means light armor is non-viable and that does make combat clunkier since movement is very slow.
- Much of the unbalance seems to stem from a design principle that I think is aimed at maybe four players coop.  Many things might be a good, balanced challenge for four players, but most of us struggle even to find one other person they can coax into playing this.  (I see a strange resistance among most and mostly have to play single player.)
- Status effects are way too overboard!  Even if you're wearing heavy combat armor sealed against space, many enemies can apply an effect to you with one to two hits at the most.  Most effects will kill you in a short period of time, so all you can do is fight every battle backpeddling like mad and if you get hit you probably have to just leave the entire place and rush back because you can't carry enough meds (especially for all the different types) with limited inventory space.
- CVs for some reason aren't treated like moving bases.  They don't have the same blocks, no options for some things like solar power, and have some caveats (for example, they can't fire manual weapons when you're in a world.)  This is a huge departure from the way Space Engineers treats large block ""stations"" and large block ships as the same thing other than movement.
- There are practically no physics.  Some things can fall -- an unsupported base on a world will collapse -- and etc, but ships can crash into things at 100Kps and not even get a scratch.  An especially weird caveat of this is you can't directly interact with anything moving -- including your own ship.  You just go right through it like it doesn't exist.  If you want to raid an enemy ship, you must force them to stop (which Space Friction(tm) causes them to do if their thrusters are destroyed or they are powered down) to be able to interact.
- There are no machines.  Space Engineers lets you solve a lot of problems by rigging up all sorts of things, which allows for some very out of the box solutions to things.  Empyrion, sadly, does not.
- No wheeled vehicles.  They decided to do hover vehicles instead, but they're very finnicky, not realistic, and generally just not worth putting resources into (it's best to go straight to a SV.)  Yet they're unbalanced a bit with more blocks and firepower than SVs get to try to force us to use them anyway, which just isn't nice.
- Lacks all around polish.  NPCs, enemy types, etc.  I don't expect AAA and definitely don't want Starfield (in fact, this is better in many ways!) but a lot of stuff like how frequently it throws enemies that would disturb a lot of people at you just seems to not fit the overall themes and design.  Not to mention just how silly NPCs look A-posing (at least it's not a T-pose I guess.)",1702468560,1702468560,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

Unparalleled Creative Freedom:
The ability to seamlessly transition from creative mode to survival, along with the option to export blueprints, provides an unmatched level of creative freedom. Designing bases, ships, and vehicles becomes a canvas for your imagination.

Detailed Construction Mechanics:
The level of detail in constructing bases, ships, and vehicles is commendable. Whether crafting a utilitarian outpost or a sleek interstellar vessel, the game's building mechanics allow for intricate and personalized designs.

Immersive Survival Elements:
The inclusion of survival aspects, such as the need to manage hunger, temperature, and encounters with hostile environments or creatures, adds depth to the gameplay. It creates a more immersive experience, forcing players to strategize and adapt.

Dynamic NPC Factions:
The presence of NPC factions adds an extra layer of complexity, making the game world feel alive. Interacting and trading with these factions adds variety to the gameplay and encourages exploration.

Expansive Galaxy:
The sheer size of the galaxy map, teeming with numerous stars, planets, and moons to explore, is awe-inspiring. The vastness of the universe encourages exploration and discovery, providing countless hours of gameplay.

Cons:

Bugs and Stability Issues:
Unfortunately, Empyrion is not without its flaws. Random crashes, freezes, and issues when entering or exiting a planet's atmosphere can be frustrating. While updates may address some of these concerns, it's an area that requires attention.

Mechanical Quirks:
Certain mechanics, such as docking a ship with landing gear installed, can be finicky and counterintuitive. Some aspects of the game may not work as expected, impacting the overall experience.

Optimization for Multiplayer:
While the game shines in multiplayer, there's room for improvement. The addition of more content and the ability to move around on ships in motion, especially with gravity generators, would enhance the cooperative experience.

Conclusion:
Empyrion: Galactic Survival offers an expansive and immersive sandbox experience, perfect for players who revel in creative freedom and exploration. While the bugs and mechanical quirks can be frustrating, the potential for improvement through updates and a dedicated community make this game a worthwhile investment, especially for those who enjoy multiplayer adventures in the vastness of space.

Empyrion has NPCs, trading, factions, enemies to fight, bases to defend and assault.

I also enjoy building stuff more in Empyrion over SE. You still need to have a bunch of stuff in your ship to make it run: fuel, oxygen, a warp drive etc but unlike SE you can just slap the bits and pieces you need anywhere on your ship and stuff magically moves around to where it needs to go. So you can spend more time building a cool ship and less time worrying about how it's going to work. 

Oh, and the blueprints are great. Empyrion comes with a bunch of built-in blueprints plus a ton on the workshop. To build a blueprint, all you need to do is shove a bunch of resources at it and wait for it to be finished, it's that easy.

My only gripe with the game is that it's a bit janky. The UI makes it hard to tell what you're supposed to do for quests, and the enemy AI is very hit or miss.

However, with the recent disappointment that was Starfield, I'm hoping others who got their hopes up for a giant open world space game with shipbuilding will see this and realize EGS has been here all along! 

The graphics arent AAA-level polished, but I've still had many occasions of being blown away by a view of a moon crossing in front of a neutron star, or staring up at a volcanic world from the barren moon, or watching a pirate ship wander too close to a space station and a storm of missile fire lighting up the sky. 

The magic is more alive in EGS than in any other game I've ever played. You can go anywhere and touch everything. Servers run with galaxies of THOUSANDS of stars, tens of thousands of planets and moons and asteroid belts and space stations. All of them feel unique. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of POIs to explore, every single one handcrafted, many by the game's own players. You build your ships block by block, no preset modules, no restrictions other than physics. Or, if you're not the creative type (like me), there are countless brilliant ship designers who have their creations in the workshop, with you can build through the in-game factory, just supply the resources. 

If you like space sci-fi, exploring space, building, anything like that, please, take a chance and play this game.

10000 plus hours in this game.  So, how could I not recommend this game? This is the amount of time you spend getting a 5 year degree.  So, basically I have another B.S. degree (pun intended).

In all seriousness though (not easy for me), this game (from the ""big picture"" standpoint) is just OK.  However, it is one of the best ship-building games on the market.

I've seen a lot of complaints about how hard it is to build working ships, or that the ships in the workshop do not work.  Well, that is simply because the developer keeps making the building more challenging.  So, older builds (that are still somehow in the top ten list in the workshop) do not even function in-game without serious modification.  This is not a bad thing.  It shows the devs are doing a good job.  Well, at least with that aspect of the game.  I think it is the best part of the game.

The quests form a good story.  But, the delivery is total trash and the triggers are buggy.  In all the time I have spent in this game, I never completed any but the tutorial quest-line because of glitches.  I only know the story from reading the text file that contains all the quest lines.

And, although there is an endless supply of new galaxies and planets, after a while they all start to look the same.  And, you can only start on a few different types of planets, and always the same used up crash landing scenario.  I just make up my own and ignore what the game offers.  Seriously, how hard is it to make a few more bugs? aliens? And why are there two dinosaurs?  Two.  It's like eating left-overs from other games.

And the workshop is literally a popularity contest where star ratings and upvotes have little to do with the functionality or even the artistic or originality of the authors and are more based on how many friends you have on your list.  There are so many really good (yet, completely unknown ship designers) that are overshadowed by the authors that self-promote to the point where players worship the ground they walk on.

Another plus is that the devs are making serious changes based on community.  The problem is that most of the community is just interested in PvP and killing things.  So, say good bye to any real substance.

So, if you want a game with challenging early game survival and (probably the best) ship building simulation on the market, but you don't care about the story or any kind of end-game, this is the game for you.",1548369970,1700896065,True,1,0,0.508426964282989502,2,True,False,True

Empyrion - Galactic Survival has become one of my all-time favorite 'goto' games in my decades of gaming.... going all the way back to my Atari 2600. 

 Without a doubt, Empyrion seems to check all the boxes of a masterfully crafted game.  Survival, check....  1st person shooter, check.....  Trade System, check....  Ship building, check....  Base building, check.....  Basic farming, check.....  Meal prep, check..... Medical drama, check.... Exploration of galaxies, check.  Has an impressively large online community that constantly post new ship and base designs that you can download, tweak, and make your own.  And you can create your own ships & bases in creative mode or survival mode, save them in the factory, and publish them to the Steam Workshop to share with the entire community, right inside the game without missing a beat!

And, while the game itself is large and quite diverse, you can add on my FAVORITE mod, REFORGED EDEN, and open the game up even more.  Unlike so many other game designers on the market, ELEON continues to support this game and provide consistent updates and bug fixes.  From time to time you may encounter a bug causing random issues or a bit of code that is not quite polished yet, but ELEON is rest assured working on the issues.  ELEON also listens to it's player base and tries to incorporate many of their suggestions and comments into the game, through updates and patches.

The only current drawback of the game that I can see, is it needs more missions and a bit more story line.  And the water, while looking very nice, needs a bit more polishing in the coding, as the water's edge can be a bit taxing on system resources.  While speaking of water, don't forget to explore the underwater plant-life once you have your first set of armor.... you will find several items under lakes that you would miss at first glance.

In conclusion, YES I RECOMMEND this game to all players of Survival type games.  Expect to grind for resources, you will have to visit many different planets to find all of the resources you need to make spectacular combat vessels or overly complex bases.  But the reward of completing your masterpiece is worth every second of grinding.

No. You will find plenty other games that focus on one thing (ship-building/combat/story-line/exploration) and truly excel at it. This is the game that pulls everything together and lets me *feel* like all the parts fit in a universe I want to conquer. Empyrion is an odd ""good enough"" that keeps me hooked, wanting to keep going. 

Ship building is solid if a bit simplistic, like building with lego
Ship combat is a game of run away when your shield is about to pop while hoping you have the firepower to kill the enemy before they do the same.
Ground combat feels well enough, but some of the spawns triggering after an event can be frustrating when they show up behind you.
Story line is quick to complete, but lets you skip bits that might have glitched out (one of the best things I have seen in games)
Exploration is mighty impressive the first time you find something new, but the amount of time a building repeats only grows the longer you play. 

Of course almost all of the ""good enough"" gets bumped up to a mighty impressive once you add in mods, multiplayer, or both. I have only played about 50 hours unmodded, and perhaps 200 of it alone. A good set of friends (one or two honestly) changes the dynamic of the game enough that we continue enjoying the experience hundreds of hours in.

This is the mantra I have adopted, much as my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vykax/recommended/383120/]erstwhile compadre[/url] had and has. Some time ago, I discovered this game via Steam Greenlight and hyped up a number of my friends. We gave it an experimental try, and though a couple of my friends ended up refunding the game, I did not. They said it seemed really unpolished, and that getting to space was extremely punishing.

I agreed, but I was willing to give the game more time. It was early access, and I was young and naive, though perhaps a bit more thrifty than I realized.

We went through similar games, but grew tired of them. Space Engineers can be enthralling, but once you've built a do-everything-machine, you start looking for mods to play with, instead, and your game grinds to a slow halt in terms of creativity and CPU runtimes. ARK is fun, as well, and with or without mods, you eventually tire of taming dinosaurs either to lose them overnight or to do nothing because you're scared of losing them after spending quite literally days making sure they were tamed and tamed properly.

Yeah you can speed them up, but you get more Pride and Accomplishment if you don't.

Five years later, Empyrion has been expanded greatly, and though we've been playing since before the release, the game is still a treasure trove of the unexpected. No longer is going into space a deathwish with nothing to do but fly around and look for things to destroy. It still could bear more distinction- more things to do, more things to customize, more things to see or to destroy, but it is now servicable and interesting. Many POIs have been held over from previous iterations, and now inhabit a much much larger pool of dungeons and waystations lovingly designed by community and developers both.

The game now uses XP to unlock components, and segregates components between Hover, Small and Capital vessels. (As well as Bases) I'm not a fan of XP systems, but there isn't any Engram or XP grind like ARK or similar games, and instead you are rewarded with a nigh-infinite amount of XP points upon hitting the relatively low level cap of 25. Otherwise, you get XP from killing enemies, placing and breaking blocks and a few other sources. Without abusing bugs, you can expect to get to the level cap within 6 or 7 days of casual playtime and have zero need for Capital ship parts before 3-5 days in.

[h1]The Caveats[/h1]

Despite my epistolization, [i]the game is still unpolished[/i]. It likely will be for years to come, granted the stop-start sprint development the game recieves, but the entire package still glistens with so much potential. What's wonderful about that sprinting of development is you can randomly log on one day and find that an entire complex system has been added with little warning. The problem is that also means large periods of nothing and minor fixes. Like so many survival-crafters, other games like this, the game is what you make of it. It still begs for more additions, more unique worlds and expansion on the game's inherent playgroundness. While the developers are willing to outsource some of that work to players, it could stand a little bit more TLC of their own. With promising showings of things like pirate asteroid bases, Stargate-esque Gateways, NPC shipyards, massively expansive planets that run the gamut of a 60 mile diameter ([i]that's big, trust me[/i]),  and so much more, the only thing that grinds my gears is knowing that 90% of the enemies and NPCs in this goddamn game are asset flips from the god forsaken unity asset store. There are SOME unique assets but [i]every time I see the motherfucking monkey-crawler-thing from Tabletop Simulator I lose my shit and I don't mean laughing.[/i]

For these reasons and many others, I do not think this game is ready for release. 1.0 came far too early in my midn. The game is not 'done', and I say with some solace that I do not think the developers think the game is done, either. If they start releasing DLC, I'm going to instantly change this to a downvote and scream at the top of lung.

That said, Empyrion is boring if you run out of things to do, and the best way to do that is to stop looking for things to do. That's most survival games, anyway. Empyrion, like many other surivival-crafters suffers from the sensation of sameness as the game drags on.

[b]If you're looking for a solid week or two weeks of gameplay with friends (or without), here you go.[/b] You, two friends and a couple days off can make something [u]amazing[/u], sometimes even by accident. I don't recommend the tutorial, and I feel like part of the fun is discovering all the features you don't expect to exist, but there are a number of community-created Scenarios that might catch your interest if the open-endedness of the base game lacks for you.

A bunch of my freinds have called it 7 Days To Die In Space but I think it's more than that.

The Positives:
[list]
[*] It's a builders dream - base (space & planet side), ground vehicles, spacecraft
[*] User selectable game play setting
[*] Destructible landscape
[*] Sandbox mode
[*] Good Graphics
[*] Good community mod support
[/list]

The Negatives:
[list]
[*] While it's supposedly out of early access it still has it's share bugs, broken quests, etc.  
[*] The tutorial aspect of the game get's weaker the further you progress in it, and I've had it bug out, or in the course of exploring I've completed some task, and a task/goal can't be completed.
[*] Updates are happening, but not as frequently as I'd like to see.
[*] The Game's primary bad guys, the Zirax, are way over powered for solo play, especially on early game worlds.
[*] While there is some automation, resource gathering is largely manual, which gets tedious after a while.
[*] Capital ships and bases use a larger versions of the same voxel blocks that Hover and Small vessels, and they can be mixed, so the large designs can't be as detailed.
[*] There are a number of arbitrary limitations - like the number of guns you can place on a base, or that you can't use solar panels on spacecraft (Capital or small) with out mods
[*] This is really more of a PVP game, as the PVE aspects are pretty weak.

Along with this, the server staff are generally biased and extremely temperamental with their reactions to criticism of any kind with regards to their conduct or the official servers themselves. Gross overreactions in the form of permanent bans in response to merely respectfully disagreeing with a moderator decision are all too common on the official servers, and the PvP community is constantly beaten down by admin incompetence and malice. 
Given that the game is not free, it is extremely surprising that arguing with a moderator on the game's discord server can be met with a permanent ban from the in game official servers. On a similar note, it is also shocking how poorly balanced the game's mechanics are, and how many game-breaking bugs are present, to the extent that a third party revamp of the game has become massively more popular (on multiplayer at least) than the game itself.
On a more positive note, the game has some of the best shipbuilding/design potential I've seen from a game of this type, and designing a ship perfectly to your liking with the many detailed block shapes and types offered is extremely rewarding. Also, the online PvP is somewhat rewarding and entertaining, although it is extremely rare due to the aforementioned moderator/admin bias, which constantly drives away dedicated pvpers who are tired of watching their friends, and themselves, be treated unfairly.
Once again on the positive side of things, however, the game has some excellently designed POIs and NPC ships/stations, and the challenge of beating them is rewarding and fun early game, but it does quickly become repetitive and far too easy - a major driving factor towards the 3rd party game revamp mentioned earlier (reforged eden). It must also be noted though that these NPC structures are not designed by the developers, rather they are submitted by the game's community.
Overall, the game has a strong shipbuilding aspect and some very nice built in designs, as well as rewarding (although buggy) early gameplay. However, these positives are massively outweighed by a total lack of late game material, and very poorly run official servers and a sub-par moderator team. Furthermore, as a PvP player myself, the blatant bias against PvP is heavily disheartening and frustrating. 
I wouldn't recommend this game as anything more than a semi-cool screenshot generator/basic ship design simulator.",1608754948,1700166660,False,19,2,0.644901037216186523,0,True,False,False

-Save the game because violence could be afoot.
-Stroll boldly into danger.
-Get blown up from predicted violence.
-Try to reload the save you made before strolling boldly into danger.
-Game loads back into a place where you're in the middle of being blown up instead of loading the safe comfy non-exploding backup you expected.
-Exit again and look for safe comfy backup save.
-Safe comfy backup save as well as hours of previous safe comfy backup saves... simply aren't there anymore.

Having played more than 4000 Hours.
Tl:Dr As long as the game treats [b] Capital Vessels [/b] as some sort of oversized space fighters, the game is not of any interest to me. 
(The 4000 hours of gameplay where mostly spend with building stuff in creative mode, not actual play.)

I was patient with this game for several years and had tons of fun just building Spaceships (i tried at least), waiting for the devs to implement game mechanics that would allow us to command big spaceships which we could explore a huge universe with. 

First something positive:
The first ""Phase"" of Gameplay, you are stranded on a Planet, trying to survive, is fun.
The Planets are Gorgeous, you gather ressources, and build a base. Everything great!

Now the negative:
Once you start building a Ship and leave the planet, the game makes a hard turn and becomes not fun anymore. 
1. The restrictions of how you can build a ship are too strict. Ressources and technology limits the size of your ship to something like a slightly bigger as a lifeboat in most Sci fi francises. (the biggest ship you can build is about 300 Meters, BUT you need weeks to gather enough ressources, which makes it rather nonsensical)
2. Technology is a bit confusing and building a decent sized ship becomes a hit or miss:
Weapons: Too specific which ones are effective against one certain type of enemy, while everyting else is pretty much useless. Keep it simple!
Defense: Build ships out of Building blocks and use these as Meat shields against attacks. Bad idea, shice repairing a ship is a nightmare and definitely NOT funn.

2. (Space) Combat is not fun. Especially if you try to fly anything bigger than a XWing sized ship. Turrets fire at anything marked as enemy (you need to set their parameters beforehand) which make something like tactical fighting impossible. Shields are pretty much non existent* and there are no shield facings, which means there is no point in maneuvering/ trying to outmaneuver an enemy ship.
*Classic Sci Fi Shields do not exist. The game has some Game mechanic called shields, but these devices simply enhance the building block Hitpoints. 

3. As already mentioned: Repairing your Ship/Base is a nightmare.



This game had so much potential, especially i am so sick of games where you fly a one seater Spacecraft (Hello NMS) instead of commanding a crew and a decent sized Ship. 
Everything about spaceships in this game is too small scaled, even the NPC ships are laughably small. What's the point of having unlimited possibilities to build spaceships, if the game limits itself for no apparent reason?

It's no just the size of the allowed structures, but also about the existing systems, like weapons (range 1 Km, which would be 3x of a ships length) or the existence of just 2 level shield systems. No matter how much power your ship can generate, you won't have stronger shields than a much smaller ship. Why can't Weapons Power and shields not directly proportional to the generated energy of a ship?

Why do we have to add dozens of various guns and turrets to beat a mid sized enemy NPC ship? Why aren't there bigger and more powerful Guns or (since this is a Sci Fi game) Laser Cannons which damage scales with availlable ships energy?

Why can't our weapons lock on a Target so we can command our turrets WHERE TO SHOOT AT?

Also steering of a big ship is just abysmal, just as the UI in general.",1582860926,1699754060,False,15,5,0.517657637596130371,0,True,False,False

I also just made a new save file. A brand new one with the co-op server function and AGAIN it went to shit and the server would not run again. This kindof makes the game unplayable with friends.

The developer is horribly dated, and has played everyone for 10 years. The only reason this game is a thing at all is because no one else has a clue, either (That's you, Starfield. $70 of trash, that one). Yes, Empyrion can be enjoyable... until it's not. I suggest playing it modded, if you must play it. This review is a thumbs down because of the developer, not the game. Even though it's horribly dated. Did I mention it's way out of date? 

Where has the time gone? Seems like only ten years ago that you crawled your way out of a failed kickstarter and on to Steam Greenlight. And that whole length of time, while you were busy demonstrating that you didn't know what you were doing, you kept up the poser-attitude of a major player. Well, you can fool all of the people some of the time, right? Rate of completion? Heck, my niece went from middle school to college while the development crew was dithering around.  Tell me... are you going to get this game to an actual release before my niece's not-yet-even-thought-of-kids are old enough to play it? Probably not, right?

The game? Well, it's fun... for a while. Until you get bored, because you're doing the same thing over and over again in a seemingly pointless loop because there isn't enough talent to take what was designed as a sandbox and actually flesh out a meaningful storyline to cover what the game has become. The grind is real, though. It's the type of game you can walk away from for a couple of years, and when you come back, virtually nothing has changed. The missing content is still missing. The features... missing, the story... missing. Hours of your life... missing. The graphics are out of date, and that's not likely to ever change given what the developers recently attempted with the water (and the sheer horror that the community experienced). Haven't seen that much fail in one place since the three patches for the durians (now called ""space peppers"").  

Currently, the only thing keeping this title making money at all are a couple of mods which virtually the entire community uses, specifically Reforged. If you like to grind your life away, and like everything nerfed to the point of silliness, that's your mod. Of course, if you know what you're doing, you can walk through the configs adjusting everything yourself. Note that the current most popular workshop builds are compatible with the Reforged mod. 

In conclusion, if you have a lifespan similar to Yoda's, and the patience of a black hole, you may want to buy this game for yourself. Otherwise, just stay away from it. It'll never be worth more than it's selling for now.",1473305555,1699196542,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

and I enjoyed every single minute.

Yeah, it doesn't really feel finished, it's quite rough around the edges and can be janky every now and then and the details in graphics are ""decent"" at best...
But the shaders, lightning and atmosphere is top notch and it feels almost perfect, everywhere you go!


And once you look around it's flaws, it's also ablsolutly rewarding!

SPACE looks beautiful, feels beautiful, plays beautiful...

The learning curve is moderate, the handleing easy.
The game itself can be described at best as something like
""7 days to die"" in space with a blend of No Man's Sky.
But not just like a little brother...
No...
Like... MASSIVE!
The Galaxy in almost endless! with millions of systems and billions of planets to find.
It has populated parts, with factions, trade, diplomacy and wars to fight!
It has POIs like stations, small settlements and dungeons,
it has empty space, THE VOID but also derelict frighters, stations and bases straight from an alien horror movie.

There's so much to say about it, but it's best to give it a try yourself.

Something about Empyrion feels very immersive. I think it's the hunger your character gets, I think it's all the various status effects you can get, the need for oxygen in your space suit. Maybe it's the fact that you can build a ship from a planet surface, fuel it, put whatever parts you want on it, then take off enter the atmosphere and keep going right on up right into space.

Once in space can then warp to a nearby moon for planet in that solar system (with a Small Vessel equipped with a warp drive) . Tons of more people should be playing this but it's a relatively unknown game. It's better than Eve Online, it's better than Starpoint Gemini 2, better than X3: Terran Conflict, better than Star Citizen, and honestly it's better than Bethesda's new Starfield.

They're bugs but personally I've not experienced very many. I once got a terrain bug on one of my bases after I took my single player saved game and went into creative mode, I saved the game before taking myself out of creative mode - when I came back the terrain had changed and my base near water was now not near water. The game developers warn you about this happening when you go into Creative. I've experienced more bugs on multiplayer than single player 'Vanilla' / Default version. Most of the bugs I've experience seem to be server specific, related to quest not completing, or have been around for 5+ years. I only know they've been around that long because I play with a veteran who has played for 6 years.

I look high and low for good games to play. PS5, XBox X, gaming computer are all at my disposal. What do I come back to play during my gaming sessions ? Empyrion Galactic Survival with Reforged Eden mod.

Editing after reaching nearly 500 hours played. I stopped for a while, well over a year, because it was a frustrating experience outside the building and exploring. Combat is still bad. Real bad. I'll be minding my own business, and I'll just die. Next thing you know, there is a ship that wasn't there, that suddenly appears, either the moment I die, or after I am already dead. Then, the ship doesn't move on with a random route, it just sits there and camps my body. Not to mention, NONE of the shots miss when I try to go back to retrieve my gear and loot. Moving full bore doesn't mean jack shit to this AI - You're gonna get hit no matter how fast you go. The only option is to just get out of the range of the turrets, and by then, you're likely screwed. The other side of it is, you won't hear anything spawn. Ship is right over you? No thruster noises at all, so you don't even get a chance to move. I play with headphones turned all the way up, so there is no excuse for it. It's the same thing with smaller mobs. I have things come out of, quite literally, nowhere. Fighting one arachnid, the only one on the area, suddenly, a second one is behind me and kills me because he was there, but he wasn't at the exact same time? Schrodinger's arachnid much?

too much information or menus are dumped onto me for no unexplained reason. 

so i see alien humanoids, but i am just expected to be familiar with them or the names of their factions or they do not matter?

i like the loogistic system feature, that allows you to place things from containers over longer distances, but the user interface is so clicky and i do not like that i basically have to press the shift button constantly playing the game.

over 7k hours warframe took a heavy toll on my pinky finger and i do not seem to be able to rebind functions on the keyboard.

overall this seems to be a barely complete game that needs refinement of gameplay and user interface and also animations.
its one of those game for which i wish i could have given input during the design process to avoid this outcome.",1697847950,1697848102,False,4,0,0.50205761194229126,15,True,False,False

Building fleets with people and absolutely kicking ass with your own homemade ships has this intrinsic value to it that makes things feel far more tightly bound than just a normal multiplayer experience, and things get even more fun when you encounter a good PVP server.

Negatives? The developer is one of those ones that follows the old Nintendo formula: You'll have fun, but it's their definition of fun: Mods to the game's actual code are made very difficult with unnecessary assembly obfuscation (code protection).

The progression and block limitations feel completely arbitrary which ruin any chance of immersion the game may have otherwise had for me. 
The game's performance just keeps getting worse and worse, I used to be able to play this on a now 14 year old Alienware laptop, now my relatively new laptop struggles to run it, while Space Engineers, Fallout 4, and ARK: Survival Evolved run just fine. 
Weapon ranges feel arbitrary and too short, a problem Space Engineers also has, but unlike Space Engineers, you can't fix the problem with mods in Empyrion, not in a reasonably accessible way anyway.
Having large ships and structures as well as hovercraft and small ships be different types of grid makes no sense(like the game's hovercraft in general to be honest), and feels more like a lazy game design choice rather than something with a valid reason to be.
There was once a mechanical drill the player could use, which was removed for no apparent reason.
While Space Engineers also has a few arbitrary feeling block limitations(like having no worthwhile small grid production), that can be fixed with mods, unlike in Empyrion where you get arbitrarily restricted small grid production which isn't even consistent in what it can do from one type of small grid to the other.
For some reason the devs are completely incapable of implementing wheeled vehicles in a way that works at least as well as Space Engineers, in fact the one time a wheeled vehicle was added, it was worse than a game called Planet Explorers, which is impressive considering how basic that game's implementation was.
Combat is as bad as Space Engineers, but with the downside of being something you have to engage in to properly progress in this game.

On to less significant problems I have with the game.
-Player character design is ugly, no exceptions
-The armor is meh looking at best(most of it is ugly)
-The planets/moons are a bit on the small side
-Ore distribution makes no sense(why would you only find a handful of different types of ore on any given planet/moon?) I put this under ""less significant problems"" because it's pretty much the standard at this point.(doesn't make me hate the design choice any less though)
-Survival mechanics could use some improvement such as food lasting longer
-Certain types of weapon/tool should use the same ammo, such as miniguns and sniper rifles or the player portable laser drill and multitool
-Laser drills make absolutely no sense and people should stop including them in ""sci-fi"", they turn science fiction into science fantasy
-Promethium is a weird choice of fuel and I don't see any reason it would be chosen over something more reasonably possible like thorium or neptunium(assuming you aren't willing to use uranium or plutonium for some inexplicable reason)",1485818546,1695066446,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u][b] Gameplay [/b][/u]

You start off on a planet and depending on which starting planet you chose you will be faced with either missions or tasks / tutorial on how to play the game. 
there is a lot of crafting and levelling up to craft and unlike more advanced items in skill tree.
Building a base and vessels to travel explore and survive against other Ai Npc's
There is First Person View and Third Person.



[u][b] Graphics/Frames [/b][/u]

The graphics in the game are so breathtaking from where they were in the beginning . Lighting is better there are more smoother frames but can be buggy at times but no very often.
There also is more features to play around with in the settings that can help stabilise the game-play by tweaking them.


[u][b] Progression [/b][/u]

Well its very simple: Complete missions, kill lifeforms, farming and crafting and resource. Build Capital Vessels, Hover Vessels, Small Vessels and Bases. Also building advanced-weapons and tools. A great skill tree unlocking these additions every time your level goes up from performing tasks and missions. 


[u][b] Final Thoughts [/b][/u]

Still think player model needs a touch up.
Love the large amounts of planets to explore.
Love the shield features.
Better with friends.
Ai has improved very much.
If you want a challenge join one of the HWS servers.

Our personal ships or bases simply disappearing out of the blue. Just to name a few.

Honestly, its the model that all space construction sims should use. You have 100% freedom to design a base, tank, fighter and capital ship that looks and behaves any way you can imagine.

But the best part is space combat. You can blow literal chunks of enemy ships until a lifeless husk remains,  and in return, limping home venting atmosphere with your ship cut in half is equally enjoyable. In any state the worlds and landscapes feel soulful and cinematic, though randomly generated the devs have done a great job of making them always interesting and not repetitive. They don't feel randomly generated.

Now for the cons. The story is really bad, if non-existent. The story and dialogue interface is clunky to the point where its sometimes better to ignore the quests and play sandbox. The player combat is also very flat.

Star Field lets you wonder around a planet with a little laser and collect materials that don't even completely despawn. Mean while in Empyrion you can strip mine a planet to the bed rock and move long to another planet.
Star Field lets you walk around a planet to explore for random materials. In Empyrion you get to get motor bikes, hover bikes, small plane like ships and even large ship to explore a planet. 
Star Field has different cities and raider.... I mean pirate hide outs to find. Empyrion has P.O.I that each bring different sites to see and explore.
Star Field has boring companions with a wonderful amount of dialog for them to use while being used as the Bethesda pack mule.

product description includes ''sandbox , survival'' ignore those two parts the world set up UI for 'explore and survive as you wish' have been crippled to the point it just is another rail road scenario 'narrative novel' style game start
and the survival.. yee , ignore that to resources is also 'rail road' spread out to try strongarm what you do ingame to 'fit' the 'internal thoughts/situation' of the character in the story snippets aka how DARE! you have spent 4 houers getting a small capital ship when the story declared you ran of to the spider temple like an idiot right away and jurry rigged an old interceptor afterwards as your first ship!

soo... think of it more as someone is making effort but lost their way as at the moment its false marketing to sell it with 'sand box , survival' as 'core' words in the description.. since both those aspects is crippled in favor of the 'story' i say gameplay wise its 80% story focuse 10% sandbox/open world 10% survival/build/fight etc these days..

the longer first 'original' ranty/disepointed earlier version when i 'only' played 1000 ish houers rather then my current 2k ish being an owner since REAL early access INVESTOR days

This game is fantastic in a lot of ways, but quite flawed in others.
Having said that, I have spent 580 hours playing it so it's got a lot to offer.
I guess my main complaints are the real bad  AI of the enemy, and the kind of  broken base attacks, (not when they attack you, but  when you attack them) it's either waaaaay too hard, or waaaaaay too easy.
If anything this is a busy work game. Something you can play while you listen to audiobooks or pod casts, etc.
It's cool to see the different planets, it's a lot of fun building new structures and vehicles, and I  would strongly encourage you to build at least a few of your own before going the blue print route.
All in all, this is one of those games that you kind of have to try for yourself. Chances are you'll either like it enough to spend way too much time on, or you'll be bored and frustrated with it quite quickly.

They have put in a band aid for it though and lets you force it to move past. There could be more description on what things do and what they interact with and what they won't interact with. Those are my gripes.
once you figure certain things out the game starts to fall into place. I lie that you can use prefabs or you can build your own. That is great.

Well, so for 4.5 years you name your brain terrorism an alpha.
Why?

[*]You chose first letter of Greek alphabet to disguise your faults?
[*]You just play dumb or consider alpha means early-access?
[*]Game dev in unity has it's own implementation?
[/list]
Steam [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2077482126]gives a clear hint:[/url] either you choose to play public beta, put a code for private beta or ""[i]Opt out of all beta programs[/i]"". Opt out is no synonym for downgrade.

Lucky enough, they've already given a tip on what that means:
[h3]Simply downloading a game one will enjoy a loading screen in windowed mode after ≈ 3 min suggesting to send a bug report[/h3]
Tested on three different PCs with different configuration.
Thought it's my fault, but if you search discussions and reviews, it's quite common. Further search gives out a guide on how to start xD Those who do not follow it are not true ""alpha"" testers and it's a ""minor"" issue.

If you, like me, want to start it, chose some random alpha or ""experimental"" that worked for me.
[h2]What do we experiment on?[/h2]
I prepared myself for the worse, but to my happiness the game ran smoothly, without a single crash.
More to say, without a single bug that could be considered an ""experimental"" issue. Just did the lowest graphics with low resolution, had a flight to the space on a motorbike after doing a mountain salto, minor shader glitches, basically everything that has been discussed earlier and will never be fixed.

[h1]Yet, liked the today game for 16 hours[/h1]
Compared to Space Engineers, who never played childish ""alphas"" and did their final release out of beta last year, this game is lucrative due to exploration. I wanted to visit different star systems, see the newly introduced gas giants, but unfortunately gave up.

Once again, compared to above mentioned competitor with great physics, good online performance and etc. Empyrion has a selling point in PvE which Eleon does not see as competitive advantage and while ruining it puts emphasis on online game. Well, let them sandbox the inevitable, yet PvE is still a strong ace in their hands.

First part of the gameplay in Survival mode on a planet is quite saturate.
There is a nice PDA tutorial on the basics of the game which really helps to get yourself acquainted. During the first few days game arouses interest, you do not have much routine, you get the vital survival items without too much hassle, than you get a bike, the design of which I adored and wish smth like this would be a reality, handling is awful but soon you are introduced to a hover vessel with which traversing the planet is easy as a duck soup.
After the course of action PDA suggests doing some base built with sentry weapons that have a poor angle which comes more of a hindrance than a help, but a mighty shotgun shows those landing forces who eats the pie.

After you get obsessed with building a base and collecting resources, you get invaded with three drones who feel themselves comfortable sweeping away your masterpiece due to sentry guns angle mentioned above and your inventory not shooting high in the sky.

That makes the game challenging and collecting resources once again does not seem like an ugly affair.
But as mentioned by players fair amount of times, NPCs are not the brightest crayon in the box.
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2077530995]Base like this, built over a tunnel to some resources[/url] will serve you well with a single sentry gun, which is overmuch. Just place the ""core"" of your base far beyond the tunnel and NPC will never know about main entrance doing reel off over the top of the hill trying to find their way through the voxel. The only nuisance is that you can not go for a good sleep unless all the rags get shot. So please them, they even will not mind you appearing somewhere from the distance and will continue their sacred core search.

Yet, adventure is not about defending your base, it's about going out!
Here the game shows it's best colors in different flora and fauna, what could be more thrilling than chainsawing a tree and being approached by surprise by some angry dinosaur, that indeed makes fun!
Besides that planet is habitat by various fractions all having their sort of buildings, culture and whatever, you feel yourself living on a busy planet! Assaulting buildings grabs interest by coming across it's employees, security bots, feels like a base! The neutral one even has NPCs doing some jobs, but unfortunately due to game mechanics, unless you [strike]tear your ass[/strike] get yourself deeper into this mechanics without any hint or tutorial, being neutral you'll just watch them.

[h3]And now about [b]unfortunate[/b][/h3]
Part of discoveries are POIs (Point of Interest), and many of them are under fraction alien. Unique buildings find receptive audience and while you feel yourself excited about an abandoned building looking at the shapes, trying to find something, hit it, climb higher, suddenly a scream comes somewhere from the inner side, trying to find out it's source there is an encounter of quite creepy mob which is hard to deal with and says ""nightmare"" as it's name.

Of course I digged the web to find out that it was introduced to those abandoned buildings and will occasionally spawn to make them more challenging. The dev says, it's his nightmare, and finally alien is not that friendly.

Good idea I should say! That encounter made my hands tremble because of a surprise effect and shotgun being not that cool against it.

[h3]But occasionally means ████ing [b]occasionally[/b][/h3]
Screamer is good only once, or [b]occasionally[/b] to make it thrill.
I will dumb down the way things are.
You'll never see this mob from a distance. [b]EVERY[/b] building of alien fraction will spawn it. It does not spawn while you are in any type of transport. As you get to the building close enough and spend a bit of time it will.",1588113963,1693088014,False,2,1,0.449253290891647339,0,True,False,True

I think it's a bit unavoidable given the range of options the game gives you that can cause confusion. If you misplace a block early on you can either use the standard tool for salvage, make a tool that runs out to require ammo that has way higher demands to build than the tool (this is an example of issues in the tech tree and dependency graph) or it turns out there's an undo button in an obscure build menu. However, going further along the game has other problems that still make crafting a huge setback and undo any of the satisfaction it would otherwise provide. This game still relies way too much on the learning curve and it becomes catastrophic when you progress further into the game.

It still needs some spit and polish around small issues, crashes, missing text, typos, resource damage panel not always showing, etc. There are however a few things that just totally ruin the experience.

There isn't a proper design interface for blueprints. I think the only solution might be to go into space with the jet pack in creative mode to build space ships though you then have lighting issues still. This is annoying with ways around but there are some thing that just go too far.

In crafting there's a symmetry tool which sounds great as it should in theory make crafting much easier only it doesn't because there's always at least one plane not properly centred.

What is really infuriating however is a lack of any readouts to be able to construct properly. This includes failing to show anywhere obvious maximum possible power draw. A number of components also don't appear to be very smart such as power generators as far as I can tell always turn on at max.

One of the things that really infuriates me are the arbitrary limits. Speed is limited, I guess in relation to render speeds but in crafting there's no obvious indication of this. The game constrains your designs by hidden factors. This is really infuriating with storage and storage extensions. I just spent ages building a big cube shift in creative to make a blueprint.

I then check the storage to find that they're all capped at 320k. What is the point of this?

Generally speaking, the build system also needs some work including in the dependency tree. It is frustrating to not be able to extend the storage of fridges, to link multiple input boxes including fridges, to extend pentoid tanks, etc. Shield generators also don't let you stack and have multiple. Some of the limits seem pointless or odd. Why only 15 of each solar panel type? Why only ten wireless transmitters? There's already this CPU limit anyway.

This is a game that under the hood had great potential with a powerful build system but when you try to use it you keep hitting walls, it keeps slapping away your hand or punching you in the face. It keeps you on a leash. It then has mechanisms that are questionable and frustrating with a lack of tools again for visibility. Some units can produce heat or radiation. Trying to design a ship around this makes for yet another level of hell.

These limits reach the point of being offensive. I build a capital ship with a massive weapons battery only to find it has a hidden limit of supporting only 11 at once. At this point I simply throw this game down. It completely undermines itself. The point of lego is freedom to build. If you're going to make a lego game but then have endless aggressive and often hidden rules such as you can't use so many of this block then whats the point? This game has destroyed itself in some misguided attempt to achieve balance.

The game needs to fix some of the minor issues so they're less frequent and at least beef up the UI to be able to better avoid headache after headache. The more you play this game the more you realise the developer just wants to defecate in your face. This is not game design. This is a personality disorder. The state of UX betrays a complete absence of empathy or sympathy. I would describe the experience as being at the mercy of a psychopath.

I would highly recommend avoiding this game like the plague. It's yet another of those games that gets released when it's still really in development. You can spend a few hours getting something done and then the game screws up and you have to do it all over again. The attitude of the developers toward their customers is malicious.

To prove the point. The developer didn't like negative feedback on their game so came into the game server, started harassing me and another random player and then permanently banned me destroying days of work after finally getting to a good point.

The developer is unstable and it's not safe to install this game which would give the company access to your computer. You don't know what he might do if you have legitimate problems with the game or the attitude of its developers.",1688893983,1692982772,False,1,4,0.507927656173706055,0,True,False,False

Starbound had all these cool things you could do like build a crew and colonize planets but none of it mattered because the core was completing a series of linear, scripted missions outside of any of the sandbox features.

Empyrion follows a rough progression through 3 building tiers, where tier 1 is just basic survival and base building, tier 2 is basic space travel and tier 3 is advanced ships. The move from tier 1 to 2 is fairly tedious and uninteresting, while the move to tier 3 is unbearable. You need to spend countless hours building, harvesting, shooting, and travelling all over the solar system so you can survive and collect the last batch of resources you need to build your Star Destroyer or whatever. At which point the game is over because there is nothing to do with these big ships.

So the dev's solution to this tedium is, wait for it... linear scripted missions. I kid you not. Instead of learning from the likes of successful sandbox titles like Terraria or Factorio, they are following in the footsteps of one of the biggest disappointments of the genre. Well done sirs.

While you are trying to collect resources you can go to static lifeless towns, talk to silent lifeless NPCs, get tedious boring fetch quests, and do bargain-tier FPS combat. None of the systems in the game really support this design and none of the game's strengths (building, exploring, big spaceships) are really involved in completing these tasks.

What a waste. If I were to salvage this game I would throw the scripted missions in the trash and focus on expanding the sandbox progression systems. Right now there is a leveling system but all it does is unlock recipes and is totally pointless in every way. A better system would be like 7 days to die or Factorio, where all the resources are available from the start but your ability to harvest and refine them is what improves. Or make it like Terraria where each new resource brings a new level of gear, new enemies, new exploration options, and new dangers. Making players spend dozens of hours without feeling the slightest bit of progress is the death knell of this game.

bad: the quest system is horribly broken and videos do not play when running on Linux. Can't blame a small dev for the latter, and you do not really need videos. Enemies are freaking hard, since they always seem to hit and can kill you before you even know where they are firing from.

good: all the rest! A neat survival challenge with some devious twists when you get to other planets. Keeps you on your toes for sure. The crafting system is excellent and pretty deep. You get pre-determined blueprints for many important things like ships and bases, but you can always start with a few blocks and build your own. You can even simply modify a ship built from a blueprint, for example to add other modules.
Exploration feels great and rewarding, because you need to be prepared. Did you remember your oxygen reserves for that poisonous atmosphere? Did you pack radiation medication and painkillers? Got preserved food? Even cool drinks to combat the heat on that desert planet? Good boy! That is, until nightfall, when the temperature drops to -60 C and you realize you also should have brought a heater to this desert...

That said, I have not yet found myself that fits what I am looking for better than this. You may not be buying the game you think you are. With the most unfavorable mechanics turned off by default, you may not even experience the potential headaches the game has to offer on your first pass. 

There are several mechanics that are off by default that can increase the difficulty of building within the game. However, most of those less known mechanics don't result in blueprints that are impractical builds without the corresponding special rules. They tend to only break blueprints built without those special rules in mind.

The real warning I will have currently is that there are essentially two games of Empyrion and the delineation between the two is not always clear. The real danger for a new player is that blueprints built in one version of Empyrion may either not be legal or simply not work as expected in the other version of Empyrion. A great many blueprints in the workshop are built for a mod called Reforged (or Reforged Eden). This mod changes several mechanics and the balance of many devices in the game. In addition, Reforged adds many new blocks that are not legal in the standard, or vanilla, game. So a blueprint built for vanilla may be severely under powered or fail to comply with the Reforged CPU mechanics, while a blueprint for Reforged may have illegal parts as well as fail to comply with the vanilla CPU mechanics. To complicate things, not every blueprint on the workshop is clear whether they were built in the vanilla game or Reforged....",1574361935,1692842590,True,0,0,0.502637565135955811,0,True,False,True

As I recount my expedition through the vast expanse of the game, I'm reminded of the extraordinary evolution that unfolded, from crafting my very first spacecraft to venturing deep into the heart of distant galaxies.

The Genesis: Crafting a Dream in the Stars

My journey began on a forgotten planet, a solitary soul in a universe brimming with potential. Armed with nothing more than determination and a handful of basic resources, I commenced the arduous process of building my first spacecraft. Every piece of metal, every electronic component I collected and assembled felt like a step towards shaping my destiny among the stars.

Breaking the Atmosphere: Launching Toward the Unknown

With a surge of engines and a chorus of adrenaline, I soared into the heavens, leaving behind the planet that had been my cradle. The feeling of breaking free from the gravitational pull was exhilarating, marking a symbolic departure from the familiar and embracing the endless possibilities of the cosmos. As the stars gleamed against the inky backdrop of space, I knew I was on a journey that would redefine my sense of wonder.

To the Moon and Beyond: A Voyage of Discovery

Fixing my gaze upon the moon, I felt the allure of uncharted horizons tugging at my spirit. The lunar surface, though devoid of life, was rich in valuable resources and challenges to conquer. It was here that I truly tasted the thrill of exploration, uncovering hidden caves, investigating anomalies, and navigating treacherous terrain. Each step I took expanded my understanding of the game's mechanics and the universe it contained.

Planet-Hopping: From World to World

A leap from the moon to a neighboring planet became the next step in my odyssey. My spacecraft had evolved, reflecting the technological advancements and personal growth that had transpired. Touching down on a fresh planet's surface, I was greeted by unfamiliar landscapes, indigenous creatures, and untold secrets buried beneath the soil. Each new world was a testament to the developers' dedication to variety and detail, and I reveled in the diverse ecosystems that awaited my exploration.

Exploring the Great Unknown: Navigating Galactic Wonders

Venturing into the galaxy, my horizons expanded into a vast symphony of star systems. Each jump through space unveiled breathtaking celestial wonders – gas giants with swirling storms, molten planets surrounded by fiery rings, and alien moons shrouded in enigma. It was in these moments, surrounded by the beauty and vastness of the cosmos, that I truly grasped the enormity of the game's scope.

Crafting the Unthinkable: From Surviving to Thriving

My spacecraft transformed from a simple vessel into a sophisticated marvel, thanks to relentless upgrading and diligent resource management. Bases that I established on faraway planets became more than just refuges; they were testaments to my perseverance and determination to survive, with intricate structures housing factories, hangars, and farms. The very landscapes I once explored were now marked by my progress, transformed from barren wastelands into thriving outposts.

A Community of Explorers: Sharing the Stars

Empyrion's universe isn't solitary; it's shared with a community of fellow explorers. Connecting with friends and players from around the world added depth to my journey, as we traded resources, collaborated on projects, and undertook monumental missions together. The sense of camaraderie was palpable, and the alliances forged in the digital realm carried the weight of genuine bonds.

Conclusion: A Galactic Epic Unveiled

Empyrion isn't just a game; it's a canvas on which I painted an epic saga of evolution, exploration, and camaraderie. From the humble beginnings of crafting a spacecraft to the awe-inspiring spectacle of navigating the galaxies, every moment was a triumph, every setback a lesson. Empyrion enabled me to not just explore the cosmos but to reshape it, to thrive within it, and to connect with others who shared my passion for the unknown. The universe is vast, and my journey continues, with galaxies yet to be explored, mysteries yet to be unraveled, and friendships yet to be forged among the stars.",1692819005,1692819005,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would say it's more approachable than some of the more heavy engineering type space builders, but not exactly easy to learn either. I like that it gets constant updates, and modding scenarios are top tier.

The weapons and lasers go pew pew. The visuals will make you stare and go wow... etc. It's fun to progress and eventually pilot a full-realized capital vessel. I love that you can build anything with very little restriction. 
You can walk around your ships, and take in the sights of vast galaxies.

The Steam Workshop is awesome. Many people have built amazing creations you can build in your own games. I would recommend this game for people that want a slow burning space simulation. You start out with nothing, and build yourself an empire. Mine, build, fight epic space battles. This game has a lot to love even if it's a bit rough around the edges.

It has the ability to be what it needs to in order to be such a great space exploration/survival/builder, but it just doesn't have what it needs to really feel like it's good. Most of the exploration is finding new planets and new stations, but unless you just happen to come across too much money and a free ship to be able to wander where you please, you'll grow tired of the same sights quickly, and even if you can wander far, you'll find that even the capital planets are just boring. What I mean is: Why does every planet feel like a colony? None of them feel like they have any substance on it. There's no reason to go to a specific planet in a specific system, as you can find the same thing in any other random section of the galaxy. The game's combat isn't even anywhere near what you could call good. All of the AI are essentially aimbots, the moment they ""notice"" you (yes, you can technically sneak, but it's impractical), you are in their crosshair in less than a third of a second, taking immense damage immediately. This doesn't help that there are sometimes DOZENS of enemies thrown into a room doing this exact thing, and apparently the solution is to just make and use rockets, even which I've found to have limited success as even if you hit right next to your target, they can take literally zero damage, among not even be fazed that they just got shot by a rocket-propelled explosive. I mean, the game gives you a sniper rifle, and everything else out-snipes you with any other weapon, to which you can't do anything about because the way they turn or the way they duck (and this issue isn't even exclusive to this game, many FPSs have this problem) means that a well-aimed headshot is .1 second away from missing by an entire meter. I can't even really say this game's got a good ship-building system in place. It kinda works for what the game is, but the game insists that you use creative mode when designing a ship, since every placed block must use a specific tool with specific ammunition to take back, and with how you place blocks sometimes they can just slide a block over causing you to just repeatedly place, pull out your tool, spend 10 seconds mining it, place again, etc.
This game does a lot that other games have already vastly improved upon already, and if this game took a hit from those other myriads of games, it could be the massive success that the game should be. If you're looking for a game to explore, pass on this. If you're looking for a game to do combat, huge pass. If you want to build, it's not terrible, just be wary of the downfalls, and if you can get past those, then this might be good for you.",1692583830,1692583830,False,6,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is ultimately what does this game in. First, the AI is extremely poor - worse than any other modern game. Even compared to other unpolished games like 7 days to die. It even seems worse than some of the first 3D first person shooters like Goldeneye on the Nintendo 64. And then, at the same time, the AI are like aim bots that hit and kill you immediately in a few hits if they have a visible line of sight (sometimes, just one shot, if they have a rocket launcher or similar). So, you constantly need to save the game around every corner otherwise you are constantly dying from a couple of shots, or you have to go through measures to exploit how stupid the AI is (like when they get stuck facing a wall, but their leg is poking out from around the corner and is just visible enough to shoot them), which is not fun at all and completely ruins immersion.

I was playing another survival game in early access (my first) and took to it because I enjoy gathering my own wealth, putting my wealth and knowledge to work, and building my capability to accomplish my goals in the world in which I'm playing.  Resource gathering, especially mining, is very realistic.  You find resources as you pass them, and perhaps soil samples and testing might be a step too far, but you grind away at terra firma digging into the resource and end up with an open pit mine.  That is, until you can produce the technology to employ an auto miner.

Plant resources are also interesting in that they are not marked in any way until you mouse over them within a reasonable interaction distance.  Even the resource that you gather is limited in its description in its usefulness and what it might build.  Storage containers are yours for building without limit to permitted number or cost of production beyond required materials.

Weapons and ammunition make sense, althought there are more ammo types than I feel would be necessary, and having the option to outfit a particular weapon with the type of ammunition that you have would be a welcome change.  I have thousands of rounds of pistol ammo with no sub-machine gun or wall mounted turret available in production to use them.  They don't seem to be recyclable either.  I haven't seen the market system on my solo server, though it does look well designed with a futuristic currency system measured in 'credits'; lootable from dead aliens or minted into coins from gold resources.

You have the choice of first-person verses third person view but with limited camera angle and distance.  Pistol, assault rifle, sniper rifle, laser and pulse weapons are all satisfying in design and expected damage.  I happen to like the mini-gun... the sniper rifle upgrade can drop unarmored aliens and terran food source animals with one headshot.

The building system is much more complex than in the last survival and sand-box game I played.  While blocks, large ones, are one item per block and can be limiting to what you can place where, the number of styles and variations with which you can build is impressive and bordering on complex.  It seems to mirror the same kind of tool kit that they would give a developer to design game elements, only in the hands of the players.

Not only do you get to build your own base, but your own space-worthy vehicles with upgradable weapons, propulsion systems, storage, manufacturing, and life support systems.  Jumping among planets and moons in your current solare system and throughout the galaxy are dynamics of the game for which I have only scratched the surface.  I've played a week, and I haven't given thought to touching another game in my library since I loaded this one.

After more extensive play, venturing much farther into the available universe... I find that the more planetary systems that you visit, the more difficult it is for the game system to save your progress.  It seems that when you hit save, the game attempts to back up everything you have ever done, including systems (like my home system) long ago mastered, and had not been visited in months...  Some game save times ran over three minutes... unbearable.  I was one system from the Zirax home world and simply couldn't bear to back up the game for 5 minutes.  Time to review coding and how the game backs up it's files.  I would suggest that if the system hasn't been updated this session, verifiable by any number of strategies, that the system not bother renewing save information... simply reference it and/or copy it for update during play.

Other than the painful backups, great potential, very fun, and still recommended within limits.

From handheld weapons that do more damage than capital weapons, weapon ranges that aren't even remotely accurate, invulnerable enemy turrets making playing the game in certain places literally impossible, to spawning pirate warships right on top of you whenever you enter a non-pirate station (in high security style systems where pirates don't even exist) destroying your entire ship in only a few moments, long before you ever have a chance to even get to it.

Literally, the majority of the hours on this is just regaining all the materials and items lost to these BS spawns and running back to my corpse because the enemy has been made impervious to damage. 

And on top of the all ground and space combat is absolute garbage. from laser weapons having more recoil than a bloody minigun to rocket launchers that do nothing to any structure regardless, to player turrets doing a fraction of the damage any npc turret does. 

And heaven forbid you get an injury or take a melee hit or get cold or something. You need a backpack filled to the brim with so much esoteric medicines to take care of even the simplest things. get a skin parasite a moment ago? Just let it kill you and continue because if you cure it you will bleed out in a couple seconds. Yes that's right. Tiny little parasite turns into all your arteries at once being sliced open because reasons. There are some basic maladies that require an entire med bay full of machines to cure because everything and their dog causes other deadly illnesses when cured for no god damn reason.

The devs have absolutely no clue what QA is.

Quite literally the only thing this game has going for it at this point is ship building. THAT'S IT.

Even the terrain generation is wonky.


Update as of august 9/23:
Still a shitshow. Nothing's fixed and even more crap's broken.
Started a new game and I lost count of how many times i fell through the ground. This particular issue is new, too....

Oh. And grass is legit bullet proof now (or maybe always was, IDK and can't muster up enough of a shit to care which.) Killed repeatably by 3 baby scorpions because they were hiding in the grass and could therefor not be shot. I shot at them and I got the audio of bullets hitting wood, the visual of bullets hitting wood, and my own @55 eaten because while grass is bullet proof it doesn't stop melee from enemies. Enemies that have a melee range more than 5 times greater than their own body length....

The kicker?

I had already harvested the damn grass. There wasn't even a model or mesh of any kind for my bullets to hit... Just an invisible hitbox comprised of hot, greasy incompetence.

I legit sat here for a solid minute wondering which portion of the janitor's lunch they had coding this.

Then there's the new hover bike! I don't even have words to describe how poorly this thing handles. And if even a pixel of it touches water it stops dead and can't be used anymore until you manually pick it up and then place it again.

Shots still sometimes don't even register when you point blank so hard you're gun barrel is almost just a giant neuron for them, or even when you're 5 feet away... You reload your weapon and go through the whole horrible as balls animation for it and have to do it again because it reloaded 0 ammunition...

Empyrion has maybe great ideas. Putting them into reality is where it fails. The interface to this game hates you - with a vengeance. So does the game loop. And it crashes a lot. The game does everything to get in your way: every task is needlessly convoluted, complex, requires silly steps, or has some needless restrictions - it feels plain janky. Inventories have interactive slots to 'drop' and 'trash' items - *that* kind of janky. Inventories meticulously track every gram you carry - except the couple of tons in your belt that can include a hoverbike, or a virtual factory in your backpack that carries hundreds of tons of ore. So inventories are completely nonsensical, and just there to annoy you. Quality of Life? Not here. 
Let's say you as a new player want to build a box - a common task for most crafting games. First you gather the resources and then start building. And then you'll find out that the box that you just crafted doesn't fit in your inventory. Oh, and you can't place it on the ground because there is no base nearby. Wait, you didn't know that you need a base to place a box? Sucks to be you, I guess. So, drop it, and it de-spawns after 3 minutes. You know, fun - Empyrion style. 

So, let's do the smart thing and follow the built-in tutorial. There are two of those: a built-in tutorial accessible for normal play, and a dedicated tutorial scenario. I tried the scenario first. That tutorial, after a series of corny exposure and a rather silly parade of bugs stopped working a while. Janky. Oh, and it crashes a LOT.

So, I started a normal play-through, and activated the tutorial. The built-in tutorial (not tut scenario) is  ""Janky Central"". Its ""Base"" tutorial page two talks about ""the hovercraft"". Which hovercraft? Well, the one it didn't talk about before. Yeah, that's Empyrion for you: find out how long you can take this crap before you bug out. And let's not forget the incredibly convoluted way that you can re-call past messages. This gives new meaning to user-hostility. Jaaaaaaaankyyyy!

So try to I build a base. Read the tutrial (the one that talks about the hover bike), and followed the instructions. Followed the recommendation to use wood or carbon as building material. Started production in a virtual factory that somehow travels with me. Only to find out that gathering that much wood is likely to take hours. So, I cancel the production... Ah, no cancel option. The apparently accepted way to cancel a running production is to simply start another one, with the materials that you have delivered mysteriously not taking up any space nor weight, and those that you had put into the virtual 'factory' remaining there inaccessible. Jaaaaaaaankyyyy!

I finally get my first base constructed and spawn it. Only to find out that it is now half buried. No problem - I go inside, and spend the next 10 minutes clearing it out with my respource collector. Jaaaaaaaankyyyy!

Then some time later I find out that I did not actually built a base, just a structure, and that the entire base mechanics in this game functions completely differently, it revolves around ""cores""... How did I find out? By scouring the internet. I was already hours into this game, and had to re-start. Feels janky to me.. 

So, how janky are we talking? Here's how: The hoverbike? That thing can only hover over *land*. If you happen to cross water, it separates from you, and you are dropped under water. Why? It just does. Sense? Not here, mate - this is Empyrion: arbitrary nusiance as game elements! How did I find out? Well, the tutorial (scenario) said: ""This is shallow water, your hoverbike should be able to skim it"". It doesn't. Good tutorial.

And that is the crux of the matter. You need to already know how to play Empyrion in order to understand the tutorials, nothing is sufficiently explained. How cargo boxes work, how to rename them, what cores are, how do to use them, and why? You either already know or won't understand the tutorial - there's no obvious way to discover things, and the tutorial is singularly inept in guiding you

My grandfather used to say 'never assume malice where simple incompetence suffices'. Empyrion badly tests this advice. I have never before encountered a level of such user hostility and haphazardly slapped together game elements that wasn't malice.

It scratches a very specific itch that few other games even [i]attempt[/i]. But this one is just so poorly executed it's an absolute do-not-recommended even if there are still some things about it I enjoy.

What I like: you start from nothing on an alien planet and, slowly but surely, end up building the stuff you need to explore an entire galaxy. There are hostile forces that give you a reason to actually [i]defend[/i] what you make, which so many other builder games never even bother to do. An explorer's dream come true, complete with ground/space/vehicle/infantry combat, resource gathering, crafting, trade and faction relations, etc etc etc. So what's wrong?

In short... everything. Literally [i]everything[/i] in this game is just [i]bad[/i] in some way or another. There's just barely enough done adequately enough to keep you around, hoping that once you get through X slog that Y phase will be better, but it just never is.


Firstly -- and I cannot stress this enough -- [b]this game is still an alpha.[/b] I don't care if they're calling it released; it's not done. Not even close.


Visuals: can be decent at their best. Mostly they look unfinished, hideous at worst, and average somewhere between.

Too little variety. You'll see the exact same models for resource deposits on every single planet in the entire galaxy. One per mineral. With vegetation, you'll sometimes get a few different models, but no variation whatsoever model-to-model, not even slightly randomized sizing. Something as basic as Object.DrawScale *= randrange(0.9, 1.1) is all it would take to add even the faintest hint of variety and they didn't even do that. No palette swaps, no alternative models, nothing.

The UI is a mess. Animations are terrible across the board. Textures are passable, but there's far too few of them. If an intern spent a month cranking out generic scifi textures using Gimp tutorials the game's texture library could easily expand ten times over with little effort and still meet or exceed the quality of the existing assets.

""Placeholder"" Unity asset store garbage is everywhere. Why are there dinosaurs in the Andromeda galaxy? Why are they on every other planet? One word: laziness.


Sound: mostly horrible. Canned ambient sounds, including a repeating wolf howl on loop ALL NIGHT LONG on some planets. REALLY bad volume levels. And then there's that [i]fucking UI alert noise[/i] that plays CONSTANTLY from all sorts of messages that pop up, and you can't mute it. It's especially bad while raiding enemy POIs. Endless ""You can't damage that block with this weapon!"" alerts from stray shots causing those BLURK noises over and fucking [i]OVER[/i] again. I ended up modding all the weapons to be capable of doing some tiny amount of block damage solely to get that fucking message to stop showing up all the goddamn time. It was [i]that[/i] bad. But that only cut out [i]some[/i] of the message spam.

If you could mod the audio and fix it yourself, I'd be willing to give these issues a pass. But you can't.


Combat: OK at best, horrible at worst. Spongey enemies, weak weapons, slow reloads, reloads you MUST let finish (including idle frames) or the whole thing gets cancelled, vehicle weapons that cannot be reloaded in the background if you switch to another weapon, heavy reliance on auto-targeting turrets with really poor targeting AI, abysmal POI level design with enemies that can literally spawn right on top of you (and I do mean literally, [i]literally[/i] ON your head), drone aircraft that can and will be stunlocked if you shoot them with anything at all (including a pistol), the list goes on. Oh, and [b][i]120m draw distance for infantry[/i][/b]. That's IT. What. the. fuck. Why are sniper rifles even in this game?

There is no EWAR or ELINT to speak of, so you can easily be ambushed by enemy ships appearing out of nowhere unless you constantly spam-ping the detector (manually, with a short range and duration). No always-on sensor systems to give you any sort of early warning, so it's incredibly easy to be jumped while mining or exploring, especially in space.


Base attacks are especially bad. When you build a base, a timer starts counting down, and when it hits zero, an enemy will send a strike force. Great concept, but...

For one thing, the attacks themselves are inconsistent. A late-game base with a massive arsenal of anti-air weapons may be visited by a single unarmed troop transport or a lone gunship. Or, your starter base with four anti-infantry turrets and nothing else could be attacked by an entire squadron of 15+ gunships and 4-6 transports, each of which can unload like 20 troops that, despite having largely bullet-based weapons, can shoot apart solid steel or concrete blocks in seconds.

But the real kicker? By far the dumbest mechanic I have ever seen in any game of this ilk: core hacking.

If the enemy AI can't find an ""easy"" path to your base's core, they can just telefrag it from OUTSIDE YOUR BASE, INSTANTLY, WITH NO WARNING WHATSOEVER, AND IMMEDIATELY TAKE OVER YOUR ENTIRE BASE, INCLUDING YOUR TURRETS. They replace your core with theirs and your base becomes theirs. You can't just destroy their core and put a new one back if you thought ahead and made spares; it keeps reinstalling their core automatically, immediately after killing theirs, over and over again -- unless you kill every single one of the remaining troops. Sometimes even that isn't enough, and killing every last soldier won't stop it, and you're just screwed. Hope you have a save backup from not too long ago!

What the [i]actual fuck[/i], Eleon? This is by far the laziest possible solution to ""players made their cores too secure, so we needed to overcome it somehow"" I could have ever imagined, and it in turn encourages even dumber cheese strategies to avoid the hacks. I'm not even fundamentally opposed to the concept, but like... give me a warning message on the HUD with a progress bar or SOMETHING for fuck's sake. Give me a chance to stop it. Give me the ability to build expensive countermeasures to slow or prevent hacks outright. Or just, you know... try to make the AI pathfinding not as dog balls? Or maybe give the infantry squads some anti-tank weapons so they have to blow open the base the old fashioned way? SOMETHING other than this absolute trash fire.

If that wasn't enough, half the time the enemy soldiers that do unload and insta-cap your base will then just... stand there, not moving or even reacting when you shoot them. They are either impossibly competent or completely useless.

Oh, and nothing else shows up. It's either drones or troop transports or both. No tanks, no fighters, no capital vessels. Maybe a pair of light bombers, but nothing interesting. Expecting a big combined arms siege? Look elsewhere.


There are loads of other problems with this game. Too many to list. If you really want to try it, there are worse ways to blow 20 bucks, and like I said, it's [i]not all bad.[/i] There is a solid core gameplay loop here. If there wasn't, I wouldn't have put in 40 hours, let alone 400. But it's constantly let down by lazy, sloppy, or just incompetent execution. And judging by the game's history, the odds aren't good Eleon will actually polish this up.

If you can deal with jank and baffling design decisions, this could, maybe, be a game for you. It offers immense potential for creativity, especially when it comes to designing vehicles. But as a survival game, as a FPS, as a flight sim, as a tower/base defense game -- as all the other stuff this one is trying to be -- it falls flat.

The Dev team for this game is amazing.  They communicate well, patch bugs regularly and are still adding new features into the game.  Easily one of the best EA's I've ever played.

Gameplay:  This feels like Ark Survival in space where instead of dinos you get spaceships, hovercraft, and small vehicles (fighters/transports).  Multiplayer you can join with friends to make a faction and attempt to take over PvP sectors (a lot of fun and teamwork required).  Singleplayer is pretty fun too as it gives you more of a ""lone survivor"" feeling.

I reference Ark, but don't be turned away if your experience with that game has been bad.  That game is filled with bugs and the dev team isn't that responsive and the game is becoming a DLC moneypit.  Empyrion's Dev team couldn't be further than that and I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a solid sci-fi survival game.

2023 Review Update

The game starts you as a survivor on a base and you gotta build up till you are roaming a galaxy with hundreds of stars each with multiple planets, moons and poi.  There are many things about the game that are unpolished, the ai can be stupid at times, the graphics quality is so so, there isn't collision damage, the quest system is buggy and doesn't work well for multiplayer, and so on.  

However the game gets so many things right that it's hard to stop.  The worlds and systems are diverse and look varied.  Lighting, atmosphere and general appears can be very nice.   The variety of POIs and the difficulty is also very high.  Some are small but some are huge dungeons.  While the AI isn't the brightest bulb it hits hard and is definitely a threat and isn't dependably stupid.  So going into a POI isn't a cake walk.  The game progression is also good.   Initially you starts on a variety of different worlds or scenarios with varied difficulty.  Tutorial quest is pretty good to get you started and there is a story line and quests that lead you on.  To address bugginess you can advance a quest by checking the progress task list complete. 

What I love is exploring, finding cool POIs to do, building my base and ships and advancing into the galaxy.  I've not found any other game that really gives me the same sense of scope, exploration and adventure.  There are also some amazing scenarios or reworks for the game.  Reforged Eden really makes the game much more varied and challenging.

For me this game is compelling and enjoyable

- Incredible building system. Likely the best in the genre for how expansive but also not overwhelming it is.
- Solid early game
- Great mid-game, my personal favorite portion and is defined by acquiring your first real vessels ans starting to explore and raid POI's
- Extensive workshop if your are not a great builder yourself
- The ""Reforged Eden"" mod exists and fixes most of the game's problems
- Responsive developers
- Regular updates
- Several scenarios to go alongside the base-game experience to keep the game fresh

Cons:
- Lackluster and boring end-game
- Workshop generally only works for creations and not mods though there are exceptions
- Reforged Eden isn't base-game

Neutral:
- The game-play changes alongside your progression. This is in a somewhat similar vein to ""Ark Survival Evolved"" but in this game you start off surviving and scrounging together resources until you get your initial vessels/base, then building up and beginning to thrive, then exploring and fighting to claim better and more advanced resources, until finally pushing into end-game which has the game become more akin to a shooter than a survival game. If you enjoy that kind of dynamism this is certainly a game you'll get your moneys worth out of. If dynamic game-play puts you off you will still likely enjoy the game just not as much.


Definitely worth a buy and a play-through or two in vanilla before switching to playing Reforged Eden for a significantly better and full experience. Also a significant proportion of the workshop builds only work in either vanilla or Reforged Eden as the two have different design constraints.

It has a lot of cool concepts... being able to explore and fight on foot, as well as being able to build your own vehicles and bases (using a voxel/minecraft system) to do the same both planet side and in space, but it feels like for everything they have in the game, it's only half complete/rather buggy.

Fighting on foot is mediocre, but the AI is rather dumb (often getting stuck in corners, not realizing it's being shot from a long distance) but if it does realize you're there, it's an aim-bot (perfect accuracy from any range, no matter how small of a cross section you've exposed).  NPCs can often also clip into walls, becoming unshootable, but they can still shoot you.  Or tall NPCs that can melee you from the level below.  Weapon balance is also wonky as higher level weapons actually do less damage per shot (sometimes by as much as 50%) while having an increased rate of fire and marginally bigger clips.  So yes, they have an increased DPS, but at the cost of double the ammunition which is obtained 80% through crafting or purchase.  Oh, and they've set up many of the places that you fight through on foot with enemies that spawn directly in front... or behind... you out of thin air.  Even large enemies.

The building system is also only passable.  Yes, you can place any blocks you want, building whatever you want, but it is very basic in concept, restricting you to a very rigid grid system for block placement.  As such, small decoratives, like lights, forcefields, plants, ladders, etc, that should be able to conceivably occupy the same grid space cannot.  You also have no ability to see or manipulate (such as repair or upgrade) blocks that are completely behind other blocks, no way of knowing what blocks may have been destroyed on your craft, and the only way to remove blocks is via a tool powered by a resource (despite being able to freely place blocks by hand).

All ships reach a (rather slow) terminal velocity while falling, and there is no fall/ram damage of any kind for vehicles.  You can float powerless in low orbit forever.  Oh, and you can't walk on a moving vessel, with or without gravity.  You'll be thrown back against rear bulkheads, and often will just phase right through, being left behind.

There is no underwater travel with the ships or underwater building of bases.  I mean, you can build an underwater base, I suppose, but it'll be full of water.  No way to remove the water from inside your base.

There is no AI for the player outside of turrets.  You can't make ships and then hire NPCs to crew and fly them.  And this is despite the game letting you build as many vessels and bases as your little heart desires.

There is only extremely basic automation for crafting.  If you try building something that has dependencies on parts that you don't have enough of, it will automatically queue these up for you.  But you can't tell it to keep a stock level of something (such as bullets for turrets) or automatically refuel, meaning you essentially have to do everything manually yourself.

Graphics and dialogs, as well as their PDA/mission system, all look and feel circa early 2000 game style.

There are numerous other inconsistencies (such as the hoverbike not being able to fly over water despite all other hover tech being able to) and bugs (such as missions breaking and not working right because you explored a mission critical location before the mission sent you there, or the whole location just simply not spawning in) besides.

I really like a lot of the concepts and think this game had great potential, but feel as though it is lacking hard on everything, especially for something that is supposed to be out of EA status (meaning it's feature complete in the dev's eyes).",1690244026,1690246221,False,81,6,0.7462882399559021,0,True,False,False

At it's core it's a great game if you just look at what it does, it simulates an entire galaxy with hundreds of startups, realistic systems full of planets/asteroids, everything to ""scale"" and visit, especially planets where you have weather POIs and different biomes. Plus ship-building with systems, turrets, etc.

Now the bad part is that this is the core and anything else attached smells so bad. The gun-play sucks, the models (be it animals, NPCs, etc) suck, the survival aspect sucks, the AI IS HARD, and the exploration feels like a chore.

When I say crappy I REALLY MEAN it, for example the ground based gun-play is as horrible as it gets, the AI never misses a shot behind you and is homing in on your location through walls, there's basically no real AI, it's the definition of stat checking but you always lose by default and so many other aspects are just as damn hard….

But why thumbs up? because there are potential if not in the development team in the mod developer, truth be told, I don't think this game would be alive if Reforged Eden wasn't a thing adding content and improving the core game where it can.

With that said, I decided to try Empyrion again today, figured why not, its been long enough and the tutorial is much better than before and it keeps the attention as well. I'm more of a controller type of gamer, never really liked key board and mouse to be honest but i decided to give it a go and find that using key board and mouse while playing Empyrion, is actually easy enough once you get the hang of it and how they ease you into the game with the tutorial, you pick up the controls fairly quickly. Overall based on my game play experience and watching a close friend play Empyrion almost every day, its a good solid game worth picking up and adding to the library and if your anything like i am, than it may take a small bit of getting use to how some of the designs are done but over all the graphics are beautiful.

Look it up online, the community hates how this game saves. If you don't mind it.. GREAT! now shut up and go away lol. Fixing the save game system does not affect you. Were the game to be much more error-free, then I wouldn't mind as much but the game is far too buggy to have such a terrible save system.

I most certainly did, for a very long time.  However, ongoing development decisions over the last few years have ""rendered"" the game less enjoyable for me, culminating in making it literally unplayable.

My personal modding of the game has compensated for some of that frustration, but it can't compensate for the graphic additions that stress my hardware beyond what is playable.  Additions like added texture reflectivity, volumetric lighting, and most recently terrain tessellation, dynamic shadowing, and ""global illumination"", have savaged the framerate and made the game visually unplayable.

This misplaced focus on visual eye candy has also meant a distraction from refining existing gameplay elements and UI and fixing bugs that have existed for years.  After eight or more years in development, you might reasonably expect those issues to be under the bridge now, but they aren't.  It's been a conscious refusal to deal with them in favor of adding yet more content that can be broken (and has been).  Perhaps, in the matter of refinements, it's simply a lack of insight or skill on their part, but they've had insightful players like me suggesting those refinements for years and they've chosen to ignore the suggestions.

I already had most of the other graphic options minimized or disabled.  Even allegedly disabling those last three features doesn't restore the 60 FPS that I once enjoyed and consider essential for games like this to be playable.  If I was desperate enough, I could recover most or all of that framerate loss by sacrificing my monitor's native resolution and playing with only 60% or less of it in fullscreen, but I chose the monitor that I did because its native resolution is how I want to play games... and that choice continues to be playable with other games.

I have no interest in spending thousands of dollars on a speculative top-of-the-line hardware upgrade that might or might not solve the playability issue for this game, nor am I interested in crippling the game's display resolution in addition to disabling most of the eye candy with options.  The game appears to still be playable for people who didn't opt for a high-resolution display as I did 5+ years ago when I assembled systems for my wife and I.  I spent considerably more money for those at the time, in spite of a deal, than we could truly afford, but it was part of my effort to future-proof them.  That future-proofing has now failed specifically with this game.  I'm shut out now unless I abandon the native resolution, which I won't do.

In short, in recent years the game's development has included considerable graphic eye candy that adds little improvement to the actual gameplay and stresses hardware beyond what is playable for many people.  It's no longer playable for me.",1689113466,1689888988,False,11,0,0.536643683910369873,0,True,False,False

The game is lifeless, the NPC's you encounter are so poorly animated its actually funny Most of them just stand there with their mouth open while they spew a page of dialog you have to read as there's no VA for the one storyline quest the game has. 

The Main quest line is basically fly\run point to point with some occasional NPC's to shoot at often literally spawning in-front of you often multiple times, with no immersion taking into account at all. Once your done with this easy point to point questline there's nothing else left to do in the game.

This is without getting into other issues with the game which I'll list below.

I'll start with the graphics.

There not great, for how much gpu usage the game demands. The game looks Like Star Wars Galaxies if you ever played that. A old Direct X 8 game, yet this game will max a 2070 at 100% gpu usage and cause it throttle ontop of it all. It's Devs don't  seem to care about optimization at all. Infact the recent update made the game run worse while barely giving it a graphical upgrade! 
You used to be able to run this game at 1440p on a 2070 at 75-90fps, now you need to drop the res to 1600x900 to do the same thing, as they changed the lighting scheme to something that barely makes a difference to the image quality but  requires more horsepower, and still looks the same as an old DX8 game but a bit more shiny like they upgraded it to DX9 and added HDR. It's a real sad joke how bad this game runs. Especially on the swamp planets.

Issue 2 

The game constantly writes to your primary user folder, which is usually on your C:\ drive, for constant saving, instead of just letting you save when you want, With no option to turn this off either. Depending on your cluster size your looking at 3-6mb a minute of writes destroying your NAND flash on your SSD for no good reason at all. This is a Destructive mistake by the developer and they don't seem to care and it should be fixed especially with how bad modern SSD's have become with their endurance.

The Third issue is the Sound positioning, its all over the place, mostly in your face even if the enemy is through 2 walls and 15 ft away. You are gonna hear them breathing like there right next to you. Not to mention world outdoor sound effects that follow you inside. This also sometimes includes things that are not sound effects like fog.

And the Final issue like with what I started with, is lack of real content and very bad looking npc's that have animation quality right out of a early Direct X 3 or PSX game.

Just avoid this game, its idea's look awesome but its execution is terrible.",1688996524,1689102804,False,9,0,0.537281930446624756,0,True,False,False

As a space engineer's  player, I was drawn to this game because it has a story line. Unfortunately the writing is poor and the delivery is not great either. Graphics feel like they are a decade old and the building system is quite annoying. I wish at least that was on par with space engineers where you can place scaffold blocks and then build, but that is rather a preferential issue.
The worst part for me is AI and animation. One example is when AI controlled ships move at light speed, back and forth, between two points.
This game is made in Unity and there are so many assets out there that could vastly improve this game. I am left wondering why aren't they being used?

The good part of this game is that the universe does trick you into feeling that there is life and that you are not alone. The blueprint system that allows one to quickly start building (and repairing) is also well done.

They always hit their target and easily destroy what took hours of gameplay to build. When you lose a vehicle, those resources are gone forever.

Credit where credit is due, the developers are working on it, but their direction doesn't seem very right. Still some fun things in the game, but it's held back by so many aspects.

Going from enemies that can snipe you at max range through foliage and kill you within less than a second they see you, to levels actually becoming a grind to get if you want to put a drill on your SV. The buggy and incredibly questionable enemies, to the incredibly annoying high damage and high numbers they swarm you at. To the annoying armor system that lets you craft only light armor, to the annoying hunger system. To the annoying oxygen system where your screen will turn into a red haze without warning if you keep your eye off it for a second. To the even more annoying armor system, where having armor equipped punishes you by lowering your jetpack's usefulness and makes you need food at an even more absurd rate than default. To the insanely annoying debuffs that most enemies have a 100% chance rate of applying on hit, that require an expensive item to fix. To the guns that feel like crap (Mag-dumping a small turret at closest proximity isn't enough to break it). To the absurd eating sounds, and questionable crafting recipes of just about everything in the game. To the incredibly strange progression system.

There is still a huge lack of direction in the game, and 8 major versions later, none of the base issues were ever addressed.

There is no consistency, building in survival will have you spend a lot of time having to cater for oxygen and hunger, because they go down too fast. Enemies are still imbalanced, turning around a new corner or entering a new room can have enemies spawn directly ON you. No indicator of armor being broken, enemies deal too much damage. Status effects are absurd. Building in space, the best way to build so you can use all three dimensions, is heavily discouraged, due to having a high requirements to be able to float around in space without dying, combined with the constant high flow of food and oxygen.",1551681392,1688793746,False,0,0,0,4,True,False,False

No one.

But after 55 hours of bugs, a few crashes, and a bunch of ""I really don't get it."" Moment's, its a thumbs down.

Good:
-really open sandbox.
-very cool concepts of building/survival/pew pew pew in outter space. 
-really nice community. sorta.
-If you'r into it, a really complex crafting system. Want to spend the next 2 days gathering and crafting? Step right on up.
-cool spaceships/bases
-premade ships/bases if your confused/really confused about the crafting system.

Bad:
-The UI is hilariously terrible and it has the graphics to match it. It's all big, sloppy, and look's like the developers haven't heard of anything past 800x600 in size and graphical terms. In fact, run the game at 800x600, you'll most likely enjoy it more.
-long load times. grab a good book to read.
-Maybe im getting older but the crafting is complex/wtfisthis overboard. just when you thought your ready to put a fuel tank on a ship, you need to spend 4 more hours trying to guess what subgroup it goes to and what day of the week it prefer's to work on. 
-space combat is janky. same with ground combat.

Not a terrible game, but there's quite a few glaring problems.

Sorry, Empyrion. Maybe down the road you'll be the great space game i always wanted.

Maabuss.


*EDIT*  After another 500 or so hours, and a year of development, it has gotten better.   The pathfinding is not great, but it's improved, the collision is *slightly* better and you fall through terrain less often, but several needed features are still either incomplete or in development.  They *JUST* within the last 6 months or iirc, so gave you the ability to crouch as an example.   There is still no collision on ships when they are moving so you can't stand around on a ship while it's in motion, and there is still the HUGE problem of a big CV being an ""I Win"" button.

The story is rich and worth taking the time to do. The possibilities are endless. You spend the first few days exploring on foot, collecting resources to upgrade to a motorcycle. Soon you find different parts of the missions will have you in beat up hover bikes, but that opens up a whole new world. Hover crafts soon become small space craft that let you traverse the massive planet you start on. It becomes time to build a base to store all your valuables and material resources you need to progress. Once the base is in place, its time to head back into the missions / instances / dungeons. Oh, make sure your base has some defense, because the Zirax will be trying to take out the power core from time to time.

As you explore area after area, coming away with a new item or component, this will allow you to build better items, bases, ships, tools and weapons. Eventually you build miners & harvesters so you can collect larger amounts of raw materials. Eventually you have enough to build your first small but warp capable spaceship. You can now leave the atmosphere and explore the planets / anomalies / stations in your solar system. This will allow you to find new materials & items to start thinking about a capital ship your small vessel can park on so you can experience new solar systems.

The game keeps going and going. It's not perfect, but there really isn't anything out there that can do what this can and has been doing for years.

But be prepared to run into ALLLOT of really obnoxious and annoying bugs that have been around since i have started to play, will list them out below. Updates are slow to come out which is unfortunate. The amount of building, combat, and farming can lead to 100s of hours of entertainment. The games core design is really good but i can say it really need polishing. Graphically the game is pretty decent. 

Examples of bugs i mentioned above:
-Enemy Ships will just spin in place after being destroyed and making it nearly impossible to loot. You have to salvage your way to loot. (more often than not)
-Labeling devices such as cargo boxes takes several attempts in order to get the name chosen to stick. Will revert back to its original name 4-5 times. (literally always)
-enemies in POIs will spawn in the walls or floors and be able to kill you but you cant hit them unless you destroy blocks trying to find them. (every so often)
-Invisible blocks will physically block you from going through. Happens with every ship i try to loot. (EXTREMELY ANNOYING)
-the fact you cant separate asteroids from re spawning without enabling re spawn of POIs in settings is annoying.
-laser weapons like tool turrets will show energy beam even tho your not evening using them.
-Multi tool Turrets impact vs where the beam is don't match up. (little annoying)
-LCD text box gets messed up when your adding text and then nothing lines up. IE when you click in box to delete something and hit backspace, a different letter down the row will be deleted instead.

Overall its a really fun game as i said before and worth playing. Just know it needs some polishing to reach its full potential.

I still recommend the game, and I see movement by the devs, which is generally centered around adding more things to the game. Instead of that, they should be fixing existing bugs that have been around a long time and should be easy to fix. Just to name a few:

1) The fact that Gold and Promethium mines always display 100% ore left even when they are empty
2) The fact that wreckage still stay listed on the map, even if you've 100% scrapped them and there's nothing there
3) That energy bars in your personal crafting inventory never perish
4) The AI enemies haven't been touched for literally years and is absolutely terrible
5) Not enough traders, poor trading mechanic - you can only sell them what they sell themselves
6) The quests have tons of errors that crash the game
7) color/texture tool behaves differently for different material types
8) The teleporter uses so much power that its basically useless 

The devs decision to re-create the player starting conditions is just nonsensical. It serves no purpose, and actually diminishes gameplay. There are too many balance and pacing issues, especially since the introduction of the four new starter worlds. In my opinion the game was may more fun before then, having a nice even flow of missions to teach you about the game mechanics and a reason to create your initial base to fend off enemy attacks.These new starter worlds have no real threats to keep players engaged, and a boring storyline that neither teaches nor engages players. 
Instead of focusing their attention at the start of the game, they could have added much more padding and fleshed out the quests and storyline and provided some kind of end-game. To my knowledge, they didn't do that, and the game is still in essentially the same state that was in years ago. 

The crafting system does not keep players engaged. The supply chain is large, and could easily be spread out over 10+ crafting stations to give players the need to create larger bases and give a sense of achievement and diversity. As it stands now, almost all of the station/ship creation is just about roleplaying and aesthetics. Even in the late game, you rarely need more than a handful of cargo boxes or fridges to hold all of your stuff. This could be resolved if the cargo capacities were diminished and properly tiered, as the crafting stations are. 

Overall, this game is mostly about playing in Creative mode, designing bases and ships and roleplaying on your own. There is no actual need to create bases on any planets or in space, and hovercraft and small vessels have little utility. Capital Vessels are the only craft really worth building, but since there is only a crumb of a storyline, you really don't need to spend 50 hours designing and building some huge dreadnought to take on the enemy. There is also no real purpose in exploring the galaxy, as by mid-game you will be swimming in resources. Space battles also have little value to the player other than just to do it. 

And therein lies the issue with Empyrion -- there is a lot to build in this game which is limited only by your imagination, but no reason to do it. Its actually far more efficient just to tunnel your way under an enemy base by hand and use explosives to gain entrance than to build some massive ship to try and fight the base, having to back away every minute to regain shields while the enemy soaks all your ammo. 
Bad design decisions, devs.

Short clarification before I go on: I play exclusively with mods (mostly Reforged Eden) and on fairly populated servers. This alleviates some of the following problems.

Negative points that might keep you away (and why they don't bother me that much):

1. Huge sandbox that's mostly empty or copy/paste. Eh. So, this is a sandbox game. Many people don't like it. I myself don't usually like that. Yes, you have a lot of points of interest and fairly different planets, but once you've seen one type, you've seen them all. BUT, for some reason, I didn't really care this time. Because there was enough to discover to have kept me engaged for a long time in the beginning and once I knew where things were, I could go and get what I needed.

2. Long ways to travel where nothing happens. Well, to be honest, that's kind of subjective. For me, the time it takes to travel to certain points is near perfect. Not too short to make the universe to feel small and not too long to become tedious. The planets are fairly small either. That might break the immersion but makes the whole experience smoother. Your experience may differ.

3. Weird restrictions due to programming/engine limitations (?) 
3.1 Planets are not round, they are more like cylinders, you can not fly over the poles. 
3.2 Travel speed has a maximum that is the same for each type of craft. 
3.3 You can not stand up and move around in a moving vehicle (well, technically you can but you'll glitch through the floor and die a slow death).
3.4 Some more, but minor things. 
These were nearly immersion-breaking for me in the beginning. But somehow my head got around it and invented ""lore""-explanations for it. It's still not cool, but, well, I'll live with it.

4. NPCs are mostly just there. - Most of them don’t talk and when they do, there’s nothing to it. Sometimes they stand on top of each other or in a wall. Side-quests are very rare and very basic. To the point where I made dialogue up myself. Hey, I’m lonely sometimes, ok!? Point is - don’t expect an rpg. The players are the only really acting entities in this universe.

5. No faction interactions. Like NPCs, the factions don’t do much. Yeah, they’ll attack you if you got on their nerves, but they will not engage with each other (with very limited exceptions). There is no politics in this game.

6. Stations and ships are only for players. You can produce things to sell. But you have to do it manually. This is not an X-type of game. No NPC will visit your station or ship. Your ships can not be automated or piloted by the computer. Go play X4 already if you want that. It’s also good.

7. Ships are blocky. Because they consist of blocks. BUT there are people out there with very much creativity and seemingly no other hobby that they have made absolutely insane models for the workshop that you can build in the game. They look good. Really. Just look. And If you don’t like any, you can modify them or build your own very easily. I love modifying ships. It’s like playing with bricks, but in a very adult way. I think.

8. No story and quests. Ok, that’s a lie. There are some, more even in the aforementioned mods. And these modders are great, great people. But there is still a long way to go to make NPCs more lively. Do it on your own. Make quests for yourself and friends. Some of my games were more like pnp-sessions where I prepared some scenarios for my not-quite-so-hyped friends.

9. Bugs and glitches. There are quite a lot. Some of them have been there a long time without end in sight. Many people can live with the work-arounds, even more can’t. You have to find out for yourself. Teleport, for example, will sometimes just put you in space. Bones is right, use shuttles.

10. It’s not very smooth if you are in the vicinity of other player-ships. It lags. Often. Fights in these circumstances can be quite frustrating. Somehow I don’t mind as much as I feel I should.

There’s likely more that might fend many players off. Myself included. So why do I like this game? Honestly, it just clicked. Nothing more than that. There’s a lot of downtime and grind in this game (especially Reforged Eden). But I use this to chill. Learn repetitive stuff on the side (vocabulary, formulas, you name it). Hear a nice book. Same I would do in real life grind. But here I can do it while building or flying a fracking spacecraft. And when the action starts, it’s good action.

You see a star in the sky and can fly to it. Every star. That’s great! Will there be some unique stuff at this star? Most likely not. But maybe you will find something interesting or funny. Or help another player on the way. Or you just enjoy the scenery and the feeling of flying.
You can stand on your ship and just look at some planet or station. It can be quite beautiful.
Or you set out to some creepy exploration sectors with eerie music. Maybe something there waits for you. Maybe not.
It's just...great.

One small anecdote of one of my favourite moments of the game that made me fall in love.

So, this is on my first “run”. I’m about 30h in the game and got my first bigger ship that’s capable of jumping to another star. I’ve modified it to my liking, loaded up on fuel and ammo and am on my way. It’s not really big, but it should be able to defend itself from minor threats and flee others. I will be careful.
So I’m on my way. The first jumps are totally fine. Look, I’m exploring, yay! I have to run from some destroyers, but that’s fine. Space is big. Coming out of the sixth jump, something hits me. Half of my ship is gone (litterally) and I spot a huge dreadnough in the distance that just used me for target practice. But with all power gone, it loses interest and flies away. I think I’m dead. Not the worst in this game, you “just” have to build a new ship. But instead of killing myself, I will try to escape. The ship’s engines and generators are gone. As is the main cargo bay. So I summon my inner engineer, pull out the calculator and dismantle most of what’s still there. With that and much care and sweat, I manage to restore my smaller shuttle to a working condition and escape to a planet where I find a teleporter that gets me home.
About 100 hours later, I come back with a bigger ship, punch the dreadnought in the face and rescue what’s left of my first ship. It doesn’t matter at this point. But it feels good.",1688323516,1688324228,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Empyrion is a wonderfull Game.

I know, its one of the Horsemen of early access Hell. Open World Survival Craft, but you know what? It did it right. Sure, its Janky sometimes, the Animations arent top notch and you clearly see how its an Unity  game and yet here I am and say: ""man, this game is pretty decent.""

In Empyrion you Start out on a single Planet, crashing with your Escape Pod into the ground having the bare minimum for you to start. You run around, kill some local animals and start figuring out the game works. Shortly after you find yourself in a Base, that you´ve build in Minecraft style. Having a Powersource like Solar Panels, some ugly concrete/wood Cubicle that you call Home/Base and you start to get the hang of it. You refine recources, start exploring and eventually even have a Small Vessel that looks like its made by a 3 year old from lego, but it Works. It flys, has storage, some weapons and all that and then the game really shines in my Oppinion. You can build stuff that works very well and how you like it. No super complicated Mechanics like in Space Engineers for example. Just place some blocks and see the magic happen. Before you know it, you got a Space Station, a Fleet of various Vessels in different Sizes and Classes and the stars are yours for the Taking. You travel to different systems, explore the Planets, moons, asteroid Fields, find the various Factions and do your Thing.

I´ve been Playing this game since it Started in Early Access. Its come a long way. Every Major update I come back with some friends and we have roughly 100 hours Fun of Playtime with it.

Game even has some cool Story Missions and stuff if you dont have friends to play with for Singleplayer, but honestly, the game Shines in my Oppinion if you´re with Friends playing. Its a cool Gaming Moment, when you Blast some big ´ol Hole in some space station and you and your friends start boarding it and ripping it appart from the Inside. Or some Enemy Base has shot down your Friend and you have to stage a Rescue to get him and his stuff back.

I´ve had great Fun so far with this game, basicly encountered very little bugs, more jank rather and the Performance is ok.

So if you´re into space stuff, enjoy creating and got 10 bucks. Grab it, Rent a Server for you and your friends for another buck or two and have simply fun with it.

Also, if your fed up with the basic game, there is a huge rework Mod called ""Eden Reforged"" that drasticly changed the game so you´re basicly having a completly new experience. Game gets frequently Updated with new mechanics and so on. You can clearly tell this is someones Lovechild.

Thanks for Reading and have fun Exploring. :)",1688227334,1688227334,True,26,2,0.697593510150909424,0,True,False,False

The building in SE is more complex (mostly because you have the conveyers mechanics that simply don't exist in EGS), but that's about the only thing SE comes ahead. Everything else, Empyrion is better. 
In Empyrion you also have food, farming and recipes.  And most important, it actually has gameplay. There's a universe, made out of systems and planets. There are things to do, missions, exploration, abandoned structures, wild life, enemy NPC's. All things that Space Engineers doesn't have and doesn't seem interested in ever having. 
So yeah, while I would like to have the building system of Space Engineers  in Empyrion, with all it's conveyors, at the end of the day Empyrion is the better game.

There's a lot of potential here. A lot of good mechanics put together into a package that certainly *sounds* appealing. And, you can have fun with it. For a time. But this is a deeply flawed game in many ways, and the deeper you get into it, the more apparent those flaws become. 

The tutorial is a mess that just sort of throws information at you, asking you to then sift through relatively sparse documentation for better context. The interface for all of this isn't the absolute worst. but the menus in general seem needlessly complex. The core gather mechanics are okay, but certainly don't stand out. 

Where we get into real problems though is with the quests and combat, and with the game stability. Don't expect a bug free experience playing this game. Quests and even factions will break. Vehicles will do strange things. Clipping will become an issue. Become familiar with the command console, because you will absolutely need to use console commands to fix something at some point. If the bugs don't get ya, tho, the combat will. The combat is pretty bad. None of the guns are satisfying to use, and none of them feel particularly impactful. The enemies range between laughable pushovers to absolute fiends, but never in a good way. The AI is absolutely terrible, and NPCs regularly walk into walls and have just weird interactions with the level geometry. They are also completely stupid, generally being unable to do anything other than run into shooting distance and opening fire. They do *tons* of damage, often killing you in one hit. Consequently, the only real way to fight is to hit the enemy from an angle where they can't hit you. It's really just set up to encourage cheesing as much as possible. Win or lose, it really doesn't feel fair either way. If I win, it's because I'm usually just exploiting the poor AI, but if I lose, it's because the situation isn't really winnable, because the enemy has aimbot and can one-shot or two-shot you. There's even one part of the main quest that I am utterly convinced cannot be completed without access to godmode, because it has you running head first into a room of robot turrets with no cover and no other routes of ingress. 

The vehicle flight and combat is really weird too. This game should take some serious notes from X4 regarding space combat and space vehicle controls. Ultimately, the guns on your vehicles suffer the same problems as the ones in your hands. They just don't feel great, nor do they even feel powerful. Hover vehicles are basically useless. Small vehicles, which are your main space vehicle, can end up being very fidgety to control, especiallly if you fly them close to the ground. 

Aside from all that, there's other minor gripes, like the fact that the save system is deeply counter-intuitive, the audio tends to be choppy and unbalanced, and performance is generally not great. Also, the game kind of robs you of any sense of scale, as all the planets, even the big ones, just end up feeling like toy size versions. (They also really are not spheres at all once you're on them. Just square maps, that then load you into the space map at a certain altitude, replacing the land below with a spherical planet.Not a game breaker, but it sure don't help, particularly in world where Dyson Sphere Program exists.) This does not change once you get into space, which feels really really small. It's hard to take a space game seriously when planets and moons and satellites and stuff are only a few kilometres away. 

There are good things, too. The building is kinda fun, and the resource gathering is all right. In particular, salvaging wreckage is pretty satisfying. The story seems serviceable, but it isn't delivered in the best way considering how bugged the main quest is. 

All in all, I can't recommend this game, but I could be persuaded to change my mind with maybe another year or two of active development, There's a solid base to build from here, but this game just shouldn't be a full release. This is a game that should honestly be on early access.for at least another year. There's too many bugs to iron out, too many poor design choices, and too much polish that needs to be done.

Pros:
- Several planet types to visit.
- Different scenarios to try
- Build any kind of spaceship you want.
- Still being worked on.

Cons
- Survival aspects are pretty rudimentary. All you need are food and water, which are easy enough to come by.
- Ground combat is unfulfilling, as enemies have janky animation and are a step from brain-dead.
- Spaceships take a ton of resources, which usually means finding an enemy base, taking out the bad guys, then disassembling it block by block. Not really fun.
- More bugs than a cheap motel.
- Not a lot of purpose. Once you get the resources to explore other planets, there's not really a reason to do it.

I finally put more hours into it.

This is a tech demo. The planets are tiny, transition from land to space is done awkwardly, most of the interesting tech is pointlessly locked behind completely arbitrary ""Levels"" (which you can raise by picking flowers, of all things) and point costs, enemy models are ugly and taken from unity asset store. 

There are no wheeled vehicles, you cannot move inside a ship while it is moving, and movement is ""floaty"". Apparently you're supposed to spend the rest of your life hunting for more fuel if you want to power anything, there are no solar and electric ships. However, somehow you're able to go to space using biofuel. 

Some ship parts are arbitrarily locked out and are made unavailable. For example, no lower tier mining attachment on small vessels (which can fly into space), capital ship weapons don't work in atmosphere, because reasons and so on. Point system is annoying, you'll be unlocking same part for different vehicle sizes again and again and again, which is not a whole lot of fun.

Frankly, space engineers is much more polished in comparison. 

I kinda wonder why to this date no ship building game got it right. It wouldn't be hard to make a ""ship design station"" where the player could design stuff in nearly-creative mode, and then print them in one go in some sort of ""wharf"", ""vehicle builder"", ""ship printer"" and so on. 

---

(review 2020) Gave the game another try after galactic update.  Now I can no longer refund it.

And.... 

Some of the things I didn't like the last time were addressed. You can now use inventory without dragging, it is possible to look around on bike, etc. That was surprising, and it is a positive. However.

The game is awful. It looks horrible, resembles mish-mash of unity asset store assets, visuals are horrendeously bad, flight model is missing any semblance of mass or inertia. I had npcs interacting with me through the walls, saw creatures pretty much doing the skyrim horse thing, it is grindy, and also it features some of the worst storywriting I encountered in a game.

Why is this even popular? Even planet explorers, despite all their flaws were better than this. 

In greater detail.
[list]
[*]Awful audio effects. That includes monster roars, and any voice effects made by your character upon receiving damage. Character voice is quite horrible.
[*]Visuals are bad. The game looks nothing like its promo art, and while you might run into some nice sunrise in the wilderness, if you bump into abandoned structures, then some of them look like they were taken straight from 1999. Mishmash of blurry incomprehensible visuals. Animation is also quite poor.
[*]Flight model is bad. You don't have wheeled vehicles here, but the first one is ground hugging hovercraft, and this thing has twitchy movement but slow turns. Feels like it doesn't have any mass, and turns are artificially slowed down.
[*]Enemies are incredibly dumb.
[*]First enemies can be quite durable against beginner weapon, and are able to stunlock you.
[*]The story writing in the main mission is an abomination. I've not seen this sort of poor writing for a very long time, it mostly feels very childish, and cannot support any sort of suspension of disbelief. 
[*]Can't walk through a vehicle while it is flying, and can't depart it while it is flying. Space engineers could do this. 
[*]Occasional wrecks you encounter in the story mission do not look like they were funcitonal ships once. Feel like very artificial ""levels"", with no room for people to move through, no places to live in and so on.
[*]Main character model looks horrendeously bad. Especially if you chose female avatar.
[*]Base building is awkward. Basically you first craft blocks in a constructor, then carry them to destination and build them.
[/list]

I'm not sure if I'll try to get past the solo mission nonsense I've run into, but so far it looks like a complete trainwreck.

Not recommended for purchase. Try X4, No Man's Sky, maybe Elite Dangerous.

Original review. (before galactic update)

I requested a refund.

After a brief introduction in the tutorial, following issues became obvious.
[list]
[*][strike]Bike handling is awful. (can't rotate the camera and you're glued to landscape)[/strike]
[*][strike]Obvious UI oversights. For example, to move items between inventories you have to drag and drop them with mouse. All other games allow quick movement with clicking.[/strike]
[*]Player model looks quite ... dated. There are few preset faces, but they're made by adjusting bone sizes and there are awful ones. Props to them for plugging in UMA system, but, uh, unity asset store had prettier models for UMA which could be used.
[*]Indoors don't look that great. At the end of the tutorial I wandered into abandoned complex and at night it is just flat colored lighting everywhere. Maybe enabling SSR would improve it, but even space engineers looks better than this.
[*]Maps feel small.
[*]Maps feel samey and rather featureless. It feels like you're driving along a heightmap with some monsters scattered about as dots. That's pretty much what happens.
[/list]

The game was in development for a long time, and this should've been fixed by now.

Positives:
[list]
[*]It is one of the few games where developers figured out that crafting station should craft components automatically. Good job with that.

On paper, it sounds like my dream game: a mix of FPS, ship building, survival, space combat, exploration, and dungeon crawling in a huge universe. However, the gameplay itself is incredibly janky and frustrating.

The on foot / FPS gameplay is very stiff and non-responsive, like an FPS from like 2002. None of the guns feel good to shoot, and combat is more about micromanaging your ammo count and healing items than it is about skill.

NPC AI is one of the worst parts of this game. When you attack hostile buildings, it's an exercise in frustration. Cheesing the game is standard operating procedure, as that is the only way to clear areas. Alien soldiers will spawn into their bases on literal warp pad blocks when you enter the room, then immediately shoot you. They deal huge amounts of damage, often one-shotting you, which I believe is a poor design choice to compensate for their awful AI. They will sometimes slowly walk through hallways, but for the most part they stand idly around, and the preferred way of killing enemies is to find an angle where they can't see you, but you can shoot them. If shot, they'll just stand there until you kill them.
You can stand directly above or beneath enemies, and they won't shoot up or down. They are just bullet sponges which require you to fire from weird angles in order to clear them out, slowly clearing a base room by room.

Ship building is alright, but the controls feel awful. Hover vehicles are borderline unusable on any planets with foliage, as your vehicle will constantly get stuck on trees and flip over. Flying larger ships in space just feels super floaty and weird, with a low travel speed and generally  unresponsive controls, making space combat frustrating too. Once you finally defeat a sizable alien ship (after wasting thousands of rounds of ammo), enjoy the physics glitches as the defeated wreckage becomes non-interactable and then de-spawns before you can loot it. Also, it is completely impossible to commandeer enemy ships. You can't fly them at all. There are also no small NPC / enemy ships in the game, so fighter-to-fighter combat isn't a thing in single player.

The graphics are generally not good, with very weird lighting that frequently makes it hard to see what is going on, and plenty of ugly assets and weirdly gaseous-looking planet LODs. Performance is bad in many situations. Where comparable games (Space Engineers, Star Citizen, No Man's Sky) run just fine for me, performance is consistently choppy in Empyrion. It feels like a really poorly optimized game.

There are also many little annoyances. The sound design is plain bad, with many annoying sounds constantly playing. 

Like I said, I want to like this game. I wish I hadn't spent 300+ hours trying to. 
If the developers could improve the issues described in this review, this would honestly be a really good game - but there are too many frankly infuriating gameplay issues currently.",1687145602,1687145602,False,120,6,0.813825666904449463,0,True,False,False

But we quit because in the development state back then there was nothing more to do. Now it's 2023. 7(!) years of development later. Oh, now there's a story, now there are NPCs. Now there is content. I thought I give a new try, but I just must ask: Have you went completely insane?? Yes, the Lego aspect is still pretty funny, but I played that to death 7(!) years ago. And what is new is so UTTERLY screwed up beyond all believes, I thought I'm on a bad trip.
So, to come to the core, do NOT play the story AT ALL. Do NOT go into ANY combat with NPCs AT ALL! Why? 
Because every flipping enemy, even the smallest one, can kill you with 2-3 hits... while you are wearing the heaviest available armor, WITH armor boosters. And since the game relies on a spawner mechanic, popping up the enemies right behind your back regularly (at least in POIs) you have NO chance on reacting fast enough before you get killed. This leads to you running COMPLETELY unequipped back to your dropped stuff in the hopes that same enemy doesn't ONE-SHOT you again before you pick up your stuff and get in at least maybe two or three hits (of which they soak up so much, from EPIC weapons by the way, the term ""bullet sponge"" gets a completely new meaning) before you die again. Rinse and repeat for about 30 minutes and MAYBE you made progress of ridicoulus amounts. Great. I've lost so much time the last week I spent on this game that I feel just betrayed.
Specifically, pointed towards the Devs, the story line on Sienna is outrageous... getting teleported to a FLYING POI, which you can't reach anymore after the first turret INSTANTLY killed you right after arrival, having your vehicle and reserve equipment parked MILES away... you gotta be flipping kidding me... lost all my epic equipment and several dozens hours of gameplay. 
And the most flipped up thing EVER: THE GAME OVERWRITES MY MANUAL SAVES!!! NO GOING BACK FROM THIS HELLHOLE!!! ARE YOU NUTS?! Flip you very much.
So what's left of the game? The building stuff. Which is fun. For about 10 hours when you realize to progess any further you MUST get into hostile territory to get the materials for advanced production. m|n/
I don't know how other players do this, and honestly, I don't care. This clearly didn't went through any playtesting, because such BS would have been found right away. Oh, and the possibility to skip quest and sub-tasks? Nice feature. But, how about CODING and BALANCING this sh*t right in the first place so you don't have to this when the game bugs out or screws you again?!
I don't even want to open the can of worms that is bugs, after a decade of development...
So, overall... No. Just no. It's 2023, and these issues are 80s era. Stay away, there are similar games out there much more worth even the, admittently, decent price.
P.S. I changed my mind. I WILL open the can of worms that is bugs.
- How can it be, that in game, that is in development for 9(!) frigging years, and which is sold als RELEASE there are bugs that crash my entire game AND lock up my PC??? I am afraid of leaving any Planet, a flipping BASIC functionality of the game, because it crashes 1 out of 10 times
- How can it be, that on every other build I do I get stuck in a just placed block and need to kill myself to get unstuck. Another flipping BASIC functionality of the flipping game!
- How can it be, that the NPCs I NEED to talk to progress in the game all of the sudden just deny talking to me? ANOTHER FREAKING BASIC FUNCTION OF THE F**ING GAME!!!

It is probably the best open world build everything game out there.  The base and ship building is still solid, the advancement of crafting and materials seems much better balanced.  The worlds have expanded and they no longer feel barren.  There are multiple factions that you can cultivate rep with.  Unfortunately the two weaknesses I came across are the rep quests are still pretty janky, sometimes they work, other times they don't.  The other issue is the difficulty curve.  Even on easy if you accidentally walk in LOS of an enemy base turret (happened to me 3x at the pirate brewery mission base, the pirate  wrecked ship on the desert starter planet, and the radio tower mission), you get evaporated.  There is also no slew rate for the cannon turrets, and they never miss a shot, which means you can't evade unless you can get behind cover.  Honestly, they should completely disable enemy turrets from targeting the player directly, there are already different turrets for that purpose that have more reasonably scaled damage.  Another minor complaint is that the large and advanced constructor both have identical models (they used to be different).

Update 3: (July 3, 2019)  I just checked back, tried to start up the game, and every save I try to load crashes.  Steam says I need to re-install the game entirely, apparently it is too out of date?  It is clear if you look down my review updates that this game was playable and fun 3 years ago.  What value has Eleon added since then?  None as far as I can see.  They have bricked save files with hundreds of hours of play, ruined schematics for every custom ship I ever made, they add as many bugs as they fix, they reskin and make meaningless changes with no real progress towards a final product.  Sadly I have come to the realization that they don't have the self discipline or programming talent and are unwilling to hire the talent and impose the discipline to actually fix the bugs, release the game, and move on.  At least in part I blame Steam, who are like a car dealer selling a car frame with an engine on wheels with the promise the rest will be delivered in a reasonable time.  Well it has been about 4 years with no real progress and no end in sight.  

Update 2:  (June 24, 2018)  So I took a break from Empyrion and got back on today to see how the game is shaping up.  It is still early access Beta after 3(?) years of development from what was a fun, playable game???  The developer has totally revamped the inventory icons (Why?  the old ones were fine, this was just a waste of time and money), they have updated many of the device models (again, why, the old ones were fine) and they have made it an an absolutely miserable grind to get your first small space ship.  

Most importantly, they have completely broken my saves with hundreds of hours of play time, as well as most of my blueprints.  The developer is clearly cluless on WTF they are doing.  They will probably continue to flop around wasting resources until they go bankrupt and this game that had great potential will probably never make it out of early access.  If the devs had any clue they would finalize the few remaining mechanics, dial in the combat and NPC AI and release the game and then start working on expansion packs to add in new features and what not while not breaking the core game.  Unfortunately they seem to lack vision and discipline... I can't recommend a game where the developer doesn't respect the people shelling out cash to play and help them fund the completion of their game enough to be disciplined with their time and resources and focus on generating a finished product in a timely fashion.  

Update 1: (June 13, 2017)  Well, I logged in to play a bit, I was on my CV and now there is no power and my GD jetpack appears to be not working, so I cant move. I died and dropped my backpack and every time I respawn, I just die again because I can't move to power my ship... This is on version 6.0.1. Not your finest moment guys. I guess this is why I stopped buying or playing early access games... :steamsad:


Original review: (October 2016)
Early access review: The single player game is fun, has a lot of versatility.  The difficulty curve is somewhat broken;  I would like to see the ability to scale enemy HP up vs scale enemy damage up.  Enemies are 2D sprites instead of 3D models.  Bugs in alpha include ships that have landed being popped up into the air/popping wheelies, for large capital vessels this means you cant enter them sometimes.  Landed ships also jitter even after touch down and power down, sliding you around inside like a marble in a jar.  I have also had ships and other placed items despawn completely out of the blue.  

Unfortunately cheating/exploiting in online servers seems rampant.  There appears to be some kind of cheat/exploit to DC a player as they enter orbit/enter planet/leave warp, which leaves them defenseless on servers who have disabled offline protection.  My recommendation is to wait until the developers finish the game, unless you like playing with yourself, because you really need god mode to deal with some of the bugs in current builds.",1481408761,1686349339,True,0,0,0.48151785135269165,0,True,False,True

Almost 700 hours took place back in 2016.  I loved the game, but I found it buggy back then.  I kept opening saved games to find them corrupted and unplayable.  Seven years later with almost 100 hours of playing in 2023, I'm having the same problems.  I just lost my three last saved games.  Each time I opened a game I started falling through the planet.  I lost hours of gameplay, and if the last two games are also corrupted, then I will have to start all over again and lose almost 100 hours of work.  While playing the game, I have to save about every 20 minutes, so that if the game glitches, I don't lost too much.  This is unacceptable.  This game has so much new content and I like most of the changes made in the last seven years, but it's all for naught if I keep losing saved games.

Shortly: Empyrion - Galactic Survival is space crafting open world game that you can play on your own or on a server with some friends. You start with some tools to help you get started and the tutorial is good and simple. Some things can be a bit difficult at first but the community of this game is so friendly and helpful. You can craft your own vessels from scratch or just build a pre-built ship from the Steam Workshop. You can decide that if you want to play PvP or PvE and I personally like both (PvP of course only available on a server with other human players).

I recommend even trying out and if you still after reading this comment don't know that if you want to buy this then no worries because there are lots more positive comments about this game.

So once again I've returned to the time-sink that is Empyrion.  It seems every time I return to this game it's both out of nostalgia, and because other friends are also returning to it and need a server (which I host).  At any rate, I'm glad to say that the realm of Empyrion keeps improving every time I visit!

I've been very used to Empryion having a fairly static universe, and I use the term universe very loosely since there really wasn't a massive galaxy to explore...  Fast forward to 2020 and guess what?  Not only is there a massive galaxy that's randomly generated, you can also see the galaxy from everywhere.  Standing on a planet?  See another planet in the night sky?  Guess what?  You can go there!  See some stars in the distance?  Guess what?  You can go there!  My jaw dropped when I switched to the galaxy view and actually saw there were, quite literally, thousands (if not more) of solar systems I could visit.  Seriously, it's an ACTUAL GALAXY!  In addition, you can even see faction borders of the NPC's.   Think Star Trek with the Romulan Empire, Klingons, etc. and how everyone had their own borders.  Yes, it's a true galactic civilization going on.

There have also been quite a few building improvements.  Build yourself a ""concrete block"", hold it in your hand, and right click.   Boom!  3 pages of various shapes and sizes for you to morph that concrete block into before placing it.  This increases your ability to customize your ships and buildings by quite an extensive amount.  Get the exact look you're looking for.  In addition, most other objects also have their own visual versions.  Cargo boxes?  Something like a dozen visual options.  Windows?  Yep, lots of options.  Fridges?  There are a half dozen different looks.  The list goes on.

If I had to pick one gripe that exists in the current incarnation of Empyrion, it would be the lack-luster power you get from Solar.  In direct sunlight, running 2 panels, I was hard pressed to keep one constructor and a single fridge running.  They would constantly pulse on and off, and I didn't quite think that was realistic for the size of solar panel I was using (large x2).

Another small gripe I found was, while on a server, when you brought a capital vessel into a planet's orbit and you had a ship docked inside (hover or small fighter) it would regularly fall through the capital vessel.  I think it's because the capital vessel and the small ship load in at different speeds.  Not a big deal, you can fly down and pick up the small vessel that fell out of your capital ship.  You do need to be aware that this can happen though.

Verdict?  This is still one of the best survival games that includes both planet and space flight.  Other games, like Space Engineers, do a pretty bad job trying to compete with Empyrion, the top dog in this genre.  If you're on the fence, get it.  If you're even a little interested, get it.  If you have friends and co-op all the time... This is a must have.


------------------------------------------------------------------


Original Review;

When I first picked up Empyrion : Galactic Survival I have to admit that I wasn’t impressed.  I had been playing another very similar title for quite some time and found Empyrion to be fairly inferior when it came to the game experience as a whole.  Recently returning to Empyrion I found many changes.  Let’s just say, my first day returning to this game I put 12 hours into it.

Empyrion : Galactic Survival is one of those games that you’ll either love or hate.  It’s a game based heavily on survival where you absolutely can’t sit idle.  You can’t just put up a few walls, toss on a roof, and consider yourself safe.  If you don’t keep up with your tasks (like gathering food/oxygen) you’ll quickly find yourself dying.  In addition, resources are fairly limited so you have to continuously push yourself to explore further and further away from your comfort zone (aka. Your base).

Crafting in Empyrion is a fairly simple task, with most machines requiring you to first craft components for those machines.  Even some components require components.  While some may find this a tedious task to perform, I rather enjoied it as it gave me something to constantly be doing.   You can’t just “click” and have yourself a cockpit (for example), you actually have to build the parts for it before it can be assembled.  I enjoyed this in the other title I mentioned earlier, and I like that Empyrion has adopted this crafting style.  There is a bit of a balance problem in crafting, however, and I hope that the developers solve it in the future.  While crafting items doesn't really have this problem, crafting food seems to be a little problematic.  Take a ""sandwitch"", for example.  In order to make a sandwitch you need to use a salami, a bread, and a tomato.  Seperately, in total these three items contain values of 195 food, 30 health, and 30 stamina.  Together, as a sandwitch, the values are 160 food, 10 health, and 25 stamina.  Thus you would be an idiot to craft a sandwitch as you are loosing a lot of food value in a game where food is always a struggle.  In crafting you would expect that a crafted item would have an equal, if not a higher, value than what you are putting into it.  This is one small way in which crafting recipes are currently ""broken"" in empyrion, but hopefully will be fixed.

In returning to the game I also found myself dealing with a new leveling system as well.  Each time you gain a level you unlock some basic building block recipes and get points to unlock more complex crafting recipes.  You have to spend your points wisely or you may find yourself without the recipes you need, when you want them.  In addition, all recipes have a level requirement so you can’t simply unlock missile launchers (for example) at level 2 and blow everything up.  The mix of level locks, plus point unlocks, makes leveling a fairly exciting experience.  That being, every time you level you basically go “Sweet!  Now I can unlock that ____ I’ve been wanting to make!”

Mobs in Empyrion come in a couple different varieties.  You first have your basic non-aggressive indigenous creatures that will simply go about their business without a care in the world (until you shoot at them).  Next you have indigenous creatures that are hostile towards you and will attack you if you get too close.  It’s fairly difficult to tell the hostile mobs apart from the non-hostile mobs without actually risking being attacked, as they all look pretty mean, but once you gain the knowledge it makes the world a lot easier to navigate.  The third variety comes in the form of NPC structures that have turrets and enemy units, as well as drones that will hunt you down.  These drones can be fairly useful when lured away from their bases as, if you’re powerful enough to take them on, they always drop components you can use to craft equipment and machinery.

Finally we come down to the core of the game.  Does the game look good and sound good?  Well…  Yes, it does.  It’s not going to be winning any awards for realism and immersion, but when it’s stacked up beside other games in this genre it actually surpasses most of them.  Each creature has unique sounds, which I actually find very fitting to them and enjoy.  Music is well placed and fits the theme.  Distant planets and moons rise and set in the sky.  It’s actually very well polished for still being in Pre-Alpha.

So what’s my verdict?  Well, as I said, people will either love this game or hate it.  Personally I love it and I’d recommend it to anyone who likes games from the survival crafting genre.  That said, you'll just have to make up your own mind.

there are way too many options and things to build.

The land, on the first planet, is vast and empty for how small it is. You can, very soon, I might add, explore another planet. That might be ill-advised though. The temperature will crush you in a few minutes.

Building is passable, but doesn't really offer anything new. Combat is atrocious, especially on foot gunplay. Sound design is poor, apart from music which I'd generously call ""unobtrusive"". Animations range from basic to outright bad. The UI is another ranges from basic to bad affair, and the tutorial made me feel like I was having a stroke reading the dialogue (that is to say, until the tutorial broke because a step bugged out).

Planets actually look decent, but almost all other visuals in the game are poor, from individual block textures to the hilariously bad NPC models that look like they got ripped out of the original Half Life / Deus Ex or some other more generic sci fi shooter of that time; half of the blocks/items of the game look like either placeholder assets or something donated by a modder with no professional experience.

As is usually the case, the voxel terrain adds very little to the game.

Bugs abound, from mission objectives breaking, to items randomly disappearing, blocks ending up in weird places not matching the preview while building, the player character dying out of nowhere, game physics being game physics and the voxel terrain misbehaving.

The game isn't completely without merits -- it has some actually really solid ideas (the player drone and remote connectivity in particular) and implements several systems done by many games reasonably well (crafting for example, the automatic component crafting gives a good balance between complexity and convenience) but all in all, a game that has spent something like 8 years in development and been officially released for more than 2 years has no business being this bad in so many ways.

Made a Survival Constructor, filled it with stuff, made a small base.  Needed to move the Survival Constructor, so I picked it up.  My mistake because everything I had inside it is now GONE, permanently destroyed.  Great job guys, 10/10 would hire development house again.

No matter, because this game is still so broken, I just walked over to a nearby ruin and put a core on it, salvaged it, and now I have so much advanced material that I've basically skipped over almost all the survival progress in the game.

Physics are still full of inexplicable failures, movement is still like swimming in molasses, motorcycle is still useless, and the graphics are still generally awful.  My honest feeling is the devs should abandon this project because it is hopelessly behind the times now.

(12/25/2020 Update:  I wouldn't recommend either this or Space Engineers now.  Both have fallen so far behind the times.  Empyrion's updates have only been for the worse; the entire tech and combat systems are totally broken, frustrating, and exploitable.  The devs don't seem to have any vision anymore, they just tally up user opinions and then make changes according to those polls.  Problem is, that makes a haphazard experience that fights and punishes you instead of rewarding.)

(6/6/2017 Update:  I honestly would recommend Empyrion now over Space Engineers.  SE is very polished in general and I had a blast playing it when it was the only game in town, but unfortunately it's perpetually frustrating to due to apparently very bad QA practices by the developer.  Running a reliable multiplayer server in SE has not been possible in about an entire year, and at this point I just don't have faith in the project.  I think newer games and better planetary tech coming around the corner have made it obsolete.)

I see a lot of people who compare this to Space Engineers.  As someone with 400+ hours in SE and now 40+ hours in Empyrion, I can easily say this:  they are both great additions to your library, if you like what they offer.

Space Engineers is prettier, more realistic, less forgiving, and has more options for automation.  The physics are generally quite good but multiplayer code is still spotty (updates are in the works).  If you want to feel alone in space in slightly futuristic times, and have the freedom to make whatever crazy thing you want, this is the game for you.

Empyrion has more variety, more accessible interface, cleaner controls, and is more linear in goals and progression.  It has many different planets, flora, fauna, food, equipment, weapons, etc. and puts SE far behind in this aspect.  But, it is less sandbox and more about acheiving each new step up in technology and reach throughout the solar system, so it's more like a ""typical"" game with a beginning and an end.  There is even a ""leveling"" system, more like an RPG.  So if you want a bit of that and space survival put together, and don't mind it being less realistic and less polished, but easier to dive into and more colorful, this is the game for you.

I really enjoy both for different reasons.  They both seem to have regular updates and are made by Indie houses doing great jobs.  I definitely recommend Empyrion if it looks at all appealing to you.",1482016412,1683222007,False,1,0,0,3,True,False,False

UPDATE: I haven't played this game since AUG of 2022. Not because there's anything wrong with the game, quite the opposite. The devs keep updating so much that I find that I have to remake a new save game because the previous one is incompatible with the current version. Constantly making new worlds because the devs keep pumping out updates is NOT a bad thing at all. Well, the making new worlds is annoying, but the reason behind it gives me much hope that development will continue on this great and ambitious game. I am curious to see how Bethesdas new game Starfield will compare.

I'll say this, what this game has that's better than Space Engineers doesn't out weigh what makes it terrible.  Space Engineers never figured out water to my knowledge they also only had like one type of Alien in there entire game, there wasn't NPCs or nothing like that just AI ships flying around destroying you.

This game offers water physics be it very annoying and slowing when holding a tool.
This game  has NPCs
This game has factions
This Game has a lot of good things that make it a bit better than SE.

What this game does though is terrible towards the player.
Reputation system is utter crap, you could be the highest rep and one stray bullet puts you to  neutral or unfriendly. So you drop from 30,000 to 12,000 or 11,000 Terrible idea should of been refined before the release in 2020. Reputation is something that's been around for 10 years before this games release in 2020, they could of learned from that.

Spawning mechanics are terrible as well, stuff still glitches into the ground when killed, things people complained about in 2018 still isn't fixed in 2023 and wasn't fixed before the 2020 release.

I have no uninstalled this game and fully regret bothering to try it, just cuz of a friend's recommendation.

I highly recommend anyone who was suggested this game, ignore those suggestions and just  go play Space Engineers or No Mans Sky.

I'm not spending my time to send an email about all the issues, when Feedback can be built into the game, and bug report systems can be built into the game.  Many other games before this learned how to do that, these guys could of done the same.

Very deadly enemies that can inflict you with lethal status effects can just spawn right on top of you. The ones that don't spawn on top of you make noises, but you can't actually tell where they are coming from. It seems to be the same volume regardless of distance or obstacles, and in all directions. There is no radar to tell where enemies are either so every point of interest you go to, you will have to be permanently paranoid of an enemy just popping into existence and killing you. They also like to stand directly below you when you are above them, or they get bugged on the elevators (until they don't and are on top of you in 0.3 seconds), and the game won't let you aim directly down and makes you slip off edges easily, which just makes all of this a pain in the ass. It's like the developers purposefully designed this to just to make the player suffer. It makes me question if they even played their own game.

The missions are either horribly designed or bugged. I can't tell if I've finish some of them or not, or if I did, if I was suppose to receive some sort of notification that it happened.

Available on Steam, Empyrion offers an immersive experience that challenges players to survive and thrive in a vast and captivating universe.

Empyrion: Galactic Survival excels in its realistic portrayal of engineering and scientific principles. The game provides a rich environment for budding engineers and scientists to test their skills and apply their knowledge. From designing and constructing complex structures to mastering advanced machinery, the gameplay revolves around the principles of physics, mechanics, and resource management. This aspect of the game sets it apart and makes it an excellent educational tool for aspiring engineers.

The game's attention to detail is awe-inspiring. The meticulously designed planets, diverse biomes, and stunning celestial objects create a visually stunning and believable universe. The immersive atmosphere draws players into a world filled with endless possibilities, where they can explore unknown territories, mine resources, and encounter unique challenges.

Empyrion: Galactic Survival shines when it comes to its building and crafting mechanics. With an extensive range of construction components, players can let their creativity run wild and build impressive bases, vehicles, and even starships. The intuitive building system empowers players to experiment, innovate, and see their engineering marvels come to life. The satisfaction derived from constructing intricate structures and witnessing them function seamlessly is unparalleled.

The game's progression system is well-balanced and rewarding. As players explore, gather resources, and undertake missions, they unlock new technologies and blueprints that expand their engineering capabilities. This sense of progress and growth keeps players engaged and motivated to push the boundaries of their engineering prowess.

Moreover, Empyrion: Galactic Survival offers a multiplayer mode that encourages collaboration and cooperation among players. Teaming up with friends or joining online communities creates a dynamic social experience where engineers can share their knowledge, collaborate on ambitious projects, and embark on daring adventures together. The multiplayer aspect adds a layer of excitement and camaraderie that enhances the overall gameplay experience.

The developers of Empyrion: Galactic Survival have shown remarkable dedication and commitment to the game's community. Regular updates and patches, as well as an active engagement with players, demonstrate their passion for delivering a high-quality experience. The constant improvement and addition of new features ensure that the game remains fresh and relevant for both new and seasoned players.",1682655857,1682655857,True,2,0,0.504864037036895752,0,True,False,False

I bought this game very early on in its development. It was something like version 2, of the Early Access. The game is vastly improved since then, but what I once saw as being a diamond in the rough, I now discover to be nothing more than a dull lump of coal. 

I stopped playing about version 7-8, because, quite frankly, the game was simply tedious. A huge amount of the 550+ hours I had put into the game were simply engaged in mindless mining for resources, all so that I could get off planet and build some of the wonderful ships that are on the Steam Workshops. 

Recently, I noticed the game was out of early access. Great! Lets dive in for another go! :-) 

Bad mistake.

Not only is mining is still the backbone of the game, but they've made it worse. About version 4-5, some idiot decided that mining hover vehicles would be a great idea. Its wasn't: Hover vehicles spent most of their time, simply bouncing around the uneven underground terrain and desperately trying to reach minerals that they had sunk below. 

I was fairly vocal on the Dev's forums calling for a rework of this mechanic, or preferably, its entire removal. At the very least, they could have removed the stupidity of the forward facing drill bits and allowed the player to hose up the minerals, in a manner similar to the hand held mining devices. After a series of failed fixes, I simply gave up.

Mining vehicles weren't all bad. They could be used to get underneath enemy POIs in order to take them from below, using explosives to blow your way through the floor and they would reliably drill through a mountain range, which was good, because hover vehicles didn't like anything but flat.

Now, after some two years of further development, instead of making things better, they've royally screwed mining and turned it into a complete grind. Not only is it incredibly difficult to tell the difference between dirt and the minerals (something I don't previously recall being the case),  I have literally just abandoned my mining hover vehicle 64 metres under ground (which is as deep as the geography seems to go), because not only did it keep on getting stuck in the tunnels it had dug, but nothing I did could get it to resurface. After spending 45 minutes jigging the controls like a lunatic and actually getting out of the vehicle in order to manually try to free it. I just left it there, closed the game and deleted it from my hard drive. 

Some aspects of the game are amazing. There is an avid community of people who are designing amazing ships, so you don't have to. About three years ago, I built one that was probably a KM long. I kid you not. It was a masterpiece, put together by some guy on Steam, not the Developers themselves.

But in order to get to that point of the game, you have to put in literally dozens of hours of non-stop mining, in order to gather the necessary resources and it simply isn't worth the slog, and boredom this entails. 

Even if you do get to the point where you are building these wonderful ships, game development means that that many of the ones available through the Steam workshop won't as intended. At best, when you load it, it'll say that there are incorrect (AKA out of date) blocks an you simply won't be able to build it, but this isn't always the case. The first hover miner I built was my previous favourite, however, because of some game change, not only could I not get into the damned thing, but it didn't even have any drill bits attached.  So you could build the ship of your dreams, only to find that it is missing essential bits that make it go. 

After this experience, I deleted all of my workshop craft and only used the ones that come with the game, which is where I got stuck 60 metres under the ground.

Finally, while there are other problems, such as enemy AI, there also now appears to be an issue with rebinding keys. For some reason, the game insisted on binding jump and reload on the same key, so that every time I jumped, I reloaded which was a real bitch, because early on in the game, there are some items, that have ""bulk"" magazines that can be used for quite some time, but are hard, or impossible to replace at that stage. Keybinding bugs should not be a feature of games this far along in their development cycle.

I had hoped to see this game rise to glory, but it is a definite miss. No way should it have left early access in its current state. Sure, there is a story line, but what point is that, when the basic mechanics are still so bad?

I've kept my original review below, for historical purposes. 

/Uninstalled (yet again).

Outstanding!

This is an excellent game, especially if you are into the mining and construction business.

As it is still in Alpha, it isn't a particularly polished game, but the framework is definitely there for a terrific playing experience.

Quite stable too. I've played about 30 or so hours and have had only one crash. Died heaps and the save game feature is a bit weird, so I recommend that you copy your save file to another during play, so that you can retrieve games that have been written over by the game.

>> really not recommend to people who think first person view gameplay gonna be good it is not

im gonna leave the old review here

For an early access game this one is very enjoyable there is a lot to do in this game even better with friends!
really recommend this if you like survival game there are base building,vehicle building,adventure they got it
a very fine gather/builder game with enough amount of survival and combat.

Learning the game at the start can be somewhat confusing but once you get the hang of it, it good.",1578579379,1682308925,True,8,0,0.502779901027679443,0,True,False,False

This game is not a graphical masterpiece. There are moments where you step back and admire the scenes or images, such as your favorite ship in orbit or some hostile planetary terrain. But, in general you shouldn’t expect this game to compete on that level. Is it satisfactory and sufficient? Yes. Awesome? Not so often.
The game play loop is good. Every survival game has a level of grind and farming, literal and figurative. EGS mixes in a decent amount of deadly aliens and points of interest to raid for resources to keep things interesting. Once you get off world there is even more to do and the grind changes shape to keep it interesting.  You go from hunting rocks and ore deposits to mining asteroids and dodging alien patrol vessels.
While this game has first person shooter elements it is not the games strong point, but it works. There are no grenades, and there are more than enough places to want a good grenade. The weapons in the base game are decent and you can get epic weapons that make short work of most foes. Getting out of your league is very easy though, Some locations are next to impossible as a single player and have to be approached with a creative mindset. This will often mean a custom built tank or weapons emplacement, but I will talk more about that in a moment. Just be aware that the shooter aspect of this game is fun if you accept it for what it is.
The overall story of the game is good, but incomplete as of this writing and to my knowledge. I say to my knowledge because like all open world/universe games you can ignore it if you want. I have played through with the mindset that I was going to be a space pirate and found no difficulty. What there is of the story will keep you busy and is fun, but as I said it is incomplete.
The building of Capital Vessels (CV), Hover Craft (HV), Small Vessels (SV) and Bases is a strong point in this game. It is not nearly as complicated as other games but does take a bit of getting used to. Each craft type has their own difficulties and requirements, and bases have to obey structural integrity. The room for creativity is amazing and if you take the time to put effort into it you can build some incredible things. The workshop where the community has uploaded their blueprints is endless proof of that.
There are also several scenarios in the workshop that alter the main game in minor or drastic ways. The most popular of which is Reforged Eden. This particular scenario is the work of two brilliant maniacs who have decided that the game lacks enough weapons, parts, side quests, and pain. This scenario is unforgiving to solo players but has deep rewards. It is also proof of the thriving and creative community that is invested in this game. 
The devs are very active and there are regular updates. This is good in the sense that the bugs get fixed and new quality of life items added. It's a difficulty in that from time to time saved games get rendered unplayable and you have to start again. This can be avoided and managed but it still is a frustration.
I recommend this game to any one who wants the freedom to build and explore.",1553385741,1682283168,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

My advice, use only the pre-made bases/vehicles until you really get a hang of it. try to learn on how things are put together with walls, blocks before making your own. (and don't give up on it...); Lastly, dont attack any races/pirates, and watch what territory your in. I'm still trying to recover from building in the wrong territory.

Empyrion has come a long way in its development but still has room to grow, creativity is limited with this games focus on PvP and that the enemy faction is always stronger than you, what makes you different is the wit and the ability to use the environment as your weapon compared to the AI.

When I say that creativity is limited, I mean its limited, people have often claim that in PvP you can just build a box and strap a billion turrets on it, and win. Well that isn't the games fault, thats the fault of the people who set the rules on the PvP, so why limit the amount of guns, the type of guns, even what gun goes on what craft. Its been proven that you can mount guns on any ship in the game when you tweak the files that hold the constraints, but it takes a bit to get that setup and after every single bugfix, update, major patches, you will need to do it again, and again, and  again. It's annoying in that regard, and shocked its not in a more 'advance' menu when setting up a custom game mode.

Creativity is also limited by CPU and core constraints, you can only build a ship so big, and CPU limits the amount of modules otherwise you will be burdened by slow equipment or power draw, even both. One of these can be avoided thankfully, but ship size is hard-coded, and requires a bit of trickery with building a ship. So the idea of building a massive ship like a Titan, or the lot is limited. 

Small block ships are extremely limited due to the constraints that the community itself has imposed upon them, Starting to be a repeating pattern here with PvP, not everyone PvP's and not everyone wants too, imposing ideals upon others in a game based on survival, exploration, and teamwork is just short minded. Again, the game shouldn't be focused on such matters, PvP should have it's own strict rules, but not affect the core aspects of the game. Other games have went as far as separating out the PvE and PvP content, doing this here would make small ships a more viable option, as limits would be lifted, and building small, compact designs that perform can be ideal in the PvE realm of things. Space Engineers also doesn't have ship classifications in their build menus, other than Small Ship and Large Ship, what makes it a base is if it was built on the ground or setup as a satellite in space. What makes it a land vehicle in SE is the ability to put on wheels, I don't seen why such restrictions exist here, but here we are.

Despite all the negatives I've said this far, I cannot say I won't recommend this game, nor can give it an absolute positive, even with the restrictions that both the dev team and the community has imposed, it is still a lot of fun to play, sadly it force you to seek out others, in a game that isn't, by any means, a game designed around the MMO concept, but rather privately hosted servers in groups of maybe 2 to 10 people on average, which makes this more of a co-op game than anything else. Honestly I don't see that changing any time soon as many people play in different ways, and host their servers differently. Rules like repairs for equipment can be disabled, but enabled on others, the same also applies to other rule sets that can be shifted to better suit their own needs, or a community. With that, brings Uniqueness, and customization. The game host MANY ships, with many configs, and MANY scenarios that can better the story in a way, even allow you to fight toe to toe in a space fight with the Zirax, or other mysterious factions (not spoiling anything). 

The creativity is there, just need to ease up on ship building restrictions, lately its slowly being lifted, but I would like to see more battleship like turrets in the game instead of single barrel turrets, or the ability to have a heavy gunship/dropship made of small blocks that can be used to drop in infantry. and or provide heavy cover fire. We're in the backyard of an enemy that is relentless, so why would we impose such restrictions on our ships and ground vehicles?",1591045266,1682233020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

 I am playing in the Original Scenario now.  

The Tutorial is a much better experience, and the previous were good.  Starting Planets have a new but familiar line up: Akua is now your introductory Starter, and Omicron the Advanced, several others following in increasing difficulty, a new mix of challenges.  Reforged Eden is knocked out of whack by this 'experimental update' so expect some glitch fun.  

 So, at this point you could start playing and have the same new experience as I am with nearly 2700 hours in game.  There really needs to be a no spider mod though, like no spiders.  Not even in the basement of the Zirex BioLab, totally bogus, and hilarious.  EMPYRION!!!

There are problems - enemy destruction of underground structures, terrain otherwise undisturbed, terrain should be removed from impact also.  And I really appreciate Movado's frustration, this is a long a rather buggy stretch.

But, Empyrion Galactic Survival is still all I ever wanted in a game.  

It will get there.  

Still stands:  Roll Totally Vanilla First or Miss the Galactic Adventure Of your Game Life.

Thought I would try again to see if problems were solved. I don't know if the aforementioned was fixed but I found a game ending bug early. You can't go into water unless you want to die.  You can't swim and hit an invisible wall at the surface you can't get out of. Oh, yeah. You  heard me right, you can't get out of the water. (Dead). THIS IS A GAME ENDING BUG!!!!!!!!!! Are you kidding me. You really can't make this problem go away? Or do you not care?

After all of these years I come back to this? This is the #*$&%ist incompetent Dev team!...And you say you make games? What a worthless developer team. I hope one of you read this. You #*$%*%$ Failed!!! What a worthless team. As you can tell I am pissed. I really don't get your team making a game that was good, and taking a shit on it this way. This was a good game years, and years ago. They are now running backwards until it won't run on your computer. Please take your hard earned money elsewhere. 

********************************************************************************************************
I had played this game all through early access, and really enjoyed all of it at the time. I quit playing for a year or more and decided I would give it another go since Eleon released it as completed. 

This game is broken!!! Story missions do not work, and crafting freezes and doesn't auto create properly. Currently this Dev team is working on making water look pretty when they should be fixing game ending bugs. 

When starting a new single player game I started doing the story missions that had been added. Task missions, pretty creative right? I got as far as chapter 2 when the the story mission I was on did not progress. I found an option in the missions list that I could click and bypass to the next mission which is extremely weird! Must be because they knew missions were broken and didn't want to fix it, so they put a band-aid it.  

After bypassing this potion of the mission I was able to finish all other ""tasks"" in chapter 2. From there the game would not let me move on to chapter 3 and there was no way to Bypass, or manually move on. Went all over trying to trouble shoot, and what I found messed my game up even more! I would strongly recommend not getting this game. Games that don't work should not be $20.",1636940940,1681375684,False,11,0,0.548348903656005859,0,True,False,False

Hello. THIS IS NOT A RANT BUT AN HONEST REVIEW! I have played for about 3 hrs or less so far (More in 2023). I have really liked this game, but I am a sci-fi space exploration nerd. I do not play this game for the survival (Now I do). I play for pretty much every thing else, but the reason I can't recommend this is because it's just so unstable (The developers have greatly improved it's stability since when this was written). It randomly crashes so much, especially when on a planet (Fixed). You don't even have to go that far/fast in a ship and it'll just crash (Fixed!). For example I was walking around a Talon (alien) village and it crashed (Does not happen to me anymore). I haven't even gotten to space yet! Don't get me wrong this is a great game but when I cant get past a loading screen to join an OFFICIAL sever without the game just closing it self without warning or an error message appearing (Have not tried to join a server since then, therefore I can't tell you if it's been fixed or not). I cant recommend this for others.
If maybe it gets more stable in the near/far future then I could recommend this (It did. There have been many improvements since 2020). If that could happen, it would be one of my favorite games ever. I think my commas are out of wack,,,,,,,, oh well not re reading this again (to check for spelling errors).

I purchased this game in 2016. I played it for about 140hrs. I put it away as it was in EA and had lots of bugs. I recently returned to the game expecting lots of the bugs to have been fixed and find it more immersive and enjoyable. I've spent another 300+ hrs playing it in single player mode. I've completed all the missions available. I have a high end gaming PC.

On the positive side;

Initially the game is fairly immersive in that you have to struggle to survive. It is a grind and it has a mystery feel about it. The early stages of the game can keep you occupied for some time.

On the negative side;

The save mechanism is the worst of any game I've ever played. It overwrites your last save when you exit. It also overwrites saves that place you in altered positions/locals. It is also very unreliable. You have to save twice everytime you save to have any hope of returning back to where you want. Plus, the saves are huge. Each time you save it saves the whole complete game instead of a single point. 

The game has a very steep learning curve and has a information setup (Empyriocedia) which is all but useless. You can spend a long time reading it and still not find the info you need. You have to do a steam search to try and find info but, this can also be a waste of time. When they update the game they change things so if you read something that's more then 12 months old it may be irrelevant or outdated. This also applies to blueprints available in the workshop.

The community is toxic. The worst I've experienced on steam, which is really saying something as I've played a lot of FPS games. The so called experienced players are often very arrogant and obtuse. I've read posts where individuals, who appear to be youngsters, have been ridiculed for asking basic questions. And posts where people are having a problem but they remain unanswered. 

You are able to build a motorcycle early on to help get around. When I first used it in 2016 it handled like a 18 wheeler truck. Now it handles like an aircraft carrier! It is ridiculous. This is done intentionally to force you to  build a hovercraft, which makes no sense because by the time you can build a good hovercraft you can also build a good small flying craft called a SV. This is just one of the many things in this game that are nonsensical.

There is a huge list of medical aids you gather or can make. However, most of the time you are just better off dying rather then trying to fix yourself.(after you have learnt how to save correctly) One med will give you side-effects which you need another med to cure but it will also give you side effects and so on.  Even eating can be risky, and there is no warning about a dangerous foods. If you break your arm you will die in this game also.

Armoured space suites are available as you progress. Light, medium and heavy. Sounds ok but a mosquito can bite you through them or hail can kill you while wearing them. You can also die from radiation, overheating or freezing to death while wearing them. There is also an extra button you need to press to equip your helmet. 

The devs of this game add layers of complexity just to make you build things that shouldn't be needed. e.g. They make you build an oxygen tank for bases or vehicles, then you need to build a dispenser, then you need to build small oxygen tanks to fill the bigger tanks but you then need purified water to make the oxygen and you need to build a water purifier. Layers of complexity for no other reason then to have more complexity. Why not allow players to build an oxygen generator???

For a game that has a lot of shooting it has the worst hit register of any game I've played. You need to be standing in the open to shot an enemy or you will hit the object closest to yourself or them, yet they can hit you. And at the harder levels you only take one hit and die. Every monster or nasty is exactly the same on all planets.

The missions for this game are absolute rubbish. You have what they call an IDA to provide you with mission directives. The info it will give you is often false or misleading. Everything is type written nothing is spoken. It will tell you to search for planets that you won't be able to find. The galaxy map is a 3D mess of planets which is almost impossible to navigate. The last mission is the 11th chapter called Murky Christmas where you are actually going to rescue Santa Claus and you have to use a vehicle that is a replica of his slay complete with reindeer and presents in the back. Seriously....

This game has been in EA since it was released in 2015. There appears to be no time line for it's completion. Most of the work on the game so far has been nonsensical and slovenly. You end up with container after container full of rubbish and nothing to do except collect more.",1524045586,1680939218,False,0,1,0.447434127330780029,1,True,False,False

I really wanted to recommend Empyrion but this game is basically unfinished, but the fact remains this game varies from being alot of fun when things are going right without issues, then can quickly break your entire progress in a 'split second' when it doesn't, take for instance my final straw was minding my own business checking out an asteroid to farm in a mostly safe area,  an enemy CV just 'pops' up out of thin air and kills me and my mining SV in literally 2 seconds, and I'd like to say that is a rare thing...its not, this is because a large portion of the game relies on enemy spawns,  mining an asteroid?  Scanned for hostiles? All clear...start mining and 'pop' enemies spawn and unless you have a heavily armed and shielded ship, you could be dead in seconds and the same goes for ground combat with all manner of enemies popping up out of thin air. 

Meaning literally entire hours, days or even weeks can be flushed down the toilet in mere seconds if you are unlucky enough, or suffer some severe gamebreaking bug.   In single player,  you can at least literally save frequently enough and make a backup of that save file so if something exceptionally severe happen to your game, you can at least save scum but outside of that - it really is entirely possible to lose days and days worth of progress and most often, its not the players fault. 

When exploring POIs,  this happens frequently too with broken spawns,  enemies just popping up out of thin air and don't get me started about the ridiculously bad status effects and nonsense the developer thought was a good idea,  what kills you in this game most of the time isn't monsters, or being shot but dying of starvation because you get hit once,  status effect - parasites this time?  No your freezing cold? Oh you have an open wound? Most status effects also lead to more status effects so basically if you don't have access to a veritable array of med packs, detox kits, decontamination kits and other stuff then status effects *will* kill you and often in 20 seconds to a minute. 

Gunplay is also a huge problem, with enemies having exceptionally high accuracy at all times whilst player weapons are either weak, suffer from serious spread issues or just generally bad.  Let alone limited options, whilst enemies are often overpowered, can spawn in thin air and larger dangerous monsters can quite often insta-kill  you even if you are wearing Heavy Armor with mods,  since enemies AI is atrocious and basically always know exactly where the player is at all times, making bases either super difficult at first until you learn the base layout and spawn areas making finding the same base poi again trivial. 

Enemies also make no real sense either,  and that I get the unity engine has a lot of limitations here, but the variety of enemies is really really limited,  and they vary in terms of annoyance with little baby scorpions moving so fast and tiny they are a pain to shoot, and yes they too can stack you up with deadly status effects,   weapons themselves are weak or pathetic like the T3 minigun and you'll see this issue pop up in treads constantly too,  I personally had to add a combat rebalance mod to make weapons just a bit better.

Exploration can be fun, arguably this is the main focus of the game outside building bases and ships,  lots to explore, *if* you don't get bored easily,  the main gameplay loop is scan area,  check out, find poi? Explore poi, leave area rinse and repeat until you find a major POI then its either die a few times whilst exploring and eventually clear the POI, find a few epic weapons and a ton of resources then rinse and repeat. 

Whilst the space gameplay loop is pretty much the same except that is significantly riskier since you, your ship and everything inside it is at risk of permanent loss,  no 'elite dangerous' style insurance as your ship and contents pop up at the last save point,  basically if you die in space, you have 3 options.   Accept the loss, build another ship and crawl back what you lost,   reload an earlier save game at the cost of potentially SIGNIFICANT time lost, or  basically quit the game and move on.    This hardcore aspect of space survival is intriguing for most people, especially akin to souls-like players and that is fine with a risk vs reward system but the system needs to be bug free, and this isn't at all with so many things like even a simple mining an asteroid can trigger a spawn and if you get unlucky or even very early in the gameplay cycle it can literally be devastating and even gamebreaking entirely, even using ""cheats"" like godmode does not protect your ships, only you so really at the end of the day? What is the point of spending hours to build ships to have them destroyed in seconds during a bad encounter,  for all intent and purposes Empyrion is more like a souls-like combined with a Rogue-Lite space survival game that is more hardcore than it really should be.

Space portion of the game could be so much better if it wasn't so buggy and exceptionally punishing on the player when it bugs out,  just yesterday playing co-op my friends teleport bugged out and was forced to use cheat codes in order to actually just repair the game to a playable state, these bugs are not that common but still - shows something is wrong.

In closing,  Empyrion is basically the dark souls of space survival,  and sadly have to say this is one of the best space survival games because the genre is so horribly under represented with AAA developers never touching this genre, even Starfield isn't going to be like Empyrion because of the extensive building aspects. 

Empyrion could have been so much better if it wasn't for the bugs,  the punishing gameplay cycle which often hinges on you possibly losing serious amounts of playtime if you don't have a recent save game then once again, too bad so sad.    If you don't mind the possibility of losing potentially everything, and like a challenge albeit a one sided and often pretty unfair manner then Empyrion is the game you might enjoy,  its got a lot of potential but some of the major quirks and issues eventually just makes it more frustrating and less fun rather than engaging.

Empyrion needs basically more tech, more levels beyond 25+,  fixing of bugs,  more options for players including ability 'not' to lose everything in single player if you die because, lets face it - bugs can happen.   Empyrion also needs better difficulty sliders, ranging from at easy giving the ability to respawn with your ship/possessions through to classic hardcore, with many settings in between to tailor make your experience  because I see the threads all over the place complaining, but at the same time just accepting this games building is fun, everything else isn't. 

Empyrion should still be considered in a early access state.",1680728409,1680926774,False,163,13,0.864472270011901855,0,True,False,False

I play a modified version of the game based on the popular Reforged Eden modification. I play on the Anvil community server. All my views are based on that version & server.

[h1]In a nutshell[/h1]
The game has decent graphics and thematic sound. It can be thought of as a mix of Elite Dangerous and No man's Sky. You can use the block-based system to build bases, ships and hovercrafts to your delight. The workshop has an entire legacy of items for you to peruse.
In the Reforged Eden scenario there are extra quests on top of those in vanilla. You can choose to follow those or simply make your own way around the thousands of systems, each with planets, moons, asteroid belts, and various unknown sites.
The Points Of Interest are varied and diabolically challenging.

You can set up your own server or hire one online or play on one of the many public servers out there. Playing solo is entirely possible, but I personally enjoy being part of a larger community.",1680781582,1680781665,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm seeking refund and no longer wish to be a  part of their community, whatever their reasons for their intolerant attitudes, they are flawed. And they've infringed upon my right of free speech, which no TOS is taking away from me under any circumstance. Get real, you can't take away basic human rights with the stroke of a pen, and no one agree's with a TOS to begin with. We want to play the game, not spend 500 dollars with our lawyer trying to figure out if we've sold our soul. You can't have it.

It was fun while it lasted though, shame the developers are just the kind of people I can't stand.

Quite aside from one of their recent updates burning out my GPU in 3 seperate bluescreen crashes, they marginalized me and restricted my account when I expressed my displeasure on their forums. Granted, my post contained a curse word. A single curse word, which as we all know, forums are well equipt to censor without bothing someone to watch their language, and then restricting their right to post based on that.

Additionally, no help or acknowledgment of said bug was made, so the fact that my minor single slip of pure frustration took higher priority than a bug that basically breaks machines with a Geforce 750m graphics card, really really offended me. I would call this both poor support and an intolerant attitude, and seeing as their are tools that turn curse into *****, I really don't find their action acceptable at all. 

More over I believe humans have a right to safety, a right to privacy, and a right to expression in all things. Freedom of the press and freedom of speech are what keep governments on their toes, working, hopefully, for their people. Instead of manipulating them into a condition they find acceptable, by restricting our rights and our access to information.

Given that, I will not grant a company any right, explicitely or implied, to censor me in any way beyond turning my cussing into ****ing. I have chosen to express myself in this manner, because I have encountered an issue that increases my blood pressure greatly. Increased blood pressure contributes to a shortened lifespan, and if it is causing that, and also causing one to have to out more money, then it is an issue that needs to be addressed properly.

Censoring my posts and my rights is not how to deal with an issue of that type, reprimanding me for a circumstance within your control is another example of increasing my blood pressure and shortening my lifespan. Thus I have withdrawn my support for this game, and this company, as I wish to live a long, healthy, and happy life. And I believe I can more capably do so when I can express myself.

Frying my computer is less a problem than striking against my rights however, in my opinion. Others may feel differently, and for them, there shall be Trump. Thankfully I'm Canadian, and while we had Harper, he is no more. And Trudeau stands a decent chance of turning our Country into a Respected and Peacekeeping force in the world.

But yes, this company needs to adjust its attitude and its level of tolerance when it comes to its player base. People are going to cuss like sailors ingame, like they do in any, all, and every game. Thinking you can censor it forcefully by threatening players with restricted rights and hard words is just foolish, and insulting. What excuse can you even use? I've played Halo, I know what its like to be cussed at by a prepubescent child, its generally less getting a point across and just a stream of high voiced annoying hatred.

An no amount of harsh words shall stop it.

Anyways, if you can put up with the developers bs, and the game doesn't break your machine, then in all honesty the game is pretty ok fun. And it seemed like it was headed in a decent direction, last time I actually got to play. My objections are moral and support based, their morals are questionable and their support doesn't seem to exist. Beyond that, this wall of text is all I have to say.

Good hunting, and I hope you find the Space/Empire/Sandbox/Building/Scifi game for you. Been on the hunt myself, and I was enjoying Space Engineers until Empyrion fried my god****ed GPU!

Edit 2023 - They're still massive fuck ups, and there's still a limitless amount of bugs that remain unpatched. Game launching in the wrong monitor. Can't run while using a controller. Weapons Boresight view is misaligned. Frequent disconnections while changing playfield areas resulting in potentially lost *ships* not to mention potentially lost vehicles. Glitched terrain physics that sometimes allow your vehicle to fall through the ground to the center of the freaking planet. North and South Pole terrain caps still build restricted and navigation is somewhat uncertain there. There's a difficulty level bug, so easy is medium and hard is harder than the game ever was. 

The worst part is most of these bugs aren't even new. The polar terrain, ground fall, and playfield disconnect have all been in the game since I first bought it. That was something like 3+ years ago now.

And that's without bringing up the gameplay issues, which themselves are more than a little unreasonable. Enemies can hit you over unrealistic range, injuries are extremely common and accompanied by *severe* status effects. You can only use your shoulder mounted light with a helmet on, wearing armor. Otherwise its nonfunctional. So to see at night, you also need to consume oxygen for no reason. Assuming the planet your on has a breathable atmosphere.

Turret tracking is pretty crap, boresight vehicle weapons have zero accuracy at all considering the gameplay issues in any playfield. Using a fixed weapon is borderline impossible on a vehicle, you're basically required to use the AI controller weapons. Which, I have to say, should also be controllable in manual fire mode with a hotkey or in a gimbled fire mode front facing. 

I am a massive fan of this game, but the only developers I can compare to them come from The Isle. They're equally terrible, equally arrogant, equally insufferable and equally deaf to feedback or advice. I love the game, can we just buy it from the developers into the public sphere so we can fix it up and have something nice?

Hours played:  about 320 in vanilla and about 340 in multiplayer (mp) at the USG-Pegasus server.

In vanilla, I could go back to a previous SAVE if I got stuck.  In mp, I could only start where I left off.  In mp, two players helped me out of death predicaments and one player gifted me with a ship early on.  The gift motivated me to play on in mp when I would have quit otherwise.  If you decide to play on the USG-Pegasus server, you will appreciate the helpfulness of the admins and other players.  All I had to do was ask and--POOF--instant help with various things like ship, money, supplies or transportation.

This is the first mp I've ever played for so long.  Any others I only tried for an hour or so.  I was very much enjoying vanilla when the devs made a big update, 1.6, that destroyed my SAVES.  I was about 80% into the story line and was addictively playing Empyrion.  The devs didn't respond to my request for help, so I gave mp a try.

Issues with mp:  Many internet disconnects occurred.  I was thrown from my ship too often and had to figure out ways to get back to it without starving or dying of cold.  I nearly gave up on the game when my ship radar failed to pick up on an enemy station.  Whether the invisible station was cloaked by design or was a bug, I don't know.  But it was almost the final straw that broke this camel's back as my ship and cargo were destroyed. 

Until I met this invisible enemy station, my radar devices would always pick up on upcoming targets.  The radar would first show a question mark and a color indicating what faction or special location I might be approaching.  Moving closer, the name of the location would be revealed.  It was an engaging exploration design that kept me coming back for more game play.

Depth of game play:  Excellent!  I think I completed less than 5% of the story line in mp before I flew off doing over 300 hours of independent discovery.  Some players have said once you create a powerful capital ship, the game is essentially completed.  I had a capital ship in vanilla and felt I had hundreds of hours to go before tiring of Empyrion.  At 340 hours in mp, I had two small ships, a hover craft and a motorbike with no base structure yet built to call home--just getting started!  Expecting 1000 to 2000 hours of eventual game play, 660 hours isn't that much.  Weird, my feeling this way, since 660 hours is a lot of bang for the buck.

EDIT:  I've continued play for over 1000 hours now.  Just farting around with planet exploration and shooting baddies from my SV (small vessel).  I had saved up to buy a CV (capital vessel) for more power shooting of baddies on planets but was disappointed to find the CV weapons weren't allowed planetside--only the SV weapons were.  

Another disappointment:  It takes a long time to improve reputation with some factions.  Why bother?  One reason is to be able to teleport to stations of a faction once my rep is 'friendly' with that faction.  The problem:  The time consuming rep improvement gets removed on major game updates or server reformats.  However, the USG Pegasus server allows you to purchase faction rep for real money if you care to do so.

A help:  When you get thrown from your ship due to internet disconnects or if you can't get back to your ship due to pilot error, the USG Pegasus server comes to the rescue with a handful of powerful commands that can take you to your ship or bring your ship to you.  

Another help:  Virtual backpack storage.  There are six free ones, vb1 through vb6.  You can pay real money for more even though a lot of items can be stored in vb1 through vb6.  The USG Pegasus server promise has been that this storage is free from corruption, disconnects and update wipes.  So far, so good for me on this storage.  Anything in this protected storage can be retrieved instantly for use at any time.

2/28/22 update:  WOW!  I just lost my virtual backpack storage.  Over 700 billion credits and copious amounts of ore/ingots vanished.  The USG Pegasus server claims the devs did an update that affected the programming code for the virtual backpacks.

This warrants a THUMBS DOWN even though I've put over 1100 hours into the game.

3/30/22 update:  Virtual backpacks are 'fixed' for the USG Pegasus server but you can't get a free one and must pay a good amount of ingame credits to obtain one.  Good implementation.  However, be careful while transferring items to/from a virtual backpack during internet disconnects.  Your items can vanish. 

My attitude remains 50/50 for this game.  It's fun but the wary game player must accept losing progress, credits and items at various times through no fault of his own.

7/5/22 update:  Finally, beware of overzealous administrators in mp who may ban you forever for harmless griefing where no one gets injured or loses property.  USG Pegasus ought to measure out its punishment in a more balanced way such as a warning first, followed by a one week ban, etc.  As it is, you may have helped many players in the game only to have it all taken away in an instant by quick-to-complain new players who don't understand the game's built in protections.

4/3/23 update:  It's nice when a server has a headquarters.  Wolfpack RE has one now!  It's a favorite haunt of mine.  HWS RE EU has one as well as USG Pegasus.

- Building is fun
- Massive universe & lots to do

Cons:
- Most of the quests are broken. Very buggy and unstable.
- Ground combat is 0/5. It's like worst I've ever seen. Enemies about one shot you if you're not wearing heavy armor and if you are, you can't use jetpack. Fights are always too easy or too hard.

The ability to customize a ship completely with voxel block shapes in a game with decent graphics, and then send it into space is about the only thing left that makes it play worthy. You'll need a mega computer to run it without it crashing constantly. The enemies remain ""early access"" in this game, there is variety, however they are always getting stuck in collision boxes, I've seen more challenging, less buggy enemies in dull Nintendo 64 games to put it lightly. Without any kind of challenge besides bugs, this game feels really empty too, there isn't much of a reason to explore beyond finding resources to put together ships or trading. So once you have a good ship with all the travel features, you've beaten the game unless you enjoy trading for in-game currency that becomes meaningless over a short period of time. There was endless potential to this game but the developers have had a falling out, and they have just left people with the feeling that no one on the team has the proper knowledge to finish the game...

This should still be in Alpha as it's terribly optimized and littered with bugs.  Players need to learn the bugs & how to avoid or fix them when they happen, which is why this should still be an Alpha.  In the past year, we've seen the following additions to the game: Waves in water, new armor/person model (which looks terribly fake), new weapons that look like nerf guns, and they've now added a running animation for when you fall off a platform.  Yes, that's right, those are the major additions to an open world, space exploration, survival game.  The current developer staff seems unable to make major changes because they simply do not know how to.  In my opinion, they are over their head and have no way to truly improve the game due to lack of skill/knowledge.  They are truly only focused on making the early game look better, to sell more copies of the game.  They are not adding any noticeable amount of content.  

During a testing session where one of their developers (Taelyn) was present, and trying to understand a common bug where player ships disappear(!), he acknowledged their database guy (who is no longer with Eleon) was terrible & the cause of some of these issues.  However, only a few minutes later, he also stated that in order to fix the issue, they would need to talk to that developer & nobody else could fix it.  If he’s that bad, why can’t the current staff handle this, or find a other person to do this work?   

The first person aspect is absolutely terrible.  Enemies zig zag erratically, have aimbot like accuracy, get stuck within buildings facing walls, fall through the floors of buildings (and shoot you while clipped inside the structure), fall through the ground (and also shoot you while under ground).  Space combat is just way too unbalance & easy as well.  

New content is mostly non-existent unless provided by the gaming community.  New buildings (POI's) & ships are generally player built. 

Can the game be fun to play?  Yes, if you like to redo the same grind over & over, or build ships/bases in creative mode.  However, for 2023, I don't see a bright future of anything new.  The pace of updates & changes is very slow, and the bugs are extremely exhausting to deal with.

Multiplayer: It works pretty well and seems pretty stable. No real issues with it so far.
Gameplay: It's a fun and engaging game right from the moment you crash on a planet. Creatures will jump you and you have some work to do
Ship building: Lots of options here, I love options lol.
Space: You can fly your creations to space and actually build a base in space

Ok now the bad about this game
Content, content, content: They have not added a single new thing to do in over two years. They just keep fixing things and adding useless systems
Weights, and cpu: I'm glad you can turn this useless nonsense off. I don't get why you would add weights and measures to a game with next to no physics in it. What a massive waste of time and resources. Cpu just seems useless and pointless
Graphics and animations: These are just terrible. They look like something from 2005. Some of the worst animations out there.
Sound: The sound has no filter, creatures sound like they are right on top of you the entire time. This needs help
Space: It's empty. Once you get a ship to space there isn't much to do except look for rare ores
Combat: The npc's never miss when they fire. I don't see why the npcs need to land almost every hit lol.

All in all it's a decent game. I have accepted the fact that we have gotten all of the content we are going to get. There doesn't seem to be anything new to do on the horizon. It's a shame as this game has sooooo much potential.  It's a decent builder and fun for the first 2-3 hours.

The devs hate modders yet can't fix basic animation issues. 

Zero end game design has been thought through and ironically it's the community that provides the most compelling play through scenario... and even that comes with a lot of stat changes to enemy damage and energy consumption amongst other things that the devs failed to balance.

Some fundamental features that you see in most modern open world games like dynamic events, or the ability to conquer planets and expand your factions influence on the galaxy map are just not done or even on their radar.

Lately, they have been deleting feedback and comments that are negative on their ""update"" announcements. And when I say ""update"" - things like fixing fall animation that any half-wit animator could do in an afternoon is treated like a seasonal triumph.

Old Review:
Despite playing this game on and off for years I cannot recommend this game anymore. It's yet another game that wasn't ready to leave early access. It's still a buggy mess, lacking content, a completed story, and overall it needs about 5 more years of development and polish before being released at 1.0.

But if you can stick with it for 8+ hours and put a bit of determination into it, you can really see what a good game this is. I picked this up because I have loved Space Engineers and put  1000+ hours into it (yeah, I know, rookie numbers compared to some!). But ultimately SE did get a bit boring. The mods really helped, but it never really felt like there was anything to do after a certain point. I loved that game, and will ultimately go back to it, but I fancied giving this a go.

Players can gather resources, construct their own bases, and even design and build their own spacecraft from scratch. This level of customization allows players to tailor their gameplay experience to their liking and ensures that no two playthroughs are ever the same.

The game's graphics are impressive, with beautiful and varied environments that truly capture the feeling of exploring alien worlds. The sound design is also excellent, immersing players in the game's atmosphere and adding to the overall sense of adventure.

You know the Eleon team put their heart in just by reading the detailed ingame guidlines to help us at starting. The game is nice to look with the shaders effects, day-night natural cycle, weather, various landscapes, sky, lakes and seas. A great variety of creatures and plants, each one with its own behaviour, benefits or danger. The sound ambiance make the immersion complete, but sometimes, like in jungle, I may find the environment sound too loud compared to your own noises.

There is a lot of talent invested in the structures designs too. Some fun and surprise in the hidden stuff and places you can find, some that are freaky also telling you that you may be outgunned. Here exploration is a necessity, but also made interesting and very rewarding from what you learn and what you get.

The game mechanics are really accessible by their simplicity and ergonomy. Like in every game there are specficities with objetcts and their interactions, information panels… Item context information are rich. Also the Steam Community is really helpful. Don't forget to search on the community discussion for specific questionning.

Like for every game launched we love, with anticipated access or not, my hope is to see the Team to develop it to its full potential! There is nothing in gaming more disapointing than a missed potential. Apparently Eleon team works on it and I really hope they will bring shortly the best.

Personnally I’m not at “mid-game” yet, far away I guess. I have much to play and discover, like space travelling. For now I'm with a hover vessel that is great to pilot and building is easy. Bring the final touch with the paint pistol to color/texture a block face, the whole block or several blocks/block faces at a time. Go in exploration, don't forget the minigun turrets! :D Fight against the faction that bothers you, or all of them if you are the hegemonious kind unlike me, loot their bases with no mercy. Personal recommandation is to fight Zirax and be at peace with the two others since they are both related.

The only things I learned after getting out of the tutorials were the same things I knew before I went into them, plus things like 'hovercraft can simply decide to not function, randomly, with no explanation given as to why' and 'this block that is a part of a base is actually a different part of a different base that just so happens to be directly next to it, and your generator/fueltank placement were therefor wrong and guess what? you can't pick them back up again, so go harvest more resources to build new ones 1 space over from your original placement so you can progress!'

Personally I find this game very relaxing and enjoy playing it after work and on the weekends. 
It's still work in progress and receives regular updates. 
There are a lot of POIs [Point of Interest] to explore and the game mechanics are amazing [The bugs can sometimes piss you off but I'm sure they will be fixed sooner or later]. You can create your own Ship Blueprints and use them ingame and share it with the community via workshop. How cool is that ?!
Once you learn how to play the game in vanilla, I highly recommend subscribing to Reforged Eden Scenario on the steam workshop. 
HUGE PROPS to the amazing Empyrion Community and players who create brilliant scenarios, workshop content/ blue print designs and are extremely welcoming accross all platforms !

[h1]Does it Run on linux / proton ? [/h1]
Yes, Proton 7.0.6.

[h1] The Story [/h1]
Your falling from the sky, burning and almost dead. Finding your way through this 
harsh environment. Start mining through the destructible terrain. Farming food when you 
established your base. Then craft some vehicles to explore the planet. Or even build 
your own start destroyer and head  off to the universe. I mean, start with the moons first, 
cause you got to take care of everything. Like getting quantum fuel.

[h1] Level Design? [/h1]
Its an open-world-universe where you can find danger and loot at many different spots.
You get a good tutorial on what or how you can do things and spend hours on building or mining.
You might want to get a friends, cause its also coop, or online PvP.

[h1] Development [/h1]
Always new updates. Always improving and listening to the community. Can absolutely recommend.
I have been watching and playing this game for over 2 years now.

[h1] When to buy [/h1]
Anytime, when you feel the urge to play or wait for a sale.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
There is so much to do. Fighting, Farming, Building, Crafting. Upgrading.
Exploring. You probably find a community where you can get a ""job""
and make a living.(in game)

There is a lot in the game, its certainly more fun with friends, tho even then the missions dont work perfectly with others, you'll find yourself skipping around in the task list.

It's far from flawless but the developers are still working hard after the 1.0 release.  Well worth $20. 

   Don't expect epic space battles in your first 5 or even 10 hours, at least your first time playing.  Play the in-game tutorial for a bit and then look up online tutorials once you understand the basics.  You might have your own ship up and flying in a few hours in your second play through.  It's more about crafting than combat so maybe pass if you are looking for a pure action game.  You can download ship designs from the workshop but you'll still need to find and mine the materials.

   The potential for ship and base building is why so many people have thousands of hours on this game.  It doesn't have absolutely everything you might want, but it has more freedom than almost any other game, and I find the creation tools to be easier and more fluid than most games with this level of complexity.  There is a creative mode so you can ignore the exploration and mining if all you want to do is build.  I prefer to build and save my ships in creative mode, then just supply the resources to auto-construct them from blueprints in survival mode.  You can also play the story with unlimited health and resources.

   I've been playing this for years and the amount of work and community interaction the developers have put into this title is astounding.  Any fears of them moving on after the 1.0 release have been thoroughly put to rest.

Obviously if these things aren't an issue for you then you'll probably like it.

Other than that, the performance and controls are still awful which gives me even less reason to grind through the long slog towards understanding the game. 

It's a shame because I love games in this genre with similar mechanics, it's just that this game makes absolutely no effort to be accessible in any form.

** The good **

- Immersive. I've spent hours progressing, building and exploring. Unlike most survival voxel games, this one  has a deep story and missions that are fun to follow.

- Less of a grind: a lot of survival games tend to by grindy where you spend hours mining and collecting resources. I liked how in Empyrion, you can set various difficulty settings to make it less grindy and more casual. For example, you can remove the storage limit for mass/volume, CPU limits and set various resource sizes and mining speeds. It's also great that you can scavange for resources and even take over bases and ships, so you do not have to mine and build everything from scratch. The ship factory option allows you to auto-builld ships that other players spent hours designing. Just add resources to the factory and it'll build the ship.

What could be better:
- Others have mentioned gun play as being a bit unbalanced. Eg even with heavy armor it takes only a few hits and you're dead. There are no stealth elements so often times you find yourself getting shot at from unknown direction and by the time you figure it out you're dead. Would be good if they added stealth element where the player can sneak, and hide. Alternatively, add a hud element that shows direction where the damage is coming from.

- The AI doesn't seem very smart, and enemies can't see through transparent voxels such as windows and scaffolding. It's also impossible to shoot through scaffolding. It feels like the tough enemies and weak player's armor compensate for having weak AI. Conversely you end up exploiting weak AI to have an edge.

- The story mission ends abruptly with a ""to be continued"", leaving the player wanting for more. Once story ends, the game feels like any other non-story sandbox game where there's no longer much to do.

*** The bad **

The game can be extremely immersive for a voxel survival builder, but there are some annoyances where it almost feels like the developer goes out of their way to break our suspension of disbelief and remind us that we are playing an early access game and helping them test it (it's no longer early access).

Some examples:

- Every in-game mission mentions the developer's real world email address and encourages us to email them if they find bugs in the mission. Not the best place to put this, as there already is a bug report button in the UI. 

- The developer goes out of their way to break our suspension of disbelief by describing an in-game story NPC, Alex, as having a gender neutral name because the developer promises to add a future feature allowing us to customize the NPC's gender. Why mention this within the game? You either have the feature or you don't. Would anybody notice if you didn't? There are easier and more streamlined ways to do diversity and inclusion anyway, the story already has multiple characters of different genders and races. Take example from sci fi shows like The Peripheral or The Expanse where its done well: high degree of character diversity presented casually without being in-your-face about it.

The bottom line:
An indie diamond in the rough that is a lot of fun to play despite some flaws. Some seem like an easy fix as well (attn develope: stop reminding us in the game that we're playing a game).

Check out my playtime on this game, it's high, and it's because I've been playing this game and supporting it since and throughout its EA campaign years ago. The game in itself isn't bad, in fact it's pretty satisfying. The development has been a bit slow at times and to this day it's still quite buggy but there are probably good reasons for that which I don't feel too confident to look into.


[h1] Immature behavior from the Devs [/h1]
The reason why I'm putting in a negative review is because of the immature attitude of the devs themselves. I have been critical on their forum about the fact that after 6 years of EA and a 1.0 release they still have their community doing the Localization for free, without even putting much effort into it. The results are botched, unprofessional translations made by amateurs, which is fine for EA games made by devs with little to no budget, but for a game that sold so well, it's borderline insulting to the foreign players, notably when you claim on your Steam Store Page that the game is localized. Sometimes it's not, there are entire areas of the game that's not translated as I'm writing this review. Just go check out their thread about the Localization ""efforts"" put in place to see what I'm talking about.

I said just that, in a similar tone on their forum, and I was silenced and flagged as inappropriate for speaking up. They did not take the time to formulate a response or explain, they just went the easy way with plain censorship (they deleted my comments) and intimidation (they flagged me as inappropriate). The devs clearly don't care about their players' feedback, and I've seen many testimonies from other players about this kind of behavior. Why would they bother when they can get away with it and still sell their game?

No this negative review is not petty, it's the only way I can actually express my discontent now. Had they not censored me and instead responded to my comments on their forum, this review would not exist.


[h1] Community translations VS Professional translations [/h1]
In case you've read this far, you probably are interested in this topic or at least curious, and might be wondering why this is such a big deal, let me explain: the video games industry is quite infamous for mistreating their workforce, notably freelancers; crunch time, sexual harassement, precarious contracts, underpaid employees, you name it. 

A lot of unscrupulous devs out there will use the fact that people are passionate about games to abuse them into doing work in poor conditions, or, in this case, work for free. The Translators community is one of the worst-treated group in the lot, as most of them have to get multiple clients and work over the weekends to make a decent salary, despite having skills that they acquired through studies and experience AND despite helping the Devs sell their game around the world. Most of the time they are not even credited for their work, and thus struggle to build an impressive portfolio/resume that would help them get more work.

When a successful Dev team takes the decision to use their Community to get free translations, they become part of the problem. This is the case for Eleon Studios, and instead of addressing this concern on their forums, they simply shrug it off and shut the door, and the reason behind that is simple: they don't care and this is why I don't think we should support them.",1676528573,1676582618,False,142,11,0.717802524566650391,33,True,False,False

I've played Empyrion on and off for years now, with quite a few hours under my belt.  It has a lot of strong points - the building and Base/Ship logistics are one of those.  You can build anything you want within the rules the game sets out, and you can mine/forage for resources to support those creations.  You can travel from planet to planet, system to system freely (and with no loading screens) - depending on your ability to handle foes in different places.  It's a great sandbox from that perspective, especially for being voxel-based.

Where it falls down, as indicated, is the poor ground gunplay for one.  Hampered by bugs, it makes it an almost untenable situation where enemies make no noise, are absolute aim-bots that kill you in just a couple of hits (even with armor on), and which respawn if you decide to reload earlier in a mission.  Stealth is practically non-existent, and there's no cover system implemented.  My latest attempt at a mission had over eight (8) minigun drones flying around when there were only supposed to be 3.  Some of the enemies I was supposed to kill (while the minigun drones hunted me simultaneously) were rocket-launcher variants, and many of their shots were able to damage me even while behind solid, full-thickness walls.  There's no tagging system, so identifying friend-or-foe (IFF) takes time - time which the AI doesn't need at all.  Clearly a lot of the gunplay and associated mechanics haven't received the attention they need.

Performance around some of the medium-to-large POIs is in the trash, unfortunately.  With a machine that can easily handle recent releases, and 4k games (including a 2080ti and 64GB of RAM), it struggles to keep even 30 FPS at 1440p/medium settings in those POIs.  That adds a second layer of complication to ground based battles - the lag.  It's an unnecessary disadvantage for the player when faced with any number of aim-bot enemies.

AI on flying enemies is likewise rather poor.  Drones will often (while hunting you) smash into each other, then circle their new partner endlessly up into the sky.  Bipedal troops won't seek cover, but rather kneel down and shoot with surgical precision (despite being called ""blanks"", which are mindless automatons).  They should have nowhere near the precision they do, and yet 70% or more of their shots land every time, from great range.  Add that to their omniscient knowledge of you whenever you pop out of cover, and it's frustrating to say the least.

The developers keep working on the game, modders keep modding for it.  You'll find some good overhauls out there (Reforged Eden among them), and a literal ton of different kinds of ships for the factory to pump out.  But it feels like enjoying it has become a struggle due to the lackluster ground game.

If you have endless amounts of patience for the game, and are more interested in building things as opposed to combat, it should fit the bill nicely for you.  If you're looking for a good all-around space style sandbox and don't really want to invest dozens of hours into finding out how things work (and why many don't work well at all), then either wait for a seriously deep sale, or just hold off for future improvements.

I'll keep playing it, due to having loads of patience available, and due to enjoying the building & logistics portion of the game.  But it often ends up a ""walk away and come back to it later"" affair for me, for the reasons listed above.  Perhaps someday I'll be able to flip the review to a thumbs up.  Keeping fingers crossed.

The campaign is unfinished and buggy, and poorly scripted using broken English (the developers are German). The plot is decent, perhaps because the developers have shown some love to game modders and gained some inspiration from them. But the engine is fantastic. With it, you can build fully customized bases, hover vessels, small vessels, and capital ships out of a broad array of moderately complex set of parts and paintable, texturable blocks. You can develop your own and save their blueprints or publish them to the workshop - or you can download a stunning array or blueprints and scenarios from the workship. And you can use them to explore a large galaxy full of player or developer-designed patrol ships and points of interest, each associated with factions and faction reputations.

Some of the mods available are truly impressive, including the massive and professional Reforged Eden, which really makes the vanilla galaxy come alive. But the willingness of the player base to provide custom factions such as the Brotherhood of Farr or the Kriel Empire, and the developers' willingness to absorb their blueprints and lore in to the vanilla game (even referring to them in the campaign) really highlight what makes the universe feel worth exploring. 

EGS is Minecraft in Space - but it's more beautiful and flexible with each update, complex enough to provide interesting building and exploration challenges. Yet it has a better combat experience and a more forgiving learning curve than games like Space Engineers.

I did, and there is some PvP content here, but the content is also lackluster and the ship building flat out feels a lot worse, as does resource management.

There's a lot more ""things"" to find and go explore but eventually you'll realize they boil down to prefab buildings with angry AI in it that you have to, for the most part, painfully out cheese to get to whatever maguffin is inside. Unlike in Space Engineers there doesn't seem to be any real automation so you'll frequently be taking trips back and forth from inventory containers to do basic tasks. Building anything meaningful is a pain. Survival mechanics are there and are neat, but they are fairly easy to achieve, even in harder scenarios.

I started playing with Alpha 3 and this game became very fast one of my favorite games. 

I'm still playing older Alphas, like Alpha 3 - 10, cause i like them alot.

The Devs & The Community. 

Oh boy! I've never seen such a community. 
NEVER critize anything. 

If you criticize something to the developers, even if it's just to start an exchange of ideas, you go through 4 stages: 

1.) The developers only respond briefly and what you write is wrong. 
2.) The developers post you a link and in it you can read their opinion.
3.) The developers explain to you again why their will and their opinion alone is the right one. 
4.) The developers do not understand you anymore. 

This is mixed with hate and insulting comments from the community. 

Also the game was great and i always thought: Now just fix bugs and the game could be ready.
But they added more and more content, and now they have that big, but still buggy game. 

I will have a look at this game in the future again, but so far.. I cant recommend it.

Edit: As of 2023 the game is still buggy as hell, runs very poor but devs keep adding stuff instead of polishing the game.",1596635902,1674988937,False,22,0,0.594208180904388428,0,True,False,False

I have clocked almost 400 hours into this game, including the Reforged Eden mod. Had a lot of fun doing it, but the game just ran it's course..Nowadays I just revisit when im bored and quit soon after.

The good:
-Totally customized ship/base building. You can tailor a build for a specific situation and spend hours perfecting it. It took me countless tries to just come up with a good light fighter, a cheap scout ship, a neat interior for my mobile base.
-You can impose restraints on said builds to make designing more interesting.
-A wide variety of planets.
-Janky old school graphics.
-Solar systems that feel alive with shit flying around,. Some you can take, some you can't just yet.
-Space horror first person combat.

The neutral:
-Grind. It's an older survival game, what do you expect
-Unless you master building ships, you end up with the same shapes all over.
-There is a main quest, it just isn't interesting.

The bad:
-Ship to ship combat devolves into slogging matches eventually.
-On foot combat is CRAP. You need the precision and mobility of Quake 3, you won't get it. Enemies swarm you and fuck you up beyond any reasonable standard.
-Add respawning enemies to that.
-Add cheesy traps.
-Points of interests becoming old very fast. Soon you just try to nuke them from orbit.
-NPCs from 20 years ago.
-Unless you are really creative, you end up with a couple standard ship designs.
-A couple of crucial building blocks are still missing, so you get locked in certain angles for slopes etc.",1674676307,1674676307,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are more than enough places and planets to visit and to conquer, aliens/drones/animals attacks to survive and what you may build is only limited by your fantasy. Epecially in case of building ships, Empyrion glances with the perfect amount of blocks and possibilities, not too much to be confusing and not too few to be insufficient. Another aspect which works better than in concurrent products is the controllability, in some other games walking on planets is like floating in space but with an obstacle beneath you - that's not the case here, everything is smooth and quite realistic. And it looks great!
Thanks, guys!

PS: Some years (and 4000 hours) later. The game is constantly changing, from the mechanics and visuals to the AI. Sadly, it doesn't change into a better game but into a bad copy of Ark/NoMansSky/SpaceEngineers. It has the harsh and unrealistic graphics of NoMansSky and the whacky controls of SpaceEngineers with no real enhancements in areas it would really need (the motorbike doesn't drive like in real life since its appearance in alpha 1.2 or so, building blocks are not intrinsic consistent,...). The good news is, the old versions are still available as ""beta""s, so there's always a version for every taste to choose from.

This is version 1.9 and was recently updated to 1.9.2.

Changing my recommendation to ""yes, with qualifications.""

What's improved:
There is now a lot more NPC content and you won't die multiple times before even getting a base started.  So that's an improvement.

What I don't like:
The tutorial needs improvement, it's very text heavy and I always felt like I was getting bombarded with a lot of text and not sure what it is exactly I should do.

Finding some ores is more difficult than it should be, such as gold.  The only way I found it was an obscure forum post saying where to look, but even then it's a long grind to find enough gold ore to make into an ingot to create the booster pack you want.

The missions that the NPCs give seem to be more about grinding than doing anything useful.

The teleporter between planets in the starting system, nice touch, but need to warn someone that they'll need something to protect against the environment before they teleport.

The Supply Depot POI, I don't know what to do with this one, I can hear NPCs within the structure, but can't figure out where to go from here.  

I'll end it here.  There's still more for this as a WIP, but glad to see some balance brought back to the start and additional content.

-----------------previous review below-------------------------

Came back to this game after being away from it for many months.  I had enjoyed playing this game in past, it needed some help, but was generally an enjoyable game.  ""was"".

I cannot say it's better.  I can say the early part of the game is way worse.  And at this point I don't want to invest more time to see how later stages of the game have changed.

Without going into details, my chief complaint is dying several times before even being able to skill up so I could create the basic necessities to survive the place is a bit of a joke.  I get that in the way it was before, crash landing on a planet with a pistol and 50 rounds and a portable constructor before was unbalanced, but landing with basically nothing for defense, nothing to use for crafting, and a weak multi-tool to gather resources (resources that you can't use anyway) is a big step backward.

It is for this reason that I rarely buy early access games anymore, the game you thought you bought may no longer exist a year or two later.",1535924123,1673910799,True,1,0,0.52702707052230835,0,True,False,False

These scenarios suck - we don't want to do stupid fetch missions with the physics of a PS1 game. There are FREE assets on the Unity store that are FAR better than anything in this game. Everything in this game feels like a cheap mobile game, but somehow worse. This is just embarassing.

 I would love for the Devs to respond and justify why they have been doing the SAME THING over and over all this time. Seriously, what is up with your obsession over redoing these weapon models? Y'all need to figure out when to throw in the towel.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

Original review
--------------------------------
I've had Empyrion since ALPHA. I come back every once in a while just to re-discover how BORING this game is.

Gathering materials is extremely boring. Movement feels like you are gliding everywhere. Flight physics are awful. Combat is hilariously bad - seriously it's like shooting enemies in a PS1 game. 

UI is AWFUL. Want to build a cool ship from your favorite show? You have the pieces you need, but good luck using the UI to get it done.

Every time I come back to this game, the devs have had to redo the starting mission, and how certain progression works because of how awful it is. They don't plan ahead. Instead, they waste time redoing the f***** graphics 20 different times in ALPHA while everybody screams ""MORE CONTENT AND BUG FIXES.""

It's good looking, and has great potential - but this game absolutely sucks. As a huge fan of survival games, this is one of the worst ones.",1668216811,1673890891,False,55,4,0.586585283279418945,0,True,False,False

I come back to a game that isnt really what I remember it.

The game's main gameplay mechanic/focus is around building things to solve problems. This new direction sees you playing a game thats more akin to no mans sky in some regards. Where you're progression is tied to exploration.

Now I have played a fair amount of no mans sky ever since the beginning and that game does it a LOT better. Why? because its focus ISNT the players ability to build huge custom made ships. it doesnt have the building mechanics of Empyrion so right now this game feels like more a mix and match of ideas.

The fact that progression relies on levels but then also just RNG of finding stuff in your travels is something not even no man's sky does and tbh I don't mind having high tier stuff do that but when its mid tier items or less that is just ridiculous and frustrating to say the least.

You literally now spend the first part of the game going through silly teleporters to get to planets so you can even make a ship that travels in space like what kinda wacky idea is this.

To top of it all off the story mission section is an absolute mess of weird checklists and weird conditions with objectives sometimes being so obscure like ""go to the icy planet""... like bro, they have names, YOU made the names. USE THEM. Lets also not go into the fact that the progression of the missions does NOT match the progression of your levels. You will be getting primitive crossbows as weapons when you're up to building LASER weapons. And then go up against like 15 drones in multipalyer that are using plasma cannons etc when you cannot even make them yet because you dont have the resource for it. Put simply the progression is ALL OVER THE PLACE.

Lastly they seem to have removed the entire procedural generation from the starter system. it now spawns EXACTLY the same EVERY TIME. So there goes all the joy for the majority of gameplay each time you start because you're gonna get hte same experience and the starter missions are TIED to this area so if you plan to do them then its literally the same thing every damn time.

Put procedural missions at the forefront. USE THE PROCEDURAL GENERATION. Stop trying to turn this into a half baked cluster of different ideas.

If you want it. Honestly after this change in direction for the game all I can say is wait for a big sale or just dont bother buying it. Sadly, now... you're better off waiting for space engineers to finish their NPC's and play that instead :(",1603726407,1673789482,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tutorials and missions are accessed from a very terrible ""PDA"" menu.  In fact, just about everything you need to progress is buried in terrible menus.

Tutorials are extremely basic and appear broken, they just end and leave you stranded.

I tried modding, I tried multiplayer, just everything is super grindy and slow paced.  Every other planet feels the same.  Same points of interest, same ground combat, space combat is super basic and feels like it's trying to be Space Engineers, but ships don't have physics when they break apart.

Graphics are *really freaking weird*, and you can actually see some examples in the cherry picked store page screenshots.  The assets don't match.  Aliens feel out of place.  It's like a ton of Unity assets thrown together, this is especially apparent as you explore other planets.

This assumes you can reach other planets.  The tutorials take forever to get you into a basic ship, and you have to grind for fuels (plural!) and ammo...

Speaking of planets, you just fly between small orbs in one instance (which are literally 2 to 3 miles apart from each other, for some reason in space they scaled distance to your player and made everything tiny), then when you touch them you're teleported to a different instance that looks like the planet you touched, but on a 2D plane.  They're not truly seamless 3D objects like in Space Engineers.

Lastly, on foot combat is really weird.  Feels like a 90s FPS.  Character doesn't move well and weapons are super basic.",1463324612,1673575646,False,0,0,0,3,True,False,False

You spend hours, days collecting enough resources for a Capital Vessel which will allow you to space travel to other Solar Systems, you then have to wait anywhere from 4 - 17 real hours for the ship to build (depending on size) and then deploy it.

You spend hours, days, weeks fitting your ship out and filling it with food and ammo, everything you need for extended space travel and then finally that day when you can jump to another system comes, it is quite exciting feeling like your an explorer and jumping through Space and checking out new Galaxies and Planets.

However you arrive at a new system with noticeable threats in the area, you get engrossed in collecting resources or modifying your ship some more and fail to notice the approaching Battleship, Destroyer, Transport etc and are only made aware when you hear your ship being torn apart by the enemy Vessel.

Torn apart is right you sit and watch as your ship falls apart like a piece of Ikea furniture and if your lucky enough to get away you have the massive, laborious task of repairing your ship, you finally get on your way again, life happens, you look away from the screen for a couple of moments and the same scenario repeats itself again, maybe this time the entire ship gets destroyed, then the enemy Vessel kills you, your Galaxies away from your home planet and now all that time you spent collecting, building and setting up is gone, gone and you have nothing, starting essentially again.

Your ships have no structural integrity at all, like i said they will fall apart like a piece of cheap Ikea furniture at the slightest provocation, even if you manage to float over to an enemy vessel, destroy the door or a wall with a weapon and get inside your find the enemy vessel is essentially a cardboard cutout floating in space, you can get inside at which point the vessel will start rotating around you rather fast, your find it very hard to move from your spot and most things like containers and the like that are inside, you cannot interact with.

You cannot overtake enemy ships or bases as they are referred to as ""Rechargeable Bases"" unless you edit the game files, i have edited every file both single and multiplayer and it simply will not work, you manage to take down an enemy ship or base and you cannot over take it and make it yours, everything is so temporary nothing feels permanent.

Like a cross between Ark, NMS and Space Engineers. Best parts of all 3. Steep learning curve but otherwise a lot to do :) But 500+ hours in there are a lot of issues...

One BIG problem.... The repair mechanic doesnt work. You can make a ship or use a template and even after saving the template again, itll show no backup, or the repair bay will fit your ship some times and not others. Ive now had to make 3 CVs because I cannot repair the ones I had. I tried contacting support but it doesnt help since the email bounces back every time. 

The vanilla game is very limited and doesnt take long to get bored of. Reforged mod (Made by a 3rd party) is a lot better. This is the main problem... The fan base of the game are amazing, in fact they contribute a lot more to the actual game than the devs do. It feels a lot like the main roots of the game are just ignored by devs, as if theyre just happy to let it continue to be stale or let the fanbase do the work until the game dies.

TL;DR: It's worth every cent, and I do recommend this game, but I have to do so with some caveats:

Survival: There are few moments in any survival game I've yet played that are more exciting than building a working Capital Vessel (CV) for the first time and leaving the bounds of your starting system.  That breakthrough moment when all the grinding comes to fruition.  If your motto (like mine) is ""less grinding, more fun"", this may be a tough one for you.  With that said, even someone like me was able to push through because it's so worth it!  It's got all the standards of mining, crafting, and building, but with oxygen and radiation mechanics.  Status effects are bad news if you're not ready.

Creative Mode: This is not OC, but someone in the reviews called this game ""Space Legos"", that was enough to convince me to buy it.  And it is!  It's amazingly satisfying to build a beautiful (and functional!) ship with no constraints.  You can really learn a lot about the game this way.  This mode has some helpful tools to aid in building more quickly, so the creative mode itself isn't ""grindy"".

The workshop is a huge plus of this game for sure!  For example: I can really no longer play the game without the Reforged Eden (RE) scenario mod.  It significantly improves the game, and I would almost consider withholding my recommendation if it were not for RE, it makes it harder, and admittedly ""grindier"", but so much better.

Pros:
- I'll put this upfront in pros because it's a big deal: the Dev team is working hard to actually improve this game.
- Great concept, Space Legos rock.
- Great immersion in an interesting universe
- interesting mechanics like thrust, mass balancing, POI traps, etc.
- Great dynamics between types of vehicles, example: the Capitol Vessel (CV) is great in space combat, but you really need Hover vessels/tanks (HV) for serious ground assaults.
- Huge bank of workshop files that integrate well.

Cons:
- Biggest con in my play style is this: ***allies cannot move about the ship while in motion!***  That's almost a deal breaker, and the single reason I haven't played in months.  It's painfully boring to just sit while the pilot drives.  It's a waste of almost everyone's time.
- The jumping mechanics/physics are ""slidy"", as in it's really hard to make certain jumps that should be easy, and would be easy in any other game.
- The game is really ""grindy"".  A reviewer wrote that the word that basically sums up this game is ""storage"".  To a large degree that is true.

Oddities:
- NPCs basically all move and act wonky.  The AI is shoddy, like, it's really garbage.  However, the AI will still kill your ass if you're not prepared.
- There are literally political spheres.  The area controlled by each faction is literally sphere-shaped.  That's not well-done.  Each system should be able to have a political affiliation, then the political boundaries should follow that.  It would even allow for a take-over of a system.

Overall, it's a well-conceived game that is enjoyable for hours upon hours if you're playing alone or in PVP.  It's a long shot, or at least requires adaption to play co-op.  Nice visuals, especially black holes.  The AI is wonky, but challenging enough to provide a great ride and a flexible adventure for multiple play styles.

Update: I've had the game for almost twice as many hours now,and I'm really enjoying improving my builds.  It's incredibly fun to be able to to build an infinite number of variations and let your imagination run wild.  There's a small but rich community of builders making some fine stuff.  Really creative stuff.  Still slide-y physics, but I still recommend.",1623431525,1672798925,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

Some reason they keep on changing the release date so that can be misleading..
per STEAMCHARTS this game actually came out on steam JULY 2015
do not be fooled its been here for 7 years not 2 as they posted the ""release date""

UPDATE:

Here's why I had to change my review:

So I seen one my friends playing this game for a while. I had to give it another try.
Now I'm not going to lie it still has issues with clipping and dumb AI.
But.. 
It has many things like Space Engineers but more. This game has interactive npc.
Blue print ship designs.
A universe to explore.
The graphics are still kind of rough for its age.
I would recommend getting it on sale around $20 bucks or less. Then its worth it.

I would say before with the bugs , the rough graphics, and it was hard to figure out that's why I didn't reallly give it enough of a trial. I'm glad I came back to this game!

OVERALL:

7/10 I can recommend this game at a discounted price of $20 dollars USD or BELOW

 because is 2020 and it looks like it's made in 2013 or something. 
I think the use of an old engine was a bad idea. AT the state of this game you'll still have some bugs here and there but I have spent a whole day just traveling , buying things from stations , and selling them.
I even got my mining lasers blown off my ship when my shields went down fighting a npc ship while questing and looking for pirates to kill. It was easy to repair my ship. Just find a station that does have the reputation and you can ""repair to template"". Which is a full repair.

Empyrion does not have the hi-res graphics or player models that Starfield will likely have, but I would rather have the incredible depth of Empyrion. The huge galaxy filled with stars, planets, moons, asteroid fields, many factions/empires to interact with has kept me playing for thousands of hours and more to come.",1672428835,1672428835,True,1,0,0.505208373069763184,0,True,False,False

All Epic Games cares about is Money China has money, so if China asks for customer information, Epic hands it over for cash. To verify that the anti-cheat sends data, start Empyrion to turn off all anti-cheat. Unplug from the internet if you so desire, then enter or start a new game; hit the tilde key (key below escape key qwerty keyboard) to see all that trying to connect every few seconds and failing.
That is your information being sent to the Epic Games server. But even though it is saying it is failing to connect, you need to ask yourself, is it always constantly failing? Whom do you trust? Your information is no longer secure on Empyrion.

**Update after over 2300 hours in game**
I held the Developers of Empyrion in high regard until they “IMHO” Moved the game from early access (even though it was nowhere near ready) so that they could release it on the arbitrary date they picked. Ever since the game left early access, multiple bugs have been reported, no communication between developers and the community. They have intentionally introduced numerous QOL issues that they seem to be ok with keeping, but the community is not.
To sum it all up, the view most have is that the game was forced out of early access only so the developer can move on to other projects with no intention of even attempting to make a functioning game as they first advertised. I would now recommend that you be cautious when you think of purchasing this game or any other from the developer.


Yes the 9.0 update is rough but as always the developers do listen they fix the most critical items first then tweak and balance. some want instant gratification for a game not even released. it is like going to a mom and pop eatery and expecting a Michellin 3 star experiance, just will not happen.
but yet as with everything nowadays if you cannot get your way now this moment some would rather down vote instead of showing patients and maturity.
if it is released in a bad state in your opinion then by all means down vote it.

It fails in game tutorial videos it seems. I have not played this in multiplayer. I assume that EAC is configured to fail on steam deck but I have never tried that in the latest updates.
Despite that:
Empyrion is like a cross between planet nomads and planet explorers and a bit like Fortresscraft Evolved and No Man's Sky.
Unlike planet nomads you can fly of the planet into other solar systems.
Unlike planet nomads and planet explorers (I think), you can play with others PvE or PvP (haven't tested that).
There is a story like system. You can share stories if you like that.
But anyway: it is an easy build your own vehicle space exploration game with RPG possibilities. You grind for resources by mining, stealing from others, salvaging or trade. Some resources can only be traded.
To make everything possible, you either build your own ship, or you download a design from the workshop (which is overloaded with designs). You can also download stories from the workshop or ""rewrites"" from the vanilla settings.
I am still at vanilla, I am only at my second solar system, I already wasted a lot of time, and it was a good time.
So be warned: The game does not function 100% on the steam deck, and that is mostly seen in not having videos in the help screen or in certain in game elements (you look into a computer and some have videos). I've never missed them actually. I think EAC also does not work, but you can disable it EAC on your server. I haven't tried any multiplayer things.
Single player it reacts very well to suspend on the steam deck.

An account of my first Empyrion playthrough (it was modded with the main mod people use).

Crashed on a planet. Salvaged steel. Dug up an antenna. Talked to a robot. Walked to a ship. died to a drone. Respawned. Picked up my pack. Died to a drone. Respawned. Picked up my pack. Died to a drone. Respawned. Snuck to my pack. Died to a drone. Respawned. Snuck to my pack. Died to a drone. Respawned in a new drop pod. ignored my old pack. unlocked some tech. died to a drone. New drop pod. Guided it to a iron deposit. found a spider nest. Died to a drone.  Respawned at some 'safe portals'. They were far away from all the map markings. began walking back to the tutorial section. Died to a drone..

THEN I LEARNED!!!

Thought to myself. ""Hey, this antenna spot is suppose to be pretty safe. maybe I should just stick here for a bit"". Researched some tech. learned how to make food items. sat at 3 food while waiting for energy bars to be made. learned how to refine items. Made some refined items. Unlocked some more stuff. Constant need for plant fiber. Constant near starvation. Got hypothermia. used the atmosphere thingy. tried to put wood in it for fuel. Didn't work. Tried plant fiber. Didn't work. Tried mushrooms. Didn't work. Found biofuel tank. Made that. put it in the machine. I didn't warm up. thought maybe I need to pick it up for it to work. Picked it up. Lost the biofuel.

under 10 food. Running out of plant fiber. Made an assault rifle. Made some assault rifle ammo. Shot some dinosaurs. Missed? Finally managed to kill one. Took the 2 steaks back to my constructor. 3% food left. Cooked steaks. 2%.... THEY ARE DONE. ATE THE STEAKS. I survived!

Voxel-based survival crafting games are still immensely popular, even eight years on from the release of Minecraft; the spiritual leader of the genre. Four years later came a pretty cool space-themed sandbox game known as Space Engineers. If these two titles had epic romance, you’d end up with ‘Empyrion – Galactic Survival’.

Let’s not get hung up on where the inspiration for Empyrion came from, because it’s an awesome game with a heap of unique ideas. Empyrion starts with an escape pod crash landing on an alien planet. When you exit said pod, your only real goal is to survive. Once you’ve mastered the basics, you’ll want to set your sites on distant planets – all of which have different atmospheres and gravity levels; not to mention (potentially) hostile NPCs.

Survival in Empyrion constitutes finding food, maintaining oxygen levels in your suit, and not getting eaten by space aliens – the latter of which becomes more of a threat as each day goes by. Whether you choose to build a hut, or a high-tech armoured fortress, you’ll be getting attacked by drones daily. This means that the player needs to get familiar with base defence systems such as turrets and hand-held weaponry – including .50 call pistols and laser rifles.

One of the great features of Empyrion, is its base building. Unlike Space Engineers, you needn’t build a host of tubes and wires to make a base functional – if a turret, storage crate, constructor, etc. is connected to the base, it’ll work. It takes out the painful logistical nightmare of base building, and makes it rewarding to design and build structures in the game.

Living out your days on this new alien land isn’t the only objective in Empyrion. The questing system is simple, allowing the player to set objectives which receive reward upon completion. This can help players to get a grip on the game, but the fleshed-out tutorial already has the basics covered.

It’s also worth mentioning the faction system. In Empyrion, you can create and join factions in-game; which works particularly well for multiplayer. Once you create a base or a space vessel, you can set it to be accessible by your faction only – that is if you don’t want to make it private. This is cool because it means that only you or your faction can use and edit the entity. It also means that rival gangs can’t get into your base or capital starship.

Empyrion boasts 3 types of space craft, which you can make entirely from scratch using a building block system. The hover vessel is a land-crawling beast that can be a damage-dealing tank or a utility vehicle. The small vessel can be used as a fast-moving recon vehicle, or a star-fighter. Capital vessels are hulking great movable bases – carrying all the essentials and a whole host of brutal firepower. How you choose to build a ship is entirely up to you, but the planets you intend to visit; and the purpose of said trip, will influence how you kit each craft out.

Graphically speaking, Empyrion is a bit of an odd one. At times, the rays of sun coming up over the peaks of Akua look stunning; yet up-close some of the textures appear to be a little dull. The texture tool allows the player to turn concrete into marble, tiles or even metal grills – but even these textures look lacklustre. The game could do with a little more cohesion when it comes to graphical style, but this doesn’t detract from the overall and all-important fun factor.

Further to this graphical gripe, some of the games wildlife comes across as unimaginative. If you choose to start the game on Akua, you’ll be greeted by two types of dinosaur. Whilst there are other forms of wildlife, the devs choosing to use dinosaurs feels a tad cheesy. I mean, they created an alien world – they could have come up with anything when it comes to planetary fauna, yet here we have dinosaurs. This said, there are enough other species to detract from the dinosaurs – although don’t get me started on the ‘slimes’…

My main bone of contention with this game is the terraforming. To put it simply, it sucks. When you first land and begin to mine, you’ll have the tier 1 drill. This is the most basic drill in the game, with the tier 2 drill allowing you to ‘terraform’. We’ll use the term loosely, because it’s quite hard to get a grip on how it all works. You can flatten, fill and remove terrain. To be quite honest at times I couldn’t work out which one was which, as they all tend to leave the ground looking like a pitted mess. Mining is also a nightmare, as you will aim at one block, only to find the ground beneath your feet falls away.

Enough of the negatives though, because this game has buckets of the fun-factor, which I reckon is the most important thing of all – a game’s gotta have something to keep us coming back right? I’ve played over 24 hours of Empyrion and feel like I’m only scratching the surface of the content on offer. It’s a nicely fleshed-out game with tonnes to see and do.

I’m running Empyrion on a mid-range system running an i5 with a GTX 760 – it’s a few years old but runs new games surprisingly well. The game only occasionally stutters when entering and exiting the atmosphere of a planet, but otherwise Empyrion is smooth as a baby’s behind.

Overall, Empyrion does more than itch those space survival urges. It’s pretty difficult to begin with – even if you land on Akua; the ‘safest’ planet. The game offers a real challenge where you constantly must plan around potential hostile NPCs and environmental conditions. Yeah sometimes the graphics can look a little stock, but the open-endedness of Empyrion more than makes up for this.

Because of that the progression system isn't even remotely challenging or satisfying. It almost feels like the devs would immediately remove all of the survival mechanics if they hadn't put ""Survival"" in the title of the game on a whim. Devs, stop trying to compete with Space Engineers. This game will NEVER be on par with SE on the building side of things so PLEASE start focusing on survival. This game genuinely has an unprecedented amount of potential that no other games can even match. EVEN with new technologies Dual Universe and Starbase are jokes of games at this point. You have the foundation for an amazing survival game, just utilize it.

Bad animations, bad character models, overly generous loot distribution, meh shooting mechanics and floaty movement values make this game feel very underpolished and unsatisfying to play. This game was not ready to fully release in this state and I'm almost certain that this game will never receive the much needed polish that it deserves.

We are on Patch 1.8 and the devs haven't even acknowledged any of the above things... Unfortunately, I can't recommend this.

EDIT: OK with patch 1.9 they FINALLY made an attempt at reworking the animations and movement. It still needs a little more work to be perfect though. I think the diagonal sprint needs to let you sprint more towards a 45 degree angle and the lack of air control feels a little restrictive. But I'll give them props because it does not feel like ice skates anymore. The graphics are actually pretty decent I think they can leave them as is for now. I would like to see character models improved (they're REALLY bad.) I think the sounds and visuals for mining need to be remade to be more satisfying. There's an inexplicable feel to so much of the game that's just unsatisfying in general. It's just a ton of small things. Things just need to be snappier, more responsive, sound better, be more satisfying, look more interesting. I think reworking the UI and sounds would be a good start. Then there's still the issue with OP loot lying around everywhere. I'd at least want to see a slider or toggle or SOMETHING to adjust loot spawns, rarity, etc. The game admittedly still needs a lot of work. But if the devs stay focused on polish and the feel of the gameplay the game could eventually get into a good state. Fingers crossed.",1510975161,1670968413,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its similar to Space Engineers but less focued on building things with moving parts<that hardly work properly>, and more focused on exploration and crafting food/meds/weapons needed to survive. No complex cockpit controls as with Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen, theres no real collision damage so flying is easy. Flight is more similar to No Mans Sky where you take off, head up into orbit, and are pretty quickly in space<unlike 20 min atomsphere exits in SE> Theres several different biome types on any of the landable planets/moons, where you can look for raw minerals, explore abandoned underground facilities, or salvage crashed ships. The game has elements that remind of me things from Osiris, Avorion, and Interstellar Rift, but there are planets you can land on, npc factions you can interact with or fight with both via ship or on foot. Ship building is a mixture of Space Engineers and Dual Universe, where you put down a core and build off of that element. Graphics are similar, and probably a little better than SE. Overall, out of all the games mentioned above, it has the most things to do in it before running out of things to do.

There are mods to the game and to optional scenarios (RE for an example) that make game server updates and stability an issue.. every time a patch or game update comes along, it breaks servers and the owners have to rush to fix it. On line servers are wiped every 3-6 months due to game updates and this causes the game to be wiped and you restart AGAIN. The other issue is that servers run out of resources and go unstable or lock up sometimes causing a reload or hardware upgrade and many hours of saved play lost so you restart AGAIN.  I have played 14000 hrs almost exclusively this game and I have played MANY servers.. Almost every sever I have played has had issues where my player, my resources and all my progress has been lost. You spend many hours playing almost the point to where you can advance to next level (hardware upgrades) then the game gets wiped and you restart AGAIN. You never really advance in the game. Some servers provide online storage (virtual backpacks) where you can store your resources between wipes but those get deleted occasionally, EVEN with all this said, this is a great game but keep in mind you will get about 3- 6 months of game play before most servers go unstable or get wiped and reloaded. As long as you keep this in mind and don't mind starting over the game is great.


This is without a doubt the best (and only) game I play. It combines exploration, combat and engineering, building in one game. I'm more of an explorer than a shoot-em-up kind of guy so exploring is what I do. The graphics are absolutely beautiful. You can play a game by your self but I really enjoy playing the Eden scenario on line with others. You can design, test, fly, use and shoot everything you build. There is always something to explore and fun to be had. I enjoy the logistics in collecting everything you need and packing up for an adventure.  I'm an older guy and its hard to believe how much games have improved since I played first video game and the original ""Pong""  (two glowing sticks and a dot) on an arcade console in 1970!!!

Game has come a long way but after putting about 40 more hours into it, the game crashed and when I started again I was falling from the sky.  I survived that but now none of my tool belt slots will work.  I can' access any of my tools, the motorcycle (which was thankfully in my inventory) or weapons.  40 hours down the drain.  After this much time, you should not be having catastrophic crashed like this.
Can no longer recommend.

previous: I have to come back and keep re-writing this as I progress in the game and like it more and more.

This is the game people have been trying to make for a while now.  You can craft your buildings, spacestations, big ships, little ships, itty-bitty ships and anything else you can think of.

You get farming, cooking, hyperspace exploration, planets that have been designed to be fun, not just generated by some dumb algorithm.

The grind is a bit much.  I'm not talking about resource gathering, that's a grind, but in a fun way.  I'm talking about the processing and crafting of materials.  It takes forever.  You can set up multiple constructors, but manufacturing 500 of the higher level blocks is still a slog and I've spent a lot of time with the game running in the background just to complete tasks.

But don't let that stop you from buying this excellent game.  As with other grind/resource gathering games, the payoff is BIG.

There is nothing better than sitting in your capital ship that you designed, in the captain's quarters that you designed, looking out the portal at the new lava planet you've just warped to and making sure you have everything ready to fly down to the planet with your mining vehicle and explore.

This is one of those games you play and finally look up at the clock and say, ""oh no!"", because you have to work tomorrow.

After three game days of stumbling around the planet, trying to figure out what to do and where to build (and falling to my death through a mountain because the ground disappeared), I created a shelter with the blueprint factory. Well, then you have to craft doors and windows. So I spend all this time gathering the resources for some windows, put them in the crafter and wait. They finally get done. I go to install them on the base. They won't connect. 

Well, it's night time by then. I can't see anything since it's so dark and because you can't hold the flashlight AND place the windows at the same time, I sleep in the tent to pass the night. Eight hours later, I wake up. It's still dark! There's still like three hours of night left. What kind of game design is that? You sleep, night goes by, and you wake up in the morning. It's in every single game like this. Anyway, I'm not going to stand around doing nothing, so I spend resources and craft a portable work light. I go to set the worklight in my shelter so I can see what I'm doing. 

No. You can't place the worklight in your shelter. Why? Who knows?

Pretty soon, I've got some daylight. Again, I try to install the windows. They still won't connect to the base. Why? Oh, those are the wrong kind of windows.

I felt the game had a lot of incomplete or even unnecessary game mechanics (such as the tech tree), but overall I thought it had great potential. Unfortunately after playing through alpha 8 and 9, more incomplete or poorly balanced mechanics have been added. 

   The creative building aspect to the game is the main reason I bought Empyrion. Unfortunately there are a ton of things that get in the way of fully enjoying building in survival. Windows really need the tint removed so first person is more viable when night falls. Not all slopes have shapes to connect them at the corners. Also all ""devices"", including storage boxes for some reason, passively draw power from your ship or base. Let's not forget to mention that the health of a block is decided based on the shape. If you don't want to constantly replace your ships blocks, you need to use all cubes so your ship looks like a flying brick. Don't even get me started on how capital ship weapons can't fire when on a planet and not all ship types can dock with each other. What if I want a small vessel that can pick up a tank and transport it to a capital ship, and then dock my capital ship in a larger mothership? All these combined create for a very unsatisfying ship building experience.

   First person combat is also a huge part of this game, and I'm sad to say it's completely broken. All guns have recoil. This means when you fire a gun the reticle, which is anchored to the center of the screen at all times, moves up to some degree and the screen shakes. Unlike other games, where the reticle jumps up independantly of the camera before settling back at the center of the screen, the reticle in Empyrion stays up. This means you have to constantly move the camera downwards as your fighting and is very tedious and frustrating. Not to mention that the camera shake is extremely exaggerated and needs to be toned down.

   Lastly comes the survival aspects of the game. It's the main focus of Empyrion. There are passive mobs, aggressive mobs, and mobs with guns that randomly take a knee while shooting you. Also there are capital ships that come after you when you arrive on more difficult planets, but because capital ship weapons can't fire in the atmosphere, some of their weapons are unable to fire and it creates a very strange situation where you feel like you cheesed the whole fight. Then when you want to claim your spoils of war, the ship is set to despawn in 15 minutes. Capital ships you meet in space are similar but despawn in 30 minutes and sometimes are unable to even be harvested for some reason. I heard this is both a feature and a bug. I'm not sure which to believe.

   Overall I feel like the time I invested in Empyrion was wasted. I have almost 1000 hours played, the vast majority of which was farming materials and trying to balance form and function in my vehicles. Alpha 8 and 9 have made it very clear survival is the main focus of Empyrion: Galactic Survival. This means the simplistic ship building aspect, the main reason I bought this game, feels incomplete and restrictive and many cool things I want to do, such as make a giant land carrier like in Sands of Kharak, isn't even possible.",1549199162,1670628473,False,90,3,0.655715465545654297,11,True,False,False

Since then, the galactic map has been quietly taken off the roadmap, then re-added and subsequently implemented, and the game is essentially complete.

So what is it like now?

Well, if you've ever heard of CURSED RUNES games, this is basically one of those, except it actually met all the design goals rather than get abandoned at some point. With my sweet gamer rig, it and Space Engineers are both about equally runnable, but, well, this game has a procedurally generated universe with planets you can land on, asteroid fields you can explore, capital ships, small ships, bases, pre-generated structures to raid and disassemble, different factions, wildlife, and generally an absurd amount of features, and all that comes at a cost.

It's jank as heck, there's no way around it.

Whether you're staring at the screen for ten seconds because you entered a planet's atmosphere and the surface is loading in, suffocating to death because you left a planet's atmosphere and forgot that your spaceship's cockpit isn't actually pressurized, realizing you don't know the button to turn your house on, or hosing down a slime-thing with bullets as it meanders uncaringly through the snow, or getting a popup asking you to send a crash report to the devs despite the game still running just fine, you will simply have to put up with how the whole thing is basically held together with duct tape.

But considering that this is halfway between No Man's Sky and Minecraft and has infinitely less money than either of them, that's impressive. If you can survive the jank, then you can look up at the night sky and see the wispy rings of the sapphire gas giant as your planet orbits through them, and you realize there's a real gem here because you can go to any of that.",1459999936,1670549233,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My biggest beef with this game is once you have turrets the danger is over. the Drone attacks are laughable at best. and in space once you defeat the drones/ships might as well get rid of all your defenses because they are not coming back. your completely safe. In order to find danger in this game you really have to go looking for it. I mean at the very least let the ships respawn or something. Or allow mods so people can create their own randomly generated surprise battles. challenging ships that will randomly spawn in system and hunt you down or a small drone fleets that will attack your station at random. Hover tanks planet side that pose a real challenge or threat to your base. otherwise all you really need is 2 flak turrets and you win... your now invincible. no need to increase defenses after that even on the hardest drone settings.

Change the file, they patch it and ruin your save file while re-introducing the damn spiders. No matter how many times you edit the file, you will have to do it again. 

They simply refuse to place a permanent Flora/Fauna selection checklist into the game that can be permanently set to keep these mac truck size demons out of your game, regardless of patches. 600+ hours, the first 250 or so was no issue, the game wasn't a dam spider simulator, they were few a far between, and thereby tolerable, but now they run in packs 20 strong no matter where you are, and I have had my fill. The game actually gave me hypertension from fretting about the dam things and I didn't even know it until it was too late.

I wanted to wait for DLC and maybe, just maybe a fauna/flora perma-selector, or at the least a portable mini-turret to combat that issue since I would not have to deal with them, but it is now obvious after years of playing that it will never happen, and so with a heavy heart I must put down the best game I have ever played...forever.

I mean this in the sense that it takes a bit of work to prepare, and then even longer to cook, but once it’s cooked, it’s great, and you get to enjoy it for days afterwards.

Empyrion is a survival game, where you have to survive on a planet with only the few supplies you had when you crashed. Building a basic base, you have to feed yourself, gather resources, and build something to get yourself off the planet. All the while trying not to anger the local wildlife too much.

It’s also probably a good idea that i mention that the developers on this game seem quite active, and had also let everyone play Empyrion for free all weekend.

As soon as you start a new game, you are in an escape pod, hurtling toward your new home. You can steer the escape pod only slightly. Immediately a hint pops up telling me to grab my supplies from my escape pod. Underwater i fumbled with unfamiliar controls, trying to access my gear. 

[i]Within my backpack was a basic constructor, which you can place wherever you’d like. At the constructor, you can add resources, which you will have to turn into basic components, which are then in turn made into the machines and blocks that you use to build your base.[/i]

This was about the point that i surveyed my surroundings, and realised that the graphics weren’t the best, but as with any good game, you eventually stop noticing. The tutorial was telling me how to build my base, and with time, lots of building, and about 7 different machines, i had a working base, with a brand new shiny “large constructor”, to make my base a fully functional home.

[h1]It looked terrible, it was a massive noob hub...[/h1]

...and to make matters worse, the machines were attacking each night. 

You only start with a small amount of magnesium, which you use to make ammo, and i had wasted it on less important enemies. Knowing that i had to find more, i decided to make a small craft, which i may have made the worst small craft that ever existed. I didn’t know anything about thrusters, so i ended up with a ship that could only go forward and turn. Despite this, i went … well... forward i guess, and after a short search, i found magnesium, mined as much as i could before the machines found me, then headed back to the base.

Get magnesium and make ammo. Ammo is the initial cost to get everything that you need to survive.

[h1]And if ammo was currency, i had some bills to pay.[/h1]

The important thing to take from all this is that Empyrion is an unfinished game, but a good one. I’ve still not made it off world, but the thought of trying to get there is exciting. The very idea that i can go into space and do everything wrong all over again with a different set of rules entices me to carry on. I have really enjoyed Empyrion, and will continue to do so, and i can only hope that other people will read this and try the game. Just don’t get disheartened, when it all seems too complicated.

Empyrion is great, and when it is finished, it will no doubt be greater.

Please consider this comment.

The most important problem is the ships that slow down when they cut off the gas as if there is friction in space. Fuel always accelerates you in space. In fact, when you reach a certain speed, you can cut the gas and travel without wasting fuel. I think this will take the game to a whole new level and increase sales.

Another problem is that the motion is not synchronized with the walking animation. When you take a step, it moves 3-4 meters. It's like the acceleration buff in Knight game. The road is flowing, the man just takes a few steps.

Each planet was varied in size, terrain, hazards, etc. As of writing there is a disappointing amount of re-use of the same lifeforms across the planets. But the terrain was very impressive with the variability and believability.  I definitely felt warm and fuzzy when I discovered that small, peaceful forest moon. Then again when I found a huge ocean planet. There I felt guilty after building an enormous base into the side of a mountain overlooking a tiny island - what an eyesore that was.

As someone who picked up Space Engineers the week it appeared on Steam and grew ever more bitter towards it as it failed to realize its potential, this is the game that I turned to and I don't regret it. Compared to Space Engineers, easily its closest competitor, Empyrion has actual survival mechanics, more building options, and actual reasons for including ""role play"" objects in your builds (you can sit on sofas, preserve food in fridges, and humorously, treat food poisoning with toilets). In exchange, it drops rotors, pistons, complex programming (though there is simple logic gating).

If you want a game with potential and a dedicated team that has probably bitten off more than they can ever chew, this is it. I hope it improves from here with larger playfields, more space stuff, and an improved flight and combat model, but it's a lot of fun now if you can come to grips with its limitations. I can't think of many games that let you explore the galaxy, land on a planet, deploy a tank, use it to disarm an alien base, and then storm the place with your trusty laser rifle—all in first-person, with survival mechanics, and using ships and vehicles that you built yourself!

In short, this game is overly ambitious, a hot mess of half-finished ideas, and infinitely more fun than its direct competitors. Pick it up on sale and see if it grabs you. If not, give it another couple of years; the devs will probably still be adding and improving things.",1669412007,1669412007,True,2,0,0.526527702808380127,0,True,False,False

To Start/Overview: This game is incredibly dynamic and is good for at least 100 hours play time, even if the core concepts of this game and optimization are not something you're interested in. This game is NOT a survival game. It would categorize more of a Building Simulator than survival. The survival aspects of this game are a joke and shame on Eleon for calling it Galactic ""Survival"". Even their attempt to make it more survival(god knows how many types of meds) is pathetic. Don't play this game if you're looking for a pure long term survival with no buildy build.

Positives: 

-This game has 2 modes, Easy mode and Reforged Eden. If you are casual and just want to blow up the world without worrying about all the technicalities - Play Vanilla, CPU and Volume(weight limits) off.

-Reforged Eden is hard mode. This ""mod"" created by Players; truly maximizes what the game has to offer. This is perfect for anyone who loves the intricate details of a game and uses that knowledge to create to best/most efficient ships/bases etc.

-Reforged Eden(Mod) caters to Obsessive Compulsive Perfectionists. If you are a passionate OCD otimization/Effeciency guru you could literally spend more time looking at numbers and preparing changes to your ship, than plaything this game if you chose. The math for Thrusts, Firepower, Defense, ship limits etc is inspiring.

-Klepto's dream: If you like running around collecting EVERYTHING you see, this game will consume your soul. Nearly every resource and trade item can be used in multiple recipes, and most recipes have stronger variants to build up to.

-In this game you have the ability to create any spaceship or base you could conceive of. There are 100s of different styles of building blocks with 1000s of variable shapes.

Negatives:

-The biggest negative about this game in my opinion is how hard it is to learn. Online resources may point you in the right direction, however many of them are out dated.

-The amount of bugs in this game after all this time is astounding. Fortunately there's a lot of built in support options for single player, and options for Server admin's to compete against them.

-If you're a survival game player (The Long Dark, Mists, The infected, or similar) This is not a survival game. The survival aspect of it only lasts for 1-2 hours - than it becomes a ""surthrival"". -Not a negative for most, But I was VERY disappointed in Empyrion Galactic ""Survival""s idea of ""survival"".

However, this game causes my PC to crash and reboot. It has happened over 50 times since I started playing the game. I already sent an e-mail to the devs including the memory dump files and game log files. No fix yet! Even though the game is fun and all, I dont recommend buying it. 4 years early access :P Are u kidding me? Wtf? I am sick of these crashes and early access in alpha stage for this looooong.

P.S. I dont experience the same problem with any other games I play (GTA V, Project Cars, PUBG, Dying Light, ETS 2, ATS, ARK Survival, Cattle and Crops, Far Cry series and many other games)

This game is extremely unfinished, however, and given its' age, I strongly suspect it now never will be.  So I only recommend it if you are someone who is willing to enjoy permanently unfinished games (similar also to Firefly or Stargate Universe in television terms) for what is already there, while recognising that there is no endgame.  You'll just stop playing it one day.

Empyrion is good, but ultimately frustrating.  It is similar to No Man's Sky in terms of the genre, 
and also in the sense that the scope of the game was too ambitious for its' development team, which means that it has half finished mechanics (the structural integrity and food systems) and broken progression, in the sense that the material you need for the starting crafting machine is only available on the starting planets, which in turn means that if you die on one of the remote planets and lose that crafting machine, you will need to start again.

The reason why I am ultimately quitting this game, however, is because it is far too difficult (and almost impossible in some cases) to obtain the minerals I need in order to build the more advanced ships.  Empyrion has support for multiple scenarios, but in the default scenario you can't mine the higher tier minerals at all; they are only available from salvaging the largest randomly generated shipwrecks, which don't spawn all that often.

The community is also on life support.  Given that I normally only play solo anyway, I can cope with semi-dead games in other genres; but there is enough depth here that you really want to be able to find information about things.  There are a couple of people on YouTube who are still making content for this game, but only a couple; and the wiki is really not in good condition either.  The Steam workshop also has a lot of content, but most of it is years old, and very few of the custom scenarios still work because the developers change things between versions.

That brings me to the fact that development for this game is now mainly being done via a custom scenario which is worked on by players, called Reforged Eden.  It's a decent scenario if you want action, but I mostly just want to mine and do my own thing, and unfortunately this game's players are obsessed with mineral resources being as rare as possible; I've seen players complaining that getting ore is too easy in the default scenario, which is absolutely insane to me.

If you're willing to play either the RE or Star Salvage custom campaigns from the Workshop, and also accept the fact that you will most likely never have the materials for a really big ship unless you build it in creative, then Empyrion is definitely worth playing; but after 150 hours, it's time for me to move on.",1668516248,1668516248,True,1,0,0.498659491539001465,0,True,False,False

The biggest issue being that if you are standing inside a vehicle and it moves, you will clip through it so raiding and PVP is practically pointless.

Needs some AI upgrades and combat needs some tweaking. Weapon tweaking is mainly in reference to ship mounted weapons being able to engage in specific environments. The AI movement and animations need updating and upgrading.

Otherwise is a very fun and highly potent combination of ground and space development. The ship building ability, whether it be in space or on the ground, is unprecedented in the community. I will always say that game does not need good graphics to be good and enjoyed for hours. If this game gets some much needed TLC, it could easily dwarf No Man's Sky and Space Engineers.

Well as you probably already know, it is a first-person shooter, role playing, open world survival, empire building space simulator with a focus on combat (in particular with the Zirax alien race). The concept is excellent, but this is not a finished game.

How good is the game? Best I can give it is 3 out of 5. At the time of writing this I have logged on 6000 hours on this game because I really like the concept but there are many bugs (besides the alien kind) in the game. For every feature, there is a bug that seems to go with it. Most bugs are just annoying and if you can get past that, this is a good game. 

Update: Back after a year, and while there were some minor updates... most are in scenery and am seeing the issues as below. 

Hotas Support: It does not have Hotas support, which I am a little dismayed at since they have removed what little work they did on it, where they had the throttle control functioning. While they said they would bring it back, it never did come back.  I use “joy to key” to help in using my hotas but it is a Band-Aid not a fix. Throttle is now only on or off with nothing in between and fine maneuvering I find still requires using the mouse and keyboard. It works, but it should be better.

Large universe: Lots of star systems and planets, which is great … until you jump into a system that has a glitch and won’t render. Then you need to hopefully find a GM so they can pull you out.

Solar Power: Bases can have solar power. It is great for bases to not have to mine resources to keep it running, especially space bases. However, on planets, the solar cuts out for no reason and can destroy plants and rot the food in your fridges. This is one of the things that are part of the out of sector not having the same rules as when you are in it as well as some ship power-up issues that effect how they work.

Building blocks: You can build ships and bases and other structures pretty much to your imagination. There are limited shapes, and skins for the blocks but with a little imagination you can make some nice structures … until you have to reset everything when it starts showing the wrong item. Panels are not steel blocks.

Walking inside ships: While you cannot walk around a ship that is in flight, you can while it is stationary which is a great feature … until the game glitches and you fall through the floor of your ship or the game crashes and when you relog into it you are free falling with your ship miles away. PS: Falling into a lava field is not a great experience but you can still survive if you have the skills. 

Sensors and signals: Automate doors, lights and other items in your base/ship add some realism … until the game glitches they fail and don’t work for unknown reasons (then start working on their own again). Sensors also work a little different when you are out of sector (or rendering range) than when you are in it. 

The list continues of features and bugs that go with them. The bugs are rare for the most part of the game, but you feel it when you hit some, though most are just an annoyance. I find that they developers do fix the bugs that are critical, and they do fix the easy small tweaks as well, but the medium sized ones are not treated with much importance in my opinion. The same bugs reported years ago still exist such as solar energy. It has been an issue for some time now and while not a game breaker, it hurts having to replace large crops and food supplies when it turns everything off. 

I hope this helps you on your decision.",1635459367,1668378873,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The tutorial and the UI needs to be reworked imo. The crafting menu is all over the place along with whatever the factory was. Where is the prefab in the tutorial generated from lol. I think sub menus for items make sense and not having everything available all at once may be a better idea as it will make it less overwhelming. I got to build a core but I have no idea what it does, maybe I could build a basic hut first and then move on to core needing things later? 

And why all the windows and 1 block for the tutorial? 8 windows do not cover the initial prefab empty spaces, 1 block does nothing as well, and where was I supposed to place the stairs? Does it matter which way the windows are pointing?

This is game has lots of potential and year on year has seen some great improvements. Amazing graphics, lots to do and explore. NPC AI is good and the POIs are always a challenge. Most I cannot imagine doing solo. It is one of the best space multiplayer survival games on the market.  That said it is still one of the most frustrating games that you can play. There are still bugs which are years old that have a detrimental impact to the player. eg entering the atmosphere can sometimes eject you from your ship and cause a client crash; occasionally looting boxes to your ship will not work and the box your looting will display as empty. Lots of silly wee bugs which should have been eradicated by now. I know the dev team are working on them as they finally fixed the issue with Hail and fog killing you in your shelter. unfortunately every time they patch some bugs they introduce another couple. Some are very frustrating like being unable to repair to template or your ship freezing or the client crashing. This is a great game which sucks you in, but the more you play the more bugs you discover and the more frustrating the game becomes.

Some bugs you can just ignore as they pop up just occasionally but some you cant because they are present all the time. I stopped playing after a few hours because the game was just annoying me to the point where i though what the hell am i doing playing this pile of crap.  The main annoying bugs are constantly sticking to  entrance to my ship and falling through the terrain when climbing hills and mountains. These bugs are hard to ignore as they are constantly there and totally spoil any enjoyment you will have in the game. 

I would love to recommend this game but i just can`t.",1667462021,1667462021,False,9,0,0.51334303617477417,2,True,False,False

   Abruptly woken by the sharp piercing warning siren, stinging my ears with each pulse, leaving me panicked, shaken, and disoriented, as my heart pounded hard and fast on my aching ribs. I slowly looked up, squinting from the blazing sun, as rays of bright light burned through my visor, slicing into my eyes like white hot blades. I tried to raise my arm to offer a brief shade of relief but it felt weak, heavy, and painful. [b]***INCOMING TRANSMISSION***[/b], crackled a harsh robotic voice, as it reported my vitals:

   [b]***HEALTH STATUS: CRITICAL***[/b]
   [b]***FOOD LEVELS: CRITICAL***[/b]
   [b]***OXYGEN LEVEL: CRITICAL***[/b]

   My bones creaked like dry rusty hinges as I struggled to sit up, and my blurred vision slowly came into focus as I panned my view across a vast arid desert, the blistering heat causing ripples in the air above the baking hot sand. My escape pod came into view, smashed and smoking, with my emergency equipment scattered around it on the sandy floor beneath. From the heavy damage to my pod, it was clear the parachute failed to deploy and I had suffered a severe crash, but somehow I had just managed to survive... Just.

   Struggling for breath, I frantically scrambled through cracked and broken oxygen bottles until I came across one half buried in the sand. Dusting it off, I could see several dents but it remained intact so I quickly screwed it into the inlet valve as the reassuring sound of compressed gas rushed into my suit, quickly easing my panic. [b]***OXYGEN LEVEL: 25%***[/b], buzzed the damaged helmet speakers, as one of the alarms faded. It wasn't going to last long, but it should be long enough to get my atmospheric condenser constructed and online.

   I next reached for a health pack which I plugged straight into my suit, gaining immediate relief as the nanocyte particles rushed into my bloodstream and began repairing my battered and broken body. [b]***HEALTH STATUS: STABILIZED***[/b], sounded another update as the second alarm ceased. Huh, [i]'stabilized'[/i] I thought as I braved a mocking laugh, easy for you to say... Maybe to A.I. statistically I was, but I certainly didn't feel stable and I was going to need a lot more than basic aid, but one was all we got. The UCH may be well known to all of humanity for constructing the colossal Titan, but they were also well known to the staff for their not so colossal survival kit. One health pack each, and we were lucky to get that. Anything else you needed, you had to craft it yourself in the field with salvaged, mined, found, or looted resources.

   Now... I could probably stand without it, but if I wanted to free my ears from the irritating whining of that final alarm, I would need to find food fast. I fumbled around in my backpack and found a few of the finest, aged (spoiled), and exquisitely crafted energy bars, lovingly crushed under a heavy copper ingot (yes... I carry a copper ingot in my backpack... doesn't everyone?). I continued rummaging around and stumbled across a vintage 2451 bottle of H2O, and what a great year it was too, with its unmistakable signature notes of a stagnant swamp, a perfect pairing with my rancid bars. I exhaled a sigh of sarcastic satisfaction, [i]ahhh[/i]... a meal fit for a king.

   I topped up the water tank on my suit, put the energy bars in the liquefier, turned it on, and listened as it blended the bars and water to create a mouthwatering, three Michelin star paste, which I hesitantly sucked up through the silver-service feeding hose in my helmet. Fine dining at its absolute best. But sarcasm aside, it provided a much needed burst of energy (soon to become a much needed burst in the bathroom), and freed my ringing ears from the last remaining siren. [b]***FOOD LEVELS: INCREASING***[/b], stuttered another update.

   The silence lasted only momentarily however, stepping aside as it was replaced with the environmental orchestra, now taking centre stage. A gentle breeze could be heard skimming across the amber dunes as it gracefully swept up fine clouds of sand over the sculpted crests. The soothing, tranquil sounds of countless insects as they sang together in hypnotic harmony... I felt my eyelids closing as I enjoyed a brief moment of calm...

   [b]***WARNING: TEMPERATURE CRITICAL ***[/b], barked loudly in my ears, knocking me out of my trance, and returning me to a complete state of panic. I rose to my feet, equipped my scanner, and sent out a pulse as local markers began to appear on my HUD. Readings of a crashed vessel resolved... it was in range, and I needed to get there fast.

   With a running limp, I made my way to the crash site, though advancing past my escape pod I spotted a large family of leafcutters, who also spotted me. Initially looking startled, they quickly turned hostile and began scuttling toward me, the unsettling snipping sounds of their razor-sharp mandibles getting louder and louder. They soon surrounded me and were closing in fast. But I just stood there...

Frozen...
Panicked...
Unable to move...

[b]My story above is a snippet from one of the many books I have recently started writing, adapted from my original, for my review of this game, and also adapted to loosely include familiar elements from the game (please see my profile page for a better explanation).[/b]

   To offer a more traditional review... I absolutely love this game and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with even the slightest interest in this genre of gaming. Despite my clear fondness of this game, I will remain completely honest and share that there are still some bugs, but it has been years since I have personally experienced anything even remotely game breaking, and the developers are constantly tweaking, updating, and improving the game.
   Now... Stop reading this review, get the game, find an amazing server, join an even more amazing community of players, browse the mindbogglingly awesome creations from the insanely talented artists on the workshop, and enjoy this game in whichever way suits you. Create your own adventure, and lastly...

383120,124631997,76561197987155388,0,13,13805,0,7267,1706929098,"This is what Space Engineers could be, but its crappy, buggy and heavy physics and lazy developers killed about (I have 2.267 hours of gameplay there. ALONE).

Empyrion lose some of the detailed building side of Space Engineers by simplify it (that isn't a bad thing, like: adios stupid and bulky conveyors) and introduce some building mechanics and technology more logic (like: ONE TYPE of thrusters and fuel, with only variuous size and power/capacity, you can create fuel from basic items (wood), SHIELDS), but it gains a lot on the gameplay side.

First, you have LIFE on planets and moons with prey and predators on ground and on the sky, you have environmental characteristics like fiery rain on hot desert planets, acid rain, storms, etc, and the big thing is that you have NPCs.
They're simple static NPC, some of them interactable (like traders and quest NPCs) and with only guards and aliens that are the ""mobile"" ones, but you're not alone out there. When you go inside buildings and ships, there are NPCs. Are you listening Keen Software?
And the main quest is interesting, I'm enjoying it.
Other than that, you have so many ""solar"" systems to visit with at least one planet and one moon each that you can't ever say that you have nothing to do. And if you do, just slide the galaxy map with the right mouse button and you'll see even more systems.

But ""it's not all roses and flowers"" like we say in italian, there are some flaws in the game.
First of all, no real side quests. Yes you have faction quest to increase reputation, but it increases automatically when you fight the main enemy and are a little annoying. So you don't really have all this desire to explore all systems.

Second one, the AI isn't so complex, sometimes you'll see animals/aliens/guards that stuck themselves or seems inactive. And like I said before, aside from animals/aliens/guards, other NPCs are just animated decorations with sometimes some static speech lines. In short, it's not Skyrim where you can interact with anyone and you feel almost alone.

Third one from ship mechanics, you have many useless restriction like small vessels have less options than hover vessels (mainly for the turrets) like capital vessels having some less options than bases (like Deconstructor and Furnace) and I don't like it. You will end by creating bases or hover vessels in creative mode and use the convert console command to gain those differences. Mainly because with a immense world and so many solar systems to visit, it's useless to have a fixed base somewhere and hover vessels can't go further than 3m from ground, and they can't handle terrains except flat ones. So you'll end build only a Capital Vessel as main mobile base and using small vessels to approach things and planets.

Also the main enemy turrets are OP and the bad thing is that you can't upgrade your shield. You'll have a single shield with 36k HP maximum (with the T2 one), you can't add any more HP or fast recharge or boosts or resistances like in the character armor. So you basically end with building ships that have more weapons than the entire American Army to destroy as fast as possible enemy ships. Armors are not indicated to tank, mainly because turrets targets enemy turrets + warp drives + generators + thrusters, so when you lose all your turrets the armor is useless. You'll need it but it's almost better use the turrets high HP to tank, being the first ones to be attacked.
In short, you can't tank. Also maximum speed is fixed so you can't avoid much. As I said, you'll end to build ships with 200 turrets to melt down rapidly enemy ships before the shield go down.
Or continue even if the ship is teared apart.

Now for the technical sector. Graphics and sounds.
I'm not demanding about graphics and I like the graphics on Empyrion, but objectively it seems a graphic of some years ago. Too much years ago.
Planets and stars are beautiful, ships are obviously ""cubic"" like in Space Engineers because of the building mechanic, but NPCs, animals and plants are visually a little too old.
I usually mute music in all games, but in space with few sounds I set it to low volume and it's acceptable.
Sounds aren't so good, and you have no voice at all with any NPCs, like an old 2D rpg.

Another thing is that there isn't collision damage (some said there is a little, but I don't think so. I forgot to fullfil the fuel tank of my ship once and I went away for some minutes. The capital ship lost power and went down and crashes to the ground from about 900m altitude, no damage at all).
I don't expect complex (and buggy) collision damage physics like Space Engineers, but a little could be enjoyable.

One good thing I forgot to mention is the survival side of the game. Aside from food and oxygen, there are many dangers for your character.
Spider bites can poison you, with 3 stages that if not cured (and if you manage to not die by restoring health in the meanwhile) it ends with permanent organ failure that do so much damage that you'll end dead if not threatened fast.
Aliens and animals can infect you with parasites that mostly drains health, stamina and increase hunger fast.
Then you have cold burns if you go on space without boosts on armor that protect from cold, hot burns from hostile environment and the vicinity of ship thrusters, fever, hangover, food poison, wounds (open then infected then necrosis and ends with permanent mulilations), fractures (closed and opened), radiations, all that evolves in other symptoms if not cured.
Yes you'll have 5 different medical stations to use for all those, and items and food to threat all this problems, but you'll always have at least 3 inventory slots used by aid items, plus one for oxygen and at least one for food (that perishes depending on the food type and food processing, aside from water and emergency rations).
I like this part, a lot.

Last one flaw is the poor support for mods, it's not like Skyrim or Space Engineers, you have only ships and hovering vessels blueprints. There is the Reforged Eden mod that I'll try soon, but other than that you can't have single mods like powerful shields or more powerful turrets.


In the end I'm liking this game, but I think it lacks the potential to be a great game. And with Starfield from Bethesda incoming (even if it won't have coop mode, BETHESDA FFS!) this game will sadly die soon.",1667100063,1667100377,True,9,0,0.570728659629821777,0,True,False,False

As a model building game (designing a nice looking ship or base) this might be of interest to those players overwhelmed by the complexity of Space Engineers.  However, as a survival game Empyrion falls short in many areas:
  * The core mechanics of the game grow boring after a short duration.  (Gathering materials is a major part of this game and the actions are not satisfying).
  * The craftable food has some variety, but most of it is in the graphic image of the item and not the stats that benefit the play. 
  * The AI is incredibly rudimentary and even buggy at times.
  * The single player NPC economy is not compelling as the NPCs offer very little of use for the money.
  * The multiplayer servers are only lightly populated (10 or fewer active players), so there is no relief there either.
Bottom line:  A player is left with few options to actually enjoy the gameplay beyond workshop creations.  An area which already has plenty of nice designs.",1667042644,1667042644,False,35,2,0.654137372970581055,0,True,False,False

The bad sides though, is this game is being developped so slowly, like continental drift slow. (Close to10 years in the making, and it still doesn't feel like a finished product.
The devs have very good idea, but are awful at coding and fixing the bugs this game has. You can still play it, but some bugs can ruin the game for you if you don't have the patience (in single player you'll eventually have to use console command to get you out of a game-breaking bug.)

When it doesn't bug, this game is solid 9/10, but because there is so much bugs, I cannot give it higher than 7/10. 
Good game, but you need to be REALLY patient & ready to learn the game by yourself (Youtube helps), or get into a multiplayer server and ask the people in global chat, most are very helpful and good players love helping new ones, but again, you need to ask for help, because the tutorials in this one aren't the best, and don't tell you everything.

There are a lot of crafting and ship building options as well as some farming, and lots of resource harvesting. The tech tree, while large seems a bit dull because the research is completed way before you can acquire the advanced resources to craft most of the top level stuff which takes quite a bit of grinding. The AI path finding is a bit off and NPC mobs get stuck on walls and other obstacles some times.

Empyrion is not the best FPS, nor is it the best survival game, nor the best space exploration game, nor (probably) the best spaceship building game, nor the best space combat game. But it is the only game that is all of those things. There is no goal save what you decide for yourself. For me, the aim is to acquire an obscenely large vessel. I prefer to make my own in creative mode, but for those not so inclined there are tens of thousands of player-made vessels available from the Steam workshop. Some of them are works of art that must have taken well over 100 hours to build, and some are so big you can get lost in them.

Criticisms of Empyrion are usually that it has too many long-standing bugs (true), should not have left early access (true), or that it does not do one of the things mentioned earlier well enough (e.g. FPS, survival). I say that the positives of the game easily outweigh these and any other negatives you can think of.

I will finish on a negative: I wish they would introduce some kind of balance depending on the number of players. I play single player only, and I have learned that it isn't worth engaging anything stronger than a drone in space because enemy vessels are too strong. They are balanced for multiplayer, and it not worth it for a solo player.",1666791633,1666791633,True,20,0,0.717509806156158447,3,True,False,False

the UI/UX is CATASTROFICALY BAD, everywhere you look it seems to show too much information to the point of being overwhelming, but at the same time it doesn't show vital information you would actually want, i can see the exact yaw, roll and pitch speed of a ship, but i can't see if my fridge is fucking working and if i will lost all my food from hours of farming

lets say you have a debuff, how do you know what it does and how to fix it? hovering the mouse over it? NOOO, THAT WOULD BE TOO INTUITIVE, how about you looking at the hundreds of colapsed pages of the codex and try to find that debuff(which you don't even know by name), then click on that page and read 30 or more lines of explanation of what is a debuff, how to navigate the codex, and then, how to fix. all that while the game isn't paused (even on singleplayer)


for the price, i simply can't reccomend, its glitchy, unnecessarily complex, the UI is annoying, and it feels empty, theres stuff to do, but i just feel like it isn't worth it",1666580248,1666581116,False,14,1,0.547849357128143311,0,True,False,False

It provides the freedom to forage, build bases and ships piece by piece, and create your own adventure. The game's visual style started a bit rough, but their art team have ""very"" slowly been making art passes to improve the quality of the game's graphics all over, including environments, armaments, and NPC assets. If this game isn't on your radar, put it on there, or straight up buy it. The game costs very little for the 1000+ hours i've put into the game. That's with no micro-transactions, and no subscription.

Я повелся на картинки и видосики в описании. Рефунд делать не буду, т.к. сам разработчик игр...
Кусок недоработанного говна уровня пре-альфа.
За два года уже можно допилить игру, разве не ?

Из плюсов:
1) Классный жанр и сеттинг
2) Неплохой рендер (ну из коробки юнити). Выглядит не поршиво по крайней мере - можно играть.
3) 3Д арт не плохой. 
4) Енвайронемент тоже вроде ок.

Из минусуов:
1) Звук - увольте к *уям вашего звуковика - или того кто делал звук.. А лучше дайте ему трындюлей сверху. Такие люди не должны находится в индустрии. 
2) UI - тоже можно ссаными тряпками гнать - уровень лабороторной работы в школе. Судя по всему UI артиста у них не было.
3) UX и гейм дизайн - это те, из-за которых ваша игра говно. За час игры где-то, я так и не смог построить самый первый ""портабл конструктор"" - который у меня в темплейтах. Дерево технологий никак не связанно с этими сраными теплейтами.

Hi taelyn
Saltore — Today at 8:08 PM
Hey taelyn,  Dont know why the big power trip with the new mod TSM but he muted me on discord so i cant reply to his comments and muted me ingame as well.  is a transcrip of my co
Here is a copy of  transcript of the conversation Saltore — Today at 7:51 PM
well, just so you know i am  recording all events  on this subject and will be taking actions against this power abuse
TSM — Today at 7:52 PM
server@empyriongame.com
Taelyn direct email
it was a polite request not to talk about a rival game on our servers , and you and your mate took it further
Saltore — Today at 7:55 PM
the fact that you muted me on discord and have not let me reply to your comment is unfair to say the least.
TSM — Today at 7:56 PM
you should of use DM's in first place we do not moderate in public you made it public
as far as i have seen before you seem a reasonable guy and like playing game
Saltore — Today at 7:57 PM
Do you think taelyn is going to side with you muting me ingame and in discord?
TSM — Today at 7:58 PM
you need to take that up with him.
Saltore — Today at 7:58 PM
i will for sure, and will forward all the video of chats
TSM — Today at 7:59 PM
i would use the email though as he lives in Finland and is asleep
Saltore — Today at 7:59 PM
and insted of muting me, you could of sent me a DM
i would of been interested in a discussion with you instead of just muting me
Saltore — Today at 8:58 PM
Here is all the chat from ingame and discord. I dont believe i was in the wrong and should of been muted and i do believe that was abuse of power, if you think otherwise please let me know.

I did not take the pics of the 2 server message , one was about Taelyn bot  warning about racism and the other was to state that i was muted for arguing with staff.
i did not argue with TSN ingame chat
Taelyn — Today at 9:05 PM
You do argue with him
You started a DM, this is arguing
When there is a problem you DO NEVER message the moderator
You message us
Saltore — Today at 9:05 PM
i did not DM TSM
Taelyn — Today at 9:06 PM
He has the right to block you if he does not want this, there is nothing iam going to do about that
Saltore — Today at 9:06 PM
Ok thanks for looking into this
Taelyn — Today at 9:06 PM
There is also another guy involved, i guess either you dragged him in it, or he involved his self in it
Saltore — Today at 9:06 PM
i am very disapointed
Taelyn — Today at 9:07 PM
I saw what he said, and this is simply not allowed
The server mute will end, you simply wait it out. Its a timeout that you simply need to walk away
Saltore — Today at 9:08 PM
Well taelyn, i gota say , i am not very happy at this moment, i dont know if you took the time to look at all the pictures i sent to you
Taelyn — Today at 9:08 PM
The message content i will read later, iam in the middle of a pvp battle
Saltore — Today at 9:08 PM
but, i hva enot DM your moder
Taelyn — Today at 9:10 PM
I will read the rest later, iam sorry but atm my game comes first
Saltore — Today at 9:11 PM
i have been with you for a long time now, i have requested the purchase to many of my friends and ppl ive meet. and cant say i agree with the way you handle this.  you should of looked at the evidence before siding with your moder, who i never DM
Taelyn — Today at 9:11 PM
Iam not siding with anyone

There is no excuse to still not have it and frankly that's the only reason I have not been touching this game in 2+ years and will not touch until they add this crucial bit of immersion.
Therefore I am speaking with my vote. 
Otherwise the game shows potential but falls flat in some of their design choices.  

Original Review:
--------------------------------------

TL;DR 
This is one of the few games I actually bought after ""trying it out"".
I give this solid 8/10 in its current state. Highest score I have given to any space simulator.
Is gud.
-----
[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
    [*] Massive world with actual content to explore!
    [*] There is a point to explore. I find loots I can't craft or is rare.
    [*] I died while exploring! It is not too easy. Enemies can be fearsome.
    [*] Can use templates. I don't have to craft everything myself.
    [*] Beautiful. I can stay and watch the sunset.
    [*] Survival. Need to care about food, heat, radiation.
    [*] Is fun with friends. Flying with a ship where one pilots and others gun.
    [*] Can build underground and create a vault.
    [*] Developers listen and update the game often.
[/list]

So it already is everything one could desire from a good base building game. 
But it is not perfect in everything...

[b]Cons:[/b]

    [*] One can't walk inside a moving vessel, has to sit. (this alone is a whole -1 to the total score)
    [*] Capital ships can't use their main weapons in atmosphere for some strange reason. This is easily circumvented though with a hover craft docked on a capital.
    [*] Plant spots too space consuming and clumsy.
    [*] Blocks can be space limiting at times and look clumsy.
    [*] I don't see many healthy servers running. Biggest has 110 players online though.
    [*] AI and animation requires more work. They are not too bad though.
    [*] No collision damage. Fall damage is there at least. Broke my leg.
    [*] No game engine modding? Only blueprints. Can't add my own blocks.
    [*] Game has no force shields. (I love shields)
    [*] Game has no grenades.  (I love grenades, explosive planting not the same)
    [*] Can't add colonists in Terraria style to my buildings and populate the world.
    [*] Lonely to play alone without friends or other players online or on same planet.
    [*] Some lasers look clumsy and too big for their effect. I expected to die one shot when a house sized laser hit me. Nope. Lost half of my hovercraft though.
    [*] Turning a block can sometimes be more confusing than what it should be.
    [*] Can't make my own river/lake/lava lake/forest/moat or terraform areas of planet.
    [*] Can't place small vessel blocks in base. Restricted to big ugly blocks.

So it has its flaws and has something left to be desired for but as it stands this game succeeds very well in areas where a lot of other space games have failed.
This is my first actual review to any game in steam.
I bought it for 20 euros, did no want to wait for a sale.

The Good: The graphics in Empyrion are stunning and I didn’t encounter any major game play issues while playing. There is plenty to do to between exploring and gathering resources in order to make life more convenient with the ultimate goal of leaving the planet you’ve been stranded on.

The Bad: I did experience some graphical glitches when playing, primarily screen tearing when mining underground, and although it was annoying it didn’t impact play.

Combat is boring and very basic, reminiscent of old first person shooter games, and the enemy AI is limited and predictable. But the worst part of Empyrion is the resource grind. Just hours and hours of mindless gathering with what appears to be no end in sight. All your effort wasted only to find that you are short on materials to make some other component of what you are ultimately trying to craft.

The crafting system is robust, but convoluted and confusing. Even after starting fresh a couple of times and spending hours running around gathering material to try and craft small objects I just found it frustrating. 

My Take: I had high hopes for Empyrion but frankly I found it got boring very fast. Couple this with the unintuitive crafting system and lack luster combat, there was little to keep my interest and it just became a tedious grind with pretty scenery.

My Advice: If you are looking for something to do that is chill with good visuals and have the patience of Job to figure out the crafting then this game maybe for you. I highly suggest using a game controller if you have one. It may make play a bit easier.",1664798833,1664798967,False,5,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Brilliant cross between Space Exploration, Survival Horror, Builder/Crafter and FPS.
Game keeps improving with time, although there is still the odd amusing bug.
Graphics are smooth and beautiful for space and planets, some vistas are simply stunning, graphics are a little dated for aliens/people, but feels a little retro because of that. :)
Many cool designs for ships, hovercraft, massive ships, bases and space stations available on the Steam workshop... or build your own.
1000 hours in and still loving it.
If you love Space, Survival, and Crafting/Building: buy this game.
Advice: When starting out, join a server or start a single player game with Weight/Volume and CPU Constraints turned OFF, unless you like really steep learning curves. ;)
With Weight/Volume and CPU turned on Empryion becomes a far harsher, less forgiving, and more challenging game where balance and trade-offs in equipment, power, weapons and shield all become critical... You may want to learn the ropes first.

Highly recommend, but expect the odd bug. ;)

Empyrion fails in every way to compete with No Man's Sky, while you can build your own ships, it's very apparent that's all Empyrion has over NMS. Everything else, NMS beats Empyrion. The variety of vehicles in NMS certainly glosses over this as well, you can have a modular mech in NMS. How can this beat that in ANY way? NMS has nearly every feature that Empyrion has and it's 100% more polished. Sure, NMS has it's bugs and issues, but it is so much more polished and feels more like a complete game. Every update in NMS gives so much new content, while this game struggles to stay afloat with minor fixes and changes. I mean, WooHoo! you can now change the color of your engines and displays! But, NMS has a complete story and well developed NPC quests and Empyrion's system is still just a shell. I can just never see a reason to return to this game.

Later edit: The game just feels like an empty shell. Nothing feels alive, it's technically interesting when it comes to building. But everything just feels like a shell of what it's meant to be. Every system is a little less than mediocre. This is a failed game in every design from the ship building where you cannot walk around during flight, to AI combat where it feels like playing against aimbots. From the graphics to the physics, everything in this game is subpar.

1.0 review. I don't even need to open the game to know that nothing has changed from Alpha (according to the devs) to Release. For me, there is no difference between abandoning development and releasing a game to 1.0 before it's feature complete. There are just too many issues with this game. The core game is great, but the surface is ugly. The graphics, animations, writing and many other things are bad. It makes you want to love the game, but you just can't do to everything that makes similar games better.

This game is a core good idea without a lick of polish. There is nothing good about this game, just a lot of mediocre to badly implemented features.

My hours are due to coming back to this game over and over again for many years. Everytime I've left disappointed and hope that the next big change makes the game feel better. However, I always leave before accomplishing much feeling that the devs never cared about polishing the game. They are happy with a mediocre product and this release shows that is a fact.

May 2020 Edit 2: I tried so hard to enjoy this game but the devs just seem like they want to punish people for playing single player mode. No warning of the difficulty level a mission might be. Long dialogues that you can literally die in the middle of.

1st example: The Talon story mission has you find someone in a prison. However, once you unlock the prison there is a wall of text, before I was finished reading the text there was an explosion and I died. I reopen the log and the very last thing in the long dialogue was a message telling me to hurry the place was rigged to explode after a stupidly long wall of text. This is just really bad game design, at least have some kind of audible timer.

2nd example: The game gets you to build your first SV and head to the moon to find a derelict vessel. Its a fairly peaceful exploration mission reading stupidly long logs of text that if you close you have to start over and if you wait you start to suffer from hypothermia (in heavy armor with multiple boosters). Until the very last console where there is a surprise attack by over 20 drones all at the same time directly targeting you. If they can't see you, they go straight for your closest vehicle and instantly destroy it. There was no indication up to this point that this was going to happen and during this time you are supposed to travel over a mile to a base out in the open.

I know this is very rage quitty, but I tried to accept that I died, but immediately after I respawned my base was attacked by 4 rocket drones that completely annihilated it. I had an EPIC rocket launcher and multiple turrets guarding my base, but they were able to destroy my turrets before they could target them.

This is all on EASY difficulty BTW.

May 2020 Edit: Trying this game out again, seem like they've made quite a few positive changes, including adding a galaxy map, shields, etc (somethings that I've previously requested). The progress on this game is dreadfully slow. It has been in development for 5 years and I feel like they are no where near finished. Comparing this game to something like Subnautica (another indie project that started around the same time) which started EA in 2014, the difference in quality is leaps and bounds. This game really needs some flavor to it and they need to add in a proper story with a computer voiced AI. I know that this is a much bigger game than Subnautica (with multiplayer, space travel, and more detailed building and physics) but they are already far in development of their second title. I'd just love to see some strong progress to improving things like the graphics and story.

However, I am going to change my recommendation to a yes, but hesitantly. This is one of the few EA titles (Factorio and Satisfactory being some others) that I really want to be successful and I've played and enjoyed it quite a bit, only quitting due to sheer boredom and having to deal with bugs.

My biggest request for this game would be to add more detailed configuration menu when starting a game, instead of Off, Easy, Hard or Low, Medium, High, give us some sliders like other similar survival games.

Apr 2019 Edit 2: My brother and I have been trying to use this game in coop mode and it seems to crash every hour or so. I am hosting and either the server crashes, my game crashes or my pc crashes. I haven't had any crashes outside of Coop. I recently setup a dedicated server on a separate PC in my house and we'll see if that makes much of a difference. I will say that setting up a server and transferring your coop save world is pretty easy.

Apr 2019 Edit 1: This game is still riddled with bugs and stupid high difficulty for solo players. I had the game on easy and my weapon vanished just as I was attacked by drones with missile launchers. They destroyed about 2 hours worth of work in a few minutes because of a game breaking bug and there is no recovering. The difficulty balance in this game is crap, you die from just a few shots even on the easy difficulty. This is not for solo players unless you are extremely patient. The grind is just too much.

I really want to like this game, but its so bland at the moment. The idea of building your own spaceships and flying to other planets is great. 

Somethings that would really improve this game for me:
More focus on space exploration and discovery. I know there are ""achievements"" missions, but its just a check list. I want to DISCOVER things for myself.

I also wish the mobs and buildings on the first planet weren't so OP. I spend hours gathering resources only to have the ship that took an hour to build in a factory destroyed in less than 30 seconds by rapidfire long range laser turrets.

Regenerating Shields are a must, the ability to take one or two hits without being utterly destroyed would be awesome.

Even on the lowest difficulty, bad guys are stupid powerful and it takes forever to build ships in factories (many, many hours) And, its impossible to change this, even in a single player game.",1535580334,1664457600,False,0,0,0.494130313396453857,0,True,False,False

Very imbalanced. There's almost no rhyme or reason why things cost what they cost, what the foods do, etc. CPU limits and weight/volume limits can be toggled off and should be, because they don't make much sense either.

Ships you destroy in a fight despawn either instantly or after a 5 minute delay. The developer has made it clear that this is to save resources and won't listen to anyone proposing solutions like, you know, despawning them when the player leaves the area. It won't be changed. It's rare to see someone taking out a good chunk of their content/gameplay for no good reason.

The base game becomes awfully boring after just a little while. The factions are unimaginative, the space fights pointless. 
There is a large ""reforged eden"" mod that will fix that, but it doesn't have updates like carbon substrate (plastic, a cheap base resource) being available, so starting out is not just rough, it's a pointless grind.

Reviewing this game is hard. I've never played Vanilla. Theres multiple scenarios from the community and only ever played Reforged Eden. Speaking to vets (over 5k hours); this game should of died years ago and without RE (Reforged Eden) it would of become boring so much quicker.

Reforged Eden combines two player scenarios and add loads of content to the game. However not enough that i wasn't done within 2 weeks while still learning the game mechanics etc.

[h1] Bugs, issues and more BUGS [/h1]
This game is over 10 years old and is only on version 1.8 from an Indy developer? and this really shows in the game play.
There's multiple issues such as:
[list]
[*] UI Locking up the game, If you have loads of Blueprints, searching(Only place you can search... WHY?) will freeze the whole game.
[*] 0 FPS on a 3080Ti and even a 3090Ti - while in space battles. RE has done their best to mitigate this by limiting weapon groups a single vessel can have, so god help anyone playing vanilla. This has caused numerous ships to be lost. 
[*] Desync's, you can fight a ship have to duck out due to shields, move 3km and then all of a sudden your being hit with nothing in sight and the enemy ship doesn't load. Again ships lost.
[*] Griefing, you can grief a whole server by 'coring' an enemy vessles and unloading the playing field. On MP servers, these will never spawn again, so your saves will never last you forever.
[*] The crafting system, no way to accurately tell why you cannot craft (end game) something late game, it will be a missing material but good luck finding out.
[*] The UI is VERY BASIC and is restricted by Eleon, it's improved from older versions but by any standard you cannot do simple things such as search for an item, only a single player can access a cargo box at any time. You cannot set harvesting weapons to a specific harvest box.
[*] Shields - [spoiler] Only recharge out of combat, no way to 'tank' [/spoiler]
[*] The weapon information is all Damage Per Minute and doesn't provide useful information. (12 emp cruise does about 250k damage to shields, but an enemy with 450k i do about 7%.... WHY?!)
[*] Theres no information even on the Wiki, try working out 'How ships size class is calculated', it's none sense.
[*] There's no Linux server only windows, our restricted server (Class 15) requires 2 restarts a day.
[*] To admin the game is a player created console. 
[*] THRUSTERS. when you disable an enemy ship, if your unlucky enough for the thrusters to not turn off, the ship is uneterable and unsalvageable
[*] If your server changes IP, your Factory resets and everything is lost. Like Eleon, implement fingerprints so this doesn't happen.. COME ON
[/list]

[h1] PvP [/h1]
I would never test this due to the frame rate issues.

[h1] Building [/h1]
Building, is great. You have a variety of different shapes that can enable mostly pretty much anything. Limiting factor here is the colours and the textures.

[h1] Best part [/h1]
The community, without the mods and Scenarios the game would be certainly gone. The integration with the workshop is amazing to collaborate with friends and strangers and improve upon designs.

[h1] Worst part [/h1]
The worst part about the game is the missing information, i learned 99% of the game watching Spanj's play-throughs. And even helped players with over 2k hours in game with content they didn't know existed. Eleon are touchy at best, ask a question and they answer... Don't requestion it or you get warnings in their discord, threatening a ban. However they are active in there for vanilla scenario only and mainly rely on the community to help you out.

[h1] Overall [/h1]
Hopefully you read all the above, but would i recommend the game? Strangely yes, specifically only if you have friends to play with, the price is cheap and you have multiple scenarios that can enhance game play. Otherwise no, it can be very monotonous.

If you join a server try 'Where Am I (UK)' Fantastic community and an active server owner who does his best to help.

The building system is convoluted, not fun or engaging but aggravating and tedious. I had to resort to searching online to find out how to build just the smallest of transportation vehicles and finally was able to obtain a vehicle only to find out that controlling the damn thing is nigh impossible. It goes 3000 MPH and the slightest touch of left/right turns it WAY too much. Not to mention that the up/down is controlled by your mouse movements, it is absolutely not intuitive and doesn't integrate well at all into being able to pilot a simple vehicle across the starter planet.

I eventually found a quest giver and was eager to experience questing. I found some resource, ran it to the turn in and picked up another quest. it was the same quest. I did that quest and picked up a third quest, IT WAS THE SAME QUEST.

After struggling with the stupid vehicle for an hour and not wanting to do the quest a fourth time, i quit. I never even got into space because  F  this game. It's a waste of time and i'm pissed that i blew $20 on this garbage. The devs should be ashamed.

Empyrion Is Not Space Engineers. But, this is a good thing because a lot of the things that makes SE frustrating EGS has really streamlined.

For example, one of the first things you have to do in SE is build a builder/miner drone ship - Empy gives you one the minute you start the game. This lets you dig without worrying about getting stuck, and build in gravity without worrying about your jetpack wearing out.

Mining doesn't require looking for hard to see deposits on the surface, but instead they are shown directly on your screen.

Automated repairing doesn't mean building a projector and fiddling with it for a long time to get it properly aligned with your ship, and missing internal bits that you can't easily fix without tearing the ship apart. Instead you can build a repair console or visit an advanced station that offers repair facility.

1.8.8 has added a reworked start, with 4 small moons providing different environments and difficulty levels.  These new starting moons are still linked - even if you start on the easy moon, you'll still need to visit the other moons for specialized resources only available (or the volume you need) in that moon. 

This is also true for biomes on a single moon, with different resources requiring searching the moon to find. Even underwater offers unique resources like small amounts of promethium (fuel and energy) and pentaxid (for warp jumps).

The only limitation for EGS vs SE is the lack of moveable parts.  The only semi-moveable part in SE is the blast door, which can be used to create simple landing legs. If you want pistons and hinges, unfortunately SE is the only place for that.


Old Review:

With the 1.5 release, Empyrion finally is starting to be balanced and playable for a new user. There is still a badly outdated wiki and much of the threads out there are no longer relevant, but the core of the game is pretty solid. You can build a base, a tank, a spaceship, and follow the storyline or forge your own path of burning wreckage across the galaxy.

There still needs to be a general tuneup of the economy, and a re-balance of things like the food subsystem, but it is very fun now.",1626114138,1662937747,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Me with 400 hours in-gameplay:
Ideas, anyone? Or is there anymore love to this game?

1.0. Let There Be Life In Empyrion:

+1.1. Give all NPCs breath of life. They're supposed to be able to physically go by Hover vehicles, small vehicles, and capital vehicles around the planet, go out of atmosphere, into atmosphere, and around galaxy for whatever purpose they have. Galaxy is teeming with life and their activities. (One of many little examples, a player started off in a planet and suddenly a Polaris Trade Ship passes right above by Player's base and going up then out of Planet's atmosphere)

+1.2. Predatory behavior between animals.
Predators hunt everyone. And preys will try to run, or fight back predators together. Whether their attack is ranged or melee, it should be animated.

+1.3. Hunting behavior of NPC Faction members against some specific animals, or in vice versa.

+1.4. Trees and organic based objects can grow back.
The flora and fauna in wildlife that perished can cultivate themselves back to life.
""Life finds a way.""-Ian Malcolm.

+1.5. More animals and its behavior.
More animals variations and their activities animations. Animals behave, not just walk around and eat randomly. Make them sleep, play, or even controversially, “mate”, for instance?

+1.6. More plants variants.
Add more variations of plants.

+1.7. Water features like in that other game ""Breakwater"".



2.0. Trade:
2.1. N/A

3.0. Visits:

+3.1. A friendly visit.
Once Player has good reputation with a Faction and owns a base, that NPC Faction will begin visiting the base often (once every 2-7 days). Friendly NPCs visiting Player consist of a trader and security personnel, Player being notified through PDA, and they are just passing by the Player's base.

+3.2. NPC's avoiding conflict behavior.
Factions will not visit a Player's base who doesn't have Friendly (or above) reputation to them.

+3.3. NPC's goodwill behavior.
Honored reputation will lead to a more frequent visits and discounts in a visit trade.


4.0. The War (The most exciting part), detailed as follow:

+4.1. Territorial war:
It is better to have wars instead of raid, taking example of the good old-other game: GTA San Andreas where two-three factions have regular weapon contacts in specific areas of the map, territorial war, or just in any encounters of circumstances between rival members. They shall try to attack each other (It is to stop following the style of ""just like another zombie survival games"", Empyrion is not like other games, it is much more astronomical).

+4.2. All factions have their own reputation towards each other as the game progresses.
For example, if Zyrax faction killed a lot of Talon soldiers in a territorial war, Zyrax's reputation will worsen in the face of Talon Faction.
If Talon accidentally shoot an arrow to a Polaris member, Talon's reputation will worsen for Polaris Faction. And so on.

+4.3. Circular Shaped Territories on planets and Galactic Space change shape fluidly due to small/big battles being won/lost between factions.
Territorial wars becomes visible only if Player enters the area of discovery. When player is outside of discovery area, the PDA only gives notification of war started being fought and its ending result, (who won, lost, or stalemate).

+4.4. Unexpected Encounter.
In an incident when two factions pay the Player a visit at the same time. If those two factions are at ""Unfriendly state of reputation"", a small battle will break out between them, and the Player's base will be their battle ground, taking real damage.


5.0. Space the final frontier:

+5.1. Asteroids are based on crushed stone and are mine-able.

+5.2. Make sun,stars,blackholes accessible and warp-able, dealing damage to players and ships alike when approached too close.

+5.3. Make space ships drifts freely without having to have the engine Active. And being the player inside the vessel.

+5.4. Being able to walk freely within our own vessels while they are moving (CV,SV,HV).
Sp*ce Eng*neers workshop literally have a moving train in the game.

+5.5. CV,SV,HV are supposed to be falling to the ground after the owner left them without power.



+6.0. Interactable Items.
+6.1. TVs are turned on and tuned into Eleon advertisement (Please fill any scenses on the TV).
+6.2. 
+6.3. Players sit and sleep on the bed/tent camp, animated.
+6.4. 
+6.5. 
+6.6. Finished functional Console Deco and Tech.",1592897338,1662830669,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If I think of the other games that I've played like this, like No Man's Sky or Astroneer or Subnautica or Satisfactory, they ALL were easy to understand and didn't require me to use google even once during the first couple hours of the game... but THIS game however, just turns everything into a convoluted mess. Just building my first vehicle took 50 minutes... 50 freaking minutes, where as in Astroneer, my first vehicle took just 2minutes and in Astroneer I built an entire railway loop plus a train in 1hour... I just can't recommend a game that has as many convoluted mechanics as this game does. Also, the game runs like dog water and it looks like dog water too.

A number of core issues really, game performance is a big one, it's just getting worse... 

Second is the game is essentially on life support, Project Eden and Reforged Galaxy are the two mods keeping this alive from what I can see and the developers seem to be just limping the game on. Eleon are implementing features from these two awesome mods into the base game with an Eleon twist... and it is so blindingly obvious when this happens. Which is adding to my frustrations with the game in general.

Yes, visuals have improved, but at a cost of more performance, and lets not even go into the fact they have a DB back end that Eleon cannot/will not change even though it really, really needs update and overhaul.
The issues with losing ships while jumping, is an inherent DB /sqllite query issue and yet this wont improve as the people involved in implementing this have left Eleon or moved to other areas that removes them from the DB development/updates.

Tl;Dr
A decent game, that is now plagued by increasing performance issues and lack of developer creativity, Empyrion has had its time, now I think its time to let it pass with what little dignity it has left.



Steam really needs to have ""mostly yes"" and ""mostly no"" buttons. As for the most part yes, I recommend this game...

The content available currently, the story the Eleon are building, the way the game has grown from a single solar system to an entire galaxy to explore is just fantastic.
The Eleon / Player interaction levels of player stuff being made official is great, shows real appreciation for the community.
The growing number of factions and territories is great.
Some POI's are easy, some are utter death... just the way they should be... just beware of rocket Zirax... :)
Claiming an enemy base is great fun, but don't expect it to go unnoticed.

The game feels well balanced in places, well paced in places, progression doesn't feel rushed or overly slow, the tech tree needs work but that's been ""Coming Soon"" (ish) for a while... generally I can go from escape pod to SV in a few hours... but even with nearly 1000 hours of play time, I'm no expert... some would manage the same in half that... :)
Scenarios. Enough said... Project Eden and Reforged Eden are (in my opinion) the best ways to enjoy Empyrion, I haven't played Vanilla in over two years, except for Spanj's Death Races...

The game needs optimization, it should have been before a 1.0 release... despite being way over the recommended requirements, there are times in single player where the game struggles, this is magnified on multiplayer servers... 14 people on a playfield is a lag fest before you throw combat into the mix.
Pretty sure this game only uses one core, so please add multi-threading... 
No Linux server hosting option? Come on...
Weird things are hard-coded, apparently for bug fixing, but I do wonder if it was more ""this'll do"" 
Finish/plan to finish the half baked features, Logistics is still work in progress a couple years after adding it... Although I like the factory as is, I agree it's weird and needs something better in place, I'll send an idea over to the official discord... see how that goes...  
Allow us to core and claim patrol ships... if they have OP weapons, make the turrets explode (overload due to incompatibilities with Terran cores is a reason...)
Total, Ambient and Music are not audio options... we could use player, vessel, environment, NPC, creature, base and faction audio levels... I play with headphones for the most part and I have total volume down to about 10% and abominations and turrets are still too damned loud!
More building block shapes... Plenty of people asking for them, decent builders too...

TD;DR
Fundamentally, a great game... it has issues, as most games do but I do see Empyrion going places I have enjoyed almost every hour of gameplay, and that's saying something... Wait till Empyrion is on offer if you're on the fence, but if you want a space sci-fi survival game, Empyrion is definitely worth the current £14.99 price.

I loved this game.  Put in 1600 hundred hours. Countless good memories and friends made. Clans forged and ships built on hostile worlds. Wars fought with other players. Outright thievery. I even stole a CV, marooned the human crew we didn't kill on a planet with not enough resources. After a few days I sold it back to them. They had asked for it, and boy did they receive.

Fought plenty of fair play duels too. Players belongings (including my own sometimes) were respected. Rides to home planets given. I have done runs with player traders keeping them safe from NPC factions, and players alike.  

So why have I thumbs down my favorite game of all time you ask? 

All 1600 hours have been logged on the same machine. A machine that can handle every game I throw at it. Except Emperyion now...

After your last big update the game became unplayable. It won't even load into single player. After the most recent one I cannot even get start screen up. Just loads forever.

Yes, all the things I've had to do countless times before to get this game to work were done. Not my first rodeo. In fact the last time this game ran this way was after your VERY FIRST UPDATE EVER.

Superficially for the first hour or 2 it's a slightly clunky/outdated feeling Space Engineers with tons of GUI data that is a bit overwhelming. 

In depth, it's like Space Engineers plus 100 decorative/weapons/planets/interstellar/campaign related DLCs, except there's no ******* DLC at all it just comes with the game!

I had looked at this years ago and immediately quit because it spawned me in some base and had me build a prefab motorcycle or something. It didn't have the right feel to it.

I picked it up again for another try just recently and this time it spawned me in a crashing emergency shuttle in a survival scenario, and THAT was what I was looking for! I want to know how to start from nothing to learn all the basics, I don't want some prefab base that's just too much info to start with.

Cons:
Yes it's very clunky around the edges, has some performance problems, GUI slowness, meh AI, and ok/buggy storyline. 

Pros:
Better than Space Engineers, but similar feel. 

S.E focuses on the act of building some ship in a sandbox, but there's not much else. 

Empyrion focuses more on accumulating resources to either custom build or just factory print a prefab, and the prefabs are GREAT. I'm fine with just dumping resources in a bin and getting a fancy hoverbike IF IT MEANS I DON'T HAVE TO BUILD A WALL OF CONVEYORED WELDER PISTONS AGAINST A PROJECTOR AND THEN HAVE IT MISS A BLOCK I CAN'T FIND AND THEN INEVITABLY DIE FROM THE KRAKEN RIP. 

Plus there's multiple solar systems and asteroid fields and it's GORGEOUS. Looks way better than S.E. and has some breathtaking space views wow. 

Unlike S.E., it actually has a storyline and enemies. Would like to emphasize that I've spent lots of time with mods in S.E. just trying to get something to shoot at dangit!

so with a basic base (workshop blueprints if you want to skip the whole purpose of survival) basic constructor you can say you won survival as as long as you have food and air (no air required on first planet). 
 If its survival mode there's no reason to leave starter planet, if you do build a SV or CV then the only reason to visit other planets is to start whole process of grind, build again.
Survival lacks Survival elements to be a pure survival and if your a new player better get used to looking online for guides as tutorial is Completely useless.

I only played survival mode as creative is only if you want to play around or build blueprints (not my cup of tea). There are challenges too but i was so bored after survival i gave up.

As many stated, while this game is somewhat similar to Space Engineers, it has its own interesting build and logistics systems. Yes, it's somewhat more limiting mechanically, but much more flexible in decoration department. Combat is muuuch better than SE. And salvaging feels much more satisfying due to rare resources/artifacts/epic loot, and pattern spawning is a damn good QoL feat, but what it really supposed to shine in - the survival and world aspects. 

Survival is great. Wildlife, food, ariety of effects and conditions, you name it. No questions here. The world, the quests, on the other hand, were utterly and completely broken for me. I started the new game 3 times and 3 times it broke in the first chapter on a different state and different mission. And I have no idea what I am supposed to do. Tell me what I did wrong, dammit! 

Which is sad, because I really liked the horror feeling of some locations, but without the working mission / quest log I wasnt sure what to do there. And they rarely seem to have luxury of existing like independent sites which you can visit whenever with varying results depending on your progress, while clearly communicating that ""This door is opened later in the game"". For instance, the Planetary Remnant mission will spawn an NPC who could not possiby be there, and will give you no explanation, and no events at the end. Again, tell me what I did wrong, dammit!

Until this issue is fixed, it's really hard to give this game a go. I feel like I miss the big part of the fun. Still, you can mine a ton of resources and build fantastic ships.

    [*]The Engine is full of bugs and limitations. For example you can't walk inside a ship while it's moving. And you can't have 2 players access the same container simultaneously. In 2022 this is quite obsolete.
    [*]The quest system is very limited. You can only have one active quest at a time. It often fails to register the events and move to the next stage so you constantly have to manually mark quests as complete.
    [*]The writing is quite bad. Some of the quest lines remind me of the custom tabletop roleplay stories we made up when we were teenagers. Yes, it is that bad.
    [*]The combat gameplay is not very engaging. Enemies don't have any recognizable pattern or smart reactions. Most of the time this comes down to cheesing the AI.

The building/crafting is rather soothing, and when i'm in for some thrill, I go exploring or raiding POIs.

There are still some KEY parts however which always put me off after a while. Please don't take them negatively, consider these more like wishes, things that, if they ever get implemented, will make Empyrion a game of my life.

- Exploration - This is a big disappointment for me. I know the DEVs are doing their best and it's slowly getting better at least content-wise but there's just too many limitations. The local area around planets is tiny, apart from a couple of POIs and some asteroids, you can't really leave an orbit of a planet, set a course and venture out into darkness in hopes of finding something. You need to sit in the cockpit, aim for some asteroid/POI, limited to the area around that given planet all that while moving at speeds with limits lower than German highways. The space feels more like a cage and lacks freedom, lacks the adventure games like EVE have to offer (random deep space sites, bandits, relics, no limits to where you can go, set a waypoint deep in the space, build base, warp out, warp in, ...). 

- Once you get to a certain stage (which is pretty early I would say) You don't really have much to do anymore apart from making your base/capital vessel bigger and eating more energy. Add some deep space materials for top tier items/upgrades/weapons, add relics to set on display on your base, allow players to move freely out of predefined regions, maybe even elusive deep space factions with faction specific devices/weapons/thrusters/warp drives/... )

- Quests - This could be something that will eventually tackle previous point, but at this stage, they are buggy, repetitive, non rewarding at all and dull. The story behind is very thin and all that quest interface feels dodgy, sometimes the game switches to windowed view on its own, the UI elements are chaotic and the embeded video player is.. well it all feels very cheap and rushed.
The quest log is probably a very early attempt or a proof of concept, as I don't think they seriously expect players to make 10 clicks to find their relevant quests on the particular planet. At least it could pre-filter by current area/faction zone.
The quest interface feels like web pages in 2005.

- Energy - Why can we have solar for bases to keep basic stuff/life support running, but on CVs you go sleep and wake up with power out, no oxygen and all food rotten... Please allow at least some basic Solar power on vessels.

- The SOUNDS - everything sound related in this game is creepy, there's a ton of jump scares due to volume inbalances and bad mix. When doing any activity i need to turn the volume down, if there's a raptor anywhere nearby, it sounds more like theres a zombie right behind me. Most activities could really use sound redesign and rebalancing, except vessel sounds and thrusters, those are pretty well done.

In the normal ""beginner"" starting survival scenario, you start on a planet that is relatively friendly (plenty of oxygen and no imminent danger of dying).  Run around gathering resources to keep from starving, but there's really no hurry.  Eventually you find some nearby interesting buildings which start you down the path of building a motorcycle - which is a kick in the pants!  The bike could be a little better though - it hardly has enough power to go up steep hills - but it's still pretty fun to ride.

Eventually build a base and a hovercraft which is weird to start out with.  Exploring this planet reveals several different biomes and some of them have velociraptors that are deadly.  I didn't much like the hovercraft until I figured out how to mount gattling guns on it - and then the velociraptors weren't a problem anymore!

There are also some other planets that can be accessed before even building a spaceship.  There's like a portal that lets you go to those, but they are also more difficult.

So far I've only mostly explored the starter planet (except for underwater - but that's supposed to be worthwhile too).  There are native tribesman that will frown and possibly attack my base if I keep drilling on their land - so getting enough resources to build a spaceship in addition to the hovercraft will take some work on other planets - or just kill all the natives - but I'd rather keep them peaceful, as they have quests they hand out too.  Do enough quests and they won't mind you drilling either.

This game's technology tree and build system reminds me of From The Depths - but not quite as brutally complex as that is, and the UI is a little more forgiving than that game.  I really enjoy the LEGO-like build system.  I haven't figured out how to mold a finished ship yet - so my builds are very clunky looking right now - but functional.

That's what No Man's Sky was completely missing - LEGO-like ship-building, and also realistic planets.  I can fly the hovercraft from the North Pole to the South Pole of the planet in maybe 10 minutes or less - it's all 1 contiguous map, and the location of the sun changes as I go, such that the day/night cycle is affected.  Really cool!

The technology tree and UI is fairly convoluted though - which has turned some players off.  There is even logic with AND/OR/XOR/etc to somehow cause things to trigger.

The graphics are nice - although I've only seen planet-side so far.  If I find more surprises worth writing about I'll update this review when I get to space - but for now this is a solid game worth anyone's time to learn and explore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE:

After playing another 40 hours or so, I'm still not able to jump to other stars, but I can jump to other planets in my solar system, and I just finished building a capital ship that is just missing 1 piece (the warp drive) before it will be able to jump to other stars!

This game is by far one of my favorites.  It is not the most intuitive though, and takes a significant effort to figure out how everything works.  In some cases it might make sense to join a multiplayer server just to be able to ask other players how stuff works, as they might be able to help you faster than posting on the forums.

I have only played it in single player, and there are some big advantages by playing it in single player, the biggest being you can save and revert to older saves if you blow yourself up.  In multiplayer if a dedicated server is running, if you die then you'll just have to build things up again with whatever is left over from when you crashed and burned.  I don't care much for multiplayer with strangers and without voice - as I'd rather just avoid any grief players that might come along too.

The game is really a blast and all the initial ""alpha"" stuff that had turned me off when I had first seen it is all gone - the game really sparkles and is a joy to play.  But, 2 hours is not even close to what you'll need to get a feel for all the game has to offer - it will only scratch the surface.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 2:

It wasn't very long after the first update above that I jumped to a new star system!  This was a little bit scary, as I had no idea what to expect, so I made it a priority to first build a base in that system just in case I ran into trouble.

Eventually it became clear that one of the game workflows is going to be to set up a large network of automated miners strewn over several planets, to allow collecting an infinite amount of resources by jumping via transporters from base to base to collect ore and then smelt it all into ingots, for the purpose of building the biggest freaking ship in the galaxy.  But I'm getting WAY ahead of myself - I've only got 1 auto miner so far - it will take quite a while to get to that point.

It is a bit tempting to play on a multiplayer server now, as it would be more interesting to have the worlds continue turning while I'm not logged in.  That might be worth trying some time.

Other really nice details are all the wonderful ways you can die.  I visited a store on one planet that had someone decide to attack me, and he bit me - which led to being poisoned that needed specific medicine, which turned into a wound, that later got infected and was going to turn into sepsis if it wasn't treated in time - but by then I was back at my base and I could cook up some medicine in the kitchen for it.  And not a moment too soon either!  Whew!

And another time I found my capitol ship had not gotten close enough to the ground, so I couldn't jump high enough to get back in.  And the gravity on that planet was so high that every time I jumped I would break bones coming back down too!  This was a wonderful feeling of being stranded, while my ship was just inches too far away!  I eventually figured out a way to resolve that - and I now carry some extra parts in my inventory just in case that happens again.",1659385976,1661339429,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First and foremost this game badly needs better vehicle physics. I still remember Motocross Madness (1998) and Battlezone 2 (1999), those games are now ancient but their vehicle physics made them fun to play, even today, and remembering them really drives home just how bad the vehicle handling is in this game. Motorcycles and hovercraft in this game are just horrible to drive, the motorcycle in particular handles nothing like one, it just hugs the ground and turns very very slowly. You will also get stuck on trees and rocks often. 

Secondly, the graphics are really a mixed bag. The scenery really can look great at times, but the NPC and player models... oh dear.  The NPCs are barely adequate, except their animations are very simple and loopy and the textures look like they are from the PS2 era. The worst however is the player, who is potentially the ugliest looking avatar I've ever seen in a game. What was the inspiration? Sloth from The Goonies? You are subject to his ghastly appearance every time you go to the inventory screen. Not only is he physically repulsive, but the technical implementation of him bad - there is no lighting or shadows on that screen, he is just lit face-on. Come on guys, a little lighting and shadow (preferably covering his face) would go a long way. This makes the Mass Effect Andromeda team look half competent.

If it weren't for these two things I would give it a positive rating.",1661289063,1661289107,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

It enables so much, you have vast creative freedom to build and utilize whatever you can imagine -- and there is a great deal of things for you to use your ships and buildings for. With a massive procedurally generated galaxy with thousands of stars, each with a dozen planets and moons, each of them with randomly generated terrain with randomly placed POIs for you to explore, destroy, loot, salvage... 

The blueprint factory allows you to build a masterpiece in creative mode where it's easier to do so, then save it and bring your creation into survival mode, or onto any servers you play on. Just feed the factory all of the materials and start the timer, then spawn your ship when it's done. The paint's finished, the blocks are all in their right places, what a lovely mechanic. It takes all of the tedium out of building things, because you basically only have to build things once. You can move on to making newer and nicer things.

POIs (Points of Interest) are interesting. Many of them are community made structures that can either be a single room with a couple of goodies in it, or a 4 hour dungeon crawl with hundreds of enemies inside. If POI regeneration is turned off, you can destroy enemy buildings and conquer the entire enemy territory, rendering your planet as completely peaceful and halting enemy attacks on your bases located there.

The enemy AI is incredibly rudimentary, for worse and for worse. They either stare at a wall, get stuck behind a potted plant, or snipe your face off from the end of a 100 meter corridor. 
The weapons, animations, sound design, models.... Everything is a low budget, pre-made, bought unity asset that is the absolute bare minimum quality. 

If you pretend it's 2003, this game is mind blowing. While you're doing one of those dungeon crawls with scorpions and spiders running at you, emptying your low-poly-count generic machine gun into them, the ship that you designed yourself is still parked outside, the world beyond still exists, and your friends could be back at base tending to the garden. That's what I think is nice, having such a vast world that can all exist at the same time. 

I have several gripes about the way the game works, like not being able to get out of your seat unless your ship is totally stationary, or how you can't be standing up when the ship starts moving or else it ghosts through you, or how clunky the physics is, or how if your ship registers even partially buried in the terrain, it'll teleport into the sky with or without you. Maybe a little frustrating that if you get out of your seat, the ship won't really hold a hover on its own -- for some reason in multiplayer it'll slowly start to sink out of the sky... While other times your ship will stick in the sky even with the power turned off. Very dorky physics, lots of improvements to be made.

Anyway, well worth the money. It's like playing with lego, then getting to use those lego to explore the galaxy (However generic and repetitive that galaxy may feel).

Used to be multiplayer cheats however after playing this game another 600+ hours on single player I can't comment on how multiplayer is now days.  I thought I'd better update my review.

TLDR: Many things set this game apart from other survival space games, and even from other voxel-based games.
- You have true freedom to build amazing vessels - including small space ships and capital vessels, and you will use these ships to explore the galaxy.
- The Galaxy itself is not only incredibly beautiful, but keeps on inviting you to explore more, because there is something new behind basically every rock.
- The enemies, the ""friends"", and the monsters, and the ways in which they attack, even run away when you hurt them, keeps the game interesting.
- The game challenges you to find solutions to problems.  The ""physics"" of limited storage volume, weight, and the effects these have on the performance of your vessel, the increasing difficulty of enemies, and the mistakes we make, all add up to a learning experience, and you need to be prepared to lose your ship to a too-powerful enemy, along with everything in the storage hold, at least once.  You will make mistakes and you will learn from them.

You start off stranded on a planet in space, with only a basic crafting capability built into your suit.  You then have to survive the environment while looking for resources, and then set up a base and work on obtaining your first vehicle.

The moment you have your first small flying craft, or your first hovercraft, a lot more opportunities open up and the game progresses faster and faster.  In the meantime you attract the attention of the Zirax, who will start sending their drones to harass your base while you will do your best to destroy and kill them, infiltrating and looting their bases in return.

Soon you will make your way into space in a vessel you built yourself.  From scratch, block by block, in a way only a voxel-based game could make possible.  Stick some thrusters, generators, and a fuel tank to a ""seat"" and you're able to fly, but to do it in style you want to adjust the shape of every block, give them purpose, add a full hull to surround you, add windows, and make it airtight to protect you in space.  Then of course you will be adding some decorative blocks, painting and texturing it, applying your personal style (or in my case, lack of style) to the ship.

I will never forget the feeling of amazement I experienced the first time I was using my jet pack in space, with a laser drill, mining into an asteroid, to get cobalt to take back to my base to craft more advanced items.

As you progress you will unlock more and more skills, and soon enough find the resources and the skills to warp to other stars. You will encounter the other denizens of the galaxy, trade with them, and grow your reputation until they allow you to ""Teleport"" directly to their bases. You will keep on exploring, finding wreckages of ships and bases that you will salvage for materials.  All of this is used to improve on your own ship, adding more, but soon physics gets in the way.

You will need bigger thrusters to move the heavier ship, you will need shields to protect against dangerous enemies, your ship will require more CPU power and bigger generators to feed it all, and to feed the generators and craft the CPU extenders you will need more and more resources.

The game will soon have you exploring strange planets to find those resources, and the sights and scenery just keep on amazing.  Sunsets and lakes, mountains and deep crevasses, pools of lava, and more and more strange wrecks, infected and infested abandoned bases, and the ever-present Zirax will keep you engrossed.

The game does have a basic storyline, with a few quests and missions, but this is hardly the main point of the game, at least now.  Eleon is still working on improving the game, and even adding to the missions and quests.  However at its heart, the game is truly an Open World game - there isn't even a path to follow.

There is much much more to the game.  There's the workshop with literally thousands of player-contributed ships.  The world itself is fully destroyable.  The game is extremely open to modders, to the point where the game is almost a reference implementation of a platform for artists to build their own games on.  There's signal logic.  There's resource and storage management.  Did I forget to mention you have a drone?  This adds a whole strategy level to infiltrating POIs as you can use it to safely ""peek around corners"".  There's weather and atmospheric effects and their impact on our health.  Remembering to eat and maintain your oxygen supply.  Dealing with injuries, infections, and debuffs.  Finding unique and new weapons. Finding shady traders hiding in the back corners of the space station's warehouse.  Learning where the weak points are of enemy ships.  And and and.

Is it all positive?  Of course not.  The bugs in the game can be frustrating.  The interface can be unintuitive.  Enemies sometimes spawn underground.  But consider that the ""ground"" is also voxel-based and at the same time ""flows"" ... and this becomes one of the quirks we just have to live with.  Rename a container and it renames itself back - Sigh.  Fortunately, the name will stick if you just do it again.  Doing something advanced with signal logic and your AND, OR and XOR gates won't do what they are supposed to?  Ah well, I would still rather have the ability to play with these signals than not, even if they are funky.

Much more important is that this game is under constant development.  It gets regular updates - generally every 2 weeks or so, and players are encouraged to submit their own bug reports.  If you read the old forum posts where people ask for features to be added, and look at the game today, it is easy to see that the devs listen, and do add features that players wish for.

Overall the bugs can be overlooked as they don't spoil the experience, and the game is simply something so far out from the norm that there is simply nothing that comes even close to touching it.

On the one hand, there are some VERY rough elements - such as the 'tutorial' or help sections (which is to throw a lot of text at you that occasionally makes a vague kind of sense), total lack of descriptions on items or how they work (you will spend a lot of time 'playing' Google to help understand the game mechanics), lack of proper quest tracking / history, and don't get me started on building things (wildly over complicated - sort of reminded me of Wurm Online). Combat can be rough and mobs often don't spawn until you're next to them (which makes my usual sneaky, long range play style a little obsolete)

If you can stick through the first few hours and find some nice ship and base blueprints in the Workshop, you'll be set up to really get into the game.

Ship upgrades do feel like upgrades and I went from nervously flying around star systems hoping to not be noticed, to tracking down the enemies for a dog fight!

The first you encounter, Tales of Tash, isn't really a quest line and just...ends. No development of the story, no conclusion, no indication that you've finished.

The canned and instant ships thing was a major part of the suck factor. As well just try building ANYTHING in actual survival after hours of boring grind collecting resources without the ""instant"" ship and see just how much that sucks getting pummeled by instant overwhelming odds setting you back to the beginning for more senseless grind! 

2 dimensional cardboard cutout looking and dumber than brick stupid ""NPC"" adversaries another big downer. i mean if you going to suck so bad at the implementation just skip them like Space Engineers did. Seriously Castle wolfenstien or doom adversaries were better in my memory and they take like virtually zero resources compared to the rest of the game. How do the two big space sims fall sooooo terribly flat?

i have to admit that a large part of the short comings for this game for me came from the fact i had played space engineers first and what i was hoping for was something to fill in where that one fell flat in vanilla but instead this one bombed much worse.

Nothing to do with my PC.

I'm runing a 2060 super and i5 (yesiknowineedtoupgrade) with plenty of ram at 2560 x 1440 monitor,
running it in this res and the lowest graphical settings available brings my CPU temp up to 70 degrees (C), I had originally launched it at maximum graphical settings at my correct res (thinking since it doesn't *look* - graphics wise - very good it wouldn't matter) but holy heck that was a mistake, one of the VERY few games that forces my cpu temp up to over 80.

I tried all the tricks from 2020 to 2019 discussions (lowering your res, locking your fps to 60, some said 30 but I suffer from extremely sensitive motion sickness in games so thats a no-can-do) and managed to push it down to 55ish-65ish degrees, but that is what Cyberpunk runs at for me (around 65) on high and I can live with that BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY LOOKS GOOD WHILE DOING SO. 
and for whatever fucking reason I had this insanely annoying audio stutter that happened *literally* every 3 seconds (apparently it has something to do with programs in the background? I have nothing except 2 youtube videos loaded to watch/listen - not playing - and a picture of a ship I was planning to build (inspired by lmao) in the game). So it wasn't that.

I can play cyberpunk on high with a almost solid 60 fps all around the map, I can run star citizen on high, I should be able to run this on atleast medium in my monitor's res and get a solid 50-60 while doing so, bugs are another thing but optimisation is another, more important, thing.

This game is more than just another space exploration sandbox. It offers an individualized experience where you can role play, create, and survive in a plethora of ways. There are  limitless tactics at your disposal to survive, create, and destroy. You are only limited by your imagination.

This game is vast. Players can begin each new game within a multi-solar system setting created through procedural generation. Within each system is a celestial playing field populated by yet more moons and planets which house still more titanic playing fields created through procedural generation. Oh, and add randomized points of interest (POI's) which often house their own stories and experiences.  I have easily spent a dozen hours in a system just exploring. Below is an example if you're interested.

Just last night, after six hours of traversing the Zirax Empire's frontier, My capital vessel (CV) was a Shovelhead class ship I stole from the colonist faction a day prior. It was armed well with cannons, rocket launchers, plasma turrets, and shields. While exploring, I happened upon a Sathium asteroid. For those of you who don't know what Sathium is, it's a necessary building component for any Captial Vessel with combat worthy armor and higher tier equipment. Sathium is not to impossible to find and can often be salvaged from wrecks, but a Sathium asteroid possesses substantial yield comparatively. 

As soon as I began to close in on this delectable Sathium deposit, I was confronted by one of the most well-armed and colossal NPC ships I have seen to date. The vessel was slim and vertically oriented in design, flanked with exceptional firepower in the form of numerous turrets. It was a ship built for war. I skirted the vessel's position, teasing out its range which I discovered was roughly 1 km. I engaged carefully as to better understand its combat abilities. Within a few dozen seconds my shield was shredded. Alarmed at the sudden rate of shield depletion I immediately reversed thruster output to leave. Unforunately at this point I had began taking physical damage. I somehow managed to escape complete destruction though and the Zirax began to give chase. 

Just as I turned to leave the conflict I made a crestfallen revelation. Space pirates had arrived during this excursion and were now in the immediate vicinity. I happened to have good standing with the local space brigands, Stealing ships from the colonists apparently made them my buddies. Unfortunately... that didn't help in this scenario. Try as I might, I could only watch helplessly as homing missiles systematically disassembled pirate hulls while my shields regenerated. My swashbuckling friends and I lost 3 to 1 to Zirax's extraterrestrial war machine. As I retreated I also made a heart dropping discovery. There was a gaping hole ripped asunder in the aft of my vessel. Guess what? Warp Drive gone! Two rear thrusters missing! I was forced to land on a nearby desert moon instead of warping home to nurse my ship's many wounds, . There I repaired what damage i could, and waited till my brother could log on to send out a distress call. Stranded, frightened, with two hours of system life left and 20% oxygen I now log on tonight to see if I survive long enough for evac. I noticed a crashed capital vessel next to my landing zone. Who knows, maybe I could salvage enough material for a warp drive? I will soon see. ^ . ^ 

This is just one of many stories I have enjoyed from this game. It's one of the few on my list that make me genuinely shout with excitement and simultaneously look blankly into darkness. You will laugh, cry, and thrust your fist and chest out in victory. Simply a joy and a privledge to be able to play this game. I swear. Never would have thought it possible to find something this unique on steam.

For those of you who chose the Forge option in the Halo series and loved Minecraft's creative mode, this game allows you to create free of difficulty from the survival conditions set within the game. Once more, you can share your creations and upload others through the marketplace using a blueprint system within the game. The marketplace-blueprint system is curated and maintained by a network of like minded gamer creatives. It's literally like intergalactic Amazon Prime where you can purchase your intergalactic whip or crib. Except its free.

This game is optimal for those who enjoy games without boundaries.  Players can choose how they wish to play as there are numerous styles that Empyrion accommodates. What you choose to do will decide what you get out of the game. It's an investment where you must research and read threads in order to get everything out of it. Likely, the ""Mostly Positive"" reviews reflects this as those going in expecting structure and direction will quickly lose interest and become frustrated. If this is you, please revisit the game and read threads. I am confident that learning the nuances of this game will rekindle your interest.",1659928041,1659928041,True,35,0,0.754795849323272705,0,True,False,False

But at least it has some soul. Let's get into it:

==== Gameplay ====
Empyrion is what we call a 'survival-crafter-exploration-whatever' game that has more options in it than most of these types of games ever even thought of putting in. The closest you could compare this game to is Space Engineers, but even that pales in comparison in almost every way except in regards to the destruction and physics engine which Space Engineers soars with. 

The gameplay loop is simple: You build stuff you craft things, collect more things with the things you craft to make better stuff. Except here, you can do that in one of four ways: Base building, small-vessel building, hover vessel building, and capital vessel building. Each one of these different templates have different options and functions in their tilesets, and what a tileset it is! While not every combination of block is capable of being seamlessly connected in a way that flows along the lines you intend, there are SO many options that you'd be hard pressed not to find a shape that fits in a way that's at least acceptable when constructing a complex vehicle. 

That being said... there are a lot of flaws with the gameplay. The combat doesn't feel great on foot, there's a very slow speed limit both in and out of atmosphere, the current questing system is not very good and is extremely rudimentary, and you cannot fire MOST capital-class turrets IN atmosphere because of 'muh balance.'

And the game engine is very limited.

HOWEVER.

Massive improvements have been made over the past few years since I started watching this game. They're always adding something new, patching something old, and generally just seem to really give a dang about their game. That's better than you can say for most developers by far. A few weeks ago, I heard that they were going to update player models and make them look a lot better, along with creature models that have been in the game since the beginning. 

That's right, they're REMAKING models to fit the advancing aesthetic of their game.

This game is full of options. You can build underground, in space, in the air, whatever. Not all of it makes sense, but it's JUUUUUST realistic enough to be enjoyable to work with while also being goofy as heck. 

My friends and I are going to have to move our base because we pushed the engine to its limit and built an entire underground fortress and now we're getting like 20 frames per second, but man that thing is HUGE. We now know what we can do, and what we shouldn't do... and it's still super impressive what's possible.

I'm confident it's going to get even better. I hope some day they make a better version of this game once they're done with this one. It's clearly been a learning experience for them. 

==== Music =====
Repetitive, but not terrible.

==== Sound =====
The sounds are a bit oddly balanced, and sometimes sounds which are far away play way closer than they should.

==== Graphics =====
Constantly improving. Not great, but certainly passable! The sunsets and sunrises are beautiful, the terrain is amazing, and the planets are ACTUALLLY ROUND. They're ROUND and they SPIN. They SPIN and you can transition from space to the atmosphere with VERY little trouble most of the time. How many games can boast THAT one?

I mean starfield is coming, but COME ON, man. That's AWESOME for such a little developer!

====Conclusion====
Empyrion is a goofy, fun, developing title that is best described as 'minecraft in space, with ships and some quests'. It's not always fair to you, it's not perfect, and it's not polished. But damn, if it doesn't have some SOUL. Play it for a while, then play it a bit longer. You'll see the little bits of love and effort shining through on this developing gem.

TL;DR
- minecraft in space
- build functional space ships!
- beautiful planets!
- imperfect gameplay
- sound's a bit wonky too sometimes
- don't build a MEGA FORTRESS underground, because the frames may tank. (Or do, but space the rooms out, trust me. It's doable!)
- rudimentary, but improving quest system. 
- filled to the brim with SOUL, baby.
- make giant bunkers and fight the Zirax like a dwarf.
- Go on semi-self-made adventures
- explore the universe
- freeze to death, or burn... or get poisoned... yeah, you can die from a lot.
- sell guns to the locals and become rich!
- And MOOOOORE

But please, do wait if you can't stand imperfect, unpolished games. I'm not recommending this to you unless you can handle workarounds occasionally!",1659839422,1659839422,True,4,0,0.548387110233306885,0,True,False,False

Fans have made 1000s of blueprints that can be used for building bases, hover crafts, and space ships (both large and small), that is, if you don't wish to build your own structures first.  You have multiple factions you can maintain reputation with, which changes how you are allowed to act in their territory if you wish to keep on good terms.  You find and mine minerals on your starting world, build a ship, and travel to other worlds for more materials or raiding points of interest (POI)s.

It's a very large game and is therefore prone to some bugs, but I must say that I have experienced very few after traveling to all four of the starter planets.  Even better, the Devs are still maintaining the game after it has been out for six years or more.

While looking for an exit, I fell down the shaft a second time because the game can't manage to give me a reasonable control to climb down a ladder before I reach it. After the third respawn in the bunker and the same deaths over and over again due to inability to use a ladder, I gave up, also because the death animation looks ridiculous when the doll-like body wiggles around between textures.

Maybe I'll start over and avoid ladders that lead down shafts for now. It's such a pity when games with potential fail because of such little things.

I strongly recommend finding a Reforged Eden server and playing on there rather than offline, it enhances the game even further.  The HWS Reforged Eden servers are great and very active.

Every other open world survival craft game i've played had its merits, but it seems like this game's merits is in deeper/later parts of the game, or in the pure enjoyment of building things.   

""Get used to it... you'll be fine later in the game"" - the building system is like kicking wall with a toothpick under your nails.  

On a less aggressive note, games touting to be sandbox, open world survival games are more and more distancing themselves away from narrative.  You're placed in a universe with very little direction and meaning, even if you do have the ability to create an empire and crazy cool ships etc etc. But this is a single player/coop game (im aware there are servers up to 200 people) and it kind of needs to have more MMO-ey features...

As is there are an INSANE amount of game shattering bugs that the dev team is very slow to fix. I imagine many CAN'T be fixed because of the half broken decade old physics engine. This game looks and plays like something from two system generations ago. This project was WAY too ambitious for a team of their size, and they seem unable or unwilling to hire more staff.

The execution however is appalling, and the improvements are coming at a snails pace if at all. Idk if a small studio is to blame or the devs apathy or what, we'll probably never know why this game has been allowed to exist in such a sorry state for so long.

-Never ending bugs 
-infinitely spawning PVE enemies.   
-You need to complete a mission.  Don't bother.  Example-You have to get X.  You have to go through the front door.  No you can't use explosives to blow a hole in the side of the building.  You have to charge into infinitely respawning enemies.   You died?  OK you can respawn nearby, but opps that is in front of an enemy turret.  Die a few more times.

This game hits everything I have always said I wanted in a space game, space and air combat, that transitions into FPS in POIs. My only gripe is that the single-player subsistence is glitchy; items will vanish, whereas in Long Dark, I can throw objects on the ground and walk away and come back, but they are still there. 

The POIs are fun and challenging, and the FPS combat is well designed. For an indy game, you do it better than some AAA games. I have traps, mazes, and no looking-through wall cheats that I hate.

Pros:
 - There is a story where you can play solo.
 - The world is alive and there are actual survival elements.
 - The planets are actually moving and the maps are separated to simplify performance.
 - You have a purpose to build quality of life in your ship & base in stead of just block spamming more guns, armor and thrusters like what you practically see everyone do in SE servers.

Cons:
 - You can't stand on a moving ship.
 - The weapons and flying are a little too simplified.
 - Game still needs more optimization even when it looks better than SE.
 - Tutorial is as bad as SE or maybe worse.

Empyrion's real draw for me was it's incredible value as an exploration game. Gallivanting across the cosmos while keeping fuel and resources balanced leads to stunning visuals (the pics above really don't do it justice).

Combat is...unorthodox but interesting. Tactics are important, but the game will not tell you the tactics. You really need to go out and die, then understand what happened and form your own tactics around that. Explore, experiment and discover what works for you.

There is a massive community presence. Many have made pseudo shipyard companies posting ships to the workshop. Players past and present also have a heavy hand in the lore building.

I don't do PVP but I know you can setup your own server and invite friends. Most of the negative reviews are likely people who don't like this type of game in the first place or more likely people who play for an hour without understanding even the beginning mechanics of the game because it's so deep and not completely intuitive in the beginning.

If you're looking for a game that focuses on story and/or killing stuff, this is probably not your game. This game has that for certain. But it's a small team of developers and these things are not it's strongest points. If you're more interested in building and surviving than killing and an epic story, there will be enough killing and story to keep you happy. But it's primarily a sand box game.

I'm going on 300 hours of game play and I'm still discovering things. I haven't even built my first capital ship yet. There are quite a few things that I know exist that I haven't discovered and lots of things that I still don't even know exist largely proven by the fact that I just discovered something completely new yesterday.

So, DEFINITELY go through the startup tutorial your first time through because it's easy to play a few hours and not understand what you need to do and quit. Or mistakenly think that the early, find food, oxygen, and shelter while fighting off minor baddies is the whole game. There have been several times where I thought I had found a bug or poor design decision, only to realize that was part of the game, for example, freezing to death in space because I hadn't discovered the EVA boost for my suit that is required (made total sense once I understood the game mechanic) or my harvester not having enough storage space (because you have to add additional storage space as you think you need it or want it).

Not going through the tutorial is probably going to mean you don't even have any idea what you need to do to stay alive for the first hour and are just making it far more difficult on yourself than it has to be. But the game is a reasonable challenge level once you kind of get the hang of it.

Every once in awhile some new challenge comes up, often of your own making, like the time I built a small ship and traveled to a moon with no oxygen only to have the ship - and my way home to oxygen - blown up by passing drone while I was busy mining. Fortunately, I had a base on the other side of the moon, with a decent resupply of oxygen but no way to make more, where I could build the repair parts and enough oxygen on me to reach it although I spent the entire time wondering if this was going to be it for me if I couldn't get back to that base and then return to the ship before my entire oxygen supply ran out. These are the kinds of adventures this game just accidentally creates for you.

You should probably start on Akua on your first play through because it's kind of the ""Eden"" planet. The other starting moons such as Skillion will likely kill you pretty much immediately without oxygen for example. Not that it's hard to make oxygen, you just won't know how to do it. Actually, if you dig some rock and turn it into carbon, you can make all 3 startup construction devices including the portable constructor, the heater, and the oxygen generator. This is the only way to make oxygen until quite a bit later in the game. With those three things you can probably start on any of the moons except maybe the jungle moon (Masperon I think it's called) which has a lot of hostile creatures starting out, all of them do but that one seems worse. You can use your starting tool as a not so great weapon. Maybe that's enough info to help you survive long enough to actually enjoy the game, but I'd still strongly recommend going through the tutorial on your first play of this game.

And when I say ""first play"", I mostly mean you may get a week into the game and realize you would have liked to start differently. Approaching 300 hours of game play, I'm only on my second play of the game. (In a lot of survival games I have exactly 2 play throughs for this reason.)

my recommendation would be play one game in singleplayer without mass/volume or cpu restrictions until you understand the basics, then go play multiplayer eden reforged servers without volume or cpu, eden reforged is a huge modpack adding a ton into the mid to late game and people in servers will be very helpful to explain whatever you don't understand.

games aren't perfect, however this game IS being developed still, more features are being added and polished, i dont believe you shouldn't give the game a chance just because some people are complaining about mechanics that can be turned off, it has a lot to offer.

There is a lot to do in the game, it is a big sandbox universe to play in. You can play it as a relaxed builder/mining experience or when you want some action you can stir the pot and attack a faction to make them hostile, plus there are bases and space derelicts full of aliens that can be a big challenge. You can play the game how you want and when you start you have granular control over the game difficulty so you can tailor the whole experience to your tastes.

A big thumbs up for the crafting system is that some parts need other craftable parts, but so long as it has the materials it will automatically make the intermediate parts, which saves a lot of faffing about.

Downsides in my new play through was the new tutorial which is way harder and less intuitive than the old one. It was just as well I had old knowledge to fall back on to get me through parts of it. I have never been good at the ship construction part of the game, and too early on it prompts you to make a hover vehicle, and I failed miserably at that. Once you place a part wrongly onto the vehicle, with the starter tool you have to salvage the part to remove it, but you lose most the materials. You can make a better tool that would remove parts, but that requires a fuel source that is stupidly rare in the game. Personally at the start I would recommend building the motorbike, it isn't great but is a lot quicker than walking and doesn't require fuel.

I would also recommend new players use the creative mode to learn how to construct stuff in the game as you have unlimited parts (via H key), and you can also spawn in any of the template ships in the game or on the Steam workshop so you can see what you like before you work to get the materials needed in game. Some of the template and workshop ships are just broken, so it saves a lot of heartbreak to try them out first.

The landscape is now pretty to look at, there is a tutorial for brainless dummies, and harvesting and building sucks. Big time.

TL;DR: Toxic inventory tetris thanks to ludicrous volume/mass constraints. Vehicles and bases must now be stupidly small unless you have the mats to build fancy CPU extensions. With basic (starter planet) mats, you can't build sheet any more. 

Used to be, you could mine stuff. Since they activated volume and mass constraints, your inventory can hold ...very little. Okay. Realistic, even if it sucks. So, you build a hovercraft to carry your loot. Only, the standard cargo box can hold less than my inventory. Wait, what? Yep, my pockets are bigger on the inside than a whole box that is bigger than me.

Okay... soooo.... there are container controllers, and container extensions. They consume CPU power, though... crap.
Without fancy materials to build CPU extensions, you can barely fit two guns on a hovercraft (yep, one static, front-mounted projectile weapon consumes processor cycles for some arcane reason, and a lot of it), and have barely enough thrusters in each direction that your vessel moves like a polished brick on ice. So, decide between thrusters, OR guns, OR containers. 

Okay, scrap the hovercraft idea, let's build a base first. 
So, I mine an inventory full of stone and produce some concrete blocks... to find out I can put a whopping seven (7) of them into my inventory, before the volume is maxed. Okay, I put down a few at a time until I have a small, square terrace of concrete lying in the dirt.
Time to find out you cannot fit 1 base starter block, 1 generator, 1 fuel tank and 1 small constructor in your inventory at the same time. A couple trips later, my pathetic wannabe-base is set up... I want some guns. Oh - the small constructor can only produce pew-pew sentry turrets. Well, the small constructor can build a bigger constructor. I build it - and wham, it's too big for my inventory. Yep. Can't take it out of the crate. I have to link to the container, drag-and-drop the constructor into my linked quickslots. Okay. I switch to drone - and the quick-slots are from my own inventory again. Thanks, game. I switch to linked quickslots again and put down the constructor. I unlink from the container so I have my own quickslots again, and build a couple 'projectile turrets.'
And whoops, my CPU power is almost maxed. 
My piece of concrete in the dirt is holding a generator, a small fuel tank, two cargo boxes, a small and a big constructor, an ammo box and two gun turrets... and my CPU power is almost maxed. At this point, I lose all motivation to add the barest necessities still needed (medical chamber, clone chamber, food processor, fridge) because this CPU crap is bugging me out.
Alt+F4 fixed the issue, an uninstall made the solution permanent.

Also; the build module is great to build any vehicle/base you want! Still, the variety I talk about below is still a little light. However, every other game out there to date also has this same problem too sadly and I have played all of them now as of mid 2022.   So it's more attractive until something better comes along.  Biggest flaw still:  The units of measure for speed and distance is what we use here on planet Earth and it's just ridiculous to use here in-game. Why; because it's immersion killing and makes the game feel small on planets and in inter-solar space.  That needs to be fixed or use a fake unit of measurement!   I'm sorry, but these planets are not a few Kilometers in diameter! Nor are the planetary bodies a few Km apart either, jeez! And speed values ""Used here"" on the ground and in-space would be at snails pace.  (You can't just shut this out of your mind, unless your a pre-schooler and never drove/flown or traveled anywhere yet, LOL!)      Old post:   I really wanted to like this game, it struck me at first as a superior space exploration/survival game compared to others out there I played like No Man's Sky, etc. And there is a lot to like here for sure.  Problem is, like most all other similar games out there, they all suffer from lack of variety!  You're supposedly traveling the entire galaxy here; some other games, the entire universe and all these games including this one fall horribly short on content.  My backyard has more interesting diversity than all these games combined!  They all are good for about 2 weeks worth of play then move on. So sad, after you think how many hundreds of hours go into development. After visiting a small handful of planets, they start to look the same.  (Here, only around a half-dozen variants.) Too few creatures to view/shoot at, (Maybe a dozen or less creatures/monsters in total in this entire game.)  Intelligent races= Tiny and you can count the list on 1 hand.  A tiny list of raw materials to gather/mine plus about half are fictional.  (Can a Dev. please look at the periodic table of elements for once in their lives; spend just one night researching products and what their base elements are and put in a bleeping game, please?  If you used just a small fraction of the elements that really exist in the universe, it would blow away every past and present ""Gathering/mining"" game ever created!  Plus maybe a gamer might learn something too, ha, ha.)  By the way, this game is useful for the beginner and wanna-be engineer when you turn on the mass/volume option and you build your ships; very nice feature, by the way. But where was I:  Small list of usable equipment with only 1-2 variations.  Small list of refined material block types to build your bases and ships with.  Not even Titanium as an option????  Fictional elements yes, but only one fictional alloy with material requirements from dead Alien corpses, LOL!  Small numbers of this and small numbers of that throughout this game, it all turns into repetitive boredom and a grind. Speaking of grind, if you don't use the easy access development mode options to grab a stack of food and fuel, you end up in early game spending a huge amount of time, too much in my opinion mining and gathering consumable resources for food, fuel and air!  (It's a survival game but ""No water"" is needed to drink.  I guess in the future, we don't need that anymore, ha, ha, ha! But we can make air with it here!)  I hated leaving anything turned on in base, in my hovercraft, or on my small space ship because in early game I was not an explorer, I was a glorified gas station attendant/gas refiner/miner just keeping my equipment powered up. And that was just to run the fridge inside them so my perishable items did not turn into mold, LOL!  Turning on my shields, firing weapons; oh no, I was all stressed out!  At that point I was praying to the Empyrion Gods to send me down some robot helpers, LOL!   I was excited to go through and complete main story missions and to see where it would lead but felt let down by the short abrupt non-conclusive end to it.  Which is the theme to this whole game:  Great start of a game that is left unfinished and too short of features to be worthy of a ""Good"" space explorer/survival piece of work here.  The one thing I really enjoyed though:  Building your own ships and base.  A nice robust build module within this game and some real talent has built some very fine works of art that are downloadable in the workshop if that is your preference.   In the end, by the time I built my large capital vessel for longer range space travel, there was nothing else left to do, nothing new to explore, no greater story or mystery to unravel. Therefore I loaded up my ship with my smaller vessel creations, emptied out the land base I called home for the last hundred gaming hours or so and lifted off the planet.

Occasionally your base will come under attack by an alien race called The Zirax and they will try to take your base from you by capturing your base core - a special block that sets you as the owner of the structure.  It can be quite exciting but tonight I learned the hard way that they don't actually need to get to your core to take your base.  They simply need to be stood next to any block, including a wall or that solar panel you have 100ft away and can use a ""remote hacking tool"" to gain access to the core from there.  This makes base design pointless.  Don't bother with walls - they're just more blocks that they can use to hack you.

I ended up trapped in my own base that I no longer controlled and lost access to everything I owned in the blink of an eye through what would appear to be shoddy game design rather than clever AI.

Yeah, despite the removal of the ""Early Access"" label, this game is definitely still in the alpha/beta stages.

Space engineers is more technical but gets boring to people who want to do more then build. No Mans Sky is beautiful, but feels childish in comparison.

 I play every game like this that pops up; none of them have ever compared to Empyrions origional base game. As other devs throw half assed concepts at us, this game just keeps developing. Throw in an extensively modded professionaly run server like ""W.A.G"".... and the debate is simply over.

Walking around the starting planet I saw 50 farms and two other POIs on the entire planet. Each farm has 2-3 NPCs, of which only one will talk to you and just say ""go talk to someone else."" That's it. This has gotten better after seeing a lot more areas, and there are occasionally some ""dungeon-like"" POI's. But typically only one POI in a given system is worth investigating. 

Base and ship management is very annoying. When placing down structures you can't access them directly, you have to open a control panel to access things, and in MP only one person can have a given container, equipment, or the very panel itself open at once. Placing down the max number of solar panels for my base, with max output, it still can't run just the lights through the night. So you will never have a self-sufficient base in any way. 

When downloading blueprints (which I would expect most people to do) you better hope that the thing you're building works. If it doesn't, you're completely out those resources. Salvaging blocks nets you back at best 10% return. It is imperative you test blueprints in creative.

I would say this game is NMS-lite. It has a very similar early gameplay loop of just hunting resource after resource after resource, and building a small ship, then getting the next size, etc. But once you get past that, there's not much else. 

This game has been fun with my friend, but given the amount of bugs and glitches we encounter daily I can't recommend it at $20. Only on sale. Every-other time I open my inventory the drop/trash slots are bugged out. Waypoints randomly disappear/reappear. No names over other players' heads. Terrain respawns in your base.

There are games within games here.  I have spent most of my time ""Surviving"", crashing on a system, building up and then getting ready to head into space.. With the new updates, that ""Heading into space"" becomes a galactic adventure that can be what you the player chooses.   Follow the story line, or just explore the galaxy.. of hundreds maybe thousands of star *systems*.  

In my current play through, I elected to follow the Story line... and holy crap.. wow!!    Intriguing and interesting.   I see that the ""story will end"" but.. that again is only another beginning...

No kidding, this game is a 1000 hour adventure easy.   I can say that in my current run, 40-60 hours is just learning to survive, then building a base, then exploring other worlds in the starting solar system for another 50 hours of exploration.  Then.. the game really begins.   

Honestly if you are seeing a review by anyone with less than 200 hours into this game they have not played it. 

Can it be more polished? Yes.  
Could the writing be better? Yes. However the story...Grade A
Are there small sound glitches? Yes, but they do not break the game.
Are there small graphical stutters at times? Yes, but again, they do not break the game or immersion.
The good news, it appears that these developers are working on these issues.

To all the negative whining reviews out there:  This is a terrible race car game.  It does not have the smooth immersion that you see from a Rockstar games such as Grand Theft Auto that cost 500 Million to develop.  It is a pretty poor city simulator and it sucks as a WWII game.    Celebrate what these dedicated developers have accomplished with the resources they have at their disposal.

Game play wise, it's ok, not great, not terrible. Survival is basic, and exploration is ok at best.

The art style/assets is were the game suffers the most. It feels like an asset flip at times, the substance of the gameplay can't come near enough to make me not look at everything and go, ""How much did they get this asset for, free?"" Dinos on alien worlds, aliens that are generic and a UI that is unimaginative. And Dinos on alien worlds? Come on, that's really lazy even if place holders for now.

Building, creative is interesting, survival it's a pain. The best part is to build something in creative and use the ""factory"" to make it in the player inventory, it's a nice concept, however also detracts from the survival/builder genre feel.

I mean I started on Skillon, and the ambiance was non stop cicada buzzing and a wolf howling in the distance, along with the constant 5 second cycle of Geiger counter chirps.
at least the background hum of the survival tool sounds somewhat intentional.

I encountered several areas of clear terrain, that you WILL fall through, that is unless you hit the area with the resource gatherer, to regenerate the terrain. Cuz the first generation didn't quite work out did it?

Not only was my crash pod hovering in the air, so was my obelisk... Its core, fuel tank, and generator underneath on display, You know how to fix this? you make the structure's foundation deeper and sink it into the ground properly.

I bought this game years ago, and today I find a lot of BS bugs and poor design, that I was not expecting. I had hoped this game would have gotten better, and it hasn't. You had me at the vast galaxy, but you failed me with stupid simple systems that..

You most certainly did take the easy way out of..

It's poor sound recordings, and terrible salvage mechanics got real old. Admin cores? Invincible blocks, really. Like the POI's are that important, If you don't want us getting something free, or breaking something, Like the obelisks for example, completely surround the core.

Collection point, Here's a maze to the core, but you cant destroy it.. Cant let you have a free generator or fuel tank.. 

And the large amounts of wrecks littered around Skillon, not worth looting the single item left in its cargo box, BUT NO you can't have a pitiful amount of iron its made of. I would only salvage the whole thing to remove its worthless blip from my map.

Pros: Expansive universe, basically the whole universe is a sandbox, you can make lots of cool looking ships ranging from hover vessels, small vessels, capital vessels all built by you from scratch or you can use prefabs, explore tons of weird locations.

Cons: Can be really buggy at times not so much game breaking bugs but lose hours of progress bugs, universe feels a bit static, not much changes and faction ships just sort of go on patrol routes and thats it, really bad optimization and has a ton of issues with fps.

I still however absolutely recommend the game because despite its cons I think it's pretty fun, otherwise i wouldnt have spent 200 hours in the game.

Take the building mechanics of Space Engineers, minus the more advanced mechanical blocks (e.g. no rotors, hinges, or pistons here), and throw in a much, much greater focus on survival and exploration. That's basically what you get going into this game as you start stranded on a planet/moon and work your way up to building your own space faring vessels capable of jumping between stars and galaxies. There even seems to be a main story, though I haven't progressed along it all that much as I've been too busy visiting star systems and planets for materials to build my own massive ship. Plenty of POIs to explore and PvE encounters to be had, and while the combat does have some jank and there are a few limits on what you can build, it's still a pretty good time.

My gripes with hovercraft come primarily from using them to mine ores - using them for regular land travel is fine. I'm not sure if I'm just designing my vessels wrong or if this is a shared sentiment among the community (I've only played single player), but using hovercraft to mine has been one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had with virtual vehicles. Getting stuck on some protruding piece of stone feels like it happens every minute, and if you can't wiggle your way out, then you have to hop out of your miner and manually mine it with a hand drill, and that's assuming you didn't make the mistake of digging a hole too steep to traverse on foot. My advice - as soon as you can, ditch the hovercraft for a Small Vessel with mining lasers, which is a much smoother excavation experience. Again, other than the mining, the hovercraft actually feel pretty cool to ride around on and use.",1502063166,1657326806,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
383120,118479318,76561198262712135,82,13,9508,0,5579,1662136637,"I never heard of this game until update 1.8, which was when it started appearing in my recommended feed on Steam. I was hesitant to pick the game up at $20 seeing some of the reviews mention glaring issues, however the overall experience I've had has been phenomenal.

A word of caution before I go into more detail: this game is prone to bugs and crashes, make sure you backup your save data regularly.

To start of, the one aspect this game excels at is the sense of exploration. The system for generating structures utilizes a blueprint system wherein both players and Eleon can assign a ""POI"" to it for the game to have a chance of spawning in. Essentially this creates near infinite replayability as each game you create will always be unique as you explore a vast range of structures. A key point to understand though is certain structures spawning are contingent on the planet type, thus requiring you to explore the galaxy in order to experience every one of them.

Planets are also pseudo random generated in the sense that specific planet types are governed by the type of star system. For example, ocean and ice planets won't spawn in star systems with a high heat output and lava planets won't spawn in low heat systems. The amount of light a planet receives is also affected by the luminosity of the star, so if you set up camp near a neutron star you can expect to receive very little light from it.

Luminosity has little impact on gameplay as the only object affected by it is solar panels. Surprisingly planets do have a day/night cycle caused by the planet itself spinning rather than the approach some games take by having the sun orbit the planets. This means any space station constructed with fixed solar panels will have an infinite source of solar power.

Empyrion utilizes a blocked based building system with two sizes. Hover vessels and small vessels utilize the smaller block set while capital vessels and bases utilize the large block set. Despite the limitations of a block based building system the vast array of block shapes at your disposal and a deco block system means the only limitation is your creativity. It is entirely possible to recreate iconic ships such as the Normandy from Mass Effect or the Tachi from The Expanse, if you have the time and patience to do so.

One final pro to note is the integration of the Steam Workshop into the game. Eleon fully understand that the primary reason behind Empyrion's success is the dedicated community releasing some of the most intricate and power creations on the workshop. This is supported by the ability to outright spawn in blueprints by providing enough resources rather than needing to follow a hologram guide in recreating the design. If you have the time, definitely check out some of the creations from Artemis and Spanj.

Now onto the issues with the game...

As noted in several other reviews Empyrion lacks the necessary polish required for a game in a full release stage. This is evident by the mess that is the PDA system which contains: inventory, quest logs, local map, system map, galaxy map, codex information, blueprints, and the tech tree. The most egregious entry is the quest system as the overall formatting is reminiscent of early 2000s design. In time you'll learn to navigate the PDA effectively, however it's in desperate need of a redesign.

Another issue becomes evident as you advance through missions. The implementation is rather rudimentary as each step in a mission can and will break if you fail to pass the highly constrained trigger. In some instances a mission might completely break or repeat itself regardless of actions taken by the player. Eleon have even acknowledge the missions are an issue by allowing players to debug complete steps so at the very least you can complete a broken mission.

Animations and sound are areas in dire need of an overhaul as well since both lack depth and complexity we'd expect as standard for games in 2022. The sound system especially appears to only be 4 or 5 layers deep with frequent cutting the more densely packed the area you're in is. Animations tend to break often as well or are lazily implemented as you'll soon see when encountering your first NPC.

The overall graphics and models are mediocre at best with both having a mixture of high and low quality. The graphics are of the same quality as games released in the early 2000s with low res textures completely dominating your attention over the few high res textures. Hitbox models also rarely line up with the actual textures meaning you'll frequently hit blocks with your weapons despite have a clear line of sight.

Other issues include the rather simplistic AI, poor weapon integration, inconsistent difficulty, inconsistent rendering (hello random trees), basic multiplayer framework, extremely basic economy, and an unintuitice tutorial.



To sum everything up, Empyrion is a diamond in the rough that is consistently being updated and improved. For an indie game studio Eleon have produced a game that I feel provides a better experience than some AAA titles released in the past year.

Overall I'd recommend fans of the sci-fi genre to definitely pick this game up. While fairly rough at the time of publishing this review its definitely worth adding to your collection and seeing what Eleon is capable of doing.",1657323333,1657323333,True,76,0,0.87345588207244873,0,True,False,False

There is a few good things i would like to highlight about this game:
Community creations, and general art of things like stations, ships, LCDs, furniture, the way NPCs look (both humanoid and monster kind), planetary environments look artistic too. Multiplayer is also good.

the building and ship stuff is great, but the NPC's are so unbelievably bad. Honestly I think the game was better when there were very few NPC's and basically no combat. Felt a bit lifeless but that was better than it is now

The NPC's are such a joke, you either can just walk up to them and shoot them over and over until they die with basically no fight, like not even moving or looking at you, or they are extremely overpowered, never miss a shot and just kill you right away.

The strange thing is that the drone and animal AI is not too bad, but for some reason the human like NPC's on foot are just a total joke, i don't know why.

The developers just kept adding features like crazy, looks good in a screenshot i guess, but nothing is polished at all. for example you can see complex ships in space now, and if you look in the windows you can see people. but if you shoot out he windows and go inside the people are basically just blocks placed in the ship. they don't react to the ship losing O2, don't react to being shot, nothing. like what's the point of even adding people to the ships? obviously players are going to go inside and be disappointed with what they find, feels more lifeless with the people blocks than if you just treated the whole ship as unmanned

if you just like spaceship building then maybe give the game a try, start on a barren planet with as few npc's as possible, might have a good time",1657155333,1657155333,False,4,0,0.492239236831665039,0,True,False,False

You have survival (in space), a plethora of starting options, a surprisingly detailed and consequential shipbuilding, ability to create bases, hovercrafts, small vessels and capital vessels and basically explore space. And shoot spiders.

I had many adventures in the game, playing solo (twice) and in co-op. At first, I was intimidated by the base creation process (it is complex), same went with designing any functional air and hovercraft. It is surprisingly complex up to and including balancing your actual mass, covering for cargo, securing place for storage, and providing thrust in all 6 physical 3D directions (or as in case of hovercrafts, 4). This is turn transfers to the vessel's maneuvrability in space, how it accelerates in each direction, how well it yaws, etc. Designing something that flies smoothly and then piloting it feels really awesome.

Your ships really grow on you. When the first one I piloted was literally blasted in half in orbit (each block receives damage on its own), that felt. My current capital ship, as it looks (it's a light cruiser), feels so personal and as an achievement. I admit it took me seeing a tutorial or two about building. There is a galaxy map with factions, and you even meet 4 of them on your starting planet. Your relationship with them is dynamic and exlusive up to some point. There is also a story. Ahem.

And now we come to bad things. Story... and its presentation... is not a gem. The story itself is pretty much cliche and forgettable, but okay, this is a survival game first and foremost. The problem is, quests can sometimes get bugged to the point that the game literally has an option to skip them and mark them as checked for the most part. This is something I've never seen in a completed game, to be honest. Though you will appreciate this functionality if you play the game...

The graphics. I think planets, moons, etc. look cool. Ships look cool, for the most part. NPCs and their animations do not. I get this is a Unity game, but it's just not very aesthetic. Though, I can safely say that it didn't bother me very much when I played the game. What did bother me though, was a couple of other things.

The game has a problem with some annoying map marker/waypoint glitches. I was warned not to leave the waypoints while leaving the starting system and oh boy how warranted that was. Now I get a literal black unreadable label (because all the waypoints from the starting system blend into one) that will not go away unless I go back and remove them. This feels... extremely glitchy, and is very annoying. I have also experienced some slight glitches with locking on suns in the systems (and this is important as you must jump to the central sun first to jump to any other star).

As for building, it's incredible how many things can you do with it. You can choose from many shapes, which you can then use to create some complex designs. You can rotate and paint bricks. So yes, no ""cosmetic DLC packs"" here! Problems begin when you discover that choosing shapes can be tricky and time consuming, as you cannot for example check the shape of any block in the game in a current design. This quality of life function is not available. Good luck trying to search for a particular block with the ""trial and error"" method, as you must also include rotations. It could take up to an hour per block.

I also discovered one very peculiar thing when I finally finished my capital vessel. So... you cannot fire most of the capital vessel weapons in planet's atmosphere for... balance reasons. Uh huh. This doesn't apply to NPCs, and makes your freshly built, expensive (in terms of resources and gameplay time) spaceship feel toothless. Fortunately, you can mod your game to correct this flaw. I didn't invest 50 hours in my spaceship so it is just a flying toothpick, thank you very much. Please learn what ""accomplishment"" and ""reward"" means.

====== Update =======
Time to update my review of EGS. I stepped away from the game for a while to reset the feeling and understanding of the game. For those curious with my familiarity with the game. I bought the game a few months after it was posted on Steam.. so I have been playing it a long time… I am sitting at just under 4,000 hrs.  The group I ran with (Obsidian Order) ruled the Official US server for 3 rotations/seasons.. whatever you want to call it. My first review was in 2018 which I waited a fairly long time to post because I am a HUGE sci-fi space fan and I wanted to give it a fair assessment. I have a ton to say about this but I will only hit the high points, I wish I could convey all my thoughts on the issue.

The game is in final release and I feel its time to update. I am judging this from the perspective of the US Server as it is an Official look at the game as the developers intended and not my private server. I have also included some comments from creative mode – which is also essential to any player wanting to make a serious go for it in this game.

Art/Look and Feel – 
Good - The graphics in the game are stunning and very pretty to look at. I am very impressed with the progress they have made. The over feel of the game allows you to immerse yourself in the game and it feels like a good space sim complete with planetary/space transitions. By far one of my favorite features in the game. Resources are easy to determine what they are from visual inspection. The environmental effects are very good, I love the weather effects.

Bad – The game still has several graphic anomalies. When placing a base I have to clear rocks, trees and plants from my base every server restart (2am and 10pm for my time zone). The water effects I think went from underwhelming originally to overboard. I have seen some crazy effects in creative mode and a lot of times it obscures the camera if I go below the ground to inspect underground structures. For the live server this is not really an issue. The weather effects still can be a little heavy on the haze, also it is not the easy to determine if the stuff failing outside your base is Hail, Snow, or whatever. Since some weather effects can damage you its kind of important to know which is which. Also just standing under a ship or base structure does not shield you from the effects.. something that did not happen in pre-alpha.

NPCs-
Good – They have added a good variety of NPC’s to look at and it seems they are still making some strides in this area. The multiple factions was a much needed improvement and it has added a diversity to the game I wish it had when my group was playing it heavily. The scanner is a nice feature that we did not have in the pre-alpha. Being able to scan for asteroids in space use to be a major pain in the butt, but I personally liked it. It was like an easter egg hunt in space. You either spent a lot of time looking for one or talking with other players on where the resources were at. For PVPer’s it let you know where your prey was going to be >:)

Bad – Watching mobs zig zag and rubber banding around as the mobs are chasing you is not only annoying but kills the immersion. Any time a mob wants to make a comment at the player – it is weird dialogue box that cause the game to stutter which the players actions are inhibited but the mobs is not… I just do not have words for that. Please get rid of them for now. In space I had several occasions where the enemy NPC ship teleported 1.5-2.0km and started blasting me. I lost a ton of resources not to mention my ship. This will frustrate new players. IN the same instances where I was getting jumped by teleporting starships, I also noticed that they were not being labeled by the scanner. It would list the Nemesis cruiser that was 9-10km away but not the one 3km away. I had to do visual tracking and place my aim point on the ship itself to ID it and see the distance.

Crafting- This one is near and dear to my heart. I am a huge fan of crafting systems and always have a ton of things to say on them.
Good –The crafting in EGS is fairly decent, although I did prefer a lot of it from pre-alpha. Adding additional resource types was nice, I like it when you have to gather a few things together to make most things. I do like the crossover between a few structure and food crafting, I think that was a clever move on the devs part. 

Bad – I prefer some of the food crafting from pre-alpha. The generic veggies, fruits and sweeteners kind of washed it out for me. I like have a purpose to grow different foods and harvest different foods for a reason. Not look through the timers and figure out how I should arrange my garden to make MRE’s because it is the only food really worth keeping around. Gun crafting is still kind of all over the place. I think the devs still need a lot of work on the crafting but to give them credit where it is due, EGS crafting system is still a lot better than several other games so do not let this discourage you.

Combat – This is the other subject near and dear to my heart. Being a retired Combat Veteran and PVP player this is the next thing behind crafting systems that I judge the most.
Good – The game has it. EGS has a nice variety of weapons to choose from. They added pop up turrets on ships which add the “HAHA I am not unarmed sucker” factor to the game which can quickly turn the prey into the hunter. I love the starship fights and the person to person combat is fairly decent as well.

Bad – As mentioned before the teleporting and rubber-banding is a huge let down in this department, I mentioned it again here because it really does ruin the feel.  The armor system is a little lacking as are the defensive options. In pre-alpha the defensive option was offline protection which got abused pretty much constantly. Now it is shields, which was a good idea, but the execution I feel missed the mark. At the games current state most players will not use builds without shields. I do because it is cost effective and a lot of dull day to day functions do not need them, and I can either escape or blow up. Generally speaking my ships are cheap to make, I do not use prefabs, I do not like them. It must be said however, I enjoy hunting JRandall ships the most. That guy can make a pretty ship. His are one of the few I do use.

Game Overall – I would like to put all of my comments in here, but it would be a novel. 
Good – the game is playable and has stunning visuals. If you like to play solo or with a few friends on a private server this game is great. Despite the issues the game has, I feel it is still a good game and worth the $19 that folks pay to get it.

Bad – The official servers still suck. They have horrible lag issues, the PVP is horrible especially on the US server.. They have basically one cluster of zones to do PVP in and there is no point in going there… at all. In previous versions of the game all the good resources were in the PVP sectors. Now the PVE players can build massive cities that have no purpose and cannot be removed.. which leads to the server bogging down. This sadly has not changed since pre-alpha and I feel the devs have let the players down horribly here. The need to put the same level of effort they put in visuals to functionality and optimization. I still see most of the issues I talked with the Admins about in 2018 popping up today. I have had 5 deaths alone teleporting to a friendly station to sell some junk to vendors.",1542911762,1656774459,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

- Movement is pretty rough. Becoming stuck on rocks while trying to speed across the planet on the motorbike is deeply frustrating. Even walking and trying to stop and gather often fails the first time. Yes you have to stop to gather. No stopping doesn't always work when you want it to.

- UI is pretty rough. The info screens are kind of random piles of information. And the tutorials, when they aren't ""coming soon!"", are just awkward walls of text literally on top of all that.

- Speaking of tutorials, you really need some because the game systems are complex and impossible to deduce from trial and error. But the tutorials that exist are badly presented, being a big paragraph at a time that can't be seen while doing anything else. And if multiple text events are going on, most of them clobber each other. It tries to tell you where to find missed messages, which requires you to disengage and find that in the menu, disrupting the flow of the game.

- Building things. Unless you can afford stuff in blueprints, It goes block by block. Each block can (must be) rotated among the 3 axes to fit right. If you mess something up, it costs you resources to fix. At least until you get better building tech. It's too tedious. Having bad lighting conditions most times of the day doesn't help. The ""cube based"" building grid means nothing can be placed next to a thin wall because thin wall takes up the whole cubical space. I know other games do this, but it makes building frustrating.

- Quests. The quests I was given by the locals amounted to easy fetch quests. If the environment was more atmospheric it might not be so bad, instead it's a boring task involving buggy movement.

- Survival. Once you decipher the UI enough to make a basic bar from plants, survival is trivial. Space and other planets might not have free breathable air, making survival less trivial, but I can't imagine that making the initial experience better. Combat on the starter moon is basically avoidable. Which is good because your basic weapons are very weak. The combats that I did do amounted to firing 30 pistol shots at an enemy that seemed to be stuck and ended up not being a threat.

Maybe there is a lot more to Empyrion once you can get past all these issues. Clearly a lot of work went into the game as a whole. The movement and UI issues and tutorials could probably be fixed in the future. The graphics could be improved but honestly that's not nearly as important.",1656532197,1656532384,False,7,1,0.594345390796661377,0,True,False,False

There is content in the game that feels stale, ground combat doesnt feel complete and the motorbike feels clunky. There are gaps in in-game information which makes players tediously look up or trial and error things that should be better conveyed in-game.

Game glitches and bugs are rampant, I stopped playing for a very long time and came back just to get my play slammed by a bug I remember happening years ago which tanked my entire experience. 

This leads me to my main gripe about the game, they leave things unfinished for literal years and direct their energy on less necessary aspects like graphics. There are posts from people who were playing the game around when it came out complaining about significant bugs which still exist in the game to this day. There are countless people who play often that bring up mechanics that have needed adjustments or an overhaul to make them more enjoyable for years and yet these things that the player base bring up are never looked into.

I can't recommend this game at this point in time. I can only say be careful supporting them could lead to unfinished product. I might change my thought's on them in the future if they start to listen to real feed back. I really want this game to do really well, theirs so much that could be done and add like more types of npcs creatures on planets, more types of plant life, better sound effects, creatures should seem more alive, some creatures should be feared and for the love of god enough with adding poi's, add more real content to the game make it seem more alive. Might change my view of this game until then NO     

    New Review-  OK so I came back to this game again and love what they did with plant life and new rocks in the game, the water is sick, but the game still remains lacking npcs and they also need to work on creatures movements as well, make them more natural. The t-rex still doesn't attack, why??? if your not going to use the t-rex remove it for the game, plus all it does is walk back in forward, why not give it more paths to follow through the forest and out into the opening to attack other creatures an the player?? But anyways the game is improving in some aspect, but please update your steam page with new screen shots and with the new trailer, people can't see it on your main steam page unless you go to updates page, please fix this!!! it will help sell the game better, plus put the song in the new trailer in the main menu screen, would spice things up a bit. If your going to have conveys in the game on the ground make them moving hover vessels actual moving base to base would help bring the game to life some. And maybe a few ships actual landing on the planet coming and going. Enemy hover vessels would be nice to encounter as well. But I see you added a few new npcs now which is cool, its definitely a start but we need more threats and harassing enemies, add a new bio-me with luminescent plants at night would be cool, keep them coming y'all are on to something here, don't let us down but for now review stays the same, I would say support them yes at this point yes.

Why did I write negative feedback even though I have been spending so much time in this game?
The game enjoyed the fact that here you can build your own bases, build a variety of ships, with the help of which you can fight all kinds of creatures and other players.
Your strength and abilities depend on your creativity - you can build vessels or bases better than other players  and fought successfully against others ...
Everything would be fine, but the biggest problem of the game - a million BUGs - all sorts of lags, snags, falling off planes, teleportation problems, etc.
All these mistakes are known to the creators, but over time they remain the same - the creators are not able to correct them. Everything they do - changes the texture, the appearance of the thing ...
Due to these errors, you will not be able to play the game without the help of someone from the outside who created the game. So, in case of any bug, you have to write a ticket for help,
or ask help to a incompetent moderator in the game who doesn't help, just tells you to fill out a bug report. As long as there was no this moderator with name TSM, I was able to contact developer TAELYN (or whoever he is) through Discord, which helped perfectly and quickly solved all the problems always. All you had to do was have patience and it was still possible to play with teeth closed.
 But later some moderator TSM appeared, he does not play the role of a helper, he only watches as a policeman who speaks what and in what language. He forbade speaking Russian and blocked disobedient players. It is funny and strange when in global chat it is allowed to speak English, it is not forbidden to speak German, and Russian is given a ban. After all, Russian is spoken not only by Russians, but also by Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Greeks, Romanians, Jews, Moldovans and  etc.  When I called him (moderator TSM) incompetent, in one game discussion, it all started ... 
  Once, when I had a fight VS another player in the PVP zone, the player started writing, that I'm attacking him in wrong manera. Apparently the player with moderator TSM was friends that the moderator told me not to attack that player and told me - that I'm breaking the server... I have hundreds of battles with all kinds of players and until then no one said I was breaking the server, and now TSM has come up with its own news.
 Clearly I ignored their demands, then someone started out of invisible guns to bomb my CV. 
More, I couldn't play on the official EU server before this last 1.8... update -
 the teleportation problem was the biggest problem - one time from 3-5 tries of teleportation, the teleportation did not take place and I found myself somewhere in space ... So I can't play that sesion on official servers (vanilla, EU).
So I decided to wait, I hoped the developers would fix the teleportation bug.
After last 1.8.1 updated, in new sesion (EU server) I faced the first big problem - annoying connection problems with server + stucks... Taelyn explained - becouse of a lot of players. 42 players on server is a LOT?  Although there is a problem with 20 players. 
Second, I was simply attacked from nowhere even in the PVE areas. First of all, appeared in the ""ether"" TSM. He writed something to a someone in the chat. Then my CV left at the POI, in PVE playfield was bombed out of nowhere when i was inside this POI. I was looting in this POI that was without core. Therefore, no one from this base could shoot. So I checked with radar for enemy ship. There was no one enemy ship, but the shooting lasted until the my CV core was blown up. 
I wrote to the moderator about it. He just laughed and told me to fill out this “bug""  ticket. 
  The next and final case for my patience - I was killed inside a POI. POI was without core, I was looting when moderator TSM in global chat writed somthing like - come and see inside...  No one was talking to anyone in the global chat at this time. It was definitely meant for me. And just when I landed at a lowest POINT level there happened a explode and killed me. I always play with 0 deaths. Maybe they decided to make me nervous...  
When I in Discord wrote to Taelyn about it, Taelynas answered me - where is the evidence? Haha, He asked me evidence, when he can see everything... So now I think even TAELYN, the game's creator, could have done it.
  I decided to end it all and I would not advise anyone to deal with this sh*t.",1562435545,1656270513,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

""My name is @Taelyn and I can't take criticism so I perma-ban people from threads, haha, im such a clown"" --Taelyn 2022, Empyrion dev.

Empyrion devs flagged my post talking about how they never listen to their community, as ""disrespectful"" when I never said anything offensive. I simply stated the truth. They don't listen to their community, and they will remove criticism because they can't take it.

Ladies and gentlemen, the Empyrion devs! give them a round of applause! 

It makes me furious that I made the effort to get their game, play it, enjoy it, and as soon as I make ONE... O N E COMMENT that criticises the fact they never listen to their community, they remove my comment. How sad. 

Well, now I am definitely not getting back into this game again. Shame, it has good potential but I don't want a game in my library that's owned by snowflake devs, 

Taelyn doesn't respect the playerbase of their game. Deleting criticism that talks about how they don't listen to their community. I never said anything disrespectful or offensive. I simply aired my frustration on the fact Empyrion devs blatantly ignore the community of their game, and removes comments that they find too unfavourable... sounds a bit like a dictatorship if I'm honest.

Doesn't matter to me anymore. I got this game for free, so i won't miss out much by removing it from my library. I don't want ownership of a game that's run by dictator developers that are against rights of free speech.

Hope you're happy Taelyn. Your game has died massively, your player count is dropping fast. and the negative reviews are starting to add up. Only you are to blame

Don't get me wrong, its fun if you enjoy gathering materials and crafting, shaping the world around you. No, why I can't recommend the game is the save feature, quitting the game autosaving over your last save and the game automatically compressing saves or deleting earlier saves or whatever that happened that made me lose multiple saves, multiple times since I started playing, oh and falling through the ground. It starts off with you walking along, or ""swimming"" looking for fishies (for a quest) and materials under water, then poof, you fall, take fall damage under water and teleport in the air and fall again, taking damage when you hit the water AND when you hit the hole in the ground. Rinse & Repeat until death (jetpack doesn't help when this happens). The game offers you choices of where to respawn, then it saves the game, you try to load an old save (which means quitting to main menu which also saves the game over your last save file). Now somewhere between both of those times, you lose your previous saves, which if you aren't saving every 10 minutes manually, it can really cost you. Today, I lost 2 hours, twice. Then when trying to get back on (resuming play/loading the save), it lost the save that was a 2 hour loss of gameplay. I'm back almost 4 hours in the hole now and hate the fact I bought the game, even on sale. This seems to be a running theme (complaint) since 2016 (or earlier).

If you like farming mats, this is your game. If you like in depth crafting/building, this is your game. If you DON'T like feeling frustrated due to bugs and wasting your time playing the game due to said bugs or poor game mechanics (hello leave the save files alone and give an autosave feature that saves to its own autosave file, not too difficult, its tried and true!)... then STAY AWAY from Empyrion - Galactic Survival.",1656232811,1656232811,False,7,1,0.539771437644958496,1,True,False,False

POST-EDIT REVIEW:

Yeah, the devs just can't seem to settle on a direction for the ""story"" part of the game. Not only that, they can't seem to settle on base mechanics or very simple features of their base engine.

This last update seems to have made the game virtually unplayable, and this is coming as a veteran who is very used to the usual bugs and unaddressed quirks that the game has become known for. The bugs and quirkiness has simply and sadly been taken to 11...

Get it while it's on sale, and good luck grinding to space.

I'm still going to give it a positive review, even after a few years of waiting for this game to fully evolve, simply because I keep going back to it.

Positives:  
- The 'world' is big. very big.  Played for a few days and fully explored your planet? good for you, now go up into space and explore your planetary system. Got that covered? Great, go explore your solar system. Done? Here's a cookie, now go explore any of the hundreds of other systems and planets and moons and asteroid bases and space stations in the galaxy.  There's a lot to explore, even if some of it may get a little repetitive after thousands of hours played.
- And this is the biggest one for me, personally. The building system. Ground and space structures, hover craft, air/space ships. So much freedom to be creative with block shapes and decorations and design components. Most of these build games have pre-made modules you fit together, or some kind of pre-designed progression of designs. Not in Empyrion. You design and build it block by block, component by component.  And then you can save it for future plays, or share in the workshop. The Workshop has some amazing creations by other players.
- The Base/Vessel design system is so good, I'm going to give it a second entry.  Specifically, Design For Purpose.  Unlike certain similar games in the genre, in Empyrion you build things for specific purposes, and use them. Whether it is for dealing with the Environment, NPC Combat (Survival). PvP, or purely aesthetic, your creations need function before form. You will spend days building something, test it against an enemy faction or harsh planet or for resource gathering, then make tweaks or redesign the whole thing. In time, you will figure out what works best for each activity, what designs improve your activities and quality of life, etc.  You don't just build it to build it (unless you're pure Creative mode, of course). Once you've got a grasp of your design needs, then you can focus on Form, and get very creative thanks to the flexible build system and block shapes and alternate devices.
- So many ways to play. Creative/Sandbox, Solo survival, Multi-Player Co-op, and PvP.  And it is attractive to builders, Explorers, Combat/Adventure, Story plots, modders, etc. There is something for everyone in it, or can be, with Mods.
- Mods, Workshop items, and community support for Scenarios. As much as you can lose hundreds of hours in plain vanilla, you will find a lot of creative assets from the community. Want a story-driven campaign scenario? Unique planets/geography to explore? Cool ships and hovercraft to use? They exist, and more coming, from fellow players.


The Negatives:
- In a market flooding with more developed open-world/survival/craft/build/exploration games, this one has lagged so far beyond most.  By the time it is fully developed (and it's not, don't let it's Release status fool you, it's still Beta), the genre will be overly saturated and Empyrion will be 5 years behind modern standards/expectations.
- AI, NPC's, and the general environment theme.  It's slowly getting better as they add/replace unique assets and get rid of stock Unity assets that were heavily used in earlier phases, but the World-Building is simply lacking. You're still not quite sure what kind of Universe theme they are going for.   The AI and NPC's are also quite idiotic in pathing and response, and at times it seems like the Devs are compensating for low-quality with quantity and OP weapons at times.  It can be frustrating and takes away from the gameplay.  There should be rewarding Challenge, not annoying roadblocks.
- This is a half-negative. Although there are a number of unique and stunning biomes and environment combinations you will stumble across, there needs to be more...particularly now that the size of the Playfield / galaxy maps have increased so much.  We still need more diversity, particularly alien diversity, on planets. There are too many Earth-like assets being used.
- Nearly non-existent player avatar customization, awkward player movement, questionable weapon usage, combat lag, and general need for optimization of the game.
- And as mentioned, the super slow development. Many of us were expecting them to hire on more help a couple of years ago, to speed it up, but it's still chugging along at the same snail pace. 

Highly recommended if you really like to build bases and ships and hovercraft tanks, as I do.  It does not require high-level math or engineering skills...a little trial and error and maybe looking at workshop examples or Best played as Co-op survival with friends, or Solo Creative/sandbox.",1656195196,1656195549,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

After stumbling around for 3 hours, I was able to activate an obelisk with 4 teleporters in it.  Each went to other environments, and the last one I tried had no oxygen.

This has the full list (well, pretty close) of things I've wanted in a game for decades. A space survival game that isn't too extremely hardcore in the survival aspect (who wants to balance every vitamin they take in?), in which you can build bases, hover-ships, small spaceships, large spaceships, explore planet surfaces, solar systems, the galaxy, with good graphics.. There's a nice selection of wildlife moving believably about their lives on each planet, some aggressive, some not. Humanoids and other intelligent aliens of various factions, a storyline you can either follow or just ignore happily, a great build system that lets your creativity loose on the galaxy. Let's say you want to just make a ship others have made because it's a design you like the looks of, you can download it as a ship blueprint (template) and it will just be auto-built as you get the right resources for it. It also has multiplayer. You can join someone else's persistent server or set up your own, or, if I understand correctly, simply connect into someone's game if you're invited. This will be my main game for quite some time.
What I don't understand is, where has this game been? How have I missed its existence for years?
Edit: I've found something that nearly breaks the game for me. Enemies who fall through the terrain to a plane far below the graphics. You can no longer see them, but they see you, and they can shoot you, and they destroy you and your ships while you can do nothing to stop them, REPEATEDLY. And I wouldn't even bring this up if this were a rare occurence. It happens to me nearly every time I attempt to take over large NPC bases. This needs to be fixed somehow. I'm no dev, but devs, how about making the plane below incredibly hot, so any enemies that fall through get burned up immediately once they land down there? That's just one idea. Think outside the box for a workaround solution until you can come up with a permanent fix. The only way I know to deal with this problem as a player is to go into god mode, ghost down below the terrain until you can see the cheating hostile NPCs and destroy them, then cheat myself another ship and stuff to replace what they've destroyed. That's not fun! That's cheating! And I don't want to cheat. I want to win honestly.",1651237163,1655997186,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

When the game was first started it was quite enjoyable, when I still had the 2005Guyver01 YouTube channel before accidentally deleting it; I covered all versions/updates of/to the game, including bugs, exploits and experimental at the time. I had lot's of fun; but then Elion started listening to those who wanted to make the game more and more difficult and unplayable. When they added shield's and making it none-optional to the game, that is when I started to loose interest. Now, not only were the creatures and enemies being turned into bullet sponges but the buildings to. I was Ok with the thought of having invading enemy troops, but when they added the hacking ability to the enemy (Something we could not do to their buildings) that was the straw that broke the camels back. (I devised ways around that problem)

I have nothing against adding 1 or 2 difficulties to a game, but making an enemy completely OP to the point that you can't be on equal footing, no matter how high your level is and the build limitations to your base, vehicles and blue prints; that's where I draw the line.

I wish Elion luck in the future, but I'm out and find myself unable to support Empyrion in the directions it is going in! (The Toilet)

Edit: 2022/06/23
When I saw the update to version 1.8 my hopes to the game was raised, but then I hit one of the usual problems (Which happens every time they make a huge change to the game; unlike other Dev's I work with who can blame steam having an update at the same time the other games have an update at the same time and the Steam update screws the update to the other games, Elion doesn't have a leg to stand on, there was no steam update and this bug happens every single time)

Yes I've been a volunteer tester for other games, and recently became a Part Time QA Tester; though I still refuse payment: There is no way in HE-- that I'm going to work out the TAX System for 2 - 3 countries! 

Getting back to the update to my review:
I still can't recommend the game to new players, even though the new changes makes the game visually good, the gameplay is worse than ever! The initial starting options mostly the same, the only difference is that the starting planet is small. The thing that will turn off all new/young/old players is the Tutorial. at the time of my initial review ""Feb 2021"" the Tutorial was ok and lead you through the basics; with an option to skip it.

The new tutorial is terrible, not having played the game for a year and starting with the new tutorial I felt confused lost and wanted to go to bed. I can see new players having the same contusion, getting frustrated and refunding the game. 

So as it stands I can't recommend purchasing the game, till Elion clean up their game and make it less confusing at the start! Otherwise they will see a lot of new players requesting a lot of refunds!",1612456994,1655965053,False,11,0,0.508358418941497803,0,True,False,False

If you have NEVER played Empyrion before, do not miss the beautiful new graphics available on the Official Vanilla server. Begin by playing planet Akua and take advantage of the excellent TUTORIAL available to teach you everything you need to know about how to play Empryion.  Although this is a gentle introduction to a game with many personalities, always remember that it is first and foremost A SURVIVAL GAME.  What does that mean? It means, the object of the game is to figure out how to play it WITHOUT EVERYONE feeding you the answers. To get the most satisfaction out of your accomplishments, I strongly suggest you play it single-player for 6 mos.  before playing multiplayer. It is possible to mute the chat on multiplayer but it is too great a temptation.  There is so much to learn and learning how to use the extensive written information at your disposal is key to your ultimate success with Empyrion.  There is a wonderful creative mode that allows you an unlimited supply of material to build any ship you can imagine. And there are many videos on the web that can teach you how to begin. 
1.8 is a major update and if you already know how to play Empyrion then you may wish to try the Defender - Attacker Scenario available on Official US or Official EU. Most of the annoyances of early Empyrion are gone and I think you will find your experience on the 3 Official servers to be an enjoyable experience.
There are also many Reforged Eden scenario  (PVE) customizations available practically everywhere now as well as PVPVE and PVEVP public servers.  See you out there.

I just can't feeel the imersion while seeing my friends teleport around me.

When they do fix the networking issues, I'll gladly jump in and play some long term survival games.

I didn't know anything, went in completely blind. The tutorials are informative but badly structured. At some point I spent 5 minutes to figure out how to access a prior popup message to re-read it just to find out, that it didn't really help because it was referring to something that is not explained at all. Sometimes you still find typos. A game that was 5 years in EA and since 2 years in a released state.
As a new player it can be very overwhelming, because at almost everything you touch or open, a pop-up message will interrupt you to tell you something about it (and that just the crafting tutorials). For example to build your first hover vessel (HV), the game has a multi-step-tutorial, from frame down to the individual parts. Every part you craft gets an individual pop-up message about it's function.

What I really like here, you don't have to build EVERYTHING yourself, as long as you have the resources/components. For example a Core: it needs, among other things, a motor. The motor needs electronic & engineering parts. The parts itself you have to craft from refine items (ingots, plates). Those items are crafted from raw materials (Ore, Fiber) which you have to harvest manually through overland rocks or if you want and need more from underground deposits, which you have to dig up. I assume later on you can craft Mining Vessels or even Mineral Harvesters.
If you have all resources, just select the Core and everything needed to craft it will be put into the crafting queue.

By exploring, harvesting ect. you'll get XP, get level ups, which give you points to unlock new tech (parts) from the tech tree. Tech is locked behind player levels, so the good stuff you will get later, like I don't know, Large Railguns 😄

But to sum up the early game: gather resources, craft stuff, repeat.
Mid game I suppose you build your first Small Vessel (SV) to explore your starting / neighboring system, planetary base, space mining, mission running.
And in Late game huge Capital Vessels (CV), Space Stations, maybe some Faction Warfare?

I can't say anything about the AI because I didn't encounter any in my first 2 hours.

Empyrion really combines many aspects and mechanics from similar games like Space Engineers, No Man's Sky and Elite Dangerous. Engine-wise, maybe not the prettiest up-to-date looking game but the gameplay is definitely there.
I definitely want to explore it more, on my own for now, later on maybe joining a server or even setting up one of my own.
It's an easy-to-learn but hard-to-master kinda deal base on the sheer complexity of the game.

Price: it's worth full price or just wait for a sale. At moment of this review you can get it for 10,- EUR (-50% off) and the next Summer Sale is around the corner.",1655832973,1655832973,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core of the game is the block building system. In between survival, combat and mining you'll be spending a lot of time choosing blocks to make a cool looking base and fleet of ships. Aesthetically, it's probably hands down the best sci-fi block building system around (Dual Universe is technologically superior and will probably surpass it at some point, but not yet). There's an amazing array of block shapes and many textures to choose from, so you're able to create some absolutely stunning space ships and stations if you put the work in. And if you don't have time, you can easily download from a HUGE selection of other people's creations on the game's steam workshop. There's some truly impressive work on there, make sure to have a look.

The block physics aren't quite as good. It doesn't have true moving parts like Space Engineers, although you do get a decent array of working components like lights, sensors, doors, shutters, ramps, docking feet and hangar bay doors. There's no collision damage on ships, however, so things are a bit comical at times.

The worlds are beautiful and interesting for the most part. There's a range of planet types each with a very distinctive look, although in the galaxy mode with 1000s of star systems it suffers from the No Man's Sky problem of things being very samey. But you really only need a handful of planets to keep you occupied for countless hours.

There's a decent array of creatures and races, though perhaps not quite enough, and they lack personality. It's not true what others have said that they are aimbots, although they are fairly accurate and especially without heavy armour you can die if you make a mistake very quick. Base turrets can waste unprepared ships very quickly too. But the enemies are mostly fairly easy to defeat once you work out the techniques. The AI is fairly basic and isn't very pro-active. The gunplay and survival elements are a little rudimentary overall, although it's still playable.

The resource gathering, mining, construction elements are great fun. There's a variety of ways to gather, with a good range of resources. The development team have published a lot of the configuration files for use, so there are currently a number of people tuning the game to their own tastes, and in some case publishing those changes for others. It's great to see how much the configuration options for the game have been opened up, even if there is little to no documentation.

Multiplayer is by far the most fun. Working together with others and seeing their weird and wonderful creations is epic. Building a base for the entire faction and then seeing everyone's ships parked around is very rewarding. PvP is also fun even if it is very janky and quite buggy. There is quite a lot of toxicity from a small section of the PvP community in the game, but PvP is easily avoided by joining a PvE focused server. The devs appear to have lost patience with this section of PvPers and have been neglecting PvP a lot recently, which is understandable but sad. PvP is definitely the most dynamic part of gameplay with the most potential if improved.

The community is moderately friendly (discord, forums), but I've found the dev team is a bit inaccessible. They tend to not comment on exploit reports or suggestions, they refuse to discuss directions, and they don't currently have any roadmap. Polite requests for help with bugs that are a big pain for many people are often ignored or treated like a joke. Suggestions and feedback get no love, acknowledgement or even interaction most of the time, which is a mistake for a game where the community creation and feedback is supposedly so central. They're also terrible at community management at times, apparently struggling with knowing how to deal with toxic players. I would also say that development work is continuing, but at a snail's pace.

The decision making process for changes and feature decisions is bizarre at times. Sometimes they seem to have made kneejerk decisions for a playerbase popularity stunt, at other times changes don't seem to have had any community input. I think they could benefit from spending more time talking to experienced players, content creators and server managers.

Still, there's a lot to do and if you like sci-fi and constructing things, this is for you.

All in all, this is an amazing purchase for it's price. If you've played Space Engineers, it's that, except with much better block selection, worse physics, similar though distinct graphics, and better PvE / survival elements. If you've never played a game like this before, think Minecraft in space for grown-ups.

ORIGINAL REVIEW
At the moment I can't be bothered to list all of the gameplay problems here, there are too many.
What I will say is that it's good looking scenery (the praise going to the game Engine) masks an incomplete gaming experience that will leave you biting your tongue in half with frustration.
It has a selling point of building vast structures which is hilarious as the building mechanics are poor and confusing . It puts you off building.
Half baked story line and npc interactions, and ohh my god the same constant repeating animal sound samples which are mixed too loud.
I was shocked when I heard how long this has been in development and it being on sale makes me feel this project will soon stop, leaving users with an incomplete product.
You only have to play Space Engineers or No Mans Sky to see how far this game has to go to be called Alpha.
I will of course change this review if things change.",1592500080,1655800737,False,11,2,0.527362644672393799,0,True,False,True

It blends the designs of No Man's Sky, Elite Dangerous, and Space Engineers (which are all good games themselves) for a unique feel that neither of those three pull off all on their own. With modular construction elements, you can freely design your own bases (earth-bound or space-based), and your own vehicles (from hover bikes to interstellar behemoths). Or, if you aren't feeling especially creative, you can use the blueprint-prefab system (which supports community creations) to create buildings or vehicles by simply adding their requisite resources. This game is free-roam and open-ended, unless if you wish to pursue the default scenarios the game comes with, or you can use community-made scenarios (to add story to your adventures). From skirmishes on land, to vast armada warfare in CO-OP/PVP, this game ultimately has a bit of everything that lovers of space-sims (or more arcade-like space games like NMS) will enjoy.

There's great things, you can build custom vehicles and play with them in a world populated with NPCs. There is fun to be had. Don't expect a tight experience though. 

Grids can be textured mostly on a per surface (as opposed to a per block) basis, which is a nice feature. 

Some things I take personal issue with:
Any item in the world despawns after a few minutes if not put in some inventory. Even in a singleplayer game.

No custom ground vehicles. 

Tutorial is very bad, it consists of screens that block character control without pausing game time even in singleplayer. Too much text and not enough information.

The planets feel fake, rather than model a spherical world the planetary map is a flat rectangle and it gets visually bent as you fly up. While this does simplify a lot of things for the devs it makes certain regions of every planet unusable.

Game has small grids for vehicles and large grids that make up large ships and bases. The type of grid is arbitrary and you can't build a grid without a special starter block. This makes construction unintuitive. A

Vehicles don't recieve any collision damage so racing on the planets is not thrilling, just annoying. Plus ramming is therefore not viable, making all piloting feel empty and artificial.

Quest system feels like it belongs into an early alpha. The quest logs are empty and useless, yet the screen with quest logs is cluttered with useless and repeated information from tutorials that can't be hidden or deleted. The whole PDA is just bad. NPC dialog screens often feature images and videos that don't fit the frame and obscure response buttons. And that's when the quests themselves even work. It's not uncommon to just not recieve the quest drop because the quest items aren't normally obtainable trough gameplay means, some subroutine has to notice that it should spawn them in your inventory when the stars align or something. It's not very good at it or the quests are poorly explained. Hopefully this relatively new feature will get fixed soon.

As far as building goes it feels limited. Still the game places on you too few restrictions, all item containers can magically exchange material between them, but only in specific scenarios and not more than two containers at a time. Thrusters don't have to even point outside of the ship. 

Player progression is in the game. Also even basic crafting utilities have to be unlocked. It combines a level requirement and tech point spending. 


The whole game feels like someone figured they could add yet another feature without thinking how they're going to interact with each other.

I really like that the devs are actively working to make the game better based off player feedback.
Always so many major content updates. I am actually surprised how quick they are to fix bugs. Ya the game still has some but really back when I started playing it was barely noticeable.

You are not paying $60, but it feels way worth it in replayablity. 
I have No Mans Sky and that game finally looks better 2years later after release but still sucks and is a very boring grind. 
This game looks great and gives you so much freedom to do what you want. So much depth. Explore build create fight on land and inspace. Solo play, Co-Op or on a server.

Play till you think you did everything? Then come back a month later and bam new content! No DLCs just the real deal.
And you don't need a beast computer to play it.

[b]Update:[/b]  Tried game again, but newest update messed the game up worse than before.  Tutorial still trash/broken, more bugs than before, bugs from initial launch on Steam still exist, English text/story still pretty poor - honestly just too many issues for a game that has been in Early Access for this many years...
===

Can you have fun - yes.  Could you have more fun playing something else - definitely.  Should you buy this - maybe.

I've owned this game since it appeared on Steam.  At one point I posted a positive review while it was in Early Access, but then other better games came along and this one failed to fix a lot of the bugs and issues that existed - I changed my review to negative and uninstalled the game.

Some time passed, they made some updates.  I tried the game again and did not like some of the changes made, but as I didn't really play long I deleted my review while still uninstalling the game - thinking, I'll let it 'bake' a bit longer and come back to it.

Well, here we are and I find that the game still has some of the bugs from Early Access.  The tutorial, mission structure, and various other plot devices are still a hot mess and even mods can't seem to fix some of this.  To be clear - this is NOT Space Engineers and it isn't meant to be, but that isn't the problem.

I don't know if the devs simply have no desire to fix longstanding bugs or that they don't know how to.  I DO know that they should be able to fix things like the fact that there are dialog boxes that pop up when you are doing something else only to disappear before you can read them - especially when some other dialog boxes pop up, pause the action, and require you to click to progress.  They could also fix broken story elements, the quirkiness with building, balance issues, and a host of other things - but to date, they haven't.

As I said, the game can be fun.  It can also be frustrating.  Mods can only do so much due to the 'baked' in bugs and limitations.  If after all of these years I thought they'd fix the bugs and iron out the other issues, I'd be recommending this game to everyone.  As it is, my suggestion is you wait yet a few more years and see what develops.

What I would like to see is more automation and balance in the systems.  Why do I have to manually process/craft fuel and move it to the generator, why does the generator and fuel storage emit radiation even when using biofuel, why isn't there more automation overall - I mean, are you telling me we got to interstellar travel by hand-feeding fuel into generators...",1618491956,1655689465,False,157,10,0.823520183563232422,0,True,False,False

Now, the building part is OK-ish, janky but within low-budget open world survival craft limits. The UI is confusing, the millionth iteration of a tutorial is marginally better than before but still a mess. And the combat... Oh my. I really, REALLY don't mean this as a hyperbole, but the combat feels and looks like something from mid-90s. Daggerfall, Might and Magic 6, heck, probably even the first Doom are superior. I'm not exaggerating, it's just a bunch of stock assets bumbling about.

I want to like this game, I really do. But it's not what I hoped it would be and at this point I'm sure it never will. If you're looking for this one sandbox space sim where you can freely travel both on planet surface and in space, build your ships and bases, explore stuff and whatnot, this is NOT the right game. Stay away from this mess.

Old review:

It's a good tech demo, still very much an early access alpha. If you manage to get it at a serious discount, at least -75%, then maybe it's worth it. I would've refunded but I went above the 2hr limit before realising how unfinished this is. I'll give it some more time since I won't be getting my money back, maybe it'll grow on me somehow. At the time of writing this review I really regret buying this.

Update: I gave it a chance, played it some more and it's the usual story of the open world crafting survival genre. It's one of these games that you really want to like because of the concept but almost everything you do is either wonky, unclear, unfinished or just badly designed. It has something going for it though. The idea of building your own bases and ships block by block and being able to fly around both on planets and in space in your own creations is awesome but the building process is just so clunky it sucks out all the fun.

I don't know how to explain it but the game feels like somebody's personal project rather than a product to be sold. My guess is that it's just another ambitious EA game whose scope outgrew the developers' resources/capabilities and they jumped straight from version 0.2 to 1.0 and called it done.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND

This had the potential to become an awesome game...  ""Empyrion - Galactic Survival"" is survival, shooter, building, exploring. It could maybe be called the ""arcade-version"" of Space Engineers - Except SE is a MUCH better game. EGS is not finished at all, and i doubt it will ever improve. On the oposite, it keeps getting worse and worse.

The tutorial have now (1.8) gone from ""bad"" to ""horrible"", even laugable. There is a text to voice trying to guide you, and even pops up stupid videos from youtube or something. The tutorial interupts your gameplay constantly with annoying pop-ups. The tutorial is one big wall of text and do not seem to have much logic.

The 3rd person view is completely ruined too, absolutely uncontrolable compared to earlier where it actually worked. Same with motorbike, and lot of other stuff, that actually worked in earlier builds. Now its just not working anymore. 

Unfinished UI, horrible language (its a german team), xp balancing, options in general. It actually almost worked in the ealier builds. Then we have bugs bugs bugs and more bugs. 

Build in Unity, some models are very outdated, game is not optimized and lot of players have problems with overheating. A decent system is required to play this, and it will still be lagging.

The developer team is small, this is an indie game for sure ... The potential was there to become a great game, that people would remember for a long time ... But in my opinion it has failed big time with 1.8. 

I will not recommend the story missions or any of the (USERMADE!) POI stuff.

you can no longer steer your escape pod and choose a landing site, witch also worked fine in earlier builds. 

Crafting, building and exploring is a big part of the game. And thats the only fun there is.
You must gather/grind ingredients to make food, fuel and oxygen (for your advancement into space). You can make a ""vessel"" to aid you ... The motorbike is easy to make, but it really dont drive well in mountains. So your next option is a ""hover vessel"" that can get you around quickly and help carry all your stuff. You will need to build a base too. 

Picking up resources, exploring,  and killing enemies gives you XP. When you level up you can unlock your ""tech-tree"" and gain acces to new technologies and better weapons. Be ware there are lots of creepy bugs and aliens in the game, also lot of spiders.

When you have build your base it will be attacked by enemy drones. Fortunately you can set up defences on your base, but it can still be a real challenge when you first encounter the enemy, and you might have to rebuild your base. Repairing a base made of reinforced concrete is a PITA really, it will take you ages and a lot of yawning...

If you want revenge you can try to engage the enemy. Take over their bases and loot all their stuff. POI's (Places of Interest) is a big part of the game (these are partly user-made). You will find enemy bases, abandoned mines, Burial grounds filled with spiders and giant scorpions, crashed spacecraft, some factions have big stations (almost cities) that you can visit and trade with (if youre not hostile to them of course) ...

If you get bored by all this, build a ""small vessel"" or even a ""capital vessel"" to venture into space. There is a whole galaxy to explore, and you can go very long distance with the ""warp drive"" ... Later in the end-game, set up teleporters to the other parts of the galaxy.

And if you get bored of building, use the ""factory"" to spawn in your vessels and bases (or try out other builders stuff via the workshop) ...

This game needs so much work, but it will never happen. The dev team are not listening to their costumers at all, and they keep building more stuff on top of the bad stuff, witch is always bound to fail sooner or later.",1545080899,1655633235,False,0,0,0.510159671306610107,0,True,False,False

AI is broken. sometimes it just stands and lets you kill what ever was attacking you. Sometimes it actually attacks and then runs away. Its actually fun you think AI is smart and retreats. Sadly no. If you follow it you can just kill it again because it just ignores you. When you figure how it works you can use the same tricks to kill all of them.

Building is interesting but til the point you see there's nothing after. Building something massive feels empty. There is nothing to fill the space.

Space ships are fun. But again. Till the point its not. There is nothing after you can do.

Anyway, when Empyrion works it really is pretty vast and very diverse in its activities, challenges and experiences and overall extremely enjoyable. Yet when it doesn't work it can be one of the most frustrating sobs I've ever played!!! I really do like this game, to which my aggregate hours played attest, but the more you play the more often you will suffer this kind of frustration. The Devs seem reasonably active, but not necessarily especially on stuff that still needs sorting out, despite some of it having been around for quite a while now. Anyway, I've done my best to warn you about Mr Hyde, but I still have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Dr Jekyll.
=====================================================================================
I've played a lot of hours of this until now. Now, I have two small vessels parked in a capital vessel, all my own. Both small vessels are registered as docked inside the capital vessel. However, the capital vessel refuses to move, because it says I have a non-docked craft on board. Well, I have only two craft, the small vessels, both of which were transported to this system inside the capital vessel. Now all three vessels are trapped inside this system and completely unable to explore the rest of the universe at large. The game is therefore terminated. I am not going to go back and start again. 

I refuse to mess about anymore with this issue, which, no-one else appears to have experienced. My time playing this game which as can be seen from number of hours played I was really quite enjoying. Shame, but to have come all this way only to be stopped dead in my tracks like this makes the other 636 hours a complete waste of time. 

I am therefore warning you not to risk wasting your time and hard-earned money on this, but rather to invest in the likes of ""No Man's Sky"" or ""Satisfactory"" instead, with whom I have encountered nothing as remotely ludicrous as this game-ending experience.",1534698638,1655531748,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

====== old review [2019] for the never ending alpha ======
Eleon, FUCK YOUR ALPHA EXCUSE.
After playing this for 3 years since A5, the game is still in the same sorry state full of stupid bugs, Stupid Bugs and STOOPID Bugs.

I'm sorry I wasted so many thousands of hours playing this crap.  This is time I will never get back.

I'm sorry I kept hoping that one day -- before I die of old age-- Eleon will deliver on their much promised product.
A product where whatever you carefully acquired after days or weeks of playing will not just go to the shithole in one fell swoop. Why? because why not.

I'm sorry I ever tried to help, pointing at issues, pointing again at issues, pointing YET AGAIN at the SAME fucking issues, because they could be so easy to fix -- but why bother fixing.

Also, I'm sorry I paid for this.

This game is a big fucking waste of everyone's time.  Including the devs' time, who should instead take a boat and go fishing. Who knows, they might actually catch a competent programmer shrimp.

EDIT  April 2020

been away for a few months and what do i come back to?  Not only do i need just a few iron ores to make the PC, the O2 gen, AND the heater (yep, just iron. no copper, no silicon. nothing).
But now it takes ONE SINGLE GOD DAMN IRON INGOT for the entire Bike????
On ""survival"" ?
With ""hard"" settings ?
And the detector takes exacly zero anything to make....
What. the. Fuck.

This game has become a glorious masturbatorium for all the 11yo cheap lame idiots who can't put together 1+2, let alone look for 3 different ores before they asphyxiate in a breathable atmo.

Good news is that the game is really good. Worth a play. Certainly has that Beta feel, especially when on a dedicated server, but still is fun.

The idea of resource collection, base building, and fighting has been done by many, but the game has a bit of fun as it expands out from survival planet side, to space fighters, to capital ships.

There are downsides, like not being able to place simple blocks off the connected base. Concrete blocks even have to be connected to a base and within X distance only. That makes for a bummer, but I suppose.

Starter planets lack basic resources, specifically fuel which is needed for EVERYTHING, including powering a ship to go to another planet.  Game still very buggy, only way to get around without fuel is a cheap electric bike.  Ultimately no point since its impossible to ever leave the starter planet without fuel.  Still the bike has the turning radius of a bus, it seems like its magnetized to run into trees, even gets stuck on butterflies, wtf?  Any damage causes injuries which are impossible to fix in most cases, including a simple cut which apparently can NOT be fixed with bandages, so you eventually just die for blood loss from even simple injuries.  1/2 the time you ride your bike your character appears to be standing on top of the seat running rather than sitting.

The online community is virtually dead.  Last time I played this a couple years ago you could find at least a few servers hosting over 100- 200 online players.

It's not a grind issue -that seems to be well balanced, it's that on hardest settings, with NO ORES starting out it's simply a time waster to have to go get them.  Good game design means that CHANGES TO SETTINGS should affect more in the game than TIME SPENT (wasted).  That's why it's ridiculous to reduce the number of ore deposits and their size from max settings, as it just makes you travel further and waste time getting there, because TIME is all it affects, nothing else.  Replay-ability is crushed by this boredom built in.  There's no challenge involved other than scanning for them, and that doesn't take long since on hardest you also get a motorbike.  REALLY?? - the hardest game setting spoon feeds you a motorbike?  Even on the EASIEST setting on a game like 7 Days to Die, you just have a pair of pants on.

Back many versions ago, there would often be a drone guarding one or more of the ores you needed.  Now that's what HARDEST should be about, risking your life and all you've gathered to somehow race under the drone and drill down to safety before it kills you, gather the last ore and get the heck out of there.  Hardest should be regular drone patrols of 1-3 drones you have to dodge to get anywhere safely until you can take them on.

As an avid space game genre fan I've played countless hours of primarily Elite Dangerous and more recently Star Citizen.  For $20 Empyrion is absolutely worth recommending, and that is a seriously low price for what you are getting here.  There is no pay to win or paid mods.  The depth of Empyrion is awesome and it does so many things right!  I'm constantly rewarded for playing and that feeling is consistent no matter the activity.  The Reforged Eden mod is a must!  Some of the POI's in Reforged Eden are so much fun.  Levels are huge, and when you complete the raid/activity you are rewarded with seriously awesome loot!  The visuals in 1.7 are very satisfying and level design is well thought out to include NPC dialogue and choose your own adventure esq dialogue where your choices and decisions matter, especially with the other NPC factions!  I haven't even scratched the surface at 60 hours, but I will most likely dump a few hundred more hours into Empyrion before I get even begin to feel full.  The open platform design clearly shows a passion from the developer to the community, where modding takes this game to the next level.  The only negative is the MMO capability, as you need to host or join a private server.  Dedicated public servers are missing and would be nice to have, however it is not necessarily a bad thing after hosting a server with myself and some friends.

This game is great if you have the time for it, or even if you dont. If your gaming time is limited, Id avoid the multiplayer servers unless you have friends that can bring you out of the starting areas as they reset often, resulting in all your hard work being deleted. I have very little vanilla experience, because once i discovered the scenarios, i quickly dumped it and went to them. 
Single player is great for those without time because you leave it for long periods of time and not have to worry about logging in to fuel your base, ship, miners, etc. Also you can bypass things like waiting on plants to grow back or in your farm by using a bed/tent to fast forward time. 
Scenarios tend provide a lot of content that vanilla was missing. Especially if you can find a server where they have people that tweak the scenarios to add content or items. These servers often tend to have great player communities.
But if your like me and just really enjoy building cool things, the workshop is loaded with everything from city sized capital vessels to flying chairs for you to subscribe and use or modify. I recommend downloading random things and disassembling them to figure out how people did things, its the fasted way to learn how to build.

The game is riddled with bugs that make the main quest line borderline unplayable. One quest that ""triggers automatically"" never triggered at all. Game balance is fairly poor, combat is janky, and elevators are absolutely terrible. I selected the largest size available for starting planet, and the planet still feels tiny by any measure. The whole scale of distances in the game is completely nonsensical. Dialogue reads like it was written by a non-English speaker. In-game economics are absurd, as vendors never seem to replenish inventories but have unlimited funds, and you can buy anything you want by crafting and selling enough cheap sniper rifles. While the game mechanics are complex and clearly took a great deal of effort to create, none of the complexity actually lends itself to compelling gameplay.

This game tries really hard to scratch the ""Minecraft in space"" itch, and it might have had a chance, if it was developed by a large game studio.

Audio is really bad, many sounds of for example your bike, walking, thrusters make you insane as they are obviously looped. You cannot tell where sounds are coming from, so in building you hear 1000 times footsteps like they are next to you.

Map design is OK, but they wrapped a square map around a planet so the poles are not usable and if you fly over the point where the map meets itself you are ""teleported"" to the beginning and all models need to be loaded again. Lazy programming. Also going to, or coming from orbit is a fake loading screen.

AI is laughably stupid, NPCs are straight from the 90s videogames, the animations are sooo bad. Also the sounds of the AI is very annoying, They all have the same death animation and sound so if you are killing a group of one type it sounds so stupid.

 I bought this game in Early Access and just noticed it is not in EA any more since some time, I do not understand how they can call this a released game.

Don't get me wrong if you are into Creative Building it is nice , but that's IT. All the rest is kindergarten n00b mode game development. I once tried to create a tutorial for Unreal Engine, like import a character , create animation and make it shoot. That is exactly how this game feels. Some guy created one animation for all NPCs and called it a day. They walk like they have blisters under their armpits. It is really hilarious so cringy is it.

I have played alot of No Man's Sky and enjoyed it quite a bit for awhile- with one very big caveat.................the cartoonish graphics and garish colors of the planets and space became off-putting after awhile. I was looking for a more realistic ""feel"" to the experience. I briefly tried Elite Dangerous but found it a complete bore, though the graphics were fine. And now I I have {thankfully} found Empyrion. Graphically It is far better than NMS and nearly on a par with ED. But the gameplay runs rings around ED.

I love the wide-open feel of the game. No scripts to follow - you can just do your own thing.  The modding community is amazing with a huge number of custom-designed bases, ships, etc. There is a bit of a learning curve and I feel I've just scratched the surface in learning the mechanics of the game.

An absolute free-roaming experience awaits you: warp between planets, fly from planet to moons, land on planets and freely walk around to explore your surroundings. Discover the secrets of different alien races and tangle with the native fauna and flora. A sandbox full of different, vivid planets is waiting for you to explore!

This is one terrific game being improved upon all the time, Kudos to the developers!

1) An inde game put together by a small team running it all by the seat of their pants.  It is not polished perfect... but it has a lot of heart and soul.

2) A survival game starting with bare hands and requiring you to manage health, hunger stamina and oxygen levels as well as combat various forms of disease and mutilation you may suffer when you fight

3) A building game where you engineer and build custom vehicles and bases with a block based system after refining materials.  With the raw materials, you can also spawn blueprints that have already been created by you or others from the workshop.  It can be fun just to go creative and spawn ships you have collected into library to explore them and try them out.

4) A harvesting game where you dig into voxel based planets and asteroids for resources. 

5) A procedural game where no two saves create the same universe.

6) An exploration game with lots of points of interest to discover both on the starting planet and in the universe that waits you when you achieve space flight.  Lots of different types of suns and planets with different characteristics.  Several factions of NPC to interact with.  Points of interest spawn randomly all over the universe.

7) A salvaging game where you can rip apart your enemies ships and bases and make them into your own creations... or sell the parts...or scrap them.  You will also find derelict ships and buildings.

8) A trading game where you can find various resources or devices and sell them to traders for profit.  Or, you can buy things from traders and sell them to other traders for profit.  Or you can make things out of your resources and sell them for profit.

9) A first person shooter game where you fight insects, zombies, aliens and military forces in contexts ranging from horror dungeon crawler to military conquest of bases.

10 ) A space ship combat game where you attack bases with your small ship to soften them up... or you go capital ship to capital ship in a massive showdown of missiles and energy weapons.

11) A good single player experience and also a decent looking multi player experience on a server setup.

12) Backed up by an incredibly good mod scenario known as ""Reforged Eden"" which takes the game to an even higher level of challenges and enjoyment.

13) Still being actively updated as of June 2022.

I have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of this game.    The only major thing I wish it had was the ability to walk around on your ship as it is flying (you can only fly while in the pilot seat) and the ability to command a fleet of ships that can do various tasks such as surveying a system, defending the mothership, or mining.  Those would make the game pretty much everything I could ask for.


The negative reviews I see are not entirely inaccurate... but this game has so much heart... and it has done so much with so little...that I feel like those complaints are not a deal breaker for me.  Some of the complaints require hundreds of hours playing before they become apparent.  Most will find a lot of enjoyment before that happens.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the features I have described above.  I have not come across many games that check so many boxes.",1654718777,1654718777,True,77,4,0.824268758296966553,3,True,False,False

- fun combat whether fps on foot or in a vehicle
- good variety of weapons for character or vehicle

First person view point, massive open world game. You crash land on a starter planet, from there you learn to survive, craft a base and survive more comfortably. Then once you make a Small Vessel, you can explore your solar system, and eventually get to build a Capital Vessel and go wherever you want! Once you have a Capital Vessel which can be equipped with a Warp Drive you can leave your solar system and explore literally the entire galaxy, this game is massive!

Solo this game can be fun, but if you know even one or two people that might want to play then do it! Exploring the galaxy with your friends and looting random places you find is so much fun. Building takes a little getting used to with rotating build pieces but once you figure it out this game is countless hours of entertainment. There is nothing more rewarding than building a ship block by block and eventually fueling it up and utilizing it to explore the galaxy.

I have put a lot of hours into playing, spread out over many years. I have even been interested enough to polish some of my in game designs for posting on the Steam Workshop. My stupid conscience won't let me give it a thumbs-up though, because this game is clearly another example of a great idea that isn't getting the time and resources it needs to realize its potential. There are a multitude of these half-realized dreams on Steam, and it really makes me question the Early Access concept in general. Players like me pay to fund development of these games, instead of paying for a finished game, with no guarantee that the development will ever actually happen. Maybe we paid for some dev to live and work for awhile and then just move on to another project. Let's call that what it is: A donation to an artist, not the purchase of a product!

Empyrion does some things well. It really is a galactic survival game, where you can begin as a castaway astronaut with nothing but some hand tools, lost on an alien world. You can explore neat-looking landscapes, harvest materials, fight AI people and monsters, and build bases and working vehicles from scratch. You can construct a spacecraft, and fly seamlessly from planet surface to orbital space, and then from there fly freely to any nearby asteroids or moons. When you develop sufficient technology, you can build ships capable of traveling faster than light and visit other planets and, beyond that, a whole galaxy of star systems with their own planets. You can build everything from tiny ships to huge ones, and stage battles between spaceships. 

It does all of this well enough for me to keep coming back once a year to see how development is coming along, despite my continual disappointment with the state of the game. Basic game mechanics that you use for harvesting and constructing feel clunky and unfinished. Some basic things, like the system for creating artificial gravity on ships and space stations, have been left unfinished for years, with no indication from the devs whether they will ever be improved on. Recent updates seem to be focused on minor visual tweaks (just now adding schools of fish to bodies water?), which really should have been done years ago. The ""experience"" and player progression system is slapped-together and serves no purpose. You could remove it completely and not change the gameplay at all. The end-game is almost non-existent here. Once you get the ability to build whatever you want, you realize how few block choices there really are in the game. Big bases and ships end up feeling empty, there aren't a lot of devices with actual functionality, so spaces end up filled with useless decorations just to make the space look like it serves a purpose. AI currently is 2-dimensional, interaction with AI players is minimal in the extreme, and all AI creatures behave more or less the same in combat, meaning you can use the same tactics in every danger situation and win easily. Changes voted up by regular players on the game forums are just ignored by the devs when they don't feel like addressing them.

Instead of adding art to the game, the devs should be polishing and filling out the game mechanics, making the basic game feel more varied, and giving it a meaningful sense of progression. In this kind of game, players can make their own art, but they can't fix a broken foundation.

The planet you start on has nearly no resources, the higher tier resources are next to none, and the POE/dungeon/mission setups are absolutely TERRIBLE. Weapons feel absolutely awful. The standard rifle fires incredibly slow for an automatic, shotgun damage is low enough that if an enemy got close enough for it to be viable you are already going to take a lot of damage because it will not kill easily, the upgraded rifles have more DPS but otherwise apart from a higher fire rate and an addition of a rather weak scope feel the exact same.

     every character looks straight from the Unity store, same with the weapons and hostile small fighters, and the creatures look so inconsistent with their environment. Even animations seem insanely basic, again possibly purchased from somewhere like the unity asset store. It is clear the only real thing being worked on here is an idea.

     I have been unable to get to a different system as every time I got close to doing so I would get screwed over by some enemies spawning nearby a place I park at a (friendly or even neutral) when they were not there moments ago even if I do a scan right before parking, even if I do get somewhere else on the rare chance I get even near enough resources for a warp drive I am obliterated by a patrolling hostile ship shortly after arriving.

     This game DESPRATELY needs to add much more resources to the starting. At least just throw more resources in space as a lot more asteroids.

     People say this game is an ""Upgrade"" from Space Engineers, those people are retarded and need to stop stroking their own cocks at the idea. Space Engineers accepts a MUCH wider modding community than this POS which only allows ship models to build and spawn in. Plus Space engineers transition from space to planet is incredibly smooth where in Empyrion you are forced into a slight game freeze as it has to load the new area. Even ship capabilities in Space Engineers is so much broader than this with the abilities of even creating your own complex weapon systems than your hard pre-set weapon turrets on empyrion. And thats not getting into the models, weapons, and hostile buildings and ships between the games, which I can say with CERTAINTY that Space Engineers comes out on top.

is only 7 years in development

1.8.2021 The developers sell the game in German and yet the tutorial is once again only in English... Professionals just like always... they just never change

The turning circle of the motorbike is still tied to the FPS.
With 25 FPS you have a ""small"" turning circle. 
If I set the maximum FPS to 200, the motorbike has a turning circle of an articulated lorry with 2 trailers.

The bug has been known for years.

They said the motorbike is only a temporary solution. Something else is coming... still after years nothing has changed...

I don't get it... you call yourselves programmers? Shame on you. Shame on you!
The 1x1 of programming... Don't tie the game mechanics/physics to the FPS....

10/22/2019 Played on a bit.... Yet another hole in the world that won't be fixed by the restart this time.... Pros...

Update 21.10.2019 Played briefly. found huge hole in the world and already not up for it. 
4 years of development ? Professionals at work !
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1895570753

Update 29.4. still extreme grind. Even if you set rich ores, there are only medium mines. Silicon even only one mine and that in friend area....

Look at Ark, so many options to set you give the players !!!!

Lots of texture bugs

No sensors in space... It can happen that enemy stations shoot at you before you even realise that it is an enemy station...

Also the search for resources in space is a matter of luck and can take a long time if you are looking for something specific (really, really long) ... This way you increase the game time for no reason. It's a lousy way to give games more playing time.

It still happens that you can't mine trees and stones and have to restart the game. Old bug. Never fixed ...


Original : The game itself is quite interesting. A mixture of Starforge and Space Engineers with a portion of Starmade.

The ideas are well implemented so far. But it is not more than a demo so far. I am very curious when more real non-design content beyond the Unityengine (and Voxelfarm ?) possibilities will come.

The planets are causing technical problems. That's why the poles are still locked. The feeling of freedom is not yet there. But that should be fixed in 2-4 weeks.

There is still a lot to do. More and different vehicle armour. There are already different types of weapons that are getting stronger.
You still have to grind quite a lot. Automatic ore mining is missing because the further you get the more ore you need which is just a grind.

The development team seems to be motivated. The support and the mods too.

Actually, this sounds like a positive review so far. Unfortunately it is not.

What is offered so far is STILL very rudimentary. The Unityengine (and Voxelfarm ?) already offers a lot of things by itself, unfortunately only a few users know that. Up to now a lot is design and allocation of functions that Unity or Voxelfarm offers. 

A good example is the ground vehicle. Even nowadays in reality you can drive up mountains with a hovercraft without getting stuck with the ""nose"". The Unity engine doesn't offer that by itself, so the game can't do it either. What will come one day... who knows. As players, we know that words are ephemeral. Only what is ingame and works is really ingame. 

The review is negative because I can no longer play since patch 2.1.0. When I get into a small spaceship, for example, I have to move the mouse a good 20 times for a 360 degree turn. This is not an RCS problem. It only affects the mouse. The sideways movements with A and D are very fast/normal. 
Changing from left to right with the mouse also causes problems. I have a delay of about 2 seconds.  Flying in space or fighting like that is impossible.

At first I thought I was alone with the problem but slowly several users are reporting the problem and it only affects this game and only when using the vehicles and only since patch 2.1.0.

The support was very helpful but in the end the advice was rather ... hmm... I say questionable because it was clear from the beginning that they wouldn't help (delete the game from the registry and provide a save although it affects all saves and the game mechanics and you can't find anything that way).

I'm waiting for the fact that I can play again at all and then I want to see real programming work, then the thumbs go up very gladly. As the saying goes. Potential is there...

Here is the video where you can see the delay:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsm1htJjXZI

Edit : Patch 3.2.1 no changes. The delay when changing direction with the mouse is simply infinite. It's impossible to fight properly.

I really tried everything to find the bug on my side. But it remains the only game where I have these problems and I play quite a few.

I have never changed the mouse sensitivity or DPS in a game. I have always adapted. Here that is not possible.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCIGZnRuCe0

Support doesn't agree either. One says it's clearly a bug. The other says I'm just too stupid to fly.

Well, after my experience with the support and their, shall I say, snootiness, both the game and the support can ...

Starforge 2.0

Edit : It's funny the support for this game. 

The australian mod tells in the bugreportforum only .... and doesn't recognize the turning bug or blames it on bad drivers ( yes of course different Logitech hard- and software tested and only in this game you have problems but it's the drivers... ) but it's only a few that have problems... ) but there are only a few who report the bug so the people are just too stupid to fly.... and the support said to me yes even it is a bug.

Well really coordinated the guys and so united....

Edit : Patch 4.2.1 

It got a lot better but when you make fast long movements with the mouse the game still reacts completely wrong and the ship turns slower instead of faster.
Small and slow movements it does quite well now.

Edit : Patch 5.0.2

A miracle has happened. Finally the controls are ok again like they were at the very beginning. 4 months for the fix... For me it was unplayable in the meantime.

Important points for me Poles are still locked because the engine can't display a ball. Let's see when they will fix it. According to mod and dev it should only take 4 weeks after EA release... 

Hover still floats horizontally instead of following the angle of the mountain. Hovercrafts can do that nowadays. But not a futuristic hover vehicle in this game. The engine can't do it, so the ingame hover can't do it either.... 

These two things have to be changed at least before the review becomes positive. Because these are two things that require real programming work and not only to master the functions of an engine but also to be able to break or change its specifications. The difference between modder and programmer and the programmers haven't proven that yet.

Edit : 2 years later, after the borders were supposedly removed and planets can be flown completely openly, nothing has happened here.

""Empyrion - Galactic Survival is a space survival adventure in an open 3D world where you can fly through space and over continents on planets""

Na na. There the shop description also says more than the game itself can.

This game is not finished. I am about to start my third playthrough due to gamebreaking bugs. Worlds warping around my base to sink it hundreds of feet into the earth and finally getting to explore the  galaxy in a ship I've just built, only to find new planets are generating with zero resources or NPC faction bases. 

Honestly this game is really fun, like a simpler space engineers with more focus on shooting things, enemy factions actively try to raid and takeover your bases, and you can do the same to theirs, capital ships are like flying bases and dogfighting in fighters is clunky but fun.

If they hadn't chosen to announce the game as 1.0 I'd be caling this an immensely successful and fun game that is full of bugs I expect to see getting fixed in future, but since announcing they are 1.0 that either means they've announced the game will not be getting more updates, in which case don't buy it, or they're lying to generate sales, which is just crappy.

From small hovercraft, through beautiful and deadly capital vessels to whole new game configurations and scenarios which provide replay-ability you wouldn’t expect.

I spent 1000+ hours alone in single player (so won’t cover multiplayer and great community there) and if you like Minecraft, Space Engineers, No Man’s Sky, Elite or X series you’ll definitely find something interesting.

There are few bugs here and there and game may look a rough in places but it’s definitely a gem.

Starting with nothing, slowly building up your resources and vehicles while progressing in missions and learning about the galaxy and your missing friends is great but when you finally get a capital vessel (where you can get your hovercraft and small ship in) it’s just amazing. 
And after a while you can just start modifying it.

Extra turret? Why not. Additional storage? No problem. Not enough thrust on hi-gravity planets – just upgrade existing or add more thrusters – solved.

This is probably the main aspect that hoked me up – you don’t like something in your ship – change it. You feel adventurous – build one from scratch in creative mode, save and produce it in the survival mode.

It's a constant battle against the controls, that have a clunkiness i haven't experienced since the first 3d games on the Playstation One.  I can't even do simple things like picking up a tent and successfully jumping to places is a coin toss at best.

I'm confronted with a fearsome foe in the save system that seems to delight in removing previous saves when i quit the game because it forces a new save that removes the old ones.  Good luck to you if you are left with only saves where you are placed in a disadvantageous situation.

But the worst offender has got to be my constant battle to avoid puking all over my screen because the camera, first person or otherwise, is so jittery.

TUTORIAL
 - Completed tutorial in 36 hours of ""game launched"" time. If you are serious about it, you could do it in less than half that time. But when the game text panders to you saying ""you made it farther than any cadet"", they actually mean it. And that's not a good thing. The tutorial is clunky, and keeps showing you instructions when not on the screen to do them. Also has some gaps in explanation. 

PHYSICS
 - Vehicles feel so bad. They just instantly move, and break with no physics realism. By far my biggest complaint. I thought it might be better in space, but the auto brakes are so off from physics.

POTENTIAL
 - There is so much in this game. Massive creative building potential, actual somewhat living feeling world. Combat so far also feels weak, but at least it exists. The galaxy seems to be populated. It's a sandbox where you'll make your own fun, but unlike some sandboxes, it seems to feel like it's in a somewhat living world. A lot of improvements to be had, but a lot of potential I don't see in other games. And that's what will keep me playing for now.

UPDATE
 - I was right on the edge of recommending this, but gave it the benefit of the doubt for exploration. The problem is how incredibly touchy quests are. If you find the correct thing to do ahead of time, you can break many steps later in the quest chain. The game does feature an option to tell it ""i complete this"", but doing that can easily break future triggers. I actually got myself soft locked. This is a LONG game, which makes soft locks even more painful. This sort of problem is very basic. That's not me saying it's easily fixable, but soft locking is not really excusable these days.

The mod community fractured the workshop into 2 competing fiefdoms, vanilla and RE.  I'm not a huge fan of the reasons for that split.  There was no need to break some things in vanilla that were better left alone.

Being currently in development it has a potential to make you feel like Han Solo in his Millenium Falcon with dozens of switches to control different devices, lights, turrents etc where you can go in person to any device and fix it if it's broken. It is not there yet since you can't buy used parts requiring regular repairs and you can't access switches from the command seat but it's very close to that.

What the game already has is a huge world to explore and a lot of ships and bases designs to try. Hundreds of hours of content. Every world has it's own spirit, every faction has unique design style. You can't buy ships but you can order their construction then spawn near you. You can find settlments, abandoned factories, space ports, gardens, farms, old ruins, mystery artifacts. All special to a faction and a world type.

I'm pretty sure the game will eventually have used ships salons, ship rental services, scrap yards with a complex parts compatibility system that will make you go to every merchant you find looking for a certain part to upgrade or repair your favourite ship.

For now I have to pretend. I build ships in advance then spawn one when I come to a new planet, so all my ships have stories like souvenirs from different worlds. Maybe I should build a base in every star system I visit but for me it feels more natural to cheat the relationships with factions for them to allow me using their public teleports instead.

At it's core, there is something truly special here. However, much of the UI/UX design gets in the way of the gameplay. After 20 hours, I finally completed the tutorial and found the overall experience to be tragically unpolished, frustratingly convoluted, and depressingly aimless.

The visuals, sound design, UI and animations feel like they are from the 90's, which shouldn't be acceptable when game-engines like Unreal, Lumberyard, Space Engine Pro, etc. exist with free or very low cost assets at the quality that modern day gamers expect.

The game design itself gets in the way of the experience, often times being frustrating and convoluted. For example, in order to get into a turret on my hovercraft I have to go to the control panel, find the turret from the 100's of other devices, and click ""View"" in the sub panel to enter. Many other systems in the game require similar amounts of menu hopping.

Paragraphs of if/then/else text in the tutorial are thrown in your face as you are attacked by enemies, and there are dozens of confusing sub menus you need to remember for almost every function in your ship or base - all of which lacks the most common information you might be looking for at a glance. This becomes even more frustrating when you need to figure out why something isn't functioning in your base/ship, and the game expects you to figure out all of its logic and incidentals on your own.

I really want to like this game. But it desperately needs design help, and unfortunately these issues are unacceptable nowadays.",1652719052,1652719357,False,24,4,0.597159028053283691,0,True,False,False

The Pros

- Amazing and challenging space AI space combat i have seen in a game
- Workshop support. you can easily upload your own creations and lets say hey creating/building is not your thing... no problem grab a base or ship from the workshop and you can build the ship in survival after collecting all the resources you need. 
- Thousands of hours of content with the mix of the vanilla game and mods like Reforged Eden. i have been playing for 700 plus hours and still learn something new about the game every day. 
- Randomly generated galaxy and planets with 10000 star systems (20000 with mods like Reforged Eden) 
- 1000's of POI's to explore, loot and do trading in (POI's include space stations, land bases, AI capital vessels)
- Building system that is similar to 7 days to die. 
- Fun with friends
- The modding community is very responsive and helpful with any questions you may have. 

Now on to the cons of the game.... 

- Limited to speed of ships... cannot change this... hard coded by DEVs.. DEVs are also not ontop of fixing bugs.  
- limited to size of ship. any big ships that you run into in the game causes major lag and can even crash the server. 
- Our first playthrough the save got corrupted due to a server crash in the middle of a big battle.... we had 200 hours in this save and lost everything. to look past this.... i got a better server that backed up twice a day to address this. 
- When it comes to the wiki or finding any info on the game. its lack luster
- They also have this game listed as full release... it really is not a full release they treat it as an Alpha still 
- sometimes you cannot warp to new system at all after a game update sometimes... to remedy this you basically need reinstall the server. you still have your save its just time consuming to reinstall the server to fix this
- You can also change ""TimeoutBootingPfServer to 2000"" this has fixed the warp issue for most but did not fix it for us

To conclude i am still leaving this review as a negative review. I still love this game and its one of my favorite games i have ever played and still see myself playing it for thousands of hours. if you can tolerate the bugs listed above and dont mind troubleshooting to try and work around some of these bugs i say absolutely this game is for you and would recommended %100. If you are expecting a game that is well polished without issues i would say its not for you.

Better graphics than games like Garry's Mod or 7 Days to Die. Not as good as Ark, though. But that doesn't matter. The community has made lots of cool ships that you can build with the blueprint system. Just drag and drop resources into the factory in your PDA.

This game fluctuated through some eras over the course of the last year and a half, but it's currently resting in a good state. There are 10-20 really really REALLY good servers to choose from that the community hosts, so even though it's not a real MMO with official servers, you'll find yourself able to fit into one of the servers, all of which have different settings, storylines and universes created by the moderators of the servers.

About 8 months ago, I considered the game dead. No good servers, and all of them had their resources stripped by the 2 or 3 players that were online.

Now, they did something. Resource respawn works, and meteorites are more frequent when resources are depleted on a planet, giving an alternative source for minerals. NPCs respawn, such as local alien tribes and edible aliens like what I call a ""cow""... which is more elephant-sized.

More mobs have been added, so there are a few different planet types with unique NPCs that spawn on them.

Raidable Points of Interest were updated, making them more difficult to take out and more interesting to raid, in addition to more variety. Some POIs are easier to raid but yield less loot, perfect for new players to get an edge in the POI raiding business and get some nice loot more easily. 

The new drilling modules for HVs and CVs were a FANTASTIC quality of life change.

Radiation and temperature actually work now, which can be extremely frustrating at times but adds more challenge to the game as well as realism.

I lost hope in the game 8 months ago, but have been watching the news and decided to log in and try it again. Fantastic. I love what they've done, and apparently lots of other players do too because the community has been revitalized. 

Active game devs!

If you like space, and want a REAL survival game (Astroneers doesn't qualify, and OSIRIS barely does) get this game, you won't regret it.

And don't just play in single player, get online! Way more interesting and every server has very helpful communities.

EDIT: Removed Osiris from the beginning of my review because this game blows that one away for space survival.

general exploration and survival is good, there are like 20K+ stars in the game galaxy and they all have 1 or more planets orbiting them (sometimes 8+ planets) and some planets have rings around them and look cool af from the surface, cant remember how many planet types there are (i think like 6 or so) but they have some really cool looking ones, and they vary in size and sometimes have multiple moons orbiting. 
oh yea, you can make teleporters for your base so you can have bases in different systems and get to them quickly without having to go into space with your ship, it's pretty nice (some MP servers extend the teleport range which is v nice but if you're playing singleplayer you can edit it in the game files very easily)

the graphics aren't the best and optimization isn't there yet, but the game still looks decent, and once you get into it you start to like how it looks (would recommend capping your FPS to save your GPU some stress)

the devs seem to care and it gets updates fairly regularly, hopefully they keep it up, there a few things i'd still like to see added/improved but overall it's great value for $20 and goes on sale for $10 

i've probably spent 300 of my hours in creative mode just building ships, unless you're already good at designing things, it takes a while to get good and knowing which blocks to use to create the right shapes and surfaces (browsing the workshop for inspiration and building techniques is good place to start if you're having a tough time) but after some practice you'll get the hang of it, and it feels very rewarding flying around in something you made yourself and not just downloaded off the workshop.

I wish I could afford to make a game like this, but a high quality one, instead of being a wage slave on a chain... Maybe I ask the top 2.5K richest to support me in this effort. They probably would.


Played the game a little as it came out from EA but it's in a horrible condition. Can't add much more than what Undead Rufus did [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/UndeadRufus/recommended/383120/] [b]in his review[/b] [/url]. I totally agree with the fellow gamer.

This game was a wonderful promise but it was not and will not ever be finished. Most likely dev/art/etc, so the studio capacity is lower than 'IRL time tick rate', so the studio just can't keep up, it's going down and staying down...



A few things the above linked review doesn't mention (or I just want to empasize) and I found ""interesting"" in the ~5 hours I play-tested the game, as it was coming out of EA:

- There are holes in the terrain here and there, i.e. one falls out the render engine, and when teleported back to the play area gets damaged and crippled for the fall damage

- Motorcycle is as horrible as it has always been. Fun fact for returning players: The 'run on top of the motorcyle while driving it' bug is still there. So it hangs in there for, I don't know... 5 years? 6? No big deal as a bug, but it's cheap it's still there

- Blueprint crafting hangs up and cancels production for no apparent reason (""blueprint is missing or invalid"" or such error), after the 'factory' was fed with all the mats, which in return all go lost (Not funny early in survival mode, this was the point I uninstalled...)

- HV is still sloppy and horrible to drive, especially if equipped with drills (When trying to mine, it gets stuck, falls out the render engine as one sometimes cuts holes into the terrain instead of digging, stucks into rocks' colliders -just like motorcycle or basically, everything-, etc)

- Stories are now random, weightless WTFs. When it all started there were different starting points with 'tutorial stories', in EA quality but I liked them. Those are now gone. It looks like the studio decided to SHIFT+DEL for a solution, rather than fixing them...

- Undead Rufus mentions this but I must emphasize: The game is the very same thing as it was back in 2013, in all aspects. Sloppy anims; extremely dumb, minimal AI; ray cast for firing projectiles (So it hits or misses right at firing, not when the bullet physically lands)... Endless list...



Ages ago I wanted to work for this company. They didn't hire me for I was noob to terrain generation, and couldn't solve this interview task. Bad decision. This game would be super-fun by now, if it was on me :P

I just came back to Empyrion after a long hiatus, thanks to a couple 'spanj' YT vids involving the Reforged Eden scenario made me realize the game had evolved. A lot.

I have a fair amount of time sunk into Empyrion, Elite Dangrous, No Man's Sky, and other space-games. While each game has its charms (well, ""did have"" in the case of ED), Empyrion really has all the best bits all in one place. It's got a silly amount of interesting content, devs are well-known for putting good user-made content into the game, custom ship/base building is fantastic, new gameplay options are great, the community of builders is phenomenal, and the Reforged Eden mod brought so much new life to the game the dev's otta consider making it the default experience.

It still has a way to go to compete with ED for ""excitement of ship-to-ship combat"" (ED does that well), but Empyrion has come a long, long way since I first played. More weapons, more clever AI, and if you play with Reforged Eden -- the ""proper"" way, with mass & cpu restrictions turned on -- the single-player survival experience feels good, and balanced. Reforged Eden really improved, well, everything.

Another thing I've been impressed by is how good the galaxy looks, and how much content it has. Unlike some space games that spawn in random encounters to provide the appearance of variance in a procedurally generated map, the things you run into in Empyrion are actually there, part of the map. You can visit them again, raze them to the ground, build on top of old structures, live inside of hollowed out alien structures, pretty much whatever you want. This lends to the worlds & star-systems feeling much more ""real"" and ""lived in"" than other games.",1499232150,1651171247,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,True

At the time, it had a very brief story and limited destinations. Since then, there have been numerous improvements; however, there still remains much work to be done. I continue to recommend this game and look forward to continuing improvements.

++ I count the choice of If and/or When to activate the Main Story a Big Plus. You could choose to just ""declare total war"" or ""completely ignore"" the resident population of your starting planet and galaxy. This presents enormous possibilities in game play, including to ignore the Main Story completely and basically write your own through interactions with the various factions.

+ Graphics range from fair to excellent, depending on the objects, with surface textures typically ranking highest in resolution.
+ The galaxy now includes hundreds of systems and a dozen different factions.
+ Each of these systems can also include numerous individual planets and other system destinations.
+ Each of the factions now have their own back-story and relationship with the other factions, which provides some additional degree of immersion.
+ Animal AI has been improved to include passive and aggressive species.

-- NPC behavior AI is still quite primitive. They either shoot at your or not. If not, they completely ignore you.
-- Combat AI remains equally primitive, pretty much just charge and shoot. Combat AI for the Planet and System Patrol Vessels appears non-existent, save for shooting at you should it just happen to pass within range.
-- The idle and passive NPC animations are quite limited and of low resolution.
-- The model textures are of lower resolution with obvious polygon appearance at close range.
-- The interactive and dialogue animations are completely non-existent.
-- The vast majority of NPC characters cannot be interacted with nor engaged in dialogue. Story-based NPC characters can only be engaged when their particular part of the story is active. Only the store-keepers can be engaged freely.

EGS evokes the brilliant 7DTD but with important differences.
While 7DTD is focused on surviving the weekly climax a la zombie  horde defense, EGS's more long term chill vibe from survive to thrive, and-critically-explore, presents a less intense experience though no less  rewarding or satisfying experience.

Don't get me wrong, EGS has its moments of episodic terror (those 'aggressive dino's' or the too close for comfort blast from a defense tower to name a few) but they are curtailed and softened by preparation and attention to detail, while 7DTD can crush you at any moment, especially while the player is out scavanging.

Some salient points for DRTL:
UI: intuitive
Gameplay: fun and generally predictable and visually smooth
Pacing: excellent (for what I've played)
POI: moderately engaging
Combat: good and has great potential; aerial is very good so far, the ground could use better opponents (improvements to coding and AI is always welcome but is certainly not limited to just EGS)
Atmosphere: excellent, variety and attention to detail, the vistas, the geomorphology, vegetation, and trees in particularly , are all brilliant, though on some machines may cause some lag issues-this game does require 10gb of ram.

Overall, an excellent experience that can take you places.

It is a very rough and unpolished game, with many features just barely implemented and some just laughable (e.g. water physics).

There are plenty of bugs, saves get corrupted, AI is stupid to the point that it just stands there and takes it while you shoot them in the face. You can not crouch, You can not collect things, you can not paint the map, plot is just walls of text displayed on LCD screens in game.

All of the above was OK when this game was in alpha, but recently developers announced that they are re-labelling current slice (well, how much can they add in a month?) as a ""version 1.0"" and call it a day. They also locked up threads with people criticizing them in favour of other, fresh empty threads, without linking older ones or copying content over. So ridiculously low and silly.

EDIT: Decided to give it another go because I have never tried Reforged Eden and because there was a few patches since 1.0. I have to say that Reforged Eden makes game MUCH more interesting. It definitely saves this game for me, making it actually good and addictive experience.",1546533524,1650873494,True,0,0,0.47856554388999939,0,True,False,False

I felt like I was playing a game from 2010. I'm only on a 1060 so on highest graphics I was seeing around 30 FPS but only around 40-45 on lowest and no matter what I choose it looked dated. The UI also feels rather dated too. 

My decision to refund ultimately happened when I hit my first settlement and the AI was wandering aimlessly with a super slow walking animation. It was like watching roombas move around and bounce off walls. 

My first negative experience: I landed, I died from bleeding or burning because I couldn't figure out making bandages basically because I hadn't picked up my multi-tool. Then respawned and died shortly after from food poisoning somehow even though I never ate anything. 

Oh and the multi-tool. Not being able to move when switching between the modes (which honestly feel pointless to have anyways) irritated the hell out of me when I was running from tiny spider-like aliens trying to flip it onto defensive mode. 

Food spoilage is another point of confusion I had. There's no indication that something is about to spoil that I could see. I could see a perish number but it was just a number and it meant nothing to me. Was it the rate it spoils? How much life left before it's too rotten to eat? I ended up with a ton of spoiled food because I didn't know when it was going to spoil.

Finally, crafting. It does some things right like auto-crafting prereq materials. But hiding everything in sections really is annoying when there's no All section. Most games I'll just search what I want to craft. This game I have to go through each menu to find what I'm trying to build. Just give me an Everything section so I can type in the name and go. 

I agree with the consensus that this still belongs in early access. It just doesn't feel fleshed out. The UI is the biggest gripe I have. All this data is just dumped on you and when you're just learning the ropes it's too overwhelming.",1650852330,1650866914,False,8,1,0.524896919727325439,0,True,False,False

Bad things? Sure, it has some bugs but nothing really game breaking just lots of minor issues that can be annoying at times but can be worked around fairly easy.  The bike is trash... please for the love of all that is Emyrion give us a bike that will steer!!  the graphics are... not good for the most part. Though it has some good points also, space is amazing when you finally get to break the atmosphere. Enemies are one of 2 kinds, amazing snipers that never miss or can't hit the ground if they stuck a gun in the dirt. As for the creatures, they are creepy as **** and the sounds just make it better...or worse depending on how you like it. 

 Now for a few quick good things, a few weapons but they are fairly well balanced and all are useful in their own ways. Just a few tools, but a must to have and makes life much easier.. sometimes you will give up a gun for a good drill! 
 Building hover vehicles, small ships, and capitol ships and the details you can do with it are... just beyond amazing. Can be very overwhelming but the greatest thing about it is you can make blueprints in creative or download them from the workshop and after filling the blueprints with required raw materials you can spawn it in... such a great way to give those less...build skilled a great way to get nice ships without learning a massive amount of engineering. 
  This game has an amazing style, if you love space and being able to move about space and not just from planet to planet but even solar system to solar system this game has NO EQUAL. Spending hours on the starting planet, and when you think the game is getting close to end game... you realize you have scraped 1-50th of the game... then the real scope of it is realized.

There wasn't any kind of tutorial to get started and i had no idea what i got to do. There was just flying around the orbit and the space traveling but nothing much as i remember. As well as the game itself was pretty darn confusing and very complicated for me. Don't get me wrong, i love complex games and love to learn them, as they offer then a huge experience and fun, just about the same as SE offers it.. more or less, but when i got nothing to start off with and i don't have any kind of skilled creativity before i started to play SE, it was already boring and started to regret my choice of even buying it. Anyway, i deemed it ""unworthy"" and tried to get the refund but it was with me 2+ weeks so i couldn't and let it stay there and rot. After years to come only recently i saw the news of Empyrion's update but never bothered to check, then i recalled it that i have it and decided to give Empyrion another go. As i know how SE operates, it has more or less the same basic principle.. but then of course, as i started the game, i am half right. Yes, it does have the block placing similar to SE. No because there are now different kind of rules i have to follow which SE doesn't have it on it's own. I love the idea of bringing up the real survival where you need to eat to survive, watch your body temperature, body buffs and debuffs, except it's now with the ability for you to travel around the Galaxy, explore and loot, build your home/base. It has so much more than i recall that now i have no regrets of even buying Empyrion. Devs have done so much to this game that i've fallen in love with it, and with all my heart i want to apologize publicly for asking a refund. Engine wise if i compare to SE and Empyrion, both have their ups and downs, Empyrion has advantage on exploration and survival while SE excels more at laws of physics along with say pistons, adv motors etc to make trap doors, gates, makeshift vehicles and so on.

In overall: Empyrion - Galactic Survival has taken the cake for marking down all those traits i love on any survival games. If you play SE and you got no idea what's this game is all about, i'd recommend you to try it out. Watch it either on YouTube or from any streamers, if you are like me who loves a good survival game but in space, then you'll feel like home already.

Started out crash landed on a planet.
Built a base.
Built a land speeder.
Built a space vessel.
Left the planet.
Landed on another planet.

There's no other game like it on the store that scratches the itch like Empyrion does. Starting from scratch to building your first base, to making your first hover vessel, then small ship, and exploring the galaxy freely to do as you wish is done very well. Lot's of interaction with objects in your ships, from doors and oxygen management to creating scripts to auto manage the fuel of your ship, it's all here. 

Mods are a massive part of this game, with Reforged Eden completely changing the game and improving upon nearly every single aspect, from building and survival to combat and how small things work. There is a lot of love put into this game, and having an open workshop with thousands of ships and bases to add to your game is just the icing on the cake.

The open world itself is active, with tribes of different factions (Reforged Eden installed) wandering across the land to random attacks on your base from the tribes you've deemed a problem. Ships flying overhead and carrying about their business to bounty hunters and derelict ships waiting for you in space, there is always something to do, and having active multiplayer servers for both vanilla and Reforged Eden add even more bang for your buck. 

Overall, the game is really worth full price, but at the current going rate of $10, you really can't go wrong here. One of my favorite games of the last decade, and being a huge fan of the SciFi genre, Empyrion really does capture Space Combat and Exploration like no other game I've played ever has.

This game is excellent. Yes, there are many things as a player I would change or adapt. But, the essence of the game has always stayed the same and the developers listen and continue to add content after all these years.  It an be an exciting, adventure, slow paced stroll. All the while, you make the choices that keep you alive.....or not.

The building aspects and sense of isolation and scale are very good.  Getting enough resources together to ensure your crops will grow, or you can defend yourself against the next attack is both motivating and frustrating.  

The ship building aspect is great fun, with endless designs by your own hand. Ship building becomes a very personal experience, one that other games would do well to understand.

Multiplayer works well, and really adds to the enjoyment of base building, resource gathering, ship construction, support and team work.

The draw back! - Once you have reached a stage that allows abundance, there really isn't much left to do.  You can be creative with your base or ship building, which is admittedly fun in itself.  But, that is it.  Enemies are easily killed off, especially in multiplayer and survival aspects are no longer a problem.  Every planet starts to be the same and the enjoyment begins to dwindle.  A new phase of challenges to keep the game fresh and keep you in check as supreme master of all things Empyrion, to a humble, please don't kill me noob. 

Occasionally, you might bugger yourself up in an accident or become stranded on a planet - which if in single player is extremely frustrating. But, otherwise you just get a friend to pick you up.

Finally, is the teleport - Effectively rendering ships useless. You can simply move from one site to another.  Good and even useful for a while.  But, once you have everything, there is nothing to do. 

I guess what I am saying is, there is a lot of fun and adventure to be had with this game. It's just all over too quickly once you know how to play it.

I wholeheartedly recommend it, and if you're worried about my words sounding like it gets boring - It doesn't.  It's a game to get lost in and enjoy at your own pace, while allowing you to be creative.  Empyrion manages to capture some really good aspects of survival and construction, of which so many other ""flashy"" space survival games simply overlook..

Also it gives you options for revenge when someone attacks you, lots of options that may take weeks to carry out.  That is where the game is at its best in my mind, being a player who doesn't want to *start* fights.

What would make the game perfect is more of  ""Firefall"" mode where an AI director is taking over the map and players have to band together if they want to stop it from taking over a system.

It's good enough that I want to keep going even though I need to build up to survive the next chapter.  Vehicles & bases are handled well too, and there's a good progression from when you start out, to the point when you finally mine the materials that let you unlock the last few advanced bits.  The build menu also allows a lot of different shapes and laying them out is fairly easy to work with once you figure it all out.

The game is pretty good in giving you several paths to progress for building and crafting.  You can buy ores you need for building if you don't want to mine them.  You get them as loot, if you like raiding.  You also can scavenge base parts off places you've beat, and off wrecked ships in space.   Or you can quickly level up and mine and build what you want.

The game has a bit unfinished feel to it though.  In several of the story missions, I had to quit and reload to get the enemies to spawn like they were supposed to.  I'm also stuck with the game thinking I haven't started chapter 2.  Once I complete it, it just resets somehow, but it hasn't stopped me from continuing on.  Weapons and armor for combat on foot also doesn't have a great sense of progression as well.  You can craft second level weapons, but the components are rare.  By the time you get it, you probably will have found second level weapon anyway, or even a third level weapon.  Armor has 4 levels, but you can only craft the first level and buy the second level.  The last two have to be looted, but they share the same loot pool that the weapons do.  So you might get lucky and get a high level armor on your first raid, or get really unlucky and hit up several areas and come up empty.  That's currently where I'm stuck.

Another negative for me is the save system.  The game auto saves frequently on whatever save you load, so if you quit or die, you'll be right at the point that you left.  You have to remember to make a ""backup save"" periodically.  If you reload a backup save, you need to remember to either copy it or make another ""backup save"" right away.  I lost quite a bit of progress because I forgot to make a backup for a while, and quit for the night.  When I logged back in, I was floating in space and the ship I was flying was no where to be seen.  I was able to revert, but I lost seven hours of progress.",1649465163,1649465163,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

A much more interesting world. Interesting places to find, factions to interact with.
You build, pick up and place down blocks directly, no scaffolding and resource ferrying required.
Symmetry mode isn't just a creative feature.
You need food to survive, as well as regulate your temperature. 
Does not have the moving parts of space engineers, no pistons, rotors or hinges. Does have big gate blocks and the like though.
Has a story(such as it is) 

These are up to preference. Here are some of the less fortunate things.
The game is quite janky, and a lot of the assets feel like they were bought,  the art style isn't super consistent. 
Enemy AI is pretty bad.
Non-ship enemies will often spawn out of thin air from enemy spawners, you're exploring an abandoned base and suddenly you're surrounded by crabs or monsters that seemed to come from no where.
A lot of enemy ships don't adhere to the same rules as you when it comes to flying, they'll change direction suddenly mid air, so regular proper dog fights are generally out of the question.
Enemies despawn very fast, so you'll often have to take dumb risks in combat to loot them instead of finishing off their friends first and doing so afterwards.
The worst offender is probably the save system. The dev seems overly concerned with online cheating, and as such the game will always autosave onto the active save. You can't make a new save like a normal game before trying anything risky. You have to make a backup of your current save file. And if you want to load an earlier save you'll have to load that one. Any active save will constantly be overwritten, even if you close the game from the task manager. 

Meaning if you want to try out something risky, either combat or just building something you're not sure will collapse or explode, you'll have to take great care to juggle backup saves, or you'll be stuck with whatever happens. Which is extremely annoying when you're just playing singleplayer and don't constantly want to rebuild entire ships. There are ways to get around it, but it really shouldn't be as awkward as it is, no other sane games do it like this.",1649359078,1649359078,True,0,1,0,0,True,True,False

Survival: 8/10: There are survival elements here, but once you learn how to play the game, it's not difficult at all, until you end up on an extreme gravity world with a toxic atmosphere, my point is, there's always a challenge.

Building: 12/10: The freedom to build how you want and what you want is endless, truly endless, want a Borg Cube? Yeah I've done that, want a cool space ship? Yep, done that too. You can build a ship from scratch from a single block or download a model and then input the resources and spawn it in. Want to build a super massive base on a planet to serve as your capital, yeah no problem. Want a small hut, yep doable. with the building system you can place up to 15-20 blocks at a time simply by dragging your mouse, so the building In fact, building wise, this is the best game I've come across, and I'm a builder, so just about any game that has a building system out there, I own, or I've played. Really, this game sets the standard, all other games should be using the system this one does, at least the ones with block building system. Now let me be clear, it's not just blocks you can build with, there is variety here, but the way they snap together is ultimately in a block system, yes there's curves and whatnot which your character will react to, like slipping off, but how they connect is in a x/y/z block point. 

Graphics: 5/10 Not great, you won't see any unreal 5 engine stuff here, but the fun and repeat-ability more than makes up for it.

Sound: 5/10: average at best, lots of generic laser blaster and machine gun sounds with little variety

Weapons: 5/10: the variety is there, but more like just upgraded version of the same basic 6 or 7 weapons. I wish there was more options for space weapons, to count, there's machine gun turrets, cannons, laser and plasma guns(basically the same just one is different color and more powerful) and then missile based systems (missiles and torpedoes). There's shield systems for your ships so your hand crafted ship won't melt at the first encounter, but the shield systems themselves could be better, like being able to link them together to make a stronger shield system, to my knowledge, that's not a thing yet, it's one system despite the size of your ship. which can be irritating when you have a Borg Cube(Again yes I've done this) the size of 400x400x400 blocks vs that small carrier also a capital ship maybe the size of 60x20x10 blocks

Fun to be had: 9.5/10: So the X factor here with this game is the mods as well as the ships put out by the community, you can in fact download all kinds of models it appears people have taken great pleasure in getting just right, want your favority Star Wars or Star Trek ship, yeah, you'll probably be able to find it, download it, then build it in-game once you put in the resources and spawn it in. 

Endurance: 8/10: Once you've established a multi-solar empire and have auto-miners harvesting the resources you need, the sky's the limit with what you can build, I actually built a stupid looking model of the Star Trek Enterprise, so massive it was like 25K blocks, each placed by hand, and the number of laser cannons, yeah simply awesome.

Overall: 9 / 10, for around 19.99 it's certainly not a bad deal if you're a guy/gal that likes to scratch your building itch with all those other elements I said mixed in, once again, once you setup a small empire with teleporters and auto-miners, resources won't be an issue and you can build to your heart's desire. The graphics are rather simplistic compared to more deep pocket developers, understand that, but all the other elements easily make up for it. 

Simply:
If the game is on sale, this is a MUST BUY! I don't think I've ever said that about any other game, if so, extremely rarely.

More in-depth on the game play:
So, you start the game crash landing onto a planet, from there you will gather resources and begin building your base while, if you're smart, doing missions for the locals, or you could exterminate them and steal their resources to make your own. Now if you choose that route and there's still some of those local primitives left on the planet, expect them to come after you, but of course, you'll have a blaster gun and they'll have spears, so.... Eventually you'll find the evil empire on the planet, which you'll realize they're everywhere throughout the galaxy. You'll gather resources to make a small warp drive that'll let to go to other planets in the system and eventually you'll build a capital ship that'll have the warp capability to go to other star systems, each owned by a different faction or simply owned by the evil empire race. Eventually you'll find that evil empire has within it other factions you can support. The game world is randomly generated, the planets are randomly generated as well as resources placement, with the exception of the starting planet, there's enough there to get you going. So each time you start the game brand new, it'll be a different experience, only a few small moons and rocks in your solar system, restart! Now a gas giant with 3 moons, and other planets with a double sun system. Eventually, you'll establish a multi-solar empire of your own, having bases on multiple planets and teleporters linking each with auto-miners harvesting those precious resources you can only find on that lava world with extreme gravity or that moon with almost no gravity, or that world with a green skyline and toxic atmosphere. With multiplayer, expect massive space battles, in single player, expect every new solar system and planet have it's own challenges, from hostile aliens with capital ships to planets with impressively hostile ground to air laser cannons. I've made the mistake more than once of being too confident thinking, ""Ok, this will be another sweep and clear operation this planet is nothing special"" only to have 8 laser cannons open up on me and tearing a literal hole through my hand crafted favorite small attack drop ship ship and me fleeing like a soy boy all out of his favorite soy latte and then creeping in cautiously and advancing much more slowly to destroy my enemies or that time I invaded that enemy base thinking it was just a small outpost only to find it expanded nearly 10 stories underground and was part of some secret experiments and was filled with all kinds of hidden auto-turrets and enemies all over the place looking to kill me. The developers continue to update this game and clearly have a passion to continue making it better and better, that's great for future development.


Review updated on 04 Apr 22:


I loved playing this game with my younger son; unfortunately, he passed away suddenly on 13 March 2022 in a vehicle accident. I will always remember the fun we had together in this game, those memories are now special to me, if you're playing with people you care about, this game is one of those where you can build together and work toward a common goal, it will be memorable, for $20, that's priceless.",1631380874,1649066262,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A couple of month ago Empyrion left the ALPHA / Early Access tag behind but there are still some things that make it feel like a game in Alpha or at least Beta period. As there are:

-Bugs, they are still there they slowly become less but be prepared that some of them will stay for a long time with us. Nothing that is game crushing but it could destroy an evening or two of yours.
-Players avatar is really ugly and not able to take cover, to prone, to lean, or to duck. This might change in the future but no one knows when.
-Sound if you need good Sounds to enjoy a game you are wrong here. The music is fine but the sound effect are not even close to well adjusted.
-Graphics: In this game you build everything out of Blocks. So it might happen that your Graphics Card has to calculate hundred of thousands of blocks. And a couple of thousands of those are probably moving, and then they might get hit by a rocket and etc the result of this is, the graphic of this game is fine if your GPU can manage it but don't expect 4k gameplay or anything close to it.

I think that are the biggest bummers for most of the people, for fairness here some good things:
-It is like digital Lego! But better because the blocks can be painted textured and there are more blocks that have a special funktion! That's lit! Most of my 3000 Hours i spent building stuff. You inner child, inner builder, and sometimes even your inner engineer gonna be very pleased.
-It is great that you can shoot some Zirax between building, even as it obviously cannot compete to a shooters game.
-The devs wanted to combine building, shooting, and survival in a single game, right now the building is the stronges, and shooting the weakest part. And once you got the game the survival part would become boring as well, if there wouln't be custom scenarios and servers where they give the survival experience back to the long time players. =)
-Fighting with your ship vs other players can be a real challenge and fun. But with tanks vs buildings in a defender vs attackers situation is best.
-The workshop of this game is full ov wonderful creative and stunningly beatiful builds. Sometimes it looks like an art gallery.
-There are some servers and scenarios (aviable in the workshop) that give you a totally different game experience. Thanks to hundreds of work hours players invested on their own.

Last but not least i have to mention your entry in this game might not go as smooth as you wish for it. But give it time, since a couple of weeks there is actually a kinda helpfull tutorial. There are tons of explanation videos on youtube some of them are even specialliced on just basic building. And if everything breaks down the community is pretty friendly and helpful around here. Just give it a try on a server right away or go to the forum website.
Cheers and maybe see you soon...

The premise of the game is great and it cna be very enjoyable to play with friends and family. I'm a PvE player myself, opting to host a dedicated server that we play on together to raid POIs and such.

The building system is great and has a massive selection of block shapes.

The technology and progression are ok. Personally, I prefer the mod Reforged Eden to the vanillay tech tree and progression.

What I don't like....

The AI for drones and ground enemies is terrible. They try to cover this up by using zerg tactics but the AI is horrible. Again, Reforged Eden mod makes this better.

There are bugs. That's understandable for a EA/Alpha game. The problem I have with it is that the game has been out and playable now for a long time and many of the bugs have been reported long ago but the devs haven't acknowledged the bugs or fixed them.

For example, when flying to a new planet you enter the atmosphere in the new small vessel you scraped and salvaged and farmed for hours to build.. and the game crashes or you get disconnected from the server. When you log back in your ship is gone and you're high in the atmosphere and falling to your death... either you die and have to respawn back at your base (if you have one) or else start again.

If you somehow manage to survive, you're now seriously injured, on another planet that most likely doesn't have a breathable atmosphere and have no materials and no way home.  All your hard work is gone - wasted.

This particular bug has been happening since 2016 and still happens to this day.

Would I recommend this game... ?

For single player & coop - yes.

For server play, not really. The risk of losing hours or days of work due to a disconnect or random crash is just too annoying.",1534161049,1648841885,True,0,0,0.489988625049591064,0,True,False,True

I figured I could overlook that.  Game seemed fun.  Then I got into space and started facing enemy ships.  This game is practically unplayable at that point.  Laser drones hit and damage you ages before the actual animation of the laser reaches your ship...  that right there is a game breaking bug.

Decided to try the game again, see if anything had improved since 1.0.

Turns out, I came at the wrong time apparently, they had introduced a bug with a basic building feature, which was the cause of the constant clipping issues. It's been fixed since.
Other issues found their fix as well, leaving with a playable game. It's not polished by any mean, but good enough to let the main feature shine, and that's ship building + PvE.

Not to mention the difficulty differences between fighting certain factions in space.

With game breaking bugs and glitches, I've had enemies spawn in the terrain allowing them to freely shoot and kill me with no recourse. As well as having times where they'd destroy my hover vessel as they spawn deep underground. Then there are times in POI where laser turrets can shoot and track me through walls, killing me with no way of countering. But one of the bugs that caused me to uninstall, was the bug where I left my CV in a 4G planet with all my vessels securely docked, only to find out upon leaving that the large majority of my vessels were missing. Having re-entered the planet, I then found that they had disappeared into the core of the planet making retrieval impossible. 

For POI designs, as if certain POI creators have developed a bitter hatred for players, it appears as if the theme of creating a POI is merely slapping turrets and hidden turrets in every room and calling it a job well done. Not to mention the love of adding invisible/back spawners, where upon entering a room there would be a flood of mobs spawning and rushing you. Or alternatively, clearing a room only to get backspawned by a shotgun enemy when someone steps a foot into the next area. I've personally witnessed a mob spawn right on my back as I was standing on a container waiting for my friend to push into to aggro the next pack of mobs. With how resources are and how POIs are created, the optimal strategy to clear POIs has essentially boiled down into building a tunneling vessel, dig underneath the POI, shoot and destroy the shields and clear a way into the bottom of the POI allowing for players to have an easier time destroying either the generators or the core, while leaving the precious turrets and other objects free to scavenge. 

As an example to the difficulty difference whereas the pirate faction is a complete and utter joke to encounter, with their CVs putting up no challenge and their designs an afterthought. The Zirax Empire instead has extremely well placed and shielded cores with no indication as to where their weakness would lie. This in turn makes it extremely frustrating for a new player to figure out how to core a Zirax CV, more often than not the end result would be a Zirax ship being completely destroyed with nothing of value left and massive amounts of ammo wasted. To make matters worse there is a bug in coop/multiplayer where ships would de-sync with the server causing them to be invisible unless the player leaves and rejoins and play field or relogs. This bug then causes the player to be unable to core or attack the ship with manual weapons, as they are invisible.  Which then leaves the player with little to no recourse but to retreat, repair and resupply. 

With those frustrating issues as well as others that has most likely slipped my mind, I would not be able to recommend this game unless you are patient with the many different bugs and glitches that will occur as well as having a tolerance towards extremely mediocre graphics and fluctuating/low framerates (I have a 3080 with a 5600x as well as 32GB of ram on an ssd, so it can't be my computer's issue.) as you progress further with larger CVs.",1467718189,1647505904,False,1,0,0.507328987121582031,0,True,False,False

It has a lot of positives. You can build a lot.  The blueprinting is good.  The bases you assault can be interesting, if extremely hard.  They have a good game progression, splitting the stages between on foot, HV, SV, CV, multi-planet.

The game gets almost unplayable laggy near spawned in structures.  There save games get wiped when you use them, with no auto save.  When you crash, you sometimes get transported back 4 hours if you have forgotten to save.  The building of larger ships is a major struggle when it doesn't need to be.  The graphics are bad and have not improved.  The sound design is terrible, honestly. Multiplayer really struggles due to the lag problems.  It has a fucking terrible interface for so much.  Like I don't know how you could make some parts of the interface worse.  The AI is extremely uneven, sometimes aiming for your ship, sometimes for you, sometimes engaging you, sometimes moving at random.

I've been playing since early beta, where it was better, but now it is just worse and worse and worse.  It needs an overhaul in a major way and it gets minor patches because I think they made their money from it already.

I got this game a long time ago and saw it grow by returning every few month. In my humble opinion, all the updates are going in the right direction and i cannot wait to see more. 

I won't lie, the survival part of the game is a bit lacking as well as graphics (espacially animations). 

But to me, the sandbox aspect is *amazing* and allows you to build almost anything you want. I spent so far over a thousand hours in this mode creating, designing, building, painting ships and bases. Your imagination is the limit.


Pros : 
- The creative mode, sandboxe that allows you to build with infinite ressources and time, publish your work and import it into your playthrough
- Game updates
- Multiplayer
- The infinity of the universe to explore
- The steam worskhop support : there is a solid community of very creative people producing amazing content 

Cons :
- Survival mode, despite lot of update it still lacking endgame goals.
- Graphics and more specifically the animations of players and ennemies.
- The infinity of the universe, it becomes a bit repetitive towards the end game, and you will get bored as a solo player.


All in all the sandbox / building mode of the game is worth every penny. If you want to design crazy stuff, buy this game.",1647341144,1647341144,True,8,0,0.570991337299346924,0,True,False,False

Empyrion has its flaws like the player movement is clunky, you can't walk through your ship while it is moving, and some of the wonky creatures and their models/movement are also lower quality. Aside from that, what you have is a FINISHED galaxy to explore, build ships and bases, survive space and planetary environments. You can fight different races, defend your base from attacks, explore, battle through POI's, and so much more. 

I have tried all types of different modern space sims/open world type games and they all scratch different parts of the itch but this one scratches more of that itch then the rest and that is the reason for my positive review. 

The devs are also still releasing regular large updates that are improving the ""cons"" I have for this game. They have announced they are working on newer and improved models for creatures as well as the player and the player character's movement.

There are quite a few pros and cons in my opinion, I will try to make this review brief, to make you able to generate an overall picture.
As a summary: this is a good survival/builder game but a pretty bad adventure game.
Pros:
- good harvesting and building mechanism; both having nice development in it as you progress from common resources to rare ones, from simple survival tools to advanced devices. I never stop being excited when designing a new CV (¬mothership, mobile home base)
- nice looking visuals, especially planets and space; the sunset from your own built living room, especially on a environmentally hostile planet can be quite a view
Cons:
- combat, in general, is BAD. Does not look good, does not feel good, uninteresting and annoying.  Because:
 - weapons and their usage is just bad. Handheld weapons are the worst, turrets are sort of 
 OK. Mothership ""space only"" weapons are simply unfair (enemy can shoot them on planets, 
 why can't i?). Projectile travel speed... is SLOW. Actually, there are only bows and arrows in this game, even if they look like miniguns and laser rifles.
 - Npc/monster movement, enemy behavior in general is horrible, It is about the level of Doom 
 v1 (1993...). NO, actually worse. They run towards you, sidestepping randomly (add this to slow projectile speed... you miss a lot), once they reach you they almost move INTO you and hit you, typically infecting you with something that is very bad for you. OR they shoot at you
from so far away that you see only a few pixels from them...
 - Sounds are insanely bad as well. I multiple times attacked the friendly villagers because of 
 the horrible groans they emitted. Only slightly less antagonizing that of the necrosis-causing 6  legged overseer enemy that can kill you in three hits.
 
- the ""scenarios"" (sort of built-in adventures) are more like a horror FPS for me, a very bad one even for that. Poorly illuminated rooms, monsters spawning right before/after/on you, sometimes in minature sizes, running around in lightning speed, jumping on walls, pretty much each of them infecting you with some quick progressing disease in case they hit you... etc. 
-I understand that all the ""quests"" must have been done with a reduced toolset, but at the moment this is simply not enough to entertain. Go here, press the button, go there, listen to NPC, finished. No real rewards, no progression in anything, no puzzles (albeit this is a builder game after all...).

So, every now and then, I install Empyrion, start a game form scratch, build my base, build my ships, visit a few star systems, hoard all mats that i can put my hands on and thats it. Once you properly develop a CV, there is no reason to attack anyone, because ... combat is not fun and it is also pretty pointless. You do not get even nice explosions. Scenarios... I do not play them because they are not good.",1647290512,1647291464,True,46,0,0.795548617839813232,0,True,False,False

The player is immortal, which means this isn't a game at all, because games can be won or lost. Empyrion is a toy, not a game. Here, there is no way to lose. Just play with the toy and if you play long enough your reward is that you get to see more content. The whole game design offers players one option: grind for content.

Some players like to grind for content and avoid games where the player has a chance to fail. This game might satisfy that kind of player and that kind of player may even give it a thumbs up.

However, there are other players who require the challenge of coping with and finding ways to reduce risk in the pursuit of reward. You can't die in this universe, even on the most hellish planets infested with murder drones. Shame. You've robbed me of the consequences that would have given meaning to my successes.

Which is a shame, because it does has some good elements, but as you play, the bad will grind you down till in the end and you will wish you had never started to waste your time and money.  

I actually purchased the game back in Aug 2018, it was still in Alpha, and for me, in an unplayable state, so I uninstalled.  Since then there have been (not counted) but hundreds of updates and patches.  So, a few weeks ago, I thought I would give the game another go in the hope that it had matured into a playable state.  I was so wrong.

Today, and since Aug 2021, Eleon Game Studios advertise the game as a full release.  Since that release there have been in excess of 20 updates, patches and hotfixes.  Many of these have required full wipes of game saves and servers, causing the player to restart from the beginning.  In addition, updates have also caused steam workshop (and non workshop) scenarios and mods to fail and stop working.  

The minimum hardware requirements have also gone through the roof over this time.  They claim minimum 10gb RAM, recommended 16GB.  I have 16GB and was met with out of memory messages a number of times, and be sure, I had nothing other than steam running in the background.  For a £9.99 game you will probably need to spend in excess of £2,500 on hardware to play it.

The story and tutorials are still incomplete, and you will grind yourself through the story only to be met with a message saying still in development.  

You will encounter AI and NPC’s that fall through floors and shoot through walls and even fly through entire planets.  You will get hangs and freezes and disconnects that will leave you light years from your ship when you reconnect, with the only option of death and the hope you can respawn back at your base.  Else it is start again time.  

I would still describe this game as alpha.  

A lot of the vanilla content is so weak, that if you do wish to continue playing, you will be tempted to download and play one of the workshop scenarios.  Reforged Eden is probably the most popular, but be prepared to still be met with untold bugs, unfinished stories but most of all, some pretty horrendous politics between the scenario writers and the players, where if you, the player, manage to outsmart the POI’s using legal in game mechanics, they will call you a cheat and next update, nerf your build and buff their precious POI’s.  You are not meant to win at this game, it is just an ego trip for the devs to get one over on YOU, the paying player.  And to top it off, if you join one of the private servers, be sure you will likely encounter ‘pay to win’ subscriptions.  

There are also non-workshop scenarios that you can choose to download, Ascension Unchained comes to mind, where the scenario is clearly and completely plagiarized from Reforged Eden and thus removed from the workshop, and if you choose to post a youtube of yourself playing one of these scenarios, be ready for some negative and childish comments from the devs.  Like you are a lawyer and it’s your fault, right?  

To summarise, this game is far from ready to be called a release.  If you are the kind of person who likes to test and report bugs, prepared to have your game wiped and start again on a regular basis, plus you can handle the fan bois telling you the game is perfect and its your PC that sux, hostility from server owners who cannot handle the pressure of being constantly hounded about bugs and issues.  Go for it.  Otherwise, pah, you don’t need me to tell you how to suck eggs.  Good luck, have fun.",1646756584,1646756584,False,21,2,0.502756416797637939,0,True,False,False

NOTE:
If this is below average why am I giving this a thumbs up? Normally, I reserve games that score a 5/10 the personal swing choice of a thumbs up or thumbs down. But this warrants a special case. While I would describe this game as a ""Jack of all but master of none"" there is the more engaging game in the niche Voxel Sandbox Space Games sub-genre. Most of the others like this I would score even less as they have close to nothing to keep you engaged. In the grand scheme of games it is below average, for those starved of a good space survival voxel sandbox game, this is probably one of the best to be offered.

Summary
There is a little bit of everything here. Needs more depth to each game play mechanic/system. Exploration is the thing that is most rewarding. It could use quite a bit of polish and can feel ""ametuer"". However plenty hours of fun can still be had, especially with mods.

Content: 1/2
When it comes to a space game, this game has a LITTLE bit of everything and it has quite a few different things to try, the problem here though is that it feel like it is the size of an ocean but as deep as a puddle. Plenty of planet types and POIs but only so many things to mine or attain. There is base attacks but they are repetitive and simple. Many more examples of these ""weak implementations"".

Engagement: 1/2
For a voxel based sandbox space game I would give this a 2/2 especially when comparing to most of the others. But in the context of games in general  I have to give this a 1/2.

There are plenty of ""jolts"" in the game that keep you going; moments where you feel there is more to try and check out. There are plenty of systems to visit and things to see. The exploration alone is enough to keep you engaged while all of the rest engages you for a little while, then stops or you complete them with ease. The exploration is the true glue in this game.

You do quickly hit an area where it becomes very much a sandbox game where you have to make your own fun, and there are plenty of options that you can always find something to do.

Experience: 1/2
While not game breaking all of the time, there are plenty of bugs and glitches you will be sure to run across along your way. However, there is still some kind of charm this game has most of the time that makes me feel that my experience was somehow worth it.

The experience is fun, but you know all along the way that it could use polish. The inclusion of mod support really allows this game to be more enjoyed. I highly recommend playing with the Reforged Eden scenario mod.

Game Play: 1/2
Again, there is a little bit of everything here, but each leaves you with wanting a bit more. The combat, while giving you an extra thing to do and feel, it is very simple. Trading while it exists, is quite flawed and not exciting. The tech tree gives something to strive for, but quickly you run through it or can completely undermine it with blueprints. The voxel ship building has many block types yet there is no logic to set up, conveyers, or pipes to feed things. It is sufficient enough, however.

Style: 0/2
My biggest problem with this game is that the visuals and audio is kind of ugly. Many things, especially NPCs, feel like lazy public assets, don't fit at all, or feel completely random.",1646690570,1646690949,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

My main complaint is that you dont or I dont know how to claim your planet or system, I would like to see after hundreds of hours that I have a named place that is my safe place, planet or system or multiple systems, eveyone else gets a bubble with a name and color to show their ownership. With no solid goals, taking over and expanding is a self made goal many of us have but no labels of your ownership, I conquered this whole system really I did, .....I could play this game 1000 hours if I had goal or could take over a section like the other factions get to and I think you can claim land and planets and systems in online game, just not single. probably a great game to go online and get into a group or clan also.

Update: 3/4/22 I have been looking for a game as good as this one but with some kind of end goal. After hundreds of dollars and dozens of game, my conclusion is I have not found anything that comes close. I would like to have a few AI mates to help with battles and maybe a 3-5 ship group to battle the big boys in space, but I have not found anything that isnt timed or a puzzle or nothing to do but build and survive the ""elements"" out there. 

I like to build a base, move out and expand. rts are timed to drive you crazy to find the right order of building before that enemy comes and you find hours later that you didnt do something right in the begging and have to start over. Men of war is close and is my favorite right next to Total war games, but this game is much more personal and you have to do the heavy lifting your self. 

I would say after close to a $1000 bucks in last two years looking for that great game...Red Dead two, Wild lands, Total war, Men of war, and Empyrion pretty much make up for the other 150 games that were a disappointment or waste of time and money, coming from someone who spent close to 500 hours playing this game that has no real end goal. 

The good reviews are on the money imo, dont go online so cant speak to that, when I was younger I played cod with every spare minute, now I am older and I really cant find anything as good at MOW AS2 or TW or Empyrion. Ultimate Admiral Civil War was great but looks old now, like me.

They recycle so many skins I am waiting for some prealpha skins to come back. Heres the roadmap for 2022....the meat and potatoes is NEW SKINS!
Version 1.8 & 1.8.5
For the big summer update 1.8 there are several major topics on the agenda!

First and foremost, we will be adding completely new models for NPCs and creatures that will soon be roaming the worlds of Empyrion. At the same time, we also plan to revamp some of the NPCs and creatures currently in use, replacing them with new and revised models that fit in with the general visual overhaul of the planets.

Apart from that, we will technically fully integrate the new decoration system that we have shown as an example in the last versions. In 1.8 we will revise the planets and partly completely redesign them so that they can unfold their potential in the light of the new possibilities. This includes new, but also revised models for decoration, rocks, harvestables and resources (e.g. Rock resources on the surface).

Another focus will be improvements to the UI, to various help and display systems and a partly completely new game start.

In conjunction with that, 1.8 will continue to be worked on in numerous other areas. In addition to bug fixes, work on the code base is planned to make the game fit for the next updates and game content. Some Quality of Life and Convenience will also be in focus.

We will publish more information about this in the next few weeks on the way to the experimental release!
For version 1.8.5, the focus will then be on new playable content, missions and activities that will build on the innovations of 1.8. Fixing bugs is, of course, always part of the plan.

Version 1.9
The year-end update will be all about the player avatar, its appearance, its movement possibilities and related functions and features! The update will not only change some settings, but will be a complete rework!

This means a considerable intervention in the code base (which is currently already being prepared) and will challenge all departments in the team due to the deep integration of the functions of the player controller in features and gameplay. However, we are sure that the effort is worth it and that we will be able to present you with a completely renewed combat and movement feeling including numerous new gameplay features at the end of the year.

If you are a builder, do not play this game unless you want everything you make to get wiped away eventually, and sooner than you like. There are no persistent servers, not even HWS. Yes you can make blueprints, but when the wipes come you will have to start from nothing to make all the resources to build back your blueprints. This game is only for building stuff to destroy and throw away. Too bad, because the construction system is excellent. But everything you make will be ephemeral.

I keep coming back to Empyrion because its construction system is unequaled for now, except maybe Conan Exiles (which isn't in space). You can design and build what you want piece-by-piece. But I keep moving on again because is it bland and lifeless. The graphics need a major facelift; they don't stand up to any recent space game. The alien sounds could be replaced by something that isn't nails-on-a-chalkboard. It needs a talented artist to design a variety of aliens and professional animations. Every mob's arms are stiff akimbo like they are ready to gunfight, no matter what they are actually doing. Add to that boring and entirely predictable AI. The game ups the challenge by making enemies severely lethal, not clever. Once you are in the line-of-sight of an enemy base, ship, or mob, you have about one millisecond to react, pretty much getting one-shotted constantly. There are no tactics other than having superior firepower to get your instant kill in first. On the other hand, I discovered the best way to approach any armed AI structure on foot is to drill a tunnel beneath it and attack destroy its core or guns from below, but if you pop your head up, you're dead.

There's a learning curve, but even if building or designing stuff isn't your bag and you just want to wreck some alien goop-sacks the community has a plethora of interesting and downright amazing blueprints on the workshop that you can just pop into your game, build, and spawn  in and rock and roll.

Just an opinion statement but avoid Nitrado servers, if you are United States and west coast, I am closest to Los Angles Servers. Honestly constant disconnects and I have lost multiple resources that took days due to a disconnect mid input on a blueprint. 

Finally I will say this, Space games like these are fun and challenging and more than once i have lost a full ship. Don't be discouraged! head back and rebuild and learn and move forward! It is tempting to throw in the the towel but your first run into space, your first visit to another planet, to all the planets in your system and then to other galaxies is worth the time and effort! Don't be afraid to use the workshop. With a little research you can find a ""cost"" effective miner, or Small Vessel that will make or break your play time. Be cautious of enemy bases because they don't miss ;) Use your little drone miner with the F5 key and have fun!

[list]
    [*] instant factory time (no delays once I gather the mats)
    [*] slow food and oxygen burn (default rate is more of a nuisance than fun)
    [*] default enemy difficulty for whatever base setting I go with (medium)
    [*] rich planets with more and larger ore veins
    [*] auto miners that never run out (still require fuel)

Things I wish I could modify: corpse decay timer, sometimes I can't quite get back to my avatar in time and lose precious materials in survival mode.

I'd love to run around mining and building and managing my own little corner of the galaxy.  I'm sure that portion of the game is great.  I wouldn't know, however, as I found the game tutorial so frustrating I couldn't even get off world.  The pacing of the tutorial is fine and ordinarily wouldn't cause any frustration, the issue is the goal tracking.  This game makes you do everything. in order. without exception.  When getting the comms unit up and running I had to build the small generator three times.  The first because I knew it was coming and built it ahead of time.  Again when I place it before placing the T1 tank, and therefore the game wasn't ready for it and didn't register the completion, and one last time to finally placate the game into allowing me to proceed.  

Games can have rough tutorials and weird goal completion detection, I've run into that before.  However, Empyrion's goal completion detection system ruins the experience for me.  After I finally got the comms tower working and got the datalogs, I went to the native village and agreed to help them with some ancient ruins.  Apparently the place was spawning spiders and they wanted it to stop. fair enough.  I agree to help, get given a flamethrower, and them proceed to literally kill enough of them with fire to get into the structure.  I open a door, go down a ramp, and find that I can't proceed any further.  As it turns out, I hadn't killed *enough* spiders.  And as it turns out, the way into the ruins features a hole you just jump in, and cannot jump back out.  To top it all off, you're not allowed to build or destroy any piece of the ruins for obvious reasons, leaving me stranded with no other recourse but to starve myself to death but sprinting around the room.

I can't comment on the rest of the game past that point, so I won't.  it might be good, it might be bad, but the game thus far has left me far too frustrated after the past few attempts to bother getting off world to see.",1644695891,1644695891,False,6,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

base building
ship building
vehicle building
it all works in the exact same way. its easy and its fun

the scale of the game is huge! very much to explore and gather. but it really feels empty... like you are the only sentient being out there.....

Cons
AI... pretty much nonexistent. very stupid enemies who have a hard time navigating their own base

Bugs... everywhere.... dont look up the game will bug.. dont look down the game will bug..
dont move your vehicle your game might bug... dont shoot that enemy the game might bug...

story/quests. very lame and tame quests wich ofcourse bug out if you dont do EXACTLY what the developers intended.

i bought this game way back when it just came out.. put it on the shelf after fumbling with it.
figured i would come back when they expand on it...
now i am back 4 years later... nothing has changed....
at least nothing noticable...
wich means the dudes that created the actual game here probably moved on to something else
and left some interns to deal with this. spewing out weak stuff instead of actually expanding on the game. or fixing the damn dumb AI.

You crash land on the planet of your choosing (from easy earth-like planets to hellish, hostile, barren moons), and start trying to gtfo of the starting solar system in search of dank treasures and more powerful crafting materials to beef up your ships.

Yes, that's right, [b] STARTING [/b] solar system. 

As far as I can tell the universe is never ending, but even if i'm mistaken and it's not, then are [i] millions [/i] of different systems. Each have their own planets. moons, space stations, and asteroids to explore. All procedurally generated. All filled with random points of interest (POIs).

The POIs range from crashed ships (yes you can excavate and salvage them for parts and loot) to ancient temples full of traps, and even abandoned factories and shipyards (yes you can repair, take over, and inhabit these bases).

You get to these places via custom-built, modular space craft with the help of your personal drone! F5 spawns the little guy in which is essentially just the flying version of yourself. Fight, build, mine, and scout with it! Or if you're not the building/creative type, you can download blueprints from the workshop (or pick a default ship that comes with the game) and work toward spawning them in. F2 opens a blueprint menu. Pick your ship, gather the ores required, submit them, and wait (F2 menu can be turned off in pvp). You can even edit the ships however you like once they are in game! Getting to space is as simple as you want it to be!

So there's a lot of stuff to explore around here! You're not gonna get to just fly around all willy-nilly without a care in the universe though (unless you're playing creative :P ). No, not if the hostile environments, wildlife, space pirates, Zirax (space vikings), enemy players, and/or any of the factions you have pissed off have anything to say about it. They have bases, fighters, soldiers, ships, and space stations of their own everywhere. Murder them all or befriend them and trade an INSANE amount of goods with them. You can even do a buuuunch of different types of missions for them. Get space rich or die tryin', by any means... I like that!

This sounds awesome dude, what's the catch?

The game is a bit.. janky.. from time to time..

The graphics aren't great. Not horrible by any means... But not great. The transition from planet to space is not seamless. It takes a good 3-5 seconds to load. In my 50 hours of play time so far, the game has crashed about 5 times. 

There's a lot of stuff... and sometimes a lot of stuff going on with all that stuff. All this stuff can lead to the game bogging down depending on the amount of said stuff. Now it doesn't sound like a word anymore... [b] Stuff... [/b] Weird. [i] Aaaanyway... [/i]

Just make sure to save your game often or if you've built something immaculate, be sure to save it with 'right alt + O' and you'll be fine. Worse case scenario you can start a creative game, build whatever you want, save it with alt + O , reload your game and build it in the F2 menu.

With all that being said, the game is so fun and amusing to me that the graphics aren't even noticeable. The rare occurrence of a crash might induce a rage quit, but is always forgiven. It's too fun to stay away from! I truly enjoy this game, and the fact that you can play p2p co-op and share the experiences make it twice as fun.

TL;DR
+unlimited amount of exploring to be had
+many various friendly and hostile NPC factions, with their own style of bases and ships
+crafting, building, trading, killing, space everything
+play online PvPvE via server list or p2p co-op
-crashes are rare but if you don't save regularly, will make you rage

What is this CPU restriction you have now? Why have you gone and changed flight characteristics so drastically that literally every user submission on the workshop is 100% utterly useless? Why have you restricted building so much that it's pointless to even try? Some of my favorite builds were those massive and imposing CV's that you can make an entrance with and would make other players bases look tiny by comparison. Now, I might as well not even build one and even then to get an SV to warp velocity with cargo or even a small HV docked to it is a challenge not even worth the time.

However, there have been some improvements made, and after giving the game another score of hours. I feel I may have been a bit too critical. -despite the issues with the game, I do keep coming back to play it... because at its root, it is pretty fun. 

Some cautions - be VERY careful about your ship orientation. Backwards/upside-down ships can be fixed, apparently using the cut/paste commands in creative, but the interface is a bit clunky, and doing so is painful, but its better than losing hours of your work.

I haven't run into the issue of objects becoming invulnerable and impossible to delete on my more recent play-through so I cannot list that as an issue. Additionally the last update fixed the mission issues I was running into. 

I will recommend the game at this point, but will add a caution that its still does have its quirks. But frankly, its still a fun game, and despite the fact that it may occasionally annoy you to the point where you take a break, it does draw you back in.

However, I have changed my mind and recommend this game. Let me share something that encapsulates the Empyrion experience.

I was just getting my first base fleshed out. I had three hover vehicles; one for mining, one for wood harvesting, and one for scouting. Trying to explore the planets in Empyrion on a ground vehicle is pretty awful, so I really needed to create an airborne vehicle, the small vessel.

My designs are shit. They are all about function so they look terrible, and honestly they don't even do that well either. This vehicle was pretty barebones. I only wanted enough for a couple guns and minimal cargo space. I only wanted to scout the planet after all. I put together everything I needed, but almost forgot that I needed an RCS for turning so I queued it up. My tiny brain thought ""hey while we wait for that, let's see how this baby handles.""

Well, it turns out it doesn't handle very well if it can't turn. I took off flying fast, and by the time I realized I couldn't turn, I was kilometres away from my base. Without an RCS turning was sooooooo slow. I was trying my hardest to turn around to get back to my base, but it was hard to line back up. In fact, just turning 90 degrees had me halfway across the planet. So I decided to fly all the way around the planet instead...past the poles.

I don't know what happened or why, but as I pulled into the north pull my aircraft lost velocity, hit the ground and flipped over. I climbed out of my vehicle after many failed attempts to thrust myself upright, and my character started sliding across the ground breakneck speed away from my aircraft upside down. It turns out that the game doesn't handle being upside down in gravity very gracefully. Normally, your character slooooowly spins around until they are upright, but for some reason being jammed into the ground after ejection had this side effect.

I did this a couple times trying different things. I did eventually get my aircraft back upright, lined up with my base and flew home. It felt so good once I got back to base. I have never forgotten to put turning capabilities in a vehicle since.

The point is Empyrion is a janky game, but one that proves itself interesting in many different ways. It's mechanics are imperfect, it has bugs, and it doesn't look great. It needs a TON of polish (in every department) and bugfixes, and I feel like someone could play this game and learn a lot about what not to do when making a video game. Still, I managed to look past that after about 20 hours of gameplay. The game opens up and ends up being fairly rewarding. Just know that the negative reviews of this game are not exaggerating.

Old Review:

Holy moly I should have listened to some of the other reviews. The movement, riding, and gun play are all awful so far. It honestly sort of feels and looks like I'm playing a game from about twenty years ago. The quality of the models reminds me of Giants: Citizen Kabuto from the PS2.

Also, bugs. Not talking about spiders here (although there are tons of those as well), but there are some really glaring bugs that shouldn't be in any finished game. Random holes in the ground which have you fall and then appear 20 feet above the ground and break your ankle. Items disappearing after taking them from your corpse. 

I am sure there is a good game hidden down in here somewhere, and I will probably try to play it again once I am less frustrated. If some of the concepts sound cool, please look up some videos first to see what you are getting into, then maybe if you think you can get through that make a purchase.",1642015841,1643983254,True,0,0,0.503116130828857422,0,True,False,False

It looks like they have reverted a lot of the bad missteps from earlier updates, so I'll revert my review.

********

I have over 800+ hours in Empyrion and feel overall it is a good experience, even in early Alpha.  Planet and space generation is interesting, challenging, and fun.  However, honestly Empyrion is not for everyone.  There are a few things that it does well:

1) Lego-like building.  Being able to build and design small hover vessels to large death star sized battle stations is a major plus.  It does have some pretty solid systems in place to keep things balanced (CPU, Mass/Volume) but you don't have very many limits to design choices.  Compared to the handcuff design of No Man's Sky, Empyrion is light years ahead.

2) Actual Multiplayer - Empyrion supports private and public servers with true multiplayer survival.  PvP, Co-op, PvE it's all supported and server admins can tweak settings to their heart's content.

3) Community creations - Take a look through the Empyrion Workshop and you will see hundreds of community made creations from giant flies to great battle carriers.  Bases of all sizes, ships of all sizes, custom scenarios, quests, etc.  The possibilities for the community to build and grow just get better with every update since Eleon actively supports the community.

4) Good Flight Mechanics - Of the space games I've played (NMS, Elite & Dangerous) Empyrion has the most stable and easy to play flight mechanics system.  Since you can also change every block in a ship, how well something flies is really up to you.

There are of course things they don't do well.

1) Content - Right out of the box, there isn't much to do other than forage resources to build the next ship.  There are scenarios with quest chains, but to be honest they are not up to par with what most games are in 2020.  Frankly the quests are pretty rudimentary and not well written.  The framework is there, just a poor implementation.  Content in the game leans pretty heavily on the community to make custom scenarios and quests.

2) Overall quality - enemy and player models, animations, and some other environmental aspects of the game feel very amateurish.  There are many that you can tell are right out of the Unity asset store.  The player model feels like it's on roller skates a lot of the time and you end up having to use your jetpack only to slide off of flat surfaces or steep ramps.

3) Alpha is suddenly ready for prime time - The game is released as 1.0 but it is not finished...not by a long shot.  A lot of people are going to buy this and want a refund because they did not know what state the game is in.  If you were to put NMS and Empyrion side by side, you would conclude that NMS was made by a professional company and Empyrion was not.  There are many places where it feels more like a fan made project than an actual game.

Overall, Empyrion is very fun if you like building creatively and survival mechanics.  It has a very helpful and friendly community with active YouTubers covering all aspects of gameplay.  The company (Eleon) genuinely cares about the game and the community and listens to feedback.  These are all really good things that should be encouraged by your purchase of the game.  I think it’s well worth its price tag.",1596661809,1643927111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have watched the Devs continuously and consistently update and add features to this game.. It has come a long way over the years and I keep coming back to it over and over. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone now days. Sure there are still some things that could be tuned and even added or reworked, but the Devs of this game listen to the community and really do care about the community input, which is really refreshing since so many other game devs do not at all.

It is fun playing solo at times (specially when creating stuff) and multi-player both.

So if you usually like this type of game and are on the fence on buying it, I would suggest yes... do buy it. It's absolutely worth it. And if your someone who played it years ago and didn't think it was worth playing at the time because of what ever state it was in at the time, be it lacking in stuff or glitches, I would recommend coming back and trying it again :)

if you put your settings on hard you will have a very hard time defending your base for one reason, if you follow the tutorial they want you to make your base above ground and use an old broken radar thing (its not big) and as soon as I did that I was doing fine, progressing and everything but I started to build walls and I got a zirax attack. The desided to send drones, 2 rocket drones and a machine gun drone. the rocket drones are safe aslong as your constantly moving and away from your base but if a machine gun drone lines up right it can take away half your health in 3 seconds. This may not seem like a problem but I could not defend myself at all and I crafted a regular automatic rifle. I died over and over just trying to shoot down a single drone. Long story short I could not destroy a single one, and my base was left to rot because I could not kill the drones. This game is still really good though but beginners NEED to adjust the settings for an easier and enjoyable play through and you would be amazed by how giant the universe is and how fun it can be and if survival is not for you they have a really good creative mode where you can build whatever you want without the hassle of grinding.

Early game I was worrying about survival (Staying Warm, Finding Food, Gathering Resources).
Mid game I had a base, vehicles & was exploring the planet.
Late game I was going on missions in deep space in my capital vessel.

Pros:
-Missions (11 Story + Faction missions). To get you out exploring & doing.
-Just a MASSIVE universe. So many places to go its almost over whelming.
-Massive build options! Bases, Vehicles, Vessels, Capital ships!
-blueprints (I'm not creative. It's more fun to fly a cool looking ship vs my flying brick).
-Being able to tear down, take over, or use just about everything you come across.

Cons:
-Once I ran out of missions & things to do (after 250+ hours). For me, that was the main driver to keep things moving forward, exploring, and doing things. Without it & sitting on top of all the resources I could possibly use, I didn't feel inclined to visit a new system to gather more resources. I built up my base to make it really cool, but that didn't advance me or really benefit me in anyway.
-I only played single player, so I felt very alone. I have this massive capital ship for 1.
-(very minor) It would be nice if it was easier to use the repair station to repair your ship. It'd be great if you could link your repair station to a container vs. having to load in items manually.

My Next Steps to get more:
-I might try multiplayer or look into some mods to get more (reforged eden?).

It has a lot of really great things in the game, like the ship building/destruction, bases getting attacked every so often, huge random gen world with a ton of PoIs to discover and infinite replayability.

But instead of making the game look good, optimising the game and fixing all the issues that just plague the game, all the really do is add more stuff to a badly optimised game.

I come back to the game every so often to see if theres been any meaningful changes. but all thats changed since i bought the game over a year ago was add water ripples, new foilage and kind of?...make the AI better, its better at tracking but overall still very poor.

The game *does* have a story but not a 'story mode', Press F1 and look for the missions. Some of these automatically start if you opted to play the Tutorial missions (they link together with the first story missions, at least when I did them -updates might've altered that) But each Faction I've found so far has its own mission tree that unlocks when you find them. The main Story missions though will take you all over the place to different worlds and locations. A few NPCs I've found actually give you missions face to face - but for the most part, you get them via the F1 menu - which I like because it allows you to ignore the story all together if you don't want to do it.

Building feels a little better to me than Space Engineers, mainly for options in design: block shapes, painting and decals, having clear visuals on blocks of what axis you are going to rotate on instead of elsewhere on the screen, having the ability to quickly build rows of blocks at once by click-dragging makes sealing up ships faster, along with ""Oops"" block placements being easily undone with the Multi-tool without having to re-craft the block (when set to Retrieve mode!) - so even glaring mistakes are quickly and easily fixed.

If the camera motion gets makes players feel sick, I believe there is an option to turn it off, though from what I can tell the camera shake is no worse then any other game.

Combat feels dangerous, even on Easy settings. Hostile NPCs know how to aim and will put you down hard if you take to long to deal with them! All hand weapons have recoil and are scaled - It'll take ages to destroy a single Capital vessel block with an assault rifle (if it even lets you damage it) which also applies to NPCs shooting your ships. Small vessels can take a surprising amount of punishment before you need to stop and fix any critical parts - assuming you didn't put critical systems on the outside of the Hull, and NPCs ships (not Drones) are reasonably tough to beat, but not impossible particularly in space when you turn off your ships ""Auto brake"" so Space acts like Space and you float until you change your direction (Default Key: i ) and lean to ""skid"" to avoid shots.

On the note of combat, this game does have PvP, though it might depend on the settings of the server you join (The game has a single player/Coop option as well), and I have had some pretty interesting battles, particularly between me and other players Capital Vessels exchanging everything from Laser fire to Artillery rounds and Missiles - Small Vessel Dogfights are a pretty fun challenge and Hover Vessels are very fun for base sieges, and for the most part, there is always an exchange in combat - If you win or lose, one of you will have some extensive repairs to make, and I personally love that.

Farming can be a little bit of a learning curve compared to other games, but once you realize you need Crop Plots & Growing lights at a particular height, you can feed yourself fairly easily- even on your Capital Vessel! Though you can normally find enough early game that your Suits processor can keep you fed with energy bars, just be mindful that Sprinting lowers Stamina, and Stamina recharge burns off your food gauge, so you can't just hold down sprint.

Overall the game requires a level of patience, particularly if you are playing solo and some skill. But It is very enjoyable to play and I'm having fun exploring the galaxy.

I have to wonder though, what kinds of potatoes people are trying to play this on that its bugging out so badly for them?",1642949484,1642949484,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the one hand you have a fairly standard Unity sandbox survival game. Nothing really special in the terms of graphics. You eat to survive, you use your survival tool on trees to get wood, stones to get stone etc. and there's the fairly normal ""do stuff to gain xp and gain recipes"" aspect to it as well. 
Well that's where the other sides of the game come in. The ship building in this game is just incredible. You build a ship like you build a house, you just make a frame out of blocks and you put in the stuff it needs to go: Cockpit, thrusters, guns, some kind of generator and a fuel tank and whether it's a beautifully sculpted space shuttle or a square potato made of metal, it'll hover or fly and you'll feel like a damn genius for doing it too. You'll start out barely scraping together a hover vessel and defending your base from occasional attacks, and 100 hours later you'll find yourself in space building a Ship yard to crank out your first Capitol Vessel while going on mining runs on the various planets in the nearby solar system and raiding Zirax bases for rare materials and gear, while that base you were defending before is now protected by automated guns and almost completely self sufficient in terms of power.
The game is definitively rough around the edges sometimes, and there's definitively more than a few bugs or glitches, but there's so much to discover and build it barely matters.

People keep comparing this game to space engineers, saying that it does everything except building ships better, which is true for the sole reason Space Engineers doesn't HAVE anything besides ship building.
Everything in this game is buggy as fucking shit, movement feels clunky as hell, your mouse moves when you run, NPC's practically EXIST in the A pose, ctrl button cannot be bound to anything, which has been a bug for OVER 5 FUCKING YEARS apparently, the dungeons are terrible, the combat is bad as well, the missions suck, literally nothing has ANY redeeming qualities, the only thing this game HAS is that it's got more depth then Space Engineers, which as I said earlier, is just a ship building game and beyond that has the depth of  spilled soda

They took the absolute bare basics of ARK, and the absolute bare basics of Space Engineers, and made this game, and honest to god I just can't get into it. Maybe I'm playing it wrong or something, but honestly, if the basic movement is enough to make me motion sick, there needs to be something done.
I want to like it, but I just can't.

If Space Engineers combined it's engine and more refined system with this games NPC's and more alive world, you'd have a fantastic game, but both games suck because they're both missing something the other has. Space Engineers lacks a living world, and this game, basic refinement

so essentially it's like space engineers with some key differences:
first off there's gameplay. like, AI ships and factions and a functioning hunger and stamina system, rather than the literally nothing that's in space engineers
second, I haven't heard ENERGY LOW ENERGY CRITICAL four hundred thousand times yet
third, the engine actually runs instead of needing to gate things behind """"""experimental mode"""""" and severe block limits
oh yeah and fourth and not the most important or anything, there's not a metric ton of DLC that's """"just cosmetic""""

there are a bunch more than that but I mean it's a space crafting survival whatever game you know what you're getting into. there are some AI POI balance issues but considering patches are relatively constant that'll probably get worked out. bugs are here and there but your ship doesn't sponatneously explode because the physics engine blows like it does in space engineers. you're prolly gonna rely on cheese to clear POIs and I won't blame you but obviously that's not a great look when the game pretty strongly incentivizes you to do that but I mean whatever boss it's still better than space engineers.

     The POIs are well thought out and I feel they spent some time making them unique.
     Multiple factions you have to deal with so there is a good amount of missions.

Cons- the battle audio is horrible. It is hard to tell where you are getting shot from as the combat audio is almost non existent. I did a lot because I am unsure where I am getting killed from so have a difficult time finding cover quickly.
     I found it difficult to construct aesthetic vehicles/bases in a short time. There are so many blocks and shapes you can use. Using a 2d thumbnail for a 3d shape makes it difficult.
     The enemy AI is also pretty bad. They do not take cover when shot and just stand there and accept getting shot with a sniper.

Overall I am enjoying the game and the pros outweigh the cons and make this game fun.

The answer I will give is, No. Not by a long shot.

What I will say however, is that this is the perfect game for me.

Yes it's fun to play the game, crashing on a planet, gathering supplies to survive, and fighting the Zirax or whatever faction you choose to pit yourself against...

But that's just the beginning.

Empyrion opens up when you learn how to use the creator, and build our own bases and ships. Exploring the galaxy or taking down a Dreadnought in something you've built yourself is an incredible feeling. Finding creative ways to take down bases using things you've built, just feels good.

Think Minecraft meets literally any space simulator. Add seemless transitions from planet to space, ground and space combat, resource gathering, health/oxygen/food survival metrics, and what you've got is a game that can keep you invested for years.

Check out spanj or jeffrandall on YouTube to see some solid building skills at work.
But don't let them intimidate you, even simple builds can be amazing!

Now... as I said, it's not perfect. While it's technically only been ""released"" for a year, it's been in an Alpha since... 2016? ish?
There are still many bugs, and grievances from the player base that have yet to be addressed by the development team.
Many bugs have been addressed multiple times such as the ""lag shot"" and still it exists.

I've had it for a long time and would occasionally dip in and give it a try.  I started it three times only to quit within an hour or two thinkin, 'nope, still a buggy voxel cash grab'.  I finally pushed through the bugs and the learning curve and I found there is a lot to love with this one.  On the surface, it's your basic voxel survival game with the usual crafting and resource tiers.  There is a lot of depth in the vehicle construction, which is where the game shines and there aren't many out there that come close in that respect.  Similar games would be Scrap Mechanic, Avorion, Space Engineers, and heavily modded Minecraft.  The modding scene looks promising and the Reforged Eden overhaul remakes the game with more depth and fixes the Engrish of the game's story.  I'm about 50 hours in at the time of this writing and I think this one be one of the pillars I come back to every so often to try out different mods and online experiences, netting a few hundred hours overall.  That definitely makes it a bargain buy.  I hope to see more awesome stuff on the modding side.  If the devs support the modding side, this could be one of the greats.

UPDATE:  Passed that predicted few hundred hours mark... wow!  The game's story is sparse and not complete... both the vanilla game and the Reforged Eden overhaul.  Most of my time is in Reforged Eden.  There is just enough story to lead you out into a vast galaxy.  I'm still finding new points of interest and there are still challenges I'm not even close to overcoming (lookin at you Tovera Deadnaught).  I've gone from scrapping for food and medicine to survive on the surface of a starter planet to building a giant space station where I keep several purpose built vessels along with many that I've captured and repaired to keep as trophies.

Update,

Decided to give this game another go. I cant do it. I hunted for 2 hours looking for promethuem and found nothing. Most time is spent looking for food. Devs made the planet too big. It's just driving around from area to area looking for enough food to keep you going. It's survival but it is so boring now. I am done with this game unless the devs make it less boring. I had such high hopes for this game and enjoyed many hours playing it. Not any more.

Another update,

This game continues to disappoint. Still many game breaking bugs. I really want to enjoy this game but i end up rage quitting and uninstalling. Its too bad. I wish this game was like version 5 in pre alpha. That was the best build. You would think that after all these years, the developers would have fixed all the bugs. I still do not recommend this game.",1454449434,1641706370,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's so bad that I spent two hours attempting to figure out how to properly load and fire weapons on a vehicle
only to find that developers updated and changed keys, menus and protocols around since answers were provided on reddit (Empyrions' Community and Guide could really only a offer what a vessel turret looks like and its stats).

There have been no updates to any manual or wiki as to the most recent way to fire a gun from your vehicle.

So finally after pawing my way around the game's board I discover that weapons are meant to fire automatically (once configured properly) and that there are no manually operated item in any vehicle, ground or space-fairing, outside of drills.

This, as you can understand, is one very small facet which is repeated with nearly every feature in the game.

I could only recommend this if you''re bound to a wheelchair for life and this is the only game you plan on owning.

Some of the things I find annoying about the game.
- Manipulating voxels for any purpose other than mining will drive you insane.

- deciding to wing it and building something from scratch in a survival game always puts you at a disadvantage and possibly wastes resources because of random enemy assaults on incomplete creations.

-there is a bit of a imbalance between food spoiling, hunger depletion, and power for a fridge. Food spoils before your hungry, it requires a quite bit of food to fill your hunger bar, and fridges, which stop spoiling, require power which on anything not solar powered means your wasting energy. A lot of players survive on energy bars you craft in your inventory as they get low to avoid fridges when there is a whole mess of food to pick from.",1641372665,1641372665,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a handful of hours of fun, exploration, and combat. The base game itself is pretty big but once you master it there isn't much to do. That's when you switch over to a custom scenario like reforged eden which somewhat extends the enjoyment you'll get out of the game. The game's survival aspect with progression shines early to mid game. Once you have a good amount of ore and some decent ships, suddenly you don't really have anything left to work towards. At that point it comes down to if you like to build custom things or role play. 

Yes you will encounter bugs and sometimes they are severe enough to make you lose your progress. A teleporter that bugs out and spawns you in space, you may have to completely restart if you can't recover from that. Getting stuck in an area you can't get out of, it may happen. 

Worst part about the game by far is the combat, it's extremely unpolished. Maybe not by itself but combat + horrible audio really ruins it. There's often no indicator that you've been shot, you'll just drop dead or see your health bar go down. There's no fancy bullet physics, it's point and shoot. Unfortunately that means enemies do not miss. There's no such thing as trying to dodge ground troops or turrets, they will hit you 99% of the time. This leads to a lot of undeserved/cheesy deaths. The graphics for shooting are also scuffed. You'll get hit by bullets/rockets you never see fired. I never take on POIs directly, I burrow beneath them and explode my way in from the floor because taking on the turrets is far too frustrating unless you have a ship that can tank it. 

There is a good sense of progression. You make basic things to make beginner things to make intermediate things to make advanced things. If you're on a custom scenario then you'll make advanced things to make super advanced things and so on. It's enjoyable to go from hand mining ore deposits in the ground to setting up auto miners that give you basically infinite ore. 

There are endgame activities but they are few and specific. Not much to do with progress, it's mostly something you seek out for a challenge. Game is extremely far from finished. It's out of alpha now technically but it's still pretty much an alpha stage product.It's something you play through once or twice, put it down, then come back in a few years.",1641061988,1641353425,True,0,0,0.496453911066055298,0,True,False,False

Walking around without armor, learning to survive on a hostile (or semi-hostile) planet surface, only to discover how to gather resources and ultimately build a space ship...and then being able to go beyond that, to capital sized vessels?

The ship designs need some work: Some large size vessels are amazingly nimble (but they do require commensurately more fuel).

The AI needs some work: it's a bit predictable and the animations are a bit janky. The developers have added a tutorial and mission series that introduces the player to the bad guys.

However instead I will tell you about how the devs behind this game has constantly updated and improved the game for better and for worse over the years unlike a lot of Steam Early Access games. Even though I don't play it as often anymore I still have thoughts about this game and memories of all the time I spent with it. So to the Devs of this game and to the potential players looking whether or not they should buy it I'd say, HELL YEAH I'M SCARED OF SPIDERS. 

But for real this game was a blast. I hope the devs keep going strong.",1640918844,1640918844,True,5,0,0.513601064682006836,0,True,False,False

While the tutorial does a decent job of walking you through the mechanics and not hanging you out to dry there is no shame in taming it down while you learn.  The Ai while still dumbed down on certain things has evolved and become better at attacking which can be challenging for  a noob still learning where things are and what buttons to push.

Tip: Do not be afraid to die.  Others have said it.  Do not be afraid to click that difficulty button when starting the game and select keep everything on death.  While it may be beneficial to turn off drone attacks while you get started and get the basics of base building that will feel very vanilla after awhile and yes you have the option to turn it back on.

Take advantage of the streamers who have done excellent play throughs like Kage848.  Tackle the basics and learn to survive and die to survive again.  

The best tip i can give is as i have said multiple ways above...   Dont hang the white flag.. If you are stuck and cant find that resource or how to build something search it out.  Look in the forums, watch videos, and ask.  Its all there but sometimes you may have to search to find that part you are trying to craft.. (maybe you dont have the right constructor or the right amount of resources)  Based on my experiences so far i would not be surprised to look back and see this another game I have logged 3-4k hours on 

There is a story line.  There is no voice acting but there is a story line and i have found it enjoyable so far.  If you like fighting there is plenty of that.  If you like Base building or being creative there is plenty of that.  If you like exploring.... Holy ....!!!

Any game that allows me to build my own starships and especially space stations is far too tempting of a prospect for me to say no to. 

Empyrion is certainly not perfect by any stretch, and I will say that the issues with it mean that it won't be for everyone. But I myself have definitely had fun with the game, and I greatly enjoy it despite its flaws. If you like space sandboxes and don't mind a game that's a little more buggy, then give this game a try if it looks interesting to you at all.

But I do want to say to the devs: [i]Please[/i] put some more focus into bugfixing. Seriously. In the game's current state, especially after how long it has been around, doing some serious debugging and fixing is one of the best things you can do for the game right now.

Empyrion is basically like 7 days to die met minecraft, that then had a baby with space marines.

If you can imagine it, you can build it here. Hovercrafts, small vessels ( first flight ) to capital vessels ( star trek style ships ) which are entirely different beasts. You can spend dozens upon dozens of hours designing a ship or base, and you will certainly spend dozens of hours exploring space. I mean that, there are THOUSANDS of planets to discover, every single one unique in its own way. Sometimes youll find your way to a planet no one ( players ) has discovered yet. That's how many planets there are in a single universe, so many that its seemingly, truly, impossible to ever explore them all a lone. The further you jump into space the better prepared you need to be. You don't want to get stranded on a planet and not have the means to get off of it, because not every planet has the raw materials you need and not every solar system will either which will require you to explore other systems. Some planets have high gravity and non-breathable air, making them very difficult to get off of and explore. There is a good variety of enemies and creatures, though there is only, generally speaking, one * bad* faction, the Zirax, who everyone hates. Some solar systems are hostile, some are controlled by friendlies, some are in a current state of war, while other remain completely untouched. The amount of time you can spend delving into an enemy base on the surface of a planet ( or a space station)  to discover all its treasure is wild, there is so much loot to be found and had and there is a wide array of items to discover. The list just keeps on keeping on, there is always something to find out there in space. Better hope its not an enemy dreadnought or you might find yourself being turned to space dust..

I started this game because a streamer I like played it among others (I blame you Stephen Silverbeard ;) ). 
It was at the end of the alpha-phase and quickly the game got released - just for time-stamp since I own this game (May 2020). 

I liked the idea of building your own stuff with blocks and honestly I never played a building game before (I was more or less a RTG or FPS player at the beginning of the century and than suddenly stopped playing). But what I found here is just mindblowing and I'm no fanboy and I am hard to inspire/satisfy ;) 

Plus:
1) The game itself
I mean, we are talking about a combination of space game, FPS and roleplay game. Jesus! And it looks ok (Unity) and almost has an infinite universe to explore (yes, space + planets are all visitable = almost infinte!). I'm always stunned by the size and details...

2) Building
The abilities you have building is endless I would say. Tough to learn at the beginning but after a short dip into it (thanks JRandall, Xcaliber and Spanj) nothing seems impossible. You can build different kind of structures with not too complex mechanics to it and use them in game. 
What a pleasure to use your thought out ship and kick enemies ass (when the ship works out well) :)  And there are a lot of fine communities around which help too.

3) Communities
As before: Nobody needs to be alone with ideas, questions or help requests. Amazing how people from everywhere  are helping each other. I never felt more home than here.
There are some cool multiplayer servers too with Discord-voice and you can join forces as well (how amazing is a combined attack in space with different ships!)

4) Developers
Eleon is constantly (!) patching the game and putting in more content or features. The community is often regarded how to develope the game and hotfixes for bugs or exploits are often.

5) Mods
There are some amazing mods out there which even enhance the story or features. These are giving the game more depth if the standard game is not enough. Speaking of Project Eden, Reforged Galaxy, Reforged Eden (combination of the former named) and Star-Salvage. 

Minus:
Where there is light, there is shadow too ...

1) Bugs
They are in the game - nobody can say they are not! Sometimes they even come with patches which is weird. It is hard to describe and sometimes annoying. Some even come with patches too which is crazy. Sad, but I have to say as well: No bug is a showstopper! just a pitty ;) 

2) Building
Building, again. Why? Simply spoken: If you get into building and realizing what is possible you soon find out the borders. And unfortunately these borders are obvious and not fixed yet. Speaking of:
- more blocks shapes (there is a forum-post with nearly any block shape imaginable, even with 3D models of the blocks) which are not in cause there is an ID-limitation for blocks :(
- texturing is a pain on some blocks since you are limited to a certain amount of sides you can texture on a block... this makes me almost rant all the time
- why can't we have all blocks/devices on every sort of vessel (some blocks are limited to certain vessel-types)
It could be so awesome not having the limitations ... just dreaming :)

3) Features
Somehow the feature catalogue with builds and POIs is outdated (feels like 10 years, sorry):
- almost no automation (processing materials in the game / production)
- enemy AI (no details on this, Reforged is a well known Mod)
- space magic vs. realism (I use this term for a lot of not logical features/behaviours in the game e.g. like the invisible endless ressource sink called factory to bring in large builds in game from your pocket)

All in all, my summery is: BUY this game, if
- you don't expect a Unreal 5 Engine looking game (Unity is limited, but this game looks pretty cool, especially in space)
- you are willing to learn a game mechanic (learning curve is steep but satisfying as well)
- you are creative and like building + survival (I have no comparison but this game let you build all crazy stuff relatively easily + survival mechanics)
- you are not bothered by minor bugs (which hopefully get fixed someday)

If you get annoyed of simple problems are more or less interested in a single player game with story you probably will not love the game. I concentrates on different aspects... 

conclusion:
I would rate a deserved 7 of 10 for it but defenitely recommend the purchase! (I mean 4k hours in 1 game are intense :) )

Will be making this review as more of a review of how the game has progressed than what I think of it in it's current state. Ill be reviewing a lot of features as they have changed and my opinion of their changes as a whole.

First, for context, I've been playing on and off since Early Access at just shy of 1500 hours and still remember the early buggy mess that has gone by the wayside. The game has grown leaps and bounds over the years and I can't wait to see it fully finished.

With the recent update, obviously, I love the new progress with Water mechanics. It looks a hell of a lot better, even if it doesnt flow like real water yet.

The textures have improved greatly over the years, and they continue to get better.

The CPU system is interesting, but could use more work. I actually prefer the Reforged Eden system overall. it works better. The devs should consider making this an alternate official version of the game so people have more options for CPU, but insert their own storyline more easily.

I understood WHY they simplified the food system, but I kinda miss having different fruits and crops you had to grow. it increased the immersion and difficulty to the game, forcing players to plan out meals, and plan out trade options with other players(or NPCS for when that finally got implemented) I'd like to see them bring the old crops back, but I understand why they probably won't.

Maybe I'll revisit in a year or two and see what they have fixed by then, but since its already been years and years to get to this point it looks doubtful if will ever reach maturity.

I thought this game was still early access, but apparently not.  I disabled the explosive blocks in the comm station where I had started my base(which is what the quests direct you to) after playing about 3 hours and rocket drones showed up immediately and wiped everything out.  I didn't know this game was a screw you in the face and we don't care kind of game.  I don't mind a challenge, but these things one shot you repeatedly. I got one shotted by the drones about a dozen times before my stuff despawned so I couldn't get my gear back.  Why you have quests guiding someone through building a base then completely wipe it out without any warning?  I also don't understand why everything has such an aggressive despawn in a single player game.  It's designed to screw you.  You grab your gear but nothing is remembered in your hotbar, so you have to open inventory to equip, but that's enough time for a rocket to smack you when since you can't dodge it.  Such an aggresive despawn would make sense in MP, but in SP it's just stupid.  If you can't deal with a few extra containers hanging out for 30 minutes then you got something more serious wrong with your game engine.  Game play should define the challenge of a game.  Just creating impossible scenarios, artificial despawns, and terrible UI isn't what makes a game challenging.

Heaters flaky.  If you're right up against them but standing on ground that's ever so slightly lower than how the game placed the heater, you don't get heated.

Then when your cold, starving, and stamina drained, the curved staircases can't be climbed.  The game doesn't treat stairs as some special walkable structure. The curved staircase is just a very steeply angled ramp that you can't climb when stamina is low.  So you can't get to your fridge within your own base until you die because you didn't know stairs are garbage.

The fact you can't pick up blocks combined with how easy it is to either misplace them, or learn something surprising after placing them is very unforgiving.  If you want to move your base there's no ""moving"" it.  Many of the resources you invested are lost.  Things like generators fueled by bip fuel inexplicably produce radation, so surprise, you just made it and placed in your base?  Destroy it now that you learned the hard way and go collect those resources again.

Warning: Saves don't work anything like any other game.  When you explicitly save a game, and then go back and load that game, it will be begin automatically overwriting that game.  Where as most games auto save to a different rotation of auto saves.  So I rebuilt my base again, and drones showed up, so I did a save and it says ""backed up"".  Backed up! HAH!  Base gets toasted, so I load that back up from before the save.  Guess what? It starts automatically overwriting that backup.  So now I try to go back and load it again, the backup basically doesn't exist, when I exited to get back to the menu where I can load, it has already been overwritten.  Screwed again!

Imo, this game is more complex than Rimworld, X3, Kenshi, or Elite Dangerous. After unsuccessfully trying to get into this game years ago, recently, I was lucky to have an experienced friend (very patiently) explain it's core mechanics. The tutorial is often criticized as ""too long"" or ""inadequate"" because most players have probably never encountered an experience this deep. Unfortunately for new players, the tutorial, resources online and on YouTube are often inadequate when explaining everything this game is capable of doing. I've seen popular reviews of this game on Youtube where the reviewer clearly didn't scratch the surface.

I thought the ship building aspect of this game would be tedious and no fun for me. I was wrong. Reforged Eden's weight, velocity, power, and CPU balance means that design is truly meaningful. You can create a ship that prioritizes function or aesthetics but it's really exciting when you can do both and perfectly match your vessel to your playstyle and personality. I have never encountered a progression loop that was more rewarding than continuously re-engineering my ship as my needs, skills, and equipment evolved. You can refit ships in the field to accomplish different tasks. This is the first game in a long time where I went to sleep thinking about the adventures, strategies, and loadouts I was excited to try the next day. 

Pros:
- Brilliant inventory management 
- Amazing customization
- Limitless expansion potential with inclusion of player created POI's, factions, ships, items, planets, etc. 
- Wonderful sense of exploration 
- Can be quiet beautiful
- Lots of randomness 
- So much better than games like X4 at teaching the player.
- True sandbox 
- Incredible depth
- Flight controls are much more intuitive than the first person combat

Cons:
- Frustrating save system
- Combat is really janky. Clunk shouldn't be the determiner of difficulty. Preparation, strategy, and speed should be. 
- Merging the random cave creation and first person smoothness of Deep Rock Galactic (another voxel game) with Empyrion's incredible depth and scope would be incredible. 
- Those dinosaurs that look like they are spinning on circus poles. I told my buddy I was experiencing a server error ... he was like ... ""Nope ... that's what they look like."" ...  WTF?
- There needs to be more unique NPC's with different skills, products, missions, etc. Right now there are ""NPC types"" that spawn in specific places with a set list of products. It gets redundant. There needs to be a slim chance that some/each of those NPC's sell/buy one or two rare items.This would incentivize landing on multiple instances of the same POI.
- Primitive dynamic quest system at this stage of development (this game doesn't really need a story ... it just needs more dynamic quests "" like Stalker Anomaly"" with meaningful rewards.) Trade, mine, fight, 
- Money feels a bit meaningless when everything is craftable and lootable. There should sets of armors, weapons, engines, upgrades, ammo or opportunities than only money can buy ... or can only be obtained through the barter of precious ores. This would extend the endgame. Specialize engineers/quest givers scattered across the galaxy ""like Elite Dangerous"" would be very cool. The opportunity to pay huge sums of credits for marginal upgrades to my engines, weapons, generators, shields, etc. 
- The movement is too slippery. Like your character has vasoline on his shoes. I'm always falling off of things. 
- Some of the mission design is simply absurd, outdated, and trollish. I feel like I'm playing Nintendo 64 Goldeneye on Maximum difficulty. High difficulty is cool but survival should always be an option ... on some of these missions and POI's ... survival is virtually impossible. I've taken screenshots of enemies literally pouring out of the ceiling, teleport spawning all around me, turrets in cheesy corners, turrets not being there and then spawning in. A bunch of goofy stuff that the creators clearly thought was clever but isn't realistic or fun. Sadistic dungeon crawls where no weapon's DPS, player speed, or strategy would give any hope of survival. 
- Factions need further fleshed out. 
- More opportunities to make faction friends (super easy to make enemies)
- Cored enemy ships shouldn't disappear so quickly. Let me loot. 
- The door codes are a mess. 

Overall ... this game went from collecting dust in my library to one of the most promising projects I've had the joy of experiencing. I really hope the developers either continue to improve this title ... or migrate it (a sequel?) to an engine that can address some of it's limitations. Huge thanks to the Empyrion and Reforged Eden teams. Amazing work!",1634545668,1639115250,True,1,0,0.503830075263977051,0,True,False,False

Pros :
Frequent Updates from Devs
Relatively Deep RPG-Esque quest system 
Factions/Storylines
Varied Planets Flora/Fauna
Easy to Learn, Moderate to Master
Plenty of gamechanging mods (Reforged Eden is highly recommended)

Cons
Debatably dated graphics
AI isn't great on ground without help of mods (R.E works for this) 
Can be difficult to navigate early on if grind isn't your thing
Gunplay is a little bit stiff

Overall, though. I can't speak on this too much having still around 27 hours at time of writing, but i do highly, highly enjoy this game.

This game has a number of things in common with other well known games of this genre.
However, it does a number of things far better and more polished than those other games too.

The fact that there are NPC races and factions as well as story lines and missions/quests is wonderful. The game runs better in multiplayer than those other games too.

They game is still being polished and worked on by the Dev team and with out DLC costs!

The Dev team has a lot they still want to accomplish and they continue to keep things moving forwards.

This game has such huge potential!

I have been with this game far longer than my purchase date.

If you are on the fence about buying and you love space, building/exploration type games,
pull the trigger and give it a shot!

I've been playing this game off and on, for over 4 years.

4 years ago, this game was brilliant. Sure, it was early access, had bugs, but there was a ton of promise and it was a lot of fun.

But then the changes started. Weapons got significantly nerfed to where they were doing fractions of their previous damage (Example: The wiki states that the rail gun takes two hits to destroy an enemy turret. In actuality, it takes 19-20 hits). Bugs that were persistent were reported frequently have not been fixed. Such as clipping through the planet. Or your ship. Or accessing food in storage, and it immediately spoils. Passengers getting ejected when entering atmosphere. The massive lag issues when you have a passenger in your ship in the first place. Etc, so forth, and so on.

Skipped a few years, jumped back into it. Rather than improving on the past, they've simply improved on the mistakes.

All the previous bugs? Seem to still be there. Not 20 minutes into a new game, dismantling a ship for the story, game crashed every single time. Had to advance the story in the log, because it was impossible to actually complete.  Lag issues persist. Enemies can shoot through walls. 

Even more things are nerfed. Food, weapons, equipment, etc. The survival meal went from 500 food, to 300. The player sized Plasma Cannon which used to take out whole walls, barely dents a single block. 

Recipes are far more complicated, for seemingly no purpose. Some of the new things seem like the team didn't bother to look at how the previous team named things, so some of the names don't match up. I'll edit this when I find a specific example, but when playing with friends, there were a few times when the game told us to go find something, and it was actually called something else.

The Wiki is all but USELESS, as most of these changes happened a year ago, and no one (Devs or players) has bothered to update the wiki with the new information.  A lot of pages just have filler info. Example: One planet page, for weather simply states ""Something. Something else."" Another page for an ingredient: ""This ingredient is used in many recipes."" - Doesn't bother to mention any specifically. Some pages reference materials or items that haven't been in the game in over 2 years.  All the pages reference your starting planet of Akua. Mine is named Zygon for some reason. None of the planets in my system relate to any of the wiki names, which makes it tedious to figure out what planet might have a specific material.

Specific info: The Wiki manager, PCJ, has only edited TWO wiki pages in the entire last year. That's all. Game went full release, and that is all the Wiki manager has updated. That tells you all you need to know about how much this developer cares about updating things.

Then there's the idiotic mass/volume/CPU system they're trying to implement. Why? This isn't Kerbal. Luckily, you can turn it off, which just leaves you with warning messages all over the place as you exceed limits.

So, what have the devs done in the 3 years? As a few reviews have stated, it seems like they have focused only on adding new material, without any regard or respect to the previous problems. And for some reason, they feel the need to ""fix"" things that aren't broken. Something took 4 ingredients previously? Now it's 11. And takes 4 times as long to make.

Sure, it's still playable. But my desire to sink hundreds of hours into it like I did previously....is gone. 

I highly recommended it when it was in early access. If this is what full release is going to look like: Do not recommend. Maybe give it another 2-3 years for them to finally fix their wiki and all the bugs, and it might be an enjoyable game again.",1638456776,1638887126,False,68,7,0.708782434463500977,0,True,False,False

When I did the tutorial it told me to power up ""the base"" so I walked around a little bit wondering what it meant, turns out it meant smash your face into a wall. Then I walk down a ramp and get stuck for a moment before realising you need to press c to descend through the middle of some scaffolding? Ok now we're in the middle of a crashed ship or something? This is kind of cool, kill a few enemies that posed literally less threat than the dirt they stood on, most of them didn't even turn around. Descend further, loot some boxes, kill some more statues, still being frustrated by the movement like I'm on ice. Get to the end and  shoot at some guy in a small room, he disappears, ok now what. Walk around some more, try clicking everything, pressing everything, nothing. Google says I need to turn the switch on?

There are a number of game modes available, but none of them have any life. You can start in survival mode and go about mining rock and resources to make a base and then a space ship. Only to find another planet and do it all again. 

You can do all this... on your own. 

It doesn't appear to be multiplayer and the only mobs I've ever seen were some things too far away to tell what they were and shot me insta-dead. Only one NPC encounter in months. maybe because I find survival to tedious and solitary and they only appear in survival. Who knows. On creative you have the option of skipping all the building and start in a pre-made colony. In a survival game, you can skip the survival... and then do what? 

I suppose it's like those show houses where you can see what it should look like.

This game is missing many of its immersion factors. Mass multiplayer, NPC's - many more NPC's are needed. 

I know the game is in Early Access, but it as been for a long long time. In this time, games have come and died. Indeed the graphics of this game are already starting to look tired and dated. 

I also understand the dev team is very small. I feel that other games and indeed, technology, is going to outpace the development of this game.

EDIT: Played again in December 2021. While there is a tutorial, the game is fundamentally broken in many ways. Basic story items do not work, e.g., You have to craft an ointment to heal a wound before it kills you. So you trade for the ingredients, craft the item and then apply the ointment. It does nothing.

The developers continue to work on the game.  The modding community continues to add ship designs, quests, and entire scenarios.  It is a good game, and unlike most survival games there is decent PvE content beyond just surviving.  I'm not sure if lag and loading was fixed or my computer has gotten better, either way it is not the issue it was a year ago.  It is well worth the full price

edit: March, 2020 - Performance seems to have degraded, long load times and graphics lag while playing the game have made this less fun to play.  Still rating it a positive, but now would recommend against it if you don't have a mid to upper end gaming computer.

At the time of this post, I have 742 hours of gameplay. Most of that has been spent playing cooperatively with 3 close friends.

We'd start new universes on the hardest difficulty, working together to find materials and scratch out rudimentary base defenses before the drones, Zirax, and various indigenous tribes came and tried to make jewelry out of our organs. We had wild adventures in the wilderness on our hoverbikes, fighting off raptors and spiders and zombie aliens. Digging up ancient ruins. Cleansing horrible biological experiments gone wrong. Exploring strange new worlds. Seeking out new life, new civilizations. Stealing their stuff. Committing war crimes against the Zirax Empire. Don't worry, they totally deserved it.

We built elaborate underground bases. Turned mountains into fortresses. Constructed capital ships that were works of art. Space-based ship construction facilities. Giant farms with jump drives. Mining outposts on distant moons. Starfighters, cargo hoppers, unstoppable killing machines. We owned the stars. Especially the stars we took from our mortal enemies, the Zirax Empire. Freaking lizards. Die.

One of these friends was enduring frequent complications from leukemia recovery. He would mine entire asteroids by himself due to being constantly awake from steroids. He loved to call it roid rage, and that joke never got old.

A few months ago, his body finally gave in. He passed away peacefully, surrounded by family. We wore Jedi robes to his funeral. I still have our dedicated server sitting on the box I hosted it from. I keep wanting to fire it up and continue the adventure, but you have no idea how difficult that is now.

Anyway, Eleon has created something truly wonderful here. There have been bugs and development struggles over the years, but no other game like it has captured the essence of cooperative gameplay for me like this one. It has a bit of a learning curve, but once you figure out the tech tree and get proficient at slaughtering wildlife, it really opens up. Some of the blueprints in the workshop are absolute works of art. For the more creative types, you can build anything you can imagine, paint it any color you want, strap engines and weapons to it, and even put gaudy flashing signage and obnoxious blinking rave lights all over. The planets are beautiful. The sunsets/sunrises are beautiful. The galaxy is beautiful. You can leave your base behind and frolick about the galaxy, living out all your favorite space pirate fantasies. You can pretty much do anything but build a submarine (for now!) Oh, and there are dinosaurs. Lots of dinosaurs.

Most importantly, you can have a great time with your friends. You never know how long that will last. Make it count.",1638423512,1638423512,True,437,7,0.956560373306274414,15,True,False,False

And, oh boy, if you do not sacrifice your time to play free bug tester you do not have any right to complain about these bugs.

Technically the idea of the game is great. But the execution is so incredibly subpar and the devs do not seem to have any coherent plan and are operating way outside their scope. They are a 7-people team working in their spare time on a freakin universe. Every normal thinking human should now be totally aware of how long this may take.

This game has (sometimes critical) bugs that seem to be unfixable. Ships that do not stay docked, stuff that disappears. AI that is so horrible that it stops being funny quite quickly. While at the same time plasticy looking weapons and now even planet decorations get added, which seriously was one of the least problems this game has.

Every update breaks your savegame. If it doesn't do this by itself then YOU will break it. Because new stuff that comes with updates often require a new game to take effect. And if it is not the base game that breaks then it is one of the scenarios (speak: mods; same rules apply, most of the stuff requires a new savegame to take effect) that are beasically mandatory to play. Why mandatory? Because the modders are what actually keeps the game afloat. They're the ones trying to fix a messy AI, poorly thought out game mechanics and fill the empty, shallow void this game is. And that is the devs way to go. People asked for new crosshairs. What did they get? A way to implement new crosshairs into a scenario. Why is that a problem?

There are many ambitious features in Empyrion. Some of them are great. A vast galaxy with thousands of planets to explore. You can be very creative in building ships and stations. Some of the survival mechanics (like status effects f.e.) are still pretty good even after many years.

Sadly, though, the positives Empyrion has to offer are drowned in mountains of unfinished and sometimes downright terribly implemented elements. The game literally has no polish whatsoever. And unless you have the godlike patience to ignore and work around all of them, you're going to have a bad time. Some examples:

- NPC AI and its pathfinding is terrible to the point of broken. Even after the recent update NPCs don't manage the simplest of movements, get stuck frequently, behave in completely illogical ways and just straight up don't work in any way they're supposed to. The simplest bots in games from 1990 did better than this. And I'm not exaggerating here. It's really that bad. You can be attacked by a horde of raptors... and kill them all by just walking to any shoreline or standing on any rock, where they will then patiently sit for you to kill them.

- Character animation and movement is just about non-existent. It has no logical mechanics to it. The character slides around as if on ice skates. ""Swimming"" in water, you fall to the ground of a lake the second you hold an object in your hand. The best way of moving around on foot is jetpack jumping, since your character leaps 20 meters with ease (g forces and inertia be damned) and doesn't use stamina doing so. Just about everything related to the character and the way it moves in the game world either makes no sense logically or just is implemented in a way that makes it completely break any sense of immersion.

- Sound. Just turn it off if you value your sanity and eardrums. You fire at an NPC and it'll play the exact same ridiculously loud and annoying hit sound overlapping dozens of times to the point where your speakers just vomit a soup of abominable noise at you. It's so bad that an NPC doesn't even have to damage you ingame, it'll win damaging you in real life by literally hurting your ears.
Most of the sounds (and weapons in particular) play in completely static intervals and loops with no limits or logic to what triggers them. And if that's not enough, most of them are super annoying old stock sound effects with terrible audio fidelity. It's as if Eleon literally went to freesound and just downloaded the worst SFX they could find to put in the game.
Even I, with little to no experience in game audio, could 10X improve every single sound effect in this game using nothing but random samples and no more than a few hours of editing with Audacity. I just don't understand why it seems so difficult for Eleon to put some sounds in the game that don't produce physical harm to the player's ears, and them trigger in a way that isn't so awkwardly and predictably bad and immersion breaking. Unity as a game engine offers so many way to make sound good. None of them are used here.

- Physics. By and large non existent. You can slam your ship into the ground at full speed without consequence, but don't you dare moving your character around in your ship while it's moving. And even if you don't, do not be surprised when you find your character float in space all of a sudden, miles away from your ship, due to some random movement or sync related bug booting you out of your seat to leave you to die of radiation.

- Weapons and gunplay. Can be described as super basic, at best. Don't be surprised when NPCs aimbot you through walls. Crouching, leaning, anything at all you could consider FPS mechanics you won't find in this game. Luckily it's not a real concern at the end of the day, since the NPC AI is so bad that they wouldn't make a difference even if they were good.

I could go on and on here. And I'm actually really kind of sad about it because I really like the premise and ambition of the game. Unfortunately, Eleon Game Studios has spent a few too many years ""improving"" the game in areas that don't matter, while most of the core features that make and break a good FPS experience are left in the dust to rot as broken placeholders.
Them now adding pretty water effects does little to fuel any enthusiasm for the game as long as the few key and important areas remain in such an abysmally bad state.

All of those issues I was happy to ignore, to an extent, when the game was still EA. It's where most of my 560 hours with it was spent. Years after its official release however, one really struggles to come up with excuses for why so many of Empyrion's features are still in such bad shape. And I hope Eleon gets around to at least try to fix some of them before the last of their community jumps ship someplace else.",1517209241,1638289380,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The physics are extremely clunky, and more than half of the weapons share the same reload sounds and animations. The game was released into early access in 2015 and went into full release in 2020, which is good, until i notice that they hardly made any changes with the weapons. They still have the same animations from years ago, the only difference is the addition of a rough ADS system and a couple graphical updates. The animations themselves are severely buggy looking and lacking, especially for a game that was in early access for 5 years. When you reload the laser pistol T2 for example, your hand just phases through the scope that's on it. Another blaring issue is the movement, good god the movement is clunky. And on top of that, it feels like your character is trying to run a marathon on an ice rink all the time. The ship building feels rather difficult too, if you're trying to build a capital vessel, your only option is seemingly to build it in space. The blocks you use are the same size as the ones for your base, and your jet pack will never be good enough to build a decently large sized ship comfortably. The story isn't bad per say, but just expect a lot of pointless running around. Every time I get sent for a simple task, it turns into some drawn out adventure that doesn't have hardly any meaning. I go to collect some beer then subsequently tasked with getting the recipe for said beer and give it to a guy at a distillery to brew beer. And somehow, the prize I get for delivering beer, is a handy dandy epic drill someone just happened to leave at a nightclub for you. The story is never voiced, so just be ready to wear your reading glasses.
In conclusion, the scope of the game is very ambitious, but still an early access title. If the game wasn't ready, you should have kept it in early access, but i suppose 5 years is a big chunk of time. Until these simple issues that have been present since launch are fixed, this game is not something I want to recommend to others.

Grow crops and hunt animals for food, and raid alien bases for better armor and weapons to protect you against the relentless cold of space and the deadly radiation of a barren moon.
This game has come a long ways from the bare-bones sandbox it was in 2015, and the developers have been faithfully working on it, improving the aesthetics tremendously and adding functionality with each patch, working steadily through their milestones; As an alpha, it already has more that enough content to be worth its price tag, and has a 'finished game' feel to it.
For those of you who are ""creatively challenged"" and don't want to build bases and vehicles from scratch, don't worry. 
 Empyrion also has the tools for you: A Blueprints factory, which allows blueprints for fantastic user content to be downloaded from the Steam Workshop.  With these blueprints, all you have to do is collect the needed materials, press a single button, then wait an hour or two for you brand new base or capital vessel.

Essentially Empyrion is a survival game. But its really quite massive in the things that you can do and the scope and scale of it all. You start off on a planet with not much usually after crash landing in an escape pod. The start is slow and can be challanging at the start although its really good fun. Once you get the tech skills up you can build a ship and head for the moon or a planet in the system. Different ship and the ability to create your own or download blueprints from the steam workshop make it even more interesting.

There are several alien races to trade with or battle as you wish and the evil empire headed up by the Zirax is the main protagonist.

Visually the game is excellent. Ive seen much improved graphics after the last couple of updates and the gameplay is smooth.

The game is still in development but without exagerration this is probably withdoubt one of my favourite all time games.

I would like to see the ability to move around ships in multiplayer while travelling and the introduction of some automated systems for mining. Oh and the warp direction indicator is too small but all that aside I would highly reccomed this game.

Empyrion's largest flaw so far? Cant stand up wile ship is in motion. Warp is one thing. but i mean standard cruising speeds. 
No excuses, Space Engineers does it, without problem.

And the only problem with SE? No map or guidance system overview... yes, a map.

However these are also two extremely different games beyond that similarity. Where Space Engineers spends a lot of it's time and effort in the physics and building engine, Empyrion spent time on creating an actual game to play with an actual purpose and story (and yes I know that there are 'scenarios' available for SE, but those are at best 'mini' stories to explore, not full on settings).

Admittedly the game is still rough around the edges, and while it has moved leagues in relation to where it started; it still has a long way to go before it could be considered a 'polished' experience. Nevertheless it is still an enjoyable and fun time that I can recommend to anyone looking for another game similar to Space Engineers.

I have high hopes for where the game will eventually end up.

PS Make sure you check out the workshop, even if you consider yourself a 'master' builder there are a plethora of awesome works available to import into your game from a number of skilled creators.

The trees and terrain look like some mid 2000 game. The character sound effects are so weird. Like the character suddenly starts grunting or seems out of breath and falls completely silent 2 seconds later. Also the game doesnt care about your screen resolution and will start out as some odd number in windowed mode. I guess playing in windowed mode is very popular wherever they are from? For a sandbox survival game it just seems weird. Also two steps in the tutorial were broken in my world.. but I dont think new players is too much of a worry.

What pisses me off so much is that much of that is incredibly easy to fix. Just remove those goofy character sounds (silence is preferable to having them), pay a few hundred bucks for some generic environment assets that dont look like ass (seriously look up how much gorgeous looking trees go for in unity asset store) and set the game to fullscreen (or windowed full screen) using current desktop resolution.

Thats like a week of work that would make all the difference to new players. The trajectory of a game should be the #1 priority in a review and this game is going nowhere. Its been in early access for years and instead of making it presentable the devs are busy catering to the most hardcore fans.

The good: 
-Exploration. I'll give the game that.. there's a TON of point of interest to explore. On multiple planets.
-Building stuff in general is pretty clunky/awkward but can give some real sweet bases/ships once you invest enough time.
-Game look okay.
-Worlds are pretty populated with plenty of ambiant AIs animals/critters (with different behaviors) or stuff to pick up. Even moons.

The bad: 
-Game feel like a N64/PS1 era game. All very slow, clunky, floaty. 
-Story/mission system are often bugged and just uninteresting/unengaging with how we interact with it.
-Combat. Its bad on foot and in vehicles/ships in all the ways that matter. Not fun at all.
-Survival being only a ""challenge"" for like an hour or two at the start of the game, then its so trivial i just wonder why its still there.
-UI/UX in general is just really dated.

I dunno) is just absurd.

All in all.. It get exploration right with quantity of POI and ""living"" worlds. It fails with its combat systems/mechanics utterly. Its so-so with building/crafting. General game feel is meh/floaty.

What caused me a great deal of annoyance in the beginning, is the constant Zyrax attacks.
I am playing with a friend, on a private PVP server (we actually play co-op, so this is PVE).
We had to learn how to deal with the fact that on the server one day passes in 20 real-time minutes, so our fuel tanks will definitely go dry until our next login (hence, base defenses go offline, food spoils, etc.). The underground base concept helped with avoiding the Zyrax attacks.
Now we are at the phase when we have small ships, did leave the planet for a quick tour to a nearby planet, made it back with some stuff, and also we can roam freely in our starting planet, exploring the leftover bases and crashed ships, and clearing out one or two Zyrax bases in our path.
I must admit that the concept of leaving the planet, and travelling to another one is a huge thing from gameplay point of view. Not to mention building bases in space (which we did not try yet).
What I really admire is the templates, how well those vehicles and bases are designed.

The dedicated server settings are a bit lacking, comparing to ARK, but the gameplay is on the next level. I wish the graphics would be better, but I can enjoy it as it is.

I decided to leave my original review here, because that is where some comments arrived (to which I am grateful).

This was my original review:
==============================================================
I like the concept, I can look over the glitches and the bad graphic, but I cannot get over the fact that this game is not enjoyable for a beginner like me. I started on a private PVP server, chose the lowest difficulty, and even this way the Zyraxes are attacking as soon as I put down a base foundation. They never let me be, and if I go and try to clean their bases (so their attack would stop), those bases regenerate. Even after I turned this off in the server settings. No problem, there is a solution to remove a base completely: you have to remove all its building blocks. But there are SO MANY Zyrax bases on the easiest planet, and the are SO OVERPOWERED that I feel this game is more like a struggle than something I could enjoy after my work hours. I don't want to spend days, or possibly weeks cleaning up the surface of the easiest planet of the Zyrax bases, just to start playing the way I wanted from the beginning. At peace.

There is no way to start the game without these damn Zyraxes constantly bugging me. They give me no opportunity to learn the game, to build and to develop something.

Feel free to comment here if I missed something important that would help me enjoying this game. I would like to give it another chance.",1636745162,1637436497,True,0,0,0.574896931648254395,9,True,False,False

The amount of depth you'll find hidden underneath its scuffed exterior will suck hundreds of hours of your life as you explore, trade and fight your way around the near-infinite universe while gradually accumulating wealth, reputation and bigger guns.

All ships and bases are user-created designs, fully modifiable to your liking, down to the block. Build as big or as small as you can imagine. Check the steam workshop to see how other players have spent thousands of hours putting together their creations for you to use (or take apart!).

With the Reforged Eden mod (which comes configured on something like 90% of servers), Empyrion goes from It's Alright to Incredible. So much so that I would consider it mandatory for all players.

That's primarily because on my computer this has become almost unplayable.  Turning down the settings and being ridiculously patient with it allows me to play, but it's ... oh my god it's painful.  My (now) 5 year old computer is clearly not up to the task, but I certainly don't remember having these performance problems with the earlier version.  Now, it constantly complains about low memory and I think the engine keeps failing and partially resetting or something - it limps along taking many many minutes to load.  And when playing it will all too often slow to an absolute crawl, seizing up for many seconds at a time.  It's a real challenge to get past.

And the basic game hasn't changed that much, at least on the surface.  I see that planets are now actually spherical, which is nice, even though they still have dead-zone polar regions and a weird strip down the 'international date line' where presumably the maths doesn't work properly.  And the universe certainly seems big now, with large regions of space to traverse, potentially.  But the tech tree looks basically the same and the resources seem the same; the base/HV/SV/CV construction seems largely unchanged - oh, solar panels are a good, if minor, addition.  I do like what I could play of the story that has been added - it's got some nice elements and it is a decent bit of motivation to get out and do stuff.  But I had a lot of problems with the story missions frequently breaking and not updating, which I could work around by going back to previous saves and trying things slightly differently ... until I couldn't do that at a particular stage.

But yeah.  The performance issues were a killer for me.  There's still some good enjoyable aspects to this game, but ... perhaps if you have a much beefier machine your mileage may vary.  My original review still stands since it's largely the same game:

*** initial early access review ***:

This is a preliminary recommendation.


There are some fantastic elements here, and a lot of fun and satisfaction to be had already.

However, the overall game is still missing some crucial elements to give the game a rounded-out sense of purpose - in my opinion there needs to be a better balance of long term stress to keep you needing to move forward, as well as fleshing out the technology and resource pathways to be deeper and more developed over time.

The framework is there, and I can see how these things could be slotted in fairly easily into the game as it stands so I hope it gets the attention in the areas it needs to be a truly outstanding game.

I've only played the single player - PvP holds zero interest, although I can see the multiplayer would be quite a different experience in itself.

A particular focus in the game is on creating structures - bases, vehicles - and despite the current fairly simplistic elements it is a lot of fun trying out different arrangements of things and getting it wrong before getting it right.  The system is tolerant and flexible, and tweaking and adjusting your hover vehicle or capital ship and taking them for a spin to go explore and rip enemy structures to shreds is very rewarding.

I look forward to seeing where they take this game.  There's not quite enough to keep striving for to keep me addicted for now, but hopefully it gets there.

However, the game is not perfect, so I have a few complaints.  A lot of the missions, particularly the story campaign, can be buggy.  Sometimes mission flags do not trigger, and you are forced to either load a prior save or use the in-game function to auto-complete the broken objective.  The thing is that everything usually works, but then sometimes it doesn’t, and it’s seemingly at random.  I’ve noticed that doing a side mission while in the middle of a story campaign can break the quest line so even the in game function won’t work. 

AI can be buggy or just plain stupid with completely oblivious enemies.  

At times the game offers little direction and gives vague instructions with missions.  The tutorial for in game functions is lacking outside of basic gameplay mechanics.

Great game!
This is a true gem in my steam list, it has got everything that floats my boat.
Building, crafting, immersion, fighting, exploration.
But most of all... The immersion level is great. 
This game is what no man´s sky promised to be. 
They couldn´t make their promises true, yet Eleon kept working and truly delivered on this one. 
I am not overreacting to say this is a work of art. 
Sometimes you might bump into a rough edge here and there as some aspects/mechanics might be WIP.
But the amount of content and mechanics that are already in are worth waaaaaay more than the 20 bucks imo. 
It's a product of love and labour. One of the rare games nowadays that is solely focused on fun and enjoyment. 
I truly have the idea the developers have a passion for this game and what they had envisioned. 

PROS
- Building is very immersive and satisfying, all shapes and items and stuff give instant connection to your labour and make the ships you fly in feel very much your own. Super satisfying to discover all the noob speed bumps and overcome them (like having no thrusters on the front and then not being able to brake). 
- The natural skill & item progression is well balanced, it does not feel slow and is precisely timed. Each steps feels like an achievement and not rushed or too slow. Then when the top tiers have been achieved, there is a whole galaxy out there waiting to be explored. 
- Exploration is very immersive. Flying in and out of planets, to other star systems. The scanning for new objects and resources, different types of star systems. It feels like stellaris but then in 3D. Just wow. 
- The combat feels nice and exploring POI's is fun. It's immersive. 
- Some vista's of planets and suns just make me pause and go (ahhh its so pretty) inside. How often does a game do that to you? It feels like being a proper space explorer. 

CONS
- the survival aspect is fun but could be a little bit better, base attacks aren't that developed yet. Holds potential for more fun stuff (alien spider swarm attack or something). 
- Some aliens/things are placeholders. Finding a pack of raptors or a triceratops is a bit immersion breaking imo. I would like to see creatures stick to one planet/ecosystems. 
- not really a con because it is already good but the different ecosystems/planet types could be a little more immersive. Like lava planets have a thick smoke and boulders flying everywhere. Swamp planets with more lush specific vegetation etc. There is a lot more room for improvement and im hoping the DEV's keep working on this title.

The first part (getting off a planet after you crash land with almost no equipment) is really good and rewarding when you do so, given how much you need to do to build a Capital Vessel (that can warp to another system). 

There are times when you will be so frustrated as you run out of food or don't have the right type of medicine to cure that venomous bite you've just got, or some enemy drones come and shoot your base to pieces for no apparent reason, but even these frustrating parts are fun. In fact this part could be a standalone game for me.

The second part (exploring other planets/systems) is flawed for me as there's no real motive for doing so. You can land your CV on the planet & take all resources you gathered/created before with you, so it really becomes a sightseeing trip and doesn't fit in with the survival theme (actually most of the structures and features are just repeated across each planet so even the sightseeing is pointless).

There are some rough edges like the 90s Doom style graphics, the awkward controls for placing bulding blocks and driving vessels (especially the Motorbike & the fact that steering on other vessels defaults on yaw instead of turn) but I feel the gameplay is strong enough to make these minor annoyances rather than reasons not to buy.

+ Interesting concept and gameplay
+ Large variety of content (hundreds of different food types/materials/weapons)
+ Huge scale galaxy
+ Plenty of pre-designed bases and ships which is a great addition to this type of game

- Graphics are poor at times : interior areas especially look very blocky and of low resolution. However, at other times graphics are great so...
- Controls are awkward and take some getting used to.
- Could some of the resources used for creating the countless other systems have been used to improve the survival ""get off the planet"" part given going to other planets is pretty pointless?

and i've tried ALOT of them.
THIS one has:

+Positives
+decently optimised & doesn't require a top tier machine. I'm on like a decade old cpu & gtx 970 iirc. 8/10
+Has a wide library of Workshop blueprints for bases & ships that you can download & use. 7/10
+The tutorial takes you from the very start up till ""and from here you can survive and make it to end-game with minimal learning gaps"" and is decently enough done. (buut it has 1-3 issues that WILL make you google the fix cuz developers can't be bothered to fix the damn tutorial i guess??) 7/10
+building and painting/texturing is simple to do and complex enough that it's ""well done"" (that said there are a few block shapes where you get Part A,B,C. But to finish the shape you'd need D & E too.. >.> and no mods that add those in asfar i can see)   7/10 
+I was honestly kinda surpised & amused to notice planets seem to actually spin and astroids/moons ""orbit them"" (as seen from the ground), and the bloody planets orbit the sun. adds nice touches of realism (and i'm only now getting sad that bad games got me to apreciate what is essentially normal lmao) 9/10
+pretty active online servers (not even including the massive amount of people that play the MODDED Eden servers)

= ""neutrals""
=npc shopkeepers, factions & enemies auto-added, decent enough variety but i've read plenty of complaints/suggestions from end-game players that request more variety.
=forcefield hangar bays to keep oxygen in are always nice
=futuristic laser weaponry is always nice

-Negatives:
-sadly i think there is only one real MOD for this game? and ""all it does"" is ""make the game harder imo"" (and alot of other stuff! it's HUGE)
if i'm wrong: make finding a collection of MODS not a page 3 google thing ffs.
where's my working Stargates? (Space Engineers may be badly optimised & abandoned by the devs, but atleast they have thousands of mods)
-there are a few gaps in the tutorial that WILL require some googling. nothing major but you'll lose some time bashing your head against a wall. >.>
-while i do think the tutorial is pretty damn good and teaches you almost everything, i feel like there HAS to be a better way then ""wasting"" most of a full real life day playing a tutorial before you start a ""new world""
(which is why I still am playing in my tutorial universe *shrug* )


the negatives are small & few.
the positives are that ""it's better then most and has a great average""
but that aside.. It's the best one i've come across sofar and i'll be playing this till i find a better one.

Graphics are terrible for a game released in 2020. Definitely looks like it was made 20 years ago.
Movement mechanics are even worse than the graphics. wow. so bad. 

Took me 3-4 hours of game play to get enough resources to start building a base. The online players said I should just keep going because the base building is worth it. Started building my first base and lost interest straight away.

Tried to get a refund from steam and they refused as I had played to many hours. It literaly takes 4 hours to get to the part of the game I was interested in but they won't refund.

So the game lures you in with false promises and a slow start to get you to play more than 4 hours so that you can't get a refund when you see how trash it is.

How to get people to buy your weak game in 2020 and not be able to refund it.

It wasn't a procedurally generated map, it had some graphics quirks but the game play was good - challenging even. You had to work swiftly and steadily towards advancing your tech tree and making the necessary things to survive a world of no oxygen and restless creatures that want you for lunch.

Now it's a constant pain with overly frequent, multi-gigabyte updates that eat up my band with for my hotspot for the month. Many of the graphics glitches that were present in the first early releases are still present. After the latest ""update"" it now takes 10 full minutes to load into my saved game, and the save game selecting screen is glitched, as well. The developers left the survival aspect behind long ago in what seems like an attempt to recreate or compete with another popular space building and combat game.

If you took a college course on computer programming and game development, and went into the section concerning ""program bloat"" this is the program the course would use as it's prime example. 
When you studied the section on the ""pitfalls of a game developer trying to include absolutely everything the early access players requested"" this game would be the prime example.
When you studied the section of the problems of masking program bugs by adding features that side step them rather than fixing them, this would be the topic example.

I can't tell you if the game loads and runs smoothly on the latest and greatest gazillion core computer with memory out the wazoo and a 2000 dollar graphics card, because I don't own such a system. I can tell you if your system is a typical system of six to eight years ago, your experience will be miserable with constant freeze frame (game lag) game play, usually at the most critical times; the game WILL at some point lock up when you transition from the planet into space ... just too many bugs to list that dedicated fans have accepted as ""just part of the game"".

The only reason I keep it on my computer and wait out the ten minute load time is because it cleans system memory (known as ""garbage collection"") better than any software tool written for that specific purpose. I have 4 Gigabytes that is dedicated to data cache that hogs memory and 2 gigs containing background TSRs, load up a saved game and immediately exit. Suddenly I have less than a gigabyte of ""used "" memory, no cached data in memory and 90% free memory.

It will allow you to play without forcing crap down your throat, without injecting any part of the lgbtq alphabet soup into it. This is just a pure semi-sandbox game that you can destroy nearly everypart of your environment and have a grand ole time doing so.

On a scale of 1-10 for replayability, I give it a 9. I SHOULD give it a 10, but I am reserving that for a better game. This game has you starting out the same way each time, you crash to a planet (you might get to pick) and you have to scramble to survive with the minimum technology you have with you. The first 3+ hours of the restarts are usually my favorites... The survival aspect REALLY is a lot of fun here. I have replayed this game dozens of times with NEVER the same experience. 

Mechanics hits an 8.4 since it really SUCKS that you have a range of 176m on your gun and the game caps the draw distance of the zirax at like 105m. So they are invisible until they get within 105m or closer and then your sniper rifle is equivalent to their laser rifle or their battle rifle... THAT is irritating, but not a game breaker.  Get into a ship- THAT YOU BUILT and fly around with shields gunning down poor little zirax soldiers in the battle field and rack up loads of experience points and not to mention friend points with other factions who also do not like the zirax.  Another issue I have with mechanics is the hitbox tends to SUCK at times. if a zirax or enemy is hiding behind a tree partially, and you have a shot at them. Taking the shot menas you shoot the tree even though you are aimed right on their shoulder or leg or whatever is sticking out. You have to move over MORE to get an accurate shot. Irritating at times. Now when you build you also have to beware where you put your engines/thrusters for maximum effect. Putting a jet engine in the middle will not be as effective as putting it at the edge of the frame now...

Building is a 7.8 but by being able to go outside the game, look at OTHER ships that OTHER people have made for the game, you can SAVE those blueprints, then while playing the game, open up your blueprint factory and start dumping materials into that blueprint to finally spawn it as a real ship in the game. There are currently over 100k items you can spawn into the game at this point. Everything from bases to capital vessels to hover bikes and small vessels... You can build your own outside the game. then spawn in your game and use it to fly around or for something specific... Of course, building a ship from scratch in an actual game can be done and IS done early on, but it is kinda clunky to match up and rotate shaped blocks everywhere so that you do not make a flying cube or whatever. 

Versatility is a 9.1 because you can loot bases and find cool alien containers with stuff in them and then go sell it off or in some cases there is no market so you gotta keep it. Then you can build things to sell and make money or just keep turning in spoils of war to various trade stations that you will find throughout the game. 

Modability is a 9.7.   Let's face it, the vanilla version of this game is hella fun! It kept me happy since 2017-2019. BUT Once I discovered REFORGED EDEN which was a project eden (many new starting scenarios and locations) combinded with a REFORGED GALAXY (rebalancing of the game) with a bunch of new planets and POIs added in, I was like- TAKE MY MONEY!  Even though I had already paid for it. Oh and yes, the planets! the wonderful planets that are so many I do not know how many different planets there are, but DAMN! Some are great at being a home base for you, others not so great. It will be up to you to decide if you want to be a nomad or live on a planet and build up resources for fighting...

All in all, if you grew up with LEGOS and are mildly creative, then THIS could very well be your game. Combine that having to live on a planet where things USUALLY are trying to kill you, you gotta keep up your food and oxygen level, AND you gotta find safety so you can settle down to make things and gather your thoughts on what you need to do next to survive, and you gotta a whole handful of things to keep track of. It makes for a fun game indeed. 

Finally, this is just a simple survival game with beautiful if not decent graphics and it allows you to just be yourself and let your actions dictate what kind of reputation you will get.

The game itself is okay. It's fun to build ships, explore, setup a teleport network (which is the cats meow) to travel effectively across the local stars. In a way, this game is sort of like Minecraft meets a space sim. The ability to create a ship to your specifications is awesome. This would be akin to Space Engineers however, it's how they handle the different mechanics in the background that really sets them apart.

E.g. Space Engineers has ship collision damage whereas Empyrion doesn't. Due to this, Empyrion seems to handle larger ships easier, say a multi-Capital Vessel fight doesn't lag near as hard as Space Engineers. The game(Empyrion) basically just ignores those values so it doesn't have to spend time calculating it seems.

I personally play on a mod called Reforged Eden(mod devs are awesome) so a lot of the base game stuff is different. It seems to be balanced a lot better, at least for me.

The glaringly painful cons are:
Ground enemies are dumb and, overpowered most of the time (even with armor, it seemingly does nothing to reduce damage)
Death-loops are real (if you forget to put down a survival tent before raiding a ground POI you get to enjoy this loop)
Blueprints are local files. (If you wipe your computer (which I do often) you lose those files) Manual backups are a must.

Space exploration is painful, at best.

I'm going to spend some time on this because this is honestly the overall reason for a negative review. A series of missions will send you out among the stars (500-600LY) with a max jump of 60LY. As such, you have to plot your course along star system to star system to reach your end destination. That sounds alright until you realize that there is basically NO navigational system methods. You're forced to reverse engineer your route from either the starting point or the end point. There are warp lines but half the time they don't show up (not close enough, wrong axis plane) and, it's pretty difficult (at least for me) to follow the exact same path more than once.

Overall, I would pick this game up, on sale sure, even off sale I think it holds immense value depending on your play style. (E.g. if you like space, it's worth it. If you're a COD Warzone fanboi, skip this.)

This game holds enough value, base game then plus mods, that it warrants your own opinion. Find out for yourself if you like it or not. I would pay full price for this game, if I had to do it over again.

Also, I'm in no way saying that space exploration should be easy but, this isn't difficult...it's just painful for no reason.",1635356965,1635356965,False,5,0,0.501231133937835693,0,True,False,False

First off, this game has more than a few flaws to be certain. Empyrion's character animation looks like something out of a alpha release. When you use your jet pack, your character animation shows your character as running. SMH. I'm sometimes dumbfounded at how the devs left the character animation in that condition. As well, there are some multiplayer issues, and issues with the questing system as well.

On the bright side, the game's user interface, the build system, its inventory management, and the variety of locales for exploring are all major positives for this game. I especially like how expansive the game is. On a busy server, you can explore all day and not see a single person, or you can go to a busier system and find people with whom you could join.

I have played almost 4000 hours on this game. 

PVP is Realy in this game, all but dead. So if your thinking of buying this game for pvp I would suggest look else where

PVE is where the game realy is.

Build your own style capital vessel and go explore. Set up your own base, call it your home grow crops collect ore from alien base attack, go mine, trade Be a loan pilot or explore with your faction /friends 

Attack aliens  or  become honored .  Place homing rockets, artilary or lasers on your cv and attack every alien you come across. But be care full before you know it alien fighters and large capital vessels  are ganging up on you. When you least expect it.Go down to any planet but watch out some planets have some nasty creatures that like to give you a nasty infection 

I have been exploring the galaxy without returning to my base for 6 days now. I continue to explore and attack zirax factions and profet from anything i get from them. 


There are some not so good things with this game aliens (NPC) Do look rather dated. The turrets on capital vessels also look dated. NPC faction capital vessels quite often are a bit wooden and don`t move as much as you would expect. This is the same with the small npc fighters. 

But for a PVE experience online or solo the negatives are not that much of a bother for me.

Quite often i hear on a server discord i play on ""There is so much to do every day"" How can people say they get bored.

Let your mind juices flow to create small vessels, capital ships, hover vessels, bases, space stations, space colonies even, etc. This is probably where most of my time in this game has gone into.
Up for some challenge?  Plenty of POIs (alien/enemy land bases or structures, alien/enemy space stations/outposts, enemy capital ships) to go shoot and explode. Keeps you on your toes, but not being so punishing if you were to fail (it's a survival game so you will).
If you are more into the exploration, you can go around the galaxy exploring planets and sectors, and/or looking around for salvages or valuable resources such as gold.
Want to get a base or vehicle of some kind? Consider the factory if you don't want to do it from scratch. You can browse the workshop for amazing ideas which you can take as is or modify them as you wish on the easily accessible Creative Scenario to then spawn that modified base or vehicle in your game through the factory (still need to farm for the base resources to get it into the game ofc!). 


Few cons:
- If there was a pet peeve that I could point out is that it lacks polish, the most glaring is probably entity animation. Don't expect to customize your character, style, emote, crouch or see fluid enemy movements.
- If you care about graphics it will be a hard barrier to get through, specially if you've played other space/builder games. But if you are trying to find an alternative to Minecraft, this might feel quite feature limited but it's still worth trying imo.",1634400911,1634401149,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I would like to compare it to space engineers but honestly, the only things they have in common are ships and space. This game does NOT play as Space engineers so don't expect that. This a lot more arcade and a LOT more firepower.

Currently doing a reforged eden playthrough with a friend, we're slowly making progress, playing with all settings on maximum difficulty. 

Our journey began on Haven, we crashed next to a smaller hill which we decided to dig out and call home, for now. After doing some biking around we noticed hostile lifeforms were absent from this planet. So we decided to start a war against the friendly tribe roughly 2km away from us. We started producing shotgun shells and sniper rounds, we were preparing for war. 

We attacked them at dawn, killing each and everyone, looting all their food and resources. The war was intense but short-lived. We were victorious. 

We have now made enough materials to begin building our small vessel, preparing for space exploration. Once our ship was built we realised we were out of fuel. We knew all too well that getting more would mean risking our lives in the radiated zone. So we prepared for another mission into the green fog. Once there we found an ancient obelisk which contained a rare alien container, easy enough we made our way to the top only to realise aliens were hiding at the bottom. They made quick work of us. We died. 

Back at our hole in the hill we began producing bio fuel for our vessel, we equipped it with a drill and we went back into the fog, this time successfully gathered promethium.

The time had come for us to journey out into the unknown. Blasting off the planet in lightning speed, warping through reality and arriving at alpha 2. We were not prepared.

If you enjoy unforgiving survival games where a simple mistake can set you back hours you will love this.

In exchange for these minor inconveniences, Empyrion offers a galaxy of adventure and a level of freedom I haven't encountered elsewhere.

It has so many levels of gameplay that it would give the (eventually) finished Star Citizen a run for its money. Spaceship and base design alone are almost a complete game upon themselves. Survival and progress can be tough at first but you eventually get to the point where you have enough of everything to design and play any way you want.

Pros? 

You can pretty much do anything - '

Cons? 

The tutorial can be a little fuzzy - and essentially pushes you into the story, which is not bad, however it is a slog to get through especially not REALLY telling you what you should be doing. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Realism is hit or miss - Enemies kinda have a spotty existence - (much like Minecraft) 

The AI entities are a little screwy - Walking into a base is about as exciting as a Minecraft village, but it has its moments. 

Resources are going to be your main play-style. 

Want to fly a massive capital ship across the galaxy? YOU CAN! But it will take tons of this that and the other, some of which you need to warp to other systems for... Which means you need more resources... There is no way to really generate Oxygen on a space station or ship - so be prepared to make it on a planet and ferry it up... Save up to build the prefab space station? YESSS!!! OOPS your ship wont fit - so build a landing pad... 

All in all this game is awesome - however the lack of real AI interaction makes it so much like minecraft that its just sitting there playing with yourself. You can play with friends - however I have not tried such, but looking at the servers available, you wont find anything close to EVE or STO - which this game could surpass given a large enough server setup.

I was excited to try this out when it went on sale. It looks good on the videos But in all seriousness the concepts brought forward are simply less developed than Space Engineers. The gun play and vehicles both feel floaty, and the vehicles themselves are cartoonish in reference to the rest of the graphics when you're in the game.

AI enemies are extremely basic, less intelligent than Oblivion. Detect player, approach, inflict damage. Ranged enemies just try to shoot without moving at all. quite often I had enemies spawning in preset locations before my eyes, and didn't move even after shooting them.

Base construction is interesting, until you realize its method of using a Core and block connections means you need to manage CPU useage against base expansion, and expansion is locked behind levels. The game drives you to persue its poor implimentation of RPG quests. An example of one: I was instructed to clear out a temple nearby of spiders and find their nest. I went in, decimating any opponent due to poor AI, and at one point the quest said to open a door with a lever. However, you are able to open the door through interacting with it directly, and I did so. I was interested in my environment more than the tiny quest text, so when I fought my way to the bottom of the temple to find an imprisoned scientist, who told me the place was about to blow up, I rushed out....and was confused when it didn't blow up. It was only then I noticed the quest text said pull a lever, and spend half an hour figuring out which one.

My experience in this game boiled down to fighting bugs more than enjoying my time, and I don't mean the basic and abundant spider enemy.

It was also not mentioned that in order to play multiplayer, you need to set up your own dedicated server, which means a system strong enough to run both a dedicated server as well as the game proper, or a separate PC with 16 gigs of ram that can handle a dedicated server.",1633064218,1633064372,False,9,0,0.559884548187255859,0,True,False,False

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have been playing Empyrion Galactic Survival since 2016 when it was in Early Access. The Dev's have been updating the game regularly and now it has grown into something incredible! It essentially is a survival game with focus on building stuff using resources and researching technology with a lot of science and science fiction thrown in. Set in the future, you and large team are visiting a system some 10-20 light years away. There is a problem and when the game starts, you are entering the planet's atmosphere on an escape pod. You crash on a chosen planet (there are 20+ planet types!) and only have some essential items. Essentially you have no contact with your team, there are not in this planet, you have no ship, no nothing!
You just have to tell this to yourself - like in the movie - The Martian
“I'm going to have to science the shit out of this to get out of this planet!!”
And then your adventure starts. All alone in the planet. You gather basic resources - Stone, Iron, Copper, Silicon. Then u gather some wood, Fruits and all kinds of Alien veggies. You craft a personal constructor and a tent and survive the first few nights. The planets the moons and scenes are just spectacular as you get used to your new alien world.
When starting the game, you can choose among many types of planets - Temperate, Desert, Snow planet, Swamp planet, Jungle planet, Ocean, Sandy and so many. Gradually you explore the planet on foot and build a hover vessel and its components. You actually create components from resources like - Ground Repulser Engines, Side, back and forward thrusters, fuel tanks, oxygen tanks etc for the Hover Craft. Creating a vehicle is very satisfying experience.
Exploring this beautiful world with a the silent whirring of the electric hover engine, powered by promethuem fuel cells (which u mine) - is superb. You feel like you are alone in the this large alien planet. But you are not alone. There are POI/Ancient buildings and some areas where there are corporations who have set up trading services. 
I love the exploration aspect of this game. As you explore, you find an ancient civilization and a primitive peaceful alien race called the Talon (Green Area - there is a back story to their history). You also find a Multi System Giant Corporation called the Polaris (Orange area) - you can visit them and trade and get info on where you are etc. The Red faction called the Zirax is the hostile enemy species. If you enter their area, automated drones will chase you!  There are also other POI's from a pink faction called the Legacy - which have some of the scariest sound effects i have ever experienced in any game. Looting those POI's and fighting the enemies is incredibly nerve wracking but satisfying. 
Apart from the surviving, ship building, the game becomes an FPS once you are inside a POI. The shooting, the sci-fi guns and enemies makes this very satisfying!
As am riding my hover craft, some times the game just blows my mind away with so many varied and spectacular views. Shows how freaky, alien worlds will look to the Human eye in the future. It is a beautiful moment.
Then as u gather more resources you build a base. I build simple bases using cement blocks and other materials. You need fuel tank, power generator, fuel cell based and solar power. Hydroponics to grow veggies etc. But i have seen other builders build some gigantic bases! I'm more of an explorer rather than a builder. So a simple base will do for me!
So once u have a base, you can focus on getting some information from the alien species on any human contacts and then find clues about where your fellow humans are. The next step is to build a small jet aircraft called a small vessel and visit the moons of the planet to get more resources like Cobalt, Erestrum, Neodynium, Sathium etc. Once you have a small vessel, you can explore your solar system and visit other planets in the system using warp engines. Once you have enough resources, you can should build a capital vessel to explore other systems. There are 50+ planet systems and a galaxy to explore with an interesting side story/lore of the universe! The scope of this game is incredible!
On top of that there is an active community of scenario builders and modders out there, who create some phenomenal stuff. I would highly recommend a scenario called the 'Reforged Eden', which changes a lot of gameplay mechanics, improves the AI, adds a compelling storyline and quests to the game! I can't play vanilla game anymore as i'm used to Reforged Eden!
I will forever play this game, as there is no game that gives me a sense of wonder, accomplishment and joy as Empyrion.
Hats of to the developers and community of modders and players for keeping this hidden gem going! Highly recommended!",1627887208,1632727588,True,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Update 24th Sept 2021
Returned to the game after 4 years to try it again. I have had the game for 6 years now. Very impressed that the devs are still here working on updates. However, still cannot recommend the game unfortunately, as it is too frustrating. The progress is very slow and after spending a few hours running round trying to repair the signal station I am getting bored. I cannot find copper ( a bug caused a deposit to disappear), mining is very difficult (I get stuck), and to cap it all I will definitely die in a few minutes. Eating food can give you indigestion which in turn leads to food poisoning which in turn leads to death. I can craft medicine to prevent this but cannot find the essential herbal plants so it is off to meet my maker for me, again. And this is the problem, I want to craft a generator and a fuel tank and a core so I can do some wondrous sh*t to get off this planet. I need a capital ship ! I do not want to run around trying to cure a bellyache ffs...
Really hats off the the devs who are probably a small team of 2 or 3 (or 1) and I acknowledge the good steam rating which has been hard earned.

Only to find out that at every major update there will be a wipe consisting of you losing absolutely everything. Even mods like (Virtual Backpack) which is supposed to be a wipe safe storage for wipes will not keep your stuff safe. 

The only way you can keep your items is to pay the people running the server money to manually bring your stuff back into the game after the wipe. So you pay for a game. play it. get invested. just so you can pay server admins again to keep your virtual inventory and keep you from starting out from scratch.

You can still have fun in this game if you go strait to loading some ships and go right to mining and building a ship or base, but never leave them again. Don't play this game with any hopes that the other aspects of this game will amount to anything. It's suppose to be an open world survival, explorer, FPS, sandbox, and more, but all you can do is build ships and bases.

Let's make this clear: This game has officially released. I went through Alpha and Beta, and I came back to see how the full release measures up. The experience and leveling system has not changed at all and should have just been removed before release. There's no point to having an Alpha, Beta, or release if you can't decide to keep or remove entire systems. The animals are still idiots. The FPS combat has not received any attention and is best to just avoid entirely. I've played FPS games since Wolfenstien 3D and even Duck Hunt on the Nintento. I've never played a less fun FPS with such terrible FPS mechanics. I have also never played a less fun survival game. The alien and mission content is boring. There are still placeholder items that have not progressed at all over many years.... and this game has fully released? Even with the potential of this game, there are flaws with game mechanics, physics, and balance issues that would need a lot of work. So, even as I suggested that there are ""possibilities"" of a sandbox PvP, there is no reason to trust in the likelihood of anything.

There is better. If you want to play for the stunning scenery and exploration, there are better games. If you want to play a space builder, there are better games.

**** TL:DR: BUY ON DISCOUNT, INSTALL REFORGED EDEN FOR MAXIMUM BENEFIT ****

E:GS is a game I have put in a surprisingly large amount of time into.  I would not recommend it to casual players who are looking for some combination of base building, crafting and exploration, that's what No Man's Sky is for which I also have spent a lot of time on.

The base game has its moments to shine atleast in the mid to late game, but the truth is that the developers do not have a coherent framework in terms of progression, challenge and story. Game systems and mechanics especially in terms of progression - There is a leveling system which just allow players to unlock craftable items rather than what would have been the more logical choice of improving skills such as mining and combat, or the insanely abused factory system which needs serious rework, or the lack of basic Quality of Life improvements that are too numerous to point out here in terms of both UI and mechanics.

In fact in some areas this game is closer to survival horror - at least when you start hitting what are called Legacy POIs - the game's version of dungeons. And this is where the game would really shine if not for the fact that after a certain point there is little compelling reason to continue. After a short initial difficulty spike, the game becomes laughably easy. thanks in no small part to some of the dumbest AI opponents in a game. 

Fortunately, where the Game Devs dropped the ball, E:GS's modding community has stepped in and created a complete overhaul mod that DRASTICALLY improves on the base game in almost every category. From weapons, equipment, story, enemy difficulty, COHERENCE in terms of story and mechanics that actually integrate into each and a clear campaign with a serious end game, the only way a serious player *should* play this game is with this mod. If that is not good enough the modding community makes some truly astounding creations in terms of ships, vehicles and bases.

I would not recommend E:GS without RE modded and I hope the developers if they continue working on this game start hiring the RE mods to actually integrate their creation into the base game.

Buy on Discount and don't play it without RE installed.

The game is fun, it's not really immersive because of the lack of AI ability, interaction and the games overall buggy state. Building ships and bases are fun and can bring out the creative side and give you a feeling of satisfaction when you finally complete your project. It's a dumb down version of space engineers in some respects but with so much more to do, explore and enjoy. First person combat is janky but again fun, there isn't much survival though so don't look to this game to give you a difficult experience, even with everything set to hard and starting on a hard planet, it's still a very easy game. I like that you can create your own scenarios which I have done to increase the difficulty and try to make it more realistic so it's a nice feature to customise how you wish but requirement of understanding basic coding is needed. It's difficult to recommend the vanilla version over what I have created because I have added over 100 additional ships to multiple factions, traders, planets, systems, weapons, loot etc which is what I play and not the vanilla because it's very lacking and incomplete story lines just doesn't make it worth playing for me.

There are elements I dislike very much, the lack of communication from the dev team regarding issues and complaints from the community. It's almost like they don't see or care about what is really required to make the game great, no response to the reasons why they won't or can't do something like fixing basic mechanics, walking around your ship while it's moving or being able to crouch! That's right you can't crouch in the FPS portion of the game, yet the enemy NPC's can. There are very many bugs, way too many to mention here and a lot of time can break what immersion there is, like teleporting from a station to your ship and arriving in an unknown system floating in space where you will die. The added console option to use a list of commands such as Godmode and going to any system in the galaxy helps combat these issues. Speaking of galaxy, it's huge, thousands of systems with individual sectors procedurally generated gives you plenty to explore but again can get repetitive in the vanilla game. I would also say that the game is definitely more stable than it was but sometimes it does feel like it's still in early access.

Performance can go from being great to horrid, 10 - 15fps depending on whats on screen at one time and i'm running a RTX 3080 at only 1440p!

That all said it doesn't take away from the fact that the game is just good fun and sometimes even it's dated graphics can surprise you with it's prettiness. I play co-op with my girlfriend using the co-op dedicated server feature and we have a blast, she loves it and we love tweaking our scenario to better fit our game play.

I can hands down say if you want to invest the time into understanding this game and maybe checking out some custom created scenarios off the workshop, this game is very much worth the £15 for me it's 1.2p for each hour of fun iv'e had and that makes sense to me.

I do very much recommend this game and it's my most played game on steam.",1631869423,1631869423,True,2,0,0.475485473871231079,0,True,False,False

I know of and have played many games that were in early access/open beta for almost a decade that were ready to be launched. For the product managers/dev stakeholders to call this a finished product is an absolute joke. One word describes this game in relation to a properly finished product, and that word is ""Jank"". Especially in the early stages of the game, the glitches, bugs, and just general ""WTF???"" factor of this game are closer to a closed alpha experienced than a ""complete"" game. So for that, the totally sh*t the bed.

Couple other notable and fairly large Cons:
-I'm running on a dedicated server with friends. They regularly update the game version and the server version. At different times. Often 24-36 hrs apart. 
-Normal basic survival concepts are tracked, but in the case of things like inventory weight, mean absolutely nothing. Just load it up!
-Vast swathes of this game have zero explanation. The ""tutorial quest line"" is like all quest lines, about as strong as wet toilet paper before it breaks/errors and you have to manually just click thru the line. You know they know darn well how jank their quest system is when they just implemented a function to literally click through any quest lol.
-For 22k reviews for the game on Steam, and it being around for years, there is very little in terms of guides that are even a year or two old. 
-Graphics: we're talking 2002 Everquest level mechanics and textures. I will say, I did a full spit take when I saw the ""human"" models ""walking"".
-I'll end it with this. If you get pretty pissy about a small glitch, or bug, or needing to log out and back in to fix something, this is *not* the game for you. Seriously, if you expect lovely packages with a bow on them for your gaming experiences, just keep scrolling, friend. If not...

Pros:
-If technical base/ship building, and exploration/survival is your jam and the above issues aren't deal-breakers for you, this game might blow you away at times. I forced myself not to use any blueprints until the CV ship level, and I haven't have that much fun building stuff since I was playing with Legos as a kid. Basic requirements are needed for everything. You want to build a hovercraft or a ship? want to be able to turn in all directions? well you need thrusters *facing* all directions. Items put out heat, you need air flow, etc.
-I'm almost 270 hrs game play in, and I will say the expansiveness of the play world is very large for myself and one close regular playing buddy. I have maybe 50+ hrs with the largest tier ship, and I have still have yet to even really scratch the surface.
-Once again, if the above Cons don't bother you: if you have natural mind for engineering, systems, data, etc. this game has been insanely enjoyable for me. 

It's hard to bullet point this game when referring to a friend. It's basically a totally janky piece of trash.... but that I love playing and in some ways has more potential than any game I've played in decades, especially if you get a server and play with a bud or two.

Update: After another 30 hrs of gameplay in what I believe to be the early parts of what they consider late game content, I just feel the level of horrid physics/bug/quality to this ""finished"" product is so bad that I can't in good conscious say this is a well made game, let alone a finished product. 

SPOILER:
Once in a battle ready CV, I went to other galaxies. I glitched through 3/4 enemy crafts I saw. I jumped out into space in my suit, and could literally fly through the highest level enemy craft and just pluck loot from the final chests of each ship.

I'm sad that it let me down this way, but I'm not going to renew the server I had with friends. I'll go back to 7dtd which while still in ""early access"", is actually a polished and amazing product experience.

Gamers who enjoy creating things and those who just want to modify others' creations will enjoy this. It's also great for combat between star ships.

As with most other survival-craft games out there, you can feel the Minecraft influences. They've gone way beyond that here with mobile bases, building bases in space, defending against base attacks, and attacking enemy bases and ships.

The community in Steam Workshop is vibrant and active. There are some brilliant creations available there every player should check out whether you want to create your own stuff or just modify others'. Shout out to all those who publish blueprints - you keep the game fresh.

You can reduce or extend the resource and XP grinds as you prefer before you start, but the defaults are pretty generous. New players will best enjoy the game with Mass and Volume disabled until they learn this games' controls and gameplay concepts. The latest Reforged Eden mod makes the game less generous for hardcore players who want more and different struggles to overcome before maxing out everything.

There are some poor design choices by the devs that may stem from technical limitations. 1) Dropped bags, defeated enemies, and loot boxes from destroyed containers expire way too fast. Usually a few minutes. 2) There's an arbitrary speed limit imposed by the game due to how long it takes to stream in parts of the world while moving. My hope is that the devs can address these problems in future updates.

The addition of story missions and side quests has changed the game from when I started. These are mostly driven by combat on foot, which is an unfortunate choice for a game about building, flying, and fighting in star ships.

All that said, the devs are still making updates after years of the game being available. None of the current gameplay issues are deal breakers for me. I keep coming back. Worth every penny.",1631560890,1631560890,True,14,0,0.669641613960266113,1,True,False,False

(Alpha 9.7.somthing) Took ~30mins to set up dedicated server to only find out you cant host the dedicated server and play the game on the same PC. Took ~30mins setting up the same dedicated server on another PC with default config (just wanted to jump in and play with friend), only to find out if you host dedicated on the same network (aka same router) you need to change the port in the config or change the port in the game. Finally me and my buddy are in, we land next to each other and was like ""what the hell do we do now"" in the past there was like a very short tutorial to get you to use your constructor etc. I was trying to mine some rocks (with the rock mode setting of the survival tool) but nothing seems to happen. Wandered around for about 10 minutes, no ore deposits were found. After that, and after multiple ""what the hell do we do now""s we decided the game is a hell of a lot more boring now, at least in the past, starting fresh, you has a tiny bit of guidance and your tools and UI were a bit more descriptive, don't know what happened to the game now. I honestly don't want to judge with no facts, but after so many years since initial alpha, the game is still in a pretty poor state regarding polish.

I like the fact that you do not have to keep returning to the drop pod for supplies or to process ore. The crafting screen is easily understood, with locks on items you haven't learned to make yet, so you don't sit wondering why you can't build what you want to build. Gaining points to research crafting is easily done, you get XP for literally everything you do, from harvesting plants to eating. This is very real... in life we gain experience in everything we do, so why not in gaming. 
I am still working on navigation... but my driving and steering skills are lacking in most games. This one is not as hard for me as some as far as ground vehicles goes, so that is a bonus for me!
I do not like the nights on the tutorial, but once I got into a real game, not so bad.
I recommend starting a base as soon as possible so you can use armor, that way you do not have to choose between light and weapon, as having to make this choice could cause you to die.
Overall, it is great! I love the graphics and mechanics!
There are only a couple of things I would like to see:
First, sometimes, due to the way the world spawns, sometimes ore and vegetation are in the air.
Second, there is no sharing of missions with the faction or team.... if you have four people running missions together, each one must complete each mission. I believe that there should be a way to share the progress for the faction members participating... if each member of the group has the mission activated, they should get credit for it.

Well, I haven't played in a year, figured I should try out the game again. Here's my orignial review if you're curious: https://pastebin.com/Sj25HhAP

So, the game still has the same warning about low memory. Again, I have 16 GB of RAM. Why is it doing this?

The character models *still* look like shit. You can't just smoth out the face so I don't look like a failed mutant? Really? This isn't a big deal (especially in a first-person game), but it still shows a *massive* lack of polish and attention to detail. Especially for what's supposed to be a full and complete game (and one that costs $20 too!)

My expections aren't gonna be very high if the first thing I see while perusing the settings is some 3rd-rate freebie model off the Unity store. But hey, who knows - maybe the game is good now? (oh and while we're on the subject of models - I'm on the high graphics settings, that's gonna be relevant later)

I also notice that using my other monitors minimizes the game. Bit annoying, but not a huge deal. At least it doesn't crash.

So, I load the tutorial. Might as well criticize that while I'm at it.

Seems like we got some story stuff now, pretty cool. *But* I noticed that all the models around me are just... bad. The pod looks kinda meh, and the trees
 in the distance look like someone ripped of dreamworld's shitty assets, downscaled them, and plopped them into a $20 survival sandbox game.

Movement is so floaty and weird, like what the hell? Why does it feel like I'm gliding around? What? I can get past this if the rest of the game is decent, but so far it really seems bad.

Pausing the game to write down more of this review, and I notice that it's a small, easy to miss bar in the top-left. This is fine if you're in early access, but make a proper UI in your fully released (and once again, $20) game.

Saving makes multiple files (which I've *always* hated, but it also makes a backup. That's pretty nice, haven't seen many other games do that before.

Anyway, back to the tutorial. The objectives are small and in the corner, which is nice but also bad. It should be a bit more obvious, took me a minute to find them. I click F1 like I'm told, and am hit with a fucking *massive* wall of text. Why is this relevant? Why is it not more concise? This is just explaining a standard quest system, I don't need 3 paragraphs dedicated to a breakdown of how a damn quest list works. Like come on.

There's also a bar on the top with more UIs, which is fine. Everything's in one spot, and it seems each one has a shortcut for quicker access. That's good - spreading stuff around too much is annoying.

The tech tree is *still* a mess. Evereything is locked behind a levelling system (because I guess this is an RPG now?) nd not organized very well - tree flowcharts go down for a reason. Don't ever go sideways unless it's a short branch.

I've got to eat some food and put my tools on my hotbar. Bit odd how the hotbar isn't pre-set, but hey Minecraft does this and it works.

While mining rocks, I notice that there's a very tiny info box in the bottom-right. Make it more obvious. Once again, lack of polish. I do learn that there are 3 modes to this survival gun though, which is good. Learning through trying rather than shoving text boxes in my face.

The crafting grid and inventory UI are spaced way too far apart, quite literally opposite of each other. This shows that your UI designer can't be bothered to unify things (other than the big central bar). Having to look across the entire screen to compare resources to my current recipe is just annoying. Yeah it's not terrible, but come on. This is basic UI design - unify things when ya can.

There's also an output and currently crafting queue, which is just....kinda odd? Why not have output go into my inventory, this crafter is already inside of my inventory. The in-progress bar is fine though, Factorio does that and it helps so much.

More tutorial, opening lots of UIs, and having lots of text boxes shoved down my throat. Can't you have someone talk through this, or just make it more concise? Why have a big box saying that the map shows yout things? I know what a fucking map is, no need to go into exhaustive detail about it!

The game now wants me to hike a third of a mile (side note - why miles? Not sure if it's the default, but shouldn't it be kilometers since 99% of the world uses that much better system?) to go to some wreck, but I honestly can't be fucked to do so.

Once again, this game is very disappointing and shity. It's been in early access for probably 2 or 3 years at this point, then got unceremoniously shat out onto Steam, then the devs just kinda stopped caring about any basic level of polish.

Quite disappointed I wasted my money on this years back, as it's still terrible. With a good amount of work though, it could be the next Space Engineers. But as is, it's got almost no polish, everything looks kinda shit on the highest settings, and it's just not fun. There's no animation for mining, you just kinda sit there and watch a health bar go down. Then do that again forever.

The core loop is still the same awful system of waste time mining pointless shit > try to navigate the god awful UIs > rinse and repeat.

I can't speak for the building & ship mechanics, but it seems other reviewers also say it's god awful.

So, in conclusion - *do not buy this game.* It's a terrible mess of unfinished work and smashing multiple unrelated systems into one monstrosity of a failure.

Go buy Space Engineers, Elite: Dangerous, Everspace, or literally any of sci-fi/space game. Hell, go back Star Citizen. A game that probably won't even come out is a better investment than this is.

I do believe the devs could overhaul everything and make the game decent or even good, but it would take a *massive* amount of work to do so. I'll happily go through and re-do this review if it is done though.",1601861173,1631437361,False,3,1,0.498725324869155884,0,True,False,False

I've quit with the lackluster 1.0 release after a long period of lackluster alpha releases before.
Sad but true the most fun in this game was playing around pre-alpha phase.

Today its still a buggy mess with stability issues. You have to decide if its fun or hassle. for me its the latter.

Vanilla is no fun at all for me. So state of the art is the Forged Eden Mod which is kinda mandatory.

In fact, the modders acturally try to come close to the original vision of the game. With the new weapon systems is also way more fun than the vanilla combat in space.

There are still limitations. Its not a shooter and you feel it everywhere. The Bots in Eden move like in quake arena, yay. Which is not as boring as in vanilla. Still, it feels like you play a vamped 90's game.

I blame the lack of dev experience and no red development line for it. We have still a lot of half arsed mechanics and i doubt they will polish Emp. 

Another downside of the Mod is that you have lots of pois with lever puzzles. And some you just can't skip...
And again it's 90's feeling with mission and poi design. Some are better but most are really really wtf?! It hurts to see this stuff in 2021 eg. stuff ranging from fetch quests to i die my way through the poi and aimbot npc's. 

I had endless discussion about it and i'm tired. Ppl argue its hard but for me its just a hassle. Basically the mechanics/the game foundation is not good and modders throw 90's style dps tests at you - yes the devs did that too. KI is still stupid so they had to make aimbots.

It doesn't feel satisfying for me. Playernumbers are also rather low. On the last server i've played 12 peeps on a weekend was very good. 

You still have server wipes or playfield wipes coz stuff is breaking or new bug fixes make things worse. Or they are just not synced with the server mods coz why would one talk to server owners or modders :P

The unlock techtree is still boring and i never liked the unlock system. RPG elements... haven't noticed anything useful tbh. I guess its like many other mechanics a thing on the bucket list without proper implementation into a well designed eco system. Economy... also not really working. Market is barebone and no dynamics or anything.

It still shines as ship designer - like real good looking stuff but it lacks real functionality or variety. Its really just about the look. 

Sad but true since other games also failed to deliver their promises its still one of the best space block builders out there. Nontheless i have no fun with it and i rather go back to X3 for a space opera feeling now and then.

You could spend 3 hours in the games in-game building system and make something that looks better--and the devs haven't even done that. In fact, the entire game feels that way. I have never left a review on steam before, and this game takes the shit-cake in such a massive way that I am now here writing this.

Oh and apparently the whole flying through your entire ship thing is a ""feature"" they plan to ""add in the future"" because you know, working wall physics in a spaceship isn't something they feel is a fucking priority feature in a game about spaceships.

I've watched it evolve from a fairly basic plain sci-fi builder to a fairly well fleshed out one that spans a galaxy. It's got a few issues sure, but the devs work hard on it, and they listen to our feedback and adjust plans or functions.

Pros:

-Great Open world
-Lots of tools to build complex ships and stations
-Beautiful worlds (especially the gas giants)
-Easy to get into and figure out construction
-Very large galaxy to explore
-Pretty good performance
-FPS mechanics are pretty solid
-Vehicle combat can get intense with stations with shields, requiring thought and planning.
-Difficulty can scale a lot to give more intense challenges at creation

Cons:

-A bit hard to get started, especially when you're new.
-Story could be stronger
-Not many places to explore besides structures, there's no caves or underground caverns of uniqueness.
-Lighting isn't room isolated, it can show through walls
-Computers and furniture blocks are largely, but not solely, decorative rather than functional.
-Playing alone can be lonely and a bit rough till you learn the game, best with 2+ people, but that's typical of these games.
-Still can't stand while vehicles are in motion
-Little visible block damage or physics from impacts like you see in Space Engineers.
-No modding tools yet
-Big updates often require you to restart to get some things added to the data pool; i.e. new planets, POI's.

Overall it's my top favourite sandbox game, I highly recommend it, it has some flaws but it has a lot of potential and great existing systems; I look forward to seeing what they continue to add over time. There's a reason I have over 1,700 hours into it after all. ^.^",1630884835,1630884835,True,20,0,0.687874913215637207,0,True,False,False

I say so far...   because I am not even  done with the Base Building tutorial (and just past the return window) when a swarm of drones comes in, destroys my base and proceeds to rinse-and-repeat kill me.  Forever as far as I can tell?

  I thought that the crafting interface on 7DtD (which I ended up loving) was odd, but  Empyrion is a TOTAL mess.   1 base 'Core' block, connected to other blocks that don't seem related, all chained together using a placement system that seems hell-bent on putting blocks in invalid locations.  The tutorial tells you to make things, like a 'Small Generator', but there are two 'Small Generator' blocks, one works and one doesn't.  Same thing with fuel cells.

  Need to craft medicine at the local villages crafting station?  Good luck.  I counted 5 different inventories at play, and NONE of them were mine.  I had to drag items from my inventory into some other inventory, close it, then open the crafting window, which then showed my ingredients, but they were 'locked' for some reason.    I was still able to drag them to the 'Input' box, then create the medicine. Then I had to take it out of the output box, place it in my inventory, then use it.  

They give you a mini-bike, but then they delete it after 20 minutes if you get off of it and walk away.  WHAT?

Empyrion has about the same scope, in a 3D landscape. A galaxy that you can explore in its entirety. Many different types of planets, in different types of star systems, with different factions occupying them. Starting out is difficult but not impossible, depending on which planet you start on the difficulty varies.

But once you get to the part where you get to explore, that's when it becomes unbelievable. This game has got to have the best procedural world generation I've ever seen, and that says a lot. Some of the planets are simply breathtaking. And there's always something to do on them.

Until they fix/revert things like the volume/CPU system, I will refuse to recommend this game to new players, as that would be inconsiderate toward people who are looking for a fun game to play.

This is a fun game that has been absolutely destroyed by updates that aren't even that recent at this point. Not sure what the developers are thinking. The volume system is especially terrible. It adds absolutely nothing fun whatsoever to the game. All it does is create a bunch of tedious barriers to doing almost anything. It forces you to use a clunky and confusing inventory management system that is downright hostile to new players, which is why I can't recommend this game. Sure you can turn it off, and I don't think it's a coincidence that the most popular multiplayer server turns it off. But most multiplayer servers leave it on, making most multiplayer servers horrible to play on. Terrible development priorities. They could be adding content or improving existing content instead of extra chores and tedious barriers to gameplay for the sake of ""realism"". Bro I'm flying around in a magic spaceship built with nonexistent resources shooting at space spiders. I'm playing a game. The point is for it to be fun. Volume isn't fun.

Mass, volume, CPU, thruster blocking etc. have rendered most blueprints in the workshop unusable for minimal balance gains. I understand the reasoning at least when it comes to things like thruster blocking or CPU, though the system is horrifically unintuitive. There is no good excuse for the current volume system though. If the developers fix it, or even better remove it, maybe I will recommend this game again. Until then don't waste your time.

This is probably the most ambitious video game I've ever played.

It's a first person shooter.
It's a flight simulator.
It's an engineering (building) simulator.
It's a role playing game.
It's a trading game.
You can play with as many as 32 of your friends with a multiplayer server.
It has a vast online repository of thousands of ships and buildings in the Workshop.
It allows for the creation of basic mods with only the change of a few text files.

You're probably thinking - I'm in lets start playing!
Well you might want to wait a bit. Although the game developers (Eleon Game Studios) called it ""Released"" in July 2020, it's not. Perhaps they should have had a beta test phase to avoid confusion. There are problems with pathing of NPCs. There are broken missions. The graphics are not well optimized. The various weapons may not have the expected affect. In summary, as of December 2020, Empyrion feels very much unfinished. However, if such concerns do not bother you, you can still have lots of fun playing. The game has a huge following of players and creators to help you get the most out of your experience.

Who might like playing Empyrion?
The game is complex. Really complex. It will be hundreds of hours before you feel competant. There are no strait-forward guides (yet) to explain game mechanics. Much of what you do and build will be trial and error. However, once you have a decent understanding of how things work, you will be able to move about the game with little effort and die much less frequently. Did I mention you will die frequently? If you like a challenge and figuring things out on your own, this game might be for you.
The game can be grinding. You're required to harvest all of what is needed and that can be a huge amount of various materials. For this reason, I recommend playing with wieghts and volumes turned off. In my experience, it can take ten times the effort to gather resources during early game and tends not to be much fun. The purists out there will call me crazy, but I perfer my games to be enjoyable.

I plan to camp out on my starter world and build an empire uncontested!

Well good luck with that, but the game will force you to fight for your place in the galaxy. As soon as you build a base, which you will need to build better things, you start to be attacked by the local Zirax protagonists. Ultimately, you need to defend yourself with bigger and better weapons than your opponents. When you partake in various missions you will quickly find your success dependant on how well armed you are.

I'm creative and I'm going to build a beautiful super ship capable of dominating all around me.

Good for you. Go for it. When you're done put it on the Workshop for all to enjoy. However, I found the game does not really work that way. Most likely, you will start with a supplied starter ship and modify it to perform the next task. Your creations will follow function more than form. Not that you can't have both, but it will probably be late game before you can introduce some nice esthetics to your designs. You can spawn in already created ships from the Workshop, but generally speaking they tend to look better than they perform. Personally, I encourage the player to build for themselves and get to know how the individual parts function together. Then, maybe, you can spawn in a cool looking ship and modify it to your needs.

I played Empyrion Galatic Survivor and aced it! What possible challenge is left to me.

Congratulaions! You've just graduated from pre-shool. Now go to the Workshop and subsribe to the mod called Reforged Eden. Everything is ten times harder. The weapons are more effective, as are your opponents. There is more of everything, except what you need, so it takes much longer to become dominant. Rare items are much more rare. So be prepared to have to discover what is needed. However, the payoff is huge with more advanced tech to help to bend the galaxy to your will. Just be aware, it takes huge amounts of experience points to unlock the best tech. After 500 plus hours of Reforged Eden I am still finding new things to explore and conquer. 

Conclusions

Although I would not consider Empyrion Galactic Survival a finished product, this game is well worth playing. It is by far the most value I have had in video game. It can be a little boring at times but adjust your gameplay accordingly. My perferred style is fighting and looting to get new resources. However, you could easily progress by exploring and harvesting. Once the developers have a completed product, I fully expect the modders out there to bring endless senarios for you to enjoy. Overall I give Empyrion Galactic Survial a 8 out of 10 with the possibility of 10 of 10 when fully completed.

Hopefully, you found this informative, and I look forward to seeing you in-game someday.

Edit:
As I have nearly completed both vanilla and Reforged Eden 1.5 there some thoughts that need expressing about this latest release.
First thing is WOW! Reforged Eden has had a wonderful visual upgrade. It really has been a joy to play.
Having said that there are still some frustration with some things:

Some missions and POIs are way too hard for single player mostly in Reforged Eden, and makes me wonder if there can't be some way to change the spawning behaviour if there is one one player.

You still need to enter ""God Mode"" sometimes to get out of trouble. Like falling off of your ship or POI (point of Interest) while far of the ground. There needs to be a teleporter or respawn to easily put you back in your ship instead of waiting for it to run out fuel and fall to the ground. Generally speaking you should never have to resort to God Mode in the game.

Eleon - You NEED to start fixing long time problems rather than adding cool posters. While adding content is nice, bugs interrupt good game play and significantly detract from an otherwise excellent experience. Please spend some time listening to your community and addressing some issues like the inability to crouch.

There. I said what I needed. I'm off to Decayed Space to get me some Progenitor Technology.

In short: don't buy a totaly broken game.

longer:
The fact that this game at this point was moved out from EA, and called complete tells almost everything about the game and the devs. 
We're talking about a game which is in development since 5 years, still almost nothing works until now. This will need at least another 5 years at this speed until a half way working thing gets released. than it will be 10 years old already.
You have hundreds of star systems with only few types of POIs, which are almost all broken. So you will find the same things over and over everywhere.
Basic AI is not working, fixing AI problems with more enemies, maybe some will move, the rest dont.
Enemies stuck in places, enemies ignoring you just 2m away. (also if u shoot them), sticky trees, you can merge a tree with your ship and can move. While underground minig, you can see out to the sky trought the earth. Player charaters aren't well (or at all) animated. Enemies aren't animated too. 
3rd person view laggy and broken. 1st person view also feels bad.
bug everywhere, yes everywhere. A simple thing like switching between the maps is also non-working. To be honest the list of working things is shorter than the non-working one. (no joke)
there is no real endgame, nether a mid game. only an early game. Which lets you think at first its a good game, but shortly after that you realize that you bought some crap.
Single player feels very empty. Multiplayer is broken as it is. Lag deaths, slow and empty servers. There is no real dedicated server for. and there is no HW on the market which could host about 200 players (which is nothing in such a big galaxy) this means you can except about 1 player in every 5 star system and who knows how many planets. The reality is that you barley find any other players because there is no sever with 200 slots.
There are so many issues that its impossible to list them all. Many other reviews pointed out some, but still there are a lot of issues which where not pointed out yet.

I see that many fanboys here who try to tell us that its a small dev team and so. hmm. I dont care how big a team is? I just care on the result. that i pay 20 eurs for a broken crap. They call it complete, i call it no even alpha. this isn't even ready for EA.
The last update (from alpha 13 to v1.0) was just a youtube video?! and they told us they go on vacation after this hard work. baam in your face.

finaly the fact what we can see from the reviews, just after it was released the positive reviews turned over into a negative. You see in the last few weeks 9 negative from 10.

i would love to play with such a game which is just working as intended, but this isn't the case in empyrion.

And finally the trick of the game devs is, that you should enjoy the first few hours so you cant get a refund anymore, than they don't care anymore about you.

Update 18.08.2021. Exactly one year later ~1700hrs:
Short: Game is getting worse.
Longer: 
- Many of the bugs from last year (almost all) is still not touched. dev team has no interest to fix these game breaking bugs. insted they do cosmetics, like nicer sun flairs and so on.
- Major Game Updates usually breaks save games. Means new start. (Should only happen in EA)
- In most cases you just need to read the changelog and all where they say they fixed it, you can expect different new bugs.
- Game should be still in EA.
- Some Starter planets broken
- Some missions are broken
- UI got slower than in last year
- Many old bugs got back to game like invisible blocks. once you get an invisible block in your structure, you cannot remove, replace. only thing is to build around it and hide it. It gets worse if something like CPU extender gets invisible. Means, you cannot replace it, and does not count into CPU statistics anymore. 
- Merging ships. If you collide in space battle you're lost.
- Invisible enemies. You cant shoot them, bug they can shoot you.
- Signal logic problems, constantly breaking, needs to re-setup, sensors needs to be replaced to get it work again
- Door problems, Doors looks like open from distance, once you get close they jump to close (no animation) and they start right after to open.
- Doors are transparent/invisible from viewing from Space.
- Window reflections shows terrain behind structure
- lot of POIs are outdated

In overall the fact with invisible blocks and invisible enemy ships breaks the game so much, that's not fun anymore. The absolute ignorance what the devs show is unacceptable, but shows clearly that this game wont be finished anytime, and shows also what you can expect from this game in the future.

Let's dissect the sub-genre of sci-fi open-world sandbox survival.

Is it Sci-Fi? Yes. Very sci-fi.

Is it Open-World? Yes. Open Worlds even.

Is it sandbox survival? Well..

Making ships and bases is kind of stupid compared to space engineers. Feels like they spent too much time adding what space engineers didn't and not enough time adding what it did right. Really misses the mark. All the blocks seem like comp graphics class project than polished game items compared to literally any other game in this genre. The vehicle/vehicle/vehicle/base building system is overly complex. Personally things should jsut function based on how you build them, with the exception of static bases, I get the need for the distinction but the rest is just being as we say in new england ""extra and basic at the same time"".

They sell this game as a finished product. Should get flagged for that lie. Seriously should have to pull that down or rollback that claim to early access to stay on the steam store. This is just as unfinished as Cyberpunk on release if not worse, but isn't getting the same publicity. Tons of game features, none of them feel genuinely working. And that cover art is a straightup lie. Nothing that polished anywhere in this game. Most of the blocks are just for show including things you might expect to have function. Such as:

Antennae
Control Panels
Blocks that appear to be used to move objects/fluids/gas/etc.
Plus being able to access all the cargo, controls, and refueling for any ship or base from just looking at any block on it, while bothering to add ""decorative"" control panels feels immersion breaking af, and defeats the point of having any reason to see any blocks. can bury everything vital and just handle it externally.

There are regular updates, but they don't really do much. If you read the list instead of just being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the list of text, its basic stuff that should've been sorted in Beta Testing. How about better blocks? More blocks? Actual details instead of faking it with normal and specular maps? Working water physics? Keeping people's stuff from despawning? Making early combat less OP? Fixing all your survival mechanics? Finishing off your broken quest and progression systems? Write some actual dialog or quests for all the npcs that are really just there for eye candy that isn't that sweet? Wheels? Less arcade flight that actually feels like a challenge and some piloting skill? A reason to make various ship sizes since you made it so clear that so many exist? Making all your basic looking blocks work instead of players seeing (deco) on anything slightly cool looking? Nah, but we fixed that one shader that was annoying us, so... PROGRESS!

The survival mechanics are bi-polar. It is hit or miss what kind of a game you will get when you start single player. Will you burn or freeze to death? Endless radiation? Attacked by NPCs before you get to do anything only to get caught in a recurring deathwave? All of this on the lushest planet that the game tells you to start off on to learn the game.

OP drones early on and a very juvenile-level development story line, with buildings a child with a bucket of legos and no curfew could build better over night.

Lets say you skip past all that, cheat and spawn a ship and head to space. All of those challenges are completely gone and now you feel like a solo bounty hunter, smuggler, pirate, trader, etc... with no effort at all. and nothing to compel you to continue, past the need to explore. No real need to continue any of the brutal game mechanics from your starting world, and no real reason to dig deeper into any of the POIs as they call them.

No reason for PvP either, because it is flat-out better in Space Engineers. You can't launch orbital attacks in this, since the way they made all of it work everything is on separate layers or sandboxes. On Planet > In Orbit around a Planet or Star. There is no sandbox per solar system. It is per planet. And escaping atmosphere and fighting gravity is beyond easy. The lack of pistons, working gravity objects, hinges, rotors and weld blocks and wheels takes a huge chunk of design creativity out of the mix for PvP or even enjoying this as a sandbox and exploration game.

The worlds look breathtaking and the wildlife is a delight. But Just about every game has that and better for the most part. NPCs wouldn't be a selling point at all if this very niche genre didn't always get the short end of the stick. This is yet another publisher who promised the community the game we can all picture in our heads but never get to actually play, while handing over an unfinished, unrefined product that fails to meet those promises or requests by the people who funded it's existence.

I hope this game proves me wrong in the future, but in its current state and with the updates and bugs that have happened this far into its existence, I don't see good things for this game's future.

If you want PvP, get Space Engineers. If you want to explore, No Man's Sky is absolutely playable these days and a much better experience. If you just like base building and Automation with some eye-candy, Satisfactory all the way. Osiris is too early on and so is Starbase for me to hold out hope with this genre, but I'll patiently wait and hope for the best.",1629202723,1629202723,False,73,9,0.594328165054321289,18,True,False,False

I just hope the updates will not break my saves as it happened during Early Access.
But still compared to other indie games, this one achieved a lot more and deserves a thumb up.

I was afraid to play it more after ""release"", because developers told me that they do not intend to keep saves compatible.

and the review ends with ""From a quality and completed perspective though, it does not come close to Space Engineers, X3, and No Man’s Sky"".

Conclusion:
When developers removed the Early Access, they said the game is not finished. I accepted that. But a game which left Early Access cannot be defended by fans with the traditional ""you do not know what Early Access means"".
Developer's excuse to leave Early Access was illogical.
They said they wanted to do it as a 5 year anniversary since they are on Steam.
They also said the update rates will slow down.

I recommend the game to be purchased by single players when it ends up being updated.

- There's search function for the Constructors but for arbitrary reason it doesn't search all the different type tabs, essentially making the search function near useless
- There is no search function for the storage boxes. Clearly it was possible to do for Constructors but apparently not for storages
- Ship max speed in space is determined by the thrust per axis of thrusters which makes no sense. If the ship has 10 thrusters for forward thrust, it's maximum speed is higher than the 1 reverse thruster when it should be acceleration related, not max speed. 
- If your ship generators are damaged, the ship somehow stops on it's own in space. Presumably this is to allow salvaging the broken ship later and not have it drift endlessly in space but it also means you can't drift the ship back to a planet or station if you had set the course during battle. 
- The beginning part of the game is unnecessarily difficult and forces you to use Factory Blueprints or very carefully planned build order for the base which no new player can figure out in first playthroughs. Power up a base with barely a roof and some random drones decide to assault you for the sheer sin of existing. 
- No setting to align minimap to North
- Food spoils in stacks
- Different sizes and types for Small Vessel, Hover Vessel, Capital and Base are difficult to discern at a glance and are sometimes inconsistent. Hover Vessel has specific Docking Pad for docking but the equivalent for Small Vessel is not Docking Pad, it's an alternate part for Landing Gears.

The we learned some basics; get your base running, research some tech, figure out storage and logistics...
While building our first vessel and spending hours on the design and functionality something clicked and we got so immersed we didn't realize we played 9 hours straight.

This game is absolutely amazing and one of the most immersive experiences in my life. Explore the planet's different biomes, map the territory, scavenge wreckages, mine the planet's resources, build a hover to zip around faster. Not enough? Build a vessel, fly to outer space, land on the planet's moon and mine its resources while Zirax drones occasionally attack you. Not enough? Build a capital vessel, install a warp drive and fly to other planets and moons in the solar system, all with their unique beautiful biomes, resources, factions and dangers. Not enough?

TL;DR: It's just not that good. Below average at best, with mods being a practical necessity in order to tolerate the game.


Things I liked:
- The mods (Is this REALLY something the developers had a hand in though?)
- Variety of things to do
- Exploration value
- Enemy structure variety
- raiding bases is surprisingly fun
- Building is kind of fun, though CPU system is obnoxious (but hey, you can turn it off so.. fair enough. )

Things I disliked:
- Hitscan enemy AI. There is no ""strategy"", you're just cheesing the AI.
- Game can be incredibly slow paced if you happen to start in a bad spot which is not fun at all.
- Enemy AI is very basic and bland in-general to be quite honest.
- Building system can be rather wonky and has horrendous controls.
- Game is technically out of early access yet screams early access with every fiber of it's being.

Things I absolutely hate(d):
- The entire game is a janky mess to the point of absurdity. The jank is so horrendous that it transcends the actual game and even infects some functions that it should not infect (great example: it takes literal minutes of stuttering to delete a single save file. What the hell is going on here? )

- Game has some charm to it but the lack of proper AI is seriously holding it back from being something actually impressive.

- Enemy bases, or POI's, have aimbot defensive turrets with 0 weapon spread to one-two tap player vehicles. Whoever decided this was a good idea does not know what they are doing and should be fired, they clearly don't understand game design or just don't play their own game.

- The blatantly purchased/free unity or other 3d assets are very obvious when they come up - and they come up a lot.

- Entire game's combat system is summarized to: Cheese the enemy AI. Great.

- Performance is terrible. Just like it was many years ago when I originally purchased. 

- Developers are known pieces of trash who censor their own forums/discords, AND will gladly ban you from playing the game's multiplayer if you bring up problems in said discord/forums. Keeping in mind that some of these issues have been going on for years - which I can confirm since I have been trying to just play the damn game for years.



In summary - a terrible experience where mods aren't just recommended - they are required. If steam actually did their job correctly, this ""game"" would've been deleted from the steam store the moment it attempted to unironically launch out of early access in the pathetic state that it is in.",1498072339,1628447169,False,1,0,0.490709245204925537,0,True,False,False

As most players will spend a maximum of 20 before moving on to the next game, this should be enough as an incentive. If you belong to that niche of players who invest hundreds of hours in a game, read on.

Empyrion is not a game without flaws, but the development team never stops improving it. The creative part is extraordinary, although I must admit that, considering the incredible amount of objects available in the workshop, there is no strictly required to express any creative talent unlike other titles.

The SP campaign basically runs on 3 nodes. In fact, you will first have to learn to survive on the planet you crashed into. Recovering sufficient materials to leave orbit and begin to become familiar with the experience of planetary life and survival in space concludes the first part.
Interspace travel, threat investigation, and gathering the materials needed to improve your threat level is the core of the game. This will lead you to land on even very different planets, which will test your ability to adapt.
The campaign ends when you are faced with the real intergalactic threat. Testing all your warfare capabilities.

The AI ​​of the game during the fights, at times manages to be relentless, while at times it is a little slow. But on this point it is important to say that many efforts have been made and are still being made to be able to improve it. Especially with regard to peaceful interaction.

Of course there are similar products that focus their attention on different aspects. But at the moment, Empyrion represents (from my point of view), the best single-player first-person creative space survival experience available on the market. It is certainly a fundamental starting point for any SH that will want to propose something similar in the future.",1628429873,1628429873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have to put a thumbs down until they can get it running better on my setup...Empyrion was a great running stable game on my system for a while..

Preamble...

At $20 if you can deal with its clunky menu and some funky mechanics, it is not a bad game.  An example of clunk mechanics, Drill Turrets should be available for all Vessels, especially Hover Vessels.  Constantly getting Stuck on Trees needs to be really addressed.  Not having a harvestor turrent that can both drill and harvest trees is needed. There are some gamepaly mechanics in this game even with its released version that are need of dire rework.  If you want less creativeity but a more further developed creative open space co-op survival game I recommend No Mans Sky.   Though I will still recommend Empyrion, if you can get past some of its cumbersome gameplay mechanics, as Empyrion has a lot of creative freedoms and survival aspects.

Survival Aspects
This is a survival sandbox solar system game.  You start on a escape pod, falling on the planet with basic tools.  You then are tasked with keeping up with eating and curing cuts and bruises.  Some cuts have bacteria and parasites and the player needs to make medicine to combat that.  There is also different planet types with different environment properties that the player must be prepared for (EH, Falling fireballs on a molten planet)

Sandbox Aspects
The player also builds his own base and can use tools to dig into the ground.  Their are 3 vehicles types that the player can craft, Hover vehicle (HV), small spacecraft (SV) and capital spacecraft (CV).  If your curious what the player can create I recommend going on to the workshop to see examples.  Each type of vehicle (including spacecraft) has certain blocks it can only use, to make them different from each other.  The water simulation is very basic and is static.  Water does not flow into places it would normally go into if it had the avenue to do so.    Physics simulation is very basic but can configured to do more (Weight calculations to get into space).  IT is enough to be interesting but not overwhelming.  There is a planetwide and system wide trading between player factions and players themselves.

UI and other stuff
There are three major factions in the game and one of them starts out as hostile.  You can also make your own faction and set rules on bases, so that only certain players (non-faction) can access certain areas.  The UI is good and the navigation between menus is done well.  Once you have the resources the game automatically makes all the previous parts to complete the entire object, weapon, ammunition or tool.  Weapons are basic and offer no way to adjust sections of the weapons (Reciever, barrel, stock, sights etc).
The player can also customize his own solar system, with hostile spacecraft, bases (including space stations) and hover vehicles.

Graphics
Running on a 5700 xt red devil, AMD RYZEN 9 3900X the game looks good.  The explosions are basic Weapon models are good but not stunning.  Weapon graphics look average, but not amazing.

AI
Ai is pretty basic.   They do not run to cover use flanking tactics or lean out to shoot around a obstacle.  They will try to take over your base and destroy part of the walls to get to the core of the base (destroy the core, all base functions are removed).  They will stand in a open area and run directly to you to shoot at you within effective range.

What type of player would be interesting in this game?
Wants to play survival game with others and likes the sci-fi aspects of it. 
Wants to create their own solar system with their own creations too.  
Likes the aspects of sandbox survival and has a lot of options to create their own bases and everything else

If your looking for the next AI super intelligent challenge with amazing explosions and fast paced shooting, simple short term fun, the player will have a tough time getting into this.  This game offers far more for the player if time is invested into it, than a lot more games out there at empyrion's price point ($20 USD).",1574537979,1628207598,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The shaders on the blocks you build with have really improved, but the terrain and foliage just still look super low poly. And the planets as viewed from space just don't look realistic. Devs, I believe this is made in Unity, so the Space Graphics Toolkit can give some inspiration on good planet rendering from space (the Unreal marketplace has a Space Creator asset that can give some visual inspiration too). The star map seems vast, but I wish it was more of a galaxy map so you had some sense of where you are in the grand scheme of things, because when it's just a big cubic region of space with stars all over, it doesn't really feel motivating to reach for an end goal or anything.

Old: When you're down on the planet surface, this game can be kind of fun. Although when I played, the enemy bases were always impossible to beat, no matter how tough my ship was, which felt really imbalanced and super annoying. I'm not sure if they've changed that since though... Anyway, When you're in space, the planets really don't look very good. It seems like they could really work on their space art and the shaders they use on planets, moons, ships, and stations to help sell the ""space"" feeling. What I found odd was that aside from setting up turrets to fight off drones, there really was no reason to build a base. In fact, all I did was build a platform with my generator, turret, fabricator and lockers on it, and from there I was able to go out and do whatever I wanted. Walls and a roof didn't matter at all for survival - no weather, no sleeping, no creatures that could come in and get you, etc. I do like the in-game ability to download ships that others have made though.

At this time I like Planet Nomads a lot better than Empyrion, but I do want to support this game in the hopes it continues to get better because I remember enjoying it and would like to see more from it.",1519204384,1628110665,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spoiler: It is not.

While there are many things to do and explore, the game at it's core is at a stage where you would assume the alpha stage to be. 

To list some of them:
-No volumetric light. This means, no matter if you are in the deepest cellar or cave, if it is night, the strongest light fixtures do very little, whereas during the day they burn out your eyes.
-The number one way to lose your ship is it hovering above the ground out of reach. be it, because you accidentally exited too high above on one of the poles (the devs recommend cheats or savefile edits here) or because your cockpit got blown out- which throws you out, whereas the ship stays static in the air, being finished off by whatever attacked you. It also doesn't matter if you remotely remove all fuel. It'll just stay up there without fuel.
-the blueprint system is gamebreaking. if you create your ships or bases in creative mode, you can create them out of thin air by shoving resources into an interface. not on a console, not on some sort of actual factory- no, just an interface, and out pops whatever you want after a while.
-linux server support- something they promised since the beginning- not even remotely in sight after the release.
-there are story components- but do you know how it looks when they just added placeholder un-voiced textfiles in an early stage of developement? thats what you get.
-activating Jet-Packs in space stations with gravity work indefinitely and these ""difficult"" space vessel exploration encounters are a joke. You can just hover over close range creatures without penalty and shotgun them while they can't do anything.
-a ton of stars to travel- but absolutely no reason to go there, you can reach endgame in your current solar system as all resources are available there one way or another.
-if you turn off your jetpack in space- you fall down. No, not towards the planet. Apparently there is a down and thats where you go, have fun.
-a base resource -titan- is almost entirely missing in your solar system. You scrape it together, even though you need it for almost everything. The ridiculous part: the game supports disassembling and you can get tons of metal plates out of scrapping derelict ships- but these are exempt from disassembly. So no Titanium rods for you. The whole gameplay revolves around titan due to it's extreme scarcity, even though it treats other resources as much more important
-park your ship in a trade station- a drone might shoot out the cabin, trapping you in the station forever.

I could go on, but it is apparent some very basic concepts are missing which just feel like early dev stage. all we can hope is they use the money made with the release to hire those missing key people to polish the game.

Now the ""1.0"" release. 
There is no real reason why this should be the finished product except for ""well at some point we gotta say it's released right"" oh wow. No new content arrived with the release, no, you get exactly that trainwreck of great intentions which I just described.

I think it is the classic case with a small indie dev team where each has their focus, but there is no person dedicated to quality control, looking at it as a whole. So you got lots of very cool concepts- while gameplay itself feels like beta-testing.

The atmosphere of the community itself is toxic to say the least. If you dare to anger the devs by neutrally bringing up bugs, there is a good chance you'll be banned and blacklisted on every medium, even their official gameservers.

To be fair, there is a few pluses.
+The world is more alive than in similar games, like Space Engineers. So the things you build also have a purpose.
+The concept at its base can be fun. Base raiding, building a base or vehicles/spaceships
+Structures to explore can be interesting and challenging

I'll have a look again at this in a year or two and revise this review accordingly. The ray of hope is there still is regular patches to the game, so it might be somewhat of a NMS experience, something that needs a year or two to finally become a pretty decent game.

But I have raged quited because the zirax are very OP and we have lost our back packs before because they are so powerful. Maybe we weren't the best at the game but they are tough. We laugh about it now but at the time I would not be giving a positive review! One story happened when we were raiding a zirax colony. (I don't think you can destroy it now its a different model now was a tall building). And we were killing some of their troops and the whole building just collapsed! We died and re spawned and it took us ages to get our back packs and then this happened I was one my way back saying how frustrating that was and my motor bike hit a slope and i was sent into space and i died of hypothermia and lost my back pack in space and i rage quited because it was so frustrating. From now on we have it so when we died we don't have to pick up our back packs over and over again.

Maybe that's been lazying in your opinion but for and my friend this makes the game more enjoyable. This bug is a recent one. So when me and my friends were playing i notice that our SV (small Vessel) was much bigger and we were very small i think that the ship grew and we shrunk. And i turned the power on and it started turning and gliding through the air  I was unable to stop it. The only really negative thing I have is when I sent the bug to the devs about the motor bike they never got back and it has happened before but not as bad (the bug). Also the portable heaters aren't very effective. This i think is quite strange: I was on a desert planet and I was getting hot so I drank three bottles of water and got hypothermia? That doesn't really make much sense. Also spiders and abominations feel less weak now. Not sure if that's a setting or something else. The alien facilities are really creepy though which is really good for the game! The green cannon guns and the red guns (tower guns) are really OP!

In the beginning the game was all about survival and it had some great elements of a survival game. The player starts with nothing, and had to find food and shelter pretty quick to survive the deadly predators and the radiation storms. Next they'd build a motorcycle to get around a bit faster and start to find ore deposits. It took forever to dig out the ore with the survival tool, but it felt balanced. It was unlikely the player had been able to get a real weapon, so they were limited to the survival tool’s limited weapon abilities. While mining the player had to worry about spiders or something following them into the ore cave and attacking them. At the same time the player had to scavenge for food, and might begin a farm so they'd have steady supply of food to eat. Eventually they'd get enough resources to build a hover vehicle - and the first time I started whipping around the planet in one of those, it felt amazing. You could bounce off hills to go soaring through the world. There were “bugs” that felt real. If the player wasn’t careful they could flip over and might have to take the motorcycle to go get a thruster to put on the hover vehicle’s side to give it enough torque to flip back over. You could also find yourself under water, and moving an inch at a time to the closest shore, which took forever but realistic. 
And finally with a hover vehicle the player could get to the other factions. At that time there was no galaxy, and only 3 or 4 factions. Each faction had territory on the initial planet. When the player found a faction they wouldn’t immediately trust the player and trade with them because they simply didn't trust the player yet. The player would have to kill predators in their territory or kill the faction’s enemies and gave a reputation with them. Eventually the player’s reputation rose and they were finally able to trade. Once of the most important items to buy was ammo for a multitool. The ammo was too expensive to make which made this a milestone moment in the game. The multitool allowed the player to finally retrieve blocks, allowing you to salvage crashed capital ships and other POIs of abandoned buildings, etc. 
Finding and building fuel was a challenge, which made the player appreciate the low fuel consuming hover vehicle. After many hours of playing, the player would get to build a small ship and head into orbit. There wasn't much up there, but it was exciting to go anyways, another milestone. The next step was to create a warpable vehicle. I can't remember when the small ships gained the ability, but I'm pretty sure it was only capital ships in the beginning. The cost to build the blocks for the ship was high, making the player salvage crashed ships around the planet to get the blocks to build their first beautiful capital ship. Might not be much of a ship, but it would get into orbit, and warp to the other planets in the solar system. At that time warp lines were static. You couldn't just warp to any planet in range. You had to follow the path, which made sense in some ways. If the planet was on the other side of the sun, you couldn't warp to it. The other planets didn't have much on them back then, but they did have rare resources that were needed to improve vehicles, adding shields, etc. 
All and all, going from a player that was scavenging for food and shelter, to a player flying around the solar system was a great feeling, and made a great game.

That was in the beginning. The game has had many updates since then and has suffered badly from feature creep. 
On August 5th, 2020 the game left early access. The tag “early access” allowed the many bugs in the game to be explained away as the game was not “released” yet. But upon release the game was still littered with bugs, and lacked the polish of a finished game. Almost a year later there are still major bugs in the game. Ships that collide, don’t take or cause any damage, and sometimes become “merged”. NPCs that fall when there is no gravitational field.  Or invisible barriers preventing the player from moving or salvage parts of a ship that has not completely stopped moving.
The game has a forum for submitting bugs, and I have submitted a couple dozen bugs. Some of the bugs I submitted that were clearly bugs but were being categorized as not a bug for reasons that didn’t actually make sense (like indicating there is a workaround or the bug wasn’t important enough). This is the sign of an overwhelmed team and an unpolished game suffering from numerous bugs.
But it is not all bad. A galaxy was added which was exciting and well done in my opinion. Players could now warp to any planet or system within a 30 LY range. But this is also when the game lost its survival feeling. It became very easy for a new player to get into a capital ship and start warping around the galaxy within a few hours of playing. Food could be bought from vendors at cheap prices, removing any need to farm. Ores could be bought from other traders, removing any need to mine. Salvaged weapons and armor could be sold for a disproportionately high amount of money, making it easy to survive. Although the motorcycle is still in the game, it is never used (might still be in the tutorial but that’s about it). Fuel became very cheap to buy from trading stations, allowing players to use their capital ship for all ventures, and making hover vehicle obsolete. Repairing ships became too easy – by saving a template of a completed ship, the player could take there almost completely destroyed vehicle to a trading station, get a cheap price, and instantly repair the ship back to new. For example, an almost completely destroyed capital ship could be completely repaired for less than selling one suit of heavy armour. The original survival aspect of the game and the importance of the original features became obsolete. 
In the original game, everything could be mined, retrieved, destroyed, etc. Enemy based could be captured and raided. It was an “I can do anything in here” game. As the updates came, more and more things broke that feeling. Asteroids were added. Some can be mined, but the majority (99%) can’t be mined, destroyed, or used in any way. NPCs were added that do nothing and the player can’t interact with. Space stations were being built with common blocks that can’t be damaged, captured, or destroyed, even by the strongest weapons. The game has lost a lot of the original “I can do anything in here” feeling.
Features were also being added that didn’t make sense, like satellites that are only found orbiting the star of the system. A new Data Hoarder trader was created, where you could sell the hacked data from these satellites.  But you can’t get or hack data from any other bases, ships, or NPCs, making it feel very incomplete. Similarly trading goods were added, but the game lacks an economical engine to change the prices based on supply and demand, making the trading system very simple.
So where does the game stand today? It was a beautiful survival game, well designed and had a clear objective. It has suffered badly from feature creep and bugs that should have been addressed before moving from “Early Access”. When playing, the game has a hollow feeling, like the game has lost its purpose and soul. It feels like a game that grasped for the stars and barely reached the moon.
The competition for this game would be a mix of Space Engineers, X3, and No Man’s Sky. From a quality and completed perspective though, it does not come close to any of these games. It is hopeful that the Empyrion team finds their focus again and is able to bring soul back to the game.
I've marked this not recommended only as there is no option for “its ok, but it's not what is was""

[h1] Why play Empyrion? Aren't there plenty of space exploration games out there? Space Engineers? No Man's Sky? Elite Dangerous? The perpetually-developed Star Citizen? [/h1]

Empyrion is a versatile game with many different facets of gameplay, offering more gameplay than any of the above standalone games.

[h1] In no particular order, here are the key features that make this game stand out: [/h1]
1. Base building
2. Ship building
3. Planet/space/galaxy travel
4. Gunplay on planets and in space
5. Diverse factions to trade/war with
6. Lively Steam Workshop (mods)
7. Spanj (learn how to play!)

When you look at the list above, you will notice that none of the space games in the header have ALL of these features packed into one game, and THAT is what makes this game stand out for me and my friends.

[b] 1. Base Building [/b]

You can create a base block-by-block and make it as large as you desire (depends on your game settings). You will also have to power the base with fuel and install defenses with ammunition to keep the base safe. Depending on where you settle, you may need to make the base airtight to fill the base with oxygen to breathe. You can make your base on any planet or moon, but beware making your base on a planet that is under the surveillance of an enemy faction. They may send a force to assault your base!

[b] Can I make a space station? A base in space? [/b]
Absolutely. Your space station would also be mobile and function as a place to dock all of your space ships.


[b] 2. Ship Building [/b]

Just like bases, build your ships block-by-block, as big as you want (depending on your game settings).

[b] There are 3 different types of ships: [/b]
-Hover vessels: A hovercraft for quick ground-based travel on planets and moons.
-Small vessels: A ship designed for travel within a single solar system. Capable of storing hover vessels on board.
-Capital vessels: A large-scale ship designed to explore the galaxy. Capable of storing hover vessels, small vessels, and capital vessels on board.

All of the ship types listed above can be outfitted with weapons, if desired.

You can land all of your small ships in the hangar of your capital ship and warp from one star to the next.


[b] 3. Planet/space/galaxy travel [/b]

You can pilot your ship, leave the planet surface and enter open space to explore moons or mine asteroids for vital resources. Outfit your ship with a warp drive to jump to other planets in the solar system. If your capital ship is outfitted with a warp drive, you will be able to jump to entirely new solar systems, potentially controlled by enemy factions, with bases and ships scattered through open space.

Fuel your warp drive with 'pentaxid' to jump through space. Be sure to stay stocked on pentaxid. You don't want to find yourself stranded in space without warp fuel. The same can be said for regular ship fuel. Without fuel, your ship will power down and you will be in trouble.


[b] 4. Gunplay on planets and in space [/b]

Factions will often have outposts/bases on planets sprinkled throughout the galaxy. Some factions are friendlier than others, and you can trade with them or war with them. Your actions will affect your reputation with the factions.

Fight back against the wicked Zirax Empire with a variety of weapons: pistols, assault rifles, snipers, miniguns, rocket launchers, laser rifles, and explosives all available to be unlocked and used in ground combat when invading enemy bases or defending your own.

Outfit your ships and bases with automated turrets to repel enemy forces: projectile turrets, rocket turrets, laser turrets, and more.

Equip your bases and ships with shield generators to absorb incoming damage


[b] 5. Diverse factions to trade/war with [/b]

Interact with a variety of factions: (here are a few with simple descriptions)
-Zirax Empire: Angry aliens that just want to destroy everything
-Talon: Galactic Treehuggers
-Polaris: Massive corporation run by space Jeff Bezos.
-Traders: they trade
-Legacy: Ancient abominations


[b] 6. Lively Steam Workshop (mods) [/b]

The workshop has all sorts of blueprints for ships and bases made by other players! Players have even made their own scenarios to play through and experience the game differently.


[b] 7. Spanj (learn how to play!) [/b]

A fantastic youtuber by the name of Spanj has a great selection of playlists that follow this game through years of development. You can learn how to start the game properly if you find yourself overwhelmed in the beginning. Spanj's video will certainly help anyone who is looking to learn the ins and outs of the game to get the most out of your experience.

I cannot recommend Spanj enough.


[h1] The game has its problems, like all games do... [/h1]

I'm not going to say that Empyrion is perfect, but this game has a little bit of everything. 

The game has simple graphics and animations, but there are still many moments that you can take in the beauty that the game has to offer.

There isn't even a control option to crouch your character, but I have managed to get past it.

The UI will take some time to learn and navigate, and you may even find yourself scratching your head at some bugs.

[h1] With the price tag and the content available, I highly recommend this game, especially if it is on sale. [/h1]",1626730638,1626797938,True,1,0,0.501088559627532959,0,True,False,False

i came in around Alpha 6 not knowing anything about this game ...
my first day in this game at that time was mind blowing ...i was addicted !
the struggle to stay alive was real.learning how to build anything i could move,fly, or live in was the biggest challenge in any creative game ive ever played ! but i found it fun..


between alpha 6 to 8 was night and day the changes kept coming and all for the good ...the community was happy. you wouldnt have hardly found any complaint ..
even if you go back in the reveiws from that time you wont hardly find any legit complaints.
only thing the game needed was ""content"" ....something to do when you built all you can build ...the same thing 90% of the survival games are missing as usual.

then weight limits and cpu hit ...currently there are 1800 servers and only about 7 of them have more than 10 players in them and less than 3 have more than 30-40 ..i have alot of hours in this game designing galaxies and running servers for every hour i have in this game... of the 2700 hours (at the time of this posting) ...i had built over 240 workshop blueprints ...and now they are all worthless because of the new implimentation..
personally its a good game with limitations ... but coming from what it was to what it is now id have to give it a thumbs down ....

Voxel deformation with mining and placement tools, grid-based ship and base building, multiple Ai Factions. One-way AI Zone-Of-Influences that shrink if you destroy their bases. Resource collection. 2-tier Crafting w/ automated sub-assembly.  
Survival with hunger, Ambient and Technology temperature and radiation hazards, auto-turrent-based ship combat, handheld weapon combat, PVE against wildlife, and AIs, PVP(optional). Blueprint storage and fabrication. Disconnected and connected text-based story missions and scripted interactions.
Hazard, Combat, food, and thirst based status conditions 
Strictly enforced grid types (hover, small ship, capital ship, base) with separate tech trees and limited component cross-over. 
Can fly between planets and the space outside of planets. Can warp between planets/moons/POIs in the system view, or between systems in the galactic view.
Can save waypoints in world map, system map, or galactic map
All gravity-based  celestial bodies (Planets and moons) are limited to three sizes.
Can paint textures and colors to cubic sides of each block. 
med quality lighting, textures, character models.  ReShade helps a bit. The space skybox is pretty cool.
Most non-earth-like planet textures are unrealistic.

Technical issues:
GM tools are janky. Character Navigation in space is limited or maybe just inconsistent especially when chasing down or trying to enter a vehicle in space. The character motion and look is limited so in some cases the ship moves above you and you can't keep looking at it without spinning around horizontally.
Mouse-based motion is awkward and is works differently when you switch to third-person. This is true for characters and ships.
The game seems to enforces a downward plane in space despite allowing 3D motion of ships. This limits your viewing rotations, and makes it much harder to align the player with with a vehicle or base grid in space.
Ship physics seem to watch for center of mass torque and weight-thrust characteristics, but the actual implementation this seems generally unpredictable.
Though you require velocity toward your warp destination, you always end up facing the direction that you came FROM?...so you have to manually turn the whole ship around to actually see where you are.
You cannot capture AI ships, even if you replace their core with one of yours (thus gaining ownership). They can only be disassembled for parts. AI's can hack your bases too. The range from which they can achieve this is quite unreasonable.

When turning off the jetpack in artificial gravity field, the character moves to the floor and then slowly tilts toward the standing orientation but never seems to get there until repeated jetpack alignments and randomly strafing around until the character is finally standing. character motion animations are fairly static.   
Cannot crouch?

No true mod support....so no QOL mods or player-based bug fixes. No custom skyboxes. Developer enforces proprietary code encryption and legal threats for the majority of game assets.   
Occasional crashes (sometimes with game stop, sometimes with continued gameplay). 
Console always seems to list warnings or errors right after starting or reloading a map. 
In some scenarios there is no way to disable hazards like ""hunger"" despite setting food to ""OFF"" - so you die every 5-10 minutes. at least you can decide to respawn 100 feet away (just like IRL, lol). 
Status conditions override game settings so you can die of starvation because you are freezing. Many conditions are persistent and will eventually kill you if left untreated...though the game will usually say you died of something else. 

Game seems to have territory claim blocks and offline protection options, but they have to be manually set up and have no effect on single-player. Multiplayer maps have limited player slots, despite technically having thousands of worlds to visit.

Strict instancing of each plant, moon, and the ""sector"" space between them. Does not seem possible to travel between worlds with conventional engines. Warp is required to ""load"" the target instance. At the boundary between sky and space, there is a sudden shift in character orientation, and the planet scale changes to an approximate texture representation of the planet. Gravity suddenly drops off too.  Very little in the way of engineering mechanics, no dynamic grids pistons, hinges, or rotors. Just predefined objects like doors, and retractable tools. Ship designs are mostly focused on design aesthetics, simple sensor triggers, with a small minor attention to the hazardous components that are only dangerous up to a block or two away, and which have no ambient affect beyond that (you can't use the 400C thruster to heat the whole ship). Thrusters don't even need to be outside the ship, thrust plume won't cause damage to players or objects.",1624590493,1626633796,False,3,0,0.505247354507446289,0,True,False,False

I created a tiny mound of a base with a single turret; 3000 minutes later I'm trolling my local system in a custom capital vessel designed by a voxel artist who uploaded the blueprint to the workshop.  I dig (literally) the prospect of gathering a specific list of  metals and stone in order to make a flying, killing masterpiece.

2000 minutes later, I'm finished customizing the vessel I've chosen and I'm ready to explore the galaxy outside my home system.

Sometimes i even felt like i was playing Deus Ex. The first one. Could have been a compliment a few years back, for a game that went out in 2020, not so much. 
The save system is based around server based; so everything is always saved on your actual save. You can create copies of course, but if you die and want to load as in any solo game is what you have to do : Exit-> resume on main menu -> load the penultimate save -> save again when loaded. Since the game will launch at you ridiculous amount of ennemies (50+) in structures and since most ennemies will 2-shot you, well, that means a lot of that manipulation to the point i finally gave up.
I compared it to space engineers because they are related in the construction of base/ships and mining. But the comparison stops here; it's really an arcade quicker version of space engineers; a single repository of any ressource, dug in 20 secs is enough for a base (medium sized). Sure there is 4-5 different ressource needed, but it's really a ""build that to have a respawn and go do some shitty FPS"". Sure T3-T4 ships/freighters will need ridiculous amount of stuff, because they are created automatically by an magical factory that will make you spawn the completed stuff anywhere you want; but you could make them by hand for waaay cheaper.
The AI of ennemies is almost non existent. ""They see you"" -> ""shoot at you"". ""You hide yourself without behing in Line of Sight""-> ""you don't exist anymore"". ""You kill their pal in front of them"" -> ""no reaction"". Best being ""you are in cover in front of an half cube that is a trigger collider""->""you don't exist and can shoot at them without them doing anything"".
Behaviors of ennemy ships are also really bad.
For the base construction, well, you have a limit for each structure, and regular blocks eats a lot of that limit. So mostly if you want to optimize it, the less wall the better. Basically turrets everywhere holding magic to a little block. And also solar power is really neglected because if you aren't on a planet, the solar panels seems to not work. So if you have a teleport on your base that is powered by solar structure, well, it's a one way trip, because you won't be able to come back, even if the production of your 50+ solar panels (15 max by default, but can be modified in a configuration file) is way enough for ensuring that your batteries will have enough juice to power up your base 24/24, when you come back from space, your base has shut down and all batteries are empty, hence if you try to teleport to it from out of space, it won't work since the teleporter will be desactivated.

Pros : This game does a lot of things. The loading times are super efficients (with those models, the contrary would have been weird though). There might be fun to have if you are playing in multiplayer, but even if i have high doubts, i didn't tried so i can't really say shit about it. 
The universe is big/huge and full of things to explore. That's the only redeeming point in my eyes, but it's a big one so...

And even if the list of cons could be really longer if i put more time to write this, i still don't want to put a bad evaluation on this game, even if it was a bad experience, the generated universe and environments permitted a good and varied exploration. But that's really it. Beyond that everything feels clunky and not like a finished product. 

And also because if that exact game would have existed 15-20 years ago, it would have been my favorite, since most of the things in it would have been on par with what existed then, while mixing a lot of elements that, at that time weren't a thing but that could have been. So i should not recommend it. And yet i recommended it.",1626185873,1626185873,True,1,0,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,False

I'm obviously not going to say this is an awful game after 3000 hours immersed in worlds and a universe which is ever different and challenging. No, this is for me the PERFECT game. I have played eve online, no mans sky, subnautica, and after a while would get bored and move on. I wanted a space/survival/exploration/shooter game which was intuitive, challenging yet fun, filled with variety and something else. That something else is EMPYRION. it is early access but feels like a finished game. there are regular updates and developments which have only improved gameplay and opened up even more to do. everything is moddable. everything is destructable. everything is totally awesome.
multiplayer or solo this is the most fun and longest game i have ever played and i'm still exploring local star systems, i hear from other players there are alien races and wars out there...waiting to be discovered.
the player base is friendly and helpful. the enemies are scary and need obliterating. I have tanks, mobile artillery, tree cutters, flame throwers, fortified bases, fighter craft, scout and exploration craft, and the mother of all starships. i even have a little space station who's crew i killed cos i forgot to top up their oxygen supplies while away exploring a lava spitting planet. oops.
and i make pizza, i love the pizza.
Play online with others on private or public servers. build and design your own stuff and publish it for others to build. play solo. join factions or just kill everything that moves.
there are story missions which open up a universe of lore and mystery, or ignore all and just do your own thing or even better, do a bit of both.
the scope of this game just gets better with each update. this has been made by true sci-fi fans for sci-fi fans and the developers actively update and post development plans and direction.
finally....it even has dinosaurs and pirates. How f'ing cool is that?
work in progress and already scoring a 10/10 from me.
4000 hours played soon and not once did i get bored!
so....this game is recommended!

This is one of the only indy devs I've come across in the survival genre that are actively and constantly improving the game, making huge strides forward and not taking steps backward. (As far as I've seen.) 

Things to know:
-The Universe is MASSIVE There are entire systems and galaxies with planets, suns, asteroid belts and space stations. 
-Theres POI and derelict ships in orbit to explore and strip for parts.
-There's a ton of factions that give missions and have their own trading.
-Planets are incredibly diverse.
-The Devs seem to actively err on the side of fun for the player. Instead of silly tasks that just eat time, they automate the stuff you do that is tedius with the understanding that you get what your character would have had to do but they want you to have fun. i.e. Individually click on a thousand little rocks your drill made by mining OR it automatically picks it up for you because nothing needs to be that realistic. 
-Theres  a drone you can use to mine, help you build, look around corners etc. SUPER fun
-A lot of POIs, more than any other survival game I've played.
-Exploration is challenging and can be brutal if you're careless. 
-You have to think about what you need with you when you go out for different missions and exploring POIs. 
-AI and NPC bad guys are simple but extremely effective. Theres not a whole lot of tactical movement from them but its tough to make it all the way through a POI without dying.  You have to be careful and on your toes.
-The amount of things in the workshop are ridiculous; Look at how much people post and have posted. 
-Even if you're not a builder there's more than enough Blueprints in game that you can make to have fun just by inputting materials, it does it for you.

In some ways it reminds me of Fallen Earth - an unpolished, clunky diamond, but there is something there. The core gameplay has improved massively - although there is some stuttering when big events are happening. AI is still pretty bad - aliens will wander around in some bases and not chase you, attacks on your base just come in a straight line and are pretty easy to fend off. BUT, still, I keep getting drawn in.
Building can be a bit fiddly - pressing Page Down and End to rotate blocks isn't overly intuitive at first, but you get used to it. Some of the creations on the workshop are outstanding.
The single player game has also vastly improved - taking many hours to complete. Some of the POIs are really well crafted. You can tell some of the in game dialogue has been written by someone who's first language is not English and it can be jarring to read. (I'm not trying to be nasty - I only speak one language).
As well as Fallen Earth, it also reminds me of the original Elite - I'm totally immersed in this universe. I hope the devs pad things out further - a better trading system (it's pretty bare bones at the moment), bounty hunting, smuggling, etc.",1472876367,1625982532,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Instead of fixing the important stuff, and giving this some live with a decent Game Designer, Graphics and look and feel, they adding more and more useless features in a game already full of bugs. Not necessary to tell that these new features getting the same amount of bugs as anything else...

As of this point, the game has been updated to include a fair amount more content, and certain aspects of the game have been changed, making the game, a true game. There is always plenty to do.

Edit: I would say that as of now (7/8/21), this game has fallen flat on its ass. I would still recommend buying this game, but you'll need to get past the first few hours to have any fun. It's pretty broken, things that people have complained about for years aren't fixed, and the devs seemingly refuse to fix them. The game itself is playable, and most of it is fun, however about 40-60 hours in it rapidly loses steam. As soon as you've built your first CV you have pretty much played the game out. There are other things you can do like build massive bases, but after a short while this feels pointless, because nothing challenges you anymore, the devs didn't really add any late game challenges. There is stuff to do late game, but it's pointless because you don't need it to grow any more powerful.

You could join a server and do the same, but you'll be destroyed by meta ""death cubes"", or limited by the servers ridiculously low build limit.

Running the server on my own PC works, but I can not give myself admin permissions. To even do so I have to enable telnet and connect with Putty to the server.

These things are not something a user would have to deal with to run their own server.

The difficulty is not too hard now that I got used to the game, but is more fair overall, though I will let my initial statement of it stay above.


I still say that if you want to set up a quick server, that runs 24/7, on anything other than windows and play with your friends via it, this game is not good for it. The co-op game server works fine, but you really do need the 16 gigs of ram they recommend.",1625258648,1625633114,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Example #1 (The first thing that happened to me).

I was doing the tutorial, went through almost all of it, I believe I was at the second to last goal left where I have to do a waterplug in or whatever at a lake. It crashed. Fuck it, I figure I got the gist of the game, same thing like any other survival game right?

I start the game as Defender on the official server on a Snow Biome....

I died countless of times trying to find food, because there aren't any ways to produce any near me, thankfully I made a bike within that hour half time frame (Compared to what I could've done going to a normal biome; this crap is ridiculous, cause if I was on a normal biome, like I was in tutorial, I could do anything and everything with ease, this level of difficulty isn't worth the starting items (You get a laser rifle, when in even the easiest mode has a minigun (they both provide miniguns, but minigun is pretty adequate)).

So I try my hardest to continue, and I do. I manage to find a crashed space ship and dig it out, and take a lot of stuff off of it. I run into an enemy level 4 oxygen base, survive and take out many enemies. NO PROBLEM (Remind you, this is about 5 hours in, because I already had a good weapon, for food I kill stuff but was running out of things to kill for meat).

But because of the turrets, I stop my siege on the base... WHATS THAT, a level 2 base nearby? Hmmm, If the other one is 4, maybe I can take out a level 2 with ease! I walk into range, and I get instgibbed/died. What? Must be a stroke of bad luck, cause the oxygen base wasn't even similiar to this- must be. Oh crap, again? Again? I can't get my bag. I lose all my shit. My bike too btw...

Fuck this biome, let me restart... Wait, you can't restart? You can't swap planets?

Alright fine, I'll go to the other official server. Log in, go through, get all my shit. OH shit, forgot to go to the Armor thing and put on the light armor outfit... Cause.... The only way out is to jetpack upwards. FUCK I missed the jump (That I can't even do btw, cause I can't go backwards, and I didn't wear my armor) What's that? Some people told me to go back and wear my armor... How tf can I? There's no teleporter to go back!

Why the fuck is the beginning zone requiring you to wear something to fucking get across? Why can't I just walk out and play the fucking game? I made one mistake, and I can't wear this stupid armor to jetpack the fuck out of this place in the new planet and biome. And there's only one EU server left that is official, but you know what? Fuck that- I don't want 300 ping.

I regret buying this game, it's not user friendly. Has bugs that I didn't mention that I tried to overlook to just play the game- I know how early access is. But the fact that it's set up this way fucks you up if you make one mistake. If you don't pay attention to every single thing; I'm here to have fun, not be a archivist, or be perfect, cause I sure ain't fucking perfect, and I'm sure you aren't too.

[b]The good:[/b]

[b]One of the best builder of the market:[/b] You can build 4 types of creations: hover vessels and small vessels that can be parked on big vessels and bases. The vessels are required for attacking enemy vessels and enemy bases, so that you can get the opportunity to fight inside enemy bases and loot them. If you do not want to build, you can download from the Workshop many amazing creations made by the community.

[b]Survival shooter:[/b] You can fight 4 types of NPC: fauna, infected creatures, robots and armed enemies. Actually, the funniest part of the game is shooting for hours inside a enemy base, trying to make your way to destroy the core, witch is the device that control the base.

[b]Unlimited content:[/b] You can create campaigns called scenarios, that can contain custom enemy bases, enemy vessels, dialogues, history, planets, etc. This scenarios can be uploaded and downloaded from the Workshop. You can check a very popular custom scenario named Project Eden to see the potential of Empyrion to gives unlimited content to the player.

[b]Well balanced:[/b] Empyrion is a survival game. You need to work to get resources and build your tools, bases and vessels. You need to protect you from hunger, disease, radiation, temperature, enemy attacks to your base, etc. There is a progression system, so you need to gain experience to get the right to unlock knowledge for build stuff. You can choose if you want to begin in a easy environment or in a hard one (no recommended for beginners), but you will need a powerful vessels to fight zones of very hard difficulty.

[b]Not very resources demanding game:[/b] Empyrion can be played on a budget gaming computer. I currently play this game with a GTX 1650 and a CPU of 4 cores at 3.6 GHz. I get an average of 45 fps inside planets at medium settings and above 60 fps in open space at 1080p resolution. Most of the time my CPU is less than 50% usage. The low CPU usage means is possible to find servers to play Empyrion with more than 100 players.

[b]The game is not finished:[/b] The game needs more work on the AI and physics area, but the real issue is that has many minor bugs.

The NPCs and their presentation feels like an old school MMO, static placement with indicators. But since the game is also a multiplayer game, I suppose this makes sense.

But on the plus side the resource gathering is satisfying, and the research trees are surprisingly expansive.

The motorbike's camera seems to be locked to the bike's movement rather than being attached to a camera boom, so you inherit all of the movement of the bike as it flies up and down hills which leads to needing a barf bag in 2 minutes.

 The game itself are nice looking and if u ignoring bug here and there its quite playable. Starter planets are well balanced and its giving u ample opportunities to develop in 7 days of the day u deploy your base. All what u make will re-spawn after 7 days, now just to clarify once when u leave starter planet that limit is removed, and your base/Ships is on 30-day timer in which u need to come online before its de-spawn. Now u left starter planet and that X rated scenarios start to be visible. To get rare resources u will need kill NPC bases or go in space to mine. If u go and kill NPC base u will get some rare resources and u will need about 10 PO bases for some decent ship (2/3 hour Each and supplies) or go in space and mine. Now this are where PVP sectors are coming in place. Well, PVP are part of the game u thinking but while u warping in sector u see bunch a Floating turret, and your ship are Destroyed. What happen u ask yourself???
 Well u port back to your base and decide to make one more with more turrets on to defend u and try again. Now we are in the end game part where certain people will use Hacked/indestructible/Floating ships which will decimate u in seconds. Reporting them to the Devs will not do nothing. U will make another ship and try get those resources, and they will be there. Killing u one more time, this time u make video and send it to the Devs. But nothing happens!!!

When I describe them to people I often hear ""I heard that was just like Minecraft."" So, ok, this is a block builder, fully descructable, fully craftable environment. They all have various biomes. But that's really where the similarity ends. Between Empyrion and 7 days, I tend to prefer Empyrion, there's just so much more to do. You can craft ships of various types and uses, build bases, farms, on many different planets and in space. I think my biggest bonus with Empyrion over 7 days is that you can build automated base defenses in Empyrion. In 7 days, playing by yourself, they're inevitably going to overrun you and you spend all of your time repairing. Here, the enemy raids can catch you unprepared, but when your base is setup defense is pretty much handled. I hardly worry about it and just focus on exploring, fighting aliens, and building. This game shines for that reason, you can be creative and take your time on a base and it can last. I spend most of my time trying to capture POIs, building, and resource gathering. I almost never have to repair anything, just keep the ammo stocked. For that reason I recommend this game over similar titles.

[Updated at 408 hours] I got this as an alternative to 7 Days, but for some reason I have trouble staying interested after awhile playing. I have tried Factorio, Satisfactory, and 7 Days. While Factorio and Satisfactory are more about automation, Satisfactory is certainly similar to this game. For some reason I keep playing these other games looking for something more grabbing. But, Empyrion is way ahead of them. I think my problem is my creations are always looking the same or take way too long to build. I don't like using the (great looking) community stuff. I feel that removes the main point of this, building and creating. I do love this game and consider it the top of the heap in this type of game.",1608828683,1625330051,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although my recorded play time is 13.5 hrs on steam, I've probably only gotten in about an hour or two's play.  the Game crashes (a lot) and I left it open overnight after another crash (silly me).

Items regularly despawn, sometimes via bugs, sometimes via ridiculously low despawn timers that are part of the game.  When this happens on constructors that you've dumped a lot of resources into for crafting it can be incredibly frustrating.  I imagine this is why the game comes with multiple game modes such as free build and ""freedom"" which allow you to play the game but spawn in what you want - honestly if it wasn't for that mode I probably would've stopped playing after the first time I lost items.

The missions are all basic scripts and buggy as hell.  You can skip steps within them, but nothing to break your immersion like having to go into a menu to tell the script you already did something.

Enemy AI is almost non-existant - in one early mission you have to enter an ancient tower and clear out infected inside, you can shoot them in the head and they won't shoot back if you're taking cover behind a corner.  This is a shame because gunplay feels alright.

There's a lot of negativity here, but it does feel like the game has potential, vehicle models are nice, systems aren't quite as complicated as space engineers.

Try to play this game vanilla and the best ship you can get is a giant bus. Everything I built is brick-shaped and functional.

The okay:

Overall it's a lot like space engineer the simplified version. You can ignore most of the complicated physics in ship building and just strap in whatever fits and ended up with brick shaped things because you have a finite number of blocks you can use to make a ship and cubed shaped blocks are usually the strongest and cost the same as the other blocks.

Empyrion is an older early access title that moved to a 1.0 version and still retains what modern players call jank, meaning there are some clunky systems and things can be rough around the edges.  There's nothing unplayable or immersion breaking about the jank, and I haven't personally experienced any bugs or crashes. 
 

The survival and builder elements are all in here and you can create some super interesting stuff.  (Just check out the steam workshop!)  These systems work well but could be tutorialized better.  There's a lot to take in with the game between survival mechanics, builder mechanics, travel/driving/flight mechanics, and combat mechanics.

The game shines best with regard to building/exploring/salvaging and even mining, if you're into those activities.  Digging a wreck out of a planet where it's half-buried and breaking down all the parts is a lot of fun (for me at least).  Bringing your creative visions to life is also fun and you can spend a lot of hours building things out.  A few tutorials on youtube will catch you up on the systems and how they interact, and it's not too complicated.

The survival aspects, after the initial part of the game where it's a little challenging keeping yourself fed, become a bit of a chore.  Sometimes managing radiation or heat/cold exposure can be interesting, but often it just feels like a micromanagement hurdle as you rush out of your ship, mine a little, then rush back because your too cold/radiated/whatever.  The game has a fairly detailed injury system where you need to produce different types of meds for different injuries.  None of that matters though because death has very little penalty.

Dying in this game means you respawn with full health, no injuries, and about half of your food bar filled.  A quick run to your backpack and you're right where you left off.  The only real annoyance of it is putting all your tools/weapons back in the toolbar, and this WILL get annoying eventually.  You *can* get killed in an area where retrieving your body is impossible, but it almost takes effort.  We're talking standing next to an enemy base that bodies you instantly.  Even then I think you could tunnel to your body and fetch it from below...the only risk is that it despawns before you can get it.  Because of this, the injury system feels like a real miss.  Why bother stocking radiation meds/ointments/bandages if I can just die and respawn?  This is particularly true if I'm out somewhere away from combat or near my base.  It's more trouble to gather these things and manage them then it is to just die and respawn.  Death has no real penalty.

Finally, story elements, NPC factions, and most importantly combat are quite weak.  The story and questing systems work fine, but it's pretty basic stuff:  popup text, click OK, kill X of Y or similar, and at the end quest autocompletes.  The NPC factions don't have a lot of agency, though exploring their settlements is kind of interesting?  I think the reputation system is pretty blech.  You can spend a lot of time building rep but if you're chopping through some underbrush and your harvester module TAPS a dude in a random patrol, boom.  You're going from honored to neutral, or even worse.  Ditto for firing weapons at an enemy structure when you're trying to scan it (this is actually super easy to do).

Finally, I thought the combat and engaging with enemy factions would be fun but it's pretty bland.  The weapons feel pretty similar when they fire and the amount of damage they do isn't particularly well balanced.  Space combat is god awful and floaty as hell (similar issue for atmospheric combat, though less floaty and easier to aim).  Enemy factions launch 'raids' at you that are either a series of drones or a dropship that puts down troops.  These come with boring regularity and are just an annoyance.  Mostly you'll be pissed off when some rocket drone blows up your ship that's parked outside or destroys your solar farm, forcing you to rebuild.  This can happen pretty easily if you don't notice the raid message.  Enemy base raiding, which I thought would be cool and fun, isn't really much to speak about.  The bases aren't meant to be confronted and you won't be blowing them up until late game when you have superior weaponry.  You can cheese these encounters or learn to be a flight combat god and work your way through them, but the real point is the enemy bases don't seem meant to be taken out.

Add this up and combat feels like a real chore against a timer that launches attacks at you at regular intervals.  The NPCs and their machines have perfect aim (particularly the bases), so once they have a bead on you they'll do some damage.  However, enemy drones can spend a lot of time spinning around ineffectually before they even turn to aim at you.  In the end it's just not that much fun watching enemies destroy your carefully crafted creations while you dispatch them with your limp, feels-the-same weapons.  Because death has no penalty even the 'challenging' combat doesn't matter...run back to your corpse.  Mostly you'll be worried about killing the enemy before they can damage your constructions in a meaningful way.

Taken all together, this game is still a recommend but I'm not sure how it stacks against something where building is more the point, like space engineers.  The combat with enemy factions felt like a big selling point but I can't recommend it based on that metric.  Even so, building working creations in Empyrion is fun and evidently a lot less fiddly than other games in this genre.  Give it a whirl, particularly if it's on sale.

However, it has a few flaws with the placement of objects that often impede more creative builds. In multiplayer servers, the game feels slightly more populated, but depending on whether PVP is turned on, this can create more anxiety and competition than as sense of security. Ultimately, if you enjoy building custom vehicles and starships that are operable, this may be a great game for you.

I just lost my ship, because when entering the planet from space the transition sequence wasn't working properly and I couldn't do anything except exiting the game. When I came back my ship was gone. Like for real - couldn't find it on the planet or in nearby space.

It's not the first time - unfortunately I encountered more bugs during my game experience and this is really the reason why I can not recommend this game.

The development team should really focus more on bug fixes. I mean... isn't it a pitty that nower days bugs are treated as something normal you have to deal with as a gamer? This should be prio 1 fixing them!",1624603856,1624604579,False,7,1,0.538856983184814453,1,True,False,False

pvp areas offer competitive mining and learning new strategies from fighting other players to improve your skill to fight pve enemy npc factions. team up with friends or other players to beat enemy faction bases/ships.
hunting dinosaurs is fun and fighting off alien spiders/scorpions/kreepers (thin scary heart racing kind) sneaking into alien bases for items is awesome exciting and the chance to find epic armor / weapons.
set your own goals ; collect a million credits through gold digging or trading, build amazing bases/ships, explore every planet/moon/solar system in the galaxy, earn honored reputation with all npc factions, make a farm/garden, plant teleporters throughout the galaxy like the ancients did in stargate. setup free to use medical stations for future explorers to use in multiplayer, make condos / fortresses / castles. complete all quests. lots to do. go dark side and make every npc faction hate you by wiping them out.

i would like to ask developers to work on first person combat i.e. crouch and prone body positions for shooting from cover and sniping from being in a laid down position. 

and please add grenades in tiers i.e. basic moletov using bio fuel (the gas can) t0 to magnesium grenade t1 to bigger boom from a promethium ingredient t2 to pentaxid inhanced t3 hopefully with item roll and wall richochet for around the corner strategic throwing for infiltration of enemy poi bases.
 
an explosive device t1 to remote detonated t2 to proximity t3

as for astronautic help an option to share suit/armor oxygen to nearby player/friend maybe with a ""o2 share hose"" tool for when player/friend are running low when o2 canisters are not available : could be included into quest tree for rescue operation of npc targets possibly at crashed ship poi on non-breathable planets/moons to rescue for faction reputation point reward.

I enjoy the building, the machinery, the research, the gameplay in general (especially flying around in the 'asteroid belts' haha.) 

The only complaint I have is that entering densely vegetated areas tends to cause some lag.

The game has some polishing that needs to be done but the survival aspects are real. You start with a generous amount of supplies when you land on your starting planet and it may seem easy enough making progress but once you've made some of the basic machines and a small base your resources are going to run out and quickly...so you'll need to make a vehicle to find resources and take them back to base because the planets are BIG and the ore veins are reasonably spread apart. Either that or you can make some weapons and try to assault some of the alien bases you'll encounter which btw are actually quite nerve wrecking to infiltrate. Mainly because they are guarded by automated turrets, drones and infested with alien soldiers as well as their ""Pets"". but the rewards are definitely justifiable. Give this game a go if you love building and even more so if you love space exploration. This game has a very distinct tone and although there's no story, it does remind me of the first mass effect just in terms of the scenery, music and setting

**UPDATE**
Several years later I'm impressed with the progress this game has made. It feels much more fleshed out with robust build tools and survival mechanics. It still feels somewhat janky, but  in terms of space survival games it's got all the right ingredients.
I still am yet to dip into the multiplayer, but as a single player experience I'm enjoying building some crazy spaceships.

I've struggled for hours to figure out how to create a constant source of food and water while exploring and building the base. Unhappily, all of the online help seems to have already got past the basics so they make assumptions about the newbvie knowing where everything is. This gamne at the moment has a steep learning curve, which is why I've given it a thuimbs down. If eiether the help or the tutorial get better, I'll update this posting. For now, if you're willing to invest the time to figure out how the game works and you like the survival game genre, then this game is for you. If (like me) you'll become frustrated because nothing is intuitive and the documentation is wholly inadequate, then wait and see whether the developers get around to actually telling you how the game works.

UP{DATE 1: So, with a lot of perserverance, I've changed my vote, with a BIG qualifier. Forget about playing the Tutorial. It's currently useless. Play instead the actual Solo campaign. It will help a lot, although it too is not always intuitive. Hitting F1 will help. It's a journal of sort. One of the big confusions for me was that two items named the same thing are actually two different items, depending on whether it applies to your land base, a hover vehicle of a capital (space) ship. You can't move items once they're placed. You have to ""reclaim"" them and hopefully all of the components that made it, then re-build it and then place it in the new location. The game itself is very well thought out, it ""pretty"", lots of things to do, clever missions, many individual parts that enable you to buil;d some spectacular facilities. And then there's the promise of planet-hopping, which I still haven't gotten to yet. The game's scope is very ambitious and it seems to be paying off. 

UPDATE 2: I'm now about 74 hours into the game. It is incredibly deep in its programming and breadth of experiences (on-plant, solar system, galactic) and it's attention to the dynamics of the physics of things like thruster power versus load, space ship design elements, etc. is mind-boggling. The game is truly amazing. 

Support for the Steam Workshop was outstanding. I've played over 300 games onm Steam over more than a decade and this was the first time I discovered the Workshop and actually used it to download some awesome spaceship designs. Unhappily, they all require considerably larger and sometimes rare resources that I have nop clue where to look or how to get there. For example, I may need a resource that you can only get off-planet but I need that resource in order TO get off-planet. Basically, you either have to shoot down enemy ships and scavenge their parts or raid terran bases and hope you find those rare items. I'm still trying to find on-planet traders that have what I need.

I personally don't like the trading system. It's not intuitive, real; world or satisfying. But you take the good with the bad I suppose.

BUT A FEW CAVEATS: (1) the tutorial is awful and clearly designed by a gamer programmer who would rather be doing something more creative in the game (2) the solo mission beginning ios mostly good but it still makes presumptions about what you know, which presumptions are unreasonable (3) there are no photos of what the things are that you need to find. I couldn't find a photo of what the spice plant looks like for the life of me - not in the game and nowhere on the web. The players and developers both take these things for granted. (4) TGhere's absolutely zero-information on 

The support forum guides are helpful in a few areas but they're still written with assumptions about the reader's level of game play knowledge and experience, which I found to be even somewhat elitist in their writing.",1623526475,1624116340,True,0,0,0.52668231725692749,0,True,False,False

Before, there was very little to do, and once you got to space and had seen the four total PoI's the game had to offer, you had effectively finished it. Now, there is tons to do, and I find it all really rewarding. I tend to enjoy the tasks that some would consider more grindy.

The story is pretty solid as well, and is quite fun to follow. Exploration is very rewarding, and doing PoI's are very fun, despite the very clunky on-foot combat.

This was after six hours of fumbling around on the tutorial map where both the map and the content are clearly dated compared to the core game.

This is a revised review of the game; Unpolished, Addicting, Surprisingly fun.

You start off tumbling to the ground in an escape pod with nothing but a survival tool and some snack sized bars made of questionable plant fibers (Vegan). From here you may feel you are not getting anywhere early on in the game as a new player since you have so little direction as to where to go or what to do but this is what is good about Empyrion.

You will stumble in the beginning of the game and i highly suggest playing online to get the full experience. Playing solo means you are not competing for resources with 100 other players, have to plan to hit POI's at reset at times and will feel driven to stay online for that extra loot run.

Singleplayer is a different experience offering a casual play at exploration, POI raids (that don't respawn), and resource management that stops when you log off. Both modes are fun but you may prefer going online if you like to push that extra hour into a game to get ahead for tomorrow.

I suggest going to official servers if you want a survival experience and modded/personal servers if you want to group up with people and build massive ships all day.

What impresses me;

When you exit/enter a planet there is no load screen.
Where you enter and exit a planet matters and will drop you where you enter.
Preplanning for POI's is a must
Ship design, placement of parts, and structural strength of materials are all something to consider when bulding.

Yet, it is a great game if you are the type of player who likes (and is good at) role-playing. You get your big procedural universe to explore (and since it is procedural, there is always something interesting to find). Can get involved in power struggles between factions or create your own galaxy wide empire.

There are NPCs and they will raid your bases and attempt to convert them to their faction or simply hunt you down. It is nice to have that normally PvP only element present in  PvE play (you'll also have NPCs to fight when boarding enemy ships etc). You might think that is no big deal but i am comparing apples to apples and the alternative game has a completely dead universe.

Both pros and cons are long lists for this one but pros win out for me in this case. Already a cheap game, get it on sale and you won't regret anything.

I want to preface this by saying that I'm familiar with fairly complex systems in games such as From The Depths, Space Engineers, ArmA and StarMade. Figuring out how things work are part of the fun, most of the time.

But this game is by far, the most unintuitive game I've ever played of this genre. This game is ALL quantity and absolutely no quality. I really want to like this game, but I feel like I'm playing a 2013 GreenLight demo of a proof of concept. The models are trash, the AI is laggy, unstable frame rates, no apparent vision or style other than ""MORE"" (dinosaurs, weapons/tools that look like random models from different artists and character animations that would make a 2004 game dev cry), the most simple actions are overly complex (Because the modules are color coded with no description readily available, you'll likely find yourself accidently producing modules for other entities that doesn't fit what you're creating, wasting large amounts of resources.)

Its just problem, after problem, after problem playing this game. Unless you're into watching a guide on literally every single action more complex than holding shift and running, then this game is probably not for you. Keep getting killed, but can't fight back? Watch a guide explaining a tiny button in your inventory for in-inventory crafting. Want to refuel your hover vehicle, but dunno how? Watch a guide on how to get your speeder running with 'P' as in - ya know. ""Peihcle"", ""Pinventory"" and ""Puel"", just to be greeted with this overly complex menu for such a simple vehicle. Still haven't found out if I need Oxygen to turn my speeder.

Why? Because the only thing that has less of a user-friendly way of explaining things to you than the UI of this game, is the damn guides.

Been playing Empyrion since Alpha 8 and have seen this game grow and be given love by the Devs non stop. This game has had a lot of work put into it since then, ranging from adding content such as items and locations to Optimization of the game itself. While I played the game on and off I seem to always return to it because it has this feeling of accomplishment when you advance and discover other planets in the galaxy you are exploring whether its in Multiplayer or singleplayer . The game has finally past its Alpha phase and now provides a few more things compared to back in the alpha 8 times.

I will say........

Even though Ive spent several hours in this game I do have a few negative I have towards the game.
One of those things is the fact that once you discover a few planets you'll have seen most of the kinds of  it has to offer. One of the other things that at time puts me off is the player and NPC movements of their bodies and how it feels, seems to be enough but it could be better. The Graphics are not 2021 quality to say the least and hope that at least the models for the player and NPCs get updated in a more higher quality. One last thing is the inability to Keybind in this game and it sucks because would be great to have it since there is a lot of systems that could be controlled as well.

Empyrion is a game with potential still and will hopefully continue to develop to something greater. I'd say for the price its offered at its worth it to be honest.",1623560034,1623560328,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Today I began a new game on v1.5 of the fully released game. Within the first 3 hous I experienced following bugs:
- right at the start, at the spot where the emergency capsule lands, I walked around and.... fell into a hole into the planet. I was teleported back to surface after 50 m fall or so, but... 
- the new 'smart' AI lets predators stand beside me doing nothing. Upon assaulting them with weapons they stand there until dying
- while playing the tutorial, I stumbled on some trigger, which killed an Npc that had to be talked to for the chapter to be completed. Hm. 
- I had to access some console. Accessed it, read through the contents, exited the console - nothing, the chapter is not completed, the checkbox for the chapter is not checked. Re accessing the console has no effect.
- control of firearms. When zooming in through a scope, and moving around to target, the 'angle of movement' (I don't know how to express better) is the same as when not zoomed in. With the result, that the movement is no longer smooth, but jumps around, making targeting unnecessary dificult.
The list continues on and on.

I have changed my review to a do not recommend simply because they released an unfinished product as 1.0. The game was at least a year from being completed, yet they suddenly released it unceremoniously with a re-hashed trailer from alpha 7.0. That's a big no-no. The game is still very much alpha, despite the 1.X tags. 1.5, and they're STILL messing with Robinson Protocol. They release major system overhauls and features that break the game and your saves. (Why are they re-doing entire fundamental systems post-launch? Because the game wasn't done...) They didn't even finish the character creator before pushing it out. As such, I cannot recommend this game anymore, when it used to be one of my all time favorites. (I could accept falling through the floor every five minutes because it was early access, but the game breaking bugs and unfinished systems are unacceptable for a full release.) This is not a finished game.

Not too interested in giving a deep review so here's the short of it:

* Been playing the game for a long time.  It gets updates, and there's been a lot of improvements.  But sometimes only incrementally improves things with the updates.

* Combat heavy game but combat is a slog.  Enemies are absolute bullet sponges (even on easy) and I require end-game weaponry to even feel like I have a chance.  FPS gunplay is really basic and ship combat mostly amounts to strafe-gunning.  You get lots of guns but only will use a few as the rest aren't as effective.

* Building ships/bases works pretty good, never had much issue with that.

* 3D spacewalk mode is absolutely an uncontrollable mess.  You'll only want to stand up in space when in an artificial gravity field.  Fighting in zero-gee is just not fun at all.

* Planet/solar system is nice and expansive.  I don't remember what alpha version that was added in, but it definitely made the game feel more open.

* VERY unstable.  Tends to crash, and usually takes your save file with it.  I've lost nearly all of my saves due to crash or the saves suddenly just stop loading (causing a crash mid-load).  NOTE:  I am being told this is an issue with my computer.  Maybe it is?  I don't know, I don't have issues with other games.  So take this critique with a grain of salt perhaps.

It's an okay-ish SE/NMS clone that I think is a bit too ambitious for the developer's standards, but I wouldn't recommend placing a lot of time in the game as it will not reward you.",1623028588,1623111087,False,10,1,0.520398795604705811,0,True,False,False

The graphics are a bit PS2...no I take that back, they are very PS2. I have a GTX 1080Ti with the game at max settings, it runs smoothly but the picture on my 2560x1440 screen doesn't look like the screenshots on the store page - just sayin', maybe it's me? The character animations and movement are janky at best...uhm...that's being fairly kind given what else is on the market in 2021 - 25 years ago I would have said they were great but not today. The story script is clunky and seems very shallow at this point. Tech tree and inventory management are passable but nothing to write home to mother about, as are the procedurally generated planet surfaces. There seems to be a substantial number of resources and parts for building (I have barely scratched the surface of that so far) but the 'wildlife' is limited in diversity on my starter planet and again like it's all been lifted from a PS2 game. Ok, this is an indie game so nobody can or should expect AAA but the lack of polish to almost everything here is REALLY in your face - on the whole I have had a very 'meh' time so far (if first impressions count, that's definite downer), however,  I will persist and see if the broader gameplay suddenly overwhelms all the shortcomings, in which case I'll give it a thumbs up like the overwhelming majority of players who own this.

Edit: 6 June 2021. I played this a little more and it's just rubbish, really, really bad. I have played dozens of survival/sandobx games and after 13 hrs in game I still am unable to figure out how to start building a single bloody thing. The interface is 2nd rate and the game mechanics are neither well explained nor intuitive - I had to google and then read a steam guide to figure out how to start building a base......two words for that, unfortunately the second one is 'off'.

Gameplay is pretty good too, but again, there are some mechanics that are not added yet, like crouching. Another thing i hope we see added soon.

The game in of itself is amazing, out of all the games I own similar to this, the planets in this game feel alive. Ships and stations have half way decent NPC characters. The games universe can feel as massive as eve online given the right mods.

That being said there are issues, trees will randomly lose their grind boxes and cant be removed, even in godmode it can be impossible to remove the tree

Lack of logical block limits and controls to control those limits. There is an option to turn on and off block limits but it does not work. Your still stuck using only 24 solar panels on a base. While for a small base this would not be bad but if your building a sprawling civilization its highly problematic.

Be prepared to eat ammo, as most enemy in the game are advanced beyond player tech in terms of speed and agility verses size of the ships.

If No Mans Sky had a baby with minecraft you would have Empyrion Galactic Survival. Imagine minecraft but with access to a massive amount of different shaped blocks that lets you create rounded edges or even thin walls or door frames. Create a unique base on a planet, moon, or even space. Add vehicles which are also completely craftable piece by piece, choose from hover vessels to small vessels. Small ships not your thing? Build a massive capital ship that blocks out the sun. After you create a ship fly it out of the planet and explore an insanely large galaxy filled with planets, enemies, astroids belts, space stations, and SO much more. Team up with friends, discover NPC factions or enemy factions , create factions or go solo. Trade with factions or wage war. The choice is yours.

It has very many annoying ""features"" which I would call outright bugs that need to be fixed.  As I've already been admonished by what appears to be a developer stating that I suck at the game and that it's not linear, the former may be true, but the latter is definitely not.  The quest tutorials and the chains of quests that follow must be done in a specific order to complete them and receive credit.  The developer was trying to say that the quests can be engaged at any time, but you should be aware that certain actions will make those quests inoperable, permanently.

This is a survival game, a solo game can be saved, but note that it is best to plan ahead, as many items, points of interest, and features of the game will change permanently.  These are simply features of the game itself and not bugs in any way.  The quests can be engaged at any time, BUT ARE SPECIFICALLY LINEAR in nature, but are not required to survive or reach the maximum level of 25.

Here are the top 10 bugs I have documented:

1) Unless your alt-tab is rather specific and timely, the cooperative game has real difficulty differentiating between the client and the just in time server it launches in both Win7 professional and Win10.  You can alt-tab all day, but unless you get it exactly right, it almost always returns you to the server blue screen.  The cooperative server likes to take control of your system.
2) Gigantism.  While playing co-operative with friends, one of our group logged on and was about twice the size of the other toons.  You can see an example of this at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2458509879
3) Randomly and occasionally your toon cannot access the P menu controlling the ship. I've most seen this in collaborative games with friends with win7 and win10 clients. Suddenly, you need to have another friend pilot... even stranger or more frustrating, suddenly the P key will start working if someone else pilots to another system.
4) Different people will see different views in collaborative mode.  I'll see a few ships blocks painted green, while others looking at the same view in a similar perspective see different textures or colors.
5) Sometimes ships will completely disappear although they still exist.  We have a flight deck with a few small vessels ready for a Zirax attack, and one or more people will not see the vessels at all until they move a significant distance away and come back.
6) Many waypoints you set on the map in both systems and planet maps will not be removed even if you specifically remove them.  Depending on the player, our cooperative play is inundated with waypoints that are not supposedly shared, but definitely are and sometimes can be removed and sometimes not.
7) The solo game doesn't turn off sound when using the pause key.  WHY DEVELOPERS DON'T MAKE THIS STANDARD BEHAVIOR IS SOUL CRUSHING.  You paused the game for a reason... phone call, bio, etc...
8) The games autosave and saving mechanism is still very annoying and problematic.  I saved a couple times in creative mode last night while developing a new ship... I see the games in the directory and had a win7 BSOD (not their issue obviously) but even though they show up in the directory, won't appear when rebooting the solo and creative mode... I'll probably need to edit a .ini file.
9) It's supposedly a futuristic game where we're exploring new star systems... and active radar doesn't work!?!?!?!!?  My GOODNESS!  We've had active radar for over 50 years yet suddenly you need to ping every 30 seconds or so!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
10) The factory doesn't allow you to pull material from it or sometimes just ignores your active blueprints.  It will also completely consume a factory built item and all the material.  Yes you can go into “cheat mode” and recover... but you shouldn't have to.

Petty Annoyances:  
1) None of the sizes of vessels show much consistency.  You can have a medic station on a hover vessel but not a small vessel!
2) The shields on small vessels are less powerful than hover vessels.
3) They've actually fixed the solar and fuel powered systems on bases, but are still extraordinarily complicated to use.  I'm a power engineer, and I've gotten them to work reasonably well, but I can't imagine the average player figuring it out.
4) Signaling and sensor equipment leaves a lot to be desired.  Counter-intuitive, but mildly functional.  Boarding ramps can “follow” doors or sensors, but standard unarmored ramps must be specifically inverted.  Without spending hours of trial and error, you won't get them working as standard digital AND/OR Gates etc.
5) I think the developers are hyper sensitive about critique.  When I criticized the absolutely stupid implementation of the power/solar systems during alpha, they told me, a degreed Power Engineer at the time, I didn't know what I was talking about.  When I critiqued the mission progression as having ridiculous time constraints and silly time wasting side missions, they essentially told me I suck at the game and that it's non-linear, and learn to play better.
6) This is still a Beta game... It's not as highly polished as say Conan Exiles, or even close to something like Kerbal Space Program.  The game is very close to Conan Exiles, just in a different environment and unusual interface settings.
7) Food:  Empyrion and Conan Exiles suffer from the same idea that you need constant food to survive.  While that's mostly true, but forcing the player to eat constantly 2 or 3 times per hour is just posing unnecessary and not realistic attributes to an already, difficult, survival game.  Realistically, you only need a minimum of food 2-3 days, but potable water needs to be consumed daily.
8) Grow plots require Oxygen, actual flora require Carbon Dioxide.  Sealing airtight stuff is a huge pain, and the equipment is arbitrary at best, nonsense at worst.
9) The game dances between realistically portraying speeds and arbitrarily pretending gravity exists and doesn't.  You must realize this isn't simulation... and something just imagined by the developers.  You may fly at 100 m/s and need 30 AU's to get to the next planet, but they're ridiculously wrong when using actual ISO units of measurement. There's pretend reality here and it may be confusing if you're used to actual gravity, flight characteristics, and distances, like KSP tries to simulate.

Recommendations:

	If you can get beyond the critique I've listed above, is it FUN?  Yes it is and a great way to hang out with your friends.  Is it buggy?  Yes it is but just remember that in a coop game... once something is destroyed... it's gone!  It is a survival game and we've destroyed a few small vessels, but won great rewards.
	Is it worth the purchase?  ABSOLUTELY!  My friends have been playing together for at least 4 months (about 4 hours a session) and having a wild time taking down bad guys and increasing our resources.  We've made incredible ships... and if you actually do the Entertainment vs purchase price.  That's 4 months x 16 hours /20$ = 3.2$/hour of entertainment!

2021/05/30:  They still don't have the save games corrected and this is a very sad update to this review.  If you save or leave a game, or the system crashes as Windows often does, you shouldn't lose an hour or more of game play.  That may be acceptable to console users, but not anyone using a PC.  I lost about an hour an a half of gameplay due to my system crash but I had saved and still have the save game.

I love it . I've put 2500+ hrs into it since Oct. 31, 2016, Very intense game at times. Dev team seem to be pretty good too. That's a big plus for me. 

I  recommend this game. :)

EDIT: Still recommend this game and more so now. I've played some Co-OP and MP on a private server and both where great fun. But have not tried the Big servers were Factions fight Factions. Not my cup of tea as they say.

The Amount of ships you can make form even the steam store is pretty good, we'd start from nothing: using bikes.
then move onto hover-vehicles,
then move onto personal attack vesseslls,
end game is to have Capital ships (Which take a LONG time to build/get resources for).
You'll find lots of planets to go to with different environments, like acid rain, heavy gravity etc. you hope your ship's ready to take them on.

over all, Empyrion is a game while it's not as polished like some other Space survival games, it's still a fun time killer to play with mates.

I am sorry dear devs, but this is unplayable. I have spent 4 hrs in it just to give it a chance (I wish a quit sooner before 2 hrs mark to get a refund), but the game is hard work. The game is about survival and building. Survival is trivial (at least on the green planet) and building is horrible!!! One example: Instead of dedicated menu for building we have to spend ages staring at our inventory, drag & drop components to make ouput component. In case of building blocks you have to make them this way, then put them on your hotbar, select them from hotbar and then place them onto ground. And here I had to spend, litteraly, an hour on the Internet to find out how to rotate stuff only to discover that I can't - there is separate tool for that! WOW :/ At this point I gave up.

I do not care about outdated, lifeless graphics in such games and I do not care about music and sound effect (which are really bad - they are breaking any kind of immersion) as long as the systems put in place are user friendly and enjoyable. They are not!

Just going through the tutorial and noticing things like bad snapping mechanics and placement.
A lack of instruction in tutorial regarding simple things like changing rotation or height before placing. I found the controls, but still it's the kinda thing that should be introduced first time in tutorial when you go to place something.

Solar panels, what they hell, why won't they snap to a roof ? Tutorial says after I captured a base to place either a generator or solar panel.

If you pick generator, no prob easy to place, but I wanted solar, it would only snap to the ground properly, but not a roof, always ended up being suspended in mid air, even if I manually adjusted the height of placement.

Quite frustrating, I am used to unusual placement and snapping systems (built some pretty advanced stuff in ARK), but this one just was just flaky with certain items.

Vehicles geez, nice idea, poor feel/implementation. 
The bikes are ridiculous, worst turning circle ever, completely unrealistic, not fun to ride at all.
Hover vehicle, well its great its so fast, again though even with adjusting properties of the vehicle, it doesn't feel right at all, not fun to drive.

Overall it feels like the game is lacking a lot of polish and with the snapping system being how it is, feels like the game isn't really finished yet.

What is possible to be built and selection of blocks looks promising, but far too frustrating with the snapping for some items/blocks. To be hit with that level of frustration so early into a tutorial is a poor sign of what is to come.

Hopefully they will give this game some more polish, because I feel like its a shame such a great concept is let down by a few simple things.",1622002718,1622027900,False,10,1,0.509228229522705078,0,True,False,False

The game has a few bugs, such as turrents not killing the drones; sometimes it's a little hard to work out how to do things; However, it is early access and overall it is fun and there is so much to do.

The good things are, you can build bases. You can build ships. There are AI enemies trying to kill you (though they are a little dumb at the moment). You can go into space. You can go to other planets. You have to build ships to progress.

The real killer for me is the sound, the sound effects are terrible, and there is no way to reduce the loudness of them, every time you go near a shutter it opens, then you move away it closes and this seems always to be at max volume, your tools, despite being cool laser tools make annoying loud pick axe noises.

It seems to even get to playing a game you need to devote a lot of time to learning the systems, but for me the UI was really clunky, every item is an icon, and when you mouse over a giant wall of text appears covering everything.

There were times when things happened I could not understand, and had no idea how to find out what was wrong, when my crafting would just stop, I didn't know if it was power, or what?

And when I start the game is says low memory, and then it works anyway, what, why bother putting that message there, either you work or you don't.

I'd say it has potential, if it was early access, but this is 1.47, I don't think the sound design is going to be redone, and I don't think the UI is going to be redone.

- The game is still being developed - that means that there are constant updates which adds to the game.

There are of course some cons to the game:
- game could look better (not that it bad - you still can see some gorgeous views)
- animations are quite bad - you need to push through it
- you cant walk on the ships that are flying (still you can while their static - awesome!!!)

Other games come close - there's probably an apt comparison to something like Space Engineers - but Empyrion's had FPS combat and such a lot longer, and they're divergent enough that if you don't like one, you may like the other instead.

I've spent most of my time playing this on Linux via Steam Play Proton with great success (add 'PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1' to your launch options if you have framerate issues like I did), though I've had to run a Windows VM to host my own multiplayer server.  EAC is not supported under Linux, though. (Check out user reports on ProtonDB: https://www.protondb.com/app/383120 )

I'm a pure PvE player in a private group of friends, so I can't speak to the PvP or 'big server' experience, but the faction mechanics, offline protection, per-zone configurable PvP, and general moddability/extensibility looks like it could support some really interesting long progression type servers.

PvE Points-of-Interest are varied, even though after a while you may see the same buildings and start to memorize their layouts.  The procedural generation reminds me a lot of my other favourite game, 7 Days to Die, in that it designates zones and then plops in buildings and such from a pool.  Said procedural generation makes a *big* galaxy by default, too, though you don't *need* to go beyond your home system if you don't want to; all of your raw resources and materials are in-system, though they'll be behind jumps to other planets in said system.

You can also still play this single player and have a decent enough experience, but like most survival-build-craft games, it's more fun with friends.  Maybe one day I'll try messing around on some of the bigger servers, to see how people expand to fill said galaxy. ;)",1621561665,1621561665,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Try to imagine that game with all those promises fulfilled minus procedural weapons.

NOW try to imagine that game with MORE than what Starforge even thought about having.

NOW try to imagine that game still in Pre-Alpha with the developers STILL adding more content and in regular, short intervals.

NOW try to imagine that game with a roadmap that is still pretty long.

NOW try to imagine that game ACTUALLY BEING PLAYABLE, STABLE AND IN HIGH FRAMERATES.

This is quite possibly the early-access system utilized perfectly. Devs not taking much time between major updates, listening to the player-base and keeping them in the loop, keeping to a roadmap, fixing bugs shortly after discovery. 

Eleon has refreshed my belief in the early-access market. This system CAN work and Eleon has proven this.

This game IS still early-access so it does have a few rough edges (like character models and animations. For example: I've never seen a wrist bend that way when holding a rifle.) but none of those rough edges kill the fun for me. I've had a blast with this game since day 1. I encountered a few bugs with ships but those have been addressed and fixed. 

The OST also really gets you into the game and actually matches your surroundings, be it Akua - the earth-like planet, Omicron - the desert planet, or in Space. It actually makes your survival adventure FEEL like an adventure right from the title screen.

It is possible to leave your starting planet and go to other planets far away, thereby discovering new environments and biomes as well as creatures and minerals. It will be necessary to do this in order to get the ores you'll need to make the later tier equipment and weapons. I love how this works out because it starts you out with the ability to create a ship and equip it to be able to defend itself so you can then take it to discover new worlds, which rewards you by letting you build the later stuff. It's a tech-gate, yes but it's one that works and encourages you to explore.

[strike] The only thing I don't like so far is the early tier constructors. Certain things in this game require prerequisite minor parts to be constructed before you can build them. This means if you don't already have them in the constructor's inventory you will need to queue up all the minor parts then the major item, but the thing is there are only so many steps you can put in the queue requiring you to keep a close eye on it to make sure you keep it going or you didn't mess up. Fortunately the final tier constructor will automatically queue up the minor prerequisite parts in a SEPARATE queue before building the major item so you don't need to queue up, say some metal pieces before constructing bullets. That constructor will handle that for you. [/strike] EDIT: This has been changed. When you want to build something if you have the materials needed all constructors queue up the prerequisites you're missing then starts building.

EDIT 07/24/2017: A number of updates ago the first tier constructor was doing the prerequisite parts auto-queue. The only constructor that does not have this now is the survival constructor.

If you're into survival I HIGHLY recommend picking this up. It's not even finished yet but what is completed is so well done and implemented that they could probably release the game as-is and it could pass for a completed game. Space-exploration, building your dream ship/dream base then using them to travel to far away planets; what more could you ask for?

More procedurally created solar systems and, indeed, GALAXIES? That's on the roadmap :)

Oh and by the way: This is created on the Unity engine. The same engine Starforge utilized. Let that sink in for a bit.

EDIT: The broken-wrist thing when holding rifles has been fixed. Your arm looks normal when holding the assault rifle now.

In an attempt to get back into this game i have really had to work at enjoying the changes. I coulndt, they have added ""detectors"" that were origionally part of the ""suit"" that you started out in. Both good and bad that, i understand the mechanics behind a material detector, however they have gotten small enough in the RW, that having a bulky item is just stupid. Other equiptment that has been implimented seem more concept then a though out idea, not only that they seem to only half impliment these items as well. they can do this but can only do this .. 

This game has still gotten worse over time OVERALL, minor improvements have been made, and absolute screw ups have been removed. (any one remember the small ship drones that spawned you started to build?"" i dont know if they are implimented becuase i simply could not get past the failed beginning of the game. 

Simply horrible graphics at higher settings ( 2gig video card that bogs down ONLY on this game when resolution is turned up 16 g ram.) There is very little in the way of plumage, and other things that should lower the frame rate so dramatically. Terrible implimentation, and refusal (ITS BEEN 2 YEARS) to fix. 

BUYER BEWARE ITS CRAP AND WILL CONTINUE BEING CRAP STAY AWAY!!

7-2019

Some minor improvements visually but over all it is still buggy as hell. Not to mention the disgusting chewing in your ear. The devs need to have a recording strapped to thier heads of people chewing maybe then they get the point

What is truly frustrating in to spend hours in-game building something up and have the game glitch so bad you die and have to start over. Just recently i landed my cv on a planet that had bad gravity(my error) and my wife and I got stranded. We fought for hours to save the ship and finally got thrusters enough to move the ship. I left the ship to find more materials and when i came back the ship was in the air and crashed down wedged in a v shape in the land. (thrusters were off) going into the ship and you couldnt move at all hardly. My wife fought to get into the captains chair and made it. Then the game glitches again and says we cant move because a vehicle wasnt docked . all three of them had gone through the floor and were hanged onto the bottom of the outside of the ship. I finally managed to shoot out all three of the small ship's cores but had died 20-30 times doing so. At that point the game glitched yet again and when i died it sent me to some wreck in space. after dieing many times there it finally sent me back to the training base where i started from scratch. Also of concern is the minerals run out and you can not do anything but start a new game. once you mine all the mines on a planet your done if you havent a way to other planets.,1620914806,1620915263,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Maybe the game will improve in the future, if they keep developing it. But as a finished product this game felt quite unpolished and unfinished.

That is a very well known ""Veteran AAA Game Developer"" leaving that review.

Empyrion is an outstanding Proof of Concept. But falls so incredibly short of it's potential due to very poor decisions made by inexperienced game developers.

To the Developers: Do what Viper states. Fix your immediate issues to salvage your game. If you do not, you will lose your core player pool. 

If you don't believe me, spend some time visiting all the top servers. Look at how the top 20-30 nickel and dime the player base AND when their senior staff of the server doesn't even play the game. All the servers that are worth playing on, have so many micro-transactions against your player base it's driving the players away from Empyrion in droves.",1592510239,1620538554,False,1,0,0.491949886083602905,0,True,False,False

Starting from the escape pod you land in with limited resources you explore and discover a alien planet where you must learn craft and build your way to survive, or try the creative mode if you just want to build.
You can build bases on a rage planets,fighting and trading with others as you fly to distant moons and asteroids in a universe the developers are still expanding.

Fast forward well over a year. The game was released, and it was in version 1.3. I decided to play again. And wow. . . everything you can do in this game astonishes me. Starting off on a planet, gathering basic resources. Build a small vessel to explore the planet. Eventually leave the planet to head to space. Leave that sector of your star system to explore other planets. And then leave that start system to explore hundreds of other star systems in the galaxy.

This game has honestly been a dream come true for me. There are few negatives, sure. Every game has them. Some bugs and issues, and some features I'd like implemented. But I firmly give this game a ""must buy"" for any building/survival/exploration enthusiasts.

The game does have a pretty steep learning curve. But once you get over that hump, the game is (nearly literally) endless. And the devs are constantly adding more content to the game. More blocks, more missions and story, more Points of Interest (POIs), and in the next update, even an entirely new faction which the community created.

I'm glad I got in on this game during the ground floor. It started off amazing, and has only gone up in value since then.",1620257256,1620257256,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The NPCs and AI are terrible, the player models and NPCs look pretty awful for the most part. The ship building is good but needs to be expanded upon, not nearly enough buttons for the signal logic system or things for small ships. Why can't you attach basic drills to a small ship for example? Doesn't really make sense to limit the player like this - you also can't walk around on a ship that's moving? Pretty weird. 
The main quests have very simple spelling mistakes in them too which feels like it should be easy to correct, are the devs being lazy? Honestly feels like an easy fix.

This game definitely has its fun moments but still feels like it's in alpha or beta so I can't recommend it as a full release, needs MUCH more things added to it and reworks/polish on its current features. It gives you basic tools but sometimes feels very limiting which is frustrating.

The dev team, however, released the game before it was finished and has done nothing but create an ever increasing set of bugs that is making the game unplayable while releasing updates that add some pretty background images without addressing the core issues.  The game is clearly unfinished to the point that there are several items in game that do not serve a purpose and entire placeholder systems.  The only reason that my friends and I have been able to discern the game was 'released' and pulled out of alpha is so that the developers are no longer held to the standards that steam places on alpha games.  Most notably to make progress actually finishing it.  I am no longer willing to give games like these positive reviews when they remain in an unfinished state but release anyway.  This game is a good game and I do suggest you pick it up IF, and only if, you are okay with the standard alpha bugs, incomplete game systems and understand that it may irrevocably change from what you purchased in the first place.  It is still an alpha game even if the team has removed the standard alpha warnings on it.

As to the game itself, the first person shooting, looting and survival systems are pretty garbage.  You are going to find much better first person gameplay and survival in games like 7 Days to Die or Conan (both similar build and explore games programmed in unity).  You don’t pick a game up like this for that though do you?  Building ships is very fun and simple.  If you are not interested in the challenges you find in Space Engineers in placement and management of your ship systems this brings a much simpler system where you do not need to micro manage things like ammo flow or fuel to the engines.  All you need to do is add some fuel tanks and engines and it works.  Build size is massive, you can make small or extremely large creations with a very diverse set of block options, quite a few decorations and pull some very impressive creations from the steam workshop.  It is the creative aspects of building where this game shines.

Progression is essentially nonexistent.  I hold the hope that the current system system is simply a placeholder as it can essentially be ignored.  There is no sense of developing you character at all.  The only progression you will get is increasing the size and number of the creations you have.  

Finally, exploration remains, sadly, bland and pointless.  It takes some time to get used to the systems and finally build a ship capable of leaving the first system you start in.  From there you can have a MASSIVE galaxy to explore with over a hundred systems all with their own plants and moons to explore. Unfortunately you find out very fast that they are virtually identical to the planet you start on with varied landscapes.  There are less than a dozen true points of interest to explore not counting the small pointless ones that have a few hundred blocks.  Again, 7 days and even Conan with a fixed tiny map have vastly more to explore than this game does.

TL,DR: Empyrion brings some excellent options for creating and building.  EVERYTHING beyond that is currently trash.  If you want the creative aspects, pick it up.  If you are looking for a game and/or are unwilling to deal with the problems in alpha because the game IS still alpha then pass it up and take a look later.

Allow me to elaborate. Space engineers is pure sandbox, so much freedom and nothing to do with it except mess with the mental case physics. It even took way to long to get proper multiplayer. The design of actually using the things at your disposal space engineers is so rigid and limiting, even though it's supposed to be so free, and you have to invent your own problems to solve. This is something I completely despise, as someone who, as I stated in my Besiege review, heavily admires designer - client type relationships, where the creative limitations imposed upon you by design criterion make cognition and creativity so much more interesting, fun, inspired and challenging, because the roots of your creative tree have to first grow to the side of the concrete pillar above it before going straight up. 
This is why Empyrion gets my full support design and mechanic wise, because even though the game is a little obscure at first, there are so many well thought out interconnected systems that interact mechanically, and actually make very sound linear story oriented gameplay as well as freeform sandbox gameplay, either-or, or both at the same time if you want! Little things like the drone when you press F5 and the connected wireless inventory systems make the survival elements of this game such a joy to really get into, and the full set of base survival systems in terms of character and ship building / colony building gameplay are so good at immersing you since there is so much to invest thought into designing and maintaining. Combat, medical, crafting, construction, building, farming, survival, factions inter ship, pvp, pve, GODDAMN BLUEPRINT SYSTEM! 
Everything about this game is superior to any other game of it's type. If you wanted, you could even say Ark Survival in space with ships. Except it doesn't end there! This game is also superior No Mans Sky! Some games have the expression ""You can see it, you can go there."" Yeah alright, but Empyrion does it best. It must be the voxel based design of all the structures, vehicles, and setpieces in this game, but Empyrion also has a planet, solar system, and galaxy map, and is magnitudes more fun to keep being invested in interacting with than No Mans sky.

Edit: This game is out of early access now, and for an indie this game is damn incredible, and it's a huge shame very few people know about this game. But to be truthful, just like Subnautica, I came back after a while and was like ""... out of early access? Doesn't feel like it ..."" because this game is missing sooooo much polish and just little optimisations and changes. Certain placeholder sounds and assets are heavily oudated and need to be updated, a couple pieces of GUI elements need some work, and certain mechanics are not quite finished. I'm really quite dissappointed in Ellion for this, as it feels like they've interacted with their game so much, that they've gone so far outwards that they can't notice little things anymore. Dunno if they just need to do more highly observant and analytical QA testing, or maybe they're disassociating. Either way this game is not a fully released product. It's cool hekk, but not done.

The graphics are not stunning, but they're well done. There's a very large universe to explore and a good variability in the planets in each star system.  You can design and build your own starship,  or manufacture a stock one from a library that has a very large selection to choose from. Regardless of which method choose you'll need lots of resources to construct.  Base building is easy though sometime, not particularly intuitive (it took me a while to figure out that you need an oxygen unit to run a ventilator. And stay away from your base generator if you don't own any armor).  It also takes LOTS of space to put everything you want inside your base because every you place requires at least a single block space to place even if it's a small lamp.  No pushing things back against walls to make room for other things. Despite that, your base can still be made to look pretty cool with a little planning. 

You start the game with no friends but several races that can be converted to friends if you run missions for them. Missions however can  be pain in the a**.  The starting ones with fairly simple e.g. hunt these bugs and explore this tower. However, others are irritating.  For example disarming a series of mines that requires you to use a transporter that teleports you a long way  from where you've parked your ship with no way to get back other than to have another ship parked at the destination. No problem except that requires you to have a capital ship that can transport a smaller ship you can drop off at the teleport destination and capital ships take serious resources to be able to construct that you may or may not have on hand. So you have to reload an earlier game and wait until you have a good sized capital ship. Also not all capital ships can carry smaller ones so you have to be careful which one you build, especially if you have limited resources.  Moving around in missions can also be extremely problematic, especially where there is no gravity. 

Speaking of gravity, there are lots of things that don't make any sense from a basic physics standpoint.  For example, while in space if you're not wearing an EVA and Jetpack in space you will fall down and away from your ship if you try to step off it, just like you've just stepped off a tall building. So much for the no gravity in space concept. Also the distances between objects on the ground and in space are ridiculous in the extreme given the vastness of the distances involved. For example, the distance between you and an object on a planet might be 3 miles. But when you reach it you've already traveled half way round the planet! This is the same on all planets and in space as well.  It doesn't effect game play but really trashes the realism thing. It's irritating because its an easy fix, i.e. just move the decimal point on the distances so they appear further away and the speed of the ships such that traversing large distances in a small amount of time makes sense.  

Another odd thing is whereas it makes sense to warp between star systems (i.e. they're light years apart) the planets and asteroids in those systems are also light years apart which is plain stupid. Our nearest neighbor is the star Alpha Centauri which is 4 light years from Earth and trillions upon trillion of miles away.  Yet when I warp into a star system in Empyrion the nearest planet in that system might be four light years away! Those must be mighty big stars holding all those planets and asteroids in orbit around them at those kinds of distances. No such thing as sub-light travel in this game,

Despite these really dumb oversights on the part of the developer this is still fun game to play, so yeah, thumbs up.


(Note to Eleon Game Studios, get in touch with an  amatuer astronomer to fix the absurd oversights in distances I've mentioned above. It would more realism to the game play.

The game is what you expect from the genre. I found it more engaging than space engineers since there's more sense of purpose and exploration to be done. Construction is deep enough to be interesting and shallow enough to be approachable.

Here are the bad things that I could live with:
 - looks like doggy doo doo
 - runs like doggy doo doo and melts your graphics card while doing it
 - has really poor sound effects that will probably grind your gears
 - hitboxes are bad when using weapons and tool guns
 - AI is one step better than a T-pose. Most of them sit there and do nothing except occasionally charging you. Most prey will just keep going about their day while you laser them and their kin into meat steaks.
 - Part balance is bs. A full steel block for a Capital Ship is 1 ton. Pick a shape that takes up a tenth of the volume and has a quarter of the hp and it weighs about 600kg... yup. 40% less weight for something that has nearly no volume or hp. Then add the fact that half the parts in the game are radioactive and half of those will also roast you alive if you get too close and you have a hard time fitting these essential parts in your ship without periodically irradiating yourself.
 - The UI is slow, ignores 30% of your clicks and feels dated. Also some fields (like naming components) will simply not work. You set the new name, press enter for good measure and it still doesn't save the value.

Things that I can't live with:
 - Although a good time sink, combat is nearly unapproachable. If you want to attack a base with your ship, good luck. The base tier turrets are enough to give you a hard time and have enough hp to survive minutes of fire. Once the turrets are down, you can approach the base on foot to attack but there are so many enemies and spawners that it'll take ages to fight through and there is no real room for gameplay variation.
 - The save system is nothing short of horrific. Why someone thought this was a good idea and hasn't changed their mind or been diagnosed with brain cancer is beyond me. The save system works like save slots. The game auto saves almost all the time and you can't just Save, you can only create a backup. If you need to reload, you continue playing and overriding that backup. Since saving is important cause shit happens, you will end up with hundreds of save files of your recently screwed up existence. Once you reload a save, make sure you create a new one that you can switch to.
 - Massive gaps in gameplay. There's so many gaps in the features you would expect - stuff that's the natural next step for the game. There's no renewable fuel source for those that would want it. The resource needed for shields and warping never gets easier to collect so you'll constantly alternate between exploring and mining pentaxid. There's nothing to make interstellar travel easier in the late game. There's nothing that makes fuelling your big ships easy enough to stop fuel from being a major limiting factor. You can make a ship that's kilometers long and has all the bells and whistles. And you can power it for a whole hour of gameplay too!! Aluminium and Platinum have no uses. Other metals have niche uses and can be unreasonably hard to obtain.
 - Shields take like 10 seconds to come online and consume way too much energy. You will never hear of a sci-fi where the captain has to say ""I know it's risky but don't raise the shields cause that'll mean we need to spend an extra 10 minutes mining fuel next time we need to do that"".
 - Buggy as all hell. Walking off a platform on your Capital Ship causes physics glitches that can either send you flying through the air or squish you into the ground - breaking your leg. This is one of many bugs that can be very inconvenient.
 - Many systems are simply not implemented. Containers have a max volume. Ships have a mechanic that limits the number of components you can install without upgrading their core. Problem with these 2 systems is? They don't do anything! You can fill containers to 100s of times their capacity and overload your ship with several times it's capacity with no impact.
 - Construction is a pain in the ass whenever you don't want your ship to look like a borg cube. The shape selection for parts is limited. What's more, finding the right part for a particular gap is time consuming, slow, frustrating and half the time leads you to realize that there is no part that fits. That's of course after spending 15 minutes looking for it. A feature to automatically cycle through parts that fit with the surrounding parts would be invaluable and really shouldn't be that hard to implement.

This is a fantastic alpha. The only problem is, the developers decided in April last year that it was ready for release and since then have don't almost nothing for the game except the odd hotfix.

As an early access game I would have recommended it. As a released game I say hell no. Developers need to learn that giving up on their games and hitting the release button isn't right and betrays the trust and faith that buyers have.",1562422476,1618899520,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nothing in the game is intuitive or has any explanation.  It's just been frustration after frustration.  Unlock a gatling gun for your hover craft?  Great, now which ammo does it use?  

There are also variants of key items specifically for use in your base, hover craft, etc.  Fuel tank for the hover craft.  Fuel tank for the base.  They're both called fuel tank and the only indicators to their use are little colored dots in the corner of the icon.  I wasted too much time running around my base trying to lay down an item only to realize that despite the name being the same it's not the correct version for that system.  

And why wouldn't I realize immediately that it's the wrong version when I can't place it, you might ask.  Well that's because even when you are using the correct item the placement system is just awful.  Items float above where you place them.  You can't place them in areas that seem obvious choices.  The game has pitch and yaw even for placing items like solar panels.  There are literally more options that are annoying and will never be used than there are actual locations to place something.

soooo all in all this is a great game, well worth what i paid-nearly logged 1k hours so ive gotten my moneys worth id say. again, super detailed when it comes to optimizing your ship and base. vast universe. sensible controls. story/quests not so hot. ai not so hot. -BUT- every time i come back to it the devs have made big and, for the most part, really good changes: like the addition of repair bays that restore missing blocks based on saved blueprint---it was a real beach piecing your ship back together from memory lol they also did expand on the story/questing the last time i installed...not great but definitely more and better. so reasonably active devs make for a big plus in my book. they also seem to listen to their users so another big plus. *wish they'd bring in an option to allow docked ships to shoot again....used to be able to build an ungodly flying fortress that way lol* look forward to th devs buffing the ai/out of ship combat a bit and giving the planets a bit more umph--a bit more immersion and this game would be a real knock out, so close to being a 10/10

I am 3600 hours in now and still dabble about with designs years after initial purchase so it still has something to offer an oldtimer like me. Unfortunately I no longer understand what the game is trying to achieve in vanilla or the most radical mods. Recommended overall but its not without flaws.

Vanilla now has a brief period of survival followed by a rapidly reached mid game put your feet up in comfy slippers period followed by late game bug stomping of all comers. Strangely however the game never gives you the full capability to leave ground or orbital stations behind and live 100% on your Death Star/Spaceball One as it cannot be fitted with solar power or all factory modules. I say strange because there are now more solar systems in the game than you could really visit in a lifetime without having to return to fixed locations. 

Mods such as Eden and Escape from Purgatory add to the Vanilla experience, extra missions here or there, maybe some new equipment, resource gathering changes, some de-restriction of control on factory capabilities (furnaces etc) and a slowdown of the mid game depending on which mod you pick and experience you want. A little more EGS without many downsides.

Reforged (and mods adding Reforged). Personally i thought the game was in its prime when there was a soft cap of 7500 CPU, weight and volume was on and no shields were available. The soft 7500 CPU back then was akin to what you would get now in a Tier 3 CPU region around 750,000 to 900,000 with only light shields so the slippers were nice and comfy but you were not simply using bug spray to kill the enemies. Fundamentally I am with the Modder 100% on what was aimed for but not on how it was delivered.

In summary the game can provide a varied experience if you want it to, many hours of enjoyment, scratch the itch for content creators and is welcoming for both the solo and co-op player. If however you want to have a bit more of an experience than Vanilla while avoiding the easy mode of bug stomping but adding in forced ship specialisation it may be that Purgatory or Eden on their own with a self imposed CPU limit of 750,000 to 900,000 or for a little easier but not too easy time, full Tier 3, will deliver the best experience. Enough CPU to have good vehicles if they are single purpose while maintaining some challenge in gameplay and design.",1580350875,1618174941,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The scope to create vessels, whether they be small land-speeder types or huge capital ships in space is incredible, and the workshop now is full of thousands of designs to experiment with, if you are not so creative yourself!

It's fun, but the survival mechanics are a little lacking and though i love the pre-generated empires, everything seems to fall into a bit of an uncanny valley.

All that being said, it's fun to make ships and work on them with friends, there are interesting places to explore and, despite the bugs, the game does kind of transition well between planets and star systems.

What I liked: 
- The pre-built ship construction is great. If you don't like designing a ship, or hover vessel, you can just pay resources to a factory to build one for you, and spawn it in wherever you like. 
- There are a couple of damaged vessels you can repair and use early game, before you have the resources to buy/design your own.

What I disliked:
- The tutorial is too simple. Not enough is explained about how to play, even though the tutorial is long, and is recommended by the devs. I had to watch streamers to learn how some of the basics of the game are done.
- Base building is frustrating. Want to line your base up with that cool looking ridge...sorry. It had better face a cardinal direction, or you can't build along it. You are stuck building in N, S, E, W. You also must build your base on completely flat ground, or on a pronounced slope, or it will crumble, because you cannot place blocks underneath other blocks to provide support for you structure, as it is impossible to get the right angle to make the block place-able, even using your drone.
- The ""jetpack"" is sad on planets. You are only able to use one when you find armor, and even after you get one it is a bastardized version of a jetpack. It only allows you to hop, perhaps 5m, and then it takes several seconds to recharge before you can use it again.
- Resources could potentially be ""owned"" by a faction. So, in order to mine that resource, you either have to fend off drone attacks, while mining ore ""owned"" by an enemy faction, or lose rep with a friendly faction for mining in their territory.
- A.I. pathing is hilariously bad. Enemies get stuck in structures and voxels, and they do not run right toward you. They swerve left and right, as if unsure of where you are.
- Block/voxel hitboxes are too large, so don't expect to use a corner as defense. Your bullets will not hit your target unless you expose yourself.
- Enemy drones will come and wreck everything you worked for, so beware, unless you are aware that their behavior can be adjusted in the world settings, but only BEFORE the world is created. After that you're SOL. New game. 
- When you go through a P.O.I. you can only damage blocks/voxels with explosives, before the core is destroyed. This severely limits your options, and makes P.O.I.s linear. Also, explosives are too costly for early game, so doing P.O.I.s before you can make them can be a waste of time.
- The vehicle camera angles are terrible, and don't provide much visibility, or allow for much adjustment.
- Vehicles appear to be unrealistically indestructible. You can fly/drive your vehicle straight into a concrete wall at 50m/s and take no damage.",1617996107,1617996107,False,4,0,0.473053872585296631,0,True,False,False

You can build hover craft, starships, capital ships, bases and orbital stations like lego bricks and paint and decal them to your hearts desire to make whatever you like. 

You and a bunch of friends can get together and take a war fleet in to battle against AI enemies or players, and now there's a whole galaxy of planets to explore and fight and survive through. The weapons are punchy enough to keep you hooked and the alien life is terrifying enough to make you reconsider deploying landing gear. Big predators, mutated horrors, mysterious alien structures that seem like some kind of weird sarcophagus or obelisk. 

Find wrecked ships and do your own mechanic work as you figure out what components it could be missing to get running. It won't tell you that the generator slot is empty, you have notice that the generator isn't on the list and put a new one in as a building block before that ship boots up. Keep that old beater of a hover bike you picked up and put it on display in your new underwater showcase, or maybe it's in a mountain, you decide.

You can do cool things like save a blueprint, allowing you to do things like make a series of halls and rooms instead of a full base, saving the blueprint, then spawning it in underground and mining out your new underground bunker or starport base, which gives you amazing defense against drone attacks. Maybe you need structures not attached to the base: build some automated turret outposts or defensive platforms. I can't recommend this game enough. It tries to melt my CPU, but my computer is a 14 year old ""high end"" gaming rig that's been obsolete since AM4 chips became a thing, so you probably won't have the same problem I do if you have anything modern, and they've optimized it well enough that my computer doesn't even complain that bad. So color me impressed, I think anyone who enjoys space exploration and minecraft style building should play this or at least put it in their library.

This game is janky, the graphics aren't exactly stellar, and the sound isn't great. But neither is Lego.
And that's what this is, Space Lego, the game. I've sunk a ridiculous amount of hours into this less than triple AAA game, and I've enjoyed every moment. Even the glitchy bits.
By itself, the game is okay. But adding the Reforged Eden mod and playing a co-op game with mates is really enjoyable. When stuff gets janky, like when I accidentally exploded the generator and engines of my friends small vessal shuttle just from switching it on, we all yell bad words at the game, have a laugh and get on with rebuilding.
(Since then, this issue hasn't reoccurred. As the game is still being supported.)
This game is what you literally make of it. The freedom is unparalleled, and the challenges of surviving are rewarding. 
A lot of parallels have been drawn to No Man's Sky. Our group prefers to call it, Poor Man's Sky. It's not out of malice, but because it's our affectionate nickname for a game which I believe to be creatively better.

The devs dropped the ""Alpha"" tag in order to trick people into buying a very unfinished game thinking it is full release. The devs have stated that the game is still in early access but they feel it doesn't need the ""Alpha tag"" as a crutch.

Review for Alpha 9.0
I no longer recommend this game. The devs are making too many mistakes, I seriously doubt this game will ever make it to a Full Release.

Review for Alpha 8.1.1
The game is Still progressing but the devs are making huge mistakes, they add features that the players demand even when those features will break the game. This latest major patch added the ability to make planets 100x bigger than previous, which means multiplayer servers had to cut their number of players in half. This trend started with Autominers, which still make no sense, once players get enough Autominers they quit playing. They only log on to reset their Autominers. The server software needs a complete overhaul and there Needs to be a way to upload POIs to the steam workshop. The game is currently just a building sim with PvP.

Review for Alpha 3.2.1
It has come a long way since my first review. The graphics are much better, they have added a ton of new content, added quite a few more Enemy Bases, more Mob types, more plants, made a few grindy bits more user friendly and added a way to change difficulty settings in such a way that you can change about a dozen different aspects of the game to customize the experience to what you like. oh, and they changed Lightyears to A.U., as it should be.

That being said, Most of the rest of my original review still stands but the game is even More enjoyable now.


Review for Alpha 1.3.1
for me it was way too easy and there didnt appear to be anything to the game beyond mere survival, no endgame goal.
As far as the ""Galactic"" in the game title, No it isn't. A handfull of planets within a few lightyears of one another is Not a galaxy.

I'd say, as the game is right now, it's a Crafting game with a spacy-survival theme.
It doesnt really have a progression beyond the First you build ""A"" then you build ""B""... it only goes 4 layers deep and doesn't drive you to explore. There are only a few things you can't get in the starting system but you only really need a handful of each and they are WAY too easy to acquire... and then it's Back to the starting system because there is no need to ever leave again.

There appears to be only one enemy race at the moment but there is a contest going on right now to create the look of the bases for more races to come. My experience combatting this race was... Lacking. They attacked my base a handful of times then just left me alone unless I ventured too near one of their bases or went after resources they were guarding.


Considering it's an alpha, I would still recommend the game as it is Because...
It's Playable, It's actively being worked on (I have seen 4 patches go thru this past week) and it's enjoyable.",1461758112,1617184413,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

I would say this games great for giving you freedom, freedom to build and explore. imagine minecrafts building system beefed up on steroids with a whole range of block shapes to use, terrain can be altered to build huge bases into the ground or deep in the depths of space.
The game now feels like its teaming with life on every planet and in space with huge custom scenarios along with various NPC factions players can interact with causing positive or negative effects to the players standing with that faction. 
admin tools make it super easy and quick to host your own dedicated servers and can add custom features like virtual auto miners.
The workshop holds a huge amount content from nice ships and bases to new galaxies to explore. Great if you dont feel like building your own structures, find a ship from a film you like or just to draw some Inspiration from. while the sizes of galaxies on offer is mind blowing.

So now it's complete and I've come back to it to be severely disappointed. One of the first things I find is that it doesn't do key binding correctly. There are still hardcoded keys that cannot be changed and some keys the devs have set aside for there own use making them unavailable to players. The industry has been making computer games for 40+ freaking years now and I cannot believe games like this one still cannot get this BASIC SIMPLE mechanic correct. However great a game Eleon creates, however much work they put into it, IS WASTED if you can't let players configure something as simple as their keyboard to play the game. UPDATE: I changed my review from a down vote after I learned a work around for the key binding issue. The problem was with the controls screen which can easily get confused and lockout any binding of certain keys. The trick is to reset all the bindings, then carefully move and rebind the keys while avoiding collisions. If you get a lockup, then reset and try again, I was able to get something that finally worked for me For certain function keys like F9 and F10 try instead binding to Shift+F9 and Shift+F10. In that case I had mouse buttons I was trying to use for ship roll, so instead I changed my mouse to fire off the later key combos when pressed.

Enjoyable spaceship crafting survival game with some fps game play, an experience based tech tree, and a large but probably not infinite galaxy to explore with independent factions to interact with. 

Regarding game play: This is a survival game, and as the game starts, your first objective is to find the means to stay alive. This means finding food, perhaps water, and on some planets, oxygen. Then you will need to collect resources to construct a base and vehicle(s) to explore the planet, and solar system you find yourself in. 

As of Alpha 9 the NPC factions in the game now have an opinion of the player that is directed by player interactions. In addition there are some story quests to provide some immersion into the game world. In Alpha 12, they added a (I believe procedurally generated) galaxy to explore, and between that version and the exit from early access, there are now additional factions. New features provide extensive support for modding.

Basic survival loop feels good. You can start off on a freezing planet just trying to survive the cold and eventually move yourself up to living on an temperate paradise with ocean-side property and sipping wine.

Ship physics are good. Not necessarily realistic, but close enough to still be very enjoyable while happily ignoring some things which would in most cases honestly detract from the fun.

POIs are fun and interesting to go through. I think some of the designs are remarkably well done and there's a huge variety.

Numerous little frustrations though. Ships cannot fly inside of other moving ships nor can you walk around inside of a moving ship. Containers, constructors, etc... are all locked to a single person. Your friend went AFK while looking at your base's main inventory? Everyone is locked out until he comes back.

And, unfortunately, I don't think it is worthy of a Positive review anymore either. They've added a bunch of... stuff, I guess, to make it feel more alive but the core game is unfortunately pretty unfun unless you do stuff like change config files, set up dedicated scenarios, and get comfortable with using console commands to try and fix stuff that breaks in-game. As a general rule, if you HAVE to use console commands and mod the game to address issues with it, that's a negative review from me.

I don't know how much of the problems are because they continue to insist on keeping PvP as an option in the game, but for sure some of them are. I only play this PvE so my perspective is from that. The AI ships are all over the place challenge wise which is itself a problem when you have no way of knowing what you're up against, but also the AI ships don't follow the same rules your ships do (they [i]could[/i], but they don't) which means you have to massively over engineer your ship if you want to take out something that on paper is much, much weaker. On top of that, there's no guarantee you can ""disable"" the AI ships. If you take out their generators, it'll disable their turrets and cripple their movement but they still move, which means you can't board them. Once they have no power your weapons can't lock on to any thrusters they have left which means you have to manually shoot to disable them or try and snipe the core, both of which are essentially impossible in a capital ship because you only manually control 1 turret at a time, out of 30+ you'll need to ""disable"" the enemy ship in the first place. This makes any space combat / exploration / scavenging incredibly tedious and unfun.

Any bases that have a quest involved at some point are problematic as well, even once you finish the quest you can't disable or remove them without console commands, which means they just always sit there being annoying on your map / radar or even being dangerous, depending, no matter how much firepower you point at them. Non-quest bases are a bit more interesting but there are still huge balance problems - you either HAVE to have shields and a ton of turrets on your attack vessel or just layers and layers and layers of armor and still massive amounts of weapons. Due to the hard speed restrictions and janky targeting / damage hitboxes doing any other kind of siege is pretty pointless. 

Power consumption is also all over the place - some individual devices can take as much power as 100 small, otherwise functional bases would take. Power consumption is also very buggy - it seems to be used faster than it says it would, solar panels and capacitors just randomly don't work when you aren't present on that bases' playfield, and sometimes if you leave a constructor on and leave the planet / sector it will instantly drain all power and stop doing anything (like, tens of thousands of fuel gone in an instant with no production to show for it). 

They spent a bunch of time developing features that are disabled by default, and with good cause - the CPU / Mass / Volume systems are just way too tedious to deal with in this game, even if they work alright in others. CPU especially is incredibly costly to actually add onto your already costly ships or bases, doubly so since gold is required for that (the first non-money use of it) but gold sources in the game haven't been increased from when it was an almost useless ore. It's good that the option is there for people that want it but again, it requires going into config files or admin console and a lot of the devices involved in those systems don't actually have descriptions of what they do or how the systems work, so you have to go read posts about it.

The in-game economy is pretty bad too, gold is not worth much compared to just making devices / weapons / components from other ore which is abundant or infinite if you have autominers going, and the pricing of things makes no sense generally. There is some attempt at trading goods but the profit involved in that for the effort is worse than just turning ore into other stuff. 

Since starting fresh a few weeks ago, I've had to:
Repeatedly stop / start the dedicated server I made to change config settings, to solve other bugs with stuff. 
Use godmode to get my character out from solid blocks that they just warped in to randomly. 
Use the console to rebuild a ship and restore my inventory after early on (when I barely had the resources to build a single, barely-functional CV) an AI ship destroyed mine and my character from over 10KM away in space (which is several times farther than the max range and was a bug, but not one you could just really ""deal with"")
Use the console to try and disable the core of an enemy ship I disabled but would not stop spinning because my turrets wouldn't target it anymore
Use the console to fix my faction with an NPC group after it randomly dropped with no indication or interaction (from friendly to neutral) 
Use the console to warp my co-op partner to somewhere safe because the game doesn't keep track of the ship they're in when offline and load them back in on it

If you want a sci-fi game to fly around, have some combat, and explore, No Man's Sky is a much better option. If you want sci-fi Minecraft, I'd suggest Space Engineers or one of the other like 10 sci-fi survival games out there might be worth a shot, or just get some mods for Minecraft if you already have that. If you want co-op survival, just get Valheim since they are the first ones to believe all the players that said ""stop forcing PvP into everything""

Edit to add: We used to replay this from fresh after every major update. I will probably put some more time into this since I put so much into getting it playable and now that I've figured out how to debug some of these issues, I can at least work around them. But this is likely the last time I'll ever play it, unless they do a huge overhaul, which I can't imagine is in the pipeline. The systems are just too unfocused and broken, there's too much forced restriction because PvP has to be an option apparently, there's just not enough worth revisiting anymore down the road. They are still releasing patches periodically but I don't have any expectations of them fixing a single thing on my list of things that are wrong.",1505027986,1615833455,False,0,0,0.567553520202636719,0,True,False,False

I recently picked up this game and so far I've been pretty impressed. I had been modding Space Engineers to add more survival elements. I think this game so far gets a 7/10. I will say that since they are updating the game regularly it does still feel almost like an Early Access game even though currently it's version 1.4. [As of the time of this review I've heard 1.5 should be released in the next few weeks.]

My overall experience so far has been positive. I'm still working on getting the hang of the building mechanics which coming from a game that more focussed on that seem a bit clunky. I've been using workshop content so far and building it from the factory in-game. I will say that's a really nice feature if you just want to focus on survival, just gather the resources and plug them in. No need to learn the blocks yourself.

It seems you need some focus on combat at least to keep the drones in check. I haven't done a lot of warping around the galaxy as of yet, but the basic story seems interesting. You'll have to do some traveling to get the raw materials you need for Capital Vessels and some Base equipment. If you want to take on some of the more tough Points of Interest you might need to make a Hover Vessel into a tank. The Small Vessels so far have been amazing at getting around local systems and look to be pretty good at space combat once you have a shield.

If you need a bit more challenge you can add new scenarios from the workshop like Project Eden or Reforged Galaxy. There's even a scenario that combines the two called Reforged Eden.

So far I'd recommend this game if you like survival games and space games.",1615786612,1615786612,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Exploration:
   The exploration side of things in Empyrion is fairly enjoyable, it is entirely procedurally generated (Not the Poi's tho), so
   you have an entire GALAXIE to explore! There is a lot. Altough...the planets become a bit boring after you've explored a 
   few solar systems (Cuz you've basically seen every type of planet).
   Speaking of types of planets, here are some of the types:
   Radioactive planets
   Ice planets
   Lava planets
   Tropical planets
   Sand planets
   And temperate planets
   There might be more, these are the ones I remember.
   Oh...and there are also moons.
   So the exploration is a positive point.

Survival:
   There are a few survival elements, but its not the main focus, don't go in looking for the type of survival elements like
   Green Hell. You have to watch your health, you have to eat, if you are not on a breathable planet, you have to watch your 
   O2.
   There is no need to drink, but in the recent updates, the food you eat give a LOT less nutrition, so it definitely is a big 
   focus cuz you run out of food super fast.
   There also is a good healing system, there are a lot of different injuries and diseases, and there is different items to heal 
   specific wounds. 
   Survival elements : Positive point.

Progression system:
   Now this is...not that great. You have a classic levelling system, gain enough XP, you get a level. But the XP gathering 
   system is bad, the only way to gain levels fast is trough raiding and fighting alien outposts. everything else gives little to 
   no XP. 
   Also, there are only 25 levels, each level gives you some points you can spend to learn new tech in multiple categories. 
   But getting to level 25 when you have some decent gear is very fast, I guess that if you are new to the game, it will take 
   you max around 20 hours, probably even less.
   Progression system : Negative point, add more levels.

Combat system:
   Also...not that great.
   You have a decent number of weapons, but the only ones you really need are the Shotgun and the Sniper, oh and maybe 
   a rocket launcher. Other than that, the Assault Rifles, the Pistols and any other guns are utterly useless (In my opinion). 
   There is also no melee combat in this game.
   So how do the weapons feel, well the enemies are VERY easy to kill, even the toughest are easy with a Tier 2 Shotgun. So 
   you can take out a horde easily. And the AI is kinda dumb.

AI:
   Speaking of AI...not good.
   The AI is not very smart, they just stand there trying to shoot you, wich they rarely do.
   There are multiple alien factions, the Polaris ( Wich you are nice too at the beginning), the Talons (Nice too), the Zirax 
   (The only on i think you start off not friendly with), there are also two more alien factions, but i have never encountered 
   them, so i can't tell. The only ones you will fight against mainly, are the Zirax, and they are easy to kill.
   There is also a honor system, you can go to friendly to bad with a species if you kill one of them or if you harvest 
   ressources in their territory.
   So AI: Negative point.

Building!:
   Alright, the building...is...GREAT! You can build bases block by block, you can build hover vessels, small vessels and the 
   huge capital vessels. And all that from scratch! There is so much different types of blocks, different angles. Its just so 
   good. It is the main focus of the game, and is kinda what is holding the game together, whitout the building, the game 
   would be incredibly short, but you can loose hours trying to build a badass Capital vessel. There are also warp drives, 
   shields and a lot of weapons for your ships and bases.
   So if you like building, you'll love Empyrion's building.

Ships:
   The ships control well, and it is a blast fighting with your ships. Here is a lot to say, so im just gonna let you discover it by 
   yourself :).
   But it is a positive point.

Graphics:
   Not bad, not good.
   The graphics are outdated, they haven't updated them  a lot since the release in 2015, so the models are not very good, 
   the textures don't look great and the lighting and effects look bad. Its not a big bummer for me, but is definitely not 
   photorealistic looking.
   Negative point.

Multiplayer:
   I have played half of my hours in multiplayer and it makes the game better, it lags a bit, but once you get going, it is easy 
   and very enjoyable.
   Positive point.

And finally, the Steam workshop.
   Now this is also one of the best things about the game, you can upload mods and any construcion you made, so you can 
   find pretty much any ship, from a lot of franchises, like Star Trek, Star Wars, Halo and much more. If you buy this game, 
   you have to take a look at the workshop, there are 100 000 mods on it approximately.
   So definitely a good point.

Final note:
   Empyrion is a good game, so for any fan of sci-fi or building or exploration, you should check out this game. Another 
   thing is that there is almost no story, so don't go in expecting to find much.
   So imma give this game a 7.5/10

Basically every design problem has kind of a gritty work-around, but there are so many design problems that the game starts to feel like using a series of exploits rather than an actually intended playstyle. 

* STORY: you will be guaranteed to soft-lock at a few points in the main story.  The devs have provided a work-around by simply allowing you to check off progress on your quest as if you had completed that portion - I think most people would consider this as not functional enough for a release version.  The story does not actually provide anything material to the player, so while it does tend to give you breadcrumbs to higher tiers of play, it's not necessary to experience all the game has to offer.
* ATMOSPHERE: there is a striking and extreme lack of atmosphere in this game. There are very well-designed pre-fab faction settlements, space stations, gunships, ruins, etc.  But there is nothing to do and nobody to interact with in these places aside from traders.  The generated biomes are pretty vibrant, but don't feel particularly dynamic.  Some NPCs are actually decoration objects, so as you're raiding enemy bases you will sometimes come across invulnerable and non-interactable enemy NPC models that are actually just ploppable objects.  Factions and NPC types don't have any form of interaction - the friendly trading space station won't fire on nearby pirates, aggressive planetary mobs won't engage with tribal hunters.  There is just no sense of dynamism or immersion.
* COMBAT: On the ground, enemies are either gunbots or super fast melee gap closers.  Totally disinteresting and more of a chore than anything. To make up for a lack of engaging challenge, enemies often hit like trucks and can kill you before you even realize what's happening.  99% of the time, I am using cheesy guerrilla tactics then running to lay low and heal up the HP I lost from a single hit.  The space combat is a little better, but ship AI can get stuck on friendly space stations and just chill there until they explode.  Some story-specific POIs will obliterate your ships with just one or two shots, in a spot you're baited to early in the story.
* BUILDING: You can tell the bulk of the work of this game was put on making a system for building vehicles and bases with realistic constraints (like volume, mass, structural support, airtightness, etc).  All my small vessels look ugly, but it's fun to build one modularly from scratch to overcome certain obstacles.  The choices of block shapes are kind of all over the place and you will spend a lot of time just searching for the blocks that are meant to connect with the one you just placed down.
* UI: The UI for choosing block shapes when building is total hot garbage and will leaving you searching for the right connecting block for minutes.  The game has a lot of complex UI actions, and not a lot of explanation on that front. Certain aspects of the UI feel clunky (like the slight stall time when a constructor finishes a recipe).
* COMMUNITY: There's many active servers that have breathed life into the game, some of which is PVP.  Not sure how that pans out, though.  This game is best played with a few friends all collaboratively building bases, gathering resources, discovering POIs etc.  There is a ton of workshop content to help you beautify your vehicles and bases, as well as inject some much-needed variation and balance changes to the game.

This game is fun, but now after about 50 more hours than my original review, there is a certain depth that is missing from this game. If you enjoy creative building and designing your own ships this game can be a ton of fun for a long time, but if you're going for story depth and immersion, I find this lacking. I haven't looked at it since alpha, so this may have changed. Once the story develops more I think it'll be a fantastic game.

Subnautica provides a clue based survival experience with a natural beginning and a very fulfilling conclusion.  Empyrion has a beginning but the story progression is still being composed and unfortunately new content is only available within a fresh game.  This could be tolerated if Empyrion were still alpha grade but it is fully released and players should expect a level of backward compatibility when updates are published.  Also, Empyrion only has subtitled dialogue and players have to read text (in often broken English) in order to interact with the story.  Empyrion relies upon triggers for the player to trip and advance the story but in many cases those triggers are defective and leave the player wondering if they missed something.  Finally, Subnautica (a game dedicated to Newtown Connecticut) is ultimately about learning cooperation with the environment while Empyrion is definitely player versus environment.  With all that, why do I still recommend this game?  Because Empyrion is simply galactic in scale.  Its potential is nearly limitless.  While other games feature workshops, Empyrion's library features over 100K contributions from some of the most gifted players and authors on the planet.  Empyrion's instability may in fact be part of its charm and keeps you coming back even as you swear that you've had it with its bugs.  Is it in the same genre as Subnautica?

 What i found unacceptable for a 2020 game was the sound and what actually stop me from playing more was the sound design was pulling me out of the immersion. Imagine 4 dinosaurs coming at you, all making exactly the same growling almost at the same time, each step you/they do sounds the same , each bullet sound from the weapon and each bullet hit using the same sound clip .

Even at its early stages, this is probably the game that I have spent the most hours on, maybe second only to Skyrim. I love the open world aspect of the game, and how the building works on it. It is intuitive and easy to learn to do things in this game. The NPC factions and storyline also add a good aspect when playing alone, which is so far the only way I have played the game. The developers are constantly making updates and adding features.
The only thing I don't like too much of the game, which doesn't really affect my review too much taking into account that it is a game and not a simulator, is the physics engine. Space flight feels very arcade-like, which I suppose many players would complain if it were realistic since it would become difficult to maneuver around a planet with true orbital physics. The ships also don't behave properly for their mass when colliding with trees and such on the planet.
The only real bad thing about this game is that you cannot exit a craft or cockpit while it is moving. Most of the time this isn't too bad, however with Capital Ships this can be very annoying. I didn't have enough thrusters on the ship when starting to build it so I wasn't able to stop quickly, so I had to fly out to look for resources. It made it really hard to stop by the trading station for supplies without brakes, especially since I got attacked half way there. It would have been great to be able to at least walk around the ship and repair the hull without needing to come to a complete stop, which took a very long time. 
That being said this is a really good game, with a pretty extensive storyline that helps one learn the aspects of the game.",1615058821,1615058821,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, the game has been fun. If you pick it up for about 15 quid then you'll get your money's worth. 

Positives are a very free sandbox environment with huge scope for construction and playing the game in a variety of ways.  The art style is OK, and there's a a good mix of space combat, ground combat, and player made elements. PvE is a lot of fun when it works. Thereis a single player campaign that kind of works, but I keep hitting bugs eventually that derail it and it won't work again. 

The reason I cannot recommend it is that while it's early access there are no indications it is going to improve in any meaningful way. The last few updates have focused on new content like bases and ships, without addressing significant game breaking bugs in inventory and entity handling. Ships drift off or disappear. Between updates whole civilisations wink out of existence and come back, with your character having no known relationship to them. 

There's no roadmap available for when or if any of the serious issues will be fixed. 

On a more personal note I found the difficulty curve with enemy ships is broken, as are the rewards for taking on super heavies. It's a lovely idea, but ultimately they've been over ambitious. The result is super heavies that glitch, go invisible, or become invulnerable. Meanwhile your own assets require real man hours to build, and can be trashed if one of the bugs occurs. Even if you do take out an enemy ship they may self destruct on a bugged timescale, or glitch out of existence again, leaving you with a trashed ship and a long spacewalk home.  

Subjectively it feels as if the developers are locked in a bubble with the hardcore fans, and are not bothered about making this a working game for general use.",1615041577,1615041577,False,4,0,0.434941232204437256,0,True,False,False

Alot of the systems are frustrating or unexplained, following the story as a tutorial is a recipe for suicide, the survival mechanics make the game far too laborious, especially with how fast food goes down and how hard it is to keep topped up at the start.

Another big neg for me is status effects feel unreasonable punishing. As an example, following the early story (before I evn had weapons) spawns in 2x stun drones which slow you down with each shot. Ended up building weapons and ammo to take them down while being shot at but not before they stacked a slow effect that lasted 7 mins. Took stimulants to get out of stun and got sick from a 'bad trip'. Took medicine to reduce the effect but still died of hunger within a minute because of how fast the effect drained the hunger bar. Respawned and shortly after fell a height and broke my leg...into a square notch area I couldn't jump out...well time to wait a few mins for hunger to kick in.

You will easily get 100 hours of gameplay out of this.

It's not perfect by any means though ground combat is clunky and space combat is just bad. That said Building is top-notch, looting and resource gathering is fun sometimes, the story engaging (though not done yet) and it truly has an open world fill.

383120,87207227,76561198156442673,0,9,4078,0,4078,1614210565,"This game is great to play with friends. Alone, not so much. Unless you go into crafting mode and just explore or do the story. It's essentially space minecraft.

The story is alright. Very... basic. A lot of reading, ""fetch this"" and sudden raids from enemies. It's a story made to get you into space and explore. It's not necessary to do but it does help. 

The graphics. When I first down loaded the game I thought it was amazing. Everything looked so great. After I started exploring I saw how repetitive everything was or buggy. The grass textures are bad, the trees are bad, the animals are cool designed but still buggy and weird. Every planet is a variation of 5-6 planet types. Once you've seen one, you've seen them all.

The game itself is fun with friends. The building is fun, although sometimes very irritating. The building system is very... minecraft-like, but advanced. You have at least a hundred shapes to choose from but finding the right shape is irritating. Good luck wanting to attach something else like decorations to that though because it uses up an entire grid square instead of halves or quarters. So you have floating lights, decor, cabinets, etc. The entire concept of the game is to just mine/loot and build to explore. The good stuff is super expensive and hard to get. So it's designed to be a long game, I guess. 
The skill/build tree is decent but you arent able to get everything? You max out at level 25 so you almost HAVE to play with people to be able to use the entire tree. 
Theres many bugs I've come across and a LOT of server issues. I didnt think that I would frequently disconnect from my own game or have fatal errors. When the message pops up it freezes your character. So often you die from that because its ALWAYS when you're in combat or flying. If you ignore it for 20 seconds it goes away usually. But that can be a long time. Many visual and audio bugs [i.e. chainsaw constantly revving or guns always shooting]. My favorite is if you hop out of the cockpit, you have a 10% chance to become a giant, and every time after that you can become EVEN BIGGER. Eventually I think you max out at about 20 feet tall. 

The combat is... kind of awful. 
The monsters/aliens are awesome. Usually easy to kill. 
Pistols are garbage. The other guns are alright. Usually low recoil guns and decent damage. 2-3 tiers each gun.
Enemy troops have a long acquisition range. They'll shoot you before you shoot them usually. They have stupid good accuracy, too. The points of interest [POI] can be great finds, unless its an enemy base. Even at a level 1 base it has level 15 turrets that can and will instantly headshot you from a mile away while they're damn-near indestructible. A level 3 base is almost impossible to do without tunneling and trying 650 times to raid the place and destroy the spawners/core.

If you're new I definitely recommend turning off the drop items on death and possibly using console commands when you get into a tight spot.

Overall its a 5/10 singleplayer. 8/10 for building, designing, and the concept. 7/10 if you play with friends and have a good time.

Throw in a good deal of A.i factions and bit of a story behind them, wildlife along with some decent sounds within the worlds which are varied and include water. So there's plenty to go at here.

After playing many hours in both single player and multiplayer, I can safely say this game was a lot of fun! It has a good progression to it where you simply start with nothing on a planet and work your way up to getting a capital vessel and exploring the stars.

BUT like all great sandbox games, you tend to hit a wall at some point. With no further things to build and with no story line in play, my wall hit came at around 200 hours of game play. I felt like I finally built a Tier 4 Capital vessel (One of the best ships you can build) but nothing to do with it other than fly around space. It would be amazing to have a place to go to, to fight enemies with the ship and progress in a galactic story line but sadly no. 

Overall, a great game to sink your teeth into but don't be suprised when you hit the wall! :) 

Looking forward to further updates to this game. Hopefully they will add some well needed story/extra progression!",1613650156,1613650156,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some changes in balance, weren't great, but some rather unlucky ideas have also been retired again (like being forced into ""abandoned bases"" (in a building game). Most other parameters and features  (some questionably) can now be adjusted on game/server setup.

Sadly the start loadout can only be changed in config files. The normal early game, even with ""easy"" setting has been made REALLY tedious, boring and grindy. For solo players it takes ages til you can do anything interesting.

Raising the heap of bog standard generic survival grinding (hunger, thirst, ""mining""for hours) seems to be all later patches did anymore. The game has  enough to offer. IT doesn't need to make you mine for ages first.
I wonder how many people try it and rate it as generic survival stuff and refund it in the 2 hours. long before you see and do anything space ship related, which this game should be all about. 

Maybe there is a point in early access games where you should just STOP fiddling with it.

Beyond that: 

The ship/base building part is simpler then in Space Engineers. Which one may like or not. More accessible but less complex and challenging. Every part (reactor, tank, turret, ammo box...) on a ship or base finds every other part. No conveyors or anything needed. Lot's of stuff in workshop mods. 
But there is a lot more actual game and a much better ""universe"" around it than in Space Engineers with it's tiny ""planets"".  
It's more of a game, really.  And past the starting grind a good one. Including alien faction system, enemies and allies, a universe/server wide trade system and so on. 

The planets have been made much bigger now and the poles are not blocked but empty. Step up from the ""energy shield"" blocking them. More planets, nicer planets, moons around ring planets and other solar systems....


Certain problematic things like the physically completely absurd heat/cold systems in space (you do NOT get cold in space in direct sunlight, you get HOT!) can be adjusted in difficulty/server options.
