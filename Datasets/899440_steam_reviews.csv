Ok but seriously, having finished this game once on PS4 (when it first came out) and then coming back to it on PC years later was a treat. 

-General Gameplay-
The Ashborn Aragami that can devour you in this installment can be really terrifying/stress-inducing especially during those first few encounters, but those fights are exhilarating nonetheless. The new weapon types are always a welcome addition in the series and fun to master. I actually found myself using the Melee Weapons more than Guns this time around. I LOVE the new Dive feature, very convenient and just a faster way to travel through the stages compared to previous games. I'm glad the quick and aerial devours are kept in the game, since Predator Styles aren't a feature here. Especially considering that this game's special mechanic is Burst Arts, which are special attacks that can only be executed in Burst Mode (duh) so it motivates you to ensure that you keep your Burst Level at its Max for as long as possible. The other special mechanic is Engage, where you and another God Eater are given additional buffs through the power of FRIENDSHIP (I'm half-joking). The other God Eaters have their specific buffs set already while you can choose yours, and when activated, the buffs will be shared between both you and that specific God Eater for a certain duration. Overall, fun and fast-paced experience!

-The Story-
I really liked what they were going for! If I'm being very honest, this was the kind of story (or at the very least the themes present in it) I wanted to see in Freedom Wars. I don't want to spoil too much, but essentially the MC character is actually given a background in this game. You start off handcuffed and are basically a prisoner along with some other companions for a portion of the game, forced to become Adaptive God Eaters  (AGEs) from a young age. A chance encounter leads you to being given a taste of freedom, so you and your companions essentially offer your services to other parties in need of Aragami extermination in the Ashlands. For the most part, the group you start with has a compelling dream to pursue, and the determination to chase it. Of course, there are more friends that join you along in the story with their respective backgrounds and motivations. Mostly new faces, but I don't see that as a downside! And if you like the Found Family trope, you might enjoy the cast and the way they were written! The pacing for the story can feel a little weird at times, but personally I've always felt that way even with the previous games so I wasn't too bothered by it. Yeah, I do wish the story expanded a little more in certain aspects, but in terms of what we did get, I enjoyed it! And yes, by that, I also mean the entirely new setting and character cast. I really liked that we got to see a glimpse of what was going on in other parts of the world instead of once again making the game center around the Far East Branch (//cough Japan).

-The Characters-
Hugo Pennywort. That's it.
I'm joking, but I definitely have a huge bias towards him. Like I said before, ""Family"" ends up being one of the strongest themes in the game. The group you start with (MC, Hugo, Zeke, Keith, etc.) are already close knit due to their shared background, having to look out for each other under the harsh conditions and mistreatment from the people at Pennywort Port. After boarding the Chrysanthemum, you meet more allies along the way who acknowledge you with either hesitance or mild distrust. But as you go through thick and thin together, find out a little more about these people, so on and so forth, an irreplaceable bond is formed. The usual stuff. And just like the previous games, each character of the main group has their own little arc or moment to shine/develop in the main storyline. Unfortunately, some characters can still feel a bit underdeveloped or their arcs feel rushed, while others had a clear path in their development and/or more compelling arcs (Hugo, Phym). Later on, there is an opportunity to learn even more about these characters through a series of missions. As of where I am 55 hours in, I've done Claire's and Hugo's so far and I'm excited to see what the others are like!

-Visuals/Soundtrack/Etc.-
Beautiful. The characters look nice. The new stages are pretty cool. The new Aragamis look sick (shoutout to False Idol and Nuadha). Nothing much else to say. Other than maybe I wish we had a bit more Clothing recipes, I need the Male MC drip. That and extra clothes for the other characters. And my Idolm@ster collab items.
The music? [chef's kiss] I love you Go Shiina (and the other people who worked on the music too!!!)

-Overall Thoughts-
Yet another fun installment in the series! I actually think if you're a person who's never touched any of the God Eater games before, you could give this a try and still enjoy it without feeling pressured to know the context of the previous games. That, and if you like anime, it gets pretty anime, but I'm sure you knew that already. 
If you are an old fan, there are still aspects of the game for you to enjoy regardless. 
Each God Eater game has their own strengths and weaknesses. For me, I really enjoyed God Eater 3 for it's setting/characters and melee weapon action. I'm still hoping for an expansion some day, even if it seems very unlikely. If they ever decide to just go straight to God Eater 4 instead, that's fine too. Basically I would love to see Hugo and co. again in the future.

And, for me, that risk paid off so well.

God Eater 3 is somehow the best installment in a series that started off with an 8/10 game. It changes so much, and yet it nearly all works. The combat feels so good. The fact most aragami don't take over 5 or so minutes makes it less of a chore to fight them, and I love it. Don't get me wrong, the tough fights of the previous entries were appreciated, but by the end of them, it started to feel like a slog to get through them (it should not take 20 minutes to kill 2 Sariels). This game doesn't suffer from that. Fights are still notable, but they aren't way over the top. And most aragami going down so easily makes the main aragami so much more memorable. 
But there's so much more done better than just combat. This game looks amazing. I like the levels and character models enough, and really like the aragami models, but I cannot overstay just how wonderful the effects look. The magma, wind, Sariel weird blue light stuff, it all looks so good. And this game's music is also really good. Nemesis is the best song by far, but Lord of Destruction and Devil's Gaze are also really good. Plus, the game lets you listen to the bangers from the previous games, which is very much appreciated.
Now, I will admit, I don't think this game improves story or character wise from the previous entries. The story does focus on my absolute favorite character and does them plenty of justice, but otherwise the main story doesn't do story and characters as well overall. But 2 things on that. A: The story and characters are still really good, just not quite to the level of the previous game (not certain about saying they didn't improve from the first one). And B: There are also the Extra Episodes, which, while not required for the main story, add so much. Another Devil is a pretty good follow up to the main story, and Traversing the Past makes so much of the cast so much better. And while I would still say the previous game is better in those regards, at this point, it's far from noticable, because both are still really good. 
And, to mention it briefly, the setting is good. More interesting than the previous games setting, though lets be real, it really doesn't matter that much.

TLDR: 10/10, somehow continuing to improve (or at least be about neutral with) the previous, already great games",1707100957,1707100957,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

肯定有人会拿怪猎来踩GE。怪猎当然很好，但怪猎在我这里取代不了GE系列。

主线打完故事还没有结束，后面的追加任务里还有各角色故事以及引发三代整个故事的关键人物故事。不过这些东西老玩家应该更感兴趣。

慢悠悠的打了71小时 把邂逅过去打完才去做全成就（其实全成就不需要这么久）

整体声音声效和二次元画风综合表现观感很棒，角色性能相比一二代灵活很多，动作衔接比一二代自然很多，更重要的是打击感相比一二代是飞一般的提升。剧情有始有终，基本没有挖坑不填。

当然，我也看到了几个上百小时大佬对武器动作模组和数值平衡性的批评。

I am not familiar with the series, thus I can not compare this game to the previous versions.
The game events take place in a post-apocalyptic world, where strange organisms infested most of the planet areas, driving people to few safe liveable zones. These organisms mostly manifest themselves as thick fog called “Ash”, but sometimes may breed large sapient monsters, called “Aragami”, which means “Gods”. People with special abilities able to fight these monsters are called “God Eaters”.
We play as one of them.

The main gameplay consists of high-speed battles with different monsters on the old world ruins. Between the skirmishes, we rest at the base, having conversation with other characters and attending the story events.

All battles take place at the exact same locations, even the loot items are at the exact same spots. Overall game has approximately 10 different battle maps. The same ruined church, same streets, same canyon and so on. Locations are relatively small and usually have a similar layout with 2 passages/corridors and 2 open square areas. Encountering the same locations all over again looks quite ridiculous considering that according to the story we are traveling at high speed with a caravan through the different world areas. Why all these different areas appear exactly the same - who knows - my guess: it was “end of budget”.

In addition to stamina, which is used to perform attacks, jumps and so on, there is also a special mana-like resource called “Oracle Power” - OP, which can be replenished performing melee attacks.
“OP” are used almost only as the range weapon ammo. There are no special abilities or moves which can be activated using them. The only exception I could find is a single special move with the longsword.
On top of that, all long-ranged weapons (guns) inflict too small amounts of damage. So in the end “OP” became practically useless. The main feature of “God Eaters” is their ability to use “oracle sells” to fuel special abilities to be able to match the Aragami, and where are these abilities then? What is the point of devouring OP from enemies if you could not put them to good use?

It would be much more interesting, if, for example, “Burst Technics” could be activated using OP to perform some special move, or OP could be used to regenerate health, and so on. The game should be like: consume OP to get superpower, low on OP - low on power - go and consume some OP to keep up. But, alas, it is not there at all.

We fight mostly the same types of enemies through the entire game. Even “medium” and “large” Aragami have only a several arch-types, which with new color-schemes appear over and over again as “advanced” enemies. Different enemy types have different behavior and moves. The key to victory is dodging attacks, and then using an opening for the strike. 

Each “medium” or “large” Aragami has weak spots, hitting which you can do extra damage. But there is some inconsistency about them. For example: I noted that extra damage over a particular part can be done using a gun, but hitting the exact spot with the melee weapon deals regular damage. I was able to land a critical hit with a sword only when the enemy had fallen on the ground. To summarize it: I don’t understand how it works.

Overall the battles are fun at the beginning, but soon become unvaried and dull. 

Controls are a real pain even using a gamepad. For example: in order to raise a block you need to hold the “shift” button and press “jump”. It is really hard to pull correctly, while you need to quickly react to the enemy attack. Also in order to perform a special weapon attack you need to hold the same “shift” and press the “regular attack” button. In the rush of the battle it is easy to confuse these combinations. At the top of that the same “shift” used for weapon switch and sprint trigger. At the same time 2 of 4 available “shift” buttons are never used at all. Why not distribute different actions between them - no idea.

There is no experience or level up for the main character. While our companions can learn many useful skills, like health regeneration or damage resistance, the main character could not obtain any of it.
He or she can progress only through the gear upgrades.

At the base you can find a merchant, who can sell you consumables and crafting materials. But she has such a poor selection of wares, it looks like an insult. Need to stock on potent healing items - sorry, we sell only basic ones here. Missing particular “chitin” for the sword crafting - sorry, all we can sell you is herb and magnesium.

The main story is decent enough. It has a theme of friendship, family, civil rights, freedom and equality. There are some touching moments, but mostly it is predictable and unremarkable. The missions we participate in are barely attached to the story at all. Even when we need to breach the blockade created by military forces with tanks and artillery, we…fight “Aragami”.

Graphics look good.
The game provides 3D character rendering while maintaining the Anime-style at the same time, which is quite remarkable. Environment rendered with decent digitalization, although as I have already mentioned it does not provide much of the diversity.

Much effort has been put into the music. There are several songs attached to different scenes and events, but none of those really catch the ears. Maybe in the original Japanese version they are more impressive. Still it appears nice, when at some point of the combat the regular background music switches to a vocal song.
Radio effect sounds weird. It appears not like a radio, but like some tubes. Although I can not name myself an expert in this area.
Only main dialogues are voiced, the significant share of them represented as a plain text.

Overall it is 5/10.
Main impression - it is dull, repeating all the same over and over again.
I have almost abandoned the game several times.

The presentation can be sumed up as ""all that's wrong with anime"". Female characters wearing fetish amidst a post-apocalyptic war doesn't make sense.

The only elements I will be covering are the story, terminal and settings/difficulty, characters, Aragami, certifications/maps, god ark, and customization/accessories.
The Graphics are in Unreal Engine, by the way.
This is also 100% a rant about the game.

 The Story:
(There will be no spoilers in this, so you can read it.)
One of the shortest stories for the God Eater series by far. 
The story is based primarily around character development, about you and your buddies surviving in the cruel world you have given yourself to. Getting to point A by going through B while fighting to secure the route. Meeting new characters, side jobs, discovering, and just running around. 
For those of you who do not want to sit through these story points, you can skip them; Try not to skip during your first play-through, you will get lost trust me. 

Terminal and Settings/difficulty:
The Terminal is the most important shuffle of menus where you will do 70% of your play-through immersed in. Its where you practically do everything in, that said, its the worst terminal by far. GEBurst/Revelations/GE2 all had the most comprehensible menus out of all the GE series games. GE3 is terribly coherent, you will have to sort through manually 90+ menus to find what you are looking for without help. 
Anyway, ingame music outshines player voices and the radio… you got to turn the music down before playing or you will not be able to hear some of the cut sense. 
The difficulty (for me) was super easy… the difficulty in the GEBurst/Revelations and GE2 was grind worthy (you know the good kind). I beat the entire game using long swords and nothing else for how strong and broken they could become. 

Characters:
Where do I start… character stories are fantastic, however, most do not fit the Ash setting the game was gunning for. On another note, just like its predecessors, your buddies will stop moving and not attack the aragami and will just get stomped into the ground at godspeed. The is a rare occurrence, and generally speaking, only happens with some party members. Unlike previous titles, GE3 has better multiplayer, it also has allies that actually do damage to the aragamies, the healers also got a boost in this title making them have better accuracy when you get downed.

Aragami:
The best part about the game.
Hands down love the designs and functions of the arigami, none got to colossi size, but there functionality made them seem so. What I do not understand is the rehashing of past game enemies. Don't get me wrong, I love fighting them, but their placement in this ashen world is terrible. These enemies had a garden feel to them (More vivid colors), and the current feel of the game is Ash; more muddled colors. 

Certifications/maps:
I truly do not know what certifications do for you, I went through the entire game without doing them.
Now in GE3 the maps are lacking but the overall presentation of each is great. I will now rant about the absurdity of the fact that there are things melting in a frozen map and that makes no sense. [Editor note: Coming back a century later it dawns on me how stupidly cool that is.]
Unlike previous maps, they have been scaled correctly… the are not huge and have some narrow passageways.

 God Arks:
Some God Arks literally make the game 10 times easier. 
There are 8 different classes of weapons, depending on your play-style. This is going to include analogies about cars as damage values. Short blade: They hit with the force of a motorcycles with a fast swing to them. Duel blades: Are faster than short blades but hit with scooters. Long blade which is a bit slower and hit like a car. [Editor Notes: Long Swords are the most op for GE3 when I used to play it, a century ago.] Scythe: are slower than long swords, however allows quicker maneuverability coupled with higher weakpoint breaking. Lance: its slightly slower than scythes, has better maneuverability and movement options, hits like an armored car. Hammers: Much slower than Lances, hit like a truck, and has some great teching out of hit animations. Claymores: Much Slower than hammers, hits like an armored bus and than some. Moons: slower than claymores, its literally spin to win with moon blades, and hits like an armored truck.
Now there are shields and gun added, but literally chose one and stick with it.
Just pick a style and run with it.

Customizations/accessories:
There is not enough drip options in GE3 then the previous titles combined. However, GE3 has the beginner workings of the character creation that would be used in Code Vein later down the line, its excellent.

Closing thoughts:
God Eater 3 is wonderful game that is better with is character developments and makes it to where they feel like actual people. The fights are engaging, however its easy. Some of the AI in the game are stupid or over intelligent (mainly enemies.) You also don`t need to have played the first 2 games to understand this one. 
I give God Eater 3 a 7 out of 10, 3 out of the ten is lack of story substance and actual boss battles that do not feel one sided. 
I recommend this to anyone, but get it on sale… it’s not worth $60.

Go Play Monster Hunter World instead of GE3, MHW is 10 times better.

the maps are repetitive and awful just like the monsters in this game there's multiple versions of the same enemy.

the game is boring in the beginning {it gets more exciting once you reach rank 5 which is end game)

the characters are shallow and hollow I only liked phym.

the graphics are outdated just like Bethesda's games.

without a single doubt the soundtracks in this game  are fire asf.

Looking forward to GE4 / Code vein crossover game with old GE cast and CV cast when it comes out as a fan of the series And FFS stop comparing this to MH series since that is purely Monster hunting simulator with a barely serviceable story till MHW anyway (atleast compare Toukiden and MH which makes more sense) since GE is narrative driven story series rather than just a hunting simulator like MH series is.
About the game itself : 
Great Game & Must buy if u were already a fan of the series since story despite being self-contained for most part has major connections to earlier games in terms of locations & story feels like a natural organic progression from previous games even if it's quite similar to previous games. This semi-standalone story also helps newbies ease into the world without playing 1&2

Combat: The combat system is majorly revamped with new mech and idea's not just for u but for aragami as well with their burst ability to balance the scales but some core components have been tweaked a bit  like devouring doesnt give u aragami bullets but is most for burst link for allies & limitations to custom bullets with 0 OP cost but module cost.
2 new weapons introduced Dual wielding and Glaive/Axe combination.
Blood arts & Rage arts from older games are replaced by Accel triggers and Burst arts & Link arts which handle pretty well when combined with quick devour mech so u can enter burst pretty easily.

Aragami: every older version of Major big aragami from older games have mostly gotten new move-sets and newer ones with burst ability are just as strong as the Blood Aragami from GE2RB like Magastu Kyuubi / Marduk.

Companions: Companions this time around are pretty limited compared to prev game due to premise but u can skill up companions according to your playstyle preference with GAP abilities & swap em at any time in hub.

While the concept and artstyle has its (limited) charm, the gameplay suffers by being such a bland, simplistic version of the usual monhun-like action game that it is an absolute chore to get through. Some say it gets better after the first few hours, but honestly I doubt that very much. It has a similar enough gameplay loop - you look around, find the monster to kill, slowly hack away at it while dodging its attacks (plus some conceptually-cool phase changes in the middle). 

The problem is a classic one, which is always simple to say out loud, but hard to describe in any detail: none of it feels right. The weapons feel like pool tubes slowly whacking away at the enemy's health, which feels simultaneously too large, because the fights are boring, and too small, because they're way too easy. The only difficulty that arose for me was being so bored that I stopped caring about not taking risks, something even the worst souls games only managed in brief spurts. 

If the combat isn't done right, there's little hope for everything else, but they fumble a lot of that, too. Running around after every story mission finding the right NPC to chat up with is a slog, and the very generic animu story/cutscenes/characters don't do much for me. Admittedly, it does hit a few awe-inspiring moments from time to time, which were the only reason I played for as long as I did, but sadly what came afterward never managed to pass even my lowest expectations.

Some say it gets better after a few hours and all these complaints go away - maybe they're right. However, I just couldn't bear with it for much longer. I'd say you should respect your own time too, by not playing this.",1700483903,1700484048,False,2,1,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

[h1]Story[/h1]
Set in the 2080's, GE3 takes place in the middle of an apocalypse which is itself taking place in the middle of another apocalypse.  For over thirty years, humanity has seemingly found itself on the verge of extinction due to the Aragami ravaging the planet.  Aragami are strange looking monsters comprised of colonies of individually ravenous single celled organisms known as Oracle Cells which can evolve rapidly to come together into these beasts; among other ridiculous abilities.  The Aragami have slaughtered millions in their single minded goal of devouring anything and everything they can find that fits their appetite, and as if that weren't bad enough, now a phenomenon known as the Ashlands has been spreading rapidly across the surface of the Earth.  Ash takes the form of ominous black clouds that literally turn to ash anything they come into physical contact with; be it living beings or entire cities.  Even residual Ash particles in the air pose a risk to normal humans, turning what looks like relatively safe air into places of danger that can kill a man in mere minutes.  For this reason, AGE's were created as people who could fight in the Ashlands for extended periods of time.  AGE's are an evolution of the God Eater; specialized human combatants from past decades who were linked with man made Aragami weapons to fight off the Aragami, making them partly Aragami themselves.  However an AGE's physical makeup is so close to Aragami in nature, that they are kept under strict conditions effectively tantamount to slavery.  Players take control of one such AGE, belonging to an underground Port known as Pennywort.  After years of slavery, Pennywort is subjected to an Ash storm that effectively wipes it out while the protagonist and their fellow AGE's are rescued by a nearby Ash crawler transport ship from a different port.  The owner makes a deal with the AGE's, giving them a home in exchange for protection during their voyage.  From here, the crew will get themselves wrapped up in the politics of other Ports as they work to make a name for themselves.  More AGE's and God Eaters will join their team along the way as will a person of particular interest to all parties involved.

On a functional level, God Eater 3's story is a total mess.  Much of it feels like reading a book that has had entire chapters torn out and thrown away.  Entire plot threads and characters are introduced and cast aside, never to be followed up on or explained.  The final portion of the game suddenly shoves what appears to be intended as deeper characterization for every member of the main cast, which is the sort of thing that is supposed to take place during the entire story, not during the epilogue.  The game touches on a several genuinely intriguing themes like parenthood, sacrifice, belonging, guilt, unique identity, duty, right vs. wrong, and even the messy social politics of living in a world with legal slavery and how freeing the people subjected to that condition isn't as simple as just saying ""You're free.  Go home now.""  Unfortunately the writing and execution of direction are disastrously abysmal on almost every single front.  The seed of an interesting story is buried somewhere in this game, but that seed has grown into a twisted and rotting weed.  It feels unfinished, rushed, and poorly directed.  Characters are largely one note and not very interesting to be around or interact with, save for one, but frankly her ability to drag a smile out of the player is just plain cheating; though the effectiveness can't be denied.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
God Eater is a third person hack and slash action game, but rather than facing an army of foes and chewing through them, players will rarely be tasked with killing more than three absolute damage sponges. God Eater squads come in groups of four and cooperative play allows friends to take the place of AI squadmates before diving into the action. Every mission starts the same. You approach the front desk of HQ, accept a mission, gear up, and then deploy. God Arcs, your weapon, feature a small variety of melee and ranged weapon classes as well as three sizes of shield. The Arc can swap between these three modes on the fly and there are dozens upon dozens of weapons and shields to craft over the course of the game. Unfortunately, quantity is very much the name of GE3's game. There are literally hundreds of missions in the game; all spread out across the same handful of maps which have no real effect on combat.  Players select their two weapons, their shield, a Burst Art, three Burst plugins and the plugins for those plugins, up to four upgrades for each of the three God Arc parts, as well as four perks for each AI squadmate. And that's not even mentioning the ludicrously complicated Bullet system which is so microscopically in depth that the game never even bothers tutorializing it. You can get through the entire game without ever looking at it, or you can dive deep into it and break the game.  Overall, GE is a game filled with almost entirely passive customization.  One welcome bit of quantity the game features is its massive variety of enemies, but fighting them rarely feels like a battle and more like a chore. They all come with their own attacks, levels of awareness, means of escape, and elemental effects; but they're also extremely inconsistent as some attacks are telegraphed a full decade in advance while others come out instantly and seem to deal no less damage. The more you play God Eater, the more you start to recognize the vague shape of a decent combat foundation. God Eater 3's combat feels like it's one mere overhaul away from being actually engaging, but instead it's sluggish, overly simplistic, and extremely imprecise.  It just ends up boiling down to mashing the attack button on enemies for full minutes at a time until they die.  And there truly are just too many missions which are all set across the same five or so maps.  The game ""map"" and story insist you're traveling on some sort of cross country adventure, but the gameplay couldn't disagree more.  They attempt to put as many passive twists in as they can with timers, squad restrictions, and later on even adding map effects, but this fails to make the bland gameplay worthwhile.  Special missions allow for up to eight players to participate, but like all other missions, it still just turns into mashing the attack button until the bad guy dies.  You can feel a relatively satisfying power climb as you continue to craft bigger and better gear, but the pace at which this happens should have been sheared down considerably. At least you can take solace in knowing that your AI teammates are actually mostly useful and can even defeat an Aragami on their own if left alone with it long enough, though they're also prone to just face checking enemy devour attacks which almost guarantees every battle with an Ashborn Aragami will force you to fight it in its own powered up Burst mode.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
God Eater 3 aims for an anime aesthetic and it is quite successful.  The artists have done a great job of translating anime into 3D models.  Character design ranges from excellent to downright stupid, while the monster designs range from utterly inspired to boring and silly.  Environments in God Eater 3 are quite pretty to look at but are also incredibly static places to inhabit.  Sound design is basic but passable, while the soundtrack does its absolute best to inject some energy and grandeur into the action.  The anime intro is particularly well done, though seeing all the story teases it promises failing to pan out in the story is a disappointment.  Animation is surprisingly weighty and satisfying in combat while the game's cutscenes usually leave a lot to be desired.  It crashed a few times on its own, and has crashed every single time I've attempted to take a screenshot with ShadowPlay.",1700328751,1700328827,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Literally everything else is mediocre at best and cringey af at worst.  I like grindy games, but this won't be for anyone looking for a ""good"" game.  Controls are odd, I don't mind them now but it took 20+ hours of getting used to.  Camera control is atrocious.

Almost quit and gave a not recommended at the point in the story where a loli who can't even talk (yet for some reason calls you daddy, jfc gross) starts following you around and you have to tell her to stop every single time you re-enter the hub.  Any dialogue from the women (kids really) is so awful.  These are characters that can swing a sword bigger than they are but Claire still has a line about ""Running makes my back hurt.""  Get it?  'Cuz of the massive boobs on the child. Seriously devs?  

After 5 hours I think I've seen...3?  Wow, yeah, only 3, different levels.  Very repetitive. 

Worth playing, just skip all the story/ cutscenes.

Edit:  Level variety does get better, unfortunately the game seems to do everything it can to prevent you from actually playing it.  Want to just rush the story so you can grind endgame?  Too bad, go search the hub levels between every mission to talk to people before you can go out again.  At least put all the people you need to talk to on the bridge but nope, search the decks at random 'cuz you missed yet another pointless conversation.  And I think the fact that you can skip conversations, even ones with dialogue choices, shows how little they actually matter.

Edit again:  Sigh.  Maybe I'm losing perspective but the characters are starting to grow on me.

Beat the story edit:  Final boss was cool.  Final boss fight was ridiculously disappointing.  Followed by unskippable credits.  They really just tried to make this as frustrating an experience as possible.  Also; NG+?  What?  In a MH clone?  Why?  It doesn't change anything, you just have to play the story again?  Are you guys high?  Why would I ever do that? 

Character editor opens up again after beating the story.  Why not just have it open the whole time then?  AND the title screen changes after you beat the game.  To a much worse one.  And there's no way to change it back?

Who was in charge of these decisions? After all this, I'm changing to thumbs down.

Probably final edit:  Still playing.  Grinding endgame is fun.  Just when I thought it couldn't get more tedious I tried the Traversing the Past missions.  Soooo unnecessary.  Load in.  Wait.  Talk.  Kill 2 base enemies.  Load out.  Repeat.  Only putting up with it for Hugo, Hugo is great.",1696641946,1698163147,False,13,3,0.555522382259368896,0,True,False,False

If you are in search of an immersive world with further frolic aside hunting-slaying rancorous fauna, this title is guaranteed to be your bane. It may bear the countenance of a proper JRPG (and play like one hither and thither) but it's fatally anorexic on that regard. I should also point out that since the online side of it is now on life support, you'll also miss out on its main draw, except of course if you already have a couple of gamebois who are ready to jump into it with you.

As a God Eater veteran, it's quite disheartening how the franchise never seemed to grow since it first made waves on the PSP more than a decade past. I used to see it an MH antithesis with its faster, more haptic combat flow, but if you put them side by side now, GE's palor would be akin to that of a double-dead specter with its third and fourth demise imminent.

Gameplay
[b]Pros[/b]
> Fast pace 
> Dive System
> Movement
> Burst arts
> engage system

[b]Cons[/b]
> Not enough burst arts
> too easy
God eater 3 truly the peak when it comes to game-play, combat seem fast and you feel like a god eater fast, responsive.
GE3 introduce us to new system, engage and dive, engage is basically mini buff from your allies, dive system is the new defensive/offensive mechanic you can use dive as escape or too engage enemy fast. burst art in the other hand it's basically blood art(From GE2) but this burst art in GE3, you can equipped 3 of them in ground, air and dash ATK, there's not enough burst art too equip and feels like like the game is too easy. and [spoiler] you got claire armpits. [/spoiler]

[b]Story[/b]
[b]there's nothing stronger than family[/b]
ngl feels like GE3 story is mixed with GE1-2 story and pretty simple, unlike GE1  [spoiler]you got a man want to restart everything by devouring this world [/spoiler] in GE2  [spoiler]you got a cripple woman turn your captain into humanoid aragami  [/spoiler] and GE3  [spoiler]you got a family and claire armpits [/spoiler]

naaaaaaaaaaahhh, play on controller for god sake, don't waste your time on setting just to fix of what camera sensitivity should you use, you love your self right?. PLAY ON A CONTROLLER with claire armpits

The only 2 thing that better than previous game is 
1.you can now play Coop-multiplayer with 4 player without ""waiting for player issue""
2.Graphic is better than previous two game

meanwhile everything else is worst than GER and GE2RB.
Main Story is not interesting, 
Burst Art working only in burst mode, 
Aragami HP is too low you can kill everything within 3min without even trying,
Bullet Customize is very limited and the gun is so bad that not event worth 0.5second to switch from melee.
Story telling is very bad, so many character that just disappear or die off scene.

AND No one Know for sure why the hell Adaptive God Eater like MC is treat like Prisoner because the game ain't telling you noting.

===========
7/10 
I'm using i5-4590, 16gb of ram, GTX1070
Pro:
-the game run fine without crash or fps drop
-No problem at multiplayer with full squad (4player)
- 8 Player vs 1 Aragami in Assault quest
-Nice Graphic compare to previous GE:RE GE2RB
-Still feel like God Eater fighting style
-A little better Blood Art System ,you can custom blood art effect
-The story feel like you watching Gundam IBO and Evangelion
-English version with Japanese voice (YES! FINALLY!)
-Female MC have long speech line with cute voice (JP voice though) 

Con:
-No more Blood Bullet and Gun system got heavy nerf compare to GE2RB
-Feel like all skill required Burst mode
-Story is too short, only about 15hours to complete if you are strong enough 
-Story is too rush at late chapter
-Too many character that just disappear even they look like key character.
-The game not telling what happen before game start at all (where Rindou gone? Previous MC? Blood Unit? why Soma change his name? is far-east branch still live? what happened to HQ?)
-Richard's Face will ruin your mood through story

TL DR:
Get in the promo, its not worth the full price tag (got it for 35 R$, so it will be prob around 10 usd?)
Its DMC and Code vein mixed together,combat is fun,theres alot of depth to the weapons/combos
The story is a lackluster experience
The difficulty is locked (dunno about NG+) so its not so easy not so hard, its playable. So for those who want to set it to ""im a masochist/darksouls 2 player"" its not possible. At least i didnt find how yet
========
Basically it`s a mix between Code Vein and Devil may cry, so the combat is fun and refreshing (THERES COMBOS/Weapons switches like ranged and melee WOOO)
In terms of difficulty its .. playable? (i just got past the first missions)its nor hard nor easy,just like code vein. Theres new game + but since im still on shallow waters i willl not speak of NG+ for now
Alot of the enemies are new and/or appear with a new pattern/skills
Alot of free updates
Now to the bad stuff?
The only thing i noticed that its plain bad is the core of the game, yes the story. Its average for those who dont care and for those who care about lore its just meh
It takes time for the game to actually get fun,kinda like Monster Hunter but atleast on this one it doenst take ages
I dont dodge much,but i noticed that alot of ppl claims that it kinda sucks/its rage indulcing. So either skill issue or it really sux (maybe theres no invframes)
ALSO I PLAY ON KEYBOARD, IT WILL TAKE ALOT OF TIME FOR ME TO GET SET TO THE KEYBINDS(ill prob config it myself but for now its default)
Thats it for now, cya
EDIT 1: I FORGOR, THIS GAME HAS MULTIPLAYER JUST LIKE CODE VEIN.

GE3 came out pretty recently and it was a rather disappointing experience coming from someone who enjoys the GE world for what it's worth.

[b] Story [/b]
The story was never the strong point of GE, but my god was the core story of GE3 just unfun to sit through at times. GE1/2's story takes place one after the other, and it is cool to see the connections in the world and between the characters. However, GE3 has nothing to do with the prior GE games besides 1 character. GE1/2 both took approximately 80-100 hrs to complete, but GE3 did not even go past 30 hrs and I went afk with the game on for at least a couple hours. And yes I am counting the updates to GE1/2 but not to GE3 because they do not seem interesting in the slightest or improve the core story in anyway unlike GE1/2.

[b] Graphics [/b]
Idk shit about specs but it ran well enough AMD 5600X CPU and AMD 6600 GPU go figure

[b] Characters [/b]
Undercooked like me in the kitchen, but could've been alright if they had GE2 character episodes structure. Phym is Shio from GE1 but you are her Soma. yay.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
Mechanics-wise probably the best game to date as Burst Arts are essentially the same thing as Blood Arts in GE2, Engage was fine but you get no new ones for the core story besides the base 3. Accel trigger was also fine. Prob the only category that was improved.

[b] Price [/b]
Bought this on sale for like ~$8. Was it worth it at the price? Sure. But I would not recommend buying this at $60 full price. Bandai does not deserve your money for this.


TLDR: If you are GE fan, prepare for disappointment. If you are new to this series, go play GE1/2 instead you get both in a package.",1693010383,1694588709,False,3,0,0.484518557786941528,0,True,False,False

Good:
- Probably the best combat in the trilogy
- The new weapons are cool
- Some of the new aragami are very good, tha ra bird and the moneky with the big arm, both are very fun
- Hugo and Hilda are nice characters but...

Bad:
- The silent protagonist twist was cool once because it was unexpected, it just feels lazy now
- The entire plot feels like a fanfic of the first game, it did some cool things but it was overall handled horribly, phym is just fanfic shio.
- Character interactions are extremely lazy, a lot of times when these characters talk it feels robotic, exception is hugo which usually has good scenes.
- Game is far too easy, I only upgraded weapons because I felt bad at I was ignoring so much of the game.

*** This game is made for console, and it was not ported to PC properly. You will feel that immediately. ***

- The camera controls are terrible. You cannot adjust the look sensitivity outside of a few preset options, and they are not at all comfortable. ""Standard"" camera control feels like I'm playing on 10k+ DPI, ""Low"" feels like I'm dragging my hand through mud, and ""Very Low"" is unusable.
- The resolution options are insane. There is basically no rhyme or reason to what resolutions are picked beyond a few basic ones.
- The combat feels extremely clunky, and it feels like you're just mashing buttons.
- The maps are extremely plain. There's little to no visual clutter, which is actually a negative in this case. Everything feels like you're playing on a board game's tileset.
- The objectives are not explained well. Just in the first mission, there was little to no direction as to what I needed to do to complete it. I just ran around until enemies appeared, seemingly randomly, and killed them until I ""completed"" the mission. There were voice lines calling out for help, but zero indication in the game as to where I should go to actually help these invisible NPCs.
- The customization for your character is decent? But lackluster. Most of it lies in coloring and accessories. There are a few faces, a few eyes, and a reasonable number of hairstyles. Beyond that, it's accessories and voicelines. While I applaud them for their flexibility, there are probably 4 voice actors each for male and female voices, despite there being about 12 options of voice types.

[b]God Eater 3[/b] continues the tradition of taking two steps backwards and one... sideways.

[h1]X-Factor[/h1]
The only improvement over its predecessor would be the better graphics and smoother animations.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Story goes from the nature of humanity and the strive to survive plus an interesting setting of the first game, to a simpler struggle to survive in the sequel, to a “power of friendship” of this one, and while writing never improved or got worse, the scope of this one is less grand than the other ones.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Gameplay sees you slashing and shooting at these monsters called Aragami, beat them, collect materials make stronger weapons, it’s a simple but effective look, it’s quicker paced that most action games, giving you fast movements and attacks, however one of the step backs I mentioned is in the combat system.

[h1]Downsides[/h1]
Each weapon has a small pool of moves, and one of the additions of this entry (that works as a detraction) is that you can set a specific move to be an improved of itself, this way pushing you towards using the much stronger move while ignoring the rest.
Another main mechanic that that is ruined by this entry is the bullet customization system; In previous games you could make bullets shot from your transforming weapon behave in a variety of ways, the only limitation was a resource used to shoot it, the more powerful the bullet, the more of this resource you needed, now they thought to limit uses to a few times making the whole system completely useless.

Moving in a more moment to moment action we find that many enemies have attacks so fast that even your fastest weapon cannot get a swing in before they begin and end their own attack animation (sometimes not having windup animations at all), dealing incredible amounts of damage, while some incredibly slow and telegraphed moves barely put a dent in your health.

Forget about running in this game to get to your destination faster, since another addition made so you could shield bash in a direction for half the stamina but twice the distance, breaking the immersion even further when the best traversing option is hopping like kangaroos instead of running.

Story is boring, dialogue is a waste of time, and the only interesting character has the personality of an annoying kid, music may be good but is incredibly misused, tell me this, where would you put orchestral music with chorus carrying the melody?
At the final boss perhaps, or maybe in a last stand?
Nope, wrong, let’s play it when you are talking to a girl behind a desk that’s telling you where the next mission is going to take place, smart choice right?
[hr][/hr]

All and all, would I still recommend this game?
Yes and no, it’s very janky and a blatant copy of another game without understanding what made the source material work (or even what made the previous entries work).
But, despite being ridded with perplexing decisions, it still works, I’m giving it a thumbs down just because there’s not an in-between option.
Get it only if you really REALLY liked the previous games.

The price is way to steep for the kind of content you’ll find in this.",1669310589,1690302081,False,2,2,0.483022600412368774,0,True,False,False

Whoever is doing cutscenes and facial animations for you is a god. While you may be playing a mute protagonist, the small scenes do a great job of making this less strange looking with the facial expressions on the character which are really detailed and show a lot of improvement from the previous games.

During times of stress or dire circumstances during the story, your character can sometimes be seen looking concerned instead of poker faced, which really sells the overall situation like they really wanted you to feel it.

There's so much style to it, even down to the in battle idle stances-characters are all unique and have their own traits that make it easy to know who's who. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3002597027

There's so much that I want from this game-you know I want more content as far as missions go, but I really want more story missions, cutscenes, pseudo-cutscenes, character dialogue. I would like for you guys to do this whole game again, don't butcher the story, but just take your time on it and really stretch your legs if that makes sense.

I would totally buy a [i] God Eater 3 Resurrection [/i]

The game mentions different ports and organizations, but you can't visit any of the locations and they're all basically irrelevant due to being on a mobile ship. There's apparently an orphanage and school inside The Chrysanthemum seen only in cutscenes and there's this ""Return Gate"" that doesn't seem to be used at all. The game comes off very ambitious, but it's very linear in the sense that you're either fighting or roaming the base.

I feel like you could also make it better for online players, add places where players can gather and interact with chairs and items(Code Vein hot spring, wink wink), more gestures, poses. Maybe add a photo mode cause I can't find one anywhere, consider adding a free hunt mode where players can get together and just hunt until they've had enough, cause most missions only last like 5 minutes. We also have this neat little camp for 2-3 part missions you could expand upon. Let me choose a love interest character maybe?

So I really do like this game, even though there's no way I'm gonna see anything else for it, I could think of unlimited things for it. Might even try and make a little God Eater 3 movie for myself on the New Game+. If there is another one I just hope it features a character creator still or I'll pass honestly.

While I do feel like there was a good amount of content in the game, it's one of those cases where enough is just not enough. Thanks for the experience guys.

A lot faster paced fights, new weapon options, new additions to our abilities and less frenetic fights that still are great and challenging. Still Maintains the same sins in its gameplay loop as its predecessors. 
[b]Story:[/b] Let me tell you again, the GE universe/lore is great! In what is the 3rd mainline game we get a similar story to the other games in terms of main plot devices. I really didn't like the story from GE2, but I can tell you, GE3 did a better job. It has its fair share of “GE moments” and some things that happen just because, but that is GE since day 1, but the story is compelling and makes sense of itself.
[b]Audio:[/b] The voice acting is… ok. As for the music, honestly… it is still great. 
They keep banking on the first game excellence, which is fair...

This was a redemption arc in my eyes, given that I liked the first game, but almost dropped the second one.
I do recommend playing GE3, as its first iteration it is not without flaws, but it is enjoyable.
I still think that is better if you can get it on sale.

For context, I hadn't played any of the God Eater game franchise before and merely bought this out of curiosity. Immediately upon starting the game, I encountered a significant issue: low FPS around 10-20 FPS. That's the first letdown. Once resolved, I realized that this game's selling point is hunting large bosses and engaging in repetitive combat, neither of which are to my taste. So, I continued playing in the hope that there would be engaging storyline or unique experience of some sort, but nope. 

In conclusion, if you're a player who enjoys repetitive attacks against wall-brick enemies and slow-paced battles, or if you're fan of the God Eater franchise, you might want to give this game a try.

Being able to play this at 60fps is great after dealing with it being locked at 30 even on PS5, so if you're here because you want minimally 60fps gameplay then the PC version will do that for ya.

With regards to the story, if you're a long running fan just know it's pretty similar in all regards to the other mainline games, so if you enjoyed those you'll enjoy this. If you didn't like the story at all, I personally found that the stories of GE2 and GE3 are a little weaker than the original GEB or Resurrection, they don't quite have that same emotional buildup to get you invested in all the characters as you go about stuff.

Gameplay wise it feels faster than the previous games. Things move just a bit quicker overall, and while dodging/stepping was still very viable in the previous games I have to say that in GE3, you really feel rewarded for blocking while stepping has become very unreliable. However, there are many fast and very difficult to evade moves, so while it doesn't provide you much defensive increase I still suggest using the buckler shield for the fastest deployment and the easiest perfect guarding. The normal shield is just a hair too slow to deploy to save you from getting hit when you predict one of the annoying instant moves coming, and tower shields no shit don't really open quick. There is a new piece of equipment you get pretty early on that can give you health regen for blocking 70 damage (G>>HP Healer), so yeah, blocking in this game is very rewarding.

I quite enjoyed the addition of new combat features, I won't really go into each of them though they're given to you pretty quickly in the game. I think they added some measure of extra value to the gameplay overall, though if I'm being honest it's still pretty same-ey so returning players won't feel out of place.

As for new Aragami...the Havakiri is the bane of my existence. Seriously. Pretty much everything else is mostly fine, even the most powerful aragami aren't anywhere near as annoying. Well some of them are, so yeah. Devour attacks are a thing from Aragami in this game now, so seriously get used to perfect guarding since you can't block devour attacks and like I said, stepping is pretty much useless in this game.",1686364928,1686364928,True,17,2,0.685533106327056885,0,True,False,False

Game map get themselves repeat again and again non stop even tho it shows ur in new region but the game will load the 1st region map as 2nd region map with new enemies like

spartan OPS where ur constantly forced to play in the same maps again and again 

The game story is good but the gameplay is so damn annoying that u won't able to enjoy the story even because of the annoying gameplay

useless character customization since u can't speak even tho during the VICTORY CHEER dialogus ur can hear wats ur character is saying but HE WONT OPEN HIS DAMN MOUTH

Game MC should be HUGO like in the anime but in this game he aint infact he is just a fucking pussy who relies on his power of friendship blah blah blah blah


Like sonic from SONIC FORCES where he just says bout friendship power all the time infact of doing any shit 

The villians are too easy to read infact they dont even try to have themselves the evil vibes

It felt surprisingly good with the mouse and keyboard despite it is not supposed to be played that way. The mouse aiming also change how i play God Eater 3 compared to the PS4 version, now your weapon can fire quickly and precisely at where you aiming at due to the mouse movement, makes frantic quick shot from a distance far far more lethal than the old shotgun blast I relied upon.

Enjoyed so far, despite how old the game is. It essentially a self sustain game. The game is essentially one of the borne PSP hunting game genre where you fight ever nastier Aragami. It fel great despite all these years. I first played it on the PS4, it was a favorite game of mine despite Monster Hunter existed. However, this game plays more like an Action Combat MMO where mid cancelling is more important than momentum and prediction, it has a very archaic style of combat that it inhereted from God Eater 2, albiet with more skills and shinier abilities you can play with, the core combat is simple, is the abilities like Acceleration Trigger, Burst and Overdrive that keep the combat nice and pacy, the fight is decent, is more of a Action MMO than a Monster Hunting game. While it is different, it felt good and surprisingly well with mouse and keyboard.

Very surprising considered I am a controller bias person when it comes to action combat game.

The game looks great, while it is not a technical showcase of graphical powerhouse, I personally enjoy how the game looks, anime enough and edgier but not to the point of absurdity, just right as a anime game as you enjoy the plot. Plays well and free of any technical issues. This game can be played on very old system and still look marvelous in my opinion. Just don't expect to push the graphical power and melt your PC, it is a nice looking game and I prefer it that way after the major disaster of Wild Hearts(which breaks my heart to say that as I really enjoy it when the game was patch and runs ok until the next patch make it completely unplayable)

I beaten the entire game, and God Eater 3 is probably the very first God Eater game in my entire existence that I have friend to exchange my Avatar with, I tried looking for friends to play with, but the game can be beaten entirely solo and not exactly needing hundreds of hours to do so, just a few days worth of time and bam done due to the AI being ok(can be dumb but I can't blame them) a nice FAMILY story and intersting post ending content where still makes me played cause is a simple liking of the game for its world, story and lore.",1680624461,1684776880,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★☆

God Eater 3, developed by Shift and published by Bandai Namco, continues the acclaimed action RPG series with an exhilarating and fast-paced adventure. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity battles against powerful creatures known as Aragami, this installment offers a satisfying blend of intense combat, engaging storyline, and robust customization options.

The combat mechanics in God Eater 3 are the standout feature of the game. Players take on the role of a God Eater, wielding massive weapons known as God Arcs, which can transform between melee and ranged forms. The combat is fluid and responsive, allowing for satisfying combos and flashy moves. The addition of Burst Arts and Engage mode adds depth and strategic options to battles, allowing players to unleash devastating attacks and team up with allies for coordinated assaults.

The storyline in God Eater 3 is captivating, delving deeper into the world's lore and presenting a tale of resistance and survival. The game introduces new characters and brings back familiar faces, each with their own unique personalities and motivations. The narrative progression is well-paced, with impactful story moments and surprising plot twists that keep players engaged.

Customization plays a significant role in God Eater 3, offering a wide range of options to tailor your character's appearance and abilities. The ability to create and upgrade various God Arc weapons and craft specialized bullets provides a sense of progression and personalization. Additionally, the new ""Ash Aragami"" enemies bring fresh challenges to the table, requiring players to adapt their strategies and exploit weaknesses.",1684519058,1684519058,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is fine. Faster paced than Monster Hunter, doesn't have as much depth in the core weapon movesets, but there is somewhat more variety through the combination of melee+gun+shield.

There are a lot of choices, like the dozens of Burst Art Effects, but most of them don't make any meaningful difference (like one is ""damage in 2 small circles"" and another is ""damage in 3 slightly smaller circles in a different pattern""). And you won't really notice them in the particle spam anyway. Many of the systems are wide but shallow like this.

Main campaign is way too easy. Most hunts took <5 minutes, even though I didn't learn the monsters or my weapon properly yet, didn't match elements, didn't use any item buffs, didn't min-max the party skills. Just kept devour up -> spam melee until gun is filled -> spam gun -> repeat. Didn't fail a single mission.

Character customisation is very limited, especially compared to Code Vein's exceptional character creator released in the same year by the same dev/publisher.

[h2]Now for my rant on the writing[/h2]

The writing is horrifically bad. I'm not talking about the story, which is garbage-tier anime power-of-friendship in a post-apocalyptic world that somehow still runs on present-day capitalism, which everyone not only accepts, but is weirdly enthusiastic about; even the teenagers are excited about jobs, starting a business and making money, while they could be eaten by giant monsters or the world could end at any moment.

The story is easy to ignore for this type of game. I'm talking about the actual choice of words, phrasing, (lack of) characterisation and basic literary techniques.

For example one character says this line randomly when you return from missions (paraphrasing from memory): ""Good job! I'll make the main dish for dinner tonight as a reward!"" Not ""I'll make your favourite food"", or naming a specific dish, they literally say ""main dish"". It's as if an alien, who knows humans like food but doesn't know anything about food, wrote it. There are tons of other terrible lines but this one sticks in my mind because it is voiced and repeats a lot.

Well it's either aliens, or placeholder translations that were supposed to be localised with English names/details/references. The same character says after a cutscene where something important happened (again paraphrasing, but it really is this bad): ""That thing that happened... please talk to the owner.""

Many lines don't flow well, as if they were translated separately, without context.

There're also obvious cases of thesaurus abuse, when a character suddenly uses an uncommon or outdated word with the same meaning as another word they just used in the previous sentence.

The English voice acting is awful but I don't blame the actors, it has to be bad casting and direction on top of the irredeemable writing. The military general, who is supposed to be charismatic but ruthless, talks like an American radio news reader from 1940.",1680547102,1680547519,False,0,0,0.449994146823883057,0,True,False,False

Now yes, the graphics are stunning, quite similar to CODE VEINs style which IS a plus. However one major issue I've had was the camera control. Yes, out of all things this was the thing that gave me the hardest time to the point where I couldn't even play the game. It's bad, it's really bad. Either too slow or too fast, no inbetween. Not only that but navigating through the settings is also such a hassle. That aside the story was definitely a letdown compared to the first two. Don't get me wrong, this game did have me tearing up but despite the writing being good, it was nothing like the first two games' writing. This felt shallow, I wasn't able to bond with the characters as much as I did with the original gang. My entire playthrough was basically me hoping the game would end soon.

Would I recommend this game? Depends. If you're an old God Eater fan then yes, this does scratch the itch, although not too much. If you want to play this as an introduction to the series then DON'T. Buy the 2nd game first, it includes the first one and play those trust me you'll have a much better time. Don'T let the old graphics fool you, those games not only have an amazing story but great monsters to fight. Not that this one didn't have good fights but i digress. If you want to play this just for the Monster Hunter part then I wouldn't really recommend it to be fair. Sure it does have a lot of fighting to do and the graphics are really good, there are way better games for that. Especially considering this is a story heavy game, you can't just go and fight as much as you want to.

TLDR; If you're an old fan buy it, if youre a new fan play the first two games, if you're a Monster Hunter fan there are better games to play. This ones a 50/50 for me. I'll give it a thumbs up for Ein.",1671894771,1680373928,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The controls are much more responsive than I feared, making the combat fast, entertaining and spectacular, though as with many other console titles there is a room for improvement for keyboard + mouse. The Devouring attacks feel very satisfying to execute, the ability to dash around the Aragami and through large portions of the stage is awesome.

The stages are beautiful, but unfortunately enclosed and relatively limited. Every mission is somehow timed, which heavily limits the possibility to explore and take everything in. I believe it would do much better as a fully open world, or (I can't believe I'm saying it...), maybe even something souls-like. (Or simply Monster Hunter?)

The character, or rather, weapon type progression system is interesting and allows a player to familiarize themselves with the few combos, which can be modified to result in slightly, or completely different move. The downside is, if you decide to switch weapon type mid-game, all the previous progress is effectively lost.

The story, while not particularly deep, is engaging and full of exciting moments. It follows the player character, a member of an elite military unit tasked with battling monstrous creatures called Aragami that threaten humanity's survival. The plot may be standard fare for the genre, but it's well-executed and provides a solid foundation for the action. And with a cast of likable and memorable characters, I found myself invested in their struggles and triumphs.

The anime references in the game are a major selling point for me as well. From the character designs to the way the cutscenes are presented, it's clear that the developers were big fans of the medium. As someone who has spent countless hours watching and reading anime, it's a joy to see those same elements brought to life in a video game. And with an excellent English voice cast, I can immerse myself in the world without any distractions.

Serious Review:

For context, I have played ""God Eater Resurrection"" and ""God Eater 2 Rage Burst"".

PROS
- Graphics
   > Rationale: This being the newest entry gives a modern feel to the game and makes the old boi Aragami look absolutely stunning. It's like how 720p was the best resolution until 2007 came around and 1080p became the new gold standard (then 2012 changed the scene).

- Gameplay
   > Rationale: Everything felt so absolutely improved since ""God Eater 2 Rage Burst"" when it comes to gameplay. It felt far more intense and with the new big boi Aragami coming to play, it made me feel like - well - an anime character. 

- Aragami
   > Rationale: Balmung be looking real cool. Beat me into a bloody pulp, but honestly getting styled on by a cool looking enemy isn't that bad. New Aragami, new stress levels.

- Lore (Edited in)
   > Rationale: After clearing the last update's content, God Eater 3 is able to be connected because it covers how the Calamity occurred and caused Ash Aragami to appear.

- Story (Edited)
   > Rationale: As far as I am concerned, the story of God Eater 3 does come off as meh and honestly is a hit or miss depending on your own preferences. However, the divide between the Adaptive God Eaters (AGE) and the rest of Humanity is understandable to a degree. The Calamity is a recent memory in the population - so for AGEs (who are closer to Aragami than Human in terms of genetics), they wind up getting the short end of the stick. In the post-game content, it fleshes the world out further while not answering too many questions. Overall, I think the story as it is now is pretty decent.

------------------------------------------------------------------
NEUTRAL

- Lack of Customization for AI Companions
   > Rationale: Let me grace my comrades with the drip. There is a reason why there is a slot for the outfit and couldn't be selected. But if you already like the standard drip for the AI Companions, there isn't much to complain about.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Pros:
- Fanservice
- New Characters
- New Weapons
- New Outfits
- New Aragami
- Faster and much more Fluid Combat System
- New Game-play Mechanics (Dive, Engage, etc)
- 11 Maps, 12 if you include the DLC ""map""
- The Music
- The 2D and 3D Animations

Cons:
- The base story was underwhelming
- The fact that they had to add additional story content to wrap up everything and having to wait for it sucked
- Short battles
- Characters are 2D in personality
- Removed the Blast Gun and turned it into the Ray Gun

God Eater 3 has the worst story in the GE franchise but what it makes up for is the combat, music and characters. Though 2D in personality and whatnot, as the story progressed they were a little more tolerable, when Bandai Namco released their character episodes it felt as though they were no longer 2D characters but someone you could call ""family"". There's also fanservice to soften the blow that was the story such as outfits and a veteran character. 

The aragami have evolved and have become more of a threat than a nuisance, the ashborn are a new type of aragami that can devour the player and enter a burst state and they are scary and annoying when they do devour and enter burst. To make up for the ashborn there are new weapons, the Biting Edge, Heavy Moon and Ray Gun (which replaced the Blast Gun) which were introduced to counter them. Though the battles are way shorter which felt off-putting as a player who has played the other titles, it probably had to do with the new combat system which was good imo.

The music as always was great, though limited to a few songs for battle they added some old favourites as they updated the game.

I played through this game with my brother and we had a great time. This is a good, honest game that has the option of online coop without any of the predatory tricks that characterize modern gaming. (See the video at the bottom of the review for a summary of those.)

Playing this felt a lot like playing [i]Dark Cloud[/i] or one of the other great games from the PS2 era before microtransactions and other tricks ruined gaming except that the graphics were better and I could play online with my brother. There were no login bonuses, no battle pass, no ""loyalty rewards"" no lootboxes, no visual aspects of the game being pay-walled etc. It's just an honest game that's meant to be good.

[h1]Story[/h1]

This has a classic JRPG-type story that is suitable for all ages. Friendship, empathy, and saving people are GOOD!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2907222897

War is bad. Prejudice is bad. Locking painfully cute characters in dungeons just because they are different is also bad (see below).

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2802281965

It's a good, well-intentioned story with a satisfying conclusion which sets it apart from most of the lazy, unfinished trash that passes for entertainment these days.

[h1]Core Gameplay[/h1] 

The mechanics for this Action-RPG/Character Action Game/Spectacle Fighter are fairly deep. This game has lots of jumping and highly mobile combat (its not the comparatively simple, timed dodge-rolling of a soulslike) and it thus fairly fun. A bit less fun is the very deep RPG system with upgrades and crafting, scavenging (be sure to always use a devour attack on an enemy after killing them to get their items) shop NPCs, etc. I managed to make it through the game without every feeling like I had fully mastered the crafting and upgrades... you also upgrade the NPCs in your party of course. 

[h1]Level Design[/h1]

This is NOT an open world; it's my favorite type of game. You have a hub and you have a (very long) series of missions some of which lead to cutscenes which give you plenty of story. You can also replay any mission you have cleared and there are lots of bonus missions and challeng missions as well. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

If you like Earth Defense force you will like this. You will also probably like this if you liked [i]Dark Cloud[/i] or any other classic action RPG. I usually play shooters and soulslikes and I liked it a lot. In fact, I'm kind of surprised that in today's garbage gaming culture, a good, honest game like this even exists. This game is too good for current-year Steam.

They were absolutely correct that it does get better and very addicting too.  To all MH fanboys out there yes God Eater 3 trumps your precious Monster Hunter games because unlike your games God Eater takes you right into the action without all of the boring non essential dialogues from non important NPCs.  

God Eater does a great job of keeping you informed of what's going on and the character bonding is really real in that sense of the way where you begin to form some sort of connection with the characters that you encounter and recruit onto your AGES team.

For me GodEater 3's story was the strongest in the series. Right away you are young adults being used by shadowy ambitious overseers. Other people around you treat you like prisoners or disposable cannon-fodder. As a result of this you become very loyal to the first mission supervisor whom shows you actual kindness. It's a hard-knock-life out there even with any familiar anime tropes you recognize still intact. Imagine if Fallout and Kingdom hearts had a love-child then raised it to be a little bit like Monster hunter. There you go! (More or less)

The Arigami you are forced to fight for ""The greater good of all mankind"" are like the kaiju from Japanese ""big monster"" films. There's a scientific explanation on how they are made of a bunch of symbiotic sentient cells that exist to devour and assimilate anything around them. This is why many Arigami look as if they have both organic and mechanical properties.
It also explains why many locales you fight in appear to be ravaged wastelands. 

Additionally your weapon that can transform into a melee weapon,shield,or a huge cannon is made of modified genetic material from those very same behemoths you are facing. Naturally this procedure is not 100% safe nor devoid of dire consequences but in such a desperate situation there's not much more you can do about it. 

Overall the above makes for a rather intriguing setting and this is complimented  by presenting you with a cast of likable endearing characters! God-Eater Burst had done this well too and the reason I beat it on the PSP was in part due to to being invested in the personal struggles/character growth of my team-mates. 

Let me make something clear. I don't consider myself a ""super fan"" of the series. There are gamers whom think the previous God-Eater entries had a better bullet-forging crafting system or that God Eater 3's predecessors were more challenging and rewarding. There is ""truth' to
those caveats.

However,I appreciated the much more fast and flowy combat,wider variety of god-arks, and more forgiving pace whenever I was forced to contend with the Arigami threat. Don't misunderstand me,you still have to learn the elemental and weapon-type weaknesses of each Arigami. Things have not been watered down so much this is the ""Dynasty Warriors on easy-mode"" of God-Eater. Rather it is simply your main character has more options and can move more fluidly whether on the ground or in mid-jump.

Some people have also complained about the AI of your team-mates but overall I was able to work around any annoyances and never was hindered too badly by this. Still, it is annoying when your allies glitch out on a piece of terrain or outright ignore you as your ""death clock"" gradually ticks down! (Fortunately even if you are not tagged back in immediately you get a few 'continues"" which allow you to respawn anyway!)

Namco Bandai has gotten increasingly better at their formula of lovable misfits going up against insurmountable odds. I appreciate how they don't shy away from mature or uncomfortable subject-matter and God-Eater 3 lives up to that standard.


Pros

+Interesting lore and world building

+Arigami as a concept are intriguing and terrifying

+Likable characters

+Fast and fun combat

+A better selection of god arks (Weaponry)

+Much improved character creator

+New Arigami

+Realistic themes of older generations using younger generations to accomplish their own selfish ends (You will own nothing,be happy,and eat ze bugz!)

Cons

-Bullet crafting has been gradually nerfed more and more as the series went on.

You could even customise your companions playstyle based on their personality and if you've got a friend it can be a good time.  The Aragamis are very rewarding to fight as you fight them multiple times you learn their patterns & behaviour and you improve.

My gripes with it is the camera wasn't taken into account when designing the Aragamis and their combat encounter. Most Aragamis are very agile just dash all over the screen, it's somewhat manageable in open spaces but in enclosed arenas, you can't keep up with them, even the camera can't keep up with them. The worst is when you are fighting in an enclosed arena you just take damage (Aragami does huge damage) without even seeing what is happening and sometimes get trapped in a corner exacerbating the whole thing.

gameplay regarding combat character development and party management ... 3/10
as much as it pains me to admit it.. this games mechanics are just garbage.. if you like the story your in for a treat its a classic with all the nostalgia of an old school action rpg.. but the game play is just absolute trash chalked full of blatant artificial difficulty and sloppily designed combat mechanics...
i dont know where this trend stared but its presence has definitely mad a terrible impact even on games like this that you would think devs just couldnt screw up on.. lol well they will prove you wrong if you play this in hopes that its not the case xD...
so the main one youll notice after about 20 hours or so.. you never gain any real levels... you never get more health or defense or any way to increase them in any significant manner.. now you can spend your allies ap to level their stats up.. but not your own.. which youd think could ballance out by learning the trashy mechanics that clearly have serious hit box issues ... but thats not the case.. they ruin any chance of that by making enemies that will non stop spam aoe attacks at the player that cant be dealth with but by blocking or staying on the run.. which means you either get the crap beat out of your shield the whole fight or just run.. you never get to combo enemies past a certain point .. which just makes the combat part of the game feel extremely boring and disappointing!",1670188236,1670188236,False,0,3,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

but its fun...
weirdly.

lets see

yea no ok . same issue as monster hunter. Bad motion telegraphs. the monster will stand there in attack from but you can't tell if it will attack now or 5 secs later. So its like you to put a pause on your battle until the attack is done. 
same niche toxic rabid dog ""Fans"". Same git gud. Same no no-hit runs to show for. 
man no hit runs really shut you the fuck up or instantly show the games nonsense. I was looking at team hitless and i went ""hades no hit run? wtf i thought that was a shit game"" and i loaded up a run to look at and as it was loading i was thinking ""wow , this is it , i am the shitter player. Proof. nice. I'll get to see a real good run. learn. Play well. enjoy the game i paid for finally cause who the fuck buys a game only to waste it by giving it a negative review"" 
and the dude either 1 hit koed all the mobs or cheesed them. And for bosses well... It went SO SLOW and it was always. do MASSIVE damage with your overpowered character that's already beaten the game and then as soon as they even slightly move. gtfo . not in time. No i-frame. not even ""last moment"" . simply. gtfo . run. 
as soon as it comes to no hit run all these fuckers RUN to their ranged weapon.
meanwhile dark souls no hit run RULE.. states no ranged weapon , no block , no parry

this game the motherfuckers didn't even ATTEMPT it. 

hmm... 
BUT
but
it works like dmc. (even tho dmc 3 HAD A NO HIT RUN MODE AND HAD GOOD ASS TELEGRAPHS AND THERE IS A NO HIT RUN SSS RANK PLAYLIST YOU FUCKS) you play it for fun moveset
plus always 3 AI. AND you can get back into the fight in an instant. no more ""sorry master im a bad player let me huddle and cower in a corner for 50secs while i heal up so i can think through what a bad boy i am bohohoohohoho yes it is my fault it is a bad game"" 

I can't lose 1 more game as a bad game COME ON . Im paying . isn't that enough. 
This is supposed to be my happiness . The thing i work for in life. other than food ofc but who cares when good food is expensive and doesn't fill up your stomach AND leaves you bored as fuck. Or bad food you want to vomit the moment you put it in your mouth but you have to shove in your mouth and throat fuck yourself with to survive the next day.... so that OTHERS aren't put in a problem because you are hungry or fainted or can't focus.. to get money to do that shit ALL over again. 
and to state the obvious.. if you are just living to earn for your next meal you might as well become a street dog

Everyone can have a hobby.. but my hobby starts with everyone being ridiculed because you like something... by  slaves who essentially shutdown after school/office and talk about the same damn thing like nps. Then whores acting like comfort woman by pretending to like it to scam and idiots actually thinking its true? what? Then scum who like to think of themselfs as businessmen come in and fuck shit up , take a company built by creators and throw it to the sales team. 
And then normies in come in act like they like it.. change it.. and throw away anyone who liked it.
And then when you complain about it.... They label you as an outcast AGAIN ... guess what happens when someone reads this.. they laugh... and what's the counter??... To NEVER speak of it. talk about checkmate

this is just a hobby
they did this shit to the fucking SCIENCE community. ""Overthink"" ""lol so boring i dont wanna hear"" 
Its a wonder we still advance as a species..HOW... how do we have people working on fission reactors that are nearly endless when we have dumb fucks who will take what they have and make them outcasts again
HOW did we even get to the point of ""WE revolve around the sun"" when they staked and burnt the first man who said it.

What is my hobby in front of this ..caveman behaviour. 
yet i must complaint. 
scream in the void. cause there is a review button and just like the comments on youtube. or selfies on instagram.
You don't do it. but once you try. you can't go back can you.

but just in case this helps 1 person not buy it. Im glad

the dumbasses who are entertained by fidge spinners get to use socials to get into everyones personal life and destroy it. 

now. to try all weapons finish this and see if i like it.. despite its bullshit
maybe bandai namco isn't fucking Capcom.
the opening is cool
maybe i enjoy it as a story game! 

its worse than mh... how.? 
even without attacking. i can't dodge it cause i dont know what the fuck the mosnter does. and its not a matter of speed either. 
i wish they just gave up on having windups in the first place.
Then i wouldn't have to get messed up. 
The way they want you to play seems to be so boring and messed up

you could force the game at 0.25 speed and they couldn't come up with a no hit run. there will be 1 anomaly dude and his gameplay (lets be real) will just about jumping 1 sec before there is even a windup. 

but now im kinda invested in phym. And claire the titties. And dual blade figure hottie. but mainly the story and wil hugo be able to get his dream. fuck zeke.

Yea. The people in the japan game dev are the ones who couldn't cut it in the anime industry but still dream of somehow making an anime.. 
failures who can't handle 1 genre come to world' favourite punching bag and try to corrupt that just so than can make an anime....:D or atleast close to what they can make .
:D :D :D .
Even for the opening they had to call the real people. Ufotable :D :D 

and thats the only good thing in this entire 20gb software mess

this game.. playing it makes you feel lesser.
And the worst part is it keeps throwing SSS rank as if you did something

thank the fucking gods its finally fucking over. 
it could have been an email. It could have been an anime.
fuck the dlc/extra shit. I didn't pay for dlc and i salvaged as much as i could for the stuff i paid
plus i just googled it . so tht's done. 1 series of finding a new monster. 5 1-off missions about learning people's past. and challenge missions like filler but more difficult. 
didnt pay for it. was free. So who fucking cares. it extra and DLC in other games already feels like i asked for a second helping of ""please saw my leg off with a dull sawblade while stabing my eye with a pen thank you very much what a Privilege"" 

why the fuck do these shit games have to have godly music


fuck bandai namco. They ever since astro boy's toy success they have been a cumslave to anime adaptations.
how they got lucky with fromsoft.. only god knows
fucking namco as well. The fuckers made pac man...wait.... and tekken and then its weaker part soul calibure
and then nothing worth noticing since 1996 or something.

Story: 6/10
+ Run around destroyed cities, always feeling like your life is on the line. 
+ The general theme of GE3 is “human experiments trying to earn their freedom and rights as human beings in a post-apocalyptic world where people will do anything to survive.”
- Like GE1/2, the story gets stuck in the “hub world -> maybe cutscene -> mission -> maybe cutscene -> back to hub world” loop. Story progression being triggered by missions starting/ending can undercut the peril the story is trying to convince you of.
~ In the hub world, you do get some additional dialog options or cutscenes when you talk to NPCs, and even scenes mid-mission, or mission-end fakeouts. However, they don’t happen nearly enough. Sometimes it only happens once, and then never again…
- “Post-mission hangouts” and character-driven side quests that lead to new NPC abilities (from GE1/2) are gone.
~ Actually, there are character-driven side quests that grant additional abilities and let you get more backstory, but it’s … end game content!? What!?
+ GE1/2 had issues with stretching out the story to make the game longer. GE3 actually values your time. 

Characters: 7/10
+ Character designs are top notch, and the over-sexualization is … still there. But maybe not as bad as GE1/2.
~ Outfits are very well designed, but GE1/2 had 10x the variety.
- We don’t get much character development for non-major characters during the main story.
- Or if we do, it’s introduced clumsily with no build-up and immediately forgotten.
+ Again, we get more character development later, but ... man, it would have been so much better if it actually happened during the main story.
++ Phym (the little monster girl) is wonderfully done, and almost makes up for all the other shortcomings. She’ll follow you around the hub world like a lost puppy, mimic your emotes, and in general just tug on your heartstrings and be cute.
+++ As Phym learns to speak Japanese better over the course of the story, she actually gets new in-battle voice lines. Twice, even, so there’s three “levels of Phym speaking Japanese correctly.” The devs didn’t have to do that, but it makes me very happy that they did.

Music: 9/10
+ Beautifully orchestrated, absolutely epic soundtrack. In a “die at any moment” kind of world, the soundtrack is exceedingly apt.
- If I hadn’t played GE1/2, I would have given the music a higher score. Since I have, though, I can’t help but notice there’s fewer overall tracks than in previous games, and I also miss the rock / techno / dubstep tracks from the old games (despite how silly some of them were).
+ The old music is available, and you can set the mission music to random. Try it out!

Audio: 9.5/10 
+ From weapons clanging and blasting, to monsters wailing, to chirping crickets creating ambiance, to the sounds of your boots hitting the various types of ground, the sound design is absolutely stellar. 
+ The Japanese voice cast killed it. The call-outs during combat, and the performances during cutscenes are all top quality, and filled with personality. 
- Nitpick: GE1/2 had multiple radio operators. Kind of miss having that variety.

Gameplay: 8.5/10
+ It’s like a faster-paced Monster Hunter. An action RPG where you choose a melee weapon, a gun, and a shield, and hack, slash and blast away. There’s an assortment of skills and other mechanics that unlock over time, which keep things interesting. It’s challenging, but forgiving. You may die, but you can be revived by your teammates (but only so many times). 
- While it is overall forgiving, some of the enemy attacks and timings are downright brutal, maybe even a little unfair. That is, until you realize that the correct strategy is ""literally just run away,""
+ Combat somehow feels both snappy and weighty. Seriously, the animations in the game are incredible. Movement feels fast, but still so fluid and connected. Swinging giant weapons takes some time and planning (though not as much as Dark Souls), and the hits feel satisfyingly devastating. Definitely a step up from previous titles, which were pretty solid to begin with.
~ Enemy hitbox targeting is slightly worse in this iteration. Maybe it’s because the old games were designed for smaller screens and lower resolutions, and this game is overall faster, but it’s trickier to actually hit those weak points. It’s still pretty forgiving, though; you don’t have to land all your hits perfectly, and your teammates are definitely helpful.
- My only other real complaint is the gun weapons. The animations everywhere else are so good, but using a giant shotgun or sniper rifle gives so little feedback it feels weak, even though it's definitely doing damage.
~ Previous games stretched out the story so much the gameplay became stale. This game stays fresh, if only because it doesn’t do that. Grinding for weapon upgrade materials feels more forgiving, too. However, there's still no hiding that this game is a mission-based arena fighter, despite trying to appear otherwise. 
+ Just wanted to throw in another + because, while the number of stages you fight on is limited, they did include a random day/night and weather system, and it adds a surprising amount of variety that the previous games were missing.",1665374116,1665440286,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a lot to customize in this game. You can select 3 AI partners and add 4 passive skills to them. In battle those allies help a lot.

You can choose one of the 8 melee weapon types, one of the 4 ranged weapon types and one of the 3 shield types. Each type has ~20 different variants which have different passive bonuses, elements and amount of slots for passive abilities. You can collect and insert passive abilities into both weapons and shield. On top of that you can customize three of your attacks with special bonuses which activate after you devour an enemy, so if you like using a heavy attack after dodge you can improve it to be more effective. You can even add some special effects to those attacks like sending several waves of energy after each hit.

And that is not all customization. You can also get a special ability which activates under certain conditions, like ""heal 5 hp per second for 10 seconds after blocking 70 damage with a shield"". And you can customize your bullets with several special effects and mechanics - bomb, rotating, healing, range, spread, etc.

Each large enemy has 3 points which can be destroyed to temporarily stun an enemy and weaken him till the end of the battle (either reducing defense or removing some attack or movement ability). Chapter bosses have very dangerous ability that significantly reduces amount of times you can recover in battle and at the same time it boosts them for a while.

The amount of battles is overwhelming. They are all ""destroy some monsters in this small area"". Still it allows you to enjoy using those many weapons and skills that you learn while fighting those monsters a lot.",1665349938,1665349938,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story feels unpolished and lacks something in it. Combat is cool and all but that quickly sinks that you don't feel a challenge after few missions. 

If you want some easy grind game with an anime style in it, I guess this game is perfect for you.

But if you think that ""Oh this looks cool and difficult at the same time"". Yea no, honestly CODE: Vein and Monster Hunter games feel a lot more challenging. And actually it feels rewarding that you finally managed to beat the impossible just to meet another monster to ruin your day.

What initially got me interested in this game was when he was watching me play Kingdom Hearts 3 and he told me that the battle style reminded him of God Eater 3. And now that I have played the game, I can see where he may have thought that, but if anything the combat is more similar to NieR:Automata than KH3. The game is surprisingly fun, and even better to play with friends! You are actually able to progress through the campaign in multi-player and do the missions together, which is something I have never really seen in a game before.

One complaint that I do have is that keyboard and mouse controls feel slow and clunky, and it's just not convenient. I'd recommend playing this game with a controller. The game only supports XBOX controls, but if you go into Steam Big Picture mode, and configure the controller yourself, it should be fine. (My friend and I use a Switch controller, and while I didn't have to configure mine because I'm used to where the buttons would be on an XBOX controller, he is used to playing the game on Switch, so he had to mess with his controller configuration a little bit).

Other than that, I have no complaints! It's a great game with really good character customization and an even better combat system. I'd recommend this game to someone who likes the combat in KH or NieR:Automata.",1664832353,1664832582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+The gameplay loop is super fun. Now at first I thought I could just be playing monster hunter but to those who think this game is discount monster hunter, you should definitely look at this game differently. It's type of grind isn't as focused on getting mats by breaking specific parts (although it is still part of the game) but rather leveling up your many things like burst arts and your acceleration triggers.

+On that note the dam customization in this game is really good. Now again I will compare it to monster hunter where in that game you equip different pieces of armor and a weapon + you get your item loadout with you. This game doesn't have armor but rather you have 3 different equippables (melee, gun, shield) and you get to pick 3 different burst arts and install different skills in each of the equippables. There is a lot of customization going on in this game. You can even equip abilities on the NPC allies you have.

+For the actual gameplay, the hunts are a bit too short for my liking but they are still really fun. One thing I do want to talk aobut is the dam movement is actually quite fun. Jumping and diving are really enjoyable and make traversing very quick. The fact that you can have both a melee and a range weapon equipped is very neat. It is also nice to always have the ability to shield (although I just equipped tower shield and face tanked everything).

+The maps are small and its very quick to the point. You don't have to take 10 years searching for monsters as they are just marked on your map. This may be a minus for some people who really enjoy just exploring the world but if you just want quick hunts it is definitely much better than taking a whole minute to reach your first big monster.

+I personally really liked the weapon choices in this game. I personally used the heavy moon in this game and oh man it is so fun. I was just slicing monsters and suddenly my thing turns into a dam scythe, switch axe style. Very sick. I can't super talk about the rest of the weapons but when I did look at videos of the other weapons' gameplay, they all looked fun in their own way. The burst arts of heavy moon were just too fun.

+Of course monster hunter players love fashion hunting and this game has some really nice outfits. Since there are no armor pieces, this game definitely has less combinations than monster hunter but you still get to farm for cosmetics in this game.

+It is hard to really focus on it but the soundtrack of this game is pretty good. Not the most standout but tracks like Tomorrow Ties are quite hype.

-The story was a slog and too melodramatic and predictable. I mean luckily you can just skip the cutscenes but if you are playing this game for a story, you won't have a fun time.

-There may be a big quantity of missions but dam they all are the same hunt the big monster in this small map. It did feel a bit too repetitive at one point so it is hard to play this game for too long compared to other games.

-For a 2019 game, this game looks like it was made in 2015. I will admit the design of the monsters were quite nice but visually the game does look dated.

-Honestly I barely used the gun. The gun didn't feel necessary at all in my gameplay and I'm pretty sure I had like 2% gun usage in my card.

-The biggest problem with the gameplay itself is how awful the camera is in this game. Some of the worst lock-on I have seen in these types of games.

-Navigating the hub to find who you need to talk to for progression is super annoying. It doesn't help that the loading screens take 10 years.

-Why can't you reach burst lvl 3 solo...

Definitely not as good as monster hunter but at least it was fun.",1662781778,1662781932,True,21,0,0.727651894092559814,0,True,False,False

If you are looking for a Monster Hunter style game I would not look here. This games suffers from a lot of camera and all around monster mechanic issues. If you're looking for a game with anime tropes and at least a fun story. I would wait for a sale.

The camera is super slow or super fast, no in between. And if you get stuck between a monster and a wall good luck as the monster is invisible so you cannot see what it is doing...

The monster mechanics are... interesting.. some have no counter and there is very little to no read before they do anything. Also they have a lot of moves that utilize a 360 AoE attack and requires you to just get away... At least MonHun has it so the mosnters attacks are telegraphed a little more obvious so its easier to tell when to dodge what. 

Also there is no ""dodge"" or invincibility frames like Monster Hunter. You're either in the way or out, but as I stated before a lot of monster utilize a cone or 360 attack pattern so its harder to evade. They give you a shield but I found it easier to maintain uptime on burst and just double jump out of the way most of the time.

all in all I did have a good time but there are a lot of things in this game that did make it frustrating. One is that the smaller monsters are actually harder to fight than the larger monsters. There's like one particular ashborn i had issues with but the rest were cake..

Overview; 60hrs to 100% the achieves, probably could have been less if I didnt switch weapons frequently in the beginning. Story is a usual anime 8/10 for me as i am a sucker for these types of tropes.

The gameplay loop seems to go as following: you and your team are dropped of at the start of the map, beat up some monsters (button mash until they die), and then you get teleported back. Along the way you're supposed to grab some random items from the floor.

For a game set in a dystopian world, none of the characters act like they have gone through a lot. All of their personality has been dumped by cliches and tropes which breaks the purpose of having a post apocalyptic world. For starters, your character and his/her partners throughout the game has no depth at all aside for being disposable prisoners but the game does not explain how you got into that situation in the first place. I've gone through a point where I just skip dialogue and cutscenes just so I could beat up monsters. The villain on this game are also disposable. its like you're watching dora the explorer but swiper keeps on changing per episode. The threat of the ash or whatever they are running from is just dumped as information as an opening to the game but you don't see any people dying, getting affected, or even being endangered by the said ash. same with ash aragamis, these creatures should be the bane of existence for the game as the game tells you that ""get hit by one of them, you die"". However it became a hollow threat cause they never explained how the corruption shit works. To make it worse, it introduced an immediate counter for said corruption so the threat in them are gone aside from looking like a badass. So for people who will buy this game for the plot, just don't.

Who cares about plot anyways, this game is all about that gameplay right? well, the gameplay's entertaining for the first 100 mission then it becomes stale at the end. For reference: Before dropping the game, I finished half of rank 6 and killed all 5 ash aragamis. I know that there are more challenging foes ahead, but this game bored the fuck out of me. 

Lets start where they got shit right. The enemy design, the design of the monsters are undeniably gorgeous. they feel like a threat once you see them and the physiology of the enemies are thought out well like the aligator with a turbine in its back in which spins when it produces electricity. The combat is very fluid and I did not feel any clunkiness with my character's movement. It is perfect for a game that's catered for a more fast paced monster hunter game. The burst mechanic is also a merit as it changes the gameplay of your weapon. this makes it so that you have a lot of playstyle to explore within a weapon so that it offers variety for 1trick ponies out there. The game also makes that you need to devour so that you maintain this form, but devouring makes you vulnerable, it is a high risk-high reward mechanic that keeps the gameplay satisfying.

Now I've said every positive thing in this game so its time to shit on it. 


The game is repetitive. It does not take 5 hours into the game for them to reuse another monster with changed element and 1 or 2 more moveset added to their arsenal. The game is not hard at all. Most of enemy hits are telegraphed and their moveset is very limited.

 Having companions break the game as well since they are so tanky, they take aggro from the enemy, they heal you, and they deal damage as well. 90% of the enemies in my playthrough (halfway of rank 6) I did not even bother to learn their movesets, openings and weaknesses, I just spam them for 1minute and 30 seconds and they die.

The way that they design the burst and how to increase them is frustrating. In this game, you can burst through devouring but you can only level it up to level 3 by using special rounds you get from devouring.You then need to link with teamate which is available after an amount of time passes by. After linking, you need to use the rounds to your teamate so that you can also upgrade your burst level. In a fast paced game like this, your teamates tend to colide with each other's models which makes your aim assisted burst rounds act wild and it even sometimes target the ally behind your back. It is very frustrating and leveling your burst from 1-3 does not give a significant advantage apart from the passives that is given your gun, shield, and weapon. It is annoying that I need to deal with it so that I could efficiently hunt the monster. But as I've said, The game is made for 10 yr old kids so you could ignore this mechanic through your entire playthrough. 

The game Gets harder when the enemies that spams projectiles without any telegraphs are introduced. There are certain enemies that spam projectiles that deals a lot of damage and can hardly even be seen. Sometimes, it appears that your character model is out of the hitbox but it will still clip you and deal a lot of damage. Most of my downs are given by enemies that has this one shot abilities that has no wind up at all (usually in ash aragami fights). Ash aragamis have the potential to go on a burst mode when they devour and hit someone, like the players do. This mechanic is interesting since the enemies are also taking risks so that they could power up like the players. But, they transition to burst regardless of who they hit. about 80% of the time that an ash aragami goes into burst in my playthrough, comes from my AI Teamate getting hit, not me. This is so frustrating that I had to hunt solo missions after rank 4 since I could not take the frustration of playing well and still getting punished by it. Removing your teamates makes the game hard since there are scenarios that they spawn small mobs around the target or the game just straight up gives you 2 large enemies at the same time.

Overall this game has its problems to the mechanic, game design, world building, and most importantly, plot. But I would be lying if I tell that I did not enjoy the first few hours of this game.

and most of it isn't even rebindable.

R1 is dash + other functions (R1+X or Y is special attacks)
A is both the quick step, and the interact key
but if you press A while dashing, nothing happens. you don't quick step, and you don't interact either.

healing items are used by pressing start, and THEN sorting through all the crap you have on hand to find the one item you need, and then press X to use it.
you can't do anything except walk around while you have the item menu open.

R2 is ONLY used for dash, and it's R2+X for some reason.
R2 does nothing else, just the dash.
why do you have to press 2 buttons for this? if it was going to be used this way, why didn't they map the rest of the buttons too? this could have been a good place to access healing items.
R2 + d-pad to use an item from a quick slot would have been good.

and worst of all is the d-pad, it is used to zoom the camera in and out verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry slowwwwwwwwwwwly.
I have used this button exactly 0 times while playing this game from start to finish.

the controls are absolutely horrid, they don't make any sense.
it was most likely made by a person who never played any video games that came out after the ps2 released.


and the enemy hitboxes are so bad, they swing a moderately large sword vaguely at your direction, and you will get hit no matter where you are.
actually, it doesn't even have to be swinging at your direction, you could be standing behind him while he swings, and you'd still get hit.
there comes a point where you just give up trying, and you just stand there spamming attacks, giving zero shits if you're hit or not.
which actually turns out to be a viable strategy since all the enemies die in less than 5 minutes anyway, and they usually just get stunlocked to death.

even if somehow you manage to die, you have a grand total of 12 retries per mission.
it is physically impossible to fail.

The visuals are so nice, coupled with a crisp 60FPS(?), borderless window, dual audio (ENG and JP voices which you can change on the main menu at anytime) and [spoiler] boob jiggle physics [/spoiler]. 

Gameplay wise has been drastically improved, with new mechanics such as the engage system which allows AI teammates to utilize special abilities i.e: improved defense, shared item effects, etc. They also improved visuals and sounds for Aragamis, animations, attacks, and even added in idle animations. Another thing they added in as a nice quality of life is on the mission overview screens, usually the Aragami you're going to fight will have its elemental weaknesses displayed in the window to help with figuring out what loadout to bring. Overall the combat system feels a lot more fluid and refreshing compared to the previous GE games. 

The only drawbacks I currently see were they removed the hit system to indicate if an attack is effective and replaced it with coloured damage values. Another problem is if you play a gunner role, they limit you to a maximum of 6 bullets and 4 custom bullets with no Oracle Point generating bullets like in GE:R and GE2. 

As for visuals: only minor things I have with God Eater 3 is the copious amount of black tape everyone has [spoiler] which may have awakened a tape fetish for me [/spoiler], as well as the classic anime hair clipping through clothes.

I honestly felt like this series hit its stride in the 2nd installment, and clearly the rest of the budget went towards the particle effects and flashy visuals that constantly clog up the screen and make it impossible to tell what's happening from moment to moment.  

The item menu is extremely clunky, the guns are nigh useless, there's no reason to equip anything but what has the Largest Number, too many attacks from the monsters feel like they were designed for a completely different game with a much faster combat loop - with the combat in this game being lethargic to an extreme - and wind up feeling cheap/provoke a lot of ""What hit me?!"" moments, even the camera and lock-on feels stiff and awkward to use.  

It's just not a good-feeling game.

Pros: 

• Story - I know a handful of people rag on how awful the story is lol; I can't say a lot without spoiling too much but I was engaged throughout the entire main arc/s (?).  It's still pretty corny but that's to be expected honestly and I'm a sucker for that. 

• Characters - The only one I really like is Hugo and I think that's mostly because the game does feature him and MC together probably 80% of the time. Throughout the whole game, he's the only one who I feel has the best connection with MC, which is understandable since they grew up together. In all of the GE games I've played, he has become my favorite.  I like Phym too, not as much as Hugo sadly, but I really like parent/child dynamic because it's so wholesome. To me, Hugo and Phym are the only characters that made me feel that the MC is really involved with them as friends/ family. 


• Missions / Combat - I'm not a completionist so I don't have much to say for the other optional missions that get up there in difficulty so I will comment on the story missions. Compared to the amount of filler missions in GE2RB, this game has very little of that -- maybe too little. Combat felt better -- it felt more natural and I did enjoy the new weapons added. 

Cons:

• Story - The length is probably my biggest gripe for the game. Main story ends at Rank 7, around 20 hours in, and that's with me doing random optional quests. Maybe this was intended and that the bulk of the time you'll put into this game is the grinding aspect after finishing the main story but that is not something I personally enjoy since they can only be done after you finish the story. 

• Customization - It looks like a lot but there's just bunch of variants where some gloves are added, the cape is removed, the length of the coat is shorter, etc.  Anyways, this is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect the gameplay at all but I enjoyed the clothing selection more in GE2RB. 

• Characters - Apart from the two I've mentioned in pros, the rest don't feel fleshed out enough and that's the best way I can put it. I don't feel the familial bond they keep hyping up with Claire, Zeke, Lulu, etc. I feel like for the most part, they're just... there.  In the cutscenes, they interact with the MC on a minimal level; it's mostly Hugo and Phym who acknowledges your presence. I feel the least attached to Lulu specifically in the entire main story. I haven't done her Traversing the Past quest yet so maybe that will help. Kind of bummed they took out the mail system, I enjoyed reading the random messages the NPCs would send you in the past games.

• Missions - There are a bunch of challenges to do after the main story but it is not my cup of tea. Most of the optional missions just feel soulless especially since the main story ends a bit too quickly in my opinion and they add little to nothing to the story anymore (except for the Extra Episodes which I did like.)  I wish they could've made the character episodes available again so we could build better relationships with the other characters while doing more missions.

Overall, I did really enjoy the game -- maybe the nostalgia is playing a huge part in it. GE2RB felt like a chore to play sometimes but I never had that feeling while I was playing GE3.  There aren't many games that glue me to my seat anymore but this managed to and maybe that's why the story felt shorter than it actually was.

Hugo being the absolute chad he is also helped in making me decide the verdict lol. Recommended.",1655851040,1655851458,True,6,0,0.578723430633544922,0,True,False,False

Elements are a lot better in this game too, and the way you craft weapons you end up being encouraged to try different weapons by crafting an element that you need for your next (or previously failed) hunt. 

Haven't beaten it yet so I can't say anything about the end game, it could be awful, a meat grinder or easy, couldn't tell you, but the Rank 5 missions are a noticable increase in difficulty from the previous.

Disclaimer I got this on sale for 10 bucks, so MAJOR bang for your buck on sale. I don't think it's worth the full 60 USD especially since its tough finding players online, which can make the Assault missions extremely hard (but they do give you some bots but they're pretty meh on their dps, so you really need to go try hard mode to solo these)

At the end of the day, cool weapon designs that you just love to play with and the combos feel very powerful and satisfying. Only weapon I don't like so far is the Biting Edge as it really doesn't gel well with this entries new mechanics and it misses 90 percent of the time.

Was in the mood for a anime themed hack'N'slash and saw it had Very Positive reviews.
After playing it for 5 hours, I can say, ""not for me!"" and ""now i regret selling my Wii U & Bayonetta 2!""

I come from the perspective of having played Dark Souls series, God Hand, Bayonetta and Vanquish.
I'm a big fan of those games and remember them fondly.
I don't like God Eater, for the following reasons:

- The lock on system doesn't work as expected: I'm used to the auto lock on system of games such as the above, and while this game does have a lock on function, it only serves to keep the camera focused on the enemy that is locked on... your attacks still have to be aimed manually. This is like Monster Hunter -- I didn't like it in MH and I don't like it here. My attacks will often miss. Any kind of rushing attack will usually put me on the wrong side of an enemy, with our back to each other.
This results in very sloppy combat.

- Maybe to compensate for the imprecise combat control, the game is far too easy. Only some timed missions offer any challenge. Certain bosses will knock you on your ass with their fast movement and unpredictable attacks, but this is more annoying than threatening. Missions are also far too short. The player needs to bite the enemy with an Eater attack, so they can upgrade their special moves by using them, or use certain move repeatedly to activate (and thus upgrade) an Accelerator mode... but it is hard to do these things when everything dies before you have a chance to use these advanced techniques.

- Starting New Game, I immediately received a pile of free weapons, items and costumes. This removes incentive to play and earn rewards. I have the impression I am using someone else's New Game+ save file.

- Between the technobabble and in-universe lingo in the cutscenes and the myriad of mechanics and combat controls, this game tries to nerd out by piling on detail, but that doesn't make it better -- it just ends up being obtuse and boring. Being so easy, i never bothered with the crafting system, and just used the weakest weapons.

- Very cheesy dialogue and fabulous costume design -- animu, am I right? Some of the outfits are Jojo level; this is a matter of taste. The story isn't terrible by any means. Having it forced onto the player is... You are required to interact with all NPCs with [...] dialog bubbles between missions, before entering the new mission.

- So far, all battles take place on the same map, (""Melted Cathedral"") despite the overworld map suggesting you are travelling over a larger territory. Targets even appear in the same spots. So copy and paste design makes it repetitive and boring. Perhaps the producer had a choice between having multiple very large, bland environments like the Armored Core series, or having one very beautiful, detailed map.

In closing, I would like You to leave with my control config for the XBox controller, it took me a long time to find a configuration that made sense to me. The control customization is a plus point for this game, and one of the aspects I enjoyed the most. I switch between games a lot, so I get to enjoy my neuro-plasticity...

-there seems to be a very limited amount of monster / boss variation. none of the designs of the monsters are memorable or even seem intimidating

In fact this game is pretty much the same as the first two games, just slightly better in terms of graphics, character animtion and it's even a little better balanced. There's still some things they have not improved, like there's still no good way to fight flying enemies. Jumping around and getting a few hits in is just not very engaging, adding grabs or being able to land on the enemy and stab them from above would be a lot cooler. There are still some encounters with multiple enemies at once and they are not very good, since they all focus on the player no matter how stealthy your build is (because you're pretty much the one doing all the damage).

Although the story is not great or even really good, I enjoyed a lot and it had some really wholesome bits. Overall it's the best game in the series, but there is still a lot of room for improvement.

I don’t play previous GE games, even though I made artwork of previous GE character and I have the games on my library, I don’t play those. Hopefully my review is still considerably an honest opinion of newbie.
If you don’t wanna read wall of text then TL:DR.. I have my conclusion on the bottom of this review.

Pros:

Story and mission
Sadly there is nothing I can say about the story for sake of avoiding any spoiler. I know nothing about the plot on previous game so.. I would rather not misinform anyone nor do I want to ruin the surprise for new player. I feel like there is some kind mismatch between what is presented on cutscene and what player is dealing in mission. Although I can tell so much that the game is intended to have player focused on gameplay mechanic. The story is just great addition to make player empathizing with the NPCs. My personal favourite are Hugo and Ein.

Graphic
It’s beautiful anime based graphic in post-apocalyptic setting, I especially love the animation during cutscene, how my character moves and interactes with other npc (Well some of them, at least). There was moment I spent time to roam around enjoying the scenery. If only this game has photo mode..

Equipment and moveset (burst art) 
Unique weapon and moveset, and I am emphasizing on heavy moon, biting edge, and scythe. Maybe double swords in itself is not new thing but have you ever seen one transformed into double side glaive? It’s still unique concept, as unique as moon-shaped weapon that transformed into huge arse axe. Also(my personal favourite) the scythe, and no, it’s not just ordinary scythe, it grows in length!
There are several weapons to choose each with unique burst arts, combined with three different type of guns (in unique function) and three type of armor (in different defense and speed). Player is given their freedom to choose all the style in their preference.

Music
Beautiful epic song composed Masaru Shiina-sensei, nuff said.

Customization
As gamer focusing on games with customization, I don’t really have high standard for it, but I can say for certain that it has decent variety of character face both for male and female character…it’s not huge selection but enough to make unique character. 

Fashion
I am not sure what the appeal with flex tape on fabric but hey.. Each to their own. It is still part of artistry and creativity. I can only assume it was intended immersion, I mean... If I am living in world invaded by microorganism alien, I would use anything to fix my clothes (yes even flex tape).

Party Member
I love that player gets to decide what skill to put on the npc thus effecting their role in battle. Everyone of them has their own gimmick… engage effect at the very least.
Sadly none of the npc is comparable to fully fortified character avatar.

Battle Mechanic
New player might find it annoying. I myself have my share of frustration from dying over and over at first but after spending lot of ingame time, I have come to realize that this game is all about timing and learning enemy pattern. Personally I find it satisfying to perform perfect guard on every aragami.

Multiplayer
I know this is a gaming cliché of ‘Literally any game is better with friends’ but GE3 co-op is all about helping other player and I think it is positive aspect of the game. Player has to do assault mission to unlock engage, and it is faster to do with other player. When I join a room with someone with less story than my character I would be taken back to their story progress.

Aragami
I love the Ashborn design, they are unique and colourful.. it would be nice if they have  more backstory more than just pages of description in database. Still I get to fight their variation with different attack pattern, it’s kind of fun.


Cons:

(Warning: I might be ranting incessantly from this point, skip to conclusion if you don’t wanna read)

Story
Pointless multiple choice.. I hate the game that gives me different choice for different answer but none of it has any impact on anything whatsoever. GE team.. please.. just stop doing this. It’s like the DIY trick parent would use on child by wrapping medicine bottle in colorful juice package, it excites them when first seeing it but when tasting it, they feel betrayed. Just don’t…

Mission:
This game is literally the embodiment of ‘missing opportunity’. I feel like there are a lot of things can be added on the game mission and dev should be more creative with mission. The missions encompasses on defeating main enemy. What about adding some special reward or variety to the objective? I have been interacting with lot of player in GE community and we end up making our own challenge to make the game more exciting which should be easily implemented in the game itself.

Graphic and Animation
Limited gesture, just the basic hands head movement, and roll dancing (for whatever reason). It almost left the impression that the dev is giving less of shlt about it.Limited mission stages, it’s just several scenery used multiple time in different time (day or night setting).

Multiplayer
Limited letter to type when player is chatting in game. My guess is this game is using Japanese-base text layout and it is really painful for English speaker like myself. If you are new to the game yes you can interact with player (during multiplayer session only by pressing F1 two times then ctrl).

Battle Mechanic
Oh my Ra… the freaking camera! I am aware some people have shared their thoughts on this subject. I have spent lot of time tinkering with the setting, and the camera system is just wonky.. especially when fighting in narrow place. 

Party Member
Claire… maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine but the way dev is so focused on her non-significant role and her bulging part is just annoying me to no end. Despite the fact that she is a completely useless party member: barely heals nor supports Both her engage and acceleration trigger is useless (especially for tower shield user like me). She moves randomly all over the place sometime even gets in my way of healing, she carelessly attacks on enemy when it is about to release AOE attack(check my gallery to see one of the example)... Overall she is just a pure pain in the ash. I think she is just intended as fanservice for male fans or joke character. No offence to all Claire fans out there, I am merely pointed out the fact.

Aragami
Reskin.. or paint job or whatever you wanna call it… just why dev? I feel like they can’t even be bothered to port all the unique monster from previous game to this game just for whatever reason.

Customization
Limited to face, eyes color, hair, and voice… and no, player can’t even move the eye position or change the shape/size of the nose or mouth. I can’t even change my character height, body type, or breast size?! What’s the point on that jiggle physic then?!

Fashion
This is very VERY underworked.. I was initially surprised by long list on costume section only to get disappointed by the fact that it is limited design added with minor detail each and different color. Don’t get me started on the facial/hair accessory… -.-


Conclusion:
I personally love this game with all its flaw.. just because I pointed all the terrible aspect of it, that doesn’t mean that I want to put this game in negative light.
Disregarding all the whiny ranting, would I recommend the game?
…. Yes.
Just because.. well.. how many non mmo anime based with customization game are there? Up to the day of this post there are not many.. So if you are a customization maniac like me.. this game is definitely must try.. but if you’re just an average gamer, looking for some fun playing with friends… I would still recommend to buy this game when it’s on sale so you will not get your expectation thrown down the cliff.

899440,114592102,76561198895211070,50,5,2171,0,1486,1689178642,"As a casual player but a big fan of God Eater since 2012, this is a more polished game than the previous 2 (5, if you count the expansions and/or remasters) But somehow It didn't really make a big memory for me. The story in this installment is inferior to it's predecessors with the original God Eater story being the best out of the bunch and with the Burst Arc behind it. This game has almost no memorable moments. If you're a GE veteran the thing you will get hyped the most is seeing Soma in the OP and hearing his story, that's it.

On to the gameplay;
Combat is fluid and fast, I like it... a change of pace from the older games which I quite like.
The cons that I have is that this game is too beginner friendly, it's hardly a challenge. In the older games, a damn Vajra literally appeared in a Rank 1 mission but not as a main target. a Rank 3 Vajra can easily 1-3 shot you if you don't be careful and It's hella tanky. In this game, the enemies are meh, even the Ash Aragamis. Thin health and easy to read. Don't forget that one mission where you fight a literal Ouroboros by yourself in the original game that was hella suprising and I love it

Camera lock-on is a pain in the arse especially if you're playing with Keyboard and Mouse, it changes targets if you move my mouse. there are no settings to disable it (I'm only aware of Lock-on target options being By Part or By Aragami but that still won't do).

Weapons don't really have weight to them. the older games captured this well, in this game? The Buster Sword feels light, same goes to the Boost Hammer. What happened?

Burst Arts are a nice addition, but it makes you main an attack instead of maining a weapon. Take the original God Eater (and it's expansions being Burst and Resurrection) for example, plain and simple stuff. It makes you master a weapon rather than having an attack that does big damage and repeat it billions of times which makes the game really repetitive and boring.

Maps: yeah no, only 10 maps (+1 which you only play in once) to play in and none of it are memorable. Aegis was hella memorable because of that scene in GE.

Cosmetics: The devs have a tape fetish. Jokes aside, it's quite meh here. Same goes for the older games, but at least they had some cool ones. It's more limited in GE3

Aragami variants: Not much, some flagship aragamis from all the major God Eater installations and some common aragamis. Variants such as Tyrant Hannibal, Nuadha Eire, etc. are pretty badass.

OST: Godlike as always, with Nemesis being my personal favorite in this game. Some remixes of the previous games' OSTs are also present here which is pretty neat.

Overall, i'll give this game a 7.8/10

Note: I really want this series to bloom. I love it since my early days with my brother, we both did. I want people to give the series a go, even if they don't really like it in the end.

So the changes, there are many, first off as I'm sure any player would notice the art style is a lot more refined which is nice but I feel the game suffered in some areas for it, a big edge God eater has over something like say Monster was two particular things, first is the more fast paced action combat of which it focuses on, great for people who want to slay monsters and not fixate on weapon sharpening, hunger, fancy traps that take a while to make, hot and cold areas and the like and it keeps to that, the second which it didn't keep sadly were outfits, the first two games had many many outfits and not just recolours and slight variations of the same costumes like in GE3 this had a huge impact in my eyes as character creation is a big part of these kinds of games and outfits are a part of that, they added more over time it seems but even so not enough to warrant such a steep decline dood.

Next combat, this has both been improved and yet made worse in many ways, some of which confuse me, enemy hitboxes at times are much too wide as you get hit with a good foot of distance between you and the enemy attack with no visual cue to judge whether you can dodge it or not, talking of dodging that's practically pointless, between enemy attack range, attack speed and how small the dodge is with no iframes to speak of it ends up being a waste of both health and stamina at the same time often where it counts at that, I didn't go in depth with shield types but as far as buckler goes it's outstanding and I feel they made shields overall better probably because of the poor dodge, combat at least with scythe feels a lot slower which messes with the advantage of range it has vs the new found speed a lot of enemies have but again I focused on the scythe and guns are pretty much almost the same bar a lack of certain variety, I'll get to custom bullets soon dood.

As for the the good of combat enemies now are balanced in an interesting way that the games probably easier than it needs to be, despite what I may have made it sound like, the damage isn't too high in the main campaign bar one or two attack types, knockdown on some enemies seems to last a little longer which is nice compared to the prior two games, melee damage has been buffed out guns are almost the same in damage as far as it seemed, hard to judge with numbers at times to add to the good of the shield you now have a shield dash which is great for closing the gap in a fight and makes up for the speed increase, on top of that compared to the prior games your actual speed is reasonable now without predator mode (GE1) and the shotgun (GE2) to get around places, you also have engage mode, this is a cool concept where the player links with another player and gets a special buff you both share with each other for a set time also blood arts are replaced with burst arts (same thing really) and have managed to do almost exactly what I wanted them to do after GE2 and let you have more than one, the only shame being you had to choose from ground, air and dash attacks, impressively they also added skills to go onto the skills to enhance them further dood.

Okay let's see next up I want to talk about upgrade parts, originally in the first two games you could have two, they were also extremely varied, in GE3 not only are they not all that varied they are quite frankly mostly pathetic, in fact while I'm here effects in general are weaker than ever despite the AGE (Adaptive God Eaters) being the strongest iteration yet of God Eaters, even abandoned God arc effects are just dreadful, levels are limited to 5 even though the max level you can get for stacked effects like more health is 10, which means you need two slots, weapons have 1-4 slots rather than the set 4 slots for those effects and it's dependant on weapon/shield what's more typically the more slots it has the weaker it is bar some exceptions and most effects you'll find are in the 0.something% which will total up to less than 10% typically which basically means? wasted slots because that just isn't worth it for what you get in total, better off with resistance to ailments and health and OP upgrades dood.

Okay now onto bullet edit, I've seen some complaints on this and they are both warranted and yet not really warranted too, before you could make some great effects and the only limit was how much it cost and the slots needed to make these custom bullets, this though apparently broke prior games with basically one shot kill weapons meaning people didn't really play the game properly and honestly? I'm not personally opposed to that even if it's a shame to lose any challenge the game had but GE3 fixes that in a most agreeable manner, custom bullets have an OP cost meter you fill when making them, based on the cost and how many you want of that bullet you fill it up and get a set amount of shots but these shots are entirely free, for instance I had 21 free medium strength sniper shots, typically I can shoot around 5 maybe 6? before I'm out of OP and it takes a decent amount of time to recharge OP although granted they made the custom bullets weaker than normal ones too by a fair margin it still works out as a lot of free damage and if played right a broken enemy part leading to an easier fight overall and a great head start or in certain fights will even be the main damage dealer, all in all it balances out in a way I appreciate dood.

One thing I am dreadfully disappointed in them getting rid of to the point of being rather sour about it is the ticket system, this allowed you to trade for rare parts you may be missing, in the first two games I grinded about...oh right not at all for materials, another advantage I feel it had over other games of the genre, here although it's not the worst as rates are a bit higher and fights go a little quicker dood.

Finally out of what I can mention that isn't spoilery of some of the new stuff which is good interesting stuff to make fights tougher and more interesting is the story and characters! so the cast is great but the tone has been shifted to mostly serious for this one, understandable to a degree all things considered but also sad, only one appearance of a particular old face but despite that the characters are nice and unique in their own ways although some character depth like in GE2 would have gone a long way also less characters to take with you in this too sadly, that said the story itself was interesting and I have to say although overall not as impactful as the last two instalments it did manage to make me tear up a bunch and have a great finale dood.

To finish up I just want to say there is a lot of good and bad that came with this game in terms of what was added or changed but is it a good game? yes it is, a very good one despite the flaws I may have mentioned, in the future if they make another game I hope they fix the issues I talked about, it's a great game series if you just wanna go for battle and no fancy extras on the side, has great stories and I'd love to see what they do with more time, effort and knowledge, thank you for reading dood/ ^-^",1651005682,1651005682,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is smooth; it's pretty much this games only saving grace.  It's fast, it's impact focused, and the controls actually feel good.  However, it pretty much gets ruined by the games horrendous user interface.  The camera is garbage and having a lock on that doesn't focus the camera deletes the purpose of a having a lock on in the first place.  The menus are a mess and even after getting every achievement for this game, I still couldn't tell you half of the mechanics that are present here.  I was still discovering new mystery, ""oh, I didn't know I could do that"" features right up to the end.

Your party members are....OK.  Truthfully, having them makes this game a bit too easy, which is another issue.  In Monster Hunter, items are vital to success, but here, there just optional; with the exception of healing potions, I never came across a situation that required me to drink buff potions, extend my bars, and increase my stats.  You can just spam jump attack your way to victory depending on the weapon you use.  There was only one mission in all of the 200 I played that I even got close to running up the death count.  You have so many life points per monster, you wonder what the point of trying to stay alive even is as dying just gives you a full health bar again.  

My biggest pet peeve is the devour system.  I never played the first two games, but if this was present there I would have the same problem.  This is nothing more than another bull s*** stamina bar in addition to the main stamina bar you already have.  This one unlocks your actual moves that you've equipped and once it runs out, you have to devour a monster to replenish it.  The devour attack is super slow and leaves you open to take a hit.  If you get hit while devouring, it completely cancels it - you just wind up in a turtle state until you can counter with it and replenish your bar.  Honestly, this joke of a system would be better off completely removed than revamped.

I just wouldn't recommend this.  If you want to play Monster Hunter, just play Monster Hunter.  It's a way better game than this one.",1650064805,1650064805,False,12,8,0.484639436006546021,0,True,False,False

Come on guys make a PC, ps5 and xbox (what ever the hell it is) version that will blow all our minds.
Imagination is the limit (as well as budget).
That being said.
I would LOVE to see what you guys could make without having to hold your selves back.
Besides that. Engaging combat, with a very nice difficulty curve.

pros
-character customization
-great bgm (which makes me want to play more)
-good upgrading mechanics
-good fighting mechanics (I personally like this burst arts stuff)
-inspiring characters
-(SPOILER ALERT) nice story, it talks abt discrimination, inequality and you can see that hoomans are one of the most terrifying enemy you'll encounter aside from aragamis 
-quite beginner friendly (I guess)

cons
-map is repetitive
-a bit of awkward fighting animation
-as long as u know how to dodge and determine the enemy's weaknesses then this is easy for you (that probably you might get too bored easily)
-some parts of the story (esp conclusion to every climax) are too predictable

OVERALL, I like this game
If you're into action styled 3rd person perspective anime-rpg with character customization and anime-kind of story then this game is for you :D (as long as u dont buy it on full prize)

The game is of course a massive improvement to the first 2 in the series in terms of gameplay and graphics. No more custom overpowered bullets and quite boring maps and a much smoother game flow. (it's also now easier to check what materials drop or in the area)

But there is a big problem in the game, graphic stuttering and audio issues (it can be somewhat reduced by not using the integrated graphic card) but not entirely, if there's too many things on the screen it will be too much for the cpu/gpu thus audio stuttering. You can also lower your resolution to increase fps (especially if your monitor refresh rate is low)

Another thing that can help fix the video stuttering and fps drop is making it possible to disable shadows, effect and post processing. Which you can't! dynamic shadows is great but this greatly impacts the cpu even if it is on low on the settings, which causes fps to drop massively. (same with post processing and effect). 

Also forced mouse acceleration... Tip. set your mouse speed in missions and out of missions to high instead of standard. since it makes it consistent compared to standard.

But where does most of this stem from? Poor porting, this same goes for the first 2 that was released on pc, though this game is a bit better ported. Other than that, games are just ported to pc, no optimization for pc, which just leads to problems. I though if I'm gone for a few months, the devs will release a patch to fix it. But nope, just disappointment.

Though If you have a good pc, I highly recommend the game. Since it's actually pretty fun.",1619947878,1642906353,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

BUUUUUUT... I changed my mind. For years the God Eater series was just a dirty little stain in my library (1st and 2nd game on PS Vita and the 3rd just recently on steam). However, now that I spent some time with 3, I think I finally figured out the appeal of the games.
Guess I was just either too stuborn or rejecting of this game bc I usually don't play JRPGs.

I noticed that I just kept coming back to this game and just recently even found some motivation to dig up my old PS Vita and boot up the first God Eater there.
I went into this franchise with a completely unfitting mindset.

But now I like it! Guess I just wasn't happy with the game first bc it's something that I'm really not used to. Primarily I play either western or european games and never touched any japanese stuff other than Super Mario and Pokemon when I was little haha
Perhaps I just wasn't ready for a JRPG yet lol

but ye, good game. I like it now!

Do you like Monster Hunter? You like the idea of Monster Hunter being more...anime? You'll like this game. If anything get it on sale.

Stories Meh, but thats sorta secondary I feel in these kind of games.

Multiplayer feels pretty shallow now, so recommend you get this game at 50% off. But single player experience will last you 30 hours if you want to grind out weapons you want for the next fight.

Tutorial is pretty bad as I feel it didn't do enough to tell you the mechanics of the game and what certain weapon abilities do. But checking on youtube and trial and error helped me through this. (An example is how some attacks exploit elemental weakness more versus increasing down damange or ignoring armor. These are custom moves you can only have one at a time and must change between missions if you want.

tl;dr Embrace the kusoge. God Eater 3 is a fun, solid B-tier gaming experience. The graphics were outdated the year this game came out, the story cut scenes give perfect opportunities to go to the bathroom, there are WAY too many menus, and and you can teach a college course on how all of the gameplay systems interact. But then you start a mission where you can perfect parry Anubis and then shoot him in the face with a shotgun the size of a motorcycle. Tolerate the bad parts to indulge in the crazy.

This is a mix of Devil May Cry and Monster Hunter; It's more aggressive and more forgiving in terms of movement and attack commitment than MonHun, but still has that kill things and use them as equipment grind. Your melee, ranged, and defensive options are varied and independent, allowing for combinations such as hit and run melee combat like the short blade only to switch to a heavy shotgun for up close burst damage during knock downs. Or running the Great Sword like buster blades for brutal charge attacks while keeping a sniper rifle on hand for the phases that you aren't sure about. And everyone, regardless of the shield they choose, have access to an invincible parry that works against almost every form of attack.

There is a wildness to the creature design that is honestly refreshing; the monsters are not just big animals or dragons with elemental powers.  You're fighting rocket launching tank elephants, sword wielding mech girls, and kung fu fighting bird men. Not all of them are awe inspiring, but it's hard to think that you're playing a Monster Hunter like game when fighting a screaming angel statue straight out of Nier.

The game allows you to customize your combat options beyond just weapon element and attack stats. After the first handful of missions the game offers you options such as different grounded combos that gives you increased resources, a more powerful special attack that shatters weak points, or maybe a charging attack that has super armor. 

Is this the perfect game? Not really. But that's okay.Going buck wild on monsters and perfect parrying to keep up your offense or backing away just in time to lay into them with a machine gun feels satisfying in a way that is worth ignoring the mediocre parts that happen outside of combat.",1642285879,1642285879,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For fans of the series it's important to note they haven't really changed the formula, other than adding yet another confusing mechanic (I acknowledge I might just be stupid), a couple of good weapon types and made it prettier (the effects are rather showy now). The story is, as usual, complete nonsense but I adore that, the series is both rather serious and ridiculous in equal measure.

Okay, what can I say... Surprisingly I did enjoy it at some point. It might be me but the pace did get faster and with the constant repeatable gameplay it seems very balanced compared to previous games. The fights won't take very long, at least 7-8 minutes if you have the correct weapon for the mission. The grind was lowered to a minimum, so you don't need to waste hours to get the needed material for an upgrade or craft.

The story does seem decent but can't say that it's something from which you will clap at the end. It also is seen that some things were taken from previous games and it gives you a slight ""I have already seen that"" 

Now let's talk about how the game is stagnating in the same place. For a 2018 game, the graphics do look good but it doesn't fix the boring gameplay of repeating battles with the same enemies on and on. The variety of enemies can be counted on fingers of one hand and the worst for that is the copy-paste from previous games. Developers didn't even try to create new enemies and just stick them in this game. The same goes for the locations, tho they are new for this game, you will always have at least 10 missions on the same location but just with some other enemies which at the end of the game will start to get very annoying.

Combat could have been improved or changed at least slightly but nothing was changed and we still need to constantly spam the enemy's weak points to deal the most damage. No combos or strategy creation, just go and spam. Teammates are also not that clever. They can either do a few hits and back away or stand on the other side of the map and fire at the enemy, dealing no damage. 

Gladly, our poor indie studio managed to get us Japanese voices but didn't manage to fully voice MC. All we get are some phrases on the missions and OMG WE GET 2 LINES IN THE ENDING WOOOOOOOOW.

Overall if you are asking yourself if you want to play this game or not, think if you are patient to VERY repeatable gameplay on the same locations with the same enemies, you can try. No, you don't really need to play previous games but it would be good to have at least some basic information about what is going on",1640721549,1640734072,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is alright for what it is as a grind-bosses upgrade-weapons, but it is heavily overshadowed gameplay wise by the much superior Monster Hunter World that has set a new standard for these types of game world-around.

The story is cheesy anime at its finest, with all the expected anime cliches you love from the medium. You're the big, strange hero that somehow has the power to change the world, and everyone will rely on you as the BD hero you are. It's serviceable, but it didn't hook me personally.

The gameplay loop is janky, and the controls sometimes not responding in the way you'd absolutely expect. Delays in button presses or overly complicated reliance on the same button for several actions means if you don't play this game exclusively, you're likely to forget half of your controls whenever you come back. The AIs try their best to support you, but sometimes they actively harm you or get in the way, triggering boss-buffs that could've easily been avoided.

After getting to some of the more interesting Aragami yeah this game gets the nod from me. It ain't without its flaws (movesets are kinda basic without burst which the combat basically revolves around, a tad too many monster attacks have next to no telegraph), but I've been having a blast now that I've gotten over the initial bump that is the beginning of the game and the learning curve, which isn't unsubstantial mind you. But I think its a much better MonHun substitute so far than Code Vein was a Souls substitute. 
Also highly encourage doing as much of the game solo as you can, some story missions will force you to bring the ai partners but I'm having so much more fun trying to tackle every monster alone, especially Ra and Vajra who have been the highlights so far. 

Yeah the story/characters aren't worth a damn but that isn't why you play this.

And for the most part I am very satisfied with this game, the story is harsh and touching taking a peek into a post-apocalyptic world where you play as captive soldier forced to fight in a war that has been going on since before you were born. The combat overall is quite fun, equipping heavy moon or a scythe and burning through everything is a blast. The way the levels and combat work you can almost completely skip any hard parts of the game if you're a casual player while extra missions, timed trials and such add a nice layer of difficulty to the game for those seeking a challenge and provide a good amount of post-game content. I also love that there are zero paid DLC's for this game with all extra content and outfits being released in patches for the game for free.

The only bad parts that come to mind are mostly when I do compare it to Code Vein, which is understandable considering Vein was a newer game and IP. The combat while fun and easy in this game is frustrating at times, especially when doing more difficult content, the window of time between switching weapon modes (biting edge to glaive for instance) feels so incredibly long. I mean really whats the point of spinning it around in the air 6 times before you can use it? You can knock down an enemy that's right in front of you and by the time you devour and switch modes it's already back up and you're stuck in an animation while it wrecks your sh*t to the moon and back.

The story is touching, but I feel like they did blunder quite a bit after you get situated in your main base. At the beginning of the game you could have short conversations and talk to npc's between every single mission, they changed that in the later half of the game only having them when one or two very important story missions happen. They set up the world and the story so well in the beginning and introduced so many major characters and groups that you would think you would interact with and become involved with later given that your interests align, only for most of them to die off screen or become extremists for seemingly no reason while the group that actually did you very wrong and set up a system that caused you to be conscripted into the military at 12 and locked up in a cell with children for years are painted as the good guys. Not to mention them retconning everything they had established about the final boss throughout the entire game in the second to last cutscene.

Gameplay in God Eater 3 is faster than it's ever been before adding new features such as burst arts that enhance aerial and ground combat. Shields can now do boost charges for chasing down fast Aragami or using it to dodge, instant guard, or set up for aerial combos. Three New weapons have been added to the game which include the Dual Wield God Arc which can be transformed into a Double Bladed weapon, the Heavy moon axe which is a chakram type weapon that can be transformed into a massive chainsaw axe, and the Ray gun that can shoot concentrated laser beams that increase in size and power as you maintain it in battle. The new Ash Aragami are pretty tough as well since they can chase you down and use devour attacks to transform in battle. Furthermore the 8 player co-op assault missions are quite challenging and fun to play through. Also I have to say the soundtrack in this game is really good! with the track ""A Narrow Way"" being one of my absolute favorites - 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvLmIFuyo24
The port is surprisingly good with almost no issues on my end, very good performance even on my low end gtx 960 build and controller support working pretty well too. Also another good thing to note is God Eater 3 will be getting FREE post-launch content updates over time that includes new missions, additional story, more types of aragami, new npc ai characters to join you, additional fashion and cosmetics options, quality of life changes, new assault missions, new gameplay modes such as time attack, and much more. 

God Eater 3 also includes Dual Audio so you can change the voices to Japanese if you want.

FUN. Not really all that great, definitely won't scratch every itch that Monster Hunter does if your a more hardcore player, but the bones of the experience are there alongside a few things you just can't get anywhere else that might be worth stickin around for. Solo or group combat against massive boss-monsters with over-the-top weapons and specialized builds. This is a monster hunter clone and anyone denying that is just gone off the copium, but it really lacks the same depth in combat as its' inspiration. It's sort of the KH3 to monster hunter's KH2 if you catch my drift. Really button mashy and lacking the more punishing timing the older titles had. I found it very easy to get through this game spamming the various new broken weapon arts and brute forced stronger enemies with health items, which you can bring a very generous supply of if you're diligent enough to remember. I'm talkin over half your inventory can be dedicated to a range of health items you can suck down with swift animations against enemies that can be relentlessly attacked for the majority of fights that will usually last about 5-15minutes regardless of difficulty once you get the hang of things. I SSS+ ranked almost every mission on my first playthrough that's all I'm saying. I'm probably giving an impression at this point that I'm down on the game but I'm really just trying to illustrate how lax it is for any MH fans like myself who might otherwise find themselves a bit disappointed by this game. There's actually a lot to like here in spite of the gameplay posing little challenge until very late in the game and not evolving much beyond ""How am i gonna abuse the game's systems to stunlock and sidestep this boss dead in 7 minutes?"" The ability to customize your build and really micromanage your approach to any enemy is really smooth and intuitive in all the parts that matter. I'm confident after my first experience with the games main campaign that every enemy in the game can be killed in like 2 minutes with proper preparation, which I actually like. It's not afraid to let you get a roguelike level of broken at nearly any stage in the game. This game has the classic problem every really ""Anime"" game has of LOOOTS of menus, but there's only four elemental damage types, monster's weakness are usually shared before the start of each mission, and it's not very hard to guess when the new blue variant of a monster you've encountered is gonna have a fire weakness. The bullet crafting system is super in depth and fun and cool just like in the previous games even with the slight tweaks and new additions, it's too bad the game doesn't really show it off or encourage you to use it just like the originals. Switching between gun and blade form feels fluid and allows you to continue putting out massive damage whenever you need a break from the visual clusterfuck of anime swords and demons (melee combat). I HIGHLY recommend this game to someone who's never really been able to commit to ranged combat in monster hunter, because now:
 
A. you don't have to commit to one or the other your gun IS your sword 
and 
B. Again, the BULLET CRAFTING is dope and allows for some crazy experimentation and freedom so ranged combat ain't just viable it's honestly as broken as spamming weapon arts if not more, go wild.

  TL:DR This game is monster hunter if it leaned less into the hyper-in-depth and somewhat realistic RPG lane and veered into the Anime-badass power trip lane, with a pretty average plot and some likable characters despite the cringey dialog. The gameplay is simple and mildly challenging, the UIs and menus are a bit un-intuitive but definitely easy enough to navigate and understand to get ya through the game without frustration, and there's a level of preparation and customization on par with MH and other clones but this is a far easier, faster paced and more accessible experience that hardcore gamers can freely challenge themselves with while newcomers to the genre can enjoy it without being scared off. Numerically I'd give it uhhhhhhhhhh 69/100 ;D come take a bite outta god with your pet Gun-Knife lads.",1636083612,1636083612,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The gameplay can be clunky at times , missions (up to story's last mission) were actually easy and the story didn't pick up until the very last arc. However , the game can be fun after the story missions and the clunky combat became really fun fights with the harder monsters. So if you want to try this out , wait until discount. It is actually worth it.

God eater 3 manages to be a fun game where you mindlessly run around the same 3 maps for 40 hours beating the life out of various enemies.

The story is focused on your mc and his best friend, but as you can imagine more characters start to appear along the way. I don't remember most of them as they are all pretty forgettable and generic ,but the story had some cool moments where it paid off to remember the 3 different things about certain characters.

The cool thing about God Eater lies with the combat and the awesome looking enemies. Best thing in these games is the fact that you can run around and smack a big fox looking thing with a hammer made from their friends.
You`ll find yourself devouring various enemies for parts to use in your weapons.

While the combat is fun it still feels too repetitive and it doesn't hold up all the way through a full playthrough and like I said this game lacks in maps.

for simple reasons. God Eater will always and always feel lackluster no matter what and it wouldn't feel soo smooth compared to Monster Hunter games. That's the only thing I can think of but it has it's own Unique gameplay and progression. It would be 8.5 since they won't make DLC but just constant updates which is pretty nice :3.


I played tons of GE games so I like this. specially it's on PC. 

And do not forget. it's one of the games you only have to buy without DLC. Buy it on sale and it's 10/10 worth the money. 

but is it top tier game? nah. nope. It's not as universally easier to recommend than Monster Hunter games since this is kinda Weeaboo-ish game. so it's target audience is smaller than MH. 

The weapons and Skills are pretty fun. + End game is just cosmetic runs and speedruns which is the common for most of this kind of games.

I currently have 90 hours in the game and there still seems to be plenty more to do in it. God Eater 3 is one of those games where you can just jump right in and play without the need to play the previous titles. Though a lot might be confusing at first, the game starts off (almost too) easy and allows you to get use to the mechanics and gameplay. The story is interesting and makes you want to learn more about the world and the events that lead up to this point, characters are memorable with their own personalities and quirks, plenty of different enemies to fight, lots of unique weapons to craft and upgrade, and enough character customization to be satisfying.

God eater is fairly similar to monster hunter where you and three other allies (npc or other players) go out and hunt large creatures called Aragami on each mission. Once you defeat them you collect parts off of them that you use to craft or upgrade weapons or shields. It can be a bit of a grind to get certain items, however I really didn't notice the grind too badly until you start getting into the high rank missions. Then parts start having a 14-20% drop rate that require you to play the mission over a few times.

I like this game a lot, as I'm typing this I'm 88.8 hrs last two weeks / 114.7 hrs on record, but that's just because I like a very good personal grind kind of game and the monster hunter like style made it easy to understand while keeping the areas just small enough to not make it ""too much of nothingness"".

Honest to god though, I expected a cheesy anime plot line and it's exactly what I got. It's enjoyable at least, with the exception of the child's voice at times which sounded like a possibly cute mid 20's VA that didn't know or feel comfortable with whatever 5~9 year old impression that was.

Combat itself slaps. Like sometimes it slaps you harder than your dad after you get an F- in math, but sometimes it slaps harder like when your friend's butt is right there and you know you gotta wind that baby up and give it the slap of a million exploding suns. And that's just if you're playing with the Heavy Moon

I made a dude at first so I'm glad that I got to mess around a lot with character creation and change the gender after I finish the main storyline quests, it made me wheeze at the end to see my character's 3 different iterations of hairstyle/color and outfits as it did a little highlight part at the end. Just kinda wish I could change parameters of my characters body though, why does child get to be the only small one?

Here in this neutered wasteland this is this 3rd game of one of my high school games that i loved but now even though i play some times its still pretty trash. During your eye strain and brain wiggle i will explain how God Eater 3 is god damn out dated as a game (got censored for taking the lords name in vane but it fit so well), has little to no diversity requirement and stale end game.

Out dated game play:
I like the flow of combat it really gives you very little down time to fighting and your always in it but due to that issue you can only die if you didn't pay any attention to what the game wanted you to do. You play a shorter version of monster hunters with a smaller amount of item pool, a smaller amount of weapon play only to look like a lot but had no point to do so unless you love lowering your power to create a challenge. The main thing that makes this sorta old is that all you do is kill and use your weapon and have no interaction with the environment and all the monsters start to get re-skins but have no real reason to be worked around, and by end game all though cheese is a way to play monster hunters the cheese in this almost has no diversity and turns to mega-man in what i would call true end game grind. With nothing to collect but the same outfit with one layer of difference in a bunch of limited colors that i have a hard time matching because i wish there was a color palette but they couldn't be bothered and even if it would take work i still dont like that if there wasnt a sale this would be 80 buck CAD. Don't get me wrong there is customization but its limited and there are nice things but if you wanted better customization play code vein, and if you wanted better game play that still had good customization but just not as 2D anime styled just go monster hunters world or Rize if you wanted a Japanese theme'd one. Its only a bit more different than the other God eaters but Its mostly locked into the same ""I bite the monster for buffs and whack fast"" with a side of maybe i buff allies for better buffs if there are other people to play with.

Diverse game play?
So there are a lot of things you can speck into for more support-ish stuff or debuff stuff but it doesn't actually make the game go faster and I'm a zoom zoom kinda guy and i do like it if they provide a bigger amount of damage if there is a delay for anything if it is worth it but most of the time when you play long enough there isnt much point in running any support things like heals, poison anything ,or paralyze weapon. In early game you just upgrade one weapon that has no element so it can kill everything on a pretty average rate and once you get into end game its all about elements. I got nothing else to do since no one plays 8 mans squads for raid missions because they don't even really have unique raid bosses and no one really plays so its sorta hard to play and show off your looks. In all situations damage is the answer and i mean it. You don't need to dodge if you have damage, you dont need healing if you kill them faster, and they will never attack back if you knock them down with more damage. Whenever available just get the highest tier weapon thats unlocked, and maybe you will have a second weapon because the unlock path was wonky and your stuck with a weapon thats 1 tier below what you wanted till the next one but don't worry its not the big of a deal and guns dont have much of a point so just look up a good bullet guide and find out that wasting ammo and energy fast is pretty good for dps. Damage is the answer when playing this game and you will only speak in the language known as ""damage"" if you want to be fast and efficient at this game but again thats up to you. I have a limited time in life so i decided faster was better but if you wanna burn time be my guest.

Mega man game play:
End game to me is ""I want a stupid fast build and how do i get there?"" to me that is. Simple look in the files to find every monster has a weakness and build the highest elemental damage weapon for each of them including the dual elemental ones. Proceed to level up weapons by shoving in mods that are good for upgrading while cheesing one boss with tones of damage with the first elemental weapon you fined useful (fire for me as the last act has mods that give 2 levels some times) and cheese till dead. I used a scythe and waved my flag until Drill Man had a gaping hole in the wrong places and it takes maybe a minute. I don't need to know how to fight to farm i just farm till i get the stuff i want and maybe something else happens.

Overall the true end game is finding candy for your in game always starving daughter that everyone loves. And then show of what limited design choices you have to no one and think to yourself ""wow this really is a apocalypse of a game because there's almost nothing more for me to do. In the in I may play this game sometime in the future for nostalgia but in reality i probably wont have too much fun 6/10 i could have fun but if this was a real 80 dollar game i would really need a 9/10 before i shill out on stuff like this because if there's a boob slider but i still don't feel like wanking off to my waifu or husbando then i guess i should of waited till code vein and speed run back step with a real good looking waifu and yes i did need more big Schlong splunk moves if your weren't gonna give me a better monster hunter.",1632985021,1633299929,False,6,1,0.473027080297470093,0,True,False,False

Expect a lot of model reskins, enemy re usage, what could generously be described as six playable maps, mostly used in clumps, so it feels like even less than it is. 

The english voice acting is weak, the story may actually be even weaker, but it's got some heart and i enjoyed playing it. If you can't enjoy yourself solely by experimenting with builds against familiar enemies, you should probably not buy this game. I paid 12 dollars for it during a sale a week ago, i played with a ps4 controller with a missing shoulder button using a predefined customization that steam provided.  gameplay  feels good but its very poor at explaining things, often its hard to even figure out how to use certain moves without using google, which is an issue, as each weapon has a selection of skills that require use to level, similar to final fantasy 2 i suppose.

While i would hate to see their removal, i have to admit that i believe the skill system is an overall blight to the game. only weapons have them, only one of your grounded, air, and dashing attacks can equip them at a time per catagory, which a general moveset having light and heavy, both of which  are 3-5+ in length, any of which can be replaced by a skill, plus your rb+light attack and any combos stemming from that. Air attacks are a bit simpler, only having 3 attacks at most, and dash attacks don't matter, i don't use them very often, they mess with my positioning and cost a lot of stamina for very committal moves that dont often do more damage than my other moves. 

The main issue is that i cannot justify using anything that doesnt level up from a macro perspective. If my skill is on my light attack, i am going to use it whenever possible till it is leveled, first so i can unlock new skills and second so i can maximize its power. My gun has a range advantage so often ill use it regardless, but the fact it lacks leveled skills makes it hard to justify pulling out to use it instead. While i certainly got usage out of my guns, generally i spend most of my time finding ways to spam my skills so i can get new ones. When i get all of them, generally i keep track of which was the most effective and use that one forever after that point. the glaive being the only exception due to its two modes, and even then, usually it's just the same skills till the very end. 

It's a shame that i'm encouraged to spam one attack, as all weapon types have a robust movepool. each of the 9 melee weapons is completely distinct. The four gun types are also fairly distinct, though markedly less so. The ray gun, which i believe is new to this game, lets you charge your ordinarily fairly limiting OP bar into a second reserve like the reserve tanks in metroid for later usage. It requires continuous fire to cap out its damage, so having reserves lets you fire longer. that said, the game will not tell you how to use the reserve, i was 20 hours in before i figured out that guns had skills mapped to RB+dash. The machine gun lets you fire cheap bullets that refund some OP on hit and has a backdash, the shotgun does shotgun and has a forward dash. The sniper rifle does sniper things and has a stealth mode that never feels worth using as it never feels like it does more damage.

Most of the game is a sort of action rpg iteration of monster hunter. You can dash, and burring burst, double jump while swapping between melee shield and gun with speed. Don't expect to change much though, It's far more likely that you'll stay in melee mode for most of your fights. At first you mostly clean up trash mobs, by by the end, you deal with 1-3 minibosses every mission. The minibosses in question having 3 breakable areas that yield additional loot when broken. said loot is used to craft more gear primarily. Larger bosses are also seen, but they  are just minibosses with an expanded moveset, and occasionally fairly well crafted tracks that go with them. They do fairly chunky damage, and move relatively quick, quicker than i think you could reasonably react to if i am to be honest. You eventually learn how to dodge their patterns due to sheer volume of resuse though. After mastering their patterns, you will be getting hit more for negligence than random bullshit coming from no where, but that second element will never truly vanish, especially when you start facing pairs of bosses.

Coming into battle with you are three of six maingame companions that the game seems to believe are more distinct than my experiences seem to have shown. all of the 'install skills' are marginal percentiles, so you really never feel a sudden difference in performance. theres easily over 50 skills for companions, but you only get to pick 4, and the ones that change AI seem to do it slightly, and the ones that make them hit harder certainly don't help with their worm level intelligence.

Each does have a distinct resonance ability, which is a passive both parties will share when a bar fills while in range. I only ever really felt phym's though, so i honestly couldn't tell you what the others did. Presumably a percentage increase to my damage. I spent very little time with claire or goth lady, but i did plenty of missions with ricardo, zeke, phymm, and hugo, all felt interchangeable outside the part where hugo revived me with more health than the others. It's easy to die, so planning for it is wise. You get 9 stamina, you lose 1 per knockdown, 2 if you have to respawn. the proper bosses can afflict you with a debuff that forces a respawn on knockdown, but you won't be failing missions very often to stamina. I can only recall 2 missions i failed, one of which was the somewhat scripted final boss.

back to the topic of install skills, you can put those on your gear as well, gear gradually gets more slots to fit skills as the game goes on,  but the max ive seen is 4. you are expected to spend abandoned god arcs to apply their stored skill to your weapons, but you rarely have good arcs to install, and often you'll be switching weapons often enough to not feel the desire to commit. Unless you want to nurture one weapon with grinding, you will probably end up favoring a few weapon types and crafting whatever you get the materials for first. you essentially cant buy anything that matters, save for recipes for burst units, which are so unreasonably expensive that i didnt get to craft many. They copy weapon skills and function as a strict powerboost that scales with your burst level. If your weapon and burst unit overlap, you will not get double bonuses, itll be wasted.

usually i find myself getting the materials to craft quickly enough to stay up to date, but i also did every optional quest besides the rank missions. The optional missions are light at first, but later on, they really do start to hamper story flow. at some point, you'll consistently get 2-3 side missions per story mission. It does not affect the story in the slightest if you do or dont do side content, to my knowledge, but i wager you'd be using very out of date gear if you skipped them. They probably represent about 2/3 of your item income and a similar percent of your cash flow. as is, i rarely had money issues especially after i figured out the game was giving me money items that i had to manually sell. It never told me that they were for that, it should have done that at some point.

I seem to be nearing the limit of length. It was a good game, but it was a cheaply made one. dont buy at sixty dollars. It has issues, but it also has charm.",1631342243,1631342243,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is basically an animated version of monster hunter as some would say as it's similar to mh in general, like you have a certain time limit to do missions, your targeting specific monsters, your basically hanging around in a hub while monster hunter world has another hub you can hang out at, you can go on expeditions, monsters being weak to specific elements. This is a decent game in general, though one issue I will point out are the controls as God Eater 3 doesn't explain that well on how to perform certain moves or abilities based on the controls set as when you go to control settings, not all are supposedly listed. Like with monster hunter world, you can craft weapons to have a certain element or just base damage as you please. Another comparison that I been reading and noticing is with Code Vein, as some are claiming that the God Eater 3 and Code Vein worlds are connected, though I ain't too sure with that....Lastly, customization is similar to Code Vein as well. One issue I do have with this game is that it can get repetitive fairly quickly and if you do decide to play this game all the way through, then I'd play it in small sessions and not big sessions. Given it's current price at the time of this edit(9/8/21), I do not see it being worth 60 bucks, maybe somewhere in the range of 15$-30$, but I still liked the game regardless. Overall, if you liked Monster Hunter World and Code Vein, then I recommend giving this game a go. Up to you players of course. If you do decide to buy the game, then I hope you will enjoy it! 4.3/5",1625622265,1631157859,True,1,0,0.439999967813491821,0,True,False,False

Overall, I love the artstyle, character design and the world/story felt interesting enough. The game and combat felt fun and refreshing for maybe the first 15 hours. It did however start feeling like I was doing the same fight over and over and over again the further I progressed (Note however, that I didn't finish the game because I got bored in the end, so I can't speak for end game).

Also note, unless you don't care about repeatable fights like mentioned before... for the love of god, don't listen to the completionist in your mind and try to finish all the optional quests unless you want to burn out on the game in record time. There's going to be A LOT of them. If the optional quests had a bit more variety to them (As well as the main story quests fyi), it would make it way more enjoyable.

The combat is fun and fastpaced, but oh boy, I can never bring myself to enjoy systems with animation locking abilities. Please, for the love of god, remove animation lock altogether or at least give the player the option to cancel the ability/animation. It would remove the most (and only) frustrating thing from a combat system which is already very addicting.

There are also quite a lot of other systems in the game like crafting bullets, upgrading weapons, different weird character skills etc. I didn't however spend much time with that because tbh, it simply confused the hell out of me. I would suggest looking up a guide if you're interested, because the game does a pretty poor job in explaining these different aspects of the game...

So yeah, good and fun game for maybe ~15 hours, but gets pretty stale with the content after a while. The combat is my favorite thing in the game, if it wasn't for the animation locking bs.",1629760447,1629819402,False,11,3,0.471413999795913696,0,True,False,False

Most of the negative review is from my desire to see the series improve, as i believe it had a good foundation, just to be disappointed.

I was able to excuse a few things in God Eater Resurrection and Rage Burst, since they were older games. This game however, is a 2019 steam port of a 2018 release it seems. And it shares the same flaws as the last two games which is unacceptable at this point.

Forced mouse Acceleration/Deceleration for the KB+M players. As we all know, PC players love having mouse acceleration in games with shooting and having no precision at all. This also affects the camera as you try to keep your target in view. There is a Lock-on function, but it's not any better in this game than in the previous ones. 

Precision is the goal of any gun, especially the Sniper, which is what I always used throughout the series. Useful for starting fights with big damage, quickly breaking specific parts, and knocking down fleeing enemies. This LONG RANGE weapon sadly cannot fire across the small made maps still. This I hated in God Eater Rage Burst as it could easily be seen on it's ""Abandoned Dam"" map. With map sizes close to modern day Call of Duty maps, it seems that snipers would go maybe 100 meters at most. The bullet editor takes a bit as well, becoming even more limited in creativity and usage. The bullets you create do not use Oracle and you only carry a limited amount. The only bullet type I cared about was the Sniper bullet from GE Resurrection that increases in damage the further it goes. That was not in here.

2 new weapons were added to the game. The Biting Edge and Heavy Moon. Both I do have to say are impressive, creative, and powerful. Game graphics took a step up naturally, and it runs far better than the previous two games. By far, I am most impressed by the translation work. God Eater 1 & 2 translation was pitiful and inexcusable and a 3rd grader could see most of the errors. This was straight up impressive, I selected the English language and that is what I got.

Each game it seems to be harder to get yourself off the ground with some comfortable skills to have on you according to your playstyle. Something as simple as defense, or higher max HP/OP/ST.
This game takes that difficulty to a new level, as the highest level skill you can get from an Abandoned God Arc is 5/10. Crafted weapons also don't gain new skills as you upgrade them. You have it's base skill, and a number of slots for you to put abandoned God Arc skills in. Meaning a majority of your build will be RNG based. That doesn't make the game hard, it just makes it far more annoying.

God Eater typically encourages the use of being in burst as much as possible, while also giving you a bit of ability to handle yourself until you can get it again. GE2 Rage Burst had normal skills and skills only active in burst, some stackable. This game however you are worthless and near defenseless unless in burst as all of the starting skills on equipment is burst only. You have to really be careful trying to go for the devour because missing it is gonna make even a small hit hurt. This is hindered by the fact that I've seen no equivalent to""Mutual Burst"" skill from the previous, and getting 2  burst duration Lvl 5 drops would not only take ages, but give you a whole 10%(i think?) longer burst for two slots. ""Guard radius"" skill seems to be replaced by the ""Fortification"" skill. Which let's you block in all directions. Better than just Guard radius except very rare. It only works at level 5 so I have 2 of them, Lvl 3, on my shield that has just two slots. And that was around, 400 missions in to even see that the skill exists. It's cool i have it now but...ive completed the game, i dont need it anymore.

Burst, that thing that makes God Eaters so powerful, yeah, now some aragami can do that too. These Ashborn Aragami have certain devour attacks that are pretty telegraphed, but unblockable. They're always done after they enrage so you can prepare. Or not even bother since your AI teammates can be targeted and devoured. So enjoy constant burst Aragami. Typically the cycle is enrage, devour into burst, eventually they wear out, then seconds later enrage again. You will learn how to dodge the attacks, your team will not.

The game is also significantly shorter than either of the last two games. Likely sacrificing story content for more multiplayer/endgame stuff. And if you're looking for appearances from the older characters. You won't find them, with small exceptions. This is an all new locale, new characters, in a world ravaged by yet another Humanity threatening disaster that you don't get to actually learn about till the very very end of the 2nd extra episode after the story and 1st episode. It was the only reason I kept playing after getting all the achievements. Also, the story was not as good as the previous games in my opinion. If you look at certain scenarios in the story. It almost seems like they blended certain story elements from the previous 2 games and slapped a new coat of paint on it. Compare the character of Phym to a certain character from resurrection, compare the whole ""Traversing the Past"" extra episode to GE2's Character episodes and the overarching goal of them. And even compare the very end of ""Traversing the past"" and it's child-like character to Ren in God Eater Resurrection.
It feels....recycled, predicable.

One final note is that these games dont exist in a bubble. They are parts of a whole storefront of games to choose from, some of the similar ones. I was told by a friend that God Eater was ""anime Monster Hunter with an actual story."" I cant say that description is wrong. Monster Hunter World came out later 2016 on steam, earlier for consoles. It had problems as a bad port at launch and in some ways, still does. Some problems however, were fixed. 2 years of a similar game on the market, maybe actually look at your competition when making a game. That probably explains why i hadnt even heard of God Eater before from anyone, anywhere else.",1629435234,1629438083,False,130,16,0.720451235771179199,3,True,False,False

The last 13 hours was post game content which features additional story missions and more challenging side missions. Some of these are going to be doable solo but then there's the EXTRA postgame content which almost requires you to have extra human players due to the highly increased difficulty.

The story is just horrific, the worst I have seen in a big budget game like this. Not only it does not make any sense, or you can totally guess what will happen.

The fighting system and the loadouts are dumbed down beyond reason, while the combat seems clunky and out of place. You don’t have to allow 20 skills like in the last games, but the restrictions here are just too much. 

AI felt very random, sometimes characters did nothing, especially healing was a pain, you better team up with someone, to not die and enjoy and laugh about the terrible story and the dumb basic tropes the game has.

[h1] The Pros [/h1]
(+) [b] Improved visual [/b]
The moment I jumped into the game the first thing I noticed was how beautiful it is, and they did an exceptional job on the facial expressions, it is very noticeable on Zeke’s expression during cutscenes.

(+) [b] Environment cycle [/b]
They add cycle to the maps! Night and day, clear or rainy. A very nice addition to the game. For me this makes the whole hunt far more engaging since it would be boring to keep hunting on the same place repeatedly with no changes to anything. This cycle adds that extra flavoring that makes each hunt interesting.

(+) [b] Player friendly special move (BA) leveling [/b]
If you’ve played GE2RB you know what I mean…bless GE3 with its BA progression. But if you’re new to the series then unlike in the previous where you need a specific action in order to gain BA EXP here you only need to hit an aragami or its weak points for better EXP. Makes leveling BA easier and less time consuming than before. If you're new BA is basically improved version of your attacks when you're on burst mode hence burst arts (BA).

(+) [b] Fewer abandoned god arc variations [/b]
The game has fewer abandoned god arc (AGA) variations compared to the two previous games, this in my opinion limit the customization options the game has to offer however, the AGA that are available here doesn’t overlap with other AGA. So, while it’s true the amount is smaller, but you don’t have to worry about getting that one rare AGA only to know that it overlaps with skills that you already installed. Not to mention you can actually buy AGA with in-game currency from a vendor that appear from time to time (stocks are randomized though so you still need to grind).

(+) [b] Better online experience [/b]
Remember the random DC back in GER and GE2RB? Yeaa it doesn’t exist here. But the sad thing is it’s quite hard to find people to play online. If you happen to have a party to play though it’s a different story, net play is smooth af (at least whenever I play with my friend it was)

that’s pretty much why I really enjoy playing GE3, aside from the improvements that they made I really like min maxing my gears so I enjoy grinding for AGAs and in addition to the new normal aragamis the new ash aragamis brings a pleasant change with its ability to burst (gotta learn that perfect guard timing lmao) and change its attack pattern entirely along with boosted damage. Oh and the achievement in this game is waaaaaay easier as well so it shouldn't be as hard as the previous one to 100% which is a huge plus for me.

[h1] The Cons [/h1]
While it’s an undeniable fact that this game had a huge improvement in term of visual, online play, and animation compared to previous game but there are several issues I had with the game but ill only be focusing on 2 of what I think needed to be addressed.

The first one is outfit choices, compared to the previous game this game has [b] one of the laziest options of the 3 games[/b]. why? Because what they have is basically one type of outfit, but they “changed” it and slap it with a different name. for example, in one outfit you have a long sleave while on the other version you either have a slightly shorter sleave or no sleave at all….not to mention in some outfit the difference is so little, that you feel like playing “where’s waldo?” just to spot that changes….I mean come on…..

The second one is the story. While I have no problem with a shorter story mode, but the problem is some arcs aren’t just fleshed enough. They introduced a villain and bam gone, and they did it again, and bam the exact same thing happen. They didn’t leave enough impression heck I can’t even remember what they did. that’s how insignificant their role to the whole story is. To be honest I thought they would make a comeback in the end because how abrupt they were removed early on but nope. They were never mentioned again after their arcs.

Oh and one more thing, I just have to mention this because that’s how important this is….. [spoiler] the game have no Hibari….no Fran…..and worst of all no Kanon…..jokes aside if you compare it to the previous ones this game is whole lot easier.[/spoiler]

[h1] Verdict [/h1]
With that being said, did I enjoy the game? hell yeah I did!!, as someone who’s been playing GE since the PSP version first came out. This whole game is an eye candy. Solid combat and a more balanced special skills (burst arts) compared to the previous game. Sure, the game had some issues, but I still had a blast playing through it nonetheless. If you like GE or burned out from playing MHW all the time, do give this one a try! Totally recommended!",1627915956,1628174539,True,12,0,0.654441356658935547,0,True,False,False

The story is very, like the art style, anime but still somewhat enjoyable.
If i had to compare the game to something else, think monster hunter but more simple and faster paced. 
The difficulty ranges from fair to pretty easy once you get used to all the mechanics and skills you and the enemies possess. To increase it, I suppose you could leave your AI or real life friend at home and go solo, but more often than not, missions just become more annoying not necessarily more difficult. Maps are unfortunately not that varied but the number of completely different medium to large size monsters at around twenty four is fair variety. Re-using maps over and again may stem from the short mission time; usually under or five minutes at the most since you needn't roam the map like in other games in which you hunt something.
God Eater 3 should give you around forty to seventy hours of game play, tough it doesn't track your hours if you are offline, which is odd. Fifty euros is a steep price for, if we're honest, a niche game. But even thirty is good value when you consider the amount of hours in content you get.

Mouse and Keyboard works perfectly for me, I've had no problems with either one. It has better graphics and runs perfectly.

My computer doesn't meet all the minimum requirements, but I've had no problems with it running smooth on high graphic settings. My graphics card is only a GTX 745 and the minimum suggested one is GTX 760. So there is something for those who meet the requirements but have problems. Your computer is the issue, not the game.

The camera is a bit sensitive though, but you can make it a slower in settings. Even then it is still a little sensitive, but not as bad. So just a little thing there for those who don't like the camera moving too fast.

This is one of the best things; They brought back the fast devour from the first one with the shift + right click. That was one of the main things I hated not having in the second one.

Unfortunately they have the crappy upgrade system from the second one. Where you have to find materials, before you know what you need to upgrade your God Arc. So that was a little disappointing, but something I can live with.

A good thing they brought in from the second one is the abandoned God Arcs to enhance your current ones. There are two new types of God Arcs specific to this one, along with a new gun that replaces the blaster and the old favourites from the other two.

They basically have blood arts, though they are called something different. You even have a new team combat skill to use with your companions. I won't go into many details on that though, you can play it to find out anyway. It unlocks early in the game. Better ones unlock later as well.

The character customisation is great. I've checked both male and female customisation options and you can create cool and attractive characters. Most accessories from the other two are also in this one, though there are some which aren't, like the horns.

To unlock new outfits, you need to buy or find schematics. The same can be said about making new God Arcs, guns, and a few other things you unlock later. These you can get through the basic combat missions, or buy from a merchant that is unlocked when you get further into the storyline.

Like the other two games, they still make your character feel special and unique, with having a high resonance and being skilled in combat. The storyline is also interesting. I am always curious about what is going to happen next and what caused the 'Ash Storms' in this one after the other two.

For first time players of the God Eater series though, I would suggest playing the other two first. They have a whole tutorial to help with controls in this one, but playing the other two will give you a good idea of how combat plays out. Plus introduce you to some great characters. One you actually meet again in this one.

Added Bonus:

Your character actually has a past. You aren't just that unknown skilled rookie that becomes the heart of your party. You were with your port, which is like a branch in the other two but smaller since you were a child. You even have a childhood friend and he is your groups leader. Mature and down to earth. Plus he looks nice, so that's always good.

They even have a Kota/Romeo combined character, who becomes obsessed with that damn 'Bugarally' like Kota in the first one. Though that comes a bit later in the story.

Fans of Shio may love this. 

There is a Shio like character guys. She is a lot cuter than Shio was and you get to spend more time with her. That in itself is a good enough reason to get the game and play through the story if you really adored lil Shio. That little cutie has stolen my heart.

Oh, something I forgot to mention. You can respond the way you want in certain situations. More so then in either of the other two. It makes you feel more in control of your own character and brings with it more immersion. Talking with everyone in between missions is also quite interesting. You have some fun convo's.

All in all, if you are a fan of the other two God Eater games, I am sure you will enjoy this one. Though that is just my opinion on the matter. c:

P.s. I'm gonna say, stop comparing this to Monster Hunter. It isn't the same, only similar in some ways. Besides, this game is way better then Monster Hunter as far as I am concerned.

Latest Update:

So, I finished it. It's a bit too short, especially compared to the other two games. I dunno if anything extra is meant to happen when doing those other optional missions, but I have no desire to grind through them. They'll be handy if I ever need to let off steam though. =w=

Another downside. They didn't even explain how the Ash came to be, same as when they didn't explain the Blood Rain from the second one. They were just there, no explanation or anything.

It was worth buying, but neither the second or third games can even compare to the first game, story wise.

Most Recent Update:

Played through the additional mission they added. It was fun, had me biting my nails at one point, but things turned out well. It's still too short though.

Now they have New Game + and the ability to completely remake your character.

[list]
[*] You can create your own protagonist character. I created a girl based on the character I played when I played Code Vein and I enjoyed playing with her to the very end.

[*] I liked the story, it is not an epic story but it is quite good. Although I should say that some of the bits I liked the most were actually from “Traversing the Past” and not from the main game story.

[*] Nice gameplay with a lot of variety, that being said I actually found my favorite playstyle quite early and yes it turned out to be the same one I went for in Code Vein.
[/list]

What I didn’t like:

[list]
[*] Very small variation in terms of levels, there are like 5 different maps in the game each one with two possible variations, so 10 levels in total and those 10 levels repeat themselves once and again through the whole game it becomes quite boring after a while I wish they had spent more time into adding more maps, perhaps even minor variations to the same levels. This also goes against what is happening in the game, you are supposed to be traveling the world in a moving transport and yet you find yourself fighting in the same underground levels again and again?

[*] In the end I got used to it but the controller layout is pretty bad. A lot of the game actions depend on or involve the R button, you use it to run, to change your weapon to fire link rounds, to deploy your shield… Sometimes you just want to run towards an Aragami but you accidentally change your weapon, sometimes you want to fire link rounds but you end up firing normal bullets instead… the L Button, L Trigger, and the R Trigger, they are only used in menus… so… yeah….. The control has more buttons, you know?

[*] The locking system is terrible, I never used it. I guess I was expecting something like the locking system from Code Vein, here it is a nightmare, you lose the lock without reason and if you need to move the camera, you end up changing the target instead... 
[/list]

All in all I would say the game has more pros than cons, but I somehow have the feeling that the price tag is way higher than the game is actually worth. I purchased it with 80% off so I have no regrets but I would say the game is probably worth only half its price.

On a side note: I mainly bought this game because I played Code Vein and after finishing it I wanted to learn more about the God Eater world. After a few hours into the game my curiosity was even greater, so much so that I watched the God Eater anime and purchased God Eater 2 (which also includes God Eater 1, that is what I’ll be playing next). The God Eater universe has a lot of depth to its lore and if for nothing else but that, these games are worth at least one playthrough.",1626635209,1626635209,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Environments are all boring, ugly hallways formed in a circle. 

-Moveset balance is trash and with many weapons the best thing to do largely boils down to spamming a single attack ad nauseam. you have to force yourself to play 'interestingly' in spite of what the numbers obviously push you towards doing for dps. the worst you can say about almost any weapon in any particular version of monster hunter, at least 3rd gen and on, is still better than what you get with the average weapon in this game.

-Monsters are ugly and uninteresting. patterns generally short and repetitive and not particularly satisfying to counter. 

-Shitty cookie cutter plot with characters I cannot imagine anyone mustering the tiniest bit of enthusiasm for spins its wheels constantly. largely skippable but if you're expecting even a mediocre Tales of or Code Vein esque story to carry you through this one you will be disappointed and bored out of your skull, and anyone who just wants to play the game will be annoyed at having to run around base talk to nearly every single NPC after many missions.

I expected something decent and went in with an open mind as someone who liked Code Vein despite its flaws and plentiful jank (I realize that Shift didn't actually work on this entry but I figure the association and parallels between the two as shameless knockoffs of hugely successful games that I like quite a bit is enough to provide some perspective) but even for 12 bucks this was a waste.

I love this game's focus on quick and deadly boss battles. Other reviews might compare this to Monster Hunter, but Monster Hunter is a slow burn, while God Eater hits the pedal to the metal; Adrenaline, go! It is not uncommon to finish a mission between 90 seconds to 5 minutes. The quick missions also mean that it's an easy game to play in chunks - get a couple of missions in 10 minutes, then go do something else.

That said, the entire first chapter is kinda slow. Trust me, the game gets better after the middle of chapter two.  I guess those missions are there to teach folks who are new to this genre the mechanics of the game. Which there is a LOT of. There's just a myriad of mechanics and systems. I can imagine it overwhelming newbies. It is definitely not friendly to people new to gaming.

Just listing a few off the top of my head, you have to juggle your HP, OP, STA, Items, Burst Gauge, Burst Moves, Team Mates' Abilities (fully customisable), Link Burst, Engage, Elements, Status Effects, 8 Melee weapons' quirks, 4 Ranged weapons' quirks, 3 Shields' Quirks, Custom Bullets, Guarding, Perfect Guarding, Crafting, Upgrading, Installing Skills, +1 & Forging Skills... All while figuring out the enemies you're fighting.

While this can be overwhelming, it provides great depth to the game. You will come to enjoy a playstyle that suits you. In my 51 hours to get all the achievements in the game, I've basically only used the Longsword (main weapon), the Buster Sword, the Shotgun and the Tower Shield. I'm definitely mulling a New Game+ where I try out other weapons.

There is a theme of self improvement that can be found in this game. The joy you get when you defeat a monster solo, without taking a single lick of damage. Then you remember way back when; you actually went down fighting it with a team of 4. You've improved. :)

The combat and fight against the Aragami is still satisfying , but the quest and level design is so tedious.

GE need to take example from how Monster Hunter evolved in form of MH World. If GE team can improve their game design structure, above it's already satisfying combat, I believe it can reach even more audience in the action-rpg fans.

Oh and also the thing that GE team need to take notes, is the story. Right now, it's just your typical action anime story who lack identity even if we compare it to the first God Eater

If you didn't like earlier iterations of GOD EATER, then there's probably nothing to like about GOD EATER 3 either.

The story is uninteresting, but the storytelling is just outright bad in my opinion and has pacing issues. The dialogue also feels incoherent with the story and is frustrating to go through. There's little development in terms of characters and it gave me a very odd feel the more I try to invest in the story. For e.g. characters become best of friends/family in the most abrupt way. I'm also suddenly an ace in the team and have exceptional reasonance ability for no rhyme or reason. It's a shame because I felt that the character designs were great (with the exception of [spoiler]Phym[/spoiler] who is goddamn annoying) but the execution of the story is outright horrible. The fortunate thing is that cut scenes can be skipped. The anime cut scenes (done by ufotable) is pretty good but there's very few of them unfortunately.

Every mission is awfully short. Since there isn't much to explore in each map area, most missions are going to end in under 5 minutes. Later missions (very far in the story) are definitely harder but even that will likely end in less than 15 minutes. The level designs are quite poor and feels like handheld games in an older era. The starting few missions are just outright terrible - they are basically tutorial missions which don't even do a good job of teaching the basics. Instead of using a mission to go through the basics with you, they make you load into a series of missions that lasts less than 3 mins each.

You can bring up to 3 AI companions in each mission. They can be customized but there's not a lot of things that you can do about their behaviors - as opposed to the ridiculously long list of abilities that you can unlock for them. They are pretty competent and I've never felt like they were a baggage to bring along.

The controls are responsive but the control scheme is rather complex due to the fact that your weapon has 3 forms. The action is fast-paced, plays fine and combat is pretty fluid - though I never felt as satisfying as I was expecting. Every weapon has its own unique move set (including special attacks) and can be further modified with Burst Art (BA). Some BAs change your moves entirely, for example, there is a BA that change the long blade's Zero Stance (a stamina recovery move) into a flashy counter move. However, weapons are also normalized in that they all possess universal moves like step (i.e. dash), dive, devour, step attacks, transformation to a ranged weapon and shield (for guarding). There's something that should be noted about how the series plays differently from other action games that may be rather obscure at first. By default, there are no i-frames to steps (that may look and feel like dodges) and the way damage can be nullified is through a Perfect Guard where you put up your shield just as an attack is about to hit you.

While the combat does require some skill, it's rather shallow. Pretty much every fight essentially boils down to opening with a devour attack to get Burst status and then maintaining it while doing damage by spamming Burst Arts. If you're looking for a challenging game, this isn't one of them - at least not until you've progressed to post-story content which sadly, can take as long as 15+ hours to get to. Post-story monsters are more of a challenge but they can often feel cheap - which may frustrate you. Pretty much most fights are going to feel meh and you're often required to partake in annoying missions that involve fighting multiple bosses at the same time, made worse if the map doesn't have many open spaces. The best parts of the action for me were the Adapative Aragami fights which are arguably the most fun.  Adaptive Aragamis (unlike regular Aragamis) have devour ability like yourself which can rip off your Burst status for their own use, powering them up significantly and immediately becoming a threat. Their devour attacks are fast, can be difficult to avoid and can only be terminated prematurely by responding with a perfect guard. I can certainly see how this can be fun in multiplayer. Unfortunately, as fun as these fights are, they end pretty quickly too.

Character progression is primarily based on upgrading equipment and leveling certain mechanics. Enhancements to gear (Install Skills, Burst Plugins and Bust Control Units) is rather convoluted at first and can take considerable time to understand. Almost all enhancements feel underwhelming and sometimes provide only mediocre improvements with hefty investments. Burst Arts which are weapon moves modifications, require leveling to increase their performance by utilizing them in battles. It's a fairly interesting way to make you work for them, though it may not be to everyone's tastes. There are 2 other mechanics that can boost your character's in-combat performance - Engages and Accel Triggers. Engages are predefined boosts that are activated with a nearby companion and causes both parties to share their Engage boost with each other. Accel Triggers, on the other hand, are personal boosts that are triggered only under certain conditions - like performing 4 devour attacks. Accel Triggers are one of the better aspects of the gameplay in my opinion and there are many of them that are generalized under a few activation conditions. Accel Triggers also need to be leveled by triggering them often in battle and certain triggers like avoiding damage, maintain gun mode and perfect guards actually do require you do exercise some skill.

The graphics are decent by today's standards. The visuals do look very good in the combat area as compared to the in-game rendered cut scenes. The environment, while lacking in variety, do look aesthetically appealing to me but the pace of the game really diminishes this quality. Music is good for the most part but doesn't really stand out in any way. When you finish Rank 6 story, a custom jukebox unlocks with additional music tracks from previous titles which is really nice. Unfortunately, my favorite track from GE2RB, ""To an unending battle"", isn't on the list. If you're reading this but have already owned the game and have unlocked the jukebox, I suggest setting your in-mission music to GE2RB's ""Butterfly's Invitation"" to have a more upbeat combat music.

Character creation is service-able. It has a fair amount of options but not a lot. There's a lot of outfits to unlock but most don't really differ too much from each other. After completing the story (past Rank 6), you can remake your character entirely without having to start a new game - which I see as a positive.

In terms of performance, the game starts up really fast and runs solid. In my 59+ hours playthrough, I've not experienced a single crash nor any noticeable framerate drops. There are, however, a couple of occasions where audio is out of sync in cut scenes.

If you're looking for a chill monster hunting game with many things to grind for, this game might appeal to you - the grind isn't really that bad considering how short missions are. 

While GOD EATER 3 isn't a bad game, its best aspects are really just average and it overall lacks polish. As such, it is simply not good enough to recommend at its asking price. Even with the high discount during sale, it's likely that one will still feel disappointed by the game. Personally, while I didn't have a terrible time with it playing solo, I can't really say I had a great experience either. I certainly disliked the game in my first few hours but found it to be better in the later part of the game. But I certainly disliked the storytelling and level of polish from start to finish. While it's combat can be considered a strength, the fights are way too short for me to find enjoyment - and I don't fancy using handicaps (like not bringing companions) as a way to introduce challenge.",1625648545,1626267373,False,0,0,0.458015263080596924,0,True,False,False

The story itself is alright, music is fantastic (Go Shiina does great work on the GE series), and the gameplay is fast and fluid--minus some janky hitboxes here and there. It can be grindy at times, but I personally didn't mind it and I wouldn't say grinding is necessary for beating the main story. I finished all the side-quests prior to the final mission bc I personally just like that kind of stuff. Grinding only becomes an issue towards end-game when you need that one rare material with like a 3% drop-rate in order to upgrade/craft the highest tier equipment. That can make it a bit tedious. Speaking of end-game, GE3 has a ton of replayability in my eyes. New Game +, Assault missions for better gear against powered up bosses, Certification missions to test your abilities in a group or solo, time attack missions, and two new chapters after the main story were added via updates. Not to mention the prospect of max leveling your gear. There's actually a lot to do if you want to.

One important thing to note, however, is that the game may or may not crash for people. It doesn't appear likely that they'll ever address the problem, but after searching online I did come across a way to avoid the crashing if it does occur--change all global settings to [on] in the nvidia control panel, run the game as administrator, and run it in compatibility mode. That has seemed to fix the issue for me and I haven't had problems with it since (fingers crossed).

All in all, GE3 is a very enjoyable game for those who like action-packed gameplay and a grind to some degree. Aside from the potential crashing issue, it's a good game with many hours to sink in to if you so choose",1573745662,1625968006,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But the combat and variety of weapons and abilities carries it, along with the slow ramp in difficulty and decent-enough story. I've got a few R7 missions left to go, but I'm not sure how much farther I'll take it. There's still a ton of post-game challenge missions, but without the lure of additional story or more upgrades I'm reaching the point of ""been there done that.""

One big disappointment was the passive skill selection. Starting with the ally skills - most of them have so little effect they just don't feel like they matter at all. Like, 3% extra damage levels of useless. A few of the better ones make it up to mediocre I guess, but nothing that jumps out like ""I gotta have this!"" 

Even more disappointing were the player character skills from Abandoned God Arcs  - not only are the numbers just as pitiful as the ally skills, you don't even get access to most of the sort of useful ones. There's Follow Up for an okay damage boost and... that's basically it. You could get extra Aragami materials I guess, but I haven't really felt like those were in short supply.

(This is a review from a first time God Eater Player) so don't take my review as the say so to buy it right here and now.

CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION
Alright first off in terms of character customization, its pretty decent compared to Code Vein. I will say that I did not see anything that allowed you to adjust your weight or height unless my speedy eyes just glossed over it. There are quite a bit of options to choose from but its a minimum 4% compared to code vein's character customization. The game does also feature code vein accessories like the purifier mask.

TUTORIAL
Let's admit that a lot of us never really read the gaming manuals whenever we bought a hard copy of a game. Its a good thing the tutorial is actually pretty fast and convenient so when i say it'll take less than 3 minutes to jump into the story, its that fast. You probably wont even notice it. In fact, I say the game mechanics are actually quite easy to learn.

GAMEPLAY
Simple, easy, and straightforward like any other hack & slash game. If you like beating monsters with a giant kitchen knife and cricket bat, this is the game for you! Are you a monster hunter veteran? Are you looking for a more anime edgy feel to your hunt? This is also the game for you! Seriously, it gives you the option to cut off multiple parts and then harvest their dead corpse. 

PT.2
The game pretty much has the same mechs as monster hunter. You kill, harvest, craft, upgrade, and become a total badass. It's just that the animation and attacks are a lot quicker and more precise from my point of view. You have multiple skills to work on, multiple weapons to choose from, did i mention the fact that you can dash pretty damn fast and far? So for people who want a speedy progression in the game, you get to shoot around like warframes. 

STORY
I'm only 5 hours in but the characters are pretty solid. Voice acting isn't bad at all. In fact I'm kind of enjoying the little interaction I have with each character after every mission. If you're looking for immersion into the story. I suggest talking to almost every character if you can. Sometimes they give you pretty cool details and it allows you to form a closer bond with them.

I think that's about it for the game for me, if you're new and looking for something to play. I would recommend getting this game while it's on sale. I don't know about buying the game at full price but ill probably come back to edit this later if i think the game is worth buying at full price.",1625761883,1625761883,True,1,0,0.504148304462432861,0,True,False,False

If you came to this game thinking (or you were told by someone) that its kinda like monster hunter but more grindy and anime, then you're wrong. I got this thing on an 80% sale, and I'm still let down.

TL;DR: It ain't worth it.


#1: FORGETTABLE ENEMIES - I can not for the life of me remember the name of most of the Aragami (the monsters) that you fight in this game. The only ones I do remember was Ra and Vajra. All of the enemies are just so forgettable, even the big spooky ash aragami that are supposed to be deadly and terrifying are pretty bland. Very few of them stood out to me, which is disappointing because a lot of them do have cool designs. There is one that is literally like a walking tank fortress that fires missiles around itself while fighting you. 

The main issue here is that when you go into a mission, you only spend about 3-5 minutes fighting the enemy, their name doesn't appear when you choose the mission, and it only briefly pops up on the side when they get enraged or you break something. Worse yet, the materials you collect off of these enemies don't even have matching names with what it came from, making it really difficult to remember any of the names. Oh you want to make that cool weapon? Okay, go collect some bahamut materials. Where do you get bahamut materials? The mission where you fight the Caligula. Wait, what?


#2: COMBAT IS BRAINLESS - In monster hunter, each weapon has its own flow and rhythm to it, with a variety of  attacks that combo into others. Enemies have a relatively precise hit box, and you can dodge around and underneath them to get into better positions. You can target certain parts to help increase your rewards while also weakening the monster. For example, breaking a Rathalos' wings makes it weaker at flying.

In God Eater, there is none of that. Each attack is its own thing, and there is no way to combo between them. You could argue that you can combo between the standard X and Y but this just transitions between the two. Then there's jump attacks and step attacks and that is it. Then of course there is the Devour system and burst mode, which I despise. While in burst mode you get some benefits and Burst Arts. This whole system is cool in theory but ultimately doesn't work out. Nothing else matters other than maintaining your burst so you can spam your strongest attacks, and trying to get the devour attack off leads to you getting hit because the animation takes like 3 seconds, and yes that includes ""quick devour"". There is little nuance to the system, and as a result it feels really button mashy in between deploying your shield so you don't get 2-shotted by attacks. Speaking of which.


#3: ENEMY ATTACKS ARE RIDICULOUS - If you've played a decent chunk of monster hunter, then you've probably fought against the Rajang, an incredibly fast and powerful monkey enemy that gets super charged with lightning. Every single fight in God Eater with a medium or large aragami is like fighting Rajang on steroids but with a fifth of its health. All of the enemy attacks are incredibly fast, cover massive areas with gigantic hit boxes, and will more often than not do somewhere around 30-60% of your health in damage. You're only saving grace is using your shield to (hopefully) block the incoming attacks, but sometimes that doesn't work because the hit was registered slightly behind you so you take all the damage anyway. Now, I understand that in God Eater they have that endurance system and allies can revive you, so each person can die like 9 times before you fail the quest, which is a far cry more than the collective 3 carts that you get in a monster hunter quest. But getting knocked out still doesn't feel good. 

Every enemy has the same kind of attacks too. They all have attacks that will send them flying forward, or shoot some projectiles around, or do a burst around them, or where they slash a bit in front of them, so on and so forth. This adds to the issue of them being forgettable, since none of them have unique moves. All of their attacks move so fast and cover massive areas in a short time, its really jarring when most of the enemies are around half the size of a house. Seriously, the enemy attacks in some instances come out as fast as your own. You don't get to craft any armor to help mitigate this damage, so you can only rely on the shield and hope the attack doesn't just hit behind you.


#4: MUCH CUSTOMIZATION, LITTLE EXPLANATION, LITTLE EFFECT- This is both kind of a compliment to the game and also a complaint. There is a lot of customization and things you can equip, most of which do something to affect your gameplay. One of 8 weapon types, three separate burst arts unique to each weapon type,  burst art effects for each burst art, gun, shield, engage effect, acceleration trigger, and burst control unit. You can also level up burst arts and acceleration triggers by using them, which leads to unlocking new ones. You can install skills onto your weapons, gun, and shield to provide you with bonuses to increase your abilities. There are two problems here. First, the game does very little in explaining the finer points of how these systems work. You have to dig around in the database to get a grasp of all of the systems, what all everything is and how it works. Then once you do actually understand it all, you realize that most of these things you can equip make insignificant changes. 

""I can install this Crusher Lv. 4. It gives me +0.5% crushing attack power per level so a grand total of 2% of 130 so that's like an extra 2 power.""

""I can equip this Aficianado, which increases the drop rate of better god arcs. Oh wait its level 2 and the skill only comes into effect at level 5.""

The more I played with this system, the more that I was disappointed by it. Over time I realized that actually this system is the same as monster hunter's decorations except worse. The skills you can equip in monster hunter can offer a benefits that can greatly improve or change your game play. Here, on the surface it looks like there's a lot of customization to build a character perfectly attuned to your play style, but in the end it turns out the whole thing is actually pretty shallow. The only really interesting and actually game changing system here is the custom ammo, and while its interesting and very in-depth, it is also extremely daunting to try and play with.


#5: MAPS ARE SMALL, BLAND AND NONSENSICAL - This is more of a personal gripe, though I say that like the rest of this wasn't just a load of personal gripes. It's more that this stems from playing a lot of monster hunter and the maps that you would often get in those. God Eater's maps are incredibly small, both in size and in variety. I didn't realize that by the time I had hit rank 4 I'd pretty much seen all of the maps except for one. There are 5 areas you regularly visit, and each of them have 2 variations, making a grand total of 10 maps in the game. Each of these maps take maybe around a minute to traverse entirely and collect all of the items. The general layout feels so slapped together like they were made by a random dungeon generator. Even when you run through the story quests, you just kind of jump around, beating one or two aragami, and then move on to a completely unrelated but somehow connected area. Or you'll do two or three missions where you go to the exact same area every time, starting in the same location even though supposedly you're moving across the land to get to a new area. I'm just saying, there are a lot of these frozen underground facilities that all seem to have a similar layout to each other.


Overall, the experience is just kinda bleh. I actually don't like giving this a not recommend, but steam doesn't have a ""meh"" option. I don't know, maybe there's something I'm not seeing, but if I'm not seeing it after 20+ hours of playing the game, then I feel that's more on the game than on me.",1625201625,1625201625,False,72,5,0.667847335338592529,1,True,False,False

It's been a while since i follow God Eater, i just remember a few thing about the previous story. If you are a person who really must play the previous game first, just buy God Eater 2 Rage Burst, it's already include God Eater Ressurection which is the remake of the first God Eater and God Eater Burst. Then play God Eater Ressurection, God Eater 2 Rage Burst and then this one. 

Of course there was improvement, the animation for combat is more, more smooth, it's over my expectation. I like the new UI, especially for when you are in combat, HP, OP, ST, Time, etc is more simpler and the UI for the terminal where you can customize loadout, craft, upgrade equipment and else. You still can install skill for your God Arcs, but now you can install skill in melee, gun and shield, you still need Abandoned God Arcs for install skill in a weapon and each weapon have their abandoned God Arcs, you can't install melee skill in gun or  a shield and so forth. There still option to customize your bullet, create your own variation of bullet if you like. For the weapon, there are 2 new melee weapon, Biting Edge that you can use dual wield or became a twin bladed glaive and Heavy Moon that was a curved blade and can transform into axe. There are no Blast Gun anymore, but there is a new type named Ray Gun. And no difference about the shield. For new features, there was a Dive, it can be said a charge that can make you move faster with a cost of stamina, it nice beacuse make it easier to appraching or even stay way from enemy. Burst Arts, which is Blood Arts with new name, that can be activated when you devour an aragami, for the additions there is Burst Art Effect that will adding additional effect of attack like small whirlwind, cross attack and other effect. Other i like is Engage system, if you fought near your allies, you can activate the Engage that grant you and your ally that activate the engage some buff effect. Every character have their own buff effect, you can customize your buff effect in the Terminal. There are one new type of Aragami too called ""Ashborn Aragami"", that was an Aragami can use devour. Be carefull of that devour attack or that will be troublesome, cuz that will increase Aragami damage, cannot use engage and that will be fatal if you dead when your status is devoured.

For the story, i can enjoy it. You play a Role as an AGE (Adaptive God Eater), the types God Eater that have more ressistance to Ash. For AGE, they wear armlet on each arm instead regular God Eater that can just wear armlet on one arm. Previously, i got some dissapointed for no Japanese Audio, but nicely now they adding it. I like the new design of new character, some of aragami have repaint too. Its bring some Monster Hunter experience but it's not full like Monster Hunter, it more simple, you get more information about the mission like what material you can get and how much the percentage about getting the material. You can play multiplayer or maybe just play with the AI, don't worry for the AI, the AI system is executed nicely. Love the music, the opening is better that the God Eater 2, but i still like God Eater Ressurection opening. When you encounter an Ashborn Aragami, the music will change, the insert song is awesome too. When the music is change, i feels like it a passive buff like in anime lol. Some detail in opening and in the main menu after clearing main story is sweet addition.

The are no free exploration in this game, you just can explore the mission area in one time, and if you done with your objective in mission, you just have 40 seconds before automatically return to base. There was an unfortunate cuz there is no Alisa and Nana anymore, but now there are Claire and Hilda. Hilda is not an AGE but gorgeus, Claire is an AGE that you can bring as your company. For animation in combat is more smooth, but you still cannot expect more about the interaction when outside combat/mission, of course it still better than previous series. And other a bit disturbing is you need to talk to NPC first before going to next mission. Why they just can make it auto?

There are much so much improvement in this game, the one most significant is in battle animation. For balancing, some features or loadout that that make you gain more buff is much added but in other side there was new type of Aragami that more dangerous because can use devour and deadly attack. It more simple than Monster Hunter and have it own difference, because of that too this game have it own identity and always make me like it since the first time i try God Eater series. I recommend it whatever your reason to try this. If you want play it before buy Monster Hunter, buy it. If you play it just because of Hilda, i can understand, just go for it. If you like Anime games with experience of Hunting a monster, kill them all. Or if you really want to experience what God Eater is, what the story, the plot, then make your first step.",1625058768,1625058768,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

(TL;DR at the bottom)

First things first, lets talk about the good parts of the game.

The combat is faster and more fluid combos are easier I feel, there are 2 new weapons, the biting edge and the heavy moon, which are unique and great to use. There's also the graphics, which is a huge leap from the last game, I play on the lowest setting (at the time of writing this review) because my pc is low end and it's still slightly better than the old games if not similar. The new Ash Aragami are weird, menacing and provide a fun new challenge to the game. There’s also this new type of mission called assault missions where you match with 7 other players to kill an Ash Aragami in 5 minutes, to me it was a new experience and I find it to be quite enjoyable, That's all I can say about the good parts.

Now lets talk about the bad parts.

The story of god eater 3 is ok (if not boring) for the first half and then it gets worse for the second half, you start off as some disposable slave, exist solely to kill aragami, and then climb your way to the top proving that you and your team is worth more than just that, while doing so you manage to build yourself a family in the new port. By the end of the first half you achieve your goal and it ends with a rather happy ending. Then the second half starts and you get reminded that this is still a god eater game, which means it tries to make a twist to make things more interesting but sadly it’s too short and not really explained well. It’s a big step down from the previous games.

Ok, maybe you’re not here to enjoy the story but rather for the weapons, outfits and other customization, lets get into that then. While the new weapons are great, unique and fun to use, they only have a few variations and god forbid if you like heavy moon since you’re getting the short end of the stick by having the fewest variations. They are although fucking overpowered in comparison to the older weapons. With the new weapons you can clear most single aragami mission in under 5 minutes and that’s without a proper strategy such as skills, burst arts and whatnot, just the weapon alone. Which makes any other content other than assault missions (plus the final boss) to be easy and I don’t feel much progression since from the start you’re already finishing the mission so fast. Also some blueprints for the weapons can only be obtained from optional missions instead of being unlocked when you get a higher tier material from the same aragami like in the previous games. Which makes the grind feel forced and serves only to make the game longer. 

Now lets talk about the other main reason why someone would want to buy and play this game, the Aragami. Think about one non generic and cool Aragami that you like, done ? chances are it’s not in this game. Other than the iconic flagship Aragami such as the Vajra, Hanmnibal, Dyaus Pita and Marduk form the previous game, most of the large Aragami from the previous game are gone. When I started playing the game with my friend I remembered hyping ourselves up for something like Ouroborous or Susano’o and how good they would look witht the new graphics and what new moveset they got considering how hard they beat us in the older games, but nope, apparently they’re not here. You might say that the new Ash Aragami are well worth not getting the older ones back, but I feel like “isn’t that the whole point of making a sequel ? to see recurring characters, weapons, Aragami from before? To see how the story progresses from the end of the last one?”, if they wanted to do this why not make something new? Were they scared that the game won’t sell unless it’s from the series? God eater is a franchise is already not so popular, especially in comparison to monster hunter and people usually called god eater as anime monster hunter or monster hunter with waifus, but enough of that. The lack of variety of Aragami also connects to the variety problem for the weapons.

This review has been long enough and honestly I’ve already talked about most of the stuff I want to say, so here’s some of my pet peeve for the game,

Soma being the only returning character from the old game as far as I remember, everybody else is dead, gone, or is now nonexsitent or something.

Burst arts are sadly a toned down version of the Blood arts from GE2RB, the predator style from Resurrection is also gone.

The team is somewhat loveable to me but most of the time they’re bland and fall to the generic anime character tropes/archetypes.

TL;DR 
don’t buy the game, it’s not worth it even at 80% off, use the money to buy KFC or something idk.
If you’re new to the series I recommend checking God eater 2 on steam it’s a two for one with God eater resurrection and is still cheaper than this.

+ super cool fighting system
+ various, very different weapons, guns, shields
+ customizable gameplay thanks to different effects and skills
+ decent to good story with cool characters, but don't expect too much
+ cool scenario and world
+ gameplay-loop keeps you hooked
+ lots of content and even free story campaigns for after the main story has ended
+ cool boss designs and intense fights

- the camera is plain bad: once close to a wall, the camera gets close to the char and hides him/her and the enemy
- you're sometimes forced to fight to enemies at once which is very frustrating due to the camera
- very view environments and some also add to the frustrating camera experience with tight corners etc.
- controls not that precise

IMPORTANT TIP: to offset the negatives a bit, make sure to use party-commands. Make them ""hold position"", so you can pull monsters into a certain area. Use ""disperse"" if you fight multiple enemies at once. And the last is letting them go to your location, so you can move them around the map without engaging the enemy.

Conclusion: great game, super addicting, fun to play but with a camera that could potentially make it annoying. So use the tips stated above and you shall have a lot of fun. ;)",1624719413,1624897049,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

The game is overall good although grind filled, as is the standard for the genre. Combat is flashy and the pacing is much faster/hectic for combat. The difficulty is meh, as you can pretty much solo the entire game if you so choose and as long as you do some basic gear upgrades the campaign is a cakewalk, the additional content although relatively easy as well does actually introduce some level of challenge. That being said the story is pretty good although cliche, but is enjoyable for those seeking their standard JRPG scenario games.

What really stands out in this game is the online and the ability to play everything cooperatively if you should so choose. Making your custom character then squading up with another batch of unique characters to slay some Aragami is a great treat. And even if you don't like online too much you can collect player cards to take those custom characters offline with you!

The first 6-7 missions are just there to introduce you to the various mechanics while allowing you a little bit of time ( a bit more wouldn't hurt to be honest ) to learn and remember them. The story is quite nice although your choices don't make much of a difference except for how you come across. The character customisation is quite nice you can be your favourite anime char ( like very similar ). But the main thing that made me fall in love with this game is the detailed combat system. It's quite different from other games and sometimes things are so fast that you need a minute to just understand what is going on but that too has a rush of its own which gives a very satisfactory feeling once its over. The different arts, weapon selection, guard, evasions and gun forms really knock it out of the park. The only thing that kinda made me sad is that the mouse camera controls are not at all good you can't even call them decent and when you compare them to the console camera controls it just breaks your heart. Even though the same game is running on two different machines the quality of gameplay varies a lot because the mouse camera controls makes it look as if the game is lagging and the pc version was not given any special kind of lock on system to make it convenient but if you can somehow get used to the camera controls its a ton of fun ( just don't watch the gameplay on a console and you will survive hopefully XD )",1624392746,1624392746,True,2,0,0.521136045455932617,0,True,False,False

[b][u]KB/M:[/u][/b] Not recommended if you get motion sickness and want to play with mouse and keyboad.  I'm not normally very sensitive to this type of thing in games, but the camera movement in your base is so floaty that it makes me nauseous.  It's a shame because the game is exactly what I wanted - mindless, flashy, quick combat and grindfest.  I'm not a fan of the slow and deliberate combat of MHW, but I like this game except for the camera.  I didn't see a way to adjust FOV in settings.

For $12 on the Bandai Namco sale, I'm not crushed.  Strangely, it's only the camera in your base and not the fighting areas that make me sick.  I hope they fix the camera in future installments.

The only other game that's made me nauseous is Nier on PS3.

[b][u]Controller:[/u][/b] Camera works fine on controller.  My work around is to use the controller in the base and then KB/M when fighting.

[b][u]Other Thoughts:[/u][/b] Combat is similar to the Tales of franchise, but more basic from the little I've played.  Striking enemies is satisfying and has good weight to the hits.  

Story seems to be mediocre anime fluff, and it's just barely enough to keep me somewhat interested.  The levels are like 2 minutes long and then there's like a 5 minute cutscene every time you finish a story mission.  It doesn't flow well with the type of game and seems weird and forced. Being made to run around the ship to talk to people to advance the story is kind of a pain with the floaty camera. [Edit: Now that I'm about 6 hours in and have Phym, the story has gotten significantly better]

Your squad is surprisingly good in this game! I've gotten plenty of heals from them, especially after editing their skills, they revive me fast, and they actually do damage!  A few times, I've wandered off to pick up loot and they'll have killed the trash before I can reach it.

Graphics-wise, it kinda reminds me of an old PS3 game, but the effects are so flashy that it's not super noticeable in the long run, and the boss fights more than make up for it.

I definitely would not pay full price for this game, but for $25 or less it's fun, and $12 is an absolute steal.",1624182465,1624271135,True,0,0,0.486486494541168213,0,True,False,False

People can debunk me however they want, but there’s no denying God Eater 3 took some inspiration from Transformer: Devastation (with a hidden bonus of Dragon Dogma, which is the best part that I’ll get to), so to start with Transformer: Devastation and God Eater 3:

-Both two has the same inventory management problems (too much space to store weapons in Devastation, too much space to store Abandoned God Arcs), regardless of the fact that you would simply not care about this and just wanna play the damn game.

-Both two offers a game mechanics that can save your life in a fight (Perfect Guard for God Eater 3, Perfect Dodge for Transformer: Devastation)

-Both two has you using the same combo moves (Devastation’s Melee Fight Moves and God Eater 3’s Burst Art) over and over to make it effective. (I can understand if people get tired of that, but there’s clever strategy to doing so, like in Crimson Ashland missions that requires Consecutive Attacks or vehicle attack in Transformer)

And both two has characters (Autobots and Decepticons in Devastation and the Chrysanthemum crew in GE3) you can get invested in and be satisfied, in comparison to the literal nameless characters in MHW.

As a whole though, one thing God Eater 3 does do better is it’s HIDDEN SQUAD MECHANICS, that behaves the EXACT WAY as the Pawn System in Dragon Dogma. It’s hard to achieve on the PC since you need to save scum a lot in dummy accounts as the player, but it’s there, and it’s practically better than Dragon Dogma in every way (Your squadmates are more reactive, they’re far more helpful in healing, and they don’t stand around like idiots and can even PUNISH the monster without my presence, they’re THAT good)

So yeah, I love God Eater 3 and it’s taken so much that I love about Transformer: Devastator, being made better with a hidden, but solid Dragon Dogma squad mechanics.

Comparing it to Monster Hunter is stupid, compare MHW to Dragon Dogma and Transformer: Devastation first and tell me if there’s similarities in the end. 

I would still love the freedom of God Eater 3 to the better end.",1624099064,1624099064,True,8,1,0.491231083869934082,4,True,False,False

I'm well aware that this game is pretty much similar to monster hunter and with its own twist but I'm gonna make comparison between this game and mhw just to give an example of what makes this game really bad and my comparisons are only for the cons, not pros. 

[b]First up the good. PROS[/b]
1. Anime style graphic.
2. Companions can have different builds according to how you build them.
3. You get to have new game +
4. You can recreate your character anytime after beating the main story.

[b]Now for a long list of CONS. [/b]
[h1]1. Map [/h1]
You're playing the same exact map for the entire game with the exception of the final boss. Imagine that there is only 1 map in mhw, size of the map is twice as large and each mission is only as big as one section of a map. That is it.

[h1]2. Tedious tutorial missions [/h1]
Each part or feature of a gameplay is locked behind countless tutorial missions that you must go through.

[h1]3. Unskippable end credit[/h1]
Very self explanatory.

[h1]4. No iframe when you get hit[/h1]
In mhw, when you got hit and get knocked back, there is iframe to protect you from getting combo-ed to death. This game does not have that iframe after getting hit. Which means, you can get hit again while getting knocked back and during the time you are knocked back, you cant do anything. This will lead to guaranteed death. No.4 itself is no big deal but if you combine this with No.5, this becomes a big deal.

[h1]5. Enemies aka Aragami [/h1]
Aragamis in this game are mostly artificial difficulty unlike mhw.

[b]A) Aragami's attacks[/b]
You have no way to react to their attacks. Their attack animation are as fast as a speed of light, has a huge @ss hitbox as big as an entire screen and they have nearly 0 wind up time. For those who played mhw, you guys should remember AT Nergigante's pepega slam/spam slam. Now imagine most of the Aragamis from mid to late game each have 2-4 moveset similar to Nergigante's pepega slam. That is what you will be dealing with. Or using another example, these Aragamis will be attacking constantly just like Rajang in mhw, except their attacks can 1 or 2 shot you, also keep in mind you will be dealing with No.4 I mentioned above.

[b]B) Mid-Late game its mostly 2v1[/b]
You will be fighting 2 enemies in one fight starting from mid game. Sure mhw had this as well but here is the catch, unlike mhw, all Aragamis are allies with each other. Combining this with No.4 and No.5A, you get a near impossible fight to win. Keep in mind, I don't use companions unless the story forces me to.

[b]C) Aragami OHKO attacks[/b]
In mhw, only a few monsters have that OHKO move and these monsters are mostly endgame content. But you will be dealing with Aragami OHKO attacks from mid-late game content, not endgame content.

I finally manage to finish the main story, but I did not bother doing the optionals and am not gonna bother with the rest of the content.",1623950104,1623950104,False,9,9,0.431116074323654175,0,True,False,False

1.Really Difficult
2.Beautiful Graphics
3.Decent Story
4.Decent amount of content.

Cons:
1.Extremely Repetitive: 
They have only a handful of maps (maybe 10-15) similar to a large arena which then gets reused in a rotating manner over and over again for around 140 main missions which gets boring QUICK. (entire game is played between a sanctuary and an arena-sized area)

1.2:  They also have only a handful of enemy and boss models throughout the game. There is no Unique boss model where you feel like really battling it out. Over the course of the game, you are gonna kill the same boss enemies and normal enemies a ridiculous amount of times. 

2. Combat is not fluent: 
In an active reactive combat experience such as this, i expect to be able to block/dodge an incomming attack on command. which is not possible. if you start an attack, you cannot avoid an incomming attack until said animation of yours has finnished.

3. Completly lacking the sense of progress:
There is no healthbar on the enemies so you can't really tell how strong the enemy is. While you do get stronger weapons yourself over the course of the game, i would guess the enemies get stronger at about the same rate because i didnt feel like there was much difference between the first bossfight compared to the last. The only difference i can think of is that in late game, you get multiple bosses per map instead of a single one.

3.2: there is NO correlation between each mission to kill monsters and the storyline. Regardless of whether the quest say you're going to save someone, chase after a bad guy, stop the real antagonist , collect a valuable resource, you don't see them while on the quest. you simply kill the same monsters over and over again, and then the progress to the story happens in the cutscene.

4: Difficult bordeline too difficult. (maybe im just a baddie, so consider this part a very personal opinion)
In games like these, you're supposed to get visual queues for when the enemy is about to do its next attack.
Well for this game i'd like to say that for some of their attacks, their queues are so vague and short that it feels like an instant attack. which forced me to play a very safe and boring playstyle (dip in and dip out) And even more so because of reason nr 2: ^

Verdict: Very Tedious Combat Simulator with no correlation or sense of buildup to anything. 
Would i recommend this game? NO! not even if it was the only game on steam.

The best way to describe it is, monster hunter lite, with more emphasis on fast combat and mobility, just select a mission, enter the arena kill the boss, EAT HIM for materials, watch a cutscene on how the story plays out, rinse and repeat, no wasting 20 minutes looking literally shit and leaves to find the monster, if you are okay with that, welcome to God Eater.

The combat on this iteration is a more polished version of the GE2RB combat, with new added skills to your weapon attacks, a new mobility option to move around faster, two new weapons and few new mechanics, the story is serviceable, nothing life changing, the characters as tradition with the series are the focus of the game, later on you can unlock mini episode to know more about them which is always welcome.

If you are a fan of GE you will like this game, if you are can't stand MH stone movement and want something faster you may like it, a very niche game surely but I enjoy my time with it.

+ Fast-paced combat
+ Memorable Companions 
+ No MicroTransaction
+ Major cutscene had epic moments
+ Not Grindy 
+ Not hard as Dark Souls 
+ Easy to master the combat 
+ Plenty of outfits and weapons
+ Everything unlocked by playing the game

[h1] Cons Of The Game [/h1]

- You play as a mute lunatic who only talks one time in the game and deliver the world most cringiest line.
- No widescreen support 
- So game allows you to make decisions but they dont have a impact on the world or the story
- Hugo was totally annoying and was one of the worst Leader ever
- Story sometimes didnt make sense and left you with more questions than answers
- Game felt tedious and annoying. In order to progress the game and unlock new weapons and GodEater to fight story had to be completed. I  didnt mind doing story i was engaged sometimes but the way they handled the story missions poorly which took the experience away and some times i didnt felt like continue playing. To progress had to fight same type of enemies at least ten time in different maps in order to progress.

Overall: 6/10
If you like Anime and Monster Hunter: Buy it on DISCOUNT
If you just want to try ""Monster Hunter"" style game: just buy Monster Hunter
Not really grindy but definitely has to farm certain materials to craft weapons and etc.

Graphics/ Animation: 7/10
There is a lot of cutscenes and are mostly using the game art style/ engine so it may not be the best. However, from time to time there will be very good ""anime"" style cutscenes that is just top notch. Everything is voice acted and animated, so it's a pretty good anime game. 

Combat: 7/10
Combat is pretty good, you have simple combos, variety of weapons, guns, shields. Each weapons can have different skills/ move set that makes it even more different and diverse. You can try every single weapon without the needed to do any pre-requisite/quests. From what I heard, it is similar to ""Monster Hunter"" that you hit the monter's parts, break it and it will be take more damage for that part and so on. 

Gameplay: 5/10
You spend most of the time watching cutscenes or in battle. The maps are extremely limited. You just keep playing the same map over and over again even though you are at the highest rank. The worst part is that the combat does not link/connect with the story. Ex. you have to travel to a certain place to save a certain person, you will have to fight at a map that you have played for a million times and somehow during the cut scenes you would appear in a different place. It's just not consistent from the combat to the story.

Story: 5/10
You play as a role of God Eater killing monsters and at the same time you are a father. It is an okay story, not very exciting or sad or scary. It does not explore much of other character's story, just very brief and short. Not very good but cannot be considered as bad.",1621355765,1621355765,False,1,0,0.483516484498977661,0,True,False,False

However the gameplay is the best imo, it's more fast paced and fluid. It no longer has the OP and broken Blood Rage mechanic, it has a better Blood Art (Burst Art) system, which allows for larger build diversity and it features Ashborn Aragami, which are really fun to fight. There's also the new Engage mechanic, which is alright. Only thing I'm missing are the Predator Styles from Resurrection.

Compared to Monster Hunter, I think the entire series is much better gameplay wise. Sadly not nearly as much content though, so that's the one huge plus I give MH games. There are no annoying micromanagement item mechanics like weapon sharpening, stamina increasements, hot/cold drinks, paintballs etc. The only micromanagement there is is keeping up and leveling your burst gauge, which is actually really engaging and fun because it's part of combat and not just something you do after running away from a monster so you can take 5 fûcking seconds to consume a single item. lol There's also no RNG mechanics like getting stunned after taking a bunch of hits, monster attacks without a wind-up (walking is not a fûcking attack, Capcom) or monster attacks that chain into you because you aren't given enough time to dodge/block and you end up dying as a result. So I'd say the combat is more skill based than in MH. Hitboxes are also better. And there's no stupid gathering quests, even though there still are items you gather around the maps, it's nowhere near as much as in any MH game. The gameplay feels more aggressive and much more fast paced (especially in GE3) and not as sluggish, but still sluggish enough so that you have to commit into your combo and can't easily dodge out of it, like you can in Dark Souls, for example (which makes sense in DS, but wouldn't work well in a Hunter-like). The combat is also MUCH more vertical, which allows for more interesting monster design (and flying monsters are actually fun to fight unlike in MH). Weapons still have tech to them and monsters have different hitzones, just like in MH, and compared to MHGU specifically you could say Burst Arts are the God Eater equivilant to Hunter Styles (not Hunter Arts!). And finally, God Eater companions are 500% smarter than Palicos, even though they're still kinda dumb sometimes. One minor thing MH has going for it is more interesting map designs (especially World, of course).

I originally got into GE because of it's connection to Code Vein (also an awesome game) and all 3 games were a lot of fun. Played GE3 on the Switch first, then bought it again on PC. The biggest issue I have with it is its lack of content. There's a lot of missions, sure, but once you've done them there's no postgame. NG+ technically exists but it's the same difficulty as NG, so really it doesn't exist at all unfortunately. An NG+ system like that of Dark Souls or Code Vein would greatly increase this games playtime, so I hope that will be a feature if they ever make GE4. Or some other form of endless mode or whatever, not just missions that you'll eventually run out of. Also I'm not a fan of the entire anime aesthetic, it's pretty cringe tbh and the story of all 3 games is utter trash (GE2 was funny, at least), but the gameplay makes up for it, just like it does in Code Vein.",1621176332,1621176982,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like MHW but struggle to run it smoothly, GE3 is significantly less demanding. I am using a laptop with 840M and having a blast.

Multiplayer is very, very smooth. There are a lot of connection problem in MHW, but in GE3 you barely notice the difference with single player. Very enjoyable.

The last time I played God Eater is the first one in the PSP. I enjoy the newer weapon and the burst arts. They give so many personalization option even for same weapon. I wish they let you make a preset for Burst Arts as well. There's deep skill customization here but I haven't delve into them deep enough.

- Combat system is anime-fast and LOUD and allows you to be reckless, which is a lot of fun
- The bots make me feel like I'm in a team instead of a solo hunter with a helper
- Some things have complicated names but most systems are easy to grasp
- Missions are so quick (5-10min) that the ""just one more mission"" feeling happens frequently

The bad:
- It takes a while before the battles really become mechanically interesting, where you have to observe enemy patterns
- The game tricks you into watching an anime, and people say it's a bad one at that. I can't compare since I'm not into anime but I didn't hate it, it just got in the way sometimes—when the game won't let you go in missions because you need to go and talk to specific NPCs because plot it's specially irritating.

I played this game when it came out on PS4 (Japanese ver.), but I'm not proficient with Japanese enough to follow the whole story. Only got 60% of the story at best when I beat the game and felt that there simply was not enough content in the game, at that time the game was like a 5/10, didn't really live up to my hype for it.

Then I got the steam version a few days ago during the sale for about 8 USD. Decided to play it again for the lore and also check out if there's new content. Now that I can understand the whole story, I'm pretty OK with it. There are some very obvious plot holes and can be done better for sure, but overall acceptable. There are also free content updates in game too which makes me pretty happy already. After finishing the main story (not including add-on stories) I think the game is a 7/10 for me.

After finishing the main story, I delve into new story missions which I have no prior knowledge. I was pleasantly surprised as these missions were designed to complete the world setting and flush out the characters. The last episode of Soma is great and makes this game finally feels complete. These new story add-ons also lays foundations for the next game which hypes me up, can't wait to see the old crew from GEB again. After finishing all the story, I think the game is a 8-9/10 for me.

There are some anime bullshit in the plot but the world setting and overall story is pretty interesting. It shows how low humans can be during the end of the world but also shows the struggle to not lose hope and the will to fight for a better future.

Gameplay wise, custom ammo for ranged form has been nerfed so can't spam them anymore, but that's a good thing if you enjoy melee combat more than pew-pewing like me.

Looking from all of God Eater game til this one i feel like... nothing have changed, The game feel like they just recycled the old game. I just want to see the changed of this franchise that make me feel like its changed.

Still this is a pretty fun game to grab if you feel like it or you can save for other games you want (  'v')b

While the story is nothing to write home about, being fairly generic, the combat (weapons, skills, etc) is honestly quite addicting, being fast and action-packed (Though this is nothing new for games of this 'Hunter' genre), especially against the bigger, faster and stronger Arigami.

Character Customization is, in my opinion, fairly limited upon starting a new game, with more outfits and accessories being unlocked through story progression and side missions, though I'd say these items are worth if you're a fan of the brooding, edgy and punk-ish fashion style (Definitely worth if you love electrical tape on most of the outfits).

Other reviews have detailed the game so I'll just give my thoughts on why I like it and who it might be for. The combat feels great in GE 3 comared to the first 2, and with the different weapons and burst arts and accel triggers there's a lot of moveset variety. The main thing for me is that there aren't a lot of fast paced games that play like this and I really enjoy them. If you like Devil May Cry, Guilty Gear/BlazBlue then you will probably like this. If you would rather play Dark Souls, Street Fighter then play Monster Hunter instead. I feel like that analogy sums it up pretty well for me. And they added a bunch of free post launch missions and episodes and some Aragami. No Alisa tho :(

The most annoying thing is the stupid aragami child, honestly I don't get this character being so annoying with the baby talk and literally attached to your hip in the ship, I can overlook it because its just in the hub and the cinematics but it's still not a positive thing. So weird to combine high speed monster killing with a parenting simulator but whatever.

I liked this game a lot, but don't expect anything special from it - anything besides our cute little surprise won't change your life.

 One of the best parts of this game is the fighting system which gives the player a lot of flexibility when it comes to choosing a playstyle. The plot is also good but the best part (in my opinion) is after you finish the main storyline because you will get a lot more character development. There are also different game modes like time trial or challenge missions which you unlock after some playtime.
 On the flip side, there are only a few maps, and you'll know them from start to finish after a while and there  aren't many unique enemies types 

Overall, I recommend this God Eater 3 if you like this style and genre of games.

- pretty easy to get into as a newcomer since you have a lot of retrys on a monster and npc assistance

Downsides:
- pretty limited number of monsters and maps so you will kill the same monster multiple times during a playthrough
- if you want to farm a specific weapon you pretty much need an external side to know what materials drop where
- online multiplayer is pretty much dead but you get bots to help with online missions called assault",1617302851,1617302851,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do you care about story in your game?

Give this one a skip. The world may be interesting but the script is so laughably terrible you'll be wondering why you're even bothering listening to the scenes. The absolute worst aspect of this is the pacing of it all. For the first five ranks of story missions you're basically setting up the world, your characters, why you're special and what you're going to do to save the world. You can maybe go 3 story missions between cutscenes with perhaps 3 minutes of terribly scripted dialogue setting up something tiny before going through another 2 or 3. This isn't counting optional missions. Rank 6 and 7 are where ending 1 and ending 2 happen, the first being so... terribly done it feels utterly incomplete. Like the previous 4 ranks of story missions could have simply been condensed into a few minutes more of cutscenes or just 1 rank of missions if paced properly. The true ending is so predictable, cliche myself and my boyfriend called it from the moment the plot in rank 6 happened. Voice actors did a fine job of trying to present it well but even then, there's only so much they can do.

Except for you, Phym. You make me want to rip my ears off and subsequently everyone else's around me so they do not need to be subject to that *god awful* voice.

Do you value Gameplay?

Give this a skip. Why? It's painfully basic. The combat has some nice elements, freedom of movement, different weapon styles and choices but... lacking any ability to combo. Every mechanic is basically an additional effect to your pre-existing basic attack, which don't encourage experimentation or even combos between X and Y attacks. Just spam one combo attack. The difficulty curve as well is terrible, the entire game is a cakewalk with 0 challenge. The most challenge you'll encounter is being combo'd by big monsters against a wall with no recovery window. Guess what? You can do the very same back to them. Knock them down, spam to win, you've killed every big enemy and boss within 2 minutes. Yes, I am not joking. 2 minutes per monster if you knocked them down and combo, which the game encourages. Most of the time? Less, because that's also factoring in travel time to the monster.

The game has, I believe, 6-7 maps and that's spread over 70 or so missions including optional missions. The missions also have a terrible variety of monsters as well, so you'll be seeing the same ones again, again, again, again and again. There's two monsters you only see once though, for some baffling reason.

Do you like music?

Listen to it on YouTube, it's baller. No joke, great work on the music.

Just don't listen to it in game. It's hard to feel invested in a sad scene when the music playing in the background is basically 
Beethoven going HAM on a piano.

Do you like epic songs?

Fights are dynamic, fast paced, boss movesets are predictable but complex to align with your own, pays to be prepared and to min/max things.
It makes you feel like a fucking god. It takes the adrenaline rush and feeling of power of games as God of War and Doom while still letting you know you're fighting a thing 3 times your size that could rip you to pieces in the blink of an eye.
If there is anything bad about this game is that the learning curve is a bit harsh for newcomers to the genre and the AI for teammates fluctuates between potatoe and gaming-god-tier.

Story is mushy cheezy anime nonsense, i skipped most of it to grind out the game, took me 40 hours to do every mission that popped up during main story stuff.  

maybe the heavy moon is broken? i typically pick a weapon and stick to it but i didnt really have to change my weapon (stayed with same upgrade tree whole game) , or shield or gameplay style, or even use that many items like traps or potions for the duration of the first 40 hours. 

theres 3 damage types, slash, crush, pierce, and you pick a melee and ranged weapon. Heavy moon does mostly slash and some crushing, and lazer beam ranged weapon does only piercing, so i had all the basis covered, theres clearly some enemies weaker to certain damage types.

Bandai Namco's first-party games tend to follow the same guidelines, so to speak. Recognizable character designs, enjoyable combat, serviceable or shallow everything else. This is no exception.

In fact, people who played Code Vein might see away too many similarities at what is done right and what is done wrong.

There’s always the illusion of a grand world and a constant hint of the possibility of it becoming something far greater, but it doesn’t. And that kind of represents the game as a whole.

Enough stuff is there to keep you somewhat invested, but it’s all shallow or pretends to have depth despite the fact that an unfortunate good chunk of it is tossable junk.

- Combat’s okay, if dare I say it can even be good, but customization is bloated without a reason other than to provide more grind.

- Map design attempts to show the theme of your current location in the world and there is somewhat of a visual variety, but no functional variety whatsoever.

- Enemies start out intimidating but get recycled fast to the point of becoming a joke.

- Characters all look memorable at first glance, but then they open their mouth.

- You get to customize your own character, pick your own weapon, choose your own way to fight, even make some meaningless dialogue choices, but you NEVER feel like the story is about you even if it constantly pretends to be. Even in Monster Hunter World you feel like the story is more about you than in this game, and you interact LESS with others in that game.

- Not to mention the story is the usual “teenage-looking younglings win with the power of friendship” nonsense.

I think the best moment of summarizing what’s wrong with the game is, of all times, during an anime-style cutscene a few hours in. It leads to the start of a mission you are doing. You and two others are supposedly on your way to help one of your team members who’s trying to lure a monster to fight. It keeps the focus for most of the cutscene on one of the characters, the one luring, and you get to see some fast-paced action that’s good enough. After the monster’s lured, the two characters you are with look at each other and rush to assist. There’s the issue, at that moment… You are not there.

Not that they could animate a scene so many times as to cover all possible looks, but it shows where the focus of the developers is, and it’s not on you, the player. They could have not made it 2D but do it with the in-game graphics like they had done everything up to that point, but they specifically chose to do that which would look more interesting as a product than what would be better for a game.

It’s kind of sad at the end of the day, for it IS a good product, meaning that work was put into it to make it a good product, but I bought a video game, so I expect a good video game instead.",1611245159,1611245159,False,43,9,0.661509394645690918,0,True,False,False

- variants of clothing ad nearly nothing (GE3 adds more FlexTape and has only 4 colors per outfit)
- only kill missions (MHW you have collects and capture missions for different approaches)
- story telling is boring and rpedictable (seems normal with these games... go for ""Toukiden - Kiwami"" for story!)

- Multi-Missions where you can not save in between!

Looks: Decent, nothing amazing but not bad either.

Story: Poorly made. Too much does not make sense. Heros in the game are called AGES which are human modified to fight against threat against humans. Yet they are treated as slaves and worse. People hate them because they have been modified to be closer to monsters. But they are made so they fight for humans? AGEs can fight giant monsters and do super hero like actions. But they are afraid of firing squad? So many holes in the story, after first hour, I gave up trying to keep up with story of even cared.

Buttons are mapped all wrong. Everything need combo of button to do. i e. block is RB + B. Spend time with button mapping or you will have bad time. 

Game play is fine, with the right skills equipped. you can do some amazing stuff. lock on is pretty bad. Camera sticks to mob but your hero is not locked in. Takes some orientation to understand there your hero is compared to mobs. Which is very annoying considering mobs fly/knock out character/burrow in ground. Will spend half the fight chasing mob on screen than anything else.

Gameplay-wise it's about mediocre to leaning on bad in my opinion since you can ignore almost every system the game has and just mash attack and evade with the occasional block for AoE attacks; seriously you just have to dodge and keep your burst gage up during combat. The game also needs more enemy variety beyond the three or four fodder enemies and the five or six larger enemies with different colors for each element they use; I get that games need to reuse assets now and then due to budget constraints but when you fight one monster and in the very next mission you fight the same monster but now blue because its dealing ice damage and now has a couple of new moves, it feels kind of lazy to be honest.

Speaking of moves, some monster variants have these dreaded instant moves created for interrupting and irking you when you're in the middle of a combo and while some monsters have visual tells for when they're about to use such a move, others don't; and this becomes an extremely annoying gameplay issue when playing in the more advanced missions where enemies can 1-hit-kill you. If I'm going to get 1-hit-killed by an enemy I want it to be because I was a huge moron and got greedy with a combo, not because the AI suddenly decided it was time to reduce my number of continues in the quest, couple this with a god awful camera (both lock-on and regular camera) and you're fighting two enemies in every quest.

VAJRA ASS IS MY FETISH!!). 

~ The main story is good, but not amazing. I cant deny that the main story is a bit boring for me at first, after that...well, okay (Sadly, there too many holes in the story). In the end, GE1/GER main story is still my favorite in this series. 

~ The control is a bit different from previous series, but if you are used to it, it will be easier later.

~ If this game was hard for u, dont worry, NPC's in this game will easily carry you. compared to the previous series, i find NPC's in this game is more smarter (note: friendly fire is not an isue anymore /i'll miss unique NPC's like Kanon lol)

It wanted to be a more fast paced hack and slash monster hunter, but the game only allows you to carry 3 combo for the melee weapon and a range weapon that you can fire for about 5 seconds without going back to melee again. 
There are far too many system that may make you think that the game is deep but it really isn't. Chain link, burst aid, acceleration trigger, god artifact all of them is just a button you push to basically make your character better. Link aid allows you to do the combo you equip and the rest is just makes your character better at combat through stat change, nothing like changing up your playstyle or anything. In combat you basically juggle through all which makes you think the game is strategic but it's just the same loop over and over again.

All the monster require the same approach and very rarely spice up your tactic. I really hate how some monster has the same animation to do different attack, making you can't anticipate which attack are they going to use. Due to the fast paced monster, you probably thought they make it so that the camera is good or that the map is open wide. Nope, the lock on camera is trash if you melee the monster and most of the area is a long narrow hallway. Like what's the point of making the monster traverse through different part of the map? All they do is just prolong the combat since all they do is just go to a fountain to heal.  Snowy, Volcano, Ruined City, Dessert they are all just window dressing that provide nothing other than ""yeah it's cool to look at"". Also, I hate how each mission just finish in 5 minutes and there are multiple repeat mission where you fight the same thing but harder (boost up their health and attack, rarely add new attack). Like come on, make the fight a little longer but delete the repeat.
Fighting with AI is ok and most of the time they do all the work. Story is the most cringiest and animey plot I have experienced in a long while. It doesn't provide anything interesting or anything, your character is literally the chosen one trope but doesn't have any active participation through the story. You are forced to watch cool cutscene and not you know, play them. 
Also, [spoiler] WHY THE FUCK DO YOU CARE ABOUT PHYM, IT'S A GODDAMN ARAGAMI THAT LURES OTHER ARAGAMI! ARAGAMI! THE THING THAT YOU HAVE BEEN KILLING ALL THIS TIME. [/spoiler] 

Some positive though:
+ Music is pretty good, albeit repetitive (looking at you hub music)
+Bullet customization (while I heard it was dumbed down from previous game) was pretty fun for somebody who comes from monster hunter series.
+ Combat is flashy and looks good on trailer, has as much depth as Nier Automata, which is a puddle.

I don't understand the vision they are aiming with this game. It wanted to be a hack and slash boss rush but the fight was too short and some enemy attack felt cheap due to it not well telegraphed.
So if they are going to make God Eater 4, I want them to take this question to heart:

Why:

- Cringy poor teenage ""history"", not relevant and not interesting.
- Poor graphics, from 10 years back. Too much effects that affect your attention in the fights.
- Bad AI, your companions are almost useless (they get devoured all the time, that make monsters more powerful)
- Bad hitboxes, no inv frames in evades, just block, and block sucks
- Monster spam same skills over and over, specially in hard modes (dash/charge, sweep, jump, area attack, and so on - they dont have stamina or limits)
- Bad tells from monsters, sometimes is very hard to see whats happens next, cause of millions effects in the screen or the bad camera position (narrow passages, etc), or because you dont have time to evade or block, most of the time, cause your character are slower than 100000 ton monsters.
- Maps sucks, they are useless, just arenas to fight with no meaning, just to get some items over the place
- Grindy as phoock, but its part of the style i guess
- No multiplayer anymore so good luck relying on your companions...

Take caution in the very standard writing for Shonen style anime and the tropes for those who can't handle it.The game is easy if you try, and balancing can be shattered with a little thought but it's fun for the whole run.

Full Review-

If you like Monster Hunter and you like anime, this is pretty solid. Very simple gameplay with some depth added through a system of munching on the monsters mid fight, some decent AI and a revival system that makes it incredibly difficult to ever fail a mission, it's a very solid experience in the Hunter-genre of games. A far more casual approach to it compared to the Monster Hunter Series, this one brings a few new weapons to the mix from previous titles.

A handful of new weapons have been added, and some new mechanics, one of which is the ever overpowered ""Burst Arts' system, which lets you customize your playstyle even further beyond just your weapon choice. 

Armor plays no role in this game beyond purely being for fashion, so make your waifu or husbando of choice and go for it.

The story is a standard anime affair, but it does it's job. Voice-acting is solid and delivered well, fairly typical Shonen style writing but nothing unbearable. Standard 'Friendship is best ship"" style story.

 Been a fan of the franchise since the first one, this one does not disappoint. 

I do have a personal warning / headsup. I have 100% completion, and I did so with the starter weapon. I only upgraded the first weapon you get, and never changed it to anything else. I ended up doing the highest damage of anyone I played with on raids as well as in hunts with friends. I also built my playstyle around being fast and hard hitting. What ended up happening is I made a set-up built on Attack Speed and nothing else, which in turn destroyed the balance of the game. What was supposed to be a Great Sword with big meaty swings and a charge up swing mechanic, became a dagger. I melted every monster by playing like I was playing dark Souls, stagger-locking and solo'ing every beast with almost 0 effort and the same strategy employed for every single beast once I discovered the method.

A word of caution, don't expect anything challenging if you're a veteran to hunter games. Go in and have fun, maybe break the game for fun, but expect some light-hearted hunting/ boss fighting fun.",1549770988,1606593437,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

A lot of the same things that were loved from the first two games were carried over, but additional Aragami have been added, as well as two new melee weapon types: Biting Edge, a pair of daggers that can be combined into a glaive, and Heavy Moon. Having previously played the Variant Scythe in past games, I decided to main the Biting Edge this time around. It is a low skill floor, high skill ceiling weapon, relying on knowing which form to use, when to use, stamina usage, etc. Overall a fun but challenging new weapon to master.

The story is about par for the course with God Eater: There, important, but not absolutely essential to enjoy the game. There's mostly new faces from the previous games, with one or two surprises thrown in. There's more world-building, and the outlook is both bleaker but more hopeful at the same time. The characters aren't groundbreakers, but they also are more than just a simple archetype. Out of the ones you spend time with, there will most likely be at least one you end up loving and always have on your team.

While this is the first God Eater not made by Shift, the new developers did a good job of keeping the core of the game while adding in some new mechanics. The only downside I can think of at the moment is that the post-game stories that require building up a ""resonance rate"" with characters make you just grind out some missions with the characters in your party. Not a major gripe, but if you do every mission as it becomes available like I did, it's just a span of repeating old missions to raise the resonance rate.

If you're super fond of the original GE story like me, GE3's story will feel more like a reboot than a sequel, but that's just nitpicking I guess.
Also, lots of mechanics have been removed, such as Rage Burst and Aragami Bullets (no one used them afaik lol), Link Burst bullets are now limited, weapons skills were reworked into Burst Plugins which are only active in burst, custom bullets no longer consume OP and are now limited to a set quantity of ammo depending on how complex/powerful is the bullet, and much more.

Thus it is essentially useless, and for some ungodly reason you cannot rebind many of the options- you can’t rebind actions to left and right sticks, like 5 of the important actions are bound together. Running and change weapon form are the same button.  
edit: seems like a year later they finally patched alot of these controller issues. still requires a controller to play effectively. Best to treat it as a single player expereince because thats all you getting. Ai companions are good enough i guess


They claimed this installment was to bring the game from handheld to the consoles/pc, clearly has not worked very well because they haven't changed jack shit. This is not only reflected in the controls but also the graphics , models, effects, and UI. Looks like it was built for a handheld title and clearly runs like it. If they wanted to emulate MHW successes they should’ve took pages from capcom's book - actually integrate modern control options.

It's a damn shame - underneath all this archaic bullshit there's a solid game there, however, it’s just too much work trying to put up with how dated the game looks and feels.

First the good things this game has done:
-Switchable audio, one of the things I wished the two previous entries should've had. The previous entries had some abysmal English dubbed characters which made me wish there was an option to switch to the Japanese voices. But surprisingly, the second good thing this game has done, the English dub was on par with the Japanese dub. I was set on playing this game in Japanese dub but decided to give the English dub a chance and ended up playing it in English all through out the story.
-Shield Diving, a new mechanic that I instantly love. This mechanic really changed the way you traverse the map and fight. As someone who's accustomed to the usual way you play from the first two games, being able to use shield dive made stepping a joke. Moreover, it made exploring the map less of a chore.
-The Engage, Burst Art and Acceleration trigger system. A nice mechanic for the game, it's somewhat similar to the blood art/blood rage system of God Eater 2.
-Assault missions. Just being able to fight alongside 7 more people is a blast.
-Melee Training room. getting the chance to master/try Burst arts and your current god arc's move set before actual combat is very handy for beginners.
-Hearing Amy welcome you back every mission. It's pretty nice to hear someone welcome you back or cheer you up after every mission.
-The ability to replenish your consumable items with one press of a button. Makes stocking healing items faster and more convenient. Moreover, depleted item stocks after missions do not disappear in your inventory so you don't have to keep reorganizing your items everytime you use up one item after a mission.
-Idle animations during missions. Getting to see everyone in your party rest their God Arcs when you're just standing still made the characters feel more human.
-Blueprints. It made optional missions worth something other than just being filler missions for farming.
-Movable camera outside missions. Something the two previous games lack, getting the chance to see every nook and cranny of the caravan was something I wish the two previous games had.
-Shorter reward screen. Being able to see everything you've received in one screen was better than having to spam through reward screens from the previous games.
-+1 & +2 Abandoned God Arcs not being bound to one type of weapon. It really compensates for the lack of not having the ability to have skills for improving the drop / amount of Abandoned God Arcs you receive after a mission.
-Hope the Vagrant Merchant and Faith the Merchant. Even though they're just very minor side characters,  it's nice to see glimpses of their respective backgrounds through the cast's occasional banter about them or from the tips during loading screens. Moreover, letting Hope sell Abandoned God Arcs and cheaper healing items really helps sometimes.
-SSS ranks granting an increased reward rate. It made striving for an SSS rank worth something more than just being bragging rights.
-The story. I loved the story and wished there was more. The main story was rather short compared to the previous two games but the extra story compensates for that.
-Phym. Enough said.

The mixed feelings I have with the game:
-Splitting healing items into two types. Steady and instant heal. Though I don't really mind them nerfing the heals, it could easily eat almost half (or more) of your item space. 
-Just Guard's new effects. Though the new just guard still grants you no damage when you successfully perform them, the previous two games had Abandoned God Arcs that granted the ability to recover HP,OP and SP when you successfully land a Just Guard.
-God Arcs having different Abandoned God Arc part slots. Unlike the previous two games that had a staple 4 slots for all weapons, this game gives each god arc different number of slots. You really have to pick which one to sacrifice when choosing what weapon you'll ultimately settle on using.
-Losing the option to enable perilous missions. I personally loved the ability to increase the difficulty of a certain mission but sadly it's gone in this game.
-The emotes. Some were improved and some became worse.
-Aragami bullets don't drop after devours anymore. They're just link burst rounds now, though I don't really mind that much, but keeping aragami bullets would've helped compensate for the gun nerfs.
-[spoiler]Extra story cliff hanger ending. I really love the story but ending everything with a cliff hanger really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.[/spoiler]

Lastly, bad things this game has done:
-Graphics options don't have much customizability for people that have weak PCs.
-Nerfing guns super hard. Not only was the Blast gun replaced by the rail gun but also custom bullets no longer consume OP, there's a limit to how many custom bullets you can now shoot. It has really crippled God Eaters that have a gunner play style.
-Lack of variety with the clothes you could wear. Almost everything you could wear from crafted clothes look the same or out right bad.
-Lack of materials that can be crafted. Materials from some aragami and minor aragamis can no longer be crafted through the crafting section. You're now mostly forced to farm them from missions.
-Almost everyone from the old cast can't be seen in this game. They just tease you with mentioning them either from the story or random conversations with the NPCs.

Overall, I give this game a solid 9/10. I've got some complains here and there but that's a part of what really distinguishes it from the previous two games. Unlike God Eater 2 which almost had the same mechanics as God Eater Resurrection, God Eater 3 has it's own charm for being very different from the previous two entries. Hopefully, the next game comes out sooner because I want more from the story.",1603955140,1603976826,True,10,0,0.652868270874023438,0,True,False,False

    [*]Character customisation is expansive in outfits available/unlocked by the player; personalization such as face/body options are more limited
    [*]All types of God Arcs (weapons) are viable from early to endgame, you can even further customise towards your playstyle/build by choosing your favourite burst arts + effects & create custom bullets
    [*]Learning aragami attacks and weaknesses will enable you to earn higher ranks; exposing enemy weaknesses as well as learning higher ranks will earn you more rewards
    [*]Options such as acceleration triggers, engage effects, burst control units etc. are fun to play around with and experiment with to create OP builds

Besides this some other notes is that even though the game gives you a lot of time for hunting you don't use all of it most of the time it averages to 5 mins - 10 mins per hunt depending on your weapon.

You can also set aside any thoughts of an ""open-ish"" world, as the game takes place entirely on 4 walled maps, (for 90 something missions, which are all the same). You have to pretend that the ""base"" area is actually travelling across a vast space, but you never see any of it. You're in the base, and poof, you're teleported to a map for 3 minutes of combat with numbers flying. 

You'll never die during this, as the game is far too easy as long as you keep your weapons upgraded. I have no idea why missions have a 40 minute limit, you'll be in and out in no time, then back to stand around your ""base"", talk to one or two people, then continue on with the inane story. 

If you talked. You're the silent protagonist, and all you have going for you is your looks and massive boobs, which is really what the game is about. Physics. Physics and the creepy, plot line McGuffin, with the worst voice acting in the history of video gaming. You'll want to stab a pencil in your ear after just a few lines of dialog.

SPOILER

You almost get a chance to kill XXXX at one point, because saving a friend is way more woke than saving the world (or is it emo, I forget), but it's not that easy, and you'll listen to it all the way through post game, which is... wait for it. More of the same.

Did I enjoy it? The boobs, yes. The combat, yes. The loadouts and builds, yes. But the rest is so phoned in.

Please bear in mind that I spend a lot of time crafting and trying out the new weapon types in the 3rd installment ([b]Biting Edge[/b] and [b]Heavy Moon[/b]). Otherwise I'm pretty sure you can rush and end the game pretty quickly around 15 - 30 hours of gameplay.

I would recommend buying this game if it is [b]on sale[/b]. If you enjoy playing games like Monster Hunter or if you enjoyed the previous installment then you are more likely to enjoy this game. However, similar to the MHW series when it first came out, there are not many Aragami (monsters) to fight with and you can reach the end game pretty quickly. I guess, if you don't enjoy fighting similar / recolored monster repetitively, I don't think this is the right game is for you.

Despite the shorter content compared to GERB2, I enjoyed this series a lot more than GERB2. Anyway here are my reasons:

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*] You don't need to play previous installment to understand the game
[*] In my opinion, the story is 'less cliché' and cheesy compared to the GER2B. As I never really immersed myself with the previous installment's story, I feel that the story is a lot shorter & simpler this time, which is a plus point for me. However, this also mean that it could be a minus point depending on your taste. 
[*] There are new types of Aragami, called 'Ashborn', which could perform a [b]devour attack[/b] and enter a new mode a.k.a [b]burst status[/b]
[*] The combat feels more fluid and of course better graphics.
[*] Japanese Dub is available.
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*] Poor running animation outside missions.
[*] What the duck is wrong with the duct tape fashion.
[*] Some Aragamis have a very small wind-up animation time before attacking. This is a downside for me as it feels a bit unpolished compared to MHW.
[*] As the story set in another continent, the game are missing a lot of earlier installment's characters and operators.
[/list]

[b]Extra:[/b]
[list]
[*] A bit background of the game, the previous title (GEB, GERB2) is set somewhere in Japan while the 3rd installment is set somewhere in Europe.
[*] Depending on your taste, God Eater's map is always small compared to MH
[*] Bullets are nerfed quite hard, as you can only carry X amount of your custom bullet. In other words, if you previously enjoyed spamming OP bullets in GERB2 you might not enjoy the bullet system in this game.
[*] Similar to the previous series, the game might feel a bit too easy. However, you could always play the mission solo, without bringing the AI.
[*] Abandoned God arc max level is now capped at 5.
[*] Only one recurring character from the previous series.
[*] My favourite aragami (Susano'o) and operator (Hibari) are not in the game :(

The character creator is nice, and I enjoyed some of the characters that join your party. Hugo, Claire, Lulu, and Zeke were all interesting to interact with. The combat is also pretty engaging for the first four hours. It was also fun to see all of the different kinds of Aragami. Additionally, I enjoyed the story, it remains interesting from start to near the end. The weapon designs are neat, there are a lot of outfits, components for crafting aren't that difficult to get, and most of the character designs for the NPCs are pretty cool.

Now for the cons. The combat gets VERY repetitive, especially as the game seemingly becomes VERY obstinate in introducing new Aragami, or even connecting the combat with the plot at all. At one point, enemy organizations are following and attacking your character's party, AND INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THEM, YOU CONTINUE FIGHTING RE-USED ARAGAMI. I was already tired of the same fights over and over, but when the fight had nothing to do with the plot, I realized everything I was doing didn't matter. This means that the gameplay became a downside to the game I was playing. 

In addition, a character is introduced as a mcguffin, and they deus ex machina the ending, which felt extremely lazy. To top this off, the person who wanted to enslave and slaughter thousands of AGEs and who was also AT LEAST partly responsible for the forceful dehumanization of every AGE, not only is portrayed as having made a difficult decision that had to be done, but is also portrayed as not being a villain AND never gets ANY comeuppance whatsoever. That psychopath should have been the final battle, and they just ignore the problem entirely.

Overall, I give the game a 5/10. Too repetitive to be worth purchasing, even on discount, pretty forgettable, gameplay gets stale pretty fast and has no connection to the plot, and a plot that falls flat on its face near the end.",1595038562,1595038562,False,1,1,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

It runs off the system of ""here's a monster, kill it to make gear so you can fight stronger monsters. An easy comparison is that God Eater is the Street Fighter to Monster Hunters Soul Calibur. 

GE is more combat pre planning and perfect execution of moves during the fight. You rely on a lot of the same string of quick attacks to deal a lot of strong damage in as quick of a time as possible. MH rely on inventory planning and adaptation during a fight, being able to juggle between attack and defense more methodically.

A quick and dirty game play loop for GE is something like: devour, special move, special move, dodge, devour, special move, special move, dodge, heal, devour, special move, etc.
The loop for MH is more something like :attack, attack, store energy, dodge, attack, attack, special attack, store special energy, dodge, spend big energy on even specialer attack, repeat.

MH has more of a long build up to reach bigger numbers while GE lets you dive into your special moves right away. 
MH takes an average person more than 10-5 minutes to finish an average fight while in GE you can down a monster in about 2 minutes if you just go all out attack spam and just let your healer do their job.

The point is while GE has fun game play, it's still a very ""empty"" game. There's no reason to like the generic anime characters. There's no reason to enjoy the world and its environment. There's no reason to care about the monsters you're fighting. There's no reason to care about mastering weapons cause they all feel straight forward and easy to master if you spend a day or two just using it and experimenting. 

If you want a more meaningful hunting game that puts emphasis on the world and design, play Monster Hunter.

If you want an anime hunting game where you can just quickly jump in and smash on a monster you don't really care about, play God Eater.


One last thing, this game has NO I-frames. Your only options of avoiding damage is to stand in place and block like a damn muppet, or run away like some coward. This game is seriously missing out on the satisfaction factor of I-frame dodging, which I personally think will will improve the game greatly, both in mechanics and high risk high reward reinforcement. Now I do know about the trigger that let's you gain I-frames from dodging but only after you meet certain combat requirements. This in itself is very lack luster as these buffs last only a few seconds so you're constantly having to juggle multiple buff systems for an opportunity. The whole high risk high reward concept can be used in this scenario but for a very limited time during a fight. I'm at a decent point where I can beat most Aragami within 5 minutes or less, but during those 5 minutes I'm usually cursing and complaining about cheap hits I take or just buffs or abilities running out JUST when I was ready to utilize it. Going back to Monster Hunter real quick, a lot of late game monsters can take anywhere from 5-20 minutes to beat depending on what goes on but I find more enjoyability in a long, satisfying fight when the odds are a bit more fair but tough. This includes adjustments for: hit boxes, timing, AI coordination, map layout, monster attack designs. Those are the strong points that need to be balanced out a bit more before this game reaches its full potential.

I enjoy this game, I just can't recommend it for people who aren't familiar with beat-em-ups or hunt style games. Specially with no I-frames..",1594661868,1594853122,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
899440,72636190,76561198216831283,0,4,7118,0,6972,1703068414,"I love God Eater, and not because it is ""an anime Monster Hunter"". If it was just a MonHun game but in the skin of ""anime"", I would have probably dropped God Eater Burst back in 2011 just like how I dropped PSP MH2 back in 2009. I own MHWI right now, it's pretty good and fixed most of my issues with how it presents itself to the player compared to MH2, still not a game I would say ""I love"", but I will say that I like it.

GE3 (and by extension, the other mainline GE games) are more akin to 3D platformers like ""Crash Bandicoot"" series and ""Rachet and Clank"" for me, with most of your attacks, abilities, and mobility placed on the default state of the player avatar. MonHun has no jumping (you can *YEET* yourself off of a ledge though, but I didn't know that as a kid) and requires you to balance the sheathed and unsheathed weapon state of the player, something I was not used to as a kid who mostly played platformers.

The tutorials of GE3 are much simpler and more focused on getting a player to learn what the f*ck to do against tiny mobs. You can also play the tutorials again to be able to get some repeated training with a system that teaches you the controls in organized steps. While MHW managed to change a lot of how it did the tutorials compared to MH2 and it does so in a way that I actually learned something, putting me into a live fight with monsters that can kill me when I am a f*cking noob and the only thing telling me what to do are button prompts that are on the screen, all while I am busy screaming because I am about to get crushed by an Anjanath kinda puts into context why I even point out the differences of the tutorials. Am I supposed to ""git gud""? Yeah, I sure as hell am supposed to, but I ain't someone who spent a great amount of time playing harder games as a kid when I had to be busy getting that Asian A+ in class. Baby steps are still a thing.

Being closer to a 3D platformer, as I had said previously, there is a lot more access to speed and verticality in GE3. Not only is the better access to verticality a form of movement, I think it is important to see it as a defensive option during a fight, besides the usual dodging on the ground and the ability to block. It is harder to reposition in MonHun, mainly due to how slow you are, and yep, you can't jump.

The story of GE3 is cheaply written, but it isn't outright bad. Just mostly tropey stuff that isn't as exciting anymore. But at least there is a plot, not much I can say for MHW in that regard...

The battle system in GE3 is simpler. Some people might call it shallow, but I think that's only in comparison to games that gave them a challenge. I've played games with large multi-part systems that are honestly garbage and force you to optimize the fun out of a game because there is no point in exploring the ""full potential"" of the system. Simpler doesn't immediately mean shallow, imo, but it does mean that there is, well, less complexity (duh).

The gameplay is much faster in GE3 compared to its prequels, and while the game lacks the difficult content that a bunch of GE veterans are currently asking for (stuff that was in GER and GE2RB), trying to play GE as if you are playing MonHun is asking yourself to get knocked out. Embrace the speed. Embrace the verticality. Embrace the fact that dodging has no invulnerability frames and you need to block in some occasions. Embrace the lack of a whetstone and sharpening system. Embrace that fact that you have to take a bite out of your target (hence God Eater) in order to gain buffs and slap the shit out of the Aragami (kinda like the Insect Glaive, but the Insect Glaive was made years after GE first came out, lmao). Embrace the Dive system and shield bash through your enemies' attack so that you may make ""oho, so you're approaching me me"" Jojo memes. Embrace the fact that it isn't at all a 1-to-1 copy of MonHun.

Conclusion (?):
To call GE3 an ""anime Monster Hunter"" kinda does injustice to what GE3 has tried to do, which was make a simpler but faster ""giant creature slaying"" game. But that same ""anime Monster Hunter"" also does an injustice to the amount of work Capcom has done into making their Monster Hunter series the game it is, which is a slower and more methodical approach to killing something larger than the player.",1594668273,1594668273,True,4,0,0.534608364105224609,0,True,False,False

Edit: I'm adjusting the list because I've played a whole lot more of this game now and there are things that need updating.

* This game was made with the PS4 in mind. Abandon all hope, potatoes who enter here.

* To my fellow Blast Gunners: They took out the Blast Guns and replaced them with the Ray Guns. It is a tragedy, but I understand why they did it: They also took out friendly fire, the one thing limiting Blast Guns' destructive potential.

* The story has been criticized for being short. It is definitely short compared to the first two games, but one would do well to remember that every time they remade the first two games they added even more story. GE3 has never had a remake, so of course the story is comparatively short.

* The characters are great. Some of the English voice acting feels a little choppy at times (sorry, Claire), but the characters are definitely fun.

* Phym gets her own bullet point. She's a little Aragami girl not unlike Shio from the first game that imprints on the main character. Imprints is definitely the right word because she follows you around the main base like a duckling. She is too cute for human words other than ""bean"" and I can't deal.

* Weapon skills are handled very differently from the first two games. They only go up to level five, though some can stack to level 10. There also don't appear to be any weapon skills that are two or more in one slot. These two factors greatly limit the potential for customization. I also haven't been able to find any rank 5 Stamina skills and I think I've maybe found 1 rank 5 Health. Edit: I've now found enough Rank 5 Staminas and Healths to max out those stats on my normal loadout. It took too long, but I done dids it.

* Edit: This paragraph used to be me talking about how I haven't tried out the new melee weapons yet. I still haven't done much with the Biting Edge (the twin swords), but the Heavy Moon is pretty fun.

* The new Ashborn Aragami are terrifying. Like, my goodness. If they hit you with Devour, if you get downed *your allies can't revive you.* Running like hell only sometimes works depending on the Aragami you're trying to run from and the map you're running in. Edit: Perfect Guarding will stop a Devour Attack in its tracks, and is more efficient than running, so I've been trying to get good at it. It's not easy, but it does work. Just make sure you don't for any reason lose sight of the Aragami in question.

* People have said that this game isn't a great sequel to the first two. I can see what they mean. The setting is an entire continent away, and only one character from the first two actually shows up in the third (though there's a second who makes a cameo and two more mentioned by name).

* Edit: Here's a new paragraph. I just wanted to mention that they did a fantastic job with the one character that got carried over from the first two games. They did an amazing job with him.

Overall, probably get this on Playstation unless your computer is pretty decent. There are definitely things in it that are better if you're familiar with the first two, but they're not only few and far between but subtle enough that you wouldn't even know you're missing a reference. Edit: For the most part. There are a lot more fun references in the post-postgame that will go over the heads of anyone unfamiliar with the first two games.",1593285793,1594407373,True,52,2,0.794428706169128418,0,True,False,False

The story and characters seem interesting but the game structure is lacking:
The game is segmented into missions and each mission takes approximately 2-4min. to complete. After every mission you have to spend another 5-10min. in the hub chatting with the NPCs in order to progress the story. The hub itself is unnecessarily segmented into 3 floors and 5 rooms separated by loading screens (1-2 seconds of loading) each. 
When you are actually on a mission, the combat is bland, easy and repetitive. I was easily getting SS or SSS grades. 
In conclusion, you spend more time traversing the hub and speaking with NPCs than actually playing the game.

After spending a few hundred hours in MHW and a thousand hours in  PSO2 JP server, the combat in this game felt unsatisfying. Hitting aragamis felt boring. It's like your character's just hitting air. The attack anticipation of aragamis are sometimes only a split second which causes you to unable to block in time because you're already committed to a combo that you can't cancel. Due to this, it forces you to play ""slowly"" in a ""fast-action"" game. Sometimes, I catch myself mindlessly spam attacks and just not bother to block at all because of how quick or unnoticeable the aragami attack anticipations are. 

The story? It's a God Eater game so don't expect much.

The OST? It's good but the previous games' had better memorable OST. (The teen in me can't stop listening to ""No Way Back"" and ""An Approaching Nightmare"".)

Also the Ash Aragami designs are good. I like these new creepy aragami designs but nothing beats the creepiness of Prithvi Mata.

Basically my problems are the ""weight"" of attack animations and the quick,sometimes unnoticeable, attack anticipations of aragamis that makes the game ""artificially"" hard. Yes, I know the previous 2 games were like this too but after playing other similar hunting games, I realized how it makes difficultness of the game felt cheap .

Buy it full price - Good
Buy it on sale - much better value since they decided to update FREE dlc patches into the game.
Pirate? - No, please support the devs! >:(

Note: I'm not hating on the GE series, I just want it to improve because it's one of my favorite games when I was a teen.

The thing that draws me apart from the obvious monster hunting was the stories from the first game (the second one was a total trash, sorry for the brutality). In the recent years, Bandai Namco has not produce worthwhile stories in other games but God Eater 3 has some solid stories that I feel that I can keep coming back to. It's not their best but still decent enough for the department to be on the right track.

But this is a game, not a storybook, so I'll just summarize the pros and cons of this game. Like I was gushing earlier, the story is solid. Gameplay-wise, older player of God Eater will be familiar with the controls, objectives and the basics of the game. At the same time, it is actually pretty easy for the beginners to jump in and play. Some people said that the gameplay is repetitive but that's actually the same for every other monster hunting games. I like the tutorial missions but I do feel sometimes that if I want to restart with a new character, I have the option to skip that part (I still have not replayed same characters in New Game plus, so I don't really know if skipping tutorials is an option there). Still, they are not overly long to the point of annoyance or else people are going to make memes out of it.

Graphics with Unreal Engine 4 are usually nice and this game is not the exception, which is a good thing. The music scores are decent but they are not something you want to hear on IPods or Spotify over and over again (I'm probably wrong. To each their own taste). The characters were written solidly, so kudos for that. The characters' designs are good, though I'm not crazy with some of the clothes for the protagonist(s) and main characters. Love the missions, they are of decent challenges and contribute a lot of points to the replayability of the game. There were few bugs here and there but not something that breaks the game. Haven't tried multiplayer yet except for big monsters' missions (which I'll refrain from uttering the proper name because I hate spoilers), even then I rarely find actual players to play with. Of course, that could also mean my network sucks and the bots for those missions aren't too shabby actually.

My personal opinion, if you like playing monster hunting game, you'll probably going to like playing this game too. I'd say the price is right for the content it brings to the table.",1593533201,1593533714,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Noticeably there's not that many different arenas to fight in and the bosses can feel a bit repetitive, but I found it easy to overlook due to finding different tactics to take down each boss. 
Like previously mentioned, I loved all the characters and usually in the games I play I usually just have a set team. But I constantly kept finding myself swapping around my squad when doing different missions, which really payed off due to some characters being essential for specific missions. 
Leveling them all and upgrading all my weapons also felt very rewarding, and completing all the additional missions didn't feel like a chore.

It's a story driven game, but it does still require a little bit of grinding for particularly rare materials needed to upgrade your equipment.   You have the option to play with others as well to help you out a little more reliably than an AI might, however due to the password system many are restricting themselves to only doing events with their friends.

Now, here are some pros and cons I feel are needed to be said, these of course are in my opinion by personal experiences I've had and others may not agree with what I found to be positive and what I found negative.



Pros.
High customization.  From your weapons, to your character's outfit and to what skills your weapons might have set.

Multi option for AI unit set ups.   By playing with your AI allies you gain points that can be spent to boost them with up to 4 abilities, from slowly regaining their HP, to changing how they act while in battle.

A beautiful yet haunting image of a world torn by the ""Ash"".  Each mission show cases locations across the ashlands (amidst a small stage number) with amazing visuals.

Many approaches for how to deal with each enemy.    From attacking at a distance, to using traps to debilitate, you can even set down traps and mines along the paths that an enemy might take for an early edge.

Cons.
Password system locks many people from interacting with others. 
Due to preference for playing with friends, this makes it harder to collect the helpful ""Engage"" abilities as they are gained from interacting with players who own them in the team/assault missions.

Rare drops can cause multiple attempts at the same mission with chance of no pay-off.
There is a lack of a list for where materials are gained unless looking at the mission selection screen, often requiring the player to write down what material they gained in what mission for ease of access so they will not need to scan each mission's reward listing.


""Link Aid"" priority.   
The AI will try to help revive you if you get knocked out, but sadly the enemy can stand right on top of you, during this sort of moment the ally that was chosen to come to your rescue will usually begin to spam dodge until the monster has gotten off what is most likely your now cold corpse.

All in all I'd say that God Eater 3 is a very enjoyable and fun experience, it has some issues here and there but I've enjoyed it every step of the way even with those in mind. 
For those who are hesitant you could try getting the game during a sale, though personally, I feel like full price is worth it as well.

-AI can sometimes ignore what you're doing and go off to do their own thing if there's more than 1 medium/large Aragami, leaving you to fight a particularly troublesome aragami by yourself while the rest of the team decide against it. There might have been a way to control what they target, but if there is, it wasn't properly explained, and I was left feeling extremely frustrated. Or i'm an idiot. Both are valid answers.

- Particularly large Aragami can appear honestly massive in cutscenes, but once you get into battle they tend to look like they got cut down in size. Most likely to make them easier to fight, but honestly, it's a slight let down.

-Material names don't give a hint as to who/where they come from. Sometimes it's easy to figure out based on the weapon's design. If it looks like this aragami, then the parts must come from it. But otherwise it doesn't tell you right up front where you can get it, which can make getting certain weapons too much of a hassle to get.

That being said I still can recommend this game whole heartedly, the combat is really fun and while I only seriously choose one weapon type the vast majority of the game (Heavy Moon, along with a sniper and medium shield) all God Arcs looks really interesting and fun to play with.",1592921796,1592921796,True,1,0,0.515151500701904297,0,True,False,False

Felt like it had less content compared to GE 2 RB (Like missing a lot of variants, all of the deusphage monsters. Along with urobobo and adra among others, but well, this version didn't have the 'RB' part )

One of the reasons i think that happened is because in difference with the two older games the models seemed to be higher poli, so i guess they had to redo the Aragamis rather than stuffing em into the game (Like from one to two?).



Now they said this won't be getting the RB version, so i guess it's on to GE4 as they apparently released the last update some time ago. Hopefully they won't have to 're-update' the models there. That will let them move the content from 3 to 4 rather than remaking it (If that's what happened this time around).



None the less, it was fun while it lasted. Now time to wait for GE4...and i better see Alice this time around.

Ohh and speaking of Alice, this one had considerably less npc's to take with you into battle (Again probably because of the updated models)...but...who am i kidding, all i wanted was Alice xD

Obviously the game is very very anime, and is similar in concept, but not execution, to monster hunter. It is much much smaller maps and quicker fights in this game with a focus on progression and storyline rather than singular extended fights to gather materials for crafting from a specific high tier monster. This game is structured more like a tiered list where monsters lock you out of the next tier until you beat the previous enough to craft the next version of your preferred weapon. All weapons follow the same tiers, with similar looks and damage outputs. The intricacy is from all of your movesets which unlock the more you use them, and item slots and team combos and this boost and that form and you get the idea. Not a skill tree in the common sense, but a skill tree nonetheless.

Kind of like monster hunter world but it's not open world, the levels relatively small arenas with a handfull of enemies. There are 8 base weapons with multiple upgrade models, all balanced (unlike MHW) and some of them are trick weapons that have alternate modes (eg. the twin daggers turn into a double ended spear). There are three attacks, heavy, light and devour: You can charge your attacks for more damage with the cost of standing still like a mong, devouring your enemy increases your damage and charges your ai teammates special abilities, you can do air attacks, shield bashes and you have a ranged weapon you can switch to if you want but it's very limited with ammo. 

Missions are short, bosses aren't very challenging.
UI is pretty clean.
Weapons feel good.
Music is rad.
Customisation isn't overly extensive but it does more than it needs to.
Enemy design is pretty sick.

I wish you didn't need to go to the terminal to change equipment, do your allies skill points, save and just do it in the start menu.

Sure the game doesn't come close having graphics as good as Monster Hunter World, however the fast paced action combat is on a totally different scale compared to Monster Hunter World. Right off the bat you are introduced to the game's core combat mechanics with the tutorial(I disabled it after the first quest) but which is all unnecessary since everything is easily picked up upon by just testing combos by pressing X(light attack) and Y(heavy attack) on ground and in mid air. God Eater 3 also offers you the option to have roles of Attacking, Defending, and Healing more so than what Monster Hunter World can offer in terms of playstyle.

In my opinion as far as character builds and play style go, God Eater 3 is by far more diverse and more complicated over the gear and gem system in Monster Hunter World due to the fact there is something called the Burst Art and Burst Art Effect system(weapon skills along with additional secondary weapon skill effects which changes the play style of each weapon despite the fact 2 players might be using the same exact weapon). As for gearing options every player has the option of equipping one of 8 types melee weapons, one of 3 types of shields, and one of 4 types of ranged weapons at the same time allowing every player to be able to have close combat or ranged combat options at the same time. Armor however isn't a factor at all in God Eater compared to Monster Hunter World, in God Eater 3 our armor are costumes and purely for aesthetics only.

This game alone is a 5/5 for me but when compared to Monster Hunter World, in terms of graphics God Eater 3 is a 3/5(Monster Hunter World has more realistic textures).
In terms of combat I would give God Eater 3 a 5/5 vs Monster Hunter World's 4/5(Monster Hunter World doesn't offer fast paced dashing for every weapon making transitioning from place to place very slow in comparison to God Eater 3).
In terms of gameplay I would put God Eater 3 above Monster Hunter World which has been explained as to why already.

God Eater 3 is a solid recommendation from me especially with the on going sale right now at the time of this review($24). Tons of content in game without additional purchases of DLC.",1589345275,1589362834,True,2,0,0.523622035980224609,0,True,False,False

It runs well and is very well optimized, the Japanese voice acting is good, and the story is mediocre but at least it's well animated and keeps me more interested than the Monster Hunter World story, which was just cringe to watch through (and you couldn't even skip the cutscenes).

It is more polished and prettier than its predecessors but don't expect too much from graphics or presentation. It is no Monster Hunter World even if people keep comparing them. 

It won't stress a mid-tier system even when turned to max but I have had some technical issues where it fails to exit properly and locks up my GPU (can't start another 3d game, can't shut down). Might be video-driver related but not had this with other games. 

The plot is still 'safe'. The mission hub is still a bit too spread out so it gets annoying hunting down the NPCs to chat to. The menus are still a chore to navigate. They work but clearly the devs decided to just leave them alone rather than try improve on them. Character designs are OK but way too much duct tape. The lack of a male/female MC opening made me a little sad; it was a nice touch in prior games but I guess it isn't very cost-effective. 

I purchased this very late after it first released, so it has had a lot of updates. The devs have provided a lot of these and new content over the past 2 years.

Story is a little mushy for my personal preferances and I guess it'll stay that way but it's surprisingly good and interesting for this kind of game. I'm definately more and more intrigued!

Weapons, Monsters and Characters are very detailed! Environment could use a little bit of work, as far as graphics goes in comparison to the rest of it, but since you'll hardly pay a lot of attention to aestethics while in combat I'm willing to let that one slide personally. 

Gameplay is awesome and very smooth. I'm playing on keyboard + mouse. Haven't tried the Gamepad yet and don't even have the urge to do so. It's surprisingly easy to play it on keyboard and mouse. Interface is clean, commands and combos are easy enough to learn and keep in mind. Nothing to overwhelming or hard to remember. Camera sensitivity is even after adjustment slightly too fast but I'd say nothing you couldn't get used to it after a little bit of playtime and practice. 

I'm not in endgame yet and don't know how far I still have to play the story to even get there so I shell revisit a few parts of this review as soon as I'm done. But I guess like many games in this genre it'll get a little more complex when it comes to weapons and their components, or when it comes to your Loadout options and its adjustments and what not. 
Also as these kind of games are it's a little bit grindy, or maybe a lot grindy in the endgame, but I think everyone knows this beforehand and would not play it if they're not into grind and a little bit of timesink.

I don't really like compairing games to one another but I'd say I'd recommend it to anyone who liked MHW and other action based games where you engage epic combat against huge monsters with even bigger weapons in your hands. Even if not, I'd still recommend it for the story, which, in my opinion, is worth the playtime on its own.

Compared to the obvious alternative monster hunter, most of the aragamis simply spam their attacks without any hint of what may come. In monster hunter, after learning the movements and actions of a given monster, you can fight it without getting hit once. You can estimate what action lead to which attack and react. And thats the point. REACT. You react to what is comming next because you can read the monster. Nearly all attacks (or at least those which matter by dealing massive damage or inficting status) can be foreseen.

In God Eater, aragamis transition from neutral stance to devastating attacks with little to no time in between. This has nothing to do with ""gid gud"" IMHO, because there isnt simply any animation at all to see an attack coming.

This point alone is the reason for me to uninstall the game and never return.

I expected a game that allows me to learn enemies, to learn to read them after some icebreaking, and then to defeat them in a ""fancy"" way by avoiding their attacks and devastate them in between.

Not great, not terrible, just so-so. I was hoping the first PC/console God Eater would be a huge step up over the last two ports of PSP/Vita games, but I can't really say it is. Recommended for huge fans of the series, but I had a lot more fun with Burst, Resurrection, and Rage Burst.

Pros:
+The basic combat has been refined a little. God Arc swings feel weightier now, and connecting with an attack feels more satisfying than ever. The Dive action lets you fling yourself around the stage at high speed, and it's super fun.
+The new God Arc types are interesting.
+Most of the new Aragami types are fun and interesting to fight, especially the Ashborn.
+Most of the characters are likable. Phym is adorable, and I liked Ricardo, especially after his Traversing the Past missions. I'd probably go gay for Hugo.

Cons:
-The bullet editor has been gimped. In the first two games, your custom bullets consume OP, so even if they're overpowered OP guzzlers, you can always replenish your OP and keep using them. In GE3, your custom bullets have point values, and you can take a total of 1500 points of custom bullets with you on a mission. Say you make a custom bullet that uses 150 points. You can only use 10 of them per mission, and there's no way to refill them once they're out. I guess this was done to prevent people from nuking a stage in 20 seconds with the Gate of Babylon, but it makes the bullet editor feel unrewarding.
-The game is insultingly easy.
-The crafting system is annoyingly limited. Previous games allowed you to craft low-level area materials and Aragami materials, but GE3 only allows you to craft a small number of them. This means that if you want to craft a variety of God Arcs, you'll be grinding Level 1 and 2 missions for low-level area materials instead of just going into the console to craft them from higher-level materials. This isn't fun, it's just tedious.
-The Traversing the Past missions are tedious. If they're supposed to be GE3's equivalent of the Burst or Rage Burst expansions over the base game, I kind of want half my money back. You dive into a character's subconscious and learn about their past, then fight a few low-level monsters that offer zero challenge or reward. Over and over again. At least five times for each character. The backstories themselves are fine. A few of them are actually pretty good. The way the game chooses to deliver them is awful.",1586104593,1586104593,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There were no new particularly engaging gameplay added over what Resurrection or Rage Burst had to offer.
The Burst Arts are far tamer than the Blood Arts GE2, as most of the arts here are merely same combos with higher damage outputs, or slightly altered visual effects, but there's nothing about them that makes them unique over eachother.
The engage effect may as well not have been present at all, and was pretty visibly added as a gameplay mechanic entirely because of being a deus ex machina for the story.
Acceleration Triggers was similarly only added on account of attempting to tie in story elements to gameplay, in a way that falls entirely flat.
As for the story, it's okay at best; I can see what they were going for and the characters are mostly likeable, but the pacing is really, really bad, and they blatantly fail to connect what you do in missions to have any relevance with the story itself.
The cutscene direction feels very misguided; it focuses on the wrong parts a lot, and overemphasizes on close-ups in moments where the bigger picture would have had more of an impact.

That said, the game did make me feel pride of parenthood, even if the way they write characters makes feel like the writers have no idea how children act or behave. But when you're revving up a chainsaw axe next to a little gremlin that does the exact same, you can't help but feel a little bit of pride swelling (even if the occurrence is just chance).

However overall, I cannot recommend this game over the other games in the God Eater series. Storywise it felt like a blend of the first and the second game, and both of them execute their parts in a much more impactful way than what they ended up doing with this one, and this similarly applies to the gameplay mechanics. It just feels like they have a lot of groundwork that could have resulted in something a lot better.

Be it in form of time missions, challenges or a bit of story. But it felt at some point devs gave up and just copy pasta (I cant help it, that's how I feel about the traversing past). We got more tape-less clothes, weapons, upgrades. 

Overall we became even more OP than we used to be so adding some sort of ""challenge"" missions was really on spot. Honestly the most game breaking is the dive itself. Not only making step canceling obsolete and useless (apart from looking neat while doing it) but also aragami are unable to escape us as we can easily keep up with them or even worse out run them. 

The ultimately worst thing I will probably never get over. MUSIC. I know beating No Way Back experience while you fight Dyaus Pita for the first time is hard to do (bonus points if you are one of those who faced it on psp/emu where it was real pain as we did basically no more than a slight tickle-tickle damage compared to now). But even the less ""impactful"" osts left something behind them. Like if you played previous games and will google ""Shadows Over the City"" you will immidietly remember the map, probably how you often got frustrated by cathedral (I mean when it was not having that huge hole so you had to walk around). Also the landscape and maybe where most of shiny loot was. But here? I cant remember which map has which ost. The only one i remember is Nemesis which should be equivalent to NWB.

I remember how at some point i turned of music and just listened GER/RB on yt.

[b] Heals [/b]: imagine you put down the green ball and aragami decided to hop at you... the ball is gone, well HERE MY BALL GETS UNTOUCHED FINALLY! <just a fun fact
[b] God Arcs [/b]: well, for someone like me who's literally living in my own world where I'm an melee old type so I don't know much about guns (other than no more broken blood bullets to break the gravity laws) I really do like how some melee weapons got buffed or changed. Short sword made me even more flying and kiss Quadriga on its forehead (you can get so high with one burst art+dash) meanwhile long sword became double edged blade with its counter BA (note: maybe I should have go for tower shield for that one, hehe) and there's many more

The gameplay consists of timed missions in a fairly small environment, usually with one ""big"" enemy and sometimes a few small ones as well.
The base moveset of each weapon is fairly distinct and you can enhance one attack per category (ground, air and step) with different stronger variants as well as a modifier.
You can't really take many hits so learning to either evade or block is important.

Overall it's a pretty competent action RPG, not really competing for the ""best game ever"" but definitely good enough to spend a hundred hours or two for those that enjoy this kind of games.",1585345047,1585345047,True,6,1,0.58841472864151001,0,True,False,False

With the supposed final update released today, I feel like now is a good time to review it.

Let's first talk about the elephant in the room, I like the game. Fans, “probably” will like the game. However, for a newcomer, I would not recommend this game. If you’re a fan of the series, you clearly don’t need this review. It’s more of the same shit you got from Resurrection. If you liked Rage Burst more, you may not like this game as much.

Now onward to the review for people who might but this game on a sale.
I’ll answer the obvious. God Eater 3 is so detached from the core series that Marvelous should have just name this God Eater: Europe. So no, [i]you[/i], the potential buyer don’t need to play Resurrection and Rage Burst first (although I’d recommend it) in order to enjoy this game. I won’t spoil much of the plot, but supposedly the final update added more lore to the game which has a bunch of references to the core series. However I haven’t played the final update as I can’t really motivate myself to play it even in this “lockdown”. I won't comment on the overall plot cause I'm a sucker for trash stories (I liked the Resident Evil Movies, sue me).

Next I bet you’re wondering about the gameplay. It’s a standard hack and slash game with a stamina bar. Every action besides walking consumes stamina. You take missions, go out to the field, kill, collect and repeat. The enemies in game are varied just enough that the rehashed enemies aren’t mind numbingly boring. But there are almost 2-3 types of each enemies that are just recolored or upgraded versions of themselves. So if you hate killing red slimes in area A only to kill blue slimes in area B, you probably would get sick of this game. But the plus side of this, the enemy patterns are the same so you'll be able to kill and collect faster. Which in turn allows you to upgrade your weapon, and, you guessed it, kill and collect faster.

Duct tape. I hope you love duct tape. You see anime games tend to be notorious with character customization *cough* [strike]code vein[/strike] *cough*. However in this game almost all default outfits are littered with duct tape. Sure it fits the theme of the game (plot), and they did try to rectify this by adding duct tapeless outfits in the updates, but it wasn’t the same as the older games. Next we can talk about the weapon customization, or there lack of. Sure you can choose the weapon of choice, hammer, dual daggers, scythe, etc. However I'm talking about the diversity within the weapon class. You can use the standard beginner’s blade and upgrade that until you get the end game weapon with Pulse. Sure you [i]can[/i] kill things faster with a weapon that has an elemental type strong against the enemy, but you'd need to make four for each type. It's much easier to invest in a non-elemental one as you'd only need to farm one set.

Multiplayer? [i]Hahaha[/i]. I hope you’re buying this game with friends.

Overall, game’s pretty good. But if I were to remove my “fanboy filters” all I can see is a short game using better graphics with the name God Eater attached to it. Buy it on a sale if you’re interested, but you could honestly get more enjoyment from the other game.",1585279280,1585279280,False,212,24,0.732385635375976563,0,True,False,False

I'll keep it short:

+Graphics are great on PC. (60fps, No ultra-wide support, tho)
+The story and characters have far exceeded my expectations. There wasn't really any character that I thought was lacking.
+Gameplay feels very fluid and it feels a lot more honest when you're in combat. (idk if that makes sense, but that's just how I feel)
+The music: At first I was hoping for more of the style of the previous titles, but then these ones grew on me and they are GREAT.

-More story and end-game content pls (glad there'll be some free DLC offered, though!)
-Maybe I'm asking for too much, but I was hoping to see more maps and perhaps revisit some of the older maps from the previous games.

Side-note: You don't really have to play previous titles to understand the story. Maybe a few bits are referenced, but it's not enough to make you feel completely lost. It stands very strong on its own.

I'd give this... 8/10

Previous game knowledge not necessary, GE3 is effectively a reboot of the franchise though returnees will recognise a certain face, albeit a few decades older and minus an edgy permanent hood.

Monster Hunter with 200% more weeb and 10000% more flex tape. That shit is *everywhere*. Don't buy if you like staring at your char's ass and don't appreciate grunge outfits. Gameplay is Monster Hunter style but less focus on open gathering and more focus on action. RNG on monster drops are equally cancer. Difficulty's lower than Monster Hunter and somewhere between the two earlier PC ports of this franchise. One step forward, half a step back (or more) sums it up. Gameplay is solid and improved but things like the NPC character story arcs and customizability of both the God Arcs and outfits suffered tremendously. As with previous games, initial release only has 7 chapters with more to come as patches and stuff are released. They did somehow roughly cram 2 arcs (3 if counting the tutorial I guess) into an overarching arc in those 7 chapters though - and managed not to make it feel rushed. No more fluff missions between story progression either, every mission progresses further with cutscenes. None of that DO TEN MISSIONS BEFORE THE NEXT STORY CUTSCENE this time around. Being a multi release instead of a port this time, they also don't have the stupidity AI bug caused by framelocked coding (y'know, couldn't charged devour, block, buster charge, etc properly if at all...) from the earlier PC ports. They're back to being useful!

Overall? Buy if you want Monster Hunter Lite™ with more focus on action and less on gathering.

2.3 patch block edit: It seems Ban/co is switching from the old 'story arc' patch format. Each patch has been releasing what is effectively character arcs (Clair > Hugo, Zeke > Lulu, Ricardo [no, not THAT Ricardo] > Phym) that put their past in a bit more perspective. Loosely comparable to the character arc system from the previous GE2RB. With each respective patch they also drop a variant of an existing aragami. They're a little more than a retexture, but they're not entirely new fights either. They just have some new tricks up their sleeve. It's like walking into GE:R after playing GE2RB. It's not Iceborne, but at least they haven't TOTALLY abandoned this for Code:Vein. Probably. *nervous chuckle*",1568949388,1580899219,True,27,6,0.701040148735046387,0,True,False,False

The battle mechanic, which is the main selling point on GE series, got perfected so much that GE3 feels more GE than its predecessors. Three more weapons, new systems, and battle that is way more fluid compared to before. And the result is you can actually miss-match everything to find almost a perfect match to your own playstyle. That mean hours and hours of fun trying unique mechanics provided by each and every weapons and skills.

Aragamis, items, weapons, skills, drops, and practically about everything else got better balanced. At least it feels that way. Because for me, the game is becoming a bit too easy to fully enjoy. Even the last boss is too easy to beat. With a certain weapons and skills, GE3 feels more like a hack and slash game rather than a hunting game.

Character creation doesn't improve much. But the upgraded visual is price enough for me. And after you beat the game for the first time, you are given a menu to change anything about your character, including gender. So all is good.

The story is, well, a bit disappointing. Small cast of bland characters, impactless story, and short campaign. It's like they pour money on gameplay then invest whatever left to the story. If it's a novel, it won't even warrant half a book. I don't even think the story will remain in my memory for a more than a month after I finish the game.

GE3 is a bit of a weird game... in that sense it thinks you've already played the previous games, as the tutorials are rather... barebones, and could've been counteracted by just using a Yes/No answer to the player if they're played the previous games, with ""Yes"" having a better explanation to the mechanics.

As I mentioned, GE3 is a bit of a weird game, it's not explicit about what God Arc items do, unless you take a bit of time and/or research to see how they work, and where you find the desired item drop place by searched for the mission board (Amy).

GE3 is balancing between great and bad in which I'll explain:

The greats are the gameplay, with the amount of unique attack moves you can do, how weapons work, special moves with different Burst Arts to them (further making special moves even more unique), to ranged weapons also being quite unique with their own unique moves (not as much as your ordinary melee weapons however). Shields are... 50/50, which I'll explain in the bad.
The sounds also great, but... the music in some places where the story takes place suddenly booms so you can barely listen to what characters will say, but overall serves fine. And the story is rather a ""hit or miss"", but I guess it's a bit of a miss from me, as I just found it suitable.

The bad: 
The gameplay (again yes), here the problem lies with the hurtboxes (enemy attacks) or the hitboxes (player character's boxes of receiving damage) are really weird, most of the times you'll get hit where it otherwise wouldn't have hit you, but at such a situation, they should've made another type of hurtbox where it instead hurts the player, knocks back, as I personally found some rather... bullshit moments. 
Farming, as usual in any game that requires you to grind... the RNG can be really wonky at times, as I had some times where a 25% item drop rate wouldn't drop before 7 to 8 runs were done, where I had several more items at 10% dropping more frequently, so expect some weird RNG.
Shields as I mentioned were 50/50... due to being either hindrance to you, unless you specifically train to block at correct times (will negate all damage and not consume stamina if I recall correctly), or you miss the block timer and receive some damage or ALL of the damage because the shield couldn't develop in time. As far as I could see, there aren't really reliable animation cancellation, thus making shields feel very heavy to deploy, but I guess that is up to training your shielding reflection.
The maps... there are A LOT of reused maps, but are at least in high quality compared to the previous titles.

Having completed all of what's currently in the game (1st of February 2020), the extra episodes which deepens some of the characters' stories were a needed touch for the game, in addition to ""Another Devil"" story part to add further difficulty by adding in some new enemies (reused assets, but with a bit more touch of attacks...). And there's more story seeing as it ends with a ""to be continued"", so we'll see in the future.

In conclusion: GE3 is great, with some bad to it, so take some grain of salt, does have a serviceable story (but no specific antagonist), has a variety of post-game content, and gets updated here and there from time to time with story, fixes and content. At a price, I'd recommend it at 30€ if you're a bit picky, or very discounted if you're very picky.
A conclusion edit: God Eater 3 got some desired updates to its characters and further adding some few more enemy bosses to spice things up, and will continue its story once again later (hopefully) and overall serves quite a good pick if you're bored or interested in the God Eater franchise. To end it with, once you've completed the base game (without the extra episodes) you can play on New Game+, so if you like that... go for it.",1580314805,1580559834,True,0,0,0.458567976951599121,0,True,False,False

The big improvements are the graphics, combat, aragami designs and environment details. The combat system (to me) is the highlight here, it's very fluid, customizable, exciting to watch and above all fun. The weapons all feel much better to use and the new additions (Biting Edge, Heavy Moon) promote different combat methods. The Variant Scythe is greatly improved to the point of being a little OP as well. 

The game is not without its flaws however, the story here is fairly bland and most of the characters are either forgettable or unlikeable. The only character I kind of like is Hugo... and that's it.

If a semi-open world was added to let you collect materials and hunt freely, this game could of potentially be a rival to Monster Hunter. However, it holds itself back by sticking to ""mission after mission"" formula. 

By all means this is a good game, the multiplayer is pretty entertaining and the assault missions can be hilarious with friends. The combat and weapon customization will most likely keep you interested as this is what this series is renowned for. If you like GOD EATER as a franchise you will probably like this!

Overall It's a 7/10

If I need to summarize it: It's Monster Hunter on steroid

It just feels good beating giant monsters with 3 other friends (or AI if you don't have friends). There's also the Assault Missions where you team up with other 7 players online (or AIs) to take down special monster in a limited time. Teamwork, DPS, and quick action are the key.

The story is decent 7/10, but the gameplay is awesome 9/10

Loot percentage is unforgiving, especially if you need to collect certain materials and it has like 10% of getting it, so you need to take the same missions over and over again, which can feel like a hassle. But getting the equipment you work hard for just feels great.

Very fast, very aggressive, fairly easy to learn. It is both solo and coop, you can make some pretty game breaking setups for your gear, but the sheer amount of spec setups and gimmicks, tidbits to add to your playstyle? Makes GE3 very personal preference friendly, something you don't see in a lot of other gear and spec building games. Sure, there are metaspecs and netlistard setups, but they aren't neccessary to be good at the game. Be warned, it is NOT a slow game, the combat is very fast, very twitch reflex. If you are good at Platinum games? You will find GE3 fairly easy. 
The basic gist of God Eater 3, is simple. Best Anime of 2019. Yes, it was released 2018, but its play year was 2019 and still ongoing. Its still pretty anime tropey, but no where near as bad as the earlier titles. The world of Northern Europe in the God Eater world, is pretty fantastic, they fleshed out a lot of the universe. Think an Anime, but where one of the main characters, is the persona you create for it. Supported by a pretty likable cast of characters. Just be warned, its fanservice heavy. Jiggle physics, sideboob, lots of leg, and your own personal loli, that every faction in the game is trying to steal.

This game innovates on many features that were presented in both of its earlier iterations. The combat is much quicker with all weapons, including buffs on the buster blade and variant scythe. Shield Charging, which is a new feature introduced in this game, allows you to close the gaps between Aragami running away while taking a chunk of your stamina. Also, Aragami now head to OP restore points, something that wasn't seen in previous versions. The acceleration trigger system and god arc abilities are much more expansive than their counterparts. It also now introduces a raid system, which makes it feel like a monster hunter game.

If anything, the most prominent and glaring issue with this game is its shallow story and uninteresting characters. In the beginning, the story is fascinating while implementing many thoughts into the player's mind, but that is quickly taken away once a specific character is introduced. From there on, the story's primary focus is this character, and it's vital role for the ending of the main story. That's not to say that this character isn't engaging in their own right, but they just don't fit the role. I felt that if any of the characters died, I honestly wouldn't care. This game does poorly on making the player genuine care about if these characters die or not. Another personal issue that I have with this game is how easy it is compared to its counterparts. I wasn't ever good at god eater 2, and I never finished 1, but this game honestly made me felt like I somehow chose the easy mode. I'm not saying let's do any souls-like difficulty, but it made you want the Aragami to try a bit harder. Finally, another issue I had with this game is how short it was compared to the previous ones. While the combat and everything felt nice, I was really hoping for more main story shenanigans, and I was shocked when I finished it in under really 35 hours. Most of the other hours I have were either me being idle or grinding for specific god arc materials.

With all of its unaccomplished desires and faster pace combat, this is a solid 7.3/10 for me. If anything, I would recommend buying this game when it goes on sale.",1578895978,1578895978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Being a fan of the Monster Hunter series and all the games that fall in the similar category, as well as having spent around 300 hours on Gods Eater: Burst on my trusty old PSP, and another 100 on God Eater 2 on Vita, I decided to give this game a go. And I'll keep it short - get it while it's on sale if you like these types of games.

The good:
- new weapons are an absolute joy to play, while the addition of new systems to the old, trusty weapons, make for a real pleasurable experience
- the visual revamp of this game compared to previous installments, including some of the UI and VFX, help make this game feel fresher
- game, at least up until difficulty 4, has a large variety of Aragami to fight - some of them are the same archetypes of enemies (for example Barbarius is largely reminiscent of Hannibal), others are entirely new, welcome additions
- the outfits, while fewer, all follow a similar theme (tape) and look great, making collecting them an experience of its own
- Ash Aragami - Aragami who grow stronger upon ""devouring"" God Eaters and change their attack patterns - are an amazing expansion in terms of enemy variety and I do hope to see more of them in the future
- Ein. Come on, I know you'll recognize him.

The bad:
- there are visibly fewer Aragami present in the game, unless the latter difficulties unlock the roster from previous games
- the game is noticably easier than the previous installments, with Burst Arts being the main culprit (even if they make the combat way more satisfying)

The ugly:
- the character customization is lackluster and leaves a sour taste in the mouth after the likes of Code Vein came out
- the story quickly devolves to what essentially is a close copy of the original GEB story (this time with Phym instead of Shio)

Overall, I don't have much to complain about. And I don't even want to nitpick - the game is very enjoyable and makes for great gaming sessions.",1577626076,1577626076,True,2,0,0.505909085273742676,0,True,False,False

Graphic:
- Better than the last two, of course.

-Have Crafting/Upgrade system.
-If you played MHW, this is easier to understand.

Playstyle:
- More ""Fast-Paced"" than the other two.
-The mobs is more badass.
- Add some new systems. Easy to learn, hard to master.
-Friends recommended, but if you wanna go solo, NPCs area always ready for you.
-""Class"" system....dunno what that is.

Storyline:
-Just like the other G.E. series.
-If you played G.E. before, remember final moments(?) at aegis? be prepared.

Fact of the matter is that the Keyboard and Mouse controls are broken, with strange set speeds and mouse acceleration, that make the game very slippery to play, and make it more annoying than anything else.   What's more odd is that God Eater 1 and 2's steam releases don't actually share this problem.  

The game isn't quite unplayable on KB&M, but it is severely annoying.  So there's the review.  Don't get this game, because it isn't fun to play.  Why is this game not fun to play?  Because the control method is nearly broken, and has remained so since its release.  They could invalidate my entire review easily by fixing this issue, but seeing as how it hasn't been fixed despite being a known issue since day one, I feel rather secure in saying don't buy it.

I played and loved the first two so you can imagine I was pretty excited when I heard this game was announced and even more so when I finally got the chance to play it.  But sadly, it fell extremely short of my expectations.  I'll be speaking from the single player point of view since I didn't do the online multiplayer which I can assume was far more exciting than the single player campaign itself.

The game takes place in a wasteland known as the Ashlands, and it's rightly named because the whole point of this game is that there is a mysterious deadly ash that covers the land and only certain God Eaters can survive in the ash, known as AGES or Adaptive God Eaters.  You start out as a sort of slave that's owned by a Port which is part of an organization called Gleipnir and are called out every now and then to complete missions and then sent back to your cell.  Obviously you and you're friends aren't happy with this and hope for a better life someday.  And wouldn't you know it, that better life shows up only after the first few missions when your Port is swallowed up by the ash storm and you're rescued by a travelling caravan, and that's the where the rest of story takes place.  

The main plot of the game is that the caravan is carrying important cargo that is said to be the weapon to save humankind.  But this weapon turns out to be a humanoid aragami child named Phym, you know, like Shio from the first God Eater.  And you have to protect her from the big bad Gleipnir who want to experiment on her.   I'll be honest here, as much as I liked the first game, I wasn't a big fan of Shio but at least it was interesting because in the God Eater universe they never heard of a humanoid aragami before so it didn't make a whole lot of sense to do it again here and make it sound like a huge deal again.  Phym is basically almost a  carbon copy of Shio except this time, she follows you everywhere on the caravan, I do mean everywhere for the whole game, and calls you daddy...  I don't know why she calls you that it was just a random thing the characters said for some reason.  Once Phym enters the picture, the plot of the game just tanks here.  The only role Phym truly plays in the game is she has anti ash elements which is why Gleipnir wants to experiment on her, and she also allows the characters the ability to fight new aragami known as Ash Aragami which were previously unkillable until Phym showed up.  I'm not gonna go into too much detail on what happens from there because 1) spoliers and 2) I don't care since the story REALLY sucks here.  Just know that once Phym shows up, the fun is pretty much over because all everyone in the whole game talks about is Phym this, Phym that.  Phym Phym Phym Phym for the rest of the game, I'm not kidding.  As messed up as this sounds, I was hoping Phym would be killed off as some point so I could have a chance at a real plot but nope.

Alright that's the gist of things here, now I'll list of some good and bad points of the game.  And like before, I'm speaking from the perspective of the single player aspect so online stuff is out here.  Okay good points first.

1) Good combat:  The combat in GE3 has improved quite well since the last two games.  Movement is smooth and combat is quick.  You can also do a new technique called Engage, which allows you to sync up with another character to combine your abilities with theirs, and make you stronger for a short time.  There's also a move that allows you to propel yourself forward quickly through the air.  I love this move and used it so much throughout the game, it makes chasing aragami much easier and traversing the maps quicker.

2)  Better graphics:  Okay, this is only slightly true.  The characters and the environment looked much better than the previous games.  Yeah some characters don't look all that great but overall I'd say it's pretty good.  At the least the visuals were appealing in this game.

Alright, now the bad points.

1)  Poor story:  Like I said before, the story really sucks this time around.  At first it's all about you and your friends trying to regain their freedom and start a better life for yourselves, and then Phym enters the stage and it's all about her now till the very end.  I won't spoil what happens but I believe Phym killed any chance of the game having a decent story.  The whole, clueless child learning how the world works and is innocent with their lack of understanding thing just really isn't my cup of tea.  

2)  Characters:  The characters in this game a very uninteresting.  I always felt that if any of them died at some point, it wouldn't really matter.  If the game gave you a chance to improve relationships then I might be singing a different tune here.  There's no side stories with the characters or anything like that so there's nothing there to really build a friendship and to give me a reason to care about them.

3)  Music:  The soundtrack is pretty bland to me.  Music in the first two games were actually good but here it sounds like they just didn't put any effort into it.  I can't even remember one track.  And there a several times in the game where the music was so loud it overpowered the dialogue and actually made me take out my headphones.

4)  Character Customization:  The character customization wasn't all that great in the last two games and it's really no different here.  I expected there to be more options since this is the third game in the series but it has the same amount as before.  Where customization really took a hit was the clothing styles.  There isn't much to pick from here and from what choices you have, the clothes look kinda stupid mostly.  I mostly wore the default clothing because it looked a bit better than the other choices.

5) Phym:  Yes, I'm listing Phym as a bad point here.  I know I mentioned her in the poor plot section but considering how much I dislike her, I think she deserves her own spot here.  Having a clueless 9 year old child who can barely speak following you around the entire time just isn't my idea of fun.  Also when every character in the game is constantly screaming her name in nearly every bit of dialogue, you get kinda of sick of it pretty quick.  I would've much preferred her to be absent from the story, maybe then the plot would've been a bit better because it seems kinda of lazy to reuse the same plot device from the first game, because all we really needed was another Shio.  Some people like her but I don't.  If there's anything good I can say about her in this game is her Engage ability is good, since it heals you in combat.

6)  Short game:  The game is very short compared to the first two games.  I have 40 hours on record but that's because I did a lot of extra missions and stuff and tried to upgrade my god arc.  Just don't expect a long adventure here.

7)  Easy game:  I was surprised at how easy this game was, not like GE and GE2 were that difficult but it was almost child's play here.  I died only once in the game and that was at the final boss and because it has a one hit kill attack.  They even bring back old aragami antagonists like the Dyaus Pita and Marduk as well as the Kyubbi but even then they are extremely easy.  Even the new aragami are easy so don't be intimidated with how they look.

That's all I can really say about it.  If you wanna try it, I recommend you wait for the sale to show up.  You might enjoy it more than I did.

Right now the game have very little content to offer which dev. told us to expecting more from future updates. Overall the game is fun and you better have friends to play with in multiplayer game since it's very hard to find public game at the moment.

----patch 2.20----
The game has more character episodes and extra challenge missions similar to the previous games and those missions make the game much more challenging but is it come close to the God Eater games that I love like previous two? This game still have a long way to go but so far both amount of content and game difficulty are in the acceptable amount and what do I mean by those two factor? 
First, the content. More mission has been added since the game was release, such as Extra Episodes, Character Episodes which will introduces you to the depth of God Eater 3 story and each back story of your companions and Challenge of the Hound for those players who want some intense Aragami hunting. Also more outfit and cosmetic that make this game feels much more like the God Eater game I know..which is the game that lets you dress up your character and depart for some Aragami hunting with stylish outfit. They also introduce the New Game+ feature which is self explanatory and the Jukebox feature is finally back and it came with several tracks from the previous games that I am sure those who are the series fans will remember. The character recreation has been added on this patch which allow you to completely recreate your character without importing the save file and lose all of your hunting record like the previous games this feature is actually nice since I am one of those players who want to try out different character design and such. 
Now the game difficulty, at first God Eater 3 didn't have any mission that I'd call ""challenging"" even the end game mission. but now the new Challenge of the Hound missions in patch 2.20 are much closer to the previous games difficulty which you can't just mindlessly slash the Aragami and win.
----Summary----
Right now if you're a new comer to the series I'd advice you to play the previous games first since they'll be some references to the previous games here and there during the story which personally I think you'll enjoy it even more if you played the first two. But if you insist on playing God Eater 3 first then you should grab it during the sales because even with those contents I mentioned above it still not worth the full price. If you're the series fans tho the game at the current state will be worth your time but I still suggest that you grab it during sales anyway. Overall God Eater 3 is a good game which offer so many improvements than the previous two in term of graphic and gameplay mechanic but still offering less content than the previous games.
Right now I will give it 6.5/10 and I will do the review again on the next patch.",1555576773,1576587775,True,3,0,0.522420525550842285,0,True,False,False

I highly recommend doing this if you own a Switch, as it lets you get a feel for the gameplay, which is where MOST of your time is spent, and you also have access to a FULL character creator.

Rarely I leave reviews, but God Eater 3 is perhaps one of my favorite games. It's far from perfect, and it has the misfortune of being compared to Monster Hunter World, as the two came out at comparable times. However, I feel it's rather unfair to compare these Monster Hunting style games to Monster Hunter. At this point I feel the game type has become its own genre, one that Monster Hunter definitely popularized. I've found more motivation in this game than ever in some of the BEST Monster Hunter games. A story, even if it's... not the best like in this, goes a long way, and the biggest thing this game does is get me invested in the group and each character, more specifically Phym. 

If you're looking to enter the God Eater series, I recommend starting with this game. Don't let that big 3 fool you, It's quite honestly the best one, sets itself up in a way that you don't really need a lot of prior knowledge to enjoy. The story is self-contained, with only a few wink and nods here and there to older games. While I wanted a bit more fanservice as someone who has played all 3 games with an unhealthy obsession, what I got was...passable.

Now, if you're already a fan of God Eater, I think you're doing yourself a disservice to not play this one. It's easily the best, with a few nods here and there to the first two games. This is disappointing because there's only ONE (count em. One) returning character as of this review, and the game doesn't really fully acknowledge it. It makes sense how it's handled, but I want more from it. I need to see more of the Far East. The game itself adds a load of new Aragami, and all the old ones look so clean you won't mind seeing them again anyways. Not to mention the new Dive Mechanic is a good compromise for the missing Predator Styles, still not making their return from GE:R. The combat feels way more fluid, and late game enemies feel less like damage sponges like they were in the first two games. This game truly benefits from not being a PSP game/PC port of a PSP game. Button real-estate is better utilized, and the game allows you to customize your controller settings too.

As with most God Eater games, I feel the story isn't much to write home about. It's easily my favorite in the series, and while I don't love any of the characters aside from Phym as much as some of the OG crews like Kota, Lindow, Julius, or Gilbert, I love them all equally. This is more than I can say about the previous games cast of characters. Spoiler Alert [spoiler]There are no real villains. There are antagonists, but anyone who turns out to be big villains are dealt with swiftly. No one seems to be a bad guy, just doing the things that don't fall in line with what you want AND I LOVED THAT[/spoiler]. 

The addition of new God Arcs also make this game interesting. While I'm not a fan of the Biting Edge, it and the Heavy Moon feel right at home, and the Ray Gun was a nice change of pace, EVEN IF it replaced my favorite ranged weapon option. Rest in peace Blast Cannon, may we see you in a future update.

Which is a good lead into the updates: They're awesome. So far all the updates have been free, adding new post-game story content, along with new clothes that are unlocked FROM THE START, and adding in features that should have been in the base game at the start. New Game +, the Jukebox, etc. One of my favorite things is the Character Remake function. After beating the game you can completely remake your character including name and codename, something I was only ever able to do in the previous games through Cheat Engine. Clothes are also 'Unisex' in a sense that if you swap genders, you won't need BOTH sets of clothing made.

I could genuinely go on for paragraphs about some of the new mechanics and changes compared to previous games, but I think I'll hold off. I give this game, as of 12/15/2019 a solid 8/10. I've had a lot of fun with it and I think a lot of other people will too. Good Eating!! No...no that was stupid... Uh good luck out there!",1576394626,1576394626,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The series has the problem that gameplay feels repetitive at times (a limited number of aragami to fight and a limited number of maps to fight on).

Where it excels is the amount of customization you can use to create your character (and since the first release, a few more options have been added), though at times it feels a far shot behind the previous two games. Especially considering outfits (that can be earned and crafted in the game) - there are many outfits that are very close in looks (and some are that close that I can't even make out the difference).

But what was important to me was neither of the above, but the story - to be honest, the main story is okay, nothing very special at the moment, but content has been added afterward: Content that explores some of the characters a bit more, and that has now managed to captivate me (Traversing the Past).

All the updates that have been released have added a few things to get things up to player-expectations (at least for those who have played the first two parts), and I think I can now call this a solid entry into the series (with updated graphics).

So, if you enjoyed the previous games, you can certainly get this one, and have fun. (Should you have played a previous one and found it too repetetive, then ... better not get it).",1575099446,1575099446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's much easier to run it in multiplayer which is good, because it feels like it really needs real players to tackle the harder missions. The flip side is that the story can be played through relatively rapidly, even if one goes through all the optional missions, so it can feel a bit short compared to the previous two titles. The gameplay flows well and there's always a weapon combination that can be made to work, so you're not always bored and stuck with the same style -- unless you want to be. Enemies seem to be more varied than the previous titles which can mix things up as well.

The extra content is very hard to get through and I suspect it's intended for players much more skilled at this genre than I am, so I haven't played much beyond the basic story missions. A lot of players seem to find the game way too easy, even for these difficult missions, so I can only think that the target audience is somewhere in between those who like the idea of this kind of game and those who are good at this kind of game. For me, sometimes it gets way too hard and time consuming, but most of the main content is much more playable.

Now yes other reviews do complain about the story or the character development, and they're not wrong, not at all. The story is a bit bland in comparison to God Eater Resurrection and 2 Rage Burst (the other two that I've played). Plus the character development is definitely lacking. I haven't finished the main story yet, but I'm very close to the ending, so I believe I can write this review now and tell you what exactly I think of it. 
The aragami are definitely in need of a buff and the npcs are in need of a nerf; everything dies before you can even get to it. Okay I don't mean that literally but you get the point: things die too quickly because the npcs deal too much damage. I've already mentioned the story and how it's a bit bland, but let me elaborate on that a bit (I'll do my best to not include spoilers). The story starts off with a quite bothersome introduction. We are introduced to all these characters that we can presume (?) are the mc's (main character's) long time friends. Now I know this might not seem like a big issue, but I just dislike being introduced to someone that the mc has known for a long time but we see them for the first time and are expected to know a lot about them. And this is where the character development lacks; we never get much insight on anyone other than I could say three characters at most. How am I supposed to feel for these characters if I don't know anything about them?
Okay, now moving on to the more positive side of this review because as you might've noticed, I do recommend playing it. I will do what I can to not be bias here (because I really like the God Eater series). Let's start off with the graphics- as that is a simple concept. This is a 3D anime game, and the graphics and model teams did very well with the design of the game, characters, aragami, and maps. This brings me to the next point: the aragami. The designs of old aragami remain loyal to the old ones, and so does their behavior. The only thing other than the stats for aragami that annoys me is the lack of balance sometimes (half of the time the aragami is unexpectedly strong and boom half of your healing pills are gone). The maps in this game are truly stunning with high settings on. Although I'm a bit bummed out that they didn't remake some of the old ones. But what can I expect, this game is set in Europe after all, not Japan like the previous titles. Continuing on the topic of maps though, the design of them and the layouts truly amaze me. Starting a mission always feels fresh, it's not really the drop in & out that God Eater 2 Rage Burst had in my opinion.
In conclusion, this game is really worth buying. It's constantly being updated with balance updates and new content, so the fear of errors staying as they were isn't there. I hope that my review can help you make your mind up about this game. And hey, even if you don't want to get it for the full price, get it when it's cheaper. Trust me you won't regret playing this.

Also being a bad writer and this being my first review makes it even more difficult, but let's get down to the nitty gritty.
Graphics- You like Anime? You'll like how the game looks, if you don't like anime then it probably looks bad to you.
Story- The story has lots of problems but it's not bad, it's alright but nothing to write home about.
Gameplay- This is the best part about any God Eater game in opinion, and GE3 amps it up to 11. Fast paced boss fight action for almost every single enemy you encounter, Just Guarding (guarding just before an attack hits you, negating all damage) is probably the most satisfying mechanic in any video game ever, and learning aragami patterns to do it consistently is extremely satisfying.
Music- The soundtrack in this game is phenomenal, it pumps you up to fight all devouring beasts at times, while also making you feel emotional about your daughter going missing (I'll get to that in the characters section)
Characters- You have a loli daughter in this game who calls you mommy/daddy depending on your characters gender, ain't that cute? Besides that, the characters are mostly believable people who you can relate to. They have their own internal struggles (though you mostly get to see that after finishing the game) and the VO is alright both in English and JP. Dual audio is a big plus, which a lot of japanese games don't have for whatever reason but GE3 does if you're worried about that.
If you like MonHun and want more of that, God Eater is the faster paced, anime cousin of MH.",1574957503,1574957503,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Being the same game, character creator is very limited and boring. Might as well not been there and just have a protagonist that talks and is a little more involved and invested with the other characters. Is 2019, silent protagonist are not a thing anymore, or can be done better.

Sound design and music is inconsistent, sometimes the music drowns the voices, other times you can barely hear it. The anime songs when fighting certain bosses are not bad, but lacks impact since is just 'there', no effort in pacing the song with the action.

Story I feel it tried to be a really personal one with a lot more of grey area and morality, but falls short because your character does not talk and cannot get involved in any way with your companions beside a simple question or affirmation every now and then. There was a lot of potential that get lost in the silent protagonist, weird pacing and the fact that the engine cant handle any form of cinematic. It really is the same game from PS portable from way back.

Gameplay is where the core of the issue is. The gameplay is fun, even if you are playing the same old game all over again. Fighting the aragamis is fun, doing the combos is great, building your character and all the complexities make for a great time. That been said, the game is very repetitive, you fight the same monsters over and over with some variations, in the same handful of stages that only work as arenas, there is nothing else to do there. You only wish that this was done in a modern engine and with maybe some more budget to truly appreciate it. 

The game is sort of hard as all previous God Eaters but with a more lenient progression curve. When the game gets hard you are already well into its working mechanics and you know what to do and how.

So, I cannot recommend the game.
People that likes the franchise since way back will play it regardless and will enjoy it even if they are playing the same old game.
Regular folks will get bored half way because the game is very repetitive, the story is not well told and the characters look outdated and very anime niche. And the game is just plain old with a paint coat.

In terms of gameplay, if you're familiar with the monster hunter formula then this follows a similar vein. However, the missions finish a LOT faster. This is mostly because your AI companions are actually not that stupid (surprisingly???) and how the entire progression of missions is generally fast, since that's how anime-style combat actually does happen. 

As someone who HATES being forced to grind to progress, this game was great because I often found that I could tackle missions and come out alive even with (only slightly) low-level equipment. The battles were engaging, the story and characters were okay (not frustrating, but I wouldn't call them fully fleshed out either), and it definitely does have a lot going on for it with how your enemies fight. Remember - your opponents are OP, but so are you. The final story battle was also a little different compared to previous installments of God Eater. While it's not the kind where ""IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE"", it felt more solid to me than any of the previous ones. 

Overall, the only thing I didn't like would probably be the lack of costume variety. The older games did it really well, but for this one I found myself using the same few 1 or 2 outfit sets for more than 80% of the story. But this is pretty minor.

This game has some unique points that whom had played MHW like me said ""This is different."". For example the Devour Attack or the progression of the game. For the convenience of those who read the review, I will compare this with MHW.

The game loop ----- Both of the games have similar loop - you hunt the monster, gain some new blueprints and materials, farm them and get the equipment, and hunt them again. I'd say the missions in GOD EATER 3 is too short for me, I like a good 10+ mins on one mission, but then again GOD EATER is a fast-pace game. So, I think it just fine.

The Main Mechanics  ----- This is interesting... These 2 games - when break it down to the core - it is basically the same, but it is so different. 
-The weapons here in GOD EATER 3 are easier compare to MHW. The Devour and Burst system is unique to this game and the overall feeling of hunting the Aragami is also more relax and fun(sometimes in MHW I want to kill myself). 
-The range weapon is a little bit, I would say ""Under-power"" for me. I mean it kind of useful when you are the support in the team, but for me it's not that good. 
-The crafting system is the only one that I'm not a fan. The game will not tell you directly how you can acquired the materials for crafting - like a hunting log from MHW. You can find the mission reward before select the mission, but if you don't know that, it's just a wild goose chase after something that you don't know yet. When play the game for the first time, I suggest you, open the wiki on how-to something that you want.

The story ----- At first, I expected that it will go on full-anime mode but it's not. Story is interesting, with the mysterious nature of the protagonist(our character), or it's just deserved as a plot point, the character development is also good and I can feel their emotion when enter the dialog or cutscene. I will say that GOD EATER 3's story can hook the player since the start. 
**And I recommend that you play with Japanese voice acting** 

So, I think this game is as good as MHW. I'll recommend this game to people who is new to this kind of game because it is a fast-pace and easy to understand the use of weapon or tools even though the game doesn't explain much. 
Overall, good quality game, as fun as MHW (for me anyway), interesting story, and good mechanics with its unique points.",1571325343,1571325343,True,24,1,0.718812942504882813,0,True,False,False

The game play is pretty dull, the missions ends too quickly for a full squad which makes the fights only engaging when u actually face it alone. There shouldve been a better difficulty scale for a full squad that doesnt end most of the missions in a flash.

WARNING: POTENTIAL SPOILER ON STORY TAB

Combat:

Combat mechanics are REFRESHED with new and far more balance features.

Acceleration Trigger & ENGAGE System has now replaced PLEDGE & Link Support System that was in God Eater 2. It requires more work to make it happen and the results may vary from one person to another since these 2 new system no longer give the player full IMMUNITY to dmg and timely burst status that can be set before missions. 

Combats are now faster, which I felt the Aragami has been slightly buffed with a 1-2 frames removed, but that's just me based on my experiences from Handheld hunts. 
Ash-Aragami can utilize Devour attacks that can't be blocked and can only be evaded or PERFECT GUARD. Majority of the Aragami now are very capable of spamming its skills more often unlike the previous 2 generations. 
It is unknown if developer plan to release the game by batches as the Variation of Aragami has been cut down. So far by the end of the story, I have not seen the variation of Aragami (FALLEN archetype) I find this bad since it gets a little tad boring knowing where are the breakable bonds are.

Burst Arts and BA:

Players are now able to equip up to 3 Burst Arts (JUMP, GROUND, STEP) and players can test out their build in the training room (preview) 

BA is new to the game where you can now attached an after/immediate effect to Burst Art for additional damage. BAs can also be preview in the training room.

^The Training Room feature is SUPER FRIENDLY but I wish they allow us to switch Aragami.

God Arcs:

(WEAPONS) 

God Eater 3 has introduced 3 new weapons (Heavy Moon, Biting Edge and Ray-Gun)
Let it be known that Ray gun was introduced to replace previously well-known Blast Gun which is amazingly broken for the abyssal dmg that it can deal with a single bullet. 

(GUNS) 

Like what I had mentioned above, not much notable changes aside from Blast Gun being replaced with Ray-Gun

   [CUSTOM BULLETS]
   
   Another powerful nerf that scraps the purpose of custom bullets. Players are no longer able 
   to fire custom bullets with OP and it is costly to fire one.

(SHIELD) 

Here comes the good part. Majority of the shield now has an element weakness. From what I know the amount of Neutral Shields weren't at such a low count before. so choose wisely what to craft and block with. 

(SKILLS)

God Arcs no longer provide skill(s) that are pre-installed in it and the slots can only be expanded by the means of upgrading your gears. 
Skill levels are now capped at level 5 instead of 10 and by the end of the game I have no encounter of skills that contain multiple skills.
Moreover the selections of skills are but a handful. Nothing that stands out from the rest. So I suggest to use them as it is or save them for your main build. Hopefully future content will expand the variety of skills that can be farmed.

This is a nerf to counter previous generation where players can stack over 40 skills in a single build.

(UPGRADE PARTS)

The underserved part of the nerf 
:'( 

Story:

The whole game takes more or less 30+ Hours. The current writing for this game might trigger or upset players who are familiar with the previous games as there are empty links between 2 and 3 but let it be know that God Eater: Resonant Ops is a direct sequel to God Eater 2 and Prequel to 3, hence it is a 2.5 (Kingdom Heart all over again trolol). Sad to the fact that God Eater: Resonant Ops is only released on MOBO and in Japanese, as of now I could not find any translated materials of the game story to widen the world of God Eater. 

(Someone should start a Theory post in the Forum) 

The (Time) in game is rather bad as 1 mission can be a month (Not referring to Intermission) after which really flip my trigger switch. Something in the story is pissing me off but the warm feeling of FAMILY keeps me intact. (Serious Note: Phym voice actress did an EXCELLENT Job, GDI SHE'S CUTE)

POTENTIAL SPOILER: 
The very reason why the story of God Eater 3 may trigger and upset others is the appearance of Soma under the alias; Ein. 
What happen to the rest of the team? What happen to this? What happen to that? What happen to him/her? 

Because of the 1 character it can possible cause an Ash Storm to what had happen to the world of God Eater between the time of 2 and 3. 

the Multiplayer is smooth as I have not suffer or encounter Disconnection. 

This is my review as of now. I might update in the future but for now. Let's leave it at this. 
Any comments are extremely welcome be it good or bad.

Edit (1): Chat system isn't impressive at all. 15 characters limit (including SPACE). Hopefully we see more word counts in the future but as of now. Chat as though you Tweet in its Prime days.

EDIT (2): Version 2.01

Latest updates include new challenges hidden as possible (+99 difficulty? [took me by surprised at the very least haha]
We will still be getting more updates in near future but it would be best for upcoming players to buy and play it with Friends. Online arent that reliable as I try to look for other frequent to exchange cards but sadly I have exchanged no more than 6 so that really speaks VOLUME for how the online are. 
Overall I am very used to the grind and am still crafting and maxing majority of the gears. Gotta make 1 for everything to keep myself occupied with it haha. 

So that is all for now.

But to explain the situation as a whole: When I was trying to get it to work properly for two hours the game crashed far too often for it to be worth the trouble. It crashed after character creation, reloaded. It crashed before the first mission, reloaded. It crashed when trying to start the second mission...I didn't bother reloading after that. I got my refund and went on my way as I genuinely attempted to get it working on here.

Now, where this game shines is very much on the same page many seem to say: The Combat is pretty decent, I suppose. But for returning fans who played pure gun and intended to stay back to assist the team from a distance I have bad news for you: [b][u]There is no 0 OP bullets anymore, you cannot remain in gunner mode indefinitely as you could in God Eater one and two.[/u][/b] If you do not like this idea, then avoid the game as a whole because I will admit I was not thrilled to try and remain in combat as some of the weapons still felt clunky for the Charge Spear but was pretty decent on the dual blades.

So do I think it is worth it? For some people who enjoyed being in the middle of the fray in the first two games or are newer to it and aren't set in stone for the old gunner play style, you may enjoy it. But be warned that it may come with a list of issues that are unknown and may cause random crashing while trying to play on this platform.

Enjoyable gameplay, story is average but it's better than ""local idol sings and prevents devouring apocalypse"" looking at you ge2.
A wide variety of weapon types that appeal to most if not all, playstyles.

Devs do a decent job at introducing additional content in the form of free DLC, such as new character episodes, Time Attack missions,outfits and new weapons/monsters to farm and balance adjustments, with more coming during the 2.x patch series (such as new game + and the ability to redesign your characters appearance). While there are a few issues such as the hitboxes being pretty jank, I personally  feel it's a very strong entry into the franchise.

My only real gripe with it is the lack of difficulty but it sounds like the devs are working on addressing that in the 2.x patch cycle with the announcement of a new mission that is supposedly very difficult (p99 2.0????)

Easily the best entry in the trilogy, GE3 does nothing bad but at the same time manages to leave nothing memorable in its wake. Detailed review follows:

Story: The biggest draw away from other MH clones is that GE has always been very story focused. A lengthy campaign with tons and tons of side missions, assault missions and special missions means that your time will be well spent and you will get your bang for buck. The story as a whole is nothing memorable and frankly, only the very last mission had any semblance of quality writing but one has to ask themselves if forcing yourself to slog through just another typical, cliched JRPG story just to reach that point is worth your time. Characters have strong visual design, but are all uninteresting typical anime tropes found in every anime video game and show ever. 

Gameplay: Much more developed than the wreck that was GE2, GE3 introduces a lot (sometimes, too much) of mechanics, cool looking moves and a couple of new weapons that make combat enjoyable to a degree. Despite this sometimes overload of mechanics, each weapon only has essentially 2 combo strings and that's it. Fighting Aragami is a fairly brainless task without any difficulty whatsoever, with even the hardest fight taking a maximum of 10 minutes so as long as you have gear for that tier. AI for Aragami is woefull unintelligent, though the AI for your companions is quite good for the most part.

Visuals: Some of the best anime-esque visuals in anime-styled games at the moment, one thing GE3 does remarkably well is look quite good for the type of game it is. Visual fidelity is not astoundingly high like most AAA games, but it is certainly a step above typical anime titles. The 2D VFX are particularly very impressive and tastefully done, with streaks of strong colour combinations that really emphasize attacks from the player as well as the Aragami. Map design is quite basic and uninteresting. 

Sound: A slew of mostly borderline gothic orchestral tracks which, while nice, feel quite overblown and create a very high-strung atmosphere for the game which often conflicts with its gritty story and characters. Subs and Dubs are available to freely switch between for voices. Dub is nothing remarkable but it is not awful to listen to, so that is always a plus. Weapon SFX are strong, intricate and really emphasize the nature of the weapon being used.

All in all, a well-made game that unfortunately tried to play too safe and too careful, ultimately resulting in a very average experience and components which prevent it from standing out. If you were after Big Game Hunting gameplay, Monster Hunter is still the king of the hill, by miles and miles but God Eater 3 will make sure it has solid content for every dollar you pay.",1566384944,1566384944,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

As far as I can tell the only problem I see with the game so early, is that most of sprites like characters, monsters etc. in the game seems ""weightless"". Like you see swords clashing and there is no impact or whatever behind it. It's hard to explain. 

EDIT:
After spending some more time in-game, I wanted to share some more, so here it goes.

PROS:
- Game is faster paced than for instance Monster Hunter: World and I like that, but that makes fights less tactical and more reaction based. For some that's plus for some it will be minus. I find it cool.
- Lots of stuff to craft: items, weapons, ugrades, skills.
- a lot of weapons with unique playstyles, also  you can carry melee and ranged weapon and switch on the fly. It's more fun that way compared to MH:W.
- I like OST and I wasn't tempted to turn it off, but sometimes it just goes silient out of blue and thats wreid. 

CONS:
- Levels look kinda bare-bone, small and there isn't too much of them. Kinda bummer, but I know for sure it's engine problem. Every game made in it looks like that from level design perspective or even worse.
- For game that revolves around hunting monsters, coop features doesn't strike me as well implemented. I would like to see more players and less NPCs.

It's good game and I wish it had continuation with more robust maps and general improvments in coop department. I also wish for practice room like in MW:H. I have no big complaints about game, so it's definitly worth a purchuse, if you are into this kind of games.

- Weapons ( Almost every single aragami only nets u 2-3 weapon , except the worst offender being Dyaus Pita who in GER had some of the best looking weapons but in this game was heavily shat on by the devs , he only has 3 weapons to offer and its the least used weapons in the Dyaus Pita series , so thanks Devs )
- Gameplay ( GER and GE 2 RB has really good mechanics , however those mechanics dont seem to exist in this game despite supposedly being the "" sequel "" or "" better "" or "" polished "" version of the previous games , one of which i was a little disappointed by was the lack of devour types that GE:R had )

The story is kinda short compared to the previous games, but its still a must-buy for GE fans. While GE and MH are on their own leagues, GE3 is still a really fun game in terms of intense, in-your-face action, chock-filled with chaotic battles with multiple aragami's on high-rank missions. I personally like chasing down the aragami with the new dive mechanic when they try to escape and rest, leaving them no room to breathe. Buying this game at its full price does not disappoint.

- Character customization (you can also craft new clothing when you progress through the story)

Where this game succeeds is in its many improvements from its predecessors (GE2).

+ Camera Controls are Superior to Prior Titles and heavily polished upon since release.
+ Overwhelming amount of actions which differentiate the good and the beginner.
+ Intense fast paced action combat with varying play-styles to fit the player.
+ Awesome Fashion Options for the fashion hunters out there.
+ Interesting Story + CUTSCENE GALORE
+ High quality graphic capabilities and beautifully ravaged world.
+ Custom Bullets; make your own unique bullets that give you a degree in pyrotechnics.
+ A GUN, A SHIELD... AND A MELEE WEAPON IN ONE? Count me in!
+ Jiggle Physics, maybe a con, umm gonna keep it here.

-/+ Anime artstyle; maybe you like, maybe you dont?; + Fans of Code Vein/Tokyo ghouls, try this out...

- Game is very repetitive, as a fan of all monster hunter and GE titles this is to be expected, However in God Eater,
   You have reason to fight the same monsters,  MH waste of time some monsters are.
- Facial expression during running animations in central hub...
- Potential for so much more encounters,
- Map pool, increases over time however
- Controls can be hard to learn and remember after long breaks (REWARDS PLAYERS WHO LEARN)
- ! Devour animations based on melee weapon no longer change !
- Difficulty Curve is lacking, Missions are definitely fail-able if not prepared however as you progress.

I was wrong.

I like the combat from Monster hunter a lot, so I thought I wouldn't enjoy the rather intense fast paced anime combat GE offers. Turns out I'm a sucker for anime games and fast paced combat.

I like to think of the Burst Art System in this game similiar to like Hunting Styles or Hunter Arts from Mhgu.

Weapons in this game are 3 in 1, you have melee weap of choice, gun of choice and a shield of choice. Weapons lets say performance is determined by elemental damage. In GE ele isnt a flat dmg increase like in Mh, it's a dmg multiplyer which really makes conllecting different kind weap to have one for each ele more worthwhile and fun!

GE doesnt have ""armor"" but just have uh clothes? Skins? forgot the word.. basically just ""armor"" for appearence. But skills you can only get installed on your weap, gun and shield, some have more slots for installing than others and so on.

Concept-wise Monster hunter and God eater are pretty much the same which is probably another reason why I fell in love with GE.

This games stroy is meh, but you play GE for its gameplay anyway. I did hear that the story from the previous 2 games were amazing. I was told by some veteran player that I can play through GE3 and then catch up on the story. So rn Im playing Ge rsurrection and boi it really feels like a psp game, but I can manage.

For those who dont wanna play the past 2 games to cath up on the story, ig go watch some playthroughs on them both?

- Combat feels more quicker and engaging... But I'm a sucker for Dual Blades which can turn into a Glaive 
- Graphics are beautiful.
- Character creation is also fantastic... No it's not just because of the jiggles ;)
- Unique Aragami have new mechanics which can make the game more difficult.
- Raids are fun if u get a full lobby, even if you don't get a full group the game partners you with AI's.
- Phym is just the cutest.

CONS
- Whats with the tapes!?!?!?!
- Needs more costumes, especially on the level of God Eater 2
- I miss Nana

Having enjoyed GE2: RB quite a bit, I expected to like this game, but I actually ended up loving it. Most of the old Aragami enemies are back in this version, along with a slew of new ones; some of whom are real assholes, but would you want it any other way? There are fewer enemy reskins in this one, which means about the same number of monsters overall, but more original ones, so definitely a good thing. 

The ability to take 3 blood arts into battle instead of the previous 1 is one characteristic that really makes this game shine. This allows you to mix and match to create your own custom combos. Some are much stronger than others, of course, and there are also some moderate balance issues between weapons. For example, the buster blade can be tweaked for some crazy fast attacks considering the game calls it the ""slowest"" weapon, while the new biting edge is supposed to be high, sustainable DPS, but requires you to micromanage stamina and stances so much it falls a bit short. But with all the weapons, weapon mods, blood arts, control units (an accessory item), and the new engage mechanic there are so many ways to customize your playstyle vs something like MHW that even the less powerful weapons can still be fun.

To be fair, I consider God Eater and Monster Hunter to be pretty different games, and both really good in their own right. But I have come to prefer GE3 for its customization options, faster pace of combat, and aesthetic style (although MHW indisputably has better graphics). Also Claire.

Other things to consider:
-The story is okay, nothing special, and the voice acting in English is good for most of the characters.
-A fair amount of cosmetics. Not as many as GE2RB, from what I remember, but enough to keep it interesting. Requires a high tolerance for electrical tape.
-Multiplayer is touch and go. If you have friends to play with, you're set, otherwise don't expect a big lobby to choose from. They did, however, add an Assault Missions category, which auto-matchmakes you into a 5:00 fight with 7 other people. At least that's the idea. Usually it will just drop you onto a team of bots, who don't do enough damage to help you kill the boss in the time limit unless you're overgeared. But when you can get a team of real people (see: peak times) it's much more doable.
-Have decent dental insurance because Phym will absolutely give you cavities.

I also want to add a PSA for fellow mouse and keyboard users: This game has an integrated mouse smoothing (or acceleration, I don't know, I just refer to either one as garbage) that you currently cannot turn off via options. It's a port for console degenerates, so you shouldn't be surprised. However, Windows 10 (and maybe other OSes) also has mouse smoothing on by default. If you do not turn off Windows mouse smoothing, this game will be damn near unplayable, because both smoothing applications will be active at the same time, meaning it will feel like you're wrestling with an invisible chimpanzee when trying to aim the camera. So turning off the OS smoothing is your best bet unless someone makes a mod or something. I managed to get used to it, and I'm a M+K snob.",1562713007,1562713642,True,2,0,0.527248859405517578,0,True,False,False

I watched the anime first to get a vibe for the world, and have been saving up to buy it as i've been having money trouble. i finally had enough, bought it, and its terrible. I wish i could've tested it first. this has been such a huge bummer. also, as a side note, i legitimately could not figure out how to swap to my gun atks? lol the symbol it tells me to use is an upward pointing arrow. the up arrow isn't correct. w isn't correct, 8 on the num pad is not correct. i legitimately could not figure it out and most of my regular weapon atks just looked like me flailing in circles because the movement and camera angles are so jacked up.
if you want smooth movement and camera angles,this game is 100% not for you
if you like MHW's crap movement, this might be for you. but bear in mind, the camera view is liightyears more sensitive in this game.

The game gives you time to get used to the monsters and provides you with plenty of choices how to tackle them.

More than enough melee weapons, each with an  unlockable set of attack options, each of which can be customized with an additional effect.
As for ranged weaponry... you want to fire a cluster bomb or a hail of seeking explosives?
You can make it yourself with the bullet customisation feature.

The combat is more streamlined then ever and the missions are still short hunts perfect for farming or if your short on time. And the DLC has been completely free so far with 2 content patches add and more on the way.

That said there are a couple things I take issue with in God Eater 3

1. Game feels like a graphically enhanced PSP game. If you where expecting the first God Eater made for the current generation of consoles and PC to make full use of the larger memory and processing that these machines provide much like how Capcom did with Monster Hunter World guess again , this title feels and plays very close to God Eater 1 and 2 with a small hub location and small maps with only around 6 different locations.

2. You feel like a side character in the story at times. Going from God Eater 1 where you start off as a newbie in Fenrir and grow into the leader of your group of God Eaters, the story was centered around your character, this game however I always felt like I'm doing everything for someone else's goals and dreams with no real say.

The preview screenshots fooled me. The 79-91% positive reviews fooled me. Customizable character fooled me. After 5 hours of this utter boredom and (almost) beating 2 chapters (and what feels like 20 same-ish missions) I uninstalled it. Under the cover of monster hunting and boob physics lies pletora of garbage design choices and pacing as slow as it's possible. Combat is X-button mash with occasional jumping and holding Y to bite monsters. There are guns here, but they don't ever feel like they make any impact. There's a shield to block monster attacks, but why even bother? In 2 chapters I never had to block. And the consumables that aren't needed, except for the healing item? just sold them for cash I never ended up using.

Gameplay loop is just A) dispatch to a small area, B) Kill 5 enemies, with optional C) pickup items from preset positions, then it repeats on the same map with 5 probably different enemies, and if you're lucky, at a different time of day. Graphics are ok for a game that tries to show cell-shaded 3d anime characters. 

Now how about autosave feature? You'd think that in 2019 it's a given. Well, allow me to introduce you - the Semi-Auto save. It will ask if you want to overwrite existing save every time! After every mission! Until you go to settings and disable saving after missions and fall back to 1996 with manual saving.

Story? just meh. Wacky writing (or is it translation? Why do some characters say ""are they"" about my character? are they afraid to use a wrong pronoun and offend someone?). The character is an empty doll who passively participates in cutscenes, no voiceover whatsoever despite game having around 20 variants for their voice, with not just grunts and breath, but with actual phrases. Why? Because japanese game design. You can't just have 1-3 fully voiced variants. So here's dilemma: either you listen to not-so-good English and count inconsistencies, or play with Japanese and have no idea what they are talking about during fights.

Anyway, I refunded a game only once in a lifetime. I thought couple of times about refunding God Eater 3, but that was when I was 3-4 hours deep, so not a chance. I guess this game is just too niche and might be of interest to the actual fans of God Eater 1 and 2. But I'm a first-timer, and this game did more to spook me off than to hook me, and from now on I will be careful with japanese games.

for starters the  heavy moon and bitting edge are not bad welll at least heavy moon. Biting edge was pretty garbadge on launch but they made it at least not a pain to play.

the main selling point (at least to me) is the engage and Dive. Engage is a mechanic where if 2 players fight near enough with each other they can activate it, when activated engage skills are in effect like both who activated it run faster or they get small recovery over time. The best thing of doing engage is the fact that benefits are being shared between the two. For example if 1 player is burst 3 (to keep it short makes you deal more dmg) the other one gets it too. 

The dive is also a new feature that bascly allows you to get near the enemy and travel the world faster. my minor complaint that I have is that if you want to run away for lets say a devour (more on that in a bit) you cannot face the opiside direction and use it. you have to (unless you are not locked on) unlock and then dive. While the game does state that you dive on who ever is locked on its just a minor complaint I have.

last thing I will talk about the gameplay department is the devour mechanic. to avoid confusion I mean the aragami devour. There are few aragami that  can devour (such as Anubis and Ra) and once they hit you you get corrupted a state where you cant get bust from others, not being able to engage and once you die in that state you lose 3 respawn points. however the game does warn you before hand when they will use it (for the most part).

now about the story. while I did enjoy it I think its somewhat weaker compaired to its earlyer titles and its also abit shorter than 2 at least at the time writing this review. while the characters were likable I do think if the game had more time  I think I whould love some of the characters. I am not saying the story is bad I just think its a lil weaker if you come from god eater 1 and 2.

overall I think you should get this game if you are a fan of god eater and I think a  decent point for a newcommer aswell",1562068233,1562068233,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The story was really enjoyable and had decent amount of character interactions like previous games. Of course, the content amount is more measured in comparable to the previous games' pre-burst editions so it does not contain the same amount of content as GEB/GE2RB (Character episodes/event quests/etc). But, they do seem to have plans on adding onto the game with free updates, some already that have released but as of the review I have not checked it out.

The GE series are for sure a faster paced hunter(monhun) type of game with more of a story side towards it's universe. It was a really fun story driven coop game with play with friends.

While Monster Hunter's gameplay is a little slower paced, rewarding positioning, preperation, and intelligent calls, God Eater 3 is a fast-paced slashfest with high mobility and aggressive combat.
Unlike Monster Hunter, I haven't felt the need to secure specific consumables and craft a variety of different damage type weapons to keep up with my quarry. While it maybe would have made things easier, it wasn't needed to complete the mission.
The visuals are great, as well - its style as an anime-esque game invokes the graphical displays of games like Naruto Shippuden or Dragonball Xenoverse, but in its own unique settings and with a special polish that I can't put my finger on. The music, while having the generic style of most anime games (and if you play them, you know what I'm saying) is still enjoyable and adds to the combat, rather than distracting from it.
And finally, the story. As I said, it is linear, and the cutscenes can go for quite some time, but the game tells a coherent story, and I find myself growing attached to different characters. The animations are, for the most part, spot on and feel natural and realistic, and the characters are expressive, with the typical exception of your mostly emotionless player character, who communicates with head motions and subtle eye and mouth movements. The only issue I really have with the cutscenes is the audio won't always sync properly, providing disjointed periods of chaotic sound, followed by silence when the previously played sound should have made itself known.
All in all, is it a good game? I think so. I do think this isn't for everyone, and while not liking Monster Hunter may not mean you dislike God Eater 3, it is less likely you will like it if you simply did not like MH's combat in general.",1561869717,1561869717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is a game that, when you get actually in the game play, it gives you this taste of a Monster Hunter-like combat system that only makes you want to hop on MHW instead (atleast for me)

The anime cutscenes (with your character) are great and the Character Creation is amazing (which is something I have come to love in BANDAI NAMCO games). BANDAI NAMCO knows what they are doing in the CC department and they always show this in their games. 

I believe that [unless you are a HUGE fan of this ""go to an area and kill a monster"" style of game] GOD EATER 3 is a great game for those who didn't feel quite at home with MHW but still love this style of endless boss fights with monsters.

The movesets are also somewhat customizable with burst arts. So you can change how you move just a bit to make the movesets flow even better. If you're just looking at the combat aspect of the game, go ahead and grab this game.

My problem is with the content. It's lacking. Apparently they're adding more content over time so it may be better to wait for the game to be out longer for more content. I wish there were more different aragami to fight. The ash aragami, which are the major bosses of this game, feel far to spread out and spread way too thin. I was having the most fun fighting an ash aragami, especially if they got a devour off of your team and powered up themselves. I wish there was more of that in this.

The story is...fine. It's an anime story, freedom, changing the system, that sort of stuff. It's not a bad story, just generic. If you're okay with that you'll probably enjoy the story.

Rage burst 2 has a lot more content and more interesting story, 
from the first hour of this game i predicted how this would end.

I would really love this game if it had less combat and more character interactions, combat is extremely repetitive, The characters are interesting and have personality.
had some cool new features that were interesting for about 10 minutes.


why does everyone have giant monsters chilling in their bases? ... am i killing their pet monsters?

buy on sale or better yet buy god eater rage burst 2,

Really unsatisfying, hitting things has 2 pronounced effects to make you feel it: black goop on your screen (at first, you might think it was you that got hit) and your character going ""HYAH!"". There is one viable strategy: torpedo to enemy, spam burst attack. The guns don't seem to do anything and neither does dodging. If the enemy is flying then everything seems to do literally nothing.

Controls:
This is an obvious console port. There's camera acceleration and deceleration, neither of which can be turned off. You have keybinds that don't make sense (press E to dodge, wat?) and that are tied to other controls (press E to dodge, use, pick up, etc). 

Progression:
In a typical JRPG fashion, you can upgrade everything in small increments. You want to upgrade the weapon? Alright, first off, buy a new weapon, then equip the weapon with as many upgrades as you can (if you don't have good upgrades in your inventory, go grind them and remember that upgrades have levels), then equip the weapon with an ability and then equip the weapon with an install (?) and equip the weapon on yourself. Then choose the weapon attack upgrades that you will be using. I feel like at some point you're gonna get to literally upgrade your upgrades.

Graphics:
Just looking around it looks okay. Not 50€ okay, 30€ okay. They go for an anime look but as we all know, 2D waifus are best.
But during combat, whoo boy, your screen is constantly splattered with black goop. When it's not the goop, you have constant sparkly effects that literally everything causes. So most of the combat your screen will be 60% black goop underneath which you have 30% unicorn puke, underneath which you have 10% of whatever scrotal monster you're probably aiming close enough to. Also, someone mentioned a nvidia bug, which makes the game use your integrated cpu graphics - it's true but luckily easily fixed. All in all, the game is really well optimised, running at (the locked) 60FPS on a laptop with GTX1050, maxed out graphics.

Writing:
Well, it's an anime game. It has anime writing, including the dialogue, I'd rank it above Naruto but well below My Hero Academia. If you want an anime game with better plot (and ""plot""), Devil May Cry surprisingly beats this. It's not horrible, it's just eh. However, I find it inexcusable, that certain voice actors are recorded with some low quality microphone - you had clear and clean voices up to Lulu, why does she have static in the background? And speaking of voice acting, if you get this game then turn off combat voices, there's enough chaos going on without you and your teammates screaming constantly.

Conclusion:
While playing with my girlfriend, we both realized that this game is garbage about 3 hours in, revoking our right for a refund. Up to that point they stretch things out and give you new features, making you think it might get better once the tutorial ends. It didn't.

It is a nice game, but it feels like someone made an anime, then transitioned it into game engine, then padded it with battles at every 2 minutes mark - battles you ahve to beat so you can continue watching.

In this game there's significant discrepancy between production values in cutscenes and the movies and actual gameplay.

Character editors are nice, there are nice maps as well, but EVERYTHING is heavily reused, and you'll see the same time dozens of times, over and over again. Same applies to enemies, there are reskins, retextures, there are a lot of similarities and so on. At the same time every cutscene is voiced, and apparently plenty of them used mocap (or animators were very talented). This doesn't qutie make much sense to me.

The amount of missions you have to complete is quite large, but they're similar, they're mostly filler that you have to beat in order to continue watching the story. Typically the game introduces a monster, then several chapters later you'll see its reskin, then it'll be on another map, then it'll be paired with another monster, and so on. It is kinda similar to Monster Hunter World, but Monster Hunter World had gorgeous environments which were huge and open for exploration. In this case environments are nice, but they're heavily reused, and nobody really lets you ever explore anything.

I found combat to be quite dull, although there's a great degree of optimization, customization, tons of apperances for your character and multiplayer. 

I barely managed to beat the game, not because it is hard, but because after several dozens missions tedium caused by repetition becomes nearly unberable.

Still, the ending wasn't bad.

So there you have it.

A fairly odd game, that feels like an anime with combat engine bolted onto it for some reason. If you're interested in story line, you'll have to grind through the annoyingly similar story missions to see the rest of the content, which is definitely not for everyone.

For whatever reason the latest AMD Adrenalin software was not playing ball with my Intel HD graphics driver I installed a few months ago. Completely removing the Intel Graphics Driver and installing a new one completely resolved the issue and now the game plays on max settings 1080p hovering between 40-50FPS on my old Alienware 17. The game is actually quite optimised.

As someone who played Phantasy Star Online for over 2,000 hours back in the day, I really love the sci-fi anime setting and mission grind for components and mulah to get up to the next Rank. The music is pretty orchestral and only kicks in during direct contact with the enemy to effectively up the stakes and feeling of epicness. I particularly love the moveset of the Heavy Moon. Nothing is more satisfying then that Chainsaw Axe move where you continuously cut at the enemy until they manage to get away or interrupt you.

There is a SHITLOAD of customisation in this game, holy crap. First, you have melee weapons, then guns and your shield. You go into battle with each of these pieces of equipment at once and there are multiple customisation slots for each of these pieces of battle gear. You customise equipment using abandoned God Arcs you will find plenty of during missions. (These are kinda like gems from Diablo) You can really design your own warrior, choosing different Burst Arts (of which there a shitload to choose from).

The graphics are great, (doesn't this game have the best anime intro ever, other then maybe Tales Of The Abyss?)

There will be of course comparisons to Monster Hunter but the big advantage to this game: the animations let you really move like the OP protagonists from your favourite anime. This game doesn't have that tactical, cumbersome feel of Monster Hunter and rewards quick thinking and reaction times. Hell with my Heavy Moon I love to use this ridiculous move where your start spinning like a massive sawblade in the air cutting through your foes.

Anyway, if you like sci-fi, grinding for loot and anime tropes you'll love this game.

✓ Fuckload of customisation for your Hound
✓ Move like an anime protagonist.
✓ Awesome orchestral score.
✓ Detailed and pretty post-apocalyptic vistas
✓ Monster designs have this uniformly dark foreboding look to them, with pretty nice attention to detail. Most of them look like they came from the Ruins stage in PSO.

x The customisation is overwhelming and I feel there could be better explanation.
x The game is a bit overly easy, it takes a really long time for the game to start to feel challenging. Mainly because I'm 20 hours in with the same character in Rank 5 missions and it's just starting to feel somewhat challenging. Like I feel just now I have to actually bother to learn how to maximise my loadout performance because I'm just starting to get knocked out now (never ran out of endurance in a mission yet).",1559615885,1560250660,True,6,0,0.574513375759124756,0,True,False,False

I didn't have any idea it was being made, and I loved the first two games to death enough to give this one a shot as well. After finishing it... I'll be honest and simply say that I enjoyed it. 

What differs this game from God Eater 2: Rage Burst is very little. It has big monsters, big weapons, and flashy fast combat. The graphics are heavily evolved in comparison though, and the HUD is much smaller and better designed. 

Yet there were a few thins that kind of let me down. 

First was the story. I felt as if it was significantly shorter then God Eater 2's campaign, and it took a while to actually get going. I low-key got some Gundam Iron Blood Orphans vibes from MC (you) and Hugo (MC's best friend), but it only bothered me in the beginning. I thought that, in general, the whole story was quite cliche; or rather I should say something you would see in some generic 12 episode action anime (but most likely worse then the actual God Eater anime itself). I wanted to know why the direction was shifted away from the East and into Europe all of a sudden, or why the Ashlands were never mentioned back in the last game, but as time went on I found myself not asking questions anymore and just decided to go with the narritive and assume everyone knows more then me. 

Second was the characters. I won't say that I cared any more then I did back when I played God Eater 2, but I sure had a bit more exposure with the characters then what I was given now. Believe it or not those team building missions really made a difference in terms of who I started to care for on my team. Not to mention that the characters in God Eater 2 were actually interesting. In comparison, the team mates in this game I found to either bland or annoying. 

Third was missing mechanics. The one I miss the most was Blood Rage. There are things that are kind of similar in this game, but its not the same. [spoiler]I actually went back to Rage Burst just to do the blood rage, and I can confirm that it is significantly better then the alternatives here[/spoiler]. Another one that is missing is, as I said before, the additional character missions. I felt more connected and more invested with the characters after I played the missions and got my affinity higher with them (getting that cut scene was SOOOO rewarding, especially on the much harder difficulties). The last one I care to mention is that I couldn't customize every detail of my teammates. It seems like a little thing, but being able to change certain things about them so they could fit my playstyle a bit better would go a long way into making the game a tad easier.  

Fourth was the difficulty. I felt it stayed pretty standard the entire time. Unlike in Rage Burst where I could feel the difficulty over time, God Eater 3 just threw you into the deep end. Most of them hit harder, and can even combo you now. 

I'm gonna cut this off here. This game has its flaws yes, but did I enjoy it any less? No. I really like this game. The dev's keep updating it, and I am currently playing through the new extra chapter right now. Hopefully some of the stuff absent from from Game Two will be added in after the fact, but until that happens, God Eater 2: Rage Burst stands as better then its sequel. 

But give this one a shot too.",1549871604,1558944574,True,1,1,0.519208133220672607,0,True,False,False

Got a new laptop with medium spec, which is ""playable"" on high setting

i7-8gen
gtx1050ti
8gb ram

after few hrs i put inside this game,heres my review about the diffrent between ge3 and gerb/ger/geb

Ge3 combat system is more to ""team work with devour"" instead ""devour that aragami and use the bullet to give the aragami a bad time such as lightning maul(vajra) give a trap like bind""

In ge3 theres no aragami bullet instead it just a link burst only , for guns instead blast gun, they change into laser which have same reserve op animation as blast but shoot diffrent, idk why they replace black with laser.For customisation, they put a lot of it inside the game.

The main werid thing is, breakable bond is more easy then the older game,

They replace blood art with accelaration trigger and and something bond.

For multiplayer
Dev need to add ""can join people's game while they are in game(outside mission)"" because most of time i cant find a multiplayer and im trying to fight assasult mission but theres no player around me, its kinda bored


Here is my spec

Processor = i5-3230m @2.60 GHz
GPU = GeForce GT 635m
RAM = 8Gb 
Storage = 500GB
OS = Windows 10 pro 64-bit

i play it on all low setting and got unplayable frames, when not in mission, got decent 30-50 but when in mission, sometimes got from 8-14 basiccly unplayable.

Played few min , as a fan from god eater burst , this all i can say.

Pro
-Graphic has improve.
-Character?? the MC(Us) still the same guy that cant talk except grunt.
-They added 2 new weapon which is a twin short blade and an interesting weapon called ring blade which remind me of Tira from Soul Calibur series and also Sun Shangxiang from Dynasty warrior series.

Cons
-Dont know about lip sync, few words does'nt sync with mouth sometimes.
-games start off with high sensitive camera which it stated medium, i give a minus point coz theres no slider option on sensitive.

NOTE

I will update more about this game when i get a decent pc to play with.",1549646794,1558408946,True,2,6,0.443469226360321045,0,True,False,False

Even though I don't have many hours on both previous said games. I played those games on PSP and Vita


 [h1]Positive points 	[/h1]

1. Added two new melee weapons: Biting Edge and Heavy Moon, both fit the setting and are already used by many players.

2. Added one new ranged weapon: Ray Gun. It is a replacement for the Blast Gun, which was present in all previous installments

3. Added 19 brand new Aragami. 7 of those employ a new mechanic. They can devour the player or teammates to go in a burst stand themselves. Apart from a general power-up, it changes their move set. This can be seen as little as one or two new attacks to some even growing an extra arm and using it is a whole new way.

4. Burst Arts: Same as the Blood Arts from GE2 (RB) but they can only be used once you are in Burst Mode. To balance this you can use a total of 3 different BA. One for ground, step and jump.

5. Introduces 2 new items/mechanic and overhauls one.

5.1 Engage: a system which uses a meter and go's up based on time and the proximity of you and your teammates in battle. The closer you and your teammates are to one other and the Aragami the faster it fills up. Ones it is full it can be used to get two effects for a short duration.  One effect is the one you chose beforehand and the second is the effect your teammate has. This can range from an attack-up, increased movement speed, devour speed,....

5.2. Acceleration Triggers: A change of the Burst Units. Now those don't auto activate on Burst Mode but only when completing in game conditions. E.g ""Use guard to prevent 100 damage."" effect: Restores HP in increments of 2 for X seconds. These Triggers can be improved which increases the effect or the duration. Subjectively I like this. It mixes up the play-style or rewards your play-style.

5.3. Burst Control Unit: normally these unit did what the above did but with the conditions. They are still the same here. Once you go in burst mode it auto activates: the difference here is that they no longer define your 'class' but complement your play-style. E.g. Increases melee and gun transformation speed, prevents debuffs, increase Zero Stance stamina recovery,...

6. Deuteragonist: While previous games had many side-characters than fill the story, the main focus was on you the player. You were ""special"" compare to all others in the story. You had a special skill nobody had or an immense high level other could only dream of. 
E.g. 
In the first you were one of the only 2 new types and you had a superior Resonance ability, strong enough wield two God Arc's. A feat that normally result in the death and transformation for the God Eater into a Aragami.
Mid game you were promoted to team leader and held the rank of lieutenant.

In GE 2 you start as a Vice-captain of the Special Forces Blood. A special force that only recruits those that surpass the even strongest of new-types. You are the second person the ever develop a Blood Art and the Power of Blood: Evoke.
Later on you are promoted to the rank of captain of the Blood squad. Your ability lets other blood members develop their ability faster and non-blood member can fight aragami that deactivate God Arc's. The reason they can fight, is because you just exist. You give direction and bring leadership

In GE 3 you are an AGE. A God Eater that surpass all God Eaters that came before without even trying. The game stats that even the weakest of them are 50% aragami themselves. You have an exceptional high Resonance even for a AGE, your strength and endurance is unmatched by even some aragami's. No person or aragami pose a threat compare to your might (Story wise, gameplay wise you are killable nor can you punch a aragami to the death)
But you have a flaw. You character has little to barely any motivation besides 'Protect my station'. You were born a slave and hold the title of Devil of the Chrysanthemum. You are the brawn of the team, you are a beast on the battlefield but remain to background when plans are devised.

Here comes the secondary main character: Hugo. An AGE that so far as we know, is a childhood friend maybe even since birth. Although he is above your general AGE he is much weaker that you. But he acts as the brain of the team. Plotting plans, making deals,  looking for ways to escape, supports his team, reports to higher ups,....

[h1]Negative points 	[/h1]

1. Blast Gun got replaced by the Ray Gun because it was overpowered. Downgrading is a concept that exist. We could had have 5 different gun types.

2. Custom bullets are downgraded. they cost ammunition which there is a limited of. Only 4 self-made bullets are allowed to take with you. Regular bullets are put above creativity.

3. Aragami are significantly weakened. Most battles ranges from 3 to 5 minutes. Just are example. A mission against both Caligula and Marduk was 6 min, Kyuubi was 3 min and a Chrome Gawain was 4 min. (For ref: I used weapons of one rank below and a shield of rank two for all of them.) Two of them are flagship monster and the other ones are high end aragami. I hated the short time in the Kyuubi fight, I love his weapons since GE2. The amount of time I devoted to defeat Kyuubi and later on Magatsu Kyuubi is insane. Here I got upgraded version almost in the same half hour(both blade and gun).

4. Sadly they remove around 70 aragami! (included variants)

5. Skills/abandoned God arc's are immensely downgrade. Just to name a few: Survival Instinct,Coward, God of Rare Drops, Hidden Attack,All Out Attack, JGHP Recovery, Sluggish, Dual Link-Burst, Out of Shape  and many more aren't present.  	   

6. 10 hairstyles and clothing. Yes hair has physics and almost every clothing has 2 or 4 recolors or one with more tape. But when hair clips and it is still 10 clothing options it isn't really that special.
GE 2 not Rage Burst, just GE 2 had 30 hairstyles on the start and 67 clothing items, not counting recolors. Meaning people had 4489 options of outfits, again not counting recolors.

7. No character episodes or real character development. Non of those people have any substantial character worth. You might like them, that's fine and I can't prove it isn't possible. I even like Hugo even though we know little about him. The reason I think for their lack of character is because they hardly have any flaws. Eg  Zeke is the class clown just like Kota and Kota/Romeo/Nana. But Kota had that attitude because he also hated seeing his mother and sister cry. He was naive. Romeo and Nana had the same idea. Both were naive and didn't always wanted to face the truth. Those 3 overcame that and matured. Zeke is an idiot, yes he try's to keep high spirits but never faces a personal problem because of his action. He lost his brother but once he found him, he hardly said a word to him. Why?

8. Last but not least, the story: It is abysmal. No action makes sense. Who are we fighting? Normal aragami are neglected, Ash ones aren't threatening and most problems are fix the next mission. 'We will escaped the prison' 6 tut's later and we are free, 'we will take our loli back' bad guy didn't even had time to go 5 feet without losing her.
All threats are to your party are illogical. I think the most stupidest sentence comes from Zeke. When you lose your loli, he says ""Can't believe people can be so selfish.....""
To give context the 'loli' can save 500 lives. Yes, doom the lives of 500 AGE's while 1 live can save 500 and cleans the ash in the most advanced facility the world currently has. They give you a story and say it is black and white, while it is clearly a grey matter.
Does not matter since the game pulls a deus ex machina and the end anyway.",1550270312,1558258177,False,11,0,0.49538952112197876,0,True,False,False

1. This game is region locked for multiplayer it has been an issue since the god eater 2 and res because they don't run their own independent servers the use steams servers which are region locked.
2. This game is basically monster hunter with an actual story and characters you don't hate but if you aren't up for grinding for gear this game isn't for you.
3. God eater 2's story and characters were better and the amount of content is very limited on 3 since it has no dlc or extra character stories like in 2. (i'm not saying they should make a payed dlc for the game to make it longer or better they should have spent more time on the story to begin with)
All of that being said the game is still fun and though i played it for nearly 60 hours the week it came out playing all the side missions grinding all the materials i needed for weapons didn't feel as bad as in other games which required too much grinding this game is much more streamlined to be able to experience the story faster and though some of the story is only ok at times i had a genuinely good time up till the after story which kinda boiled down to 3 missions then a long form mission with no rest between 2-3 tough enemies only to have to do another one which made you fight all the ashborn in a row sometimes 2 at a time but it wasn't much of a challenge at that point. I may be seeming to come off negative but the game and characters were fun to play and just be in their world. The new weapons and the removal of the broken blood rage ability from 2 made the game more enjoyable in the long run and once more content comes out be it in dlc or free update form i will be playing it again and then I will update my feelings on the game because as it stands it is a good game being held back from being a great game by it's region lock on multiplayer and story that doesn't feel complete yet though god eater 2 rage burst is a better game storywise it wasn't the first form of 2 and 2 when it released had a lot of the same issues though the region lock wasn't fixed the story was and i have to say i played it twice because of the story once on ps4 and once on pc this game franchise is great and i feel this one was held back by a team short on time or rushed writers. I do fully recommend this game to people who like monster hunter but want characters in the game to behave like you know humans instead of blank stone slates. That's all i have to say about the game it's good but not great like the others but it's also not a waste of time the story is good, the characters are believable, and the game play is nice tight and responsive.",1557838284,1557838284,True,6,0,0.580830156803131104,11,True,False,False

love the story and love my Avatar they actually fell like part of the group and not just stuck on even though they dont talk the  eyes and body movement say alot (have no idea about the mouth cause my characters lower face is covered)
played with most of the weapon types until i stuck with scythes cause of the reach which is great cause i have a habit of missing cause i overestimate my reach and miss like an idiot.

the maps look great and really give the feel of a ravaged world without making everything look grey and bland though it could use more maps to traverse or atleast make it bigger like stage wise cause even though it will add a new ones as you get further you will be seeing the ones you have before all the time even though your on the other end of europe like how many frozen bases are there also i should probably play through the first two games so i can learn more about these areas cause i feel like theres some spoilers in one of the maps that has some importance.

i could go on but i wont cause its late and im sure there are people who have already made comments that tell it better then me so ill just end with this game is awsome and i recommend playing with a controller cause its a pain to play with a keyboard and mouse.",1557817634,1557817634,True,1,0,0.518490016460418701,0,True,False,False

The aesthetic wasn’t to my tastes and the story was fairly bland in my opinion; at the very least it didn’t have a satisfying hook that made me want to stick around.  The ability to demolish massive beasts with heavy weaponry wasn’t satisfying enough without the initial rush of actually fighting something that felt dangerous.

God Eater 3 gave me that rush.  Having never played any previous games, the tone was instantly set as a bleak world on the brink of destruction.  These creatures were described as incredibly deadly, and only a certain type of person even had a chance of combating them.  In the very first mission, you’re tasked with rescuing a fellow “AGE” whose squadron was decimated by these creatures.  Despite being relatively easy to dispatch of as a player, it gives you the feeling that you and your friends are particularly skilled in slaying these beasts.

My only complaints are that the tutorial at the start is fairly lackluster, and the situations don’t change to better train some very useful systems such as lock-on and the shield.  It wasn’t until facing the first “super boss” that I was forced to learn the shield.

The animations for talking is also a bit janky; sometimes mouths will just gape in the middle of a conversations if the characters are talking to fast.  They have no lip animations; talking is just the opening and closing of mouths.

Otherwise I find combat very satisfying.  It’s not as heavy and methodical as the MH series, but for the style it has; that just wouldn’t work.  In an anime-esque world, you want anime-esque fights.  That means loud, fast, and flashy.  The game definitely delivers in that area.  My favorite weapon is the heavy moon because while it is definitely fast and flashy, using the chainsaw scythe on a stationary enemy is incredibly powerful and satisfying.

This game isn’t for everyone.  Just like how I couldn’t get into the MH series, some people won’t be able to get into this game.  Despite being a hunter game, it’s varied enough to be considered different and able to stand its own two feet.  Personally, I have a large satisfaction from this game that MH wasn’t able to give me.",1557298072,1557298072,True,3,0,0.478926807641983032,0,True,False,False

GE3 will leave you poor and hungry.  GE3 the appearence of Phym, an evolved ARAGAMI in human form  does solve the problem of loosing your HP  when you are in battle which is far better than NANA BURST in GE2. The story line is good with a volumptuous lady HILDA, trying to survive the ASHLAND, ASH ARAGAMI is more powerful than usual ARAGAMI. Attacks have really evolved from ground to air to step, dresses have evolved with brighter colour and fine texture, old ARAGAMI like VAJRA has evolved while YAKSHA, RAVANNA are missing from the gameplay.

For context, I've played GE from Burst and I played both Resurrection and Rage Bust on Steam as well. I'll be comparing GE3 to those two as I go along this review. 

[h1]So let's start with the positives.[/h1]
+ [b]The gameplay/combat is fun.[/b] Even though some enemies like Havakiri are annoying, fighting-wise it's fun. I reached 130 hours purely off of just fighting stuff.
+ The 2 new weapons are fun and unique enough from the current sets that it doesn't feel like a redundant add-in. I main the short sword and can easily enough enjoy the Moon even if I had to switch playstyles.
+ Burst Art Effects are cool.
+ [b]There are a lot of possibilities for expansion.[/b] Just looking at the map, they could add a lot more content in the future.
+ The voice-acting (I was running on JP voices) is always a plus.
+ The graphics quality gives me a lot of Berseria/Zestiria vibes which is pretty good.
+ It doesn't follow the expected plot-twists.

[h1]THAT SAID, I do have a lot of issues.[/h1]
- For one, [b]the story felt like the worst out of all 3 mothership games.[/b] GE1 was the typical save the world story and GE2 was rather predictable but at least in those games, I felt like my character had a stake. Each character arc had some urgency and I could feel the tension around the base as the story progressed. In GE3, [u] I feel like you could replace protag with a stick with special powers and everything would stay the same[/u]. Sure, Hound 1 had some cool, badass moments but other than that, I felt like the main character was actually HUGO. All protag did was nod.

- WHICH would have been fine if they developed all the other side characters much much more. Lulu's arc, Zeke's arc- they all felt shallow and resolved in 3 story missions. In GE 1, Alisa not being there or Sakuya's struggles felt real. In GE2, Romeo's issues felt like they had more connection. In GE3, even Phym's story felt disconnected. To think that they already had pretty solid references in the previous 2 games. I loved GE for the stories they had but GE3 really felt flat, rushed, and underutilized.

- There is a lot of camera clipping.
- Where did all my lobby actions go? Why do I only have 8 now?
- The costume availability is sad. This is easily solved by new releases but still.
- Chat is hard to access
- Multi-stage missions feel meh. You can't switch loadouts anymore which kinda render them useless. And you end up just bring a common element or a non-elemental. I feel like the old campaigns felt much more tactical and flexible.

[b]Things I wish they would do in the future:[/b]
= God, give us more costumes/hair
= Let us change eye colors!!!!!
= LOBBY ACTIONS
= Character episodes and/or GE1/GE2 tie-ups
= More weapons, hopefully. 
= The floor where Phym was/MedBay/GodArc Storage Vault gives me hope that there's new stuff that could happen there but it feels like useless space right now.
= More areas/bases. In GE2, we were able to switch from the 1st base to Far East's/GE1's base. I hope they would give use more bases to explore in the future.

[h1]TLDR; Buy this game if you want a fun, monster hunting game that is, if you're new to the franchise, or don't care about the story even in the past. If you do care about the story, buy it because it's fun gameplay-wise but prepare to be disappointed.[/h1]",1556936592,1556936919,True,51,0,0.806381404399871826,0,True,False,False

My general thoughts can be broken down into these points:
* The gameplay system is a flat upgrade across the board from God Eater 2.
* The netcode is solid, I had no connection issues while playing the game with my friends. 
* The story feels directionless at times, meandering from one plot point to another. It's finale doesn't feel that well earned.
* The characters are inconsistent. About 4 of the main characters are really well developed, two where complete ripoffs of prior characters, and the rest where one dimensional and would be forgettable if not for their appearance.
* The biggest disappointment of the game was the costume variety. There is maybe only 10-12 outfits (for the girls), and they pad out the selection by offering 2 variants of each costume set, and only 4 colors for each variant. This might be fixed when they release the 2nd Arc, but as of right now the selection is sub-par.

In the end, I enjoyed the game greatly, and i'd give it about an 7/10. Can't wait for the Free DLC down the line.",1556606896,1556606896,True,3,0,0.52867501974105835,0,True,False,False

Graphics & Performance:
Well, it might not be the triple A, over the top, realistic graphics some people seemed to expect, this game is damn pretty.  Overboarding effects, smooth lighting, acceptable textures. i really enjoyed wandering the areas (even if there are relatively few of them, but you know that from the series) which are nicely detailed and having tremendously more hight-differences than the flat planes from GE2. Also, the performance-optimization is pretty nice, as i can play this on my Laptop with an 840m currently not having access to my Desktop-PC.

Gameplay:
This might be the most important one. And the biggest comparison to GE2: GE3 is GE2 on speed. They completely changed the movement to a more fast-paced fighting with a new Air dash, less stamina cost for the shotguns dash, blazingly fast weapons like the biting edge and nice ways to include the Blood-Arts from GE2 as Burst arts, making Burst finally really important. I enjoyed the hell out of this gameplay. It makes GE2 appear slow.
They also seem to have increased the difficulty since GE2 as i find myself incapacitated more often, but this could be due to the absence of Kanon Daiba healing me from the brink of death with her healing-laser across the map. Claire does it sometimes, but not as reliable and frequent, leaving me to play a bit more self-preserving. And despite some enemys having an attack pattern so fast that its hard to close up and easy to get pinned (looking at you havakirii) the publisher already said they will adress that in the next patch.

Characters & Details:
The character models look gorgeous. There are less hairstyles for the Player character and most pieces of clothing are Military-stile and variants of each other, you can individualize your character a nice bit. (Already to be adressed in net content patch)
The companions are designed nicely and each one fills a niche in fighting, their characters are a bit underdeveloped in the first half of the game. I hope this is adressed in the additional story missions to come or maybe we see are return of Character episodes. But do you really need more companions than phym?
Also, there are some pretty nice details in the game. Like the cat on your base, always sleeping in a different spot, making me search for it between missions, or phym mimiking you gestures, making me greet her whenever i board my ship and getting greeted back.

Story:
it has some pacing issues, and is just ramping up near the end, but is has some nice aspects and is really good in making me understand the underlying motives of each and every character. Also, phym is the first ""little girl""- companion that i dont find annoying. 

Content:
This has about as much content as GE1 and GE2 on first release (Not Burst/Ressurrection or Rage burst). And with the promise of free updates i can live with that. Also, its fun to slay aragami again for loot to make better weapons. Currently going for 100% of achivements. For the 35€ i paid on steam, 40+ Hours (as i said: with more to come) is absolutely okay.

tl:dr:
+nice graphics
+free content to come
+absolutely addicting fast-paced gameplay
+nice characters
+Nice story when it ramps up speed

o some balancing problems with enemys (to be adressed)
o less customization-options (to be adressed)

Graphics look really great, compared to GE2RB, gameplay is smooth and combat is fluid.

However story is a little too linear. Villains are quickly recognizable and story is quite short compared to previous game.

But new roster of characters feels fresh for the series and game shows potencial to evolve into even better experience.
This new characters are amazing, but not much is known about them (exept ClaIre and Lulu), so it would be nice to have some character episodes for them, maybe what they did after becoming god eaters and before game actually starts.

About combat, gameplay is smooth and they finally separated Lock on and Dash functions(in GE2RB there was 1 button). New Dive function is very convenient as during exploration as during combat and is very fun to use especially during ash aragami fights. And it's great to be able to use blood arts for ground, aerial and step attacks. 

Speaking of aragami, it's nice to see familiar faces, such as hanibal, caligula, chi-you, etc. New aragamis are quite fun to fight especially Ash aragami(and their Devour attacks).

For protagonist it's classic male/female selection, customizing is nice, but lack of fashion clothes is troubling(nothing that can't be fixed with updates). It's also nice to see some physics applied to protagonists hair and clothes. 
And        I don't know if it's spoiler or not or just a surprise [spoiler] Protagonist actually speaks at the end of story, and not just 2 sentences as in GE2RB. [/SPOILER]

Also being a fan of the Monster Hunter Series ever since they launched on PS2, is relevant to this review.

God Eater 3 brings alot of positives, which for me, as a fan, justify the full price.
those Positives are:
-Improved Visuals and Animations
-New Monsters and new Weapons 
-Fluid, Smooth Gameplay that feels better compared to the previous God Eater games
-Japanese Dub available to use for the game

having liked the previous games, these additional positives made it easy for me to decide to purchase God Eater 3.

the relevancy of Monster Hunter comes into play for the following reason:
Some claim that God Eater 3 is trying to be a copy of Monster Hunter World.
this is nonsese for various reasons.
God Eater has entirely different gameplay, unlocking skills and learning new moves, switching your melee weapon to a gun for bursts, eating up an Aragami to power yourself up, are only a few significant differences to name here.
The Story is also playing out entirely different compared to Monster Hunter.
i mean those who've played Monster Hunter will know that the game barely has a story, even World was extremely barebones in that term.

i rate this game highly, i'm glad i bought it, and i don't regret paying the full price.
if you're a fan of the God Eater games, you can purchase this without worries.

however, if you are new to God Eater, you may want to wait for a sale before giving it a try.

i appreciate this and Monster Hunter both very much.

First of all the movements and camera controls really weird, idk maybe its just me who isnt used to it, but no game ive ever played has such weird controls, and its not just the awkward control scheme, its also just it feels off. Your attacks also dont really feel like they have any weight to them which I found unsatisfying.

If you came to this game because you liked MHW and ran out of things to do, then I would suggest avoiding this game since thats what I did, and this game is not what I was looking for or expected it to be. Or give it a try but dont play it for too long so you can still refund it if you dont end up liking it. The controls and combat feels completely different from MHW (which isnt the games fault, since its not the same game) but if you came here form MHW youll find it awkward and hard to get used to.

The art style is basically just anime, up or down is your choice, if you like anime (like me) then its a good thing, if you dont then maybe avoid this game, since its seriously heavily anime (if you cant tell xD).

The design of the aragami are pretty cool, if a bit over the top. The weapon designs are also pretty over the top, but again, not bad, I quite liked it.

The game starts off really slowly paced which is kinda annoying, it takes quite a few hours before youre actually fighting anything cool or worthwhile.

The overall combat of the game isnt bad perse, but as mentioned earlier, the bad controls kinda fucked with my experience of it.

The story is decent basically, nothing outstanding, but good enough to keep your attention. Its also fairly long.

The character customization is really lackluster , you get very few choices. You get like 10 hairstyles and 10 faces to choose from or some similar number, then you get 2 accesory slots to add random stuff like glasses or scars or bandages or eyepatches etc. You can basically make your hair any colour tho.",1555170424,1555170424,False,12,4,0.510067105293273926,0,True,False,False

The game loses most of its continuity with GE1 and 2 because of its different region. However, its still a GE game with the same emphasis on the struggle to survive in the hellish world overrun with aragami.

There are new weapons and slightly reworked abilities for existing weapon types, so its a fresh injection of gameplay mechanics for returning players. However, sadly they did not bring back Predator Styles from GE1Remastered. There are new gameplay elements that encourage paired-play like resonance, so its also forming ludonarrative reasoning to work with a specific partner to share resonance abilities. Alongside triggers that are specific requirements that need to be fulfilled during missions that activate certain battle bonuses, there is a lot to juggle with in battle.

Reaching burst 3 is surprisingly easier in the current game. Your AI partners know to instinctively burst link AND keep tabs on your remaining burst gauge. Resonance automatically shares the burst gauge meaning you can reach burst 3 by linking and then giving your aragami bullets to the linked player. All of this drastically improves the gameplay flow and helps to limit the time needed to juggle devouring to maintain the burst levels. Overall battle seems more fun and less like a chore of multitasking, and with the new aragami and movesets it makes combat more intense. Mix in new bosses and their ability to both rage AND devour into their ""Burst"" mode and things can get pretty frantic.

Theres sadly less customization options in GE3 compared to both GE1&2. So fashion GEs will be feeling kinda down about the limited clothing options. Same goes for bullets, which are ridiculously dumbed down. Not only are bullets limited in modules, but you are limit to 1000 Oracle points for custom bullets. Meaning you dont replenish OP for custom bullets and are limited to a set number of them. They also took out most of the bullet scaling meaning fights are exclusively won by melee. The only real damage done by guns is the new ""ray gun"" that works like the old blast gun, where rather than firing intermittently you just charge up your Oracle Reserves before just ray gunning away like a sc2 Void Ray with prismatic core.

However, the new focus on melee weapons also brings up the new weapon arts that serve to augment your fighting style. The upgrades are kinda obscure so it requires several tries to intentionally unlock the one you like, not to mention there are other hidden requirements that have to be met. All together this makes unlocking weapon arts kind of a chore for late game optimization, but its nothing major that stops you from completing the game. The difficulty is also easier, so returning players expect to SSS nearly every mission you come by.

There are less options now for skill customization, so builds are pretty limited now in late game. But it does make it easier to find better God Arc parts to boost the skills you want. Multiplayer is a joy to play if you just want to wreck shit together, and you can finally complete story quests together!

GE3 has at least 40 hours worth of good content, and its expected to increase because they are only at the rank 7 weapon limit where most GE games have up to rank 10. Overall this GE installment really was the one we were looking forward to. Sadly they didn't add in GE PvP but the PvE elements still make it helluva enjoyable despite the emphasis on melee. Story wise its probably the best, building on the same themes of GE1 and Paylor Sakaki's Singularity. The timeskip also reveals the likely direction the storyline is heading towards, and most GE fans will understand what this entails for likely future installments.

So GEs, its time to inject yourself with a new bias factor, get a brand spanking new bracelet, and swear loyalty to another Fenrir related branch to carve out humanity's place in the world. RESONANCE ACTIVATE! Begin the hunt.",1554802725,1554802725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Much faster gameplay, more dangerous and aggresive enemies than in previous entries makes game much more satisfying. Controls are much smoother, especially after latest patch - charging lance feels much faster now, devouring animation is also speed up to match current speed of game. Three new weapons, each with unique mechanics (2 melee, 1 ranged), GE2 blood arts are now much more powerful and moved into burst arts, also few new features added to encourage team play. 

I had quite a few troubles with running game (random crashed before cutscenes or in loading screens), however seems like those problems are either sorted out, or solutions are ready and tested (and posted on forums), but that aside - game performance is really good. Character and Aragami models look detailed, but envinroment is in lower resolution, stinging in eyes during cutscenes, where you have GE:R resolution textures of buildings/floors/walls with superior new character models :)

Along with quite decent english VA (compared to GE:R and GE2 english VA is much, much better, but still fails at some occasions), we now get original japanese VA! Although some rants between team members aren't translated to english sub (like at beginning of fight), japanese is more emotional and more pleasant to ears, since they match the action and story very well.

Players that played and didn't enjoy previous God Eater games may want to give the series another try with God Eater 3.

The biggest change may be the shift in focus from guns to melee.
In the previous games, guns and bullets made it possible to kill Aragami while being completely out of their attack range the entire fight. While ranged attacks are still quite useful in GE3, their role is more of a temporary burst of damage. Veterans may notice that this game instead relies around melee weapons, and learning the Aragami's attack patterns to dodge and keep landing as many close-ranged hits as possible.

The previous games also required players to complete side story quests with the main characters to unlock certain features, a notable example being befriending Ciel in GE2 to unlock Blood Bullets. This was not carried over in GE3, and the majority of the game (aside from certain weapons and accessories) can be unlocked by simply progressing the main story. However, this also removed all of the side story content that helped you to get to know the characters better.

Possible deal breakers:

Multiplayer has been improved in this game, but is not quite all there yet.
The game doesn't have an in-game chat, and players will have to communicate through Steam or other means.

Players will need to select the same Download Region in the Steam client in order to play with each other.

[h1]Story[/h1]
As new threats arise, so does new breed of God Eaters - enslaved from childhood and forced to fight as expendable tools when they come of AGE. The ash storm phenomenon replaces the red rain, AGEs replace the Blood unit, and Phym replaces Shio. The devouring apocalypse is now a thing of the past, say hello to the ash tempest. New characters fill in the position of the stereotypes from GER and GE2RB; Lindow is reincarnated in the form of Hugo, Zeke subs for Romeo and Kota, Claire effectively replaces Alisa and Ciel, there's the one eyed Soma Ein, while Hilda outsizes Leah and Tsubaki's forefronts altogether. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The core combat is still intact and is seemingly a lot faster, but falls behind GE Resurrection and GE2 Rage Burst. GER had the predator system which makes entering the go to ""burst mode"" fun and innovative, while GE2RB had blood arts which adds different effects to your weapon's abilities without going into burst. In GE3 however, all the good stuff - Burst Arts, Plugins and even some of the more basic skills like Rapid Charge is now tucked behind the burst mode.

[b]-[/b]The skill sets to choose from has been dumbed-down, and if that wasn't enough, building skills is as consistent as your RNG.

[b]-[/b]Leveling and unlocking skills (acceleration triggers and burst arts) is still tedious.

[b]-[/b]Assault missions are fun when teamed up with actual players, but the 5 minute limit doesn't really work when fighting alongside bots.

[b]-[/b]Aragami of effect one too many. Almost every type of Aragami you fight has 1 or 2 variations of AOE attacks. 

[b]-[/b]Swarms of tanky adds gives boss battles a cheap F2P MMO feel and ruins the fun of solo play. Dual boss encounters is far too chaotic for an effective solo play.

[b]-[/b]Clunky way of progressing the story where you have to look for the right NPC with a dialogue bubble.

[b]-[/b]Character creation and customization is very bland, and most outfits are lazily recycled up to 12 times with very minor changes.

[b]-[/b]No option to rotate the minimap.


[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Its not a port so the graphics has improved whether you're looking at the characters or the Aragamis. The environments, not so much, and you'll still see low quality textures here and there.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
God Eater 3 is an ok game on its own, but being the 3rd installment following the bang for the buck package of God Eater Resurrection which is good, and God Eater 2 Rage Burst which was incrementally better, it's only natural for you to expect the latest to be the greatest. Unfortunately that is not the case here. The story is cheesy like before, graphics has improved, and I find the soundtrack a bit more appealing, BUT the gameplay which is supposed to keep you engaged long after the story ends just feels like a downgrade overall.  
This was one of my highly anticipated games of 2018 and I came here with high expectations having played GER and GE2RB and learning that the release is delayed to 2019. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed with the final product. With the likes of MHW and Dauntless or even the God Eater 1&2 combo out there, it's hard to recommend this game.

[h1]Edit[/h1]
Patch 1.2 added 60 certification missions, and the devs felt that you have to be reminded twice with annoying prompts each time you progress to the next one which is absolutely retarded, much like what this game has turned out to be...",1551878127,1553176942,False,3,0,0.455332964658737183,0,True,False,False

I say ""monster hunting game"" because the gameplay loop is exactly that.
Sadly most of the contents it has to offer is adequate to almost good.
Some may say its a scam for its price. Let's go over the details.

Lightning fast gameplay is both a blessing and a curse.
Monsters ""telegraph"" its move in small amount of frames the players could missed it.
Some monsters even have a move that just ... happens without telegraphing.
Players will resort on ""Act first ask questions later"" and find themselves going through most fight by simply slotting in most possible DPS into whatever opening they have, this department is where the comments about the game doesn't have any tactical aspect to the gameplay rises.
Average fight time last about 3-5 minutes or lower, the dragged one last about 5-10 minutes.
Because of this most players are expected to finished the whole thing about 4-6 hours or lower if they have no interests in making new weapons of the other tech tree.
Even if they do they will get their items in matter of an hour or lower.

You may notice the amount of ""lower"" time estimation.
Which sums up the curse of this lightning paced gameplay loop of the game.
It cuts out the overall playtime of the game for the player to digest its content.

The world established itself quite well.
Explaining why exactly the player has to operate in a small area for a short amount of time.
Sadly most of it explains through text via database with little to no player interaction to it.

Story....You are the chosen one kind of story.... let's just say its fine.

Multiplayer is ....adequate.
""Assault"" is the only mode most player will find smooth experience with less technical issues.
Main story Multiplayer however is another story, any party member leaving the session will force everybody else into loading screen transit to singleplayer mode altogether.
So in the middle of the session or the fight if some member got disconnected other members will get forced out in an instant as well. 
This is assuming you can get the multiplayer working as there's not much players around.

To get more enjoyment out of this game you may have to limit A.I. party members to 1 at the most or solo the mission out because these companions don't mess around they're so good to the point they could possibly replace some human players even if they have weird things going through their head sometimes. Some may say its possible to go through the whole missions without the player's interaction at all THAT is last thing any player want.

Despite all these short coming I still recommend this game especially when its on discount.
All because it ticks out all the stuff I wanted, Anime aesthetic fast monster hunting gameplay.",1550423926,1553164066,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

First things first. The game looks and plays like a dream. The overall visual quality of the game is lightyears ahead of the previous installments. The gameplay is well constructed, although I still would like the dash/sidestep to be a Dark Souls- like dodge (Aka invulnerable during the action, even at the cost of making enemy attacks deal more damage) and even though I miss some features from the older games, mostly GERB2, such as Blood Bullets and the ""make missions harder with better loot"", this one comes on top with the devour feature of the ""main boss"" Aragamies.

The added bullet creation feature is as a concept a fantastic idea, but has very little practical use. Due to the very limited amount of bullets you can take with you it is hard to construct and use any other type of bullets than mass-heals (imo atleast). The new weapon types are well constructed and balanced but personally of the new ones I prefer the dual-daggers.

The story is well written and much darker than the previous installments, which I love. It is also nive to see that the story is tied to the prevous games, even though only at the end and through only one character: [spoiler] Ein = Soma [/spoiler].

Now to the negatives...

The story, while well written is very short. Compared to the 15 difficulty levels, and all with story of GERB2 this on only has [spoiler] 7 [/spoiler] and the last one doesn't even have that much story in it.

There are very few weapons/shields. Considering the fact that there are two new melee weapons and one new gun (although the gun replaces one old) there is no reason to have as many or worse, even less different weapons than the older games. Atleast the weapons there are have some unique advantages and disadvantages to them.

There are very little outfits. This may not be a big deal for most since it has no impact on the gameplay but personally I have set a goal to myself that in every game where there there are outfit options, I will get them all. It just doesn't feel as rewarding when there are 5 outfits and those all have 5 variants. They all look nice though.

The enemies in this game... They are nice, but there are way too few different ones. There was no need to get rid of the ""fallen"" variants of nearly every enemy. Also some enemies have just been made easier, such as the Dyaus Pita and Chrome Gawain. 

The game is a lot easier than the previous ones. I still remeber my first battle against the first Varja back in GERB1 and how it was like the most intimidating and strong foe there was. And even in the late game it posed a threath due to the higher overall difficulty of the game. This game on the other hand has a viable strategy of *cough* ehem *cough* ""balls-deep"". I would love to see the enemies require some strategic planning for the player to come on top.

The ally NPCs still don't know how a healer should act like -.- .

In short.

The game looks great and plays great, but for veteran GE-players such as myself there is quite lot of missed potential here. I hope they will add more content and it doesn't even have to be story based. Just add more weapons and weapon upgrades, some new enemies and up the difficulty of them to 11.",1553034107,1553034379,True,3,0,0.53061223030090332,0,True,False,False

I'll try avoid spoiler but I must say it's rather breathtaking for Eastern Europe, the maps are a mix of small and large. More aragami (monsters) [spoiler] but they did cut-down on the variants of the aragami [/spoiler]. Some of the previous aragami has returned (some with their GOOD old set of move sets) to mix with the batch of new Aragami and so once more you take the role of a God Eater with character customization with 3 new God Arcs in the pool (Biting Edge, Heavy Moon & Raygun) fighting for salvation in the wastelands.

Music: 9 (Love it)
Gameplay/Combat: 8 (tweaks are on its way for combat)
Story: 7.5 (There's more to be improved here)
Multiplayer: Available (4 people / team & Assault Mission 8 people / 1 team) [improvements underway]
Overall: 8.2

Spoilers ahead you have been warned


Music wise it's amazing as always, it could either strike fear in you or panic or just motivates you to go into the ashlands and fight all the aragami with your god arc [spoiler](just don't go brandishing it blindly as you don't want to get blown up by some) [/spoiler]. Music often engages you with the emotions in the story and gives you that feeling of nostalgia, joy, sadness etc.

Story wise it is good but still can improve further. The focus of the story was mostly on the protagonist (you the player) and your best pal, Hugo. It gives you that feeling of hope despite the face of despair and as the story progresses, more characters joins your team adding more flavor to the story. [spoiler] However this is where it falls short, the lack of character development for the other side characters which are actually well developed side characters just that there is more they could tell you but the plot wasn't meant for them leaving that sense that you wish to know them better [/spoiler]

Combat has changed significantly, as players are given more options to customize their melee god arcs special move sets which allows the player to make their own personalized style of fighting. Custom bullets were now reduced to quite minor in the combat as you can make those super awesome bullets but you can only carry lesser due to their cost BUT these custom bullets can now be used on any ranged weapon (what a twist). Aragami's now have DEVOUR mechanics similar to what you God Eaters do chomping them to enter Burst now they too can do the same to you [spoiler] limited to certain Ashland Aragami [/spoiler], revenge is sweet

Round of applause to God Eater 3 for introducing the 8 player Assault Mission, a huge step up from the previous 2 games. Assault missions are fun to play with as you can crossplay with people from various servers (stated in various sources, not sure how true).  Team up with online players or play offline with AIs (AIs are not too shabby this time) and hunt those Ash Aragami for a limited time. It gives it a sense of urgency and the need to cooperate with fellow players / AIs to get the job done or at least do something to it. The only limitation now is that you can't bring your multiplayer team to join for assault missions (Coming soon in next update password protected assault mission maybe then we'll see it)

Overall I love the game, it's fun to play with friends and it does get grindy for mats and skills. The story is enjoyable but lacks depth in some areas.

For big fans of Monster Hunter World, though,  you may find the difference a bit jarring as the combat system is not quite as tuned as Monster Hunter, but still fun. For people who have tried the past GE titles, this game is much better from a modernized perspective. The old games truly felt like handheld ports while this game actually feels like a PC/Console game. I felt it was worth the time and money and will likely come back to it later as they add more content (which I believe is expected to be free content). 

When I bought the game I really thought I wouldn't get as much play time out of it as I did and there is still some more content I could run through. The weapon systems are relatively in-depth and each weapon (though I've only played 3 of them) feels unique in it's own way and has a bit of a different playstyle.

The only downside for me is that once you optimize a build, the combat does feel a bit 'spammy' and more like a button masher than games like MH which sometimes takes a bit more precise input. Additionally, the game is less about exploration and ""Hunting"" and is much better described as an action combat title, which is much faster-paced than other similar games.

While Monster hunter has more interesting weapons and a more distinguishable difference between them in playstyle, I largely view enemies in this series as being more interesting. Some enemies have phases, with new attack patterns or have certain conditions that make this much more powerful or tricky to fight. God Eater is however easier in general, with most missions against actual targets being less than 10 minutes with little to no deaths.

Have to say, I loved it in the end.

I played GER and GE2RB, one of which I played through twice and completed trophies. Also played all the predecessors to the series including the mobile ones, but in all honesty, GE3 has surpassed my expectations as to how far it can be fun.
Having played GEO and GE Resonant OPS, I was kind of afraid GE3 would be similar, but it was more than its predecessors.

Story is a bit short, but GE series has always ALWAYS given free additional members to take along, free additional stories, and many other freebies.
So, I would not put that into account in terms of rating this game. Who doesn't love freebies to munch on? (Plus they already announced in their blog that they would add first batch of additional stories in spring of 2019)

Liked the game mechanics, Having played GEB, I am not too annoyed by havakiri, it's not that bad compared to Pita from back in the days. But I hated Ra. No, Ra, just, no.

So far the only systematic problem I have is the system language. 
Please let me play in Japanese even with an English-default PC... (feel free to comment and let me know where I can change, in case I am just blind and skipped the setting.)
Awesome that we could switch between JPN VA and ENG VA.
It would be nice to have ""Save import"" back again, so we could customize our MC or FMC at anytime without starting the entire game over.

Now a bit into my early playing experience.
I am using Mouse and Keyboard, which I could see many have said ""It sucks you should use a controller instead.""
I actually had to put away the game after 30 minutes of game play, due to the terrible mouse sensitivity, but I have to say after turning all of the sensitivity settings to almost maximum, tweaking around with my graphics board, it improved tremendously and was rather comfortable to play.
To some new-comers, I think they would feel more ""weight"" in looking around, but GE series has always been this way, so I think it's not the problem of calibration in the end.
Conclusion: with the right settings, the game should work as it was intended to.

Having played the entire series, I would recommend it to all future players, but if you are planning to play previous games in the series, be aware that you should complete in the order of GER, GE2RB, GE3. 
If you get used to the comfortable gaming system of newer ones, it is almost impossible to return to previous ones, unless you have played PSP predecessors before. 
(For those of you who played PSP predecessors, I'm pretty sure you will have no problem getting used to the GEB kind of controls again. But I have to warn, it will still be painful.)

There were these other reviews that caught my eyes, and I have to comment.
No, MH and GE are not the same, and they are both not copycat of one or the other.
There are so many ""hunting games"", and I find it rather rude to say that they are all the same because they all ""hunt"".

Combat is a lot faster than previous titles which makes the games more fun but quite hard at times because Enemies are also faster and have a lot more aoe attacks.

Englisch dub was ok most of the time.
Why does god eater now have boob jiggle physics?

What bugs me:
Story wasnt fleshed out well, because it sped up too much but still enjoyable. 

Soundtrack was really good but often missused or recycled at some cutscenes which did not fit at all with what was happening in the cutscene.

X box controller mapping was horrible so remap it somehow (i was too retarded to do so) or play with mouse and keyboard where I mastered god eater combat :D

Oh Steam, when will we ever be able to make neutral reviews. See, the game isn't BAD, it's just such a downgrade in regards of the skill system.

Look, first off - it's a hunting game. There's no leveling up per se, you just kill a huge monster, make weapons out of it and kill the next big monster. If you're comfortable with repetition and have played other hunting games like Monster Hunter, Toukiden or Freedom Wars (or, y'know, God Eater 1 or 2) then it's worth your money, no denying that. What grinds my gears is how they gimped the skills.
Every player character has the same basic abilities and access to several different weapons that allow some decent customization on how you want to go about your killing business. Each weapon and shield also comes with a build-in skill and one or more skill slots, so you can make some more specialized changes. Want to focus on shooting? Get OP-related skills (Disclaimer: Oracle Point, not Over-Powered). One specific weapon-kind to your liking? Grab skills that boost their damage. Like passive boosts? Get the ability to enter Burst when a comrade falls (or provide Burst to your comrades when you kick the bucket yourself). So far, so good.
Problem being, every single built-in skill of your equipment is a Burst skill. Which means, they are only active when you're in Burst. Which, in TURN, means you need to use a devour attack on your enemy that has a fairly long animation to go through and can be easily interrupted. Did I mention that Burst runs out in about thirty seconds? You'll spend a good chunk of your fight just trying to get devour attacks in so your skills will actually work. Also your special moves work only in Burst too, but that's an unrelated (if still quite infuriating) issue.
The other big problem with skills in this game is the low amount of skill slots and the level cap of skills. Skills will either a) provide a specific amount of their bonus per level or b) only activate at level 5. For example, the Stamina skill provides 5 stamina (who would have guessed?) per level, up to a maximum of 50 at level 10. On the other hand, if your skill only ACTIVATES at level 5, then your level 4 Wrath of Revenge will do positively nothing. You can, however, use a level 1 WoR in another slot and activate it. Great.
Except your weapons, if you don't specifically go for those with the max slots, will tend to only have 2 or 3 and the skills you obtain cap out at level 5. Remember how I mentioned Stamina works up to level 10 in the previous paragraph? Yeah, you'll have to waste two valuable slots to get that. Now consider that you'll most likely want to have both your Stamina and Health maxxed out - that's four slots you'll have to burn just for your basic parameters, six if you also want the maximum amount of Oracle Points. Considering you'll have twelve at the absolute maximum and on average will more likely have eight or nine that's a huge chunk of precious resources.

In all fairness, despite my huge rant up there the game is still enjoyable, but just...why butcher something that worked so much better in the previous game, where skills were available up to level 10, not to mentioned the combination 2-in-1 (or 3-in-1, heck, I think even 4-in-1) skills? I just had a constant bitter thought in the back of my head along the lines of ""In God Eater 2 this wouldn't have happened because of [add buttload of skills at my disposal here]"". Seriously, if you want to get into the series I STRONGLY recommend picking up GE2 first. If you already have it, then go ahead and get this - though either keep what I said in mind or just wait for a sale if you're patient.",1551194950,1551194950,False,6,2,0.540484070777893066,3,True,False,False

You've got cute girls.
You've got big ass swords.
You've got huge cool monsters.
You've got anime.
You've got a cool story.

You've got big jiggly anime tiddies.

A vast improvement from the terrible, terrible grind fest, and lukewarm story with terrible characters (I'm looking at you Romeo) from God Eater 2 Rage Burst. Granted, it was ported from the vita but the graphics was sub par on PC and if you don't look too closely, GE3 has vastly improved. Blood arts, Burst, are still there and thank god they removed the horrific Rage Burst which is just straight up bad design.

But today, we're not going to talk about anime or tiddies. We're going to talk about how fights have gone back to the old formula of fast paced, action packed, FX filled, jaw clinching, combat with explosions that would make Micheal Bay cream on his puffs. The Engage system fills half the screen as you struggle to combo your big sword over the huge amount of flashing effects from your Burst Art, and your teammates yelling in your ears, and the operator screaming that your BURST IS RUNNING OUT GODDAMIT DO SOMETHING and the big aragami is charging up his attack but you can't see it nor hear it because let's put all the FX overlapping each other because WHY NOT?

Anyways, its monster hunter with big anime tiddies.

Did I mention that God Eater 3 also big anime tiddies? Seriously, they do.

P.S. I'd love to have Hilda scold me and tie me to a pillar, slap my butt and proceed to violate me. But hey, we can't have everything, can we? #HildaNewWaifu #MoveOverAlissa #GetOutKanon #NoNotEvenYouSakuya #MaybeSomaNoHomo",1551174640,1551174640,True,2,7,0.491294592618942261,0,True,False,False

Tape
Fluid, satisfying combat
Music is great
Air devours are back

New upgrades charts to see how to get weapons you want, and tells you what mission you need to complete for the schematic (once mission is unlocked)
Engage makes it much easier to get yourself to full burst
Updates coming promise more content
Phym is lovely

Cons
Story was fine, but not as expansive as previous games. Hoping that the updates will add some more.
OP (gun ammo) doesn't recover in burst like it did in other games :( 
Wish there was more characters to bring with me in solo play
Customization as far as outfits is more limited than before
I wish I could still switch sets of equips on endurance missions

The Burst Art Effects are an unecessary extra in my opinion, but they do help a lot in fight, sometimes even more than Burst Arts themselves.

Story is Meh when compared to previous games, but it´s good by itself.

The new effects make it harder to read the attacks from aragami.

TL:DR not really worth the current price (S$64.90) at the time of this review, maybe at S$40.

No technical issues nor crashes in the 60+ hours I've played so far.

Its a solid game, albeit it can get repetitive due to the grinding, whether for achievements or gear.
End game materials are solely left up to RNG which kinda left a bad taste in my mouth as I wish for a method to be able to trade for an item, like Monster Hunter World's wyvern tickets.

Story is kinda cheesy but that's ok. Not every game nor story needs to have some major plot twist all the time (Sic previous GE games). A good vanilla story from time to time is ok. Sure, you may be the sidekick but you're still the badass of the group.

AI can derp at times (running in circles, happens very rarely) but being able to customise how they behave to a certain extent is great, while still maintaining their personality (with special traits that can't be customised). They are generally able to stay alive as well. 

Multiplayer should opt for a drop-in drop-out system. At the moment you create a room and wait for players, then start the game. Anyone leaving after the room creation will just leave the slot there, with no chance of anyone else joining. This kinda leaves multiplayer a tad undesirable if you want to play with pubs. Playing with friends is fun tho. Assault missions are different as though they are multiplayer, its pretty much a quick raid with 7 other players. Any empty slots after room preparation time ends will be filled with bots.

Aragami wise, I wish they have a different type of difficulty scaling. The aragami just hits harder and has more HP in higher ranks. An improvement to this would be having additional movesets in higher rank to keep things fresh. At the current stage they still do pose a challenge tho.

Quite a short game if I was able to complete all missions and achievements in 60 hours. Could do with more content, but I heard that's promised in the future.

[h1] Overall Gameplay [/h1]
So the combat of GE3 is pretty good. To me, and most everyone who is reading this review, this should be the main seller of the game. Combat is fast, fluid, highly customizable, and there is plenty of variety in enemies to defeat and weapons to build. However, it does get repetitive at a point. While I am used to this (due to the God Eater series being that of a grindy arcade-style monster hunter game), this will be a turn off to people who find no point in repeating actions over and over. On the flip-side, missions generally last anywhere from 5-10 minutes each, so there's not too heavy of a time investment per battle. The brand new enemies of the game, the Ash-Aragami, are actually challenging to fight, and have interesting mechanics what making fighting them feel dangerous. Assault missions are a fresh addition to the game, utilizing an 8-man multiplayer squad to fight in a 5-minute mission against what feels like a pseudo-raid boss. 

[h1] The Story	[/h1]
For the story, its complete shit. Like irreparably garbage. And I thought GE2 had a cheesy story. I had high expectations of a gripping story for GE3, seeing as how they decided to bring back the setting of man-king being pushed to the brink. I was hoping for a gripping story about survival, what it means to be a God Eater, and the life of being a god slayer. However, what I got was a pile of anime garbage. The story is written extremely poorly -- so much so that I actually felt like throwing up because of how cringey it was. Whomever wrote this story was directing it towards an 8 year child who never experienced a generic hero story of fighting for your friends. It was so bad that at one point I ended up rooting for one of the perceived antagonists because their intentions were the most logical course of action. The characters in this game are so fucking shallow I don't even remember half their names, and I beat the main story. If you wanted to buy this game because of its story, don't. I would rate it a solid 1/10. With the 1 being because Hugo is the only normal looking person you'll see in this game and that Zeke got a small but relatable amount of character development nearing the end.

[h1] Things that should have been brought back from the previous games	[/h1]
These are things that I wish were brought back from GER and GE2, these things probably won't matter to you if you haven't played the previous games.
[*] All of the old monsters. Wow, there the hell did they go.
[*] All of the old weapon parts. 
[*] The whole bullet customization. While I understand that GER and GE2's bullet customizer was broken OP, GE is a single-player game. Your not exactly hurting someone by using them.
[*] Predator styles -- the best part of GER.
[*] Characters that were actually (sort of) likable and made sense.
[*] Clothing variety. In GE3, it looks like somebody shat on EVERY single piece of clothing with this hyper-textured black duct tape. It's a really odd design choice.

[h1] Overall Rating: 6.8/10 [/h1]
I honestly can't recommend you buy this game for 60$. Honestly, the only reason why I got this game in the first place was because I got a 20% discount (from owning the previous games) and another 5$ off on top of that (Steam Chinese New Year Sale).

Unless we're talking about AVX2 then that's understandable since CPUs from 2016 and newer support it.
and I'm sure if they do patch it for yall to play, they will most likely push that to the 1.2 patch in March/April. (If you look at the patch/content adding roadmap they posted; and not surprising if they do that for the ""fix"")

Anyways I really enjoyed the game and is a bit short but it's to be expected. (base game in the series are short; patiently waiting for the expansion)
Story isn't as good as the 1st 2; mostly because [spoiler]their are no deaths in the story except one but nothing happens to the main cast[/spoiler] and the main cast of characters backgrounds arent explored as much compared to the previous 2 entries. But I still enjoyed the story though.
Gameplay is faster than ever though and difficulty is about roughly the same as the previous entries. Unless we're talking about the expansion of God Eater 2.
Customization options for character creation and clothing are muuuuch more limited, compared to the 1st entry in the series (if you exclude the 2 expansions; 1st games base has about nearly twice as many clothing and alot more hair options) But it will be fixed in the 1.2 and 1.3 patches since they will be adding more character options, skin color change in Appearance tab even after you made your character; and more clothing/Accessories to choose from (and more Accessories that can be unlocked in a new mission type set in 1.2; Side note: roughly around 100 missions to be added)

It shares its flaws for being repetitive i mean its a hunting game, if that is not your cup of tea then i wouldn't recommend this to you. Fans of this series will immediately feel at ease and get the most fun out of this, but newcomers will take some time to get used to the mechanics and system of this game.

Gameplay is more fast-paced.

Good chunk of content will come soon.

Anyways, if you enjoyed the first two God Eater games, you'll enjoy this one, especially if you're playing with friends. Although this game doesn't take place in the Far East Branch like the last two games, this one takes place in Northern Europe. With that being said, you don't get to see any returning characters in the series [spoiler](excluding Soma, or Ein as he goes by in this game)[/spoiler], but the new characters we group up with I do enjoy them a lot. In my opinion, I enjoyed them much more than your blood unit from the second game (even tho I do like them as well). For the story, it isn't as long as the other two games, but at least until update 1.30 comes out. The plot is great as well, maybe much more enjoyable than the last two, at least imo. For the enemies, most, if not, all return. They even have new ones which some can be challenging. Some of those new enemies I like to fight against, but the Havakiri is the one I dread the most fighting against. Then you got the ash aragami which makes battles a little more interesting. Just like God Eaters and AGE's, they can also devour and if they successfully hit you or your teammates with it, then they enter burst mode, they somewhat do more damage to you and they'll unleash their strongest attack which if you're not careful or don't have proper equipment, you'll get one shot. Lastly, I want to talk about the assault missions. It's nice to have you and 7 other players tackling different variations of ash aragami. The only down side is that you got 5 minutes to complete these missions, which can be done easily with good equipment and with at least one other teammates and not NPC's using players avatars. If you start a mission and there are still slots left to join before the countdown timer goes to 0, NPC's take those slots with peoples avatars. So if no one joins, then you have 7 NPC's fight alongside with you, which is nice and all, but it does make the missions much more difficult to complete within the 5 minute time limit as the NPC's aren't really that good. Other than that, I did enjoy this game a whole lot. It's my favorite in the series. Even ended up getting 100% achievements in the game.

I was really surprised at the lack character customization options.
Come on, it's 2019 and there are still no sliders on God Eater? Still just top and bottom for outfits?
Costume color still preset? MHW came out earlier than this (though I assume with a higher budget than this). Even Dragon's Dogma has better character customization options than this (and it was first released 7 years ago).

The story could also use a bit of work. Though God Eater didn't really boast a good enough story to rival other RPGs, I thought that GE2 had the best story so far in this franchise and I had high hopes for GE3. But sadly, almost half through the story, the story is really bland I must say.

Where God Eater franchise shines is the combat system and I must say GE3 still nailed it at that department. Combat is still fluid and fast. The burst art system is a blast to use. The engage system is pretty ""meh"". Sad to see the aragami bullets gone, and the custom bullets nerfed (the number you can carry is very limited). But combat is pretty much fun.

Recommending this game?

good game, huge improvement over past titles, fast paced mission based taking giant monsters down fun.

Having played the two previous titles, I went in with not quite as high expectations. Don't get me wrong the past two games were also good, but the amount of improvement this has over GER and GE2RB is insane.
Two new weapon types that are both extremly fun to play. Combat feels a lot faster paced and (with the exception of one enemy) still seems fair. Missions aren't purely ""you fought one Quadriga, how about three Quadriga?"" anymore thanks to the addition of quite a lot new enemy types. Assault missions are a great addition (and hopefully will further improve because right now finding 7 players that aren't bots is impossible thanks to region lock). Fast devour was kept, acceleration trigger and engage are neat new mechanics. Game is still fun even after completing the story since Rank 7 missions are challenging, but also not unfair.
Game will have additional missions added along with costumization options, etc. later down the line according to the developer, which is also a huge plus.
Story is... well... don't expect too much of the story since in the end it is God Eater after all.

Overall I have to tip my hat off to the devs improving so much from the core gameplay. Great game, would definetly recommend.

graphismes and mechanics are improved than 1 and 2 first game, just missed my blood rage :/ . character look pretty good, hugo is my bro and claire my panty shot waifu xD. musics are basically same than 2 first game but they work perfectly, Ra ost look like blood rage ost so i like it. Story is good and dramactic like all god eater stories but is look like remake of first story with mix of gundam blood orphans story ( hugo is basicaly mixup of orga and hugo from this game, for me ). Aragami is a very good surprise, they so beautiful and have great mechanics that make battle difficult if you don't do the good thing, especially the final boss because that the only one defeat me ( final boss in old GE game are little weird ).

Review: 8.5/10 Solo, 7/10 Multiplayer
TL;DR - Not the best game for multiplayer challenges. Great game for solo challenges and multiplayer farming.

Story: Loli/10
Trash Anime story can be pretty much ignored. but not the worst thing I've played / read / watched. It will be enjoyable enough if you enjoy watching crappy animes. 

Environments: 7/10
The battle arenas are small and not layered. Easy to Navigate but there are only 14-15 of them so sometimes they can get repetitive. and while playing multiplayer they don't seem to make a difference. but as you get into the solo challenges, They play a critical role in optimization. They are significantly less interesting than monster hunter's but also significantly less frustrating to navigate.

Monsters: 5/10
There are enough Monster Types to keep things interesting in varied. They're all very different to fight when Solo. This leads to strong variety. However when Multiplayer, they can all feel similar because they all just get brow beat into the ground. Not as interesting as they were in monster hunter.

Music: 8/10
There's a couple weird tracks but the music is 100% customizable, you can listen to any track on any mission and theres some good stuff. it would be 6/10 if forced to listen to w/e they had on. some stuff just doesn't fit the theme

Gameplay - break into separate parts

Combat:10/10
Combat is bar none hands down better than any other hunting game I've played and easily the games strongest suit.

Crafting:7/10
Crafting is less grindy and more accessible than monster hunter. Weapons end up thematically looking like the creatures you obtain the parts from. but there is no armor to craft.

Accessibility: 10/10
Monster Hunter makes you spend a lot of time grinding hunter ranks to access content. God Eater doesn't make you spend time grinding stuff for no reason. You fight to farm or to progress. No arbitrary requirements.

Consumables/Inventory Management ???/10: (8.5/10 for me personally)
They are WAY easier to get and way less tedious than managing the farm on MH or sending out palicos. This is a huge QoL improvement for me. But some people like the consumable and inventory management of MH so this would depend on your preference. If you are the kind of person who finds consumables in MH Tedious then you will enjoy this better.

Replay Value: ????/10 (9/10 for me personally)
Due to the need to grind a lot of different armors/hunter rank to unlock content I feel Monster Hunter has higher replay value. Replay Value in God Eater boils down to farming parts for various weapons/shields. Then it comes together with executing the solo high rank challenges. If you're into optimization, speed runs, and solo achievements, then theres endless replay value.

Solo Challenge: 10/10
There is literally an impossible amount of solo challenges and the bosses are all VERY difficult and VERY fun to optimize when playing solo.

Multiplayer Challenge: 1/10
3 newbs to the series basically steamrolled all of the content in MP. Even the last bosses died in 2 mins a pop. It's just a really easy game on multiplayer because theres no scaling. Same difficulty 1-4 players or npcs. Monsters get beat down fast. That being said, it's still very fun to play multiplayer for farming items to make gear. I think the sweet spot is 2 players. Things are still mildly challenging and you can optimize gameplay for a duo team real well.

Transparency: 7.5/10
The game is quite transparent in many ways. It is very clear about your percentages you gain while under certain effects, or what you gain from certain buffs. However, not everything is as transparent as it should be. For example consumables for the most part are a mystery. For Monster Hunter veterans however, they should be use to the obtuse nature of the genre. God Eater is miles ahead of Monster Hunter in transparency.

60$ for 60 Hours:
Finished all content in 66 hours steam rolling bosses in multiplayer...would probably have taken 80-100 hours if i was solo, even just with NPC instead of real people. I DID stop to farm multiple weapons and try things out along the way. I did not burn to endgame ASAP. In my opinion the price tag on the game is well worth it. I'm at 85 hours at this time of this writing and still planning to try and achieve as much of the solo rewards as I can, using time with friends to farm monster parts and money.",1550453530,1550462499,True,2,0,0.512141287326812744,0,True,False,False

Only one thing to note after having played for a while. They *REALLY* need a better in-game tutorial. Things aren't explained well enough to really take advantage of the enhanced combat system, you either have to dig through the in-game database on the terminal or go online and look things up if you want to really improve beyond just a basic level. Once we started the end run I began to run into Aragami that were difficult to beat, dropping from SSS ratings to B ratings almost instantly, the basic in-game explanations of combat are enough to beat the game but nowhere near sufficient to master the combat system.

The same applies to the implanted skills, which weren't gone over well enough when they came up, I still had a lot of questions as to how to make efficient use of them that required some online research. Even that was difficult as, probably due to this being a fairly recent game, not much was even out there and I kept coming up with irrelevant search results I figured it out, through trial and error, but I suspect that I probably wasted 20-30k worth of Abandoned God Arcs experimenting with things (Yes, I know, should've save scummed a bit and played with things without investing the team's funds into experimentation) before I got it right.

Really liking the new systems, and the new (especially Biting Edge, the ray gun isn't bad but I still prefer the sniper) weapons, plus the story isn't bad so far.

The only down side is the same as with all of these kind of games. Grinding for rare materials to upgrade and construct new equipment and hoping for lucky drops in missions. I'm only a few hours in and I'm already running into upgrades that have me scanning the rewards lists for maps and then playing them repeatedly to get that one missing item.

Some notes on the launch version:

Dual audio at launch rather than via DLC or not at all, set to Japanese by default, changed it to English so I could get a listen (and the dub doesn't seem ear bleedingly bad) before switching back to play.

The game interface was in Japanese to start, after muddling around with my very poor Japanese trying to find the setting to change it I discovered the setting is NOT in game, you will find it under ""properties"" in the Steam client.

The game defaulted to integrated graphics, good enough to create your character and walk around the initial area talking to people, but you'll need to hit the control panel for your GPU and set it to use discrete graphics in order to actually fight.

So far so good.

Me, watching the trailer: ""oh""
Me, after completing the game in 48 hours: ""eh that was still pretty good I guess""

All joking aside, if you enjoyed GE:R and GE2:RB then you will almost certainly enjoy GE3, as it's still basically the same game but with a few improvements here and there and new mechanics that make the gameplay somewhat more fast-paced and fresh, along with a couple new weapon types and a decent amount of new Aragami thrown in for good measure. Also, having about 90% completely new assets (except for maybe returning Aragami and weapon models) makes it feel like more of a new game, compared to GE:R and GE2:RB.

On the flipside, if you've been interested in the God Eater series but never played any of them then GE3 is a good place to start.
-Most of the new mechanics and changes have made the game more forgiving and feel better than the previous games.
-A decent amount of new and returning Aragami to hunt using 8 different melee weapons and 4 different gun types that all play differently means lots of replayability that's there if you want it.
-The AI teammates are very competent (for the most part) and customizable to suit your needs when you're not playing with friends.
-The story has almost nothing to do with the previous games so you won't have to worry about missing out on any important ""lore"" (except a few references and allusions that are exclusively text-based inside the in-game glossary).

One thing in particular I will mention is that at the time of writing, the avatar customization options are pretty lacking when it comes to hairstyles and clothes to wear (the starting costume is probably the best-looking one in the game IMO).

We will apparently be getting more customization options in future free content updates, along with new post-game story missions, teammates, Aragami, and mission types, so if making your anime OC look as rad as possible is a big sticking point for you, or if you just want more bang for your buck, you might want to consider waiting until a couple of those updates drop before you buy.

Joke aside, the game is basically just ""You play in those maps"" to ""Fight those specific monsters"". I was expecting the game to be... you know like Open World RPG game. But in the end, this is still your generic God Eater series.

The formula never changed, which is not a bad thing, because the game emphasize on ""Fighting monsters"" rather than ""Reading a story"" or ""Develop a in-game relationship"" or ""Research stuff"". You just do missions to progress, with optional ones giving you ""extra mile for extra reward"".

Fighting bigger sized monsters, you hit for the weak point until it breaks (bond break) which drop more monster materials while also making the monster take additional damage to the said weak points.

Devour to gain ""Link bullet"" but you cannot use it as aragami bullet like GE 2 anymore, due to the game emphasize on link burst to gain overall combat advantages. And indeed, working together is always better than doing everything alone.

Consumables have their uses, and pick yours carefully. From healing pills to utility traps, you will need to plan what to carry with you while discarding the rest inside your storage for your upcoming fights.

New monsters, they all are cool and pain in the ass to fight. Skater girl, Chicken Assassin, Drill Gecko, Screaming Woman head, and much more lesser monsters. While old ones like Turbine Crocodile, Bird man, Butterfly woman, Air Gun Frog, Sparky Tiger, Sparky Tiger dad, Fire Lizard, Ice Lizard, Fox, Whale Assassin, Scorpion, Mr. Tank, Angry Fish, and Gauntlet Wolf (Psion) are here as well. A few monsters are missing however, wonder if they're scratched or may be added back in the future, like Blitz the lightin lizard, Sparky Tigress, Cannon dude, Cannon Dog, and Moaning Sheep. Heck, I really miss those golden angry fish for all of the delicious bond break stuff and money.

What's even more challenging is the game adds Ash Aragamis that look so scary, we'll just call them Ashgami for now. Even Psion... Psionamis aren't gonna match their power who shown up in God Eater 2. Floater dude, Rotten Fist, Jet Lion, Triple head Crocodile freak, and Anubis (Kyubby 2.0). When they devour god eaters, THEY TRANSFORM, you would actually feel threatened rather than having a chuckle and melt down that monster with just 1 custom bullet shot.

Now, the game entirely emphasize on melee combats due to the newly introduced ""Burst Arts"" which you devour to activate them. They don't help much, but still a help in a fight nonetheless. Yes, Blood Arts are here as well. However, for those who loves to one shot monsters in GE 2, or players like me who spammed the hell out of rifle bullet in GE 2, you better start learning melee, because the game won't let you overuse custom bullets anymore or cheese it through with guns, as custom bullets are limited by 1000 capacity at max. But worry not, in-game default bullets are good enough as long as you aim for the sweet spot.

However, a warning to people who expect this to be like Monster Hunter World, you will be very disappointed as the game doesn't offer more than what MHW did. Yet, you can't blame the company who made this game previously only for hand-held consoles, this 3rd installment really showed they tried to polish the game, but not much.

But, this game has a new challenge mode called as Assault. You que up to with 7 players to fight Ashgami together in FIVE minutes. But don't worry, even if you fail, you still get stuff and new engage units. So don't be shy, que it up, and bring down that monster together.

Do I recommend the game? 

Yes, if you are players that just purely love hardcore ""Timing"" in a hack and slash game. I personally like the game because I enjoy playing a simple ""monster-hunting"" in a ""hack and slash"" game. And this is entirely a cool sci-fi nonetheless.

No, because the game is like ""You fight those monsters in those maps"" over and over, aside of that, the story isn't very strong due to you would mostly just read those stuff from database (mail box) for what just happened and what is gonna happen. Especially the game cost a price like this

One of the most polished God Eater series games I've ever played. The combat feels the same as the previous series, but faster paced and more chaotic with new weapons and monsters to fight against. Definitely a step-up in that regards. I do recommend getting the game because it's a complete game. However, as a true fan of the GE series, I have a lot of things to say about this game...

Story:
The story is amazing. The animation and characters are decent. Not entirely great, but decent. The character's personality doesn't match with their decisions sometimes. So it's kind of awkward. They did nail a few of the characters perfectly. The charismatic leader and the troublemaker. They really know how to create a good main character.

Gameplay:
Gameplay feels fluid as ever. It's too chaotic at most times for me. I couldn't see when the enemy is going to attack because of so many effects flying across the screen for me. I do think it's a bit too fast for my eyes. I may be getting too old. It's just that when fighting monsters, I couldn't tell what their attacks were and I couldn't block since it was so sudden. I kept taking damage when I wanted to do a ""good"" run without taking much damage. Good thing the farming for consumables isn't too troublesome. Otherwise, it would have been such a chore.

My gripes with the game:
1. Story. It's too short when compared to the previous games. I love long and engaging story. This game provides that, but it felt too short. I paid full price to get a story that's half of the previous titles. It's a bit upsetting for me. I wanted to play more.

2. Customization. I find it frustrating that some of the clothes have such an amazing design (despite the many tapes..). It's such a great design except for the colour scheme. If only I can pick Primary, Secondary and Tertiary colors to apply to the clothes. So I can get my own colour scheme to an outfit design that I like.. If the same is applied to weapons as well, I couldn't be happier to get my own weapon that I can somehow design myself.

3. Multiplayer Aspect. I don't care too much about the multiplayer setting. I just really love the story and get as strong as I can in a single-player game. Don't listen to those people saying ""Single-Player games are dead"". I LOVE these kinds of games. Single-player games. It has a place in my heart.

4. No Endgame. In this game, there's no New Game Plus. In a previous game, you can get an NG+ and get lots of outfits to try out, unlock weapons and use the new stuff just to play the entire game again. Except for this time, you're a lot more prepared and cooler looking... The only thing is that I couldn't start a New Game Plus, without having to use an item that I've farmed more than 1 day worth of farming in game. I couldn't use a weapon that I've honed and polished throughout the first playthrough, only to just let it stay there. Not being able to use it until I've unlocked that specific rank of that weapon... I find that so sad... I've completed the entire game, made 100% completion and it is half the time I've spent in God Eater 2 Rage Burst... I find that to be not satisfying enough..

Regardless of my rant, thank you for the game. I enjoyed it. I just wish I could play more...",1550333764,1550334245,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
899440,49033431,76561198109036604,271,4,7536,0,5859,1704305122,"Current status; 87.6 hours, 100% achievement completion. Will probably return to it and grind out some more specific Rank 7 sets, even before the updates arrive.

Though it lacks the extended content of Resurrection and 2 Rage Burst (especially if you consider those game's two-for-one dealing), God Eater 3 is perhaps the most refined rendition of the series to date. It is a far more balanced game, from the gunplay to the Burst Arts, and also cuts off a lot of those game's excess (mainly through a largely reduced number of redundant Optional missions).

Customisation is a little limited compared to the previous games, with a reduced number of hairstyles and clothing options. However, there is allegedly to be additions to hairstyles, clothing and accessories with the upcoming free updates, so this could change. Despite having a smaller overall variety in clothing, GE3 does have one point in its favour - for each article of clothing, not only is there the standard four colour variations but now also four styles of wear. You can craft, say, a longcoat worn normally, with a longer shirt, shorter coat, or both. If the game does receive a larger variety of clothing, these options will surely become more appreciated. Oh, and if you really like tape, this is the game for you.

Gameplay is a little easier than the previous entries, but can still catch you off guard if you get sloppy. The game only goes up to Rank 7, right now, and unfortunately lacks the post-game Perilous Challenge option. Aragami HP seems lower overall. However, they're noticeably more aggressive and harder-hitting, so those who have trouble blocking/evading attacks (or forget to upgrade their Shields) may find themselves taken by surprise.

Custom Bullets now have limited ammo which you assign before going out on a mission, instead of consuming OP. This ammo carries over between multi-mission Expeditions, as well. As such, they contain limited uses, greatly nerfing them from their previous meteoric glory. From personal experience, they're now most useful for a one-time burst of damage, or a backup ally healing supply.

Burst Arts are the successor to Blood Arts. Only usable in Burst, as the name suggests, you can assign three of them now instead of just one, and there's no Black Blood Art equivalent. Combined with a lack of Blood Rage, these become much more balanced and less gameplay-defining than Blood Arts were. Instead of having to focus around landing one specific move, you have more options, and sometimes those options can act more as supplements (such as any given attack that puts you in the air) than primary offensive moves.

The Engage mechanic adds an extra team dynamic to the game, both giving people who enjoy playing alongside the story characters something extra to do with them and those who enjoy multiplayer an extra between-player factor to consider. It also makes maintaining Burst 3 far easier solo, which is always a plus. Acceleration Triggers give you an extra, smaller goal to consider at any given time to maintain top performance (whether it be not getting hit, devouring a certain number of times, perfect guarding, etc), adding some variety into any given gameplan.

The music is great as always, and most of the new Aragami are fun and interesting. Havakiri is a bit annoying, but she's getting nerfed in an upcoming patch, hopefully becoming far more manageable. All of the new Ash Aragami fights are quite entertaining, and the tactics of whether to avoid, perfect guard or purposefully jump in front of a devour give them a fun dynamic, along with the change in patterns should they enter their Burst state.

All in all, a very fun game, and overall a solid improvement in gameplay from the previous two, already great, games. If you can't stand an anime aesthetic or story you'll probably have something of an annoyed time with it, but those that don't mind or enjoy such a thing (either ironically or seriously) can find a very enjoyable, somewhat arcadey hunting game here. With all hope, the upcoming three updates will add even more to the game, quelling some complaints about its smaller content load.

Also Phym is absolutely precious and I'll fight anyone who claims otherwise.",1550334155,1550334155,True,1,0,0.508426964282989502,0,True,False,False

I was a huge fan of God Eater Resurrection and Rage Burst, and I was excited at the announcement of the new game. That being said, I really wasn't prepared for how excellent this game looks and plays. From the moment the opening cinematic starts playing with Stereo Future by BiSH starts playing, I knew this game was something special. So let's jump in...

[h1]Visuals and Sound[/h1]
The aesthetic style of God Eater has always been distinctly anime, with a ton of options and a stark contrast between the clean, neat world of the academies and ships and the barren, abandoned wastelands the God Eaters fight in. That being said, the style here has gone a completely different direction, and you'll be spending your time in a prison and caravan, both of which have a lived in, grimier feel to them between missions. They just look more lived in than the previous hub worlds. It's kind of a refreshing take on the style. The level design retains the same simplistic map style from previous entries, the maps look a lot more detailed and just seem to ""fit"" better than other entries.

The character design is excellent, though for some reason we only have 10 hairstyles this time around for female characters, and the wardrobe choices are a little better, in my mind, even if they've still kept the horridly impractical wardrobe choices from prior entries for female NPCs. Expect fanservice here, friends, and lots of it. Hilda especially is a throwback to Tsubaki from the first entry: a matronly figure that, of course, has impractically large breasts and wears clothing that certainly isn't modest, and be aware - jiggle physics are in full effect here. It's kind of a minor gripe, but it's a trope that's been done to death, and it's kind of tiresome, especially because Hilda is really portrayed as a smart, confident, and independent woman.  

Also, we need to address the elephant in the living room about the moe character design of Phym. While I don't have a problem with moe, and generally speaking, the character is not overtly sexualized, the community reaction I've seen that clearly has loli connotations disturbs me. I get it, Japanese sensibility is a bit different, but c'mon guys, get your minds right and stop making sexual comments about a child.

The Aragmi design is phenomenal, and you'll see old and new entries to the bestiary. I've fought my share of Ogretails, Zygotes, and Cocoon Maidens, along with new Aragami like the Axe Raider and Blast Spider.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
So, one of the big things that has separated Monster Hunter and God Eater has been the pace of combat. I never really enjoyed Monster Hunter, and was kind of turned off on it before giving it a fair shake but the faster paced combat of God Eater always appealed to me. And you won't be disappointed here, as the pace is picked up even further and animations are more fluid. I would say that this is the first entry in the series where every single weapon is completely viable. The boost hammer feels like it's finally balanced and the buster blade isn't totally overpowered anymore. The real stars of the show, however, are the two new weapons: the heavy moon (a huge chakra that lets you basically dance around the battlefield) and biting edge (a pair of daggers that you dual wield). The awesome thing about these is that both weapons transform into something new; the biting edge can be combined into a staff that provides increased damage and mobility options as the cost of stamina, and the heavy moon transforms into both an axe and a chainsaw. That's right, a CHAINSAW. They've also ditched the blast gun in favor of a ray gun, which, while novel, was a little disappointing, because I loved the blast gun. Why can't we have both?

Devours are back along with new concepts like dives, customizable burst arts that allow for new combos, acceleration triggers that give passive buffs, and engage triggers that let you have a two-piece buff with another ally, Bullets are done a little differently here, and if you're not upgrading or crafting new bullets early on, your guns will have severely diminished value.

You'll also have clearer visual clues about what's going on in the battlefield than previous series. The color output of slashes and numerical damage values are far more exaggerated here, which makes it easier to see at an immediate glance how effective your attacks are and whether or not you're attacking the right spot.

In terms of NPCs, you're going to hear a lot of talk about playing multiplayer. I never played Multiplayer in God Eater, and I'm not about to start now. I can't speak to the multiplayer, but I will tell you the NPCs are competent, and I haven't had to spend an inordinate amount of time babysitting them on missions. They can get a little finicky about healing you, but if you pop a few heal rounds here any then, or pop a few burst rounds when you have them, your NPC allies will shine.

[h1]Story[/h1]
First thing's first: you do not have to have played God Eater 1 or 2 to enjoy this game. God Eater 1 laid the groundwork for how the world got the way it is, how the Aragami came about , what God Arcs are, who God Eaters are, etc. But the game teases enough clues to bring you up to speed if you've never played a god eater game before. You won't see any characters from previous games except for one.

A lot of people have criticized the writing in this game, though I'm not sure why. I've been enjoying the story immensely. It's incredibly dark, tragic, and explores some heavy themes related to the struggle for survival, slavery, and child abuse. I will admit the English voice acting can get a little campy at times. The English voice acting is superb, though, and I feel like they made the most out of a script that maybe wasn't so great. I use the English localization because I really want to hear when Amy is giving me battle updates. Amy is great - she tells you exactly when an engage trigger is ready, when your bust bar is almost out, stuff like that. It makes it easy to focus solely on the combat without glancing at your gauges too often.

While we're on the characters, they deliver through and through. In God Eater 1, I really didn't like any of the characters, except for Alisa and Kanon. In God Eater 2, I didn't like any of the characters except... well... Alisa and Kanon. Here there's a full cast of characters that have life, personality, and I found myself falling in love with them all. Hugo, Zeke, and Keith are fantastic, the Pennywort children add some depth to the cast, Hilda, Amy, and Ricardo are wonderful, Claire is right up there with Kanon for me, Phym is overly moe, I could have done without it, but the character I think steals the show is Lulu. She's topped the list as my favorite character of the entire series.

[h1]So, should you buy it?[/h1]
That depends. In terms of the genre, God Eater 3 is a top contender, and I think the love fest that Monster Hunter: Worlds carried with it is still running strong, and God Eater is invariably compared to it. That being said, it's a much different game within the genre, and if you find Monster Hunter too slow, this is a great entry into the genre. The combat is fast paced but fair, it eases you into concepts, and the NPCs are competent. The character modification is robust, and with tons of recipes to craft, you'll have a lot of fun modifying your character and their loadout.

This is definitely a situation where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and I think this game deserves far higher accolades than it's getting on the major review outlets. If you like carrying impractically huge weapons around, having a lot of modification options, and fighting ffrantic battles against monsters large and small, then this is the game for you.",1550332987,1550333417,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ Graphics
+ Fluid and challenging combat.
+ Good story, and progresses at a decent pace, compared to the previous game that had 3-5 missions before a significant cutscene occurs.
+ Gear progression is balanced.
+ Simplified interface compared to the previous game.

Cons
- Customization of gear seems lackluster, difference is barely noticable.
- Customizatoin in appearance is very minimal. Only 10 hairstyles and there are about 5-7 costumes in total in reality, but has ""alternate"" versions of clothes.
- Aggro/Threat/Enmity seems to be more fixated on the highest damage dealer, even with abilities enabled on team mates that supposedly get targetted more.

To elaborate on customization of gear, it's quite simply put: High Attack > All.
Having testing it thoroughly, Abandoned God Arc Parts do not add much to the table compared to the previous game, and can even be ignored for the entire game. You'll never feel you missed them, and you won't feel 'em if you have them on.

The Good: 

+ Combat system is very enjoyable, with a lot of customization to weapons, special moves and ranged combat. It's less about ""learning"" a weapon like in MH but more about defining your own style and setting your personal preferences. The game has more ""critter missions"" in the beginning so it takes a bit longer until you get to the challenging monsters at first.

+ Husbandos and Waifus through the roof, character creation could be more expansive but is still a very enjoyable process. Clothing is not tied to your abilities so it's pure fashion, thank god. Apparently more clothing options are going to be added to the game.

+ General atmosphere of the game, especially since it follows a more fleshed out story than MH. Some veterans of the series critisize it for not being as good as God Eater: Resurrection, but the story still motivated me enough to keep playing and doesn't use that much anime melodrama so it can actually be taken somewhat seriously. General anime tropes still apply of course, but I really didn't mind them a lot. Maybe because I beat KH3 recently which was utter shit.

+ Soundtrack is very enjoyable

+ There's a patch coming up which aims to add more customization options, QoL improvements and more missions in early 2019.

The Bad:

- Tutorials somewhat lacking for newcomers, so you may need to look up some stuff if you want the master the various components of combat (which could be a + though, depending on how you look at it)

- The maps are forgettable and don't play any role in combat, which is a pity since the setting and lore are very cool. In MH monsters would live in specific parts of the map alluding to their nature, collecting items felt more like rummaging through the wilderness instead of ""oh there's a shiny on the floor"" and I haven't encountered any environmental effects up to now.  

- The missions aren't set up very well, you just go to where the marker on your minimap points you and start whacking. Which also adds to the maps feeling more like an afterthought. You're not led to explore the world and your surroundings while searching for the monster, there's no sense of discovery or anything to do next to the (very enjoyable) combat and managing your gear/inventory in the hub.

- Online is fractured due to region locking depending on your steam download region. Apparently this is/was remedied on the PS4 so the same may be true for the PC in the near future.

What you should expect:
- repetive gameplay, duh
- nice graphics but no new industry standard, still nice though
- the game is rather fast
- the amount of maps and monsters is not that big, many monster reskins
- lots of weapons and gameplay customisation options and I mean LOTS
- the game is easy to learn but gets harder with multiple enemies later on, so try to keep up
- its more polished than GER and GE2RB in every way but there is not that much new to the formula
- no open world: you will mostly have a hub, your mission maps and cutscenes
- its anime if you havent looked at the screenshots, so expect skin and voluptuous female body types
- the story is fine, I like the characters but its not convoluted enough to be dragged on for ages which I like

All in all it's a great middle shelf game. The price is a bit high (I would recommend buying it at 50$/40€ at some point), but the game itself is really fun and feels oldschool to the core in a positive way (no preorder bonus, no dlc, no day one patch). I personally think that most of the professional reviews are a joke, because most of these ""journalists"" are too young and/or too stuck up so that God Eater 3 confuses them. Not any hunting game is a Monster Hunter clone like not any action RPG is Dark Souls. Not every game has to have overboarding tutorials, open worlds and guidelines to take all effort from you. Silent protagonists are fine and a style of choice. I'm loooking at you ""It's a great game 6/10"" -Trashreactor. You can boil down most of the criticism to ""Its not Monster Hunter. The game doesnt hold my hand. The graphics dont toast my rig. Anime girls dont wear burkha. I call it repetetive because I want to shit on it while I compare it to Monster Hunter aka Monster Repetitor.""
Dark Souls didnt have a tutorial,
Skyrim had a silent protagonist,
Persona 5 is anime styled,
Monster Hunter is repetive,
Shit games?
Serious though. Complaining about a silent protagonist is an asspull by journalists to show that they didnt get paid by the games publisher. F-ing industry leads have silent protagonists.

So don't confuse yourself over it. I noticed no bugs up until now, performance is great (FX-8350, GTX 960 4GB, 16GB RAM, no OC), the gaming experience is as pure and as vanilla as it gets. 8,5/10 from me, a 9/10 if they add new stuff in the future.

It's a worthy successor to GE1 and GE2. Glaring issues have been fixed, many existing systems improved, combat is extremely fluid now and the graphics have gotten an upgrade compared to the older games. 

Apparently there is a CPU issue where if it doesn't have the AVX instruction set  the game will not run, will crash on boot. I believe this is a problem with really old CPUs; you'll have to look this one up yourself for a better explanation i suppose. Mouse input is acceptable but it has weird acceleration and feels like its trying to emulate joystick movement; this needs fixing basically. Some people may have an issue with a 60 fps lock, but know at least the game runs very smoothly. 

The game's pretty steep at 80 CAD to be honest, I got it on sale with the loyalty discount and the lunar new year discount leaving me at 57 CAD. 40 CAD a definite buy. 57 CAD well get it if you cant wait and like this genre of game; monster hunting with super human movement and many types of weapons to use. 

I'm biased i suppose since i never buy games full price.  Games about 40 hours though main story if you just stick with one weapon set (melee, gun, shield) for those that care about length.

As far as I can tell this game doesn't do anything better than them. Some things are worse. Burst arts are less interesting than Blood arts were and I don't see why the didn't put predator forms back in; they let you stay more aggressive because you didn't need as big of an opening to refresh burst. Weapons are all still extremely similar to one another. Your play style doesn't really change depending on your weapon, you just use different attacks and square and triangle attacks still do the same damage so there's no reason to mix up combos except to close distance.

As for the story, it's also worse. I feel like only a few of the jrpgs with character customisation do it well. Yeah you can make a cool looking character, but because you're now a silent protagonist they have another character that is the main character. You are not the main character in this game, Hugo is. It was better in the other two games, here I'd rather just have a set character to play as honestly. Same problem was in Xenoblade X where Elma was actually the main character, not you. They also turned up the cringey anime tropes to 11 in this. Almost every character is done-to-death cliche. The cutscenes are either hard to watch shonen anime or frustrating because you're watching someone else be the hero.

This one got sort of short story and didn't build up enough of the mood. I feel like it just rushes to the ending too quickly. It got a lot less character so the mailbox system can't be used, so sad.

Pros
- Good story(a lot plainer than its predecessor but still enjoyable)
- The combat system is pretty well done by combining the blood art(which is burst art in this one) and devour ability together.
- Impressive soundtrack

Cons
- The inside caravan's texture and the light are terrible, it like the dev don't even bother adjusting the light and shadow.
- Although the story is good but lacks impact unlike, GE2 when Romeo come back and Juliet's curry scene, GE1 when Shio is gone.
- No side story.
- Abandon God arc part got nerf, I can no longer make and overpower build as I used to in GE1&2(But it did improve the game balance).

The graphics are alright,  the sounds are okay although some of the voices you can pick can be rather annoying, but the game is about one thing:
Combat
And this is where it really shines.

Combat is fast paced (suck it MHW), and looks and feels fantastic. Chaining Combos and utilising every tool the game provides to wreck some big monsters is really fun and fluid on top of that.

The english voice-over can be quite cringy, but I don't mind that much. On the plus side, the soundtrack is fantastic.

Multiplayer / Co-op works well, I experienced no lag or other inconveniences.

as a fan of god eater I bought at least god eater ressurection and god eater 2 ( which the story based on friendship for god eater 2 but very well done in god eater ressurection ). 
alright here it goes 

Pros
- new 2 blade weapon moonblade and dual blade, new 1 projectile weapon ray gun  
- moon blade is very well done, easy to use and had a knack of the crack for the power ( yea lad you are the lumber jack cut that thing down ! )
- ray gun easy to use make sure you bring that reserve ammo 
- new combat mechanism ( they change the imploder item drop from the zygote to spider aragami ?? hmmmm.... pretty reasonable )
- FRICKING DUB JAP FINALLY I'VE BEEN TORTURED BY ENG DUB 
- New aragami and it seems some of the remake version too. ( but  I like the zoid vajra they called it Bahrung I suppose ? kinda cool when you get a new blade weapon like that )
- easy to control with keyboard ( depend how you like it or not but I didnt play using keyboard. Always use a joystick when it come to JRPG game ) 
- Lv 100 boss ash aragami when you get contacted with it ( get devoured ) you know you F up as long as you didnt get their absolute zero ( the super ultimate aragami attack with 1 shot kill, freaking poison ash aragami got 1x death in there ) 

neutral 
- story seems meh but kinda cute when you have that nymph follow you like a rabbit 

cons
- what is this no aragami bullet ? :( why you get rid that cool bullet tou ? 
- the burst kinda shorter ? ( I feel the burst kinda shorter, it was me or it is already like that from the last GE ? )
- trust me you are not gonna use that gun very often since no aragami bullet ( from the last Ge I use a gun very often for aragami bullet right now it seems like I didnt need it ) 
- rough start ( since your character treated like dog from the beginning who am I to argue but the price for crafting for the first time seems reasonable ) 
- what happened from the lore before ? ( I assume since the red rain incident the new type of disaster is envolving and aragami become more micro and making it harder to spot and become like ash thing { you can call it like you know from the mummy movie, the wrath of anubis or paraoh ? } ) 

oh well anyway 
the story based on after the fenrir HQ fallen ( East fenrir is fallen because this disaster I assume it as soma taking charge on the port and he disguise himself as Ein to hide his identity for some reason ) you are from the pennyworth treated like a dog, a subject, failure human so to speak. but as always you are blessed with high tier capability and making you like an alpha wolf ( yea dude I name my character gats since the story like this ). and so by the name of god aragami your port got swallow by the ash storm and you pick up by some big tiddies blonde MILF ( as always there will be a BIG TIDDIES MILF AS NPC ), and so on after the container BIG TIDDIES MILF ( heuheuhe ) breaches by ash aragami, you soon found out yourself like soma story ( if you play GE resurection you probably now it ). and then as always there will be a bad and good ending tou. since I still continuing for the story almost get there but I will probably can tell where this is going since I already played Ge resurection and Ge 2, oh boi I didnt like where this is going either nyphm is banish from that world or he goes like shio did like the song from evangelion "" take me to the moon "" 
oh boy I didnt like this story going. 
oh well I hope they put the player character some 1 full sentence like GE 2 did ( you know when your silent character suddenly speaking I almost waking up a neighborhood because she/he speak for 1 sentence ) 
boi 
I rate it for 7/10 
dissapointed by no no no aragami bullet..... bring it back please :(

If you want the high speed, high intensity, anime-style Monster Hunter gameplay this series is known for then I imagine God Eater 3 will more than satisfy you. The story is nothing special but enough to keep you invested if you enjoyed Resurrection and Rage Burst's stories. There is less content than Resurrection and Rage Burst however you must remember that Resurrection is technically an expansion of God Eater Burst which itself was an expansion to the original God Eater and Rage Burst was an expansion for God Eater 2 which never made it out of Japan. With this in mind: it's likely that we will see more content being released for God Eater 3 in the future and 3 does have more content at launch than God Eater 1 and 2 did.

If however, you enjoyed Resurrection and Rage Burst primarily for their colorful cast of characters and the interactions between them in the character episodes, then this game will disappoint you. The cast of characters this time around is much smaller and less interesting while the character episodes are no where to be found. That's not to say that the characters are particularly bad, but they do come off as underwhelming compared to the cast we know from the Far East. 

Those of you who want more Aragami slaying will find that this title is more than enough to satisfy that desire. Those of you who loved the colorful cast but don't care for the gameplay will probably want to pass on this entry in the series.",1550104409,1550117514,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game lacks Polish for a whopping 80$ CDN price tag. It is not AAA Quality at all. The textures and models are PS2 Quality, environments are extremely poorly done. The Stages are extremely short and repetitive. Story lacks. 
Match making is Region locked by STATE! Meaning every game you try to join will be locked, unless the person so happens to have launched their download region from steam, in your state. Extremely frustrating to not have reliable multiplayer in a multiplayer title. 

All that aside. I enjoyed the character Art style a lot. It reminds me of Final Fantasy. The Western conversion is great, as the English voice acting is good. Character customization was pretty solid with 20 great voices to choose from. Combat is pretty decent too. 

I would happily buy this game for no more than 29.99$ CDN. And would get SOME enjoyment out of it. The current price tag is absolutely atrocious for what you're getting.

I'll update my review when patch 1.3 comes out, but for now, I'll just leave that up top as my opinion. 

First off, let's just say this:

God Eater 3's reinvention of the series combat formula is brilliant, and a breath of fresh air. Unfortunately, blood arts (now called ""Burst Arts"") have reappeared, and they basically ruin any form of decent game balance that God Eater Burst, or even God Eater Ressurection had. You start out weak, but the power ramp happens fast, and before long any sense of actual challenge becomes moot because spamming your BA's winds up being ridiculously overpowered. 

Moreso than ever before, combat is fast, fluid, and fun. While not having the same layer of strategic depth as say, Monster Hunter; The game fulfills the role of having a hack-and-slash monster farming set in a post-apocalyptic world with a unique concept that's both engaging and fulfilling to play. 

It's a shame then, that the universe happens to be it's weakest point this time around. The first two God Eater games really did a great job of emphasizing that the world that God Eater takes place isn't full of roses or humorous shenanigans like Monster Hunter, it's a fight for survival with humanity's survival on the line.

The story feels like it was dropped halfway in development. You can clearly see that they were setting up an elaborate plot premise wherein we possibly had the choice of joining either Gleipnir, which is a military faction set in Europe that has a: ""Protect Humanity at -any- cost."" dogma, while the Crimson Queen was a peace-seeking AGE's activist group that was willing to fight to protect their right to live in accordance to their desires.

This would have made for an incredibly interesting premise, but it just doesn't happen. Instead, the moment the Crimson Queen's are introduced, the game makes a sudden beeline for the ending, and all the actually interesting stuff that happens is generally narrated by Ein, while you just get to play all the mundane bits in between. 

The characters are weaker than they've ever been before. I legitimately can't remember the name of some of my party members minus the important ones, and that's not a good thing. Even God Eater 2 scores a lot better in this department.  They feel like cheap knock-offs of things you've seen before, and Shio 2.0 (while cute) ultimately doesn't come close to nailing the original charm that Shio had. 

Ultimately, if you're a fan then there's literally no reason to not get this game, but I'll warn you: Stay for the gameplay, and don't expect great things out of the story.

After the first day or two that I've owned this title. I can firmly say Its <slightly> worth 60 bucks. It has okay customization, enough to make your character unique in its own way. But has lots of different combat styles, with its decent weapon type options. From swords, spears, scythes, daggers, short-swords, BIG-swords, hammers, ""Heavy Moon"" (basically a moon-shaped big axe), and more from shot-guns, laser-cannons, sniper-rifles, and different variants of shields. The game offers you to customize your unique play-style. Along with tons of abilities different with each weapon type, each weapon-type containing a whole different style of combat with each, and also all the upgrades/perks/passive-abilities you can addon to your character to give it that extra OOMF supporting you in your own play-style. I'll say the combat is really fun, grinding monsters and slaying ash-born has never been more fun. Crafting outfits, weapons, items, etc... Its sort've like Monster Hunter, but more laid back. And very anime. Love the cutscenes, (mostly the anime ones :>) I especially love the character development and the story.

I still enjoy the gameplay and had a good time trying out all the weapons and their burst arts.
Costumes are a bit lacking but costumes are in the update road map so I'll wait and see what they add.
I had fun fighting almost all of the new Aragami they added, except for one but with the amount they added that's fine.
My biggest criticism would probably be how much they cut back on abilities, kinda wish I could go for crazy minmax stuff still.
I haven't had any issues with online yet, so that's good.  In GE2 sometimes my friends and I would get infinite loading screens.
Had a lot of fun so far in the assault missions, never knew I wanted 8 man boss fights till now.
I really enjoyed being able to move my camera in the hub area and look around, small thing but it's nice.

The mechanics and aesthetics are improved and it is overall a fun game as always, but lacks content atm and has a weak story and not enough variety in gameplay. Onto the review:

STORY: 
-I like the cast. However, the plot, character development, and world building as it stands is weak in comparison to Burst/Resurrection, which imho has the best story in the series. If you play GE for story, then either you have to have pretty low standards or not care all that much, because you will be disappointed. Again, the game will be given DLC for the story for free, so there will surely be a 2nd season at some point that hopefully tries to at least remedy my issues with it. Til then, the story and characters suck. 

-The main problems stem from the fact that the game does very little to show you what is actually happening in the world, resorting mostly to textbook info from the terminal to get you to speed, and providing loads of exposition dumps each time a cutscene happens. It's hard to feel the weight, tension, or sense of urgency of whatever danger or drama is occurring in this supposed post apocalyptic world when you aren't SEEING enough of it. 

-Most of the cutscenes involve the characters standing and talking in your base/office/meeting room etc. Already a bad sign for a writer. There's a war going on? People are dying? Not gonna show you, just gonna 95% tell you through a conversation. Which is a shame, because the in-game cutscenes, especially the Ufotable animated ones are indeed gorgeous when they showcase the fights and moments of tension taking place. 

-The issue spreads to the characters. As much as I like Hugo, Claire, Lulu, and the rest of the crew, they are less then cardboard cuts with next to non-existent depth compared to the previous GE cast. Again, the game tries to mask their arcs and development through constant info dumping conversations instead of ACTUALLY giving them one to make people care.

-Motives and relationships are hardly touched or challenged. Lulu for example has to deal with being cast aside by her previous group to join yours, but that issue is resolved extremely quick within like a 2 missions before she joins you with open arms. No moments to peer more into her backstory, no flashbacks to build on her past relationships with the Baran crew. Nothing. At most you get to meet her old mentor and employers near like the end of the game, and even then, the conflict there is cut short and not enough to give you something to care about. 

-Claire's ties to Gleipnir isn't shown much. Zeke suddenly just as a brother we're supposed to care about. Hugo doesn't have much to latch onto aside from his single motivation. Werner's relationship with the Governor General isn't touched on and he becomes a wasted character. And as adorable as Phym is, there isn't enough scenes of her spending individual time with the supporting cast to make you feel her connection with them. All she does is tell you towards the end of the game.

-The most dangerous antagonists in the game are just mindless Aragami, and their presence isn't even highlighted enough to make them memorable like Hannibal or Pita in GE1. The rest are asshole Gleipnir grunts or reps who are about as much a threat to you as Team Rocket grunts are in Pokemon. The moments they have leverage against your group are yet again mentioned through exposition during the end of some generic hunt mission and not shown. The threat they present is resolved quickly and most of them just end up arrested or dead within a few missions, making them about as much of a nuisance as swatting a fly. 

GRAPHICS:
-Step up from past titles which were just PSP game ports. There is more attention to detail in the world. Touches of shading, lighting, and plenty of color. The hunting areas look great, showcasing more ruin, more nature, debris, and other scattered remains of battle to really bring more life to the world, something I felt lacking in past GE games. 

-I like the character models enough, but they admittedly still look pretty dated. The aragami and god arcs look good as always. However, there barely any clothing. Luckily again, more to come in the free DLC. 

-The in-game effects are animeish as they come. If you enjoy being flashy and like seeing the screen being filled with over the top slash waves, colorful beams, and area bombing flames and lightning, then this is your game. I enjoy my flashiness, so this is a plus.

SOUND:
-Decent as other GE titles. Few tracks stand out like some of the boss themes and the classic GE theme, but the rest is just BG noise. One minor nitpick I have is that there is a certain piece of music that plays during some of the drama scenes that plays WAY TOO LOUD to the point of near drowning out the voice of the character speaking. 

-The opening theme, Stereo Future is good. Enough for me to play the  opening sequence every time I pop up the game.

GAMEPLAY:
-If you enjoy MH or hack and slash titles, there is a good amount to love. Fast game with loads of weapon parts to combine . Solo playing is viable and you get AI comrades you can bring along in groups of 4 (or 8 if you do the Assault Raids). They aren't the smartest in the bunch, but hey, you can never truly replace the boon of human teammates. At the very least you can customize the AI with stat boosts to tutor them to your needs.

-Burst Arts, while being basically a reskin of Blood Arts in GE2 are actually better. Like the latter, they add special particle effects to your attacks to pretty much make them like flashier, extend reach, and add more hits. Unlike Blood Arts though, Burst Arts look better, hit harder, and you can equip 3 or them to power up more of your moveset.

-The rest of the powerups are from control units, and the new Engage system and Accel Triggers. While some these can probably be tutored to fit a build or playstyle, I personally find them as unnecessary, but welcome fluff.

-The charge glide is easily one of the best things in the game. Speeds up chases, satisfying to hit with, keeps you in the air, and just looks badass.

-If the raw hunting and customization is to your liking, good. Sadly that is about as deep as the game gets. There is no mission variety but hunting and killing random bosses. While the arenas look better, they still aren't very dynamic as all you can do is jump all over the place and over platforms. There is very little to interact with, and they are seemingly large for no reason but to fill with enemies and generic loot. 

-There are also invisible barriers. Many times my character is capable of leaping over a fence or building to escape/chase an aragami, or grab an item yet the map blocks me from doing so. The aragami on the other hand can freely cut through map areas to escape you when they please. If there is a simple change that would make this game more fun, it would be this. Cut the barriers and allow us to parkour the map like the superhuman badasses we are. 

-Story shows god eater fights, yet no PVP or God Eater bosses. Missed opportunity to add to gameplay. Lulu, her mentor, or Werner or the soldiers would've made for memorable enemies in the story. Multiplayer could've had a faction mode where you choose to side with Gleipnir or Baran or Crimson Queen and duke it out as if you were in the war the story was hyping up. Story as a whole couldve had more replay from multiple endings where you choose to side with one of the factions as the story progresses. You couldve gotten to know the chars and the world better. Again, game has some interesting ideas, but doesn't expand on them or show them enough. 

-Bring back Predator Styles!

OVERALL 6/10 (Least till the free DLC drops)
-Pretty fun with a bit of improvement. Good if you have friends to play way with, especially for 8 man raids. Needs more content though. Hopefully the DLC is worth.",1549917516,1549920876,True,1,0,0.505300402641296387,0,True,False,False
899440,48934477,76561198246627916,0,4,8758,0,2332,1624344475,"God Eater 3 takes the core themes and mechanics from God Eater Resurrection and God Eater 2 Rage Burst and adds its own twists that makes the game incredibly fun and enjoyable all around. 

Gameplay: The core gameplay is still the same from the previous titles however, GE3 introduces new gameplay mechanics that allows better movement and more options to devour the gods that plague the world. 
-With the introduction of the Shield Dive that allows you to jump at great length, it opens up many options when it comes to dodging, traversing, and hunting. Since you use your shield to dive forward, you are also defending making this move safer than most. However, it will not protect you against strong and devouring attacks and it takes a good chunk of your stamina so its best to not abuse it as it will leave you open. It is worth mentioning that as long as you are locked onto an enemy, you will automatically dive into the enemy so if you're trying to get away from the enemy it is best to unlock first.
- Burst Arts are the new special moves that replace Blood arts from GE2RB. Unlike the Blood Arts, to use Burst Arts you must be in burst mode so devouring enemies is highly suggested. You will gain access to Bust Arts and other buffs as long as you are in level 1 burst. In GE2RB you could only equip one Blood Art and in GE3 you can equip 3 Burst Art. One for ground attacks, one for aerial attacks, and one for side-step attacks. Burst Arts give you far more options when it comes to attacks and encourages you to be stay in burst mode to access the arts and gain additional buffs.
-Devouring has been improved from GE2RB but it does not compare to the devouring system (Predator style) from GE Resurrection. GE3 allows you to perform devours in the air but that is the extent to what has been added to GE3. GE Resurrection gave you the ability to customize the way you can perform a devour and what kind of buffs you gain from it. In GE2RB you could only perform a quick and charged devour. At the very least, GE3 allows you to perform devour in the air which makes it the safest option when it comes to devouring. When performing a devour on a aragami in the previous titles, you would gain an enemy bullet which allowed you to shoot a special bullet based on the enemy you have performed devour on. GE3 no longer gives you an enemy bullet and only gives you the link bullet which allows you to give and raise burst levels to your teammates.
-Engage system links you with a party member both of you will automatically give each other buffs and share the burst meter. Sharing the burst meter is extremely beneficial since you can shoot link bullets to your linked party member and raise their burst level thus raising your own burst level. Engaging with a party member whenever is possible is highly recommended since you'll get additional buffs and the ability to enter to burst level 3.

Story: The story follows somewhat a similar format from the previous titles. Your created character is basically the chosen one of this story. Your character has a unique power that makes you stand out from the rest of the god eaters. You'll meet fellow god eaters that fill a specific character archetype but have their own unique characteristics to them. While you and your team face dangerous monster, you will also face government officials with their own agendas that threaten humanity's chances of survival. Along the way you'll encounter an anomaly or catalyst that the story will be centered around. While the formula isn't new, it is still enjoyable to go through. The characters are likable, the world is interesting, and the story is just anime fun.

Graphics and Music: I don't know enough to get all technical so I'll be simple with this section. The art style is still the same as the previous titles but with improved visuals and graphics. Music is great with some good remixes of previous tracks from the older games. However, in default settings, the music tends to get louder than it should be in some cutscenes so you might want to mess with the music and sound in the settings. Other than that, music and graphics are pretty good.

The game is a lot of fun and improves on a lot of things from the previous games. I highly recommend it to long time fans and for new comers, you don't need to play the previous games. While this is a sequel it does not rely heavily on story elements from the older titles. Every game you start with a new (created) character with their own story just set in the same world. It is game people shouldn't sleep on. Finally the game seems to have less content to the other titles but Bandia has announced they'll constantly update game adding new missions and stuff and it seems they'll be free updates/DLC. 

To newcomers and older fans, I recommend this game. Its a lot fun and you'll have a good time overall.

It has taken the best of both GE2RB and GER and combined them, while fixing several issues with the previous games. Examples of this is GER's quick devours, GE2RB's Blood Arts, now called Burst Arts, and nerfing of the custom bullet system by removing the infinite supply (so get working bullet makers, find me a bullet that will take out a target in one shot). They also added color changing for accessories, which I love because now the extensions are actually useful on non-blonde characters.

You will see several reviews complaining about the Keyboard and Mouse being impossible to play with. This is completely false, outside of the mouse acceleration (which isn't that bad, it just takes getting used to), the controls are no different from GE2RB and GER. Do not trust the system requirements, my specs are supposedly below minimum, but it feels as smooth as butter on my PC on high settings. If you can run GE2RB, you can probably run GE3, as outside of environment graphics, nothing has changed majorly.

Tthe game hits a major difficulty spike when you enter Rank 4 missions, so I suggest a lot of practicing before you hit this point, this way dodging and blocking become almost second nature. The new aragami do tend to have attacks that you cannot dodge, so get used to using Shift+E more often than just E.

pros:
-smooth and exciting battle
-cool weapon and battle system
-cool monster
-unusual equipment system
-all story mission can be played in multiplayer mode
-have 8 players raid
-can create your wife

cons:
-not really hard to beat a monster in story mode (easy af if you play with your friends)
-not attractive plot (not gonna spoil but really seems like MS Gundam: Iron-Blood Orphans)
-8 players raid is matched with random people, the only way to play with friends in raid is to press ""queue"" at the same time
-ugly and lazy costume design (at least not really good)
-lack of end game content, feel a bit empty after beat the game
-too expensive

Actually there are more cons of this game that I have heard from the players who have played the previous series of GE. But as a game for the people who haven't tried this series, it's not bad. (I personally think, if you like MHW, you may like this game; if you like MHXX, you may not like this game.)

There is almost no challenge in multiplayer mode, you may need to change some rules to challenge yourself. Such as setting no NPC in story mission, 7 NPC in raid... 
3 more updates coming in Spring and Summer(PS4 ver.), some DLC as well, hope it will make the games better.

Overall a fun game if you loved the previous God Eaters just a bit lacking at the moment content wise because this is not a rage burst ultimate BBQ edition yet. If I understand correctly there will be free DLC down the line though.
It however does greatly expand on the core gameplay of the previous titles.

The new weapons are really fun and you can actually change how each weapon plays by changing Burst Arts to change up moves. I for one really like changing my oversized Chakram into a giant Chainsaw-Axe mid dodge. I also transformed the normal chainsaw attack into a typical Greatsword charge that explodes on impact because i can already chainsaw from dodge with added bonuses. And if that is how deep only one weapon goes after investing 10 hours into it and trying out different styles, I can't wait to see all the other alternatives i can do with the other weapons.

Definetly looking forward to more of it. This game is easily worth a few hundred hours. Just desperetly needs more polish for the few unfortunate souls that have problems running it with unexplainable soundbugs and crashes on systems that could normally handle it.

It is not required to play the first two though certain things will make more sense and you will understand the references a bit better.  Combat is pretty solid, though the game doesn't seem quite as challenging as some of the content of earlier titles, notably being a bit more forgiving with respawns though it bears noting that this is as a series veteran and only up to chapter 5's end as of the posting of this review.  The assault missions time attack is of course an exception to this, and feels very satisfying to successfully complete.

- There are sometimes troubles with it forcibly selecting your internal graphics processor over your graphics card, so be sure and set it manually in the graphics card manager to use the gpu only.  If you're getting crashes as you load in and soforth try setting your graphics card to prioritize performance in the same menu as well as turning on fxaa in the GPU's settings under either the game itself or on global settings, as these solved that issue for me.

 - The story is charming, and without giving away plot points of this or earlier titles I will note that it does a good job of having you empathize with the plight of the main characters.  There were moments I thought one or two people needed a good smack, and certainly a few funny ones as well as those moments which were so sweet and adorable that one may suspect one's self of contracting diabetes.  (In particular, when you get Phym use an emote while they are around.  They mimic you and it's fucking adorable if you'll pardon my french.)

 - TLDR: If you like JRPG's, enjoy action combat, a good story, and like to customize the appearance of your player character then this game is for you.  Heartily recommend trying the earlier titles as well to newcomers of the series as they are also on steam.

This is going to be a painful review for me to post just like the one I did regarding Monster Hunter World. However, This one has a larger issue as with Monster Hunter World it could be fixed easily. 

Here is a summary of my review:

This is going to be a painful review for me to post just like the one I did regarding Monster Hunter World. However, This one has a larger issue as with Monster Hunter World it could be fixed easily. For God Eater 3 the problem would in a sense require an overhaul of the game which Bandai Namco won't have done especially from the people who developed God Eater 3.

The final score I have to give God Eater 3 is a  4.93/10 (49.3%) as while it performs better it left much to be desired. The worst offender of the game is that they barely mention any information from previous games like Bias Factor other than the Database if it is even there. While this game can be fun to people who are already fans of the franchise it is a bad starting point for those getting into the series. If people are interested in this game I would recommend getting God Eater 2 (comes with the first God Eater game) on Steam or God Eater 1 & 2 on PS4 if you truly want to play this. Grab the mentioned games on a sale (not full price) and play them. If you love the older games you’ll love this game. God Eater 3 should only be bought if it is on sale of a minimum of 50% off it’s current price. I am a major fan of the God Eater franchise and God Eater 3 let me down. This game created the impossible as I thought that it had to have a better launch than Monster Hunter World if God Eater 3 had solid Multiplayer support. To me they are on par with each other at launch. I will need to give Monster Hunter World another try to see if it can beat this score that God Eater 3 got. Performance was the biggest issue to Monster Hunter World and if that is resolved then I will need to update my review on it. The aim of this review is that you can acquire all the information that is put out there and even play a demo but it still won’t show the true story on a game. I am glad that I knew what to expect going into the game so this didn’t hit me as hard as others (including the person I played God Eater 3 with).

How was God Eater 3 released for sale in an alpha or beta state? There was no quality control done with this game.",1549774194,1549822877,False,1,1,0.347177416086196899,0,True,False,False

Pros :
- New weapons and arts.
- New storyline (did not need to review old game to follow up).
- serve many fetishes for every people who likes them.
- boobs physics with better graphics compared to previous games ( and of course, many others physics).

Cons:
- input button reaction speed reduced (yes, character seems slower compared with previous games).
- No underboobs, at least until I played now (at least you can see Kigurumi doll in womans' room, oh and you can see cat in director's room).

so after 20+ hours on this game i decided to write a short review on it.

GE3 is basically GE2RB and GER but more improved with more content and made on a better engine, there is even new Aragami types and new areas for a fresh new experience. The new Ash Aragami can get kinda annoying at times but that's just how hunting games like this are. once you learn their attack patterns they are pretty easy to handle honestly. the combat is so much more faster paced compared to the older titles which is great.

Game runs capped at 60 fps and doesn't currently support ultrawide resolutions, but it has good mouse and keyboard support and the ost is great too.

I have not finish the story of the game yet but so far, this game is definetly an improvement of their previous tittle. 
From the graphic, the design of the characters are all improved. Thou I was hoping our CaC have their own voice to talk with other characters instead being a silent Hero...

For God Eater Fans, All I can say this game is worth the money. If you love God Eater Anime/games, then you will love this game. They remove the sliding mechanic from their previous game for no reason...they should have kept that.

Like Bandai previous games, there are certain bugs in the game, like how I cannot go to assault mode with party on for some reason. 

If you have God Eater Rage Burst 2, then you need to get this game for its 20% discount.

2. Graphics are much much much better on pc than console on top with running over 60 fps.

2. keybindings are impossible. for example you can not two keybind like shift+E and Ctrl+E it isnt possible to do a two key keybind. 

would i recommend this game at full price at it current state? no, crash every so often is going to ruin you immersion and you would get pass a game without crashing after every mission.

I'll still recommend getting it if money isn't an issue, but there are definitely some shoddy aspects in the game I don't expect to find in a full scale 60$ game.

1. Control scheme is super wonky and a bit busted. You can rebind, but certain things just don't make sense. I.E. Dash and loot being the same button. Why? its a troll job...you try to pick something up and you end up dashing 10 feet in front of it.

2. The game is missing real weight behind your attacks. Whether your coming down with a big Buster sword or blasting with a laser cannon. The enemies seem un-phased until they sporadically get knocked down. Again it's not game breaking, but for a 60$ title I expect mechanics to feel crisp and polished. 

3. queueing up for multiplayer is a bit convoluted. Requiring you to change your download region on steam to meet up with friends was what I was told to do. Should be way more streamlined given technology these days and again that AAA price tag.

4. Personal opinion, but Silent protagonist in the story......can't we move beyond that in story telling? you customize everything on your character including their voice, but they can't even script out dialogue for the story? It really breaks immersion. I understand time constraints for devs, but this isn't some early access F2P or 15$ game. You're charging us as a AAA title (Even pricier in some respects given it's a PC game which usually only go for 50$)

What I can say is I definitely recommend this game. The amount of depth is incredible and there's a lot of variables so you can totally build your own fighting style There's character customization so you can create your own character as well.

There's an interesting story which you can pay as much or as little attention to as you want. Character development ala the best JRPGs with really interesting characters that again you can talk to them and learn about them or you can just ignore them and go do missions.

The battle engine is both easy and challenging. As someone who never played one of these games before, I was worried it would be punishing like Dark Souls - it is not. It is challenging but you can also get by to a point with hacking and slashing away. There's online features as well as co-op if your friend buys the game. I know it just came out, so hopefully more people will level up and start playing.

III.) Good Japanese Character Voices, tons of character customization from Dressing up, Weapon / skill customization etc.

Feels similar yet different from the original GE Series, nevetheless something good for GE fans or even new comers.

Only thing is a slight lag in weapon swapping & reset camera while using PS3 controller. Its not game breaking, just feels a little lag like 2 secs or so.

If you use controller from Nacon or any other brand, there are community discussions full of solutions!]

From someone who played GE, GE Burst, GE Resurrection, GE2 Rage Burst. This game won't dissapoint you gameplay-wise.
Does it recycle stuff from the previous games? Yes, it's their formula but they tweak it (GE2 Rage Burst being it's weakest in my opinion). 

Is it the same game but different graphics, story and monsters? Just like any sequel, it follows a formula with different tweaks on the gameplay and awhole different story. On the previous game you start from a mere member to rank up in your organization/company. Here it takes a turn to the left and start as a prisoner. Obviously, for someone who haven't played previous games won't understand the story at all. (If you're willing to play through the previous games, start on GE Resurrection, skip GE2 Rage Burst). They changed lots of the graphics and the controls are still the same but adding 2 new features ""Acceleration Trigger"" & ""Engage"", also revamping Blood Arts into Burst Arts.

TL;DR: The gameplay is good, the story scales up as you play and so does the difficulty. The controls are god awful and you must do voodoo tricks to make Controller work with the Steam controller support and steam's launcher, Bandai fix that please. Also, Amy is best girl.

- Optimization : no problems, it's not a port actuallly and it shows, not a single frame drop in any situation, no DRM, perfect controller support, well i may be thinking since vesperia that Bamco is beginning to put some efforts on their PC titles.

- Tutorial : Quicker than previous opus iirc, which is a good thing, by that i mean you can craft more items earlier, and accessing the more subtiles parts (custom bullet, class modules ... ) are also quick to come, i feel that the designers wanted to avoid the too long traditionnal introduction before ""getting into"" the game here.

- Pace : Here i'm a little surprised , i played Toukiden i considered the most fast paced of the genre, now either the 60fps effect or they tweaked the combat (aerial etc...) but GE3 is by far the most nervous action game i played (i must say also i always play either in MHW , Toukiden , or here now with Dual Blades which are often the fastest weapons so, also impression can come from here didn't tried heavy moon/sword yet)

- Graphics : If there is a neat improvement this time over the 2 first as it's designed for PC and PS4 , especially the models (chars, NPC, Monsters) which are impressive, the background and texture quality (floor etc...) is still as bad , less bad than before but i guess devs didn't bothered too much; they could, a bit at least u_u

- Game system overall :
  
Stuff-Arts : there are new weapons (Heavy moon, which is a semi circular heavy weapon , Biting edge aka the dual swords, which can transform into a single lance, like star wars double saber, and the Ray gun , a range weapon i wanted for a long time in this game since it's basically a laser that does more damage with time (heavy on OP consumption).
That's now 8 weapon with blade arts for melee and bullets customisation , this is far enough to bring diversity in combat preferences. Tutorial (and database) are here to backup the player for movesets or understand how it works however for advanced bullet crafting if you are interested and never played a GE game, don't hesitate to check forums for that.

Missions : still the same hub concept, except that you are ""exploring a map"", there are training (optionnal) missions which are clearly here to get stuff pieces or experience before next main mission, some classic monsters are coming back with a bunch of new ones but i'm not far enough.

To summarize on game system : more or less the same than before in terms of missions/crafting etc (loading times on PC are helping a bit tho, almost instant loadings on a SSD. like 4-5s at most to get in mission)

Story & charactes : Not far enough yet , but seems somewhat your classic story , ally characters are okay (no underboobs for Alisa lovers but Claire cleavage instead, plus your boss, the giant megane class female type (by giant, not the sunglasses i mean n_n' ) as for ennemies npc, we'll see.

Also no GE3 ""rage burst"" coming or whatever in the future, only updates and DLC with maybe a complete edition later included all but at least , so not waiting for a potential 1.5 remake is a good thing. JP voices are a nice addition.

Overall : it's a recommendation ,  i'm surprised to play it more than expected for now, as this genre fits more portable devices with short mission sessions.

PS : Gimme back God and Man (vocal) song (even if a BGM is inspired of it here) and it will be perfect.",1549726590,1549726934,True,14,1,0.630420863628387451,0,True,False,False

It does supports 4k! graphics are O.K. they're way better then GE2 but still is the same like the art style / direction is the same so you wont be seeing much improvement in terms of graphics it is GE2 with more eye candy.

Gameplay tho, man the gameplay is AMAZING! it is GE resurrection but way better! and the morphing dual swords are really cool! aside from that it's good old god eater.

And it is with excitement that I announce this third entry in the series is really good, it's God Eater 2 in HD with a better balance in weapons.
What I mean by weapon balance is the fact that you can't waltz through the game with custom bullets anymore (yes it was fun, but it was also game breaking in the first and second entry). They are still here but you can only use a limited amount of custom bullets per mission, and that is rarely enough to kill the target, forcing you to play melee weapons, and that's makes battles more exciting.
The story is still very good, enjoyable even if you didn't play the previous games, the music going with it is still very good, and the characters are very good too (Phym is sooooo cute (I think the fact I'm a father alter my judgement on this XD)).
The bestiary is very large too. Can't wait to see what end game looks like, I'm not worried :3.
All in all, if you love God Eater, this entry is the best of the series in HD.

So lets start!

1.Story
It seems that for this game, the devs decided to retire pretty much everyone from the previous games and make it even more darker, as a player, u start off as an Adaptive God Eater(AGE of short) who is kept in a cell with others AGE's  to be used and abused to gather materials from the Ashlands, a new massive area that has spawned and kills almost everything it comes in contact with and is harvested by companies called Ports for profit.
U escape after things go wrong and get picked up by a caravan and then the story really starts!!

2.Gameplay
Fighting is pretty much the same as in previous titles, with melee combat being at the center and ranged mainly against airial or very large targets.
Burst mode is very inportant this time around for u need it to use Burst Arts, the successor of GE2's Blood Arts and some of the other systems u get.
The 3 new weapons that were added(heavy moon,Biting Edge and the Ray Gun) more then make up for the loss of the Blast gun with the 2 melee weapons actually being able to transform into different weapons!
Bullit crafting is back as well and is almost the same exept that custom bullets have an actually limit how many times u can fire them(so don't miss!) per mission.
The other new systems make the game alot more fun and unique but might be to much for a controller since there are at least 3 more things one needs to be able to activate in the heat of combat so Mouse and keyboard is what i recommend(and works great!)for this game.

3. The Aragami.(monsters)
There are ALOT new Aragami in this installement with some of the older ones mixed in as well, of note are the Ash Aragami, giant big monsters who can do Devour attacks just like u complete with burst mode while crippling u in the progress, making facing them even more of a challenge yet never dull!
Breaking an enemies Bonds(weak points) is once again essencial but this time u can (if u want) get some help from the game on where to aim, wich comes in quite handy but must be manually configured on the options menu(game even tells u itsself lol!)
To get the most out of the Aragami getting the best score for a mission gives u more rewards so on the higher difficulty u will need to grind for the materials u need to craft new weapons.
But hey, thats part of the game's charm, and who does't mind beating up some monsters??

4. Graphics
in 1 word, Mindblowing.
It just looks so good compared to the other titles in the series altrough i think it could have done better in some areas like character design and indoor areas(like the Crawler) since they still look rather blocky at times and compared to current generation games could be way better without breaking the anime style that is its signature.
Outdoor area's on the other hand look breathtaking with great viewing distance and attention to detail like area materials being highlighted by pillars of light so that u don't miss to pick them up and waterfalls far away in mountain maps.

5.Sound
The game's sound is once again top notch, especially the english translation that sounds clear and clearly done by pro's.
Combat can be rather chaotic sometimes with the cries of your companions sometimes drowning out the everything else.
My main complaint soundwise is that your character STILL is treated as if he/she is a mute who can't talk in cutscenes and has others do the talking for him,wich should not be needed.
After all, if your character can talk in combat why not everywhere else??? 

6. Multiplayer
I have't tried it out yet but it seems u can play it with 8 ppl(wich is a first for the series) and is not Peer to Peer like in previous titles, however it still seems to be regionlocked(wich u thankfully can bypass with Steam by changing your region) wich is a shame, u would think that the devs would know better by now in this day and age...

Verdict.
9,5.
Its a great game that really pulls u in with the great story and fast combat but could have been much better considering its 2019 and while its fighting mechanics are solid it seems its very primitive in other parts, like your MC being unable to talk in cutscenes(only nod and smile) and regionlocking still being used for multiplayer is something that shows some of the devs still think its 2014 and are not keeping up with the times.
But if u can live with that(like me) u will have the time of your Life!!!

PS: For monster Hunter fans, think of this game as MHW with a focus on speed,story and crafting but without being limited to 1 weapon or constrained by time.

Compared to the previous 2 the combat feels a lot smoother to me, and the changes to the custom bullet system (they have a separate ammo while regular bullets use OP) means that I don't feel like I [i]have[/i] to use some crazy custom bullets. The time-to-kill is lower all around which makes the earlier parts of the game feel a bit too easy in my opinion but I'm sure it'll be appreciated in harder fights.

[list]
[*]Combat feels great and fluid, especially with stuff like the dive move added in and faster running speed than previous games
[*]Graphics look very nice overall
[*]Characters are interesting, story so far has been better than the previous games at least for me
[*]Custom bullets don't rule the game but are still useful
[*]Great deal of customization of combat through the burst arts
[*]Free updates upcoming that will add much more content
[/list]
[h1][u]Cons[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*]Lighting is a bit weird in game compared to the character creator, especially making light hair look almost glowing in game at times and making skin look much darker than in the character creator when in shadows but not making hair similarly dark
[*]Doesn't seem to be decent anisotropic filtering, added some in through nvidia however
[*]Lower time to kill means the early game feels pretty easy
[*]Less freedom to make ultra overpowered custom bullets if that was something you were looking forwards to
[*]Some goofy stuff with changing the controls, such as guard maintaining its original buttons even if you remap it
[/list]

Final thing I felt like mentioning is for name and codename in game I would recommend going with your character's first name with the first letter capitalized for your name, and same name but all undercase for your codename. This is how the rest of the characters have their names and codenames set up despite the default name and codename for your character not following that pattern.

I was a fan of the god eater anime, and own the god eater games  but never got too into them. The gameplay is fun, on controller. The M+KB is awful, really, really awful. The biggest issue with M+KB? The sensitivity settings. Sorry, but what game doesn't give you direct control of your sensitivity? In this game, there are only markers for sensitivity, such as ""Slow, fast, faster, slower"" ect, it's not a good system, if you're too fast on ""Slow"" but the jump from ""slow"" to ""slower"" is too much, you're just SoL. DPI doesn't change anything for it either. You'll see comments saying ""change your DPI"", but it legitimately does not work in this game. I have two settings built in my mouse, one with 1600 DPI (My normal setting) and one with 600 DPI, my CSGO setting. Anyone familiar with DPI knows how huge of a slow down 1000 DPI causes. It doesn't effect this game.

Issue number 2 : It offers you to play at 144HZ, but doesn't allow you to adjust the frame rate higher than 60, meaning 144HZ is 100% pointless. 144hz only works if you get 144hz frame rate, any developer should know this, don't know why they included different HZ when they don't allow you to actually use the right frame rate for them.

Issue 3 : The combat is fairly clunky, definitely not polished to monster hunter standards atleast, but that should be expected and this is more a warning to those who come from MH. 

Positive : I'm sure many people will play with japanese voices, but for once, the English voices aren't that bad. They don't sound like they were randomly hired people off the street, which is pretty rare for games like these. 

The game play is fun on controller, but if you're looking to use M+KB you'll either be lucky and like the sensitivity they force you into, or you won't. The keybinds for keyboard in my opinion also aren't that great, I feel like binding multiple things to stuff can be somewhat annoying, but thats just me. 

I'm hoping they patch the sensitivity and just give us a slider, or someone finds the CFG for this game so we can hard change it ourselves, i would prefer to play on MKB but at the moment that's not a fun option for me.",1549702790,1549702790,False,38,16,0.487450629472732544,0,True,False,False

Changes compared to God Eater 2 Rage Burst:

- The Blast Gun has been removed. It has been replaced by the Ray Gun. 

- Customized Bullets are limited use now, but can be used on any gun. 

- Burst Arts take the place of Blood Arts from GE2. There are other bonuses and mechanics to fit the AGE theme and aesthetic.

- The Bullet Editor has been rebalanced. Because this is not GE2, Blood Bullets are not a part of the game.

- Multiple weapons have been buffed up for better usability, such as the Buster Blade and Variant Scythe.

- Aragami ""feeding"" has been changed. Aragami will now go to specific points on the map where 'feeding grounds' are located. Standing on top of a feeding ground while it is active replenishes HP and OP for your character as well.

- You can quick devour without leading with a normal attack now.

- The practice range is no longer restricted to bullet testing. You can now test melee weapons.

- Shield Charging is a new maneuver which closes gaps much faster than Steps. 



Verdict: Without spoiling the story, gameplay has received a lot of polish to the formula. The game is also considerably harder than Rage Burst was as everything in this game is sped up. For those who want to enjoy the story, the story is there and it's easy to follow without prior knowledge of other God Eater titles, though prior knowledge does help.

    God Eater 3 is an up-rezed port of a PSP game so mediocre, that often times not even the Japanese dub matches the lip sync. Which is an insane statement, considering it is made for current generation consoles, and PC.
 It attempts to ape Monster Hunter, but does so in a manner so poor, that not even the most desperate fan would choose this game.
 Maps contain a single zone. ""Gathering points"" are a single item drop that is in the same location every time. Monsters are simple, repetitive, and when the bigger aragami started showing up, it only added having to disengage from the fight entirely every now and again while the monster flailed moronically, to the process.
 There's no depth to the combat, not even with the addition the special acceleration drives or whatever the game called it. It's bloated with crafting and tutorials for skills that are so meaningless, I can't even recall their name as the game is attempting to teach me them.
The game keeps talking about a lock on feature, but nowhere is the game telling me how to lock on, not even in the control options.

 It makes Monster Hunter 1 for PlayStation 2, look like Monster Hunter World by comparison.

This is awesome.
I mean it's the same game at its heart, but it looks and feels so much better.
... ok the camera is weird. It's, like, stupid fast and its kinda disorienting at first (and slow speed is a fucking crawl so that's worse), but you get used to it. Honestly, with how often the Aragami move around you, barreling your puny human body out of the way the fast camera can actually be a bit useful when trying to get back in the fight.
Beyond that, everything feels so much more fluid. The combat no longer has that clunky, weighty movement to it and instead is quick with some real momentum. The game does a great job of giving the player all the necessary stuff right from the beginning (I spent a little while wondering when i was going to be able to change weapons until i realized there was literally a terminal in the corner i could have used sense the first mission). 
The graphics are a huge step up. The characters are fun but they also suffer from my one major gripe so far:
It's all SUPER EDGEY
Like, holy shit, how edgey can you get. Everything has a slightly darker tone than any of the other God Eaters (and that's saying something). Zeke is 100% just Romeo put through a Kingdom Hearts filter....That being said, I love him.
So yeah, TLDR: its a good God Eater. Like, really good. Apparently there are bugs; I haven't experienced them, maybe I'm just lucky.

I have played god eater since the release in PSP which is God Eater burst. And I have played Monster hunter since Monster Hunter freedomunite which is also in PSP. God Eater is Not Monster Hunter. I played both and I loved them, especially God Eater 3 and Monster Hunter World. 

God Eater 3 is really fun, the characters are superb, they have their own personalities and it makes a good waifus and husbandos (weeb XD). The gameplay is not what I expected, I thought it would be more like the old god eater with additional skills and the 2 new weapons. It feels fast and just really fun to use the flying mechanics thing (I forgot the name). 

Now the cons, the old weapons still feels old.

Pros:
Good old anime edgy plot you know and love (so far)
Main character voices in dub  vastly improved from prior games.
Controls aren't actually shit, they've been polished and the new dash mechanic makes moving arround much easier.
AFAIG the enemy repetition is not as severe as in previous games.
(some enemies and weapons are back but had a rework to make them HD)

Cons:
Mouse acceleration 
No 21:9 support (borderless picks up the resolution just fine, but displays black bars on the sides, fucking up screenshots and such, a patch is in the works but it's not ready yet).
Every character design has been sponsored by Flex Tape (that includes most of your clothing).

Overall, if you're looking for a fast-paced, heavily customizable monster hunting experience with some anime plot on the side and more Flex Tape any human can handle, buy this.

-About the port: It runs very smooth and with no issues, the camera is a bit to fast but outside that, no problems.

Gameplay feel a lot more fast paced that GE2 where sometimes combat feel too slow, new mechanics such as dive, engage are a welcome addition and make thing even better. Graphics are way better and very good, my only minor issue is light in a few spot look to bright, but this is a very minor issue. Character customization is great, there is enough options, most for hair, face and eyes, along with accessories and clothes.

Whats nice is that you are able to dash long distances across the map making navigation a lot easier. There's also 8 man missions which further spices things up.

So, I've managed to find a fix for my game specifically, I'm not sure about others, but I'll just post it as I did here if you're running an Nvidia GPU and are having crashes at loading screens:

Go to your Nvidia Inspector if you can access it > Manage 3D settings > Program settings > ge3.exe > Enable Antialiasing FXAA if it's disabled and this should fix the crashes that occur at loading screens

Now that we're past that, I can say the game is worth buying if you have the other God Eater games and you take advantage of the current Lunar New Year sale so you can get $18 off of the game or whatever amount 20% + the Lunar New Year deal gives you, if you haven't used the deal already.

What I like about the game:
Graphics (I've already expected it to the look like this, since it's what the previous games of the series looked like.)
Soundtrack, sounds great as it has in previous games.
Characters, [spoiler]Must protect Shi- I mean Phym![/spoiler] I like them, they have their own quirks and such, no character is similar to another.
Combat, It feels a wee bit faster than GE:R and the addition of the new weapons, acceleration triggers, and the engage mechanic make combat more unique with new opportunities to defeat the Aragami, which have also had some new additions to their ranks in the form of Ashborns and quite a few have returned from the other games.

Graphics, sound effects, map design and gameplay. It works but it's not good enough. After 30 min I was literally bored out of my brain seeing the same claustrophobic ugly looking map and monsters. Textures are just laughable especially in the cutscenes as the camera zooms in to show how low res and blurred they are.... clipping of clothing and hair and REALLY bad character creator feels rushed and simply bad. ( 10 hairstyles, 4 faces and NO BODY modification whatsoever... no heigh, torso and leg thickness just sad. In games defence I can say that Japanese voices and overall acting is good though ).

Gameplay is just a mess with REALLY confusing and annoying CONTROL system. Blocking requires you to press dodge B ( xbox controller ) and Run ( RB )... the problem is if you want to run and then dodge you cant do that because you will start blocking.... wtf. Constantly flipping between gun/melee/burst mode LT+RT/ammo swaps/Devour ( holding Y ) makes me feel like I'm fighting the controls rather than a monster. I spent more time thinking what to do and press rather than stay focused on the monster and its attacks. Attacks feel and sound the same regardless what weapon you use ( with the difference being the lenght of animation and damage numbers ) so in the end I couldnt find the weapon I liked ! That never happened to me in the video game lol... As I have mentioned before all that button juggling will eventually result in pressing wrong combination and getting damaged which is frustrating. Add to that HORRIBLE camera that CANNOT stay LOCKED ON all the time but for some reason it just goes back to FREE mode instead of staying LOCKED wtf...

Monsters are forgettable and unrelatable ( so you will not find your favorite or you will just forget them ) their attacks are just random? So you don't know what to expect... One Aragami jumped in the air and suddenly when crashed on the ground disappeared only to attack me with a giant spike?... no visual indicator except for the ""disappearing"" so I just held the block and it worked. Some of the attacks seems to be elemental and create for example earth spikes that shows like for literaly 1 SEC have no VISUAL indicator that the monster is going to use them so it means you will get hit.

For a game that prides itself in faster combat it sure is slow. The best thing you can do is to hit monster 1-2 times and then block as soon as you see it move... ( chances are its using EITHER badly displayed AOE attack or just COMBO... yes they can attack in combos ) When you have a lot of small enemies you will get hit by ranged attacks of said enemies because there is no indicator off screen that shows ""bullet"" or attack coming... so yeah cheap stuff like that is really annoying.

The only kinda positive thing I can say is that the story is presented in an OK way... reminded me of Valkyria Chronicles ( where you had character development and stories ) so the story is a bit more fleshed out than in the other games in the genre.

No actual useful armors ( except for cosmetic outfits ) is also a deal breaker for me. 

Couldn't find a multiplayer lobby ( well I did but they were passworded :( ) and most likely the game will have small player base just like Toukiden 2 or GE 2.... 

For the asking price of 49.99 I DO NOT RECOMMEND this mediocre game.... 25 is the maximum I would be willing to invest but then again I did not enjoy it so I'm getting a refund. 

Have you noticed that I never compared this game to MHW? Because they can't be compared ( MHW would win in every category and its worth the asking price ). Those games are different but somethings like GFX, Sound, Story, Fun Factor, Monster Design etc. can be judged on how good they are.... and like I have mentioned before GE 3 feels last gen at best.",1549641465,1549641465,False,18,13,0.381258219480514526,0,True,False,False

It's a lot of fun, and it seems like the best in the series, even if it doesn't push too many boundaries with this latest iteration.

Quick note: there is -some- continuity between GE1,2,&3- but it's fairly minor and you can easily pick up 3 without ever touching 1 & 2. Though I'll admit you can get both for 20 bucks or less on steam, so if you like 3 you might as well pick up those too.

Plot & Characters
So far the story is pretty generic. Silent, largely emotionless God Eater protagonist learns the ropes, kills Aragami, makes friends, reveals hidden powers that set them apart, tackles more emergencies, rinse repeat till the game is done. It's pretty standard faire anime stuff and falls for some of the standard pitfalls rather quickly.

Gameplay
Compared to the previous games, God Eater 3 is a lot faster paced, leading to shorter windows of opportunity to get a hit in, but lower enemy health to compensate. I'll admit I haven't gone past rank 4 so far, but from what I've experienced the battles feel a lot smoother, and even the traditionally tankier Aragami go down fairly fast as long as you know what you're doing and don't charge in flailing blindly.

 Visuals
God Eater 3 looks alright as it is the first in the series to be made exclusively for modern platforms. While this doesn't mean it looks nearly as good as most modern games, it also doesn't look like a HD port of a PSP game. The Aragami got the brunt of the benefit, and look really good if you can get them to stand still long enough to look at them. 

The character models look decent, but have this weird thing where they're all covered in black tape for some unknown reason. So far I've encountered no in-game explanation for why they have so much tape in so many seemingly arbitrary places, so I'm assuming it's just a collective insanity brought on by the Ash. 

Unfortunately, the environments still look pretty bland, but they're 10x less bland than the old brown lumps of GE1 at least.

Music & Sound
The soundtrack is really good, and it was almost a shame to turn it down so I could hear the NPC's chatter over it in the midst of battle. There's also a fair bit less vocal tracks, which I rather enjoyed since they got a bit repetitive in previous titles.

Bugs
I will admit, there do seem to be some performance issues and bugs, so be wary if you do pick GE3 up. I had no trouble setting up a multiplayer match, but my co-op buddy froze mid-mission after some frame rate issues, so we decided to go solo for a while, which is a shame, but it's a ton of fun solo so neither of us were terribly upset.

All-in-all, I had a blast with my first 6 hours of the game, and can't wait to spend a goofy amount of time trying to unravel the mysteries of the tape-deco apocalypse over the course of the rest of the God Eater 3.",1549624015,1549624015,True,2,0,0.50188678503036499,0,True,False,False

The previous God Eaters were developed for the Vita, and ported to PC as HD-remixes. But, this one was developed for the PS4 and PC, and it shows; being the best looking in the franchise. But, it does lack ultra-widescreen support on PC, and it bares some rather typical Bandi Namco faults in it's simplistic settings. If you have a PC built with hardware from the past three or four years, it should run okay. Also, the game comes with no DRM outside Steam, itself. A rarity in this day and age.

That said, you don't really need to have played the previous games as the story isn't connected outside the setting. This game does have a 'database' to help fill you in on why this post apocalyptic world is in chaos, but it doesn't spoil or explain any of the previous games in detail. 

Something to note, though;The third installment is very... VERY unapologetically fan-servicey. Prepare to watch many cutscenes where the camera spends the whole time focusing on a characters chest (Even going out of the way as to cut out much of the characters face), or slowly climbing up skirts. It's that kind of anime. So, just be prepared to play with the mentality of a thirteen year-old.

From the limited time I've played with M/KB, it plays okayish. Though, as many have already stated, sensitivity is janky with no way to fine tune it to your exact preferences unless your mouse has it's own built-in DPI adjustments. The game also uses mouse acceleration, and you cannot switch that off. So if that's something that bothers you, you're better off using a controller, if the game interests you.

The game can be played from beginning to end solo or multiplayer. As you progress, the game opens more characters for you to bring along if you're a solo player, and you customize many abilities for each one to tailor to your playstyle. There are also some mechanics in singleplayer that aren't available in co-op unless you bring an NPC along. In multiplayer mode, as you'd see in Monster Hunter, aragami will have more HP and break-points will take more hits to sever. The game has a built in match making menu, which you can use to filter specific game options or set passwords and invite friends with.

If you're one who really enjoys the boss-rush style genre and you can tolerate some frequent, cringey anime tropes, God Eater 3 is a good play through.",1549619026,1549619670,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Monster Hunter except fast paced + anime i.e. The Nioh of Monster Hunter just as Nioh is the Nioh of Dark Souls (much faster game)
- Doesn't have the repetitive resource gathering like Monster Hunter but still has complex customization like Monster Hunter; instead when you beat a mission you just get the items.
- Custom Characters maker that actually looks good.
- Addictive gameplay and story; heavily voice acted.
- Not a port, built for PC this time. Runs great.
- 144 fps (much higher than PS4) + ultra graphics and still runs smooth on gtx 1060.
- Online multiplayer that works well.
- Long game 60+ hours. 
- Great combat. Bunch of fighting styles/weapons/customization etc. 
- Works flawelessly with PS4 controller or other controller.

Cons: 

- Camera takes some getting used to, can be finicky in corners. 
- With all the customization, terms, and things to learn (if you've never played a God Eater game), can be overwhelming at first.

[*]Deep crafting, upgrading, and extensive play-style optimization
[*]The story setup is engaging

[*]Aragami are extremely detailed (and they look incredible)

Negatives:
[list]
[*]English voice actors did their best, but the script falls short
[*]Some of the textures (check out keyboards in this game) are full-on PS1 mode
[*]Another hub with multiple loading transitions and unclear chat requirements (causing you to run around trying to find the person you're ""supposed"" to talk to)

+Good and stable 60 frames on high settings. (i5-7600k and 1060 GTX)
+Key bindings for both keyboard and controller.
+English dub is serviceable, but you can switch the voice to Japanese.
+Character Customization is decent, gets better as you progress. Note, of your character features, you can only switch hairstyle, hair color, and your accessories after character creation. I don't doubt you could find a way to change this though.
+Animations are much smoother and fluid than the previous God Eaters. It feels like a next-gen God Eater especially with more fluid and fast combat
+All previous weapons are back plus more. They're all honestly great and you can try them all out easily enough. As you use them, you get more custom moves.
+Custom Bullets bbeeeeee
+Multiplayer seems to be working well, but still peer to peer. You'll probably disconnect if your host/clients are too far away. Otherwise, it looks to be better off than GE 1 and 2's netcode on PC when playing with more than 1 other person, which in those games has still yet to be fixed.
+Playing with Controller is great. So great, it's recommended. Because Mouse sucks.
+Personally, the game is stable for me so far. Other's have mentioned it crashes. Note, the game may be using a weaker graphics card for you if you have a laptop. You may also want to update your drivers.
+No Denuvo

Cons:
- Camera Control with Mouse is awful. It's like Monster Hunter World's Mouse Support before they fixed it. It's either too slow or too fast.
- Locked at 60hz, no Ultra-wide support, and I personally can't find the .ini file myself to modify any other graphical or control settings other than using what's there in Nvidia Control Panel.
- Seems to have some issues with some users regarding random crashes and low frame rate for some. Your mileage may vary from me greatly, but note you can refund within 2 hours if you must.

Overall, it's a great port. It works, and works well. Graphically much better than the previous GE. It's your waifu af Monster Hunter genre-type game that has a much faster pace combat, lots of customization, lots of cutscenes, and edgy weapons. Fully co-op in story campaign, but also solo-able. 

It's absolutely worth the price tag if you're into the hunting genre and the aesthetic and combat pleases you. Even better if you have friends.

The Story is (so far) way more compelling. Instead of ""Big monster is going to an island. OwO i wonder why?"" We get ""You're a genetically altered slave to a prejudicial state in a post apocalyptic world that could wipe said state off the map in an instant. Go fight demons to not die."" Characters are better too. Very anime, sure, but they actually do stuff and have real personalities and dont just sit at a table with a book all day.

The Gameplay (so far) is way more fun. Mind you, in MHW i found myself using the S&S because it was the only class that could change directions while attacking. That said, it seems most weapons are controlable, and you wont be stopping 60% of your combos to reposition yourself. Multidirectional dashing, jump attacks, and Shield-lunging, make combat fluid, fast, and fun.

The graphics are... fine, i think. It doesnt have bloomy lighting like MHW so much, and its clearly going for the anime style. it doesnt look like anything you couldnt really downsize to the Vita, but at the same time it looks good enough that im not staring at any graphical issue. The character design is a wide difference too, because thanks to your clothes being cosmetic as opposed to tied to stats, your character will look as fashionable as you choose, which is nice because this game is less ashamed of anime tiddy than MHW (as far as im aware, it doesnt have nudity, but it does have skin tight clothes a jiggle physics, so enjoy modding it) so if you like female character armor that isnt bulky Trump Border-walls glued to your character just barely showing midriff, you're in luck.

Its fun. I like it. Will update after i get more than 2 hours in.",1549597849,1549597849,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False

Second problem is character control. Playing on PC (mouse + keyboard) is a nightmare. To use some skills you need to press (for example) Up arrow + space + shift + E + whatever more.... yes good luck doing it when you have 0.2 sec for reaction during fight.
I do not recommend if you are looking for multiplayer game. I just watched at least 10 different streams and everybody plays solo. It looks like ""multiplayer"" is missinformation.
