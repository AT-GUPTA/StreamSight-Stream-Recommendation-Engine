Game is alright gameplay-wise, Story is seriously bad. Though one great factor is the fact you can mod it a lot, like Minecraft or Terraria if that’s up your valley.

There's no real sense of progression. Sure you'll upgrade your armour and weapons and move to a higher tier of environment, but all the enemies, all the tactics and frankly all the environments remain the same from start to finish. At hour 1 you're wandering the surface of a planet, using a spear to stab guys with guns. At hour 2 you're wandering the surface of a ""higher tier"" planet and the guys with guns take more spear stabs, then at hour 3 you have a better spear and the guys with guns take the same number of stabs as they did at hour 1. It's progression of a sort but leaves a lot to be desired.

Everything is easy. But that doesn't make it quick. The whole game feels like one fetch quest after another. Maybe you like the idea of being a bounty hunter at first, but then you realise that the loop is just ""fly to planet > find guy with gun > kill guy with gun (easy) > fly back"" repeated again and again. It doesn't change. There are no hard fights.

Too much of the game feels like errands and busywork. You're ready for the next ""leader"" bounty mission... but it doesn't unlock until you spend an hour flying from planet to planet killing low level minions that pose no challenge. You're ready for the next story boss... but you can't face them until you've explored the surface of a bunch of harmless planets first.

And then you kill a story boss and... nothing changes. I haven't faced the T4 boss yet, but even so, I know what will happen after.
I'll get a mission to explore some T5 planets.
I'll go to one and automatically die due to it being too hot/cold/slimy.
I'll craft a heat/cold/slime repellent backpack.
I'll go to the T5 planet again. Now it doesn't kill me.
I'll fight one or two familiar enemies I've fought before but with higher stats.
I'll dig into the center of the planet and mine out the T5 resource. This will not be hard. The environment will be the same.
I'll make the T5 armour. I'll use whatever T5 weapon I found in a chest on the surface of some harmless planet, or maybe just the T5 weapons that dropped from the T4 boss.
I'll fight the guys again. Now they feel exactly like the T4 enemies from an hour ago.
I'll spend and hour exploring harmless planets looking for monkey/bird/lizard culture to scan. Mostly I'll run through familiar villages spam clicking the things and people until I'm told I can fight the T5 boss.
I'll unlock and fight the T5 boss. It will be easy.
I'll start again from line 1. Increment tier, change colour to ""mauve"" and it's sea-people now.

I can't help but entertain a certain cynicism...

Mechs (not a part of main game) are GRINDY and boring, and throw the balance of main game out of the window sometimes.

[b] What i enjoyed a LOT: [/b] 
- Artstyle (cute)
- Game's lore and whole metauniverse is well-developed and opens up gradually
- Good main quest line progression
- Playstyle variability (Mining, Shooting-Looting, Farming, Villaging, or Subquests)
- Rich plarformer mechanics (Jump/Jet/Blink/Dash/Sprint/Grappling Hook/Sticky Ball)
- Rich fighting system (one-handed weapons and items can be combined, two-handed weapons have SPECIAL MOVES which are really cool)
- Side-content scattered around the world, is rather detailed
- Collectables - usually i'd dislike them, but in this game they feel actually interesting to seek out (cooking, pokemon-like catching, unique items), and aren't forced.
- Cool easter eggs and references!

[b] What i was okay about: [/b]
- It's about space but there's not a lot of ""space"" stuff happening. Your ship is just a cool personalizeable hub that's linked to player, with overworld map built in.

[b] What i didn't like (but that's okay)[/b]
- The whole universe is evenly populated and easily predictable. this makes game's world feel oversaturated and fake (at least on second or third playthrough). Planets either are completely barren (literal sandboxes), or are guaranteed to contain a few outposts and a few dungeons. [spoiler]There are no ""city"" planets like we see in the intro.[/spoiler] Some places that should at least feel special and unique, are rather common after some further exploration. However, i get why it's made that way - purely for fun factor. It's a sandboxy platformy crafty game after all.
- While overall soundtrack is very good and really fits the game, it gets repetitive after a while due to game's pacing. And barren planets music gets boring after a first loop or so.

[b] What i didn't like[/b]
- The mech progression is painfully slow and grindy, unlike the whole other game.
- Mechs feel too OP for the main game, like they should show up way after where they are.
- The whole game progression is artificially slowed down by the need to craft or loot, but it is still relatively easy to overlevel your character and fly past certain areas and skip some content. Although on the other hand, it may be good for replayability.
- There are some mechanics that make it really easy to abuse the game with no skill required. Spoiler:

Starbound can be compared to similar games, such as Terraria, but is usually rendered as below such. In my opinion, from experience, I would say that Starbound has way more potential than Terraria. A marvelous idea, but with a slightly lesser-quality execution than expected. The one thing I enjoy the most about Starbound is its modding community, which is the only thing keeping the game alive as of right now. Some of the more major mods fit the theme of the game more than the game itself, and sometimes feel like more time and effort was put into them, especially in terms of sound and visual design. In conclusion, I would give Starbound a solid 8/10.",1615659847,1708661613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

CHAPTER 1: The Happy Times
My tale begins at the beta stages of this seemingly promising game, when the ugly design choices and painful gameplay pacing was balanced with an interesting and challenging gameplay structure that offered what felt like endless possibilities. Little by little, there was more content, fun mods, and a very solid multiplayer system. All in all, Starbound was on the up and up. It had survival mechanics, biomes, deep character development and a slowly growing backstory. I had a lot of fun playing it with friends and enjoying the satisfying gameplay loop of visiting other planets, finding cool stuff, and then bringing it back to our ever growing base full of memories and personal touches that added to a cool player made narrative. 

And I can pinpoint the exact moment when everything went to shit. 

Chapter II: The Exact Moment When Everything Went To Shit
At some point, there was a patch. This patch proceeded to break everyone's mods, as is the telltale sign of crappy game developers (seriously, it's actually quite easy to preserve people's mods through various workarounds as far as modern computing goes). 

See, up until this point, Starbound had a great gameplay mechanic that made the world feel more grounded. Namely, temperature. A realtime temperature system that required you to manage heat as an environmental resource. This resulted in gameplay that rewarded a slower crawl, and made you value your upgrades and spatial management. It was a fantastic feature because of how it really stimulated your creative problem solving skills. But then, a dark shadow loomed over the horizon... namely, focus groups. 

First, they came for the temperature system, but I said nothing, since I wasn't registered on the Starbound forum. Then they began to nerf the ship building, the biomes and little by little, the game was slowly being refurbished into a linear experience full of contrivances and shoehorned plot elements. Now you had to meet boolean requirements to do stuff, and the creativity was dead. All in an effort to appease idiots who like casual games on their horrible phones and tablets. 

Chapter III: Conclusion
Obviously the warning signs were always there. The artstyle clearly speaks to a sort of primordial force of stupidity in its patronising efforts to constantly look cutesy in an upbeat corporate dystopia sort of way. Like it was made by a marketing team rather than real humans, and how it was driven by mass appeal rather than anything one could respect as dignified creative impulses. 

And if you don't think this game was designed for idiots, then keep in mind that the combat features both health bars AND floating damage numbers. Even people who write ""L"" and ""R"" at the bottom of their shoes would find that patronising.

This game had promise, and it was a lot of fun. But in the end, it became yet another piece of mass produced garbage intended to placate the emotional needs of people who, in a just world, ought to spend a few years in a re-education camp brushing up on things like critical thinking and self-awareness before being allowed anywhere near a human civilisation. 

All in all I think this game speaks to the darker impulses of the human condition, and I believe future historians will find its timeline as a useful reference point in figuring out where the NATO countries' equivalent of the Caligula years began to crop up.",1708606916,1708607090,False,7,0,0.515514731407165527,0,True,False,False

The infinite universe you're given to explore feels hollow and lifeless once you've been to every type of planet and seen each type of town, and the gameplay gets very loop-y and repetitive. I will admit that building is nice, but there are better games if that's what if you're after.
Ignore my hours- most of them are from heavily modded gameplay, and even then in retrospect it probably wasn't worth my time.

Smacking a linear story on a game meant to be about choosing your own path in the universe is a questionable choice. Said story's not horrible, at least, but I genuinely feel like some of the stuff from beta was better, with different PC's having different backgrounds instead of everything being homogenized into a single plot.

Planets each only have a single biome and the two monsters you might find on one of them are just mix-matched versions of the same enemies you've encountered a hundred times already. They may as well just be biomes of a single infinite world, there is no practical difference.

Starbound is a game that doesn't know what it wants to be. It wants to put a heavy focus on having crazy boss fights like Terraria. At the same time, it wants to focus on being an open-world sandbox with infinite exploration and creativity like Minecraft. Meanwhile, it really wants to focus on having an engaging space story with unexpected twists. So how does manage all of this?

I feel that I want to try different survival craft games that I can play in my low end machine. I saw this game being recommended because of being similar to terraria, many said this is terraria but in space. I bought and check it out, the game  felt different because it more focus on story progression, and exploring so it might have less boss fights.

After spending 18 hours, the game is ASS. performance was shit I'm playing in single player alone, and it felt that I'm playing on a multiplayer. Hitting an enemy have a delay and it messed up my movement, they get hit and I moved closer so I can hit it again but i get hit, they get knocked back in few seconds after I hit them. blocks appear in few seconds after placing, making it hard to block enemies to have time to heal or escape.

The doesn't have quick controls, its hard to move stuff from inventory to storage. I have to pull an item instead of holding control or shift to instantly put the items on the storage.

The underground is boring. After exploring the first and second planet the underground is the same. you barely get any loots its the same amount you get from storage structures in the surface. 

Overall 18 hours experience was shit. this is my opinion on the game, I haven't checked game that much because I give up playing. look more info about this game online. game is dead, slaver, lost potential yada yada.

to you who's reading this buy the game, experience it and suffer for yourself.
who gives a shit on a opinion nowadays. JUST BUY THE FUCKING GAME. (its better to buy it while in discount :D)

I found out today that when transferring PC's I had accidentally deleted my main character file in this game. 
Which is a weird way to start a review, but maybe, it's a chance to reflect on that character, a Novakid named Captain Orio, and I'll let that speak for itself...
Significant spoilers ahead:

In my time as Captain Orio, I have...
 - Made my living as a small farmer
 - Crafted an awesome cowboy hat, which I would wear through the rest of the game
 - Explored the most inhospitable planets the galaxy had to offer, just to say I did it
 - Put together a motley crew, of every species imaginable
 - Become the galaxy's Chosen One, finding and reuniting the heavily guarded artifacts of every species
 - Beat up a mean tentacle planet
 - Created a history museum filled with artifacts from my journeys
 - Become a Space Policeman and rid the galaxy of all manner of criminals

This game taught me to beat bosses harder than I ever thought I could. I have seen landscapes and skies more beautiful than I could have imagined from a pixel-art game. My 127 hours as Captain Orio have been filled the joy of discovery, and the satisfaction of perseverance. ""I applaud your tenacious moxie in the pursuite of complex goals"" - I have this quote from the shipboard AI written above my real-life desk, because it's just stuck with me...
There is no feeling quite like the first time you find yourself gunning through a radioactive alien landscape with Curtis Schweitzer's ""Inviolate"" setting the pace... Or the first time you watch the aurora borealis break through the clouds in the unfamiliar sky over a remote frozen world...
""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe... Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion... I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate...""

So long, Captain Orio, and thanks for all the memories. 
Time to put another 127 hours into a new captain.

What makes it even more special is that it marks my first-ever online game purchase. I was a little kid finally able to use a credit card for online purchases, and Starbound was the perfect choice.

This game won me over with its captivating story, enjoyable gameplay, and the wonderful music by Curtis Schweitzer. It kept me coming back for more, and I've completed the main story over 5 times. The exploration of these worlds, each with its unique charm, provided a captivating experience.

Curtis Schweitzer's music deserves special mention; it's not just a soundtrack but the perfect background that enhances the excitement and fun in every moment of the game.

Diving into Starbound always brings about a sense of comfort and relaxation. There's something about the game that just makes me feel good, and part of it is undoubtedly the nostalgic vibe it carries. It's like a delightful trip back in time, and who wouldn't want to relive some of those cherished moments?

In its own unique way, Starbound taps into that sentiment, delivering a gaming experience that goes beyond mere entertainment – it has always been a comforting escape for me. It's a rare gem that manages to capture the essence of why I play games in the first place.

A massive thank you is in order, not only to Curtis Schweitzer for the phenomenal music but also to the entire Chucklefish team for creating this immersive universe. Starbound, you're more than just a game; you're my personal time machine, consistently providing that warm and feel-good escape.

- You can fly a spaceship to different planets, build stuff on them, harvest resources, and discover neat stuff.
- Lots of cool ideas that are implemented reasonably well (minus all the cut beta content)
- It's like Terraria, but with more sci-fi stuff. If that's your bag, it's a decent solo experience.

The bad:
- Dated design that was ""abandoned"" (finished development) nearly a decade ago. Multiplayer is not stable enough for me.
- Runs on one CPU core for both clients and dedicated servers, meaning performance can be a mixed bag. Doesn't engage the GPU for calculations, and won't ever.
- Better content diversity and progression with mods, but struggles to maintain sync in certain areas when running the most popular mod (Frackin' Universe) on a dedicated server with resources to spare—again, engine limitations are the culprit.

The ugly:
- Will likely never see an engine update to bring it up to speed with modern or continously updated titles
- Troubleshooting bugs is a nightmare with mods because many vanilla bugs still remain, and telling them apart can be tedious or a dead end
- Really no reason to play it over Terraria apart from the space aesthetic since the maps it generates for planets aren't special in any way, just the same jumble of random dungeons and blocks vomited onto the appropriate biomes. In Terraria, you can walk left or right to do the same thing that Starbound requires you to fly a spaceship for.

In short, Starbound was a very ambitious idea that partially delivered on its promise. Unfortunately, after nearly a decade since its ""full release,"" it's far behind the times. Titles like Minecraft and Terraria continue to refine and innovate on everything from performance to content, but Starbound was declared ""finished"" and left to collect dust.

The game is better with mods, no doubt. Frackin' Universe, among others, add a layer of much-needed depth and incremental progression. But running these mods on a game engine that can only command a single CPU core—and it only runs on the CPU, using the GPU for nothing but displaying pixels—is a recipe for frustration.

Starbound is a beloved game to many. Simply rifling through the many Discord servers dedicated to its most popular mods will tell you the lengths people are willing to go to breathe some new life into it.

-its not fun, its not enjoyable, the quests are terrible...like they are really bad.

-its repetative, the story became utter anti-roleplay garbage, you cant join different factions, you are supposed to be the good goy, fight alongside them and not kill the said good goys which they made almost impossible to kill.

-lots of content/story/lore is either cut, unimplemented or removed for no reason whatsoever, which the game really suffered from, especially with race uniqnuess and less planet diversity and life form diversity which is very important in a game like starbound so most planets feel similiar if not the same.

As the days past in game, the hours stretched IRL... Alongside my adventurer friend, we explored the stars, the cute, vibrant universe full of beauty. The characters we met were all nuts, maneater plants, smart axolotl, robots stuck in ages past, energy lifeform cowboys, buccaneer penguins... Every sprite, pixel physics decision allowed us to build a simple and perfect bubble in which to live and explore and discover and love. 
And when we had seen everything there was to see, we downloaded Frackin Universe. And we added 100 mods. And the possibilities became endless. Sadly, as we explored further the matrix space, the game became frayed around the edges. Our perfect bubble was to full, ready to burst from the creations we filled it with. Our base, our castle in the sky, our rabbit hole from Alice's Wonderland... It became too much for the reality of the code. The more we wanted from this game, the less it could take it. The sun rose and set, the winds of change blew over our lives... The dream could not last. It was too much, too beautiful, too heavy. 


Came a moment where we had to accept that this game had taken us as far as it could. And now our great creation, our imagination, our friendship and adventures are forever frozen in time - in a perfect bubble of happiness. 

I am thankful to have known this game above so many others. This game has a soul. This game could be so much more. My wish upon a star: let this game revive, let it be born again, let the community create more mods, let the adventure continue.

To me, Starbound is Terraria, but with better combat, better aesthetics, more to explore, and a story to follow.
At least, that's how I'd describe it if I were wanting to paint it in the best possible light.

Truth is, there's merit to all of those statements, but there's also too much holding it back from actually being loved in the same way Terraria is.

I don't really want to leave a (bigger) wall of text getting into the intricacies of what I mean by that, so instead I'll just highlight my biggest 2 issues with the game.

1: Boss Encounters.
As with Terraria, Starbound progression involves pushing through various boss fights. It's more story-locked than progression-locked, but it amounts to the same concept, more or less. Unfortunately, every single one is incredibly underwhelming. There are no actual Difficulty options in Starbound, just settings that change how much Death matters and if Survival Mechanics exist. So what you get is what you're stuck with. Basically, it comes down to the fact that the fights largely don't offer a ""dance"" to learn. You're not trying and trying again to get the mechanics down to handle the boss appropriately. You just hit it, and if you eat a laser to the face or whatever, you mash a Bandage, repeat until victory. It's all very straightforward and undertuned, which makes the combat I enjoy a lot more than Terraria's mostly irrelevant, because you never have to properly use it to win. You can flail around and be totally fine. Starbound, even with its boss encounters, is notably easier than even Classic Mode in Terraria.

2. Story.
The Story is something added fairly late in Starbound's development. Pretty much the last thing added before launching as 1.0, IIRC. It doesn't NEED to exist, but because it does, I have opinions on it. Namely, it feels like an afterthought, and because of that, I wonder why they bothered at all. It leaves me with nothing but negative opinions, whereas if there were no Story, it'd just be about the exploration and power/boss progression, which would have been fine. The TL;DR is this: BBEG shows up, we talk to Exposition Girl, who has us go and SCAN different objects and then run a related Boss Dungeon... 4 times in a row. Then we collect some MacGuffins to go kill the BBEG - The End. It's as basic as basic can be, and the associated gameplay is roughly 40% ""find this randomly generated structure that could be anywhere and just scan everything in it"", which is INCREDIBLY un-fun to me. That, and as already mentioned, the bosses are not engaging, and therefore don't add much to the dungeons they reside in.

At the end of the day, I still recommend Starbound. It's a decent game. I honestly do enjoy the moment-to-moment gameplay & combat more than I do in Terraria. I honestly do think it looks significantly better. As a result of that, I also have a lot more interest in building things in Starbound. I'm still more likely to boot up Starbound than I am Terraria. So of course I'm going to recommend it.

But the moments that SHOULD be capstones all fall flat, and a game like this needs to have those moments work, otherwise it makes the whole thing feel a lot more mundane, and that's basically what's happened with Starbound.

Thankfully, there IS a decent modding scene here, and for the most part it's all accessible via the Steam Workshop. There's a few pretty large ""expansion"" style Addons available, tons of Race addons, tons of weapon addons, some mechanical overhauls, Music, QoL, and comprehensive compilations like Frackin Universe. There's enough good stuff in there to help build around the solid core that Starbound has that it's definitely worth looking into if the Vanilla experience feels ""close"" but not quite there to you.",1705289065,1705549694,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The base game is extremely whelming (not tried modded at this time) and it wasn't the best or the worst i've ever tried. ""better with friends"" although sometimes it can be a laggy mess with all the effects going off at once. One thing i did notice is that your character difficulty is persistent in multiplayer, which means if you picked casual and everyone else picked survival, you wont need to eat while all your friends have to carry a kitchen/campfire/microwave to make food to survive which is pretty entertaining if you're on the casual side and an impressive immersive experience i haven't seen in any other game where you're usually pretty much railroaded into the difficulty of however the server settings were made.

i had a decent time but its extremely bland after a while and nothing really differentiates the exploration of a planet other than what type of defensive backpack you have on and maybe some environmental dangers on the surface and maybe some mixing of mini biomes underground; and the hazard of nearly dying if you forget you're on a dangerous planet and accidentally remove your backpack to use the bright one because you forgot you were on a dangerous planet. Since they seem so similar to other safer planets (no UI icon or otherwise constant info that ""its dangerous to take your backpack off"") until you remove it and get penalized

the combat is mildly interesting with the energy usage for guns/staffs/launchers but shoehorns you into having a switch weapon for melee or using throwables like javelins or bombs since most guns without the higher tier energy bonuses or an energy boosting food will drain you pretty quickly. Staves are a good solution to this since they use metered amounts and you can regen the lost energy quickly but aren't useful in tight spaces where the top of the staff/wand is blocked as it wont trigger the attack and you waste 2 seconds charging for it to fail the cast. The delay before using weapons is also strange, since melee should be able to start swinging instantly but the cooldown of the weapons triggers when you swap to it, so you're standing there awkwardly for a second before you're able to start fighting/defending after a switch, and the delay for swapping to javelins is especially noticeable 

You progress thru tiers pretty quickly so by the time you have a set of lower tier gear you can easily replace it for the next gear tier or even skip a tier and keep linearly progressing until you reach the end, which comes way too quickly imo. Its similar to terraria or minecraft where you COULD get a set of silver armor, or you could just go get plat and go from there but the small amount of choice for higher tier armors is very limited and there's no real side-grade options. The difficulty of the planet factors how much damage you take and do to mobs, so unless you're good at dodging stuff and build fighting anything that can't phase thru walls its easier to  just stick with following the upgrade path so you dont get turned into an oil spot instantly

Its possible to go your entire playthru without ever using a space station as its pretty annoying to set up and by the time you get materials to make one you like, it may be irrelevant and not much use other than a hub to grow stuff at if you're not on casual difficulty unless you did a lot of early game titanium grinding and went to asteroids to mine copper/gold which a first-timer may not know about without combing the wiki for these specifics

I also don't know why the game is so afraid of letting you earn money since you get 1/5 the price of everything you sell and it doesn't get any better than that aside from using the terramart container to sell food, which only increases the value of each part of the dish by a few pixels and isn't worth the time to make the more complicated stuff to sell

it was 100% worth the $7 i gave it since i did get a few hours of entertainment out of it, but that's about it for this until i give the mod a try sometime in the future",1705016379,1705016583,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is great with mods, but the vanilla game is sorely lacking since it tries to add too much and most of that is half finished. Also unpaid child labor is a thing.

[h1]Main Review[/h1]

To start off, I have about 300 hours invested into this game and enjoyed it a lot. But about 250 of them are from mods like Frackin' Universe which is basically a [b]""Minecraft Tekkit"" or ""Terarria: Calamity mod""[/b] type expansion mod which adds an astronomical amount of content to the game and expands (and finishes) a lot of the half finished content that is a part of the vanilla game. [b]This review will be mostly for the vanilla game.[/b]

Its pretty enjoyable for the first beginning hours of the game, but it quickly becomes a repetitive ""scan the world"" fest.

[b]A lot of the content in the vanilla game feels half finished:[/b]

[*]The colony building feels more like a small side thing that gives you a small amount of extra pixels(this games currency) and doesn't really benefit you very much

[*]The radiant quests (randomly generated quests) feel sooo lackluster, and its the only way to recruit more crew members

[*]Space stations seem pretty useless and are extremely expensive to build

[*]The whole story is kinda meh, especially when you have to scan random household objects to progress the bar. This felt very lazy imo and got dull really quick which is why I've only completed the story [b]once[/b] out of the 300 hours I've played this.

I personally wouldn't recommend the vanilla version of this game, it's a game that's packed with a lot of content; the caveat  being that a lot of the ""content"" that its packed with feels unfinished. If you do decide to get it however, I would highly suggest downloading Frackin' Universe before you even play this game on the steam workshop.",1652574220,1704828719,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

211820,155030920,76561198155358713,0,10,8014,0,7478,1707139870,"Ah, Starbound... Think of it as you being compared to your brilliant cousin, that is Terraria, but you told your parents that you wanted to be an astrophysicist, not a best-seller fantasy novel writer. The difference being, Terraria fulfilled, or even surpassed, its parents expectations. While you, Starbound, are potentially stunted because you had to do odd jobs here and there, and kind of missed all the things that's required for you to be an aspiring astrophysicist.

Positive things:
• Starbound's art direction is visually pleasing. Thematically on point, and I have no qualms on the visual department. I like the pixel art, I like the ambiances, I like how they portray space and its inhabitants.
• Simple narrative to follow, nothing too convoluted. It's much easier to digest or follow compared to its cousin. You're a Protectorate graduate, who just happened to have a sh*t luck. You begin your adventure with basically nothing but your matter manipulator. And you're kind of free to do whatever you want from the get go.
• The music! Oh my God, the music! Curtis Schweitzer has absolutely made Starbound even grander that it should have been. Without his music, exploring barren planets would be boring as hell. The sound department is also on point!
• The space is vast, random, and there are like more than thousands of planets to explore, with unique items, inhabitants, dungeons, and quests. This is where, I think, Starbound has the upper hand. The variety satisfies my thirst of exploring. And if you're considering mods, Frackin' Universe is one of the best to enhance your experience.
• It's a sandbox game, you do whatever you want. You want to be a space-faring adventurer? Fine. You want to settle down on a red planet with cute critters? Fine. You want to be a landlord and collecting payments from NPCs who stay at your accommodations? Suit yourself. You want to explore Glitch Castle to relinquish the crown? Cool. Or you want to go to a speakeasy that's filled with sadistic penguins as regular patrons? Go for it. Or you just want to destroy a planet because you don't like the colour of the dirt? Do it.
• So many decorative items to [strike]steal[/strike] collect! Use your matter manipulator to mine or copy them. You can also 3D print most of the furniture that you have encountered.
• You can recruit NPCs as your crew member once you beat and spare them, or complete quests from them. They could help you in battle, as additional firepower or someone who could buff or heal you.
• The ship customisation! My dream of having my own space ship and designate a room for my crew members to hangout with pinball machine, soda machine, car beds. I could even lease some of my rooms in my space ship to NPCs.
• The puzzles in dungeons are quite fun, the boss battles are simplistic but also fun too.
• Similar to Terraria, your friend could drop in and drop out very easy in this game when playing multiplayer.

Negative things:
• I don't know where to start, but a wasted potential is one of the glaring issues that I found in Starbound. This game could have been Chucklefish's own flagship Terraria-like. The basic stuffs are there, the lore are there, the mechanics are there. The game sorely needs support like how Re-Logic supported Terraria.
• Some of the side quests feel fetchy, and that is the nature of randomly-generated quests.
• This game sorely needs more variety.
• If you have explored the game for more than 40-50 hours, you will feel that you have seen everything the game has to offer.
• If you're coming from Terraria, this game would feel like a downgrade, not a side-grade.

I have to highlight I loved the game in itself, not being compared to Terraria, but the similarities are there to be compared, and that's natural. I don't really like Terraria that much, I loved the progression, but always wishing Starbound had more care like Terraria is. I hope Chucklefish would revisit this game or make a sequel to it while addressing the issues that made Starbound feel inferior to its competitors.

Do I recommend this game? It depends. Yes, if you haven't played Terraria and looking for a sandbox metroidvania exploration game. No, if you have played Terraria. Also, don't forget to check out Frackin' Universe as soon as you beat the story, as this mod enhances the gameplay and the variety.",1704167084,1704784600,True,69,3,0.859216392040252686,0,True,False,False

Clunky and unwieldy combat.
Controlling the character feels bad.
Absolute garbage UI.
Bad performance considering what the game is and how it looks.
Game constantly feels like it's on the brink of falling apart.
Built and hyped on the legacy of a much better game.
Has an unfinished, forever early-access feel to it.
Overpromised and underdelivered.
Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle.
Obnoxious inventory management.
Filled to the brim with trash items.
Illusion of depth by throwing quantity at the player rather than quality and drip-feeding even the most basic game progression.
Terrible writing.
God-awful quest design.
Endless fetch quests.
Main quests suck, but you NEED to do them to unlock a lot of basic things in the game.
Constant thought of ""oh man, I hope this gets better later on..."".
Meaningless exploration.
Most planets are extremely flat, empty, ugly, boring, repetitive and completely devoid of interesting landmarks. Not to mention single biomes for the entire planet.
Land on a planet, then walk forward mindlessly for 3 minutes to find the POI (which will most likely be a recycled outpost you've already seen a dozen times before).
Wasted potential.
""That's it?!"" moment when you finally complete every single hand-crafted and progress-blocking quests and side quests.
Fundamentally broken.
Extremely defensive fans that mostly refuse to acknowledge the game's shortcomings.
""But mods can fix it!"". 
""You just gotta make your own fun out of it!"".
""But the ship customization is good!"".
""It gets good after X hours! Trust me!"".
""Why did you even play it for X hours if you didn't enjoy it?!"".
""If you didn't enjoy it, then it's not meant for you!"".

To give credit where it is due, it's still more impressive than Starfield by virtue of being both an indie game and a much older title.

And if you do like the game, good for you! Keep enjoying it! For me it is and will always be one of the biggest disappointments I've ever had in gaming. ",1602020088,1704733466,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I looked and looked, when I hit ten I discovered a supposed ""download"" for the game. I had no idea Steam existed and so: I downloaded it.

Yeah, my journey with Starbound started by pirating it so. Not the best start. When I grew a little more and discovered Steam, it was probably one of the first few things to go in my cart. I was ecstatic to play it again, and lord did I play it.

The gameplay loop of Starbound is very easy to follow:
[list]
[*] Land your ship on a new planet (after you go through the tutorial quest and the first ""main story"" dungeon to get your ship running).
[*] Walk all the way to the left or the right in a search for settlements/dungeons OR immediately dig down if you used your ship to check what ores/gems are here for your progression.
[*] Explore and collect resources, no doubt for the next tier of item so that you can boost your stats higher.
[*] Prepare to search for ""clues"" as to the next civilization; search for clues; complete the next story dungeon.
[*] Move up to the next danger tier of planets.
[/list]

Now, this is well and good. But there's a few flaws with Starbound that really take that same gameplay loop and make it largely unsatisfying. And you may ask, what do I mean?

Well. Every bit of story progression is locked behind you completing some amount of action. You can't progress your armor and workstations without going out to a [generally] more dangerous planet in order to collect new resources. Now, imagine, for just a second, that every step of the story is locked behind around thirty minutes to two hours of just searching planets and doing nothing else of substance: that's where my problem lies.

The story is very slow progressing. You go between huge bursts of the plot via dungeons and then immediately get blocked from more because you haven't scanned the 10th item you need and have to go back to another planet.

Me describing which one was the most annoying below, marked as a spoiler:
[spoiler] The Hylotl one was probably the most annoying. Hylotl rarely occupy the surfaces of planets, meaning you need to go out of your way to an oceanic planet and spend however long scouring the darkness until you happen upon one of their colonies. And a genuine tip I have for you is to put a teleporter flag inside one of those structures in case you want to come back in case you want to double check and make sure you didn't miss anything later. [/spoiler]

I should give my [most likely non] controversial opinion on this game:
The game is fun for a little while, but opening that workshop page is probably the largest dopamine hit my brain can receive. I would start the game vanilla, that is my full recommendation. But good lord, add some cosmetics I implore you.

I normally don't play the game anymore without RPG Growth, Frackin' Universe, and Frackin' Races. They add so much nuance and make your character choice actually matter. It lets you develop a playstyle and most of the classes dictate how you approach combat: from a distance or jumping towards your foe and screaming.

Just, tldr:

If you're not planning to use Workshop for this game, then treat this as a 'Not Recommended', sadly.

I want to love this game, I really do. But sadly, missed opportunity and poor design choices hinders this game from truly succeeding. Having such a rigid story in a space exploration game simply gets in the way of exploring. There is nothing to promote exploring, except for the possibility of a few unique weapons (emphasis on few). Once you own those, there is really no reason to explore most planets, as they are pretty much the same experiences with slight asset swaps.

On the other hand, there's not really much reason to stay on a planet either. You have the NPC housing system, which is a good foundation, but once again very barebones, and arguably out of place in a game focused around planet hopping. Building is good, wiring is decent and the paint system is cool.

Despite all this, however, there is heart in the game. Heart which is exposed and multiplied by the modding scene. Playing a modded session of Starbound in a group is a surprisingly fun experience.

Very relaxing, chill and immersive game. The modding community is huge and some of the mods are really cool. It's not the most action packed game so if you are looking for a game with interesting combat, don't play this game.

I don't like comparing it to Terraria (Because Starbound is actually a grounded survival game that doesn't try to be a weird hybrid survival/bullet hell game), this game is more focused on exploration and research, unlike Terraria's boss rush style of play.

Planets are all one biome, why? I understand this is probably to facilitate some kind of ""progression"" (which this game also sucks at) but it just makes for boring exploration after a while. The occasional interesting microbiome does not make up for this. Several planet types are also worthless, either being impossible to explore or very similar to other types.

The game relies too heavily on procedural generation in order to simulate the feeling of a vast universe. Most enemies you will encounter are incoherent and unmemorable, procedural weapons have boring effects.

I could keep going but it's futile as despite all of the game's problems, I do enjoy playing it [i]with mods[/i]. This game was built from the ground up to be modded and that's easily its biggest strength. Much like Minecraft, you can shape this game into something far more enjoyable for you.

Especially if you can get it on sale! The sheer amount of things you can do in Starbound is pretty cool, but that leaves it very surface level. 

I noticed a lot of the time that people compare it to Terraria and though the games feel similar, Starbound is just as quirky and fun (in my opinion) in its own unique way. While Terraria has a really fun combat mechanic and its features are more fleshed out, Starbound offers that generic ""Jack of all Trades"" vibe. 
So far I have had so much fun playing both games but single player and multiplayer. Starbound, given its narrative is a bit more linear and offers a lot of direct story telling that gives you a chance to explore the vast galaxy and accomplish many things such as building a colony, decorating your spaceship, and saving the galaxy. 

The main downside that is faced when playing is that it attempts to be that Jack of All Trades which leads to it coming off as a shallow system. Nothing is too in depth, Nothing is too bare-bones. There is genuine love crafted into this game and with the Modding Community being pretty good, there is a lot of playability if you are looking for a sandbox styled game with relative freedom to build almost anything you want. 

Overall, I have enjoyed this game for a while now and surprisingly given my mobile lifestyle, really appreciate that this game is playable on a macbook. For something that can be played in a slower paced setting it is quite fun as long as you don't get overwhelmed with the onslaught of choices that a player is given shortly after the 1-2 hour long tutorial with all the various features given.

A good game will give you an ""ocean"" to explore, something with depth to it. This game gives you many puddles. There is no depth any of those puddles. Nothing interesting to find. Nothing fun to do.

I'll bring it up again because it is the most relevant comparison; It feels like when they made this game, they wanted to capitalize on Terraria being super popular and good. But the people who made this game didn't understand WHY Terraria was good and didn't have any ideas or a plan going forward to make this game good. They just made something ""like"" Terraria without enough sense to understand the thing they were trying to copy. So this game ends up being a strange abortion of the concept.

I've also seen barely any worthwhile mods for this game, which tells you something when even modders can't make the game enjoyable. Most of the mods I've seen are simply races/species and of course sex mods. Nothing legitimately game changing or significant.

This game is probably worth it on a 75% off sale.

If you're looking for a sandbox adventure that seamlessly blends exploration, creativity, and an endless supply of quirky charm, then look no further than Starbound.

From the moment you beam down onto your first procedurally generated planet, the sense of possibility in Starbound is intoxicating. The universe is your oyster and I can attest that the depth of exploration is unparalleled. Each planet is a canvas waiting to be painted with your footprints, and the diversity of biomes and creatures keeps every discovery feeling fresh, even after hundreds of hours.

One of Starbound's standout features is its crafting system. It's a virtual playground where your imagination is the limit. I've spent countless hours designing elaborate structures, creating intricate furniture, and fashioning my own armada of starships. The game encourages creativity in a way that feels both liberating and rewarding, and my 500+ hours are a testament to the endless possibilities it offers.

The game's narrative is woven into the fabric of exploration. As I've traversed the cosmos, I've encountered mysterious ancient races, delved into forgotten dungeons, and unearthed the secrets of the universe. The overarching storyline adds a layer of depth to the seemingly boundless freedom, creating a perfect balance between guided adventure and player-driven exploration.

Starbound's pixel art style has an undeniable charm, and the soundtrack is a cosmic symphony that accompanies every jump to a new star system. The soothing melodies and upbeat tunes have become the soundtrack to my space faring escapades, enhancing the immersive experience.

Multiplayer is where Starbound truly shines. Whether embarking on daring missions together, constructing massive collaborative bases, or engaging in friendly (or not-so-friendly) PvP, the camaraderie of shared exploration elevates the game to new heights. My time with Starbound includes countless memories of laughter, triumphs, and the occasional spaceship race across the galaxy with friends.

In conclusion, Starbound is a masterpiece that has captivated my heart and imagination. It's a testament to the game's enduring appeal that each session feels like a new chapter in my cosmic saga. Whether you're a solo explorer or seeking a universe to share with friends, Starbound beckons you to dive into a vast and enchanting galaxy. Suit up, fellow travellers, and prepare for a journey that transcends gaming—it's a celestial odyssey that keeps calling me back for more.",1703688628,1703688628,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hello once again to the people who have been reading my reviews ever since 2020 (which is when I started doing reviews so many reviews)! I'm so utterly sorry to announce that this will be the final game review, I will ever make. it has been a long journey up until this point but I have been holding this game for a long time now, it is finally time to talk about a game that I hold so much love towards, way back in 2016 when I first played it...Starbound! Starbound is an open world sandbox game that was developed and published by Chucklefish in July 22, 2016. The reception was really positive with over 80,000+ reviews, which is ridiculous. Well, this is it, ladies and gentlemen, I present you, Starbound!

[b]Story:[/b] It has a lot of depth in it, you got a lot of lore in this game that it's literally too much to go over but I'll cut it short. So, the story goes like this, upon waking up, you walk to the right to find someone holding a speech, holding the main tool you use, the Matter Manipulator, when everything seems normal at first, a tentacle creature, attacks the entire place and everybody else, so you make a run for it, all the way until you reach the spaceship, as soon as you escape, you find yourself in space, alone. Upon finding a teleporter later on, in a planet that you are near. You arrive at the outpost, a place full of people, creatures, and penguins. You then find Ester Bright, who is the most important npc in the game, as you will get lore and missions to do, one must fight a bunch of bosses to prove their worthy of obtaining all of the six artifacts, as each one represents Avian, Glitch, Human, Floran, Apex, and Hylotl. After gathering all of the artifacts, we finally reach the final area of the game, where you face the creature who as been causing havoc, The Ruin. Once defeated, the universe is finally safe from harm. Holy crap, that is a lot of lore and like I said, there's more to this game, but I don't want to take up all of this review with some lore. Overall, a pretty solid story, it's not mind-blowing or some of the best stories you can find in any game but what's here, is good enough.

[b]Graphics:[/b] Ok, ok, ok, wow, this game looks downright stunning. From the title screen to the environments, It is such a pleasure to adore every single environment and detail present here, I'm blown away for how the visuals look in Starbound, this is a 2016 game, how does this game look better than any below average game I reviewed? Starbound still to this day, looks beautiful. Granted the themes are generic and nothing special but they some how make them feel unique from each other, for one, the looks give the world a different feel to it and the weather and effects it has on your character makes the themes feel not as uninspired as any generic games, you know the ones (New Super Mario Bros. Wii).

[b]Music:[/b] I have no words, this is a beautiful soundtrack. It's very calm, soothing, and pleasant on the ears. I love the soundtrack, it is my favorite.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] The gameplay of Starbound is very similar to Terraria, I know Terraria wasn't my kinda of game to play anymore but does that imply to Starbound? Not at all! Even though it's still grindy and time consuming, I find the music to help me keep on going and it doesn't feel that bad, i'd say, it's even more fun to explore in Starbound. Anyways, besides being similar to Terraria, Starbound's gameplay is really good, you explore in different worlds, fighting enemies, getting loot, and finding upgrades to your tools or ship. Your main goal is to complete a bunch of missions from npcs and fight bosses until you get the final artifact, which will lead into the final boss of the game, The Ruin. It's an interesting way of progress, you can even fight optional bosses that also net you more stuff! You have literally everything here, building, fighting, missions, the list goes on and on. I enjoy the game personally, and the fact that the workshop support can make the game a completely different experience is still fun and better since you can improve minor aspects like the crafting which normally takes a little bit of time, now, you can craft an item instantly. There is a lot of fun to be had here with both the main game and workshop support.

[b]Price:[/b] Go ahead, buy it on the retail price or on a sale if you are lucky!

[b]Verdict:[/b] Overall, Starbound has been quite a pleasant time for me! The Story is incredibly deep and solid! The graphics are amazing and still look solid to this day, despite the animation. The music is very beautiful and soul touching. The gameplay while it is repetitive is fairly fun, even with friends and the workshop support makes it all the better!

[b]Rating:[/b] 8/10

[b]The end:[/b] Hello...I never write this section in any review, but this one review is very special to me. I want to thank you and the others who have been reading my reviews, from the past to this review. It really means a lot to me, all of the time and effort really went into the ones that I put the most work into. My favorite year of doing steam reviews was 2022 along with 2023, I had the most fun making all of these reviews. I wish you and everybody else very well in life! As I have said in my introduction section, this is the final review I'll ever do. I really enjoyed my time with my reviews, granted some of them had no effort put into them but here's what I've been doing in 2023, I went back and fixed every. Signal, Review I did, so it's all updated with formatting and more detail in them. Well...this is goodbye then, I hope you enjoyed the long journey from the start, all the way to the end of my reviews, thank you for reading this review and if you have read any or all my reviews (I'd be surprised if you did), I deeply thank you in my heart, for your time. Goodbye, it was fun while it lasted...the end.",1664907216,1703550425,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the modding scene/player created content is the best part, and possibly the only good one, though most of it doesn't completely fix the game's core problems.

For example, the ""FFS"" gun mod adds some actually really good guns. They're fun to use, animated delightfully, sound nice, and about as powerful as you'd expect for a very real feeling weapon. None of this praise can be applied to any vanilla gun.

the story is bland, and it's characters dont seem to do anything other than be there and give exposition, excluding the one time where the plant and some monkey chic start playing the game for you in the last racial mission, so you can get done with it quicker

I find it really cool how this game allows you to explore a bunch of different star systems, each with their own planets, with several different planet types, random events to encounter, settlements and ruins in some planets, friendly and not-so-friendly wildlife, and busy undergroud sections full of stuff. The planets here are among the best procedurally generated worlds out there. I also like how there's some actual lore, but it's ever so slightly tongue-in-cheek in some aspects, giving the game's story sort of a Hitchhiker's Guide vibe.

I also appreciate the non-random dungeons which usually contain interesting little puzzles and platforming sections, as well as unique boss fights. Not all boss fights are great, but there are some standouts here and there. Overall, visiting dungeons in between mining and crafting is a fun pastime.

The combat is also pretty fun, combining action RPG elements with 2D twin-stick action-platforming quite well. You can't succeed on skill alone, but unless you're extremely overpowered, you also can't succeed on stats alone, so you will have to use both. I particularly enjoy just jumping arcs over enemies when they try to shoot me with guns, making them miss most shots, and then dishing out some attacks of my own in the brief period before they take out their melee weapon.

The crafting side of things is one aspect in which I think the need for mods is evident. Crafting in the base game is rather simplistic, not providing you with many possibilities in the way of automation and contraption building.

I've done basically my entire playthrough so far with the FU expansion, which I hear adds a bunch of stuff to the game, and I think it's a good choice.

Pretty enjoyable throughout the first playthrough or two if you're patient and take your time. There isn't too much to do after the main game except for building and exploring. However, there's a reason I have so many hours on this game, and it's surprisingly not because I like watching paint dry. People who say this game is boring most likely haven't modded it. This is where the game goes from ""it's okay, but it feels like it's missing something"" to ""driving the AE86 from Initial D through the defenses of an arctic military facility to rescue hostages while eurobeat is blasting through the speakers"". [b]If you're like me and love Starbound's artstyle, controls, and exploration but dislike the tediously long and repetitive story quests and find the gameplay loop boring, 100% mod it.[/b] Starbound has a ton of easy-to-manage mods on the Steam workshop (just subscribe/unsubscribe to the mods you want), many of which make the gameplay much more enjoyable and give you much more to do. Mods like Frackin Universe also add much more to do later in the game after the main story is complete, though it's important to note that Frackin in particular drastically changes the game and makes some things more tedious, but adds MUCH more content to the game (planets, dungeons, weapons/armor, quests, races/settlements, and some great soundtrack to name a few things). Basically, mods not only add more content and customization to the game, but also serve as the missing pieces to the puzzle that is Starbound feeling like a complete game, and to me that's more than enough to make this game a blast, especially with friends (note that locating people who actually still play this game is like finding Waldo in New York City).

TL;DR: Beautiful artstyle and fun exploration, but somewhat repetitive gameplay loop. Okay game overall on its own; great game with mods, not difficult to mod at all. Modding fixes most of the problems that make certain parts of the game feel boring and incomplete, and makes it MUCH more enjoyable.

You get on a planet supposedly safe and early level ? every animal is agressive and does 3 times your damage, even after crafting a few swords. You die ? there's no other checkpoint than where you spawn from your ship. You go the other way ? you get one shot by ninja snipers out of nowhere. And good luck remembering on which planet you received this random fetch quest.

I love finding a village on a planet and running around doing quests in hopes of recruiting someone to my crew (the florans are my favorite). Every time I start a new character I remember why I enjoy this game so much.

The core gameplay loop is simple: explore your planet, mine, upgrade your gear, move to a more dangerous star, repeat. Despite it's simplicity, it never feels pointless. There's always something to work towards, whether that be making armor or upgrading your EPP, or the late game tasks, like enhancing your mech or building a space station (although that's definitely [i]late[/i] game with how expensive it is).

The NPC interactions are also simple, relegated to one line of dialogue per person. They can give quests, which reward you with items, and the potential for a new recruit. Quests have decent variety, ranging from passing notes to other villagers to baking bread. The only time I dislike the NPC interactions is when I have to run back and forth halfway across the planet to do a trade or something.

If the vanilla game gets old, the modding scene is well established. Install a few of the larger mods, and you might as well have a whole new game! I highly recommend thoroughly exploring the workshop, and/or looking online for mod lists.

I would more recommend starbound to a minecraft fan then to a terraria fan. all three share aspects, but minecraft and starbound both focus on exploring the infinite world around you, while terraria is more focused on being the most powerful you can and slaying all the bosses.

You also have hub areas to go to and action heavy missions that feel like normal video game levels.

Finished the story as a co-op with a friend and had fun with it BUT since then, I couldn't really get into it. I really wanna genuinely like it but this game is making it very difficult.

I enjoy the different aproach and a twist it has compared to Terraria and it's one of the things that's making this game great but at the same time, it feels like devs either didn't really care enough or they were forced to ship the game much earlier because while the huge potential there, it's just not it...

The story is kinda silly and the gameplay loop tied to the story becomes quickly boring (especially if you play solo), the pace is super slow and exploring, while fun, can become more of a chore than something you look forward to. The enemies and bosses feel clunky at times and the pace of fighting is also a little bit off.

I'd recommend this game mainly because it CAN be fun experience for the right people. But for most of the players, especially those coming from Terraria, be prepared to be frustrated and bored regularly.

It also doesn't help that devs pretty much abandoned the game so no content updates, no bug fixes, no QoL or performance improvement, nothing... now the game is surviving only in the hands of modders and that's just not enough in my opinion.

Com mecânicas similares a Terraria, Starbound tenta inovar colocando a uma temática diferente de geração procedural: sistemas solares e planetas gerados aleatóriamente. Mesmo trazendo uma dinâmica maior ao jogo, já que, na progressão de jogo o player não tem que necessariamente ter as mesmas experiências que teve antes, esse tipo de sistema já se mostrou ineficiente em diversos outros jogos, visto que a geração procedual é ainda pobre, irregular ou regular demais. Esse problema aparece em Starbound, com planetas que mesmo diferentes, se mostram muito similares aos outros, com as mesmas vilas/dungeons/estruturas. Na primeira gameplay, isso não fica muito evidente, mas conforme se joga mais e mais, a graça vai se perdendo, principalmente em missões da história que obrigam o player a explorar planetas do mesmo bioma a fim de realizar uma analise cultural de cada espécie (às vezes tudo o que precisa está em um planeta só, em outras, é necessário explorar outros até achar o último item).

Apesar desse problema, Starbound traz aspectos únicos, como uma variedade de raças a serem escolhidas, dimensões de desafio, maior complexidade para construção, etc.

A mediocridade aparece quando fica evidente que os inimigos, bosses, armas, itens e biomas não conseguem superar os de Terraria.

Mesmo assim, se trata de uma experiência boa para quem gosta de jogos de sobrevivência 2D.

TLDR. My Rating 7/10
Comparable to ""Terraria"" (5/10)

-Starbound is very much a sand box game
-you may choose to follow the story quests, though that is not the quickest way to get better gear
-Lots of Lore, and ""Codex"" aka books to learn about the universe
-Lots of costume/cosmetics to make your character unique 
CON
-2D platformer can get repetitive, and while side quests from NPC's are auto generated, they tend to be repetitive
-the bounty hunter Update Is Cool But also kind of breaks the game balance (and is repetitive/time consuming)",1700782564,1700782564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It still sucks, hard- even with a shit ton of mods
One Mod added Dark Souls stuff, that's cool, just go play Dark Souls, you'll enjoy that better.
BYOS is a cool mod, Build Your Own Ship. Space Engineers comes to mind. BYOS is a good mod, Space Engineers is just another full game focused on making your own ship in 3D. Pixel Starships and FTL are also some nice 2D games where you can vaguely augment the ships you own.

This game stinks, bad, and it's twice as painful if you were involved in watching it develop, watching in horror as Chucklefish slowly abandoned the game, released a few pitiful updates and a content update that nobody cared about, then abandoned it completely to go be a full-time publisher for some unknown reason.

The game's glitchy, unbalanced, and most of it is a slog, especially the pitiful (gutted) story.
Even the infamous issues are still unfixed due to the devs outright abandoning it, like the final boss gate dropping even the gamer-est of gamer PCs to 5 FPS when mousing over it because the highlight effect the game does applies to the gate and all its particles like some cronenberg nightmare of coding.
I hate that they gutted the plot out, I hate that the game unceremoniously destroys Earth (plus 99.999% of humanity, who were all sitting on Earth without spaceships because ???) for basically no reason other than ""uh-oh, Earth gone"" for all of like 3 minutes of the game, I hate that the entire story involves a tedious slog scanning hundreds of random knickknacks across the galaxy in the hopes RNGesus blesses you with the right kind of lantern that'll somehow unlock the knowledge of where a tribe of carnivorous plants are hunting a giant bug monster.
Weapon variety sucks for the first half of the game.
Mechs are barely implemented.
Novakids are slapped in at the last second so Chucklefish doesn't get sued by the KS backers who paid for their inclusion.
There's an entire civilization mechanic where you can run a whole town full of people with different careers and such, but it's just to earn some pocket change.
There's an entire Terraria-tier building mechanic so you can build out a huge base, but... well, your ship holds all you need, so there's no reason to build ON a planet unless you need tons of plants because ??? IDK.
Literally the only thing in the game with any effort put into it is the first few story dungeons. The last two story dungeons are, no joke, ""go left and fight a ton of cookiecutter enemies for a few minutes, then fight a boss"" and ""dig down for a few minutes and fight the final boss.""

The game would be a great baseline for a remake or a reboot, add in another race, fix the plot, blow up Space-U.N. instead of Earth for the 269034742309087th time, finish all the story dungeons, write the engine not to have all this lag, I don't know.

Anyway, yes, the game has a huge modding community, and yes, you can ""fix"" the game and most of its issues, or just replace everything to make it a whole new game, but it's kind of that whole ""Skyrim"" thing where the base game isn't worth your money so I suggest waiting for a deep sale and buying it just to mod it, since the devs should NOT be rewarded for being lazy and relying on modders to fix their issues. There should've been at least one final bugfix to tie everything off nicely, but it never came.",1700297560,1700297560,False,3,0,0.525691688060760498,0,True,False,False

It's great fun. Generally understood as similar to Terraria, but different with its own space flavour. It always gets compared to Terraria which is probably unfortunate because it really is its own game.

Recent updates have made combat, missions, and weapons way more fun. Guns, staves/magic, thrown items, bombs .... it's all here. It's amazing. I absolutely love building comfortable abodes, grand floating palaces, and emergency bunkers. Make your room full of emergency storage options, and dig a secret hole down to your command lair where all your computer systems are stored. It lets you be creative.

However, over the years it became more strict in how you play the game and added story missions you have to do. It became less of a sandbox game (like Terraria) and more of a story driven game.

You shouldn't have to mod a game from the get-go for it to be enjoyable

Ok let me preface this by saying ALL my hours on this game were after the 1.0 update. I only learned of this game history after I was 300h in.

If you are interested in learning it, I'd recommend watching the video by a youtuber called ""The Good Trash"", but if you want a quick recap, here it is:
The game was radically diferent before release. It was far more sandbox-driven, the story didn't really have a grasp on gameplay, and there was a TON more content. We're talking several cut bosses, biomes and entire features like the randomly generated monsters were a lot more developped. Unfortunately, the game had no developpement throughline. If a dev thought of a feature, it was gonna be added regardless of how well it would fits. 
Speaking of the devs, they were abused. Most basically came out of university and were hired as intern. This meant that they were paid little to none for their effort. Any that said anything were berated by the higher-ups, or straight up quit. This meant that most of the game's code was a buggy, unoptimized mess of spaghetti coding.
The 1.0 update tried to remedy this by essentially butchering the game into what it is now, which angered the community even more than it was already by the way the devs were treated.

Now, for my actual review.
The game's arstyle is gorgeous, the music (even if it gets repetive quickly) is top notch. 
Gameplay wise,  mining and general exploration feels great. 
Building is perhaps the best, there's so many diferent furnitures, blocks and decorations you can choose from for your base.
Fighting however... hoo boy. It is HORRIBLE. You can choose between ranged, melee and (later on) magic weaponry. You can craft some in each class, but if you want a worthwile weapon, you'll have to use one that is RANDOMLY GENERATED. Sure, there's unique weapons that alwasys have fixed stat (based on the planet you're on), but they are very rare and most aren't even worth it.
You're honestly better off using nothing but fast firing guns with some knockback, like a shotgun or something. Most dangerous enemies you'll be fighting are either flying, fast-moving, or just ranged guy that constantly run away.
Boss fights aren't much better either. The game WILL force you to fight these guys if you want to progress the story, and aside from like, the bird one, most devolve into a mess, be it by constantly spawning minions, having bad hitboxes (the 2nd to last final boss specifically), or because they have attacks that they do off-screen even if fully zoomed out.

Now, progression and story wise. This game's progression works in tiers. Every planet has a tier, going from 1 to 8. Higher tiered planets appear around specific stars, meaning you'll have use your spaceship to get over there. However, the big bad of the game broke your ship (and destroyed Earth but that's irelevant), so you'll have to at least take part in the story until the first boss to get the chance to progress.
After that? The story basically doesn't matter. Seriously you can just play the game without caring for it. Which is honestly a blessing in disguise, since it always the same formula of ""Please go scan specific objects from these guys"" to ""Go defeat these guys' boss please"". Repeat for every race except the umans and the Space cowboys.
It is so disappointing. Each race has a trope-infused but well crafted lore to it, so having all their quest being just fetch quest feels lazy.

And finally, we're gonna talk about performance. It is inconsistent at best, and its the game's messy code fault. Seriously this game is not optimized well. It can crash itself at complete random. Its rare but still. There's also a general problem with characters going to fast. If you fall from a great height, there's a chance the game will have trouble loading the terrain arround you. There's also time were the game just won't load a chunk at all. Or others were it lags as if you were having latency issues. In a single player game. Offline.
Oh and one final thing. The lower your FPS are, THE WORSE THOSE ISUES GET. No joke, if you limit your FPS to be under 60, these issues will pop up a ton more. It's not tied to your computer's performance, its the game itself tying a lot of the code to how high your FPS are.

I just can't recommend this game. I love this game but it is the definition of ""wasted potential"". If you're still interested in buying it, I can only recommend you mod it to hell and back
You'll see a lot of people using a mod called Frackin' universe. It's essetnially its own game, and is about as omnipresent as the Calamity mod is in the Terraria community. 
I personally don't recommend it, since it changes so much about the game that there's mods to mod a mod. Personnal recommendations are the Shellguard expansion, the Starforge, Anom's Outpost overhaul and Project Redemption.",1699462481,1699511971,False,84,3,0.790664017200469971,0,True,False,False
211820,149781391,76561199168283942,0,5,6677,0,6677,1643788483,"The no-mans sky of terraria pre-deshittfication, that with even worse performance, even on the highest end computers because from what I've heard the game is limited to running on 1 core despite having its lighting engine running separate or some shit (I'm not good with computers, just relaying some stuff I've heard about this games performance). Used to like this game and have high hopes, but well alot of the beta of this game was thrown out and the remaining bones are what this game is built off of.

Game company tried to bumrush people, tryna pull the unpaid intern shit so, generally scummy behaviour

Also fair warning, this game apparently has a memory leak on your ship, essentially the longer you stay on your ship, the laggier it gets and at a certain point theres some safety feature where it just resets your entire ship to fucken nothing. So RIP custom ship mods

Anyways, into the actual game itself well first off, the only good thing about this game is building, so if you're into that, you can get this
Thats about all the praise it gets

- One of the main selling points is random generation for ""infinite"" playtime. Well thats half right, its infinite slop, where theres generic random monster parts thrown together abomination that does nothing but jump and bump into you 1 through 10000. The randomly generated loot varies from the worst shit you can possibly find, to the most broken ass garbage you can possibly find. There is no connection to anything, anywhere you're basically a ghost floating through shallow soup, nothing matters, nothing happens. They also removed alot of the interesting dungeons the beta has, from underground bases, to sky towers and that weird crystal low gravity dungeon. They also removed crystal planets entirely along with tentacle dirt planets

- Another selling point is the ""different races"", well they're COSMETIC, they follow the EXACT SAME PROGRESSION PATH, EXACT SAME WEAPONS AND GEAR, NO DIFFERENCE EXCEPT ARMOR SKINS. They REMOVED the racial weapons and gear, so instead of maybe glitch/avian type weapons with unique attributes and appearance, you craft generic steel sword, generic titanium gun, etc.

- Story wise, its shallow kids stuff thats very boring. The story doesn't progress until you do the shitty scan missions, there are no stakes, this giant ass tentacle planet goes nowhere and has no 0 presence in the universe. You're forced into being the good guy and defeat said giant ass tentacle planet thing. Theres also the bounty hunting stuff which forces you to do the most tedious ass missions, with you essentially falling for fake glasses and nose trick (thats legitimately part of the bounty missions) and then they force you to continue running around like a headless chicken. The background lore on the species is paper thin, its the betas story but stripped down for toddlers to understand. Npcs have 1 box of dialogue and thats it, the quests are some goofy goober fetch quests that don't really reward or do anything. Crew members are stupid as hell and just as shallow. There are ""lore"" books, but they don't contribute jack shit

- The progression is terrible and horrendously boring. Go to planet, mine a few minerals and then farm some fucken planets for the cloth and then make the gear and backpack or ""Environmental Protection Pack"". You basically need these to go to the next higher tier of planet, which means no use in unique back items. The EPPs are basically progression gate locks, nothing more, they add nothing except a requirement to go to the next tier of planet, because if you land on them without the high enough tier EPP, you just get this environmental condition that saps percentage health or does some other buttfucking damage to you. So the ""variety"" of planets is really just a biome progression lock, like a downgrade from exploration in Terraria. Speaking of biomes, there are ""mini biomes"" that don't give anything. They straight up don't give anything except cosmetics at best, they do nothing, they have nothing, they just look nice.

- The difficulty of this game is hilariously bad, theres only two ways to really die
A. You fall to your death from some random cliff or rock breakage on a planet with high gravity because you were falling asleep to all classical, wimp ass music
B. You fall into lava because the music was putting you to sleep
Thats it lol, you can either mass bandage and instantly heal your hp in any other scenario, like as if terraria removed health potion cooldowns

Or, theres this funny thing about shields where they can stun npcs by slightly bumping into them. Do it just right and you can do it to monsters to, where you bump them which stuns them briefly and then you can keep walking into them until you shove em up against a all and they all die from being stunlocked by bad game design.

- If it wasn't clear from me earlier, the music in this game is ill fitting to put it lightly. Its the most mushy peas classical music that puts you to sleep. Genuinely, I was snoozing a couple hours in of nonstop hope and love type sounding music. They REMOVED COMBAT MUSIC from the beta, aka instead of music changing to combat music, it just remains sappy ass classical music. You could be burning a village down and it would still play that awfully fitting music. I thought this was A SPACE EXPLORATION GAME, whats with this sleep inducing music

- While everyone says modding can ""fix"" things, its less of patching up the gaping holes, more of attaching arms and other limbs onto said holes. Frackin universe, the big fix, does add alot more to do on each planet type, more monsters and so on, but introduces its own huge glop of issues. Well the EPPs I mentioned earlier are less generalized, the final tier is the ""cold protection one"" except it has all the previous ones installed. Frack universe removes the other previous environmental immunities so instead of just equipping one, you have to switch between 15 of them. Frackin universe also has alot of artificial progression gates, because the mod creator was upset about some people mcspeedrunning through the game and complaining about lack of content. Theres now this ""research tree"", which is essentially a progression lock that incentives you to do insufferable amounts of wandering through the empty randomly generated planets and digging dirt.

Frackin universe also adds infinite amounts of inventory and space clutter, dungeons that are mostly bland to okay, with maybe 2 good missions with actual custom bosses. The planets range from some good ones, like the cybsphere to okay, to kind of annoying, and pretty much a checklist if you have enough of the environmental resistance to its atmosphere.

I'll probably add more of the problems this game and its mods have to this review at another time, I've only covered a good chunk of them, but the point is This game is only good for its building, get terraria or any other game instead if you're looking for progression, a challenge, anything really",1699481955,1699482140,False,1,0,0.499124348163604736,0,True,False,False

Graphics - It's a 2D pixel game, so it's not gonna need a 4090 to run.
Sound - Got a pretty good soundtrack, good to listen in game or if you buy the soundtrack for a dollar (only DLC of the game btw) you've got some bops to listen too.
Story - Only real bad part. For a sandbox game trying to be a space Terraria, the story drags on. It's a good way to get the basic survival things down, but the forced story will drive you bonkers.
Modding Ability - Stellar. The game is clearly a sandbox when it comes to mods. From QOL mods that don't change much, to whole content and overhaul mods like Frackin Universe, you'll find something cool here.
Multiplayer - Meh. There's no server browser, and featured servers are not a thing in SB. However, the community is great at making some great servers, both vanilla and modded.

- no aliens (starborn are just humans with superpowers)
- like 1700 worlds
- 99% barren rocks and moons, roughly 15-30% of them are inaccessible due to being gas giants or stars.  The remaining planets are all story-specific locations or generic forests with one or two earth-like ones that are also content-barren and not worth exploring 
- boring main story
- space travel is literally a bunch of loading screens taped together 
- building sucks
- procedurally generated quests
- the same 4-5 dungeons over and over
- scanning shit for no reason 
- like 15 guns
- single piece armor system with a second layer you literally never even see
- built with paid labor of like 300 people over 8 years from one of the most respected industry giants in gaming, and multiple hundreds of millions of dollars from multiple studios and corporations including fucking Microsoft 
- No building in your ship, only superficial changes to the exterior that make it harder or easier to get to your cockpit, which is the only part of your ships interior that actually matters.
- nothing to spend your money on
- boring, ugly, generic NPCs with 3 impersonal lines of dialogue each
- like 3 major cites and 10-ish handcrafted locations that anyone will ever see
- quests that suck and don't matter and lie to you by giving you the illusion of choice
- 4 major factions that are all the same both morally and incredibly similar content-wise, each of which are forced upon you and breathe down your neck any time you're around other humans, including a pirate faction that hates you if you kill and steal from literally anyone other than specifically designated targets for procedurally generated missions
- progression is gated by the perks system so 90% of players will never see the entirety of the base building system or the gun crafting system or get a class C ship etc etc.
- literally zero interesting systems outside of the main shooting and looting borderlands type gameplay with components that all constantly fight each other and don't work together at all (carry weight too low, stealth is useless, Skyrim shout powers are all stupid and outclassed by everything else because they don't scale with level, enemy AI is braindead, economy is completely unbalanced and makes no sense despite the push for ""realism"" everywhere else in the game, etc.)
- runs like shit; players told to ""upgrade their computers""
- crashes to desktop and save-ruining glitches not uncommon 
- cringe pseudo-ironic smug reddit-tier soypilled manchild Rick and Morty dialogue that makes me want to turn the game off and not play as the character I am presented, because none of the dialogue options would ever be said by a sane human being with more than 4 brain cells.  more than happy to blow smoke up your ass with pointless, bloviating dialogue that doesn't even give you information about the characters or world and just exists to waste your time and the writer's time and the implementation team's time and the voice actors' time
- Skyrim shouts but in space
- 70 dollars

Starbound:
- cool aliens (and furries)
- literally infinite worlds
- all of them are interesting 
- generic main story but you aren't really pushed to do it so it doesn't matter
- interesting space travel system that actually matters and is build into the game's progression
- building is interesting, granular, and detailed, and is a great outlet for player creativity 
- procedurally generated quests
- at least 120 dungeons and cool mini landmarks, with more using mods
- scanning shit so you can remake it in your 3d printer to build or decorate with
- infinite procedurally generated guns that are actually different from each other
- 4-piece armor system with additional dedicated layers for appearance so you don't have to always look like you're minmaxing (even if you are)
- built with the slave labor of 15-17 year old girls over like 3 years with Kickstarter money by a dude who did some texture work in Terraria 
- you can build literally your entire ship inside and out however you like, with zero restriction other than the world size limit
- immense catalogues of stuff to spend money on and an economy balanced around reasonable drop rates for money 
- cute and cool generic NPCs that add to the world's atmosphere and lore
- 1 central hub for story content, more with mods, and 10-20 unique and handcrafted story dungeons that are all easily re-visitable through a menu
- quests that do not bother with player choice because they know you're going to do it for the loot anyway
- like 8 different factions that all hate each other and have interesting motives for doing so that actually seem somewhat believable and aren't all exclusively morally good universe savers who want to make sure everyone is happy at all times
- progression is only gated by your ability to go to new planets with fuel, collect resources, and use those resources to go to new planets to get better resources, which rewards exploration and encourages players to interact with the core gameplay loop and wealth of content
- landlord and tenant system that loops into the core sandbox gameplay of building and taking over planets that doesn't badger you constantly so you can take it at your own pace and collect rewards as you please, fossil system, bug catching and trophies that give you cool display items for your houses and a collection to work towards, pet capture system that gives you companions that can help you in combat and are actually scaled and make sense, mech system that helps you in collecting resources from asteroids and in deep space, crew system that gives you a reason to build your ship out further than just looks or storage, etc etc .
- runs on a toaster
- simply does not crash or break unless you mod it and the mod fucks something up
- simple dialogue with no explicit player voice so you don't have to subscribe to a specific character to play the game.  Also does not act like it is important to the events of the game when it literally makes no difference
- you can capture a snake and a lizard and put them in your ship as pets :)

Putting aside the employee treatment and taking the game at face value, it’s a fairly good space exploration game. I’d go so far as to say that it’s better than Starfield is at present and better than No Man’s Sky was at launch. That being said, the game still feels… hollow. I can’t quite describe why, but something about the construction of the worlds, the samey quests in the story mode, and the gutting of the universe lore compared to earlier builds of the game creates an experience with just enough sense of purpose to keep you playing, but not enough sense of purpose to motivate you beyond that.

You wander around with vague notions of what you’re supposed to do, passing from world to world as they all start to blend together. If there were better world-building, or a more compelling story, or even just a more complex planet-generating system, then this game would be far more enjoyable.

That being said, gameplay mods, especially Frackin’ Universe, can greatly improve the experience if you’re willing to give them the opportunity. But, in a similar fashion as Bethesda games, it’s up to you for whether you want to buy a middling game that’s saved by mods, or if you want to simply walk away and find a game that’s better at face value.

I’ll admit that I’ve gotten far more than $15 worth of enjoyment out of this game, but I also gave it much more slack than it might have deserved.

Speaking of flaws it has the most boring main quest i've ever seen in my life, life long grind and the same lifeless planets.

You can build your own city, gather your crew and kill the final boss with the power of friendship. If you're more of a solo player, but you don't like mining all the components of your equipment - you can buy yourself a weapon and some armor in the same city. The only downside is that you have no need to match your equip with the main quest. Starting with the first artifact, you can have full endgame gear against flowers with a leather armor xd.

I stopped playing when I was just flying from planet to planet trying to find one particular item, only to find the same NPC city over and over again. I got really bored at some point, even though I hadn't officially beat it yet. The game feels like an anticlimax. It starts off so strong, but in the end it just dims down and it left me wondering what the hell I was still doing.

I however still recommend this game, because even though this is a downside, for the price you pay you get lots of hours worth of fun and great content.

2023 update:
this company sucks ass, treats their community horribly, lies about development.

the game is just as awful as when I originally wrote my review, nothing to do, boring single biome planets, basically no actual gameplay.

the game is only good if you get a bunch of mods, and the major mod that a lot of people use (fraken universe) is made by a guy who steals other people's mods, integrates them into his, and then marks theirs and other mods he simply doesn't like as incompatible, explicitly implementing code to block those mods from functioning.

the game is pretty much only good as a nsfw game with the community nsfw mod, let's be honest. as an actual game, it's literally nothing.

the company also tries to integrate said mods into the game without compensating the mod devs, going as far as to ask for modders to simply hand over their ips for free. while integrating mods into games is fine, I don't respect any company who is willing to offer such minimal compensation when integrating a mod into a commercial product. if starbound were free, I wouldn't be as upset about it.",1653700268,1698084637,False,34,0,0.654450953006744385,0,True,False,False

It felt like something may have been here. After all it is in space where there are near limitless possibilities......just not in this universe. This game is like a 2-D version of the original No Mans Sky. I need to say this game feels like it was a bunch of ideas that started together but only a handful might have actually been finished. This game really sucks. The same procedurally generated creatures and crap over and over with lets be honest very little real variation in other than a few swapped body parts and you will have seen all of them after about 8-12 planets. Most of the loot you find is almost always useless wherever you go weather it be some chest near a planets core or one you find just lying on the ground. It is all random besides boss weapons wich drop from there specific boss. No benefits to picking a race other than some dialogue so don't think too hard when making your character and don't get to too picky with clothing as you will be covering them in armor anyway. Having to go find scannable objects all over the game without direction is beyond the normal level of boring when the game is the same from start to finish with 0 variation at all besides finding a sea of cosmetics all over the place in random junk and most look like crap. You get a mech at some point with a drill and a gun. I know what your thinking: I can fight baddies and drill through dirt fast right? Well your half right. You will kill all things fast at the expense of being slow and once you upgrade your matter manipulator twice the drill becomes obsolete and you realize that the drill only digs dirt really well. Everything else it take 2 or more times as long for some odd reason. The mech is mostly used for sending into space to kill ships and board enemy vessels for more mediocre loot. Why the hell do I have a mech in space for combat and exploration and not a ship? It doesn't make any sense at all. Most bosses are a cakewalk but are a slog to get to because you can't simply go fight them instead you have more and more scanning to do. There is even a planet that is nothing but a sea of lava and the game does not tell you that there is no real way of exploring it without just dying yet there things to be found at the bottom. So much of this games instruction is untold so you end up finding out a bunch of things you should have been told to begin with about 40 hours in. The game has ""lore"" but most of it is so uninteresting I stopped reading them. There are a few good things here and there but to be perfectly honest there is simply so much nonsense in the game it doesn't deserved to be mentioned. What an absolute drag to play with 0 return.

It used to be a great game. Until 1.0, when Chucklefish decided to kill its creation. 
Then, abandonment came. It has not received any significant updates in YEARS. 
Its quality, surprisingly, has worsened over the years. And their creators are worsening, too.

You know what kept me playing for thousands of hours here? The modding community. That's the good one. It makes the game a lovely, wonderful, incredible place to be. 
And yet, with all the mods... It is getting worse month after month. Patches are needed, a lot of improvements that SHOULD NOT be granted to be made by the modding community.
I really want this game to improve, to be the star it used to be for my friends and I.

If anyone could get this OUT of the hands of Chucklefish I'd willingly help it to happen just to give this marvel its deserved glory. 

Until then, don't give a cent to them. If you've already made your mind or if you've already bought this game... go to the workshop page. It's the best decision you can make from this point.",1482530835,1697255248,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My review says I posted it at 1k because I liked it a lot at the time; I came back and edited it a year ago when I had a shitload of hours. I spent most of that time screwing around on multiplayer servers, not playing the actual game!!! It's still mid! Don't give Chuckfish your money

As someone who spent thousands of hours playing this game in its golden age, I can safely say: this game is mid. What used to be a grand, exciting project to create Terraria in fucking SPACE, became a mid, mediocre, and forgettable game where you're stuck on the rails of a boring ass story that gets in the way of you getting to do all the cool shit like flying planet to planet. Exciting old lore, bosses, all of that is removed in favor of new and forgettable story. And it takes so goddamn long to fix your ship and start flying around in space, while you're stuck on a generic and boring and featureless starter planet doing who the hell cares.

I sound really passionate and that's because I am. I experienced the early betas of this game and saw potential. But this game turned out just like Cube World did, only out of incompetence and not neglect",1438040558,1697240308,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So upfront the base game has some issues some things feel just like they could be a little bit better that I will mention in the review and there are some bugs, but, big but, this game has a pretty active modding community. I recommend even if you want a vanilla experience go on the steam workshop get whatever the currently updated performance optimizing mod there is, any up to date bug fixes there are and if it's still up to date when you read this, and Alpha Combat (it re-balances the weapons a bit so there are more ""good"" options for weapons). Just be careful with the Date on the mods I know older ones cause issues with the bounty hunter update. I have comments on in this one so if anyone has any specific mods along this vanilla+ theme feel free to point them out there. No, I see you typing Frackin Universe; you know as well as I do that that is no where near vanilla+.

Normal Review Part
You are going to hear the nickname ""Space Terraria"" when people talk about this game, and while it does have it's similarities, it is it's own game. For one late game is a lot less crazy the mobility doesn't get up to that level but has a more grounded feeling. I don't want to spoil too much but even later bosses don't have you flying around like crazy and have a more ""Dark Soulsy"" approach with enemies usually having only occasional telegraphed attacks (aside from the cyber bullet hell. You will know him when you meet him). Now I mentioned Dark Souls but this is by no means anywhere in the same vibe or difficulty. Combat is very forgiving as long as you are appropriately geared and there is a much more lighthearted sci-fy adventure energy to it. Plenty of little jokes here and there. The story isn't any literary/cinematic masterpiece but it's simple and fun and there is plenty of lore books that help with a bit of the world building. Also if you are a colectaholic this game has many collectibles between the bugs, monsters (there are basically pokeballs), food, fish, trophies, and aforementioned lore books.

Overall I'd give the vanilla game 6.5/10
Modded however makes this game a 9/10 for me though with mods it can be all over the place and up to personal preference and what mods you have. There is a reason as of writing this is the game I have the most hours in.",1689216071,1697212413,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

[h2]Reason #1: It’s like Terraria, but IN SPACE![/h2]
It is generally accepted that Terraria is a great game. Starbound is similar to Terraria, but has less focus on combat and more focus on exploration. And of course, it’s in space! And as we know, everything is better… IN SPAAAAAAAAAAACE! So if you like Terraria, or even Minecraft, you should definitely give Starbound a try!
[h2]Reason #2: No microtransactions[/h2]
Lootboxes, in-game stores or even a neverending stream of minor DLCs… you can find at least one of these in most games nowadays, even in some single player titles. Starbound has none of these. The only paid DLC for the game is its soundtrack, which is not even in-game content.
[h2]Reason #3: It’s affordable[/h2]
In addition to not having microtransactions of any sort, this game is cheap. Its original price is around 14 EUR and the soundtrack which includes dozens of tracks costs 80 cents. Both of these regularly go on sale, cutting the price in half!
[h2]Reason #4: The soundtrack is epic[/h2]
The game’s soundtrack was created by Curtis Schweitzer, who also contributed music to Halo Infinite. It fits the game perfectly and has a chill, nostalgic yet epic vibe. Great stuff!
[h2]Reason #5: Endless amounts of content[/h2]
Starbound was designed from the ground up to be moddable. New biomes, new species, new clothes, new quests…. Instead of buying these as DLCs or something, players can create and share all of these and more. If something is not in the game, you can most likely add it to the game. There are new mods published on the Steam Workshop to this very day, so running out of content is almost impossible. And what’s best is the Steam version makes mods very simple to install. Entire mod packs can be installed with a single click and the Steam Workshop does the rest for you. Incredible!
[h2]Reason #6: Avali[/h2]
Thanks to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=729558042]one of the game’s most popular mods[/url] you can play as the Avali! Enough said! :D
[h2]Reason #7: Ultimate player freedom[/h2]
If you tought Starbound stopped at the usual type of mods, you thought wrong. Starbound utilizes so called client-side mods, which let you further customize your experience in multiplayer without affecting the experience of others. You want some of the characters to look different just on your screen? Or maybe you want to fly around and have infinite blocks as if you were playing creative mode in Minecraft. What about an infinite inventory? Maybe some tuning of the difficulty settings? You can do all of these with client-side mods without the people you play with also having to use these very same things. Revolutionary!
[h2]Reason #8: The blinking meme[/h2]
You might have seen or even used [url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/blinking-white-guy]this meme[/url] before! Did you know that its origins lie in Starbound? Now you do!
[h2]Reason #9: Instruments and bands[/h2]
A unique feature of Starbound is that it lets you play music in-game on a number of instruments. There are a few default songs and also many song packs you can download. Or you can create your own.  You can even play some specially created songs as a multiplayer band.
[h2]Reason #10: The whole gang can play[/h2]
The game features multiplayer without putting any limitation on player count. The only real limit is how much the hardware can handle. This means that with enough players and good server hardware the game can essentially become a mini-MMO.
[h2]Bonus Reason: Multiverstar[/h2]
Multiverstar, my chill, non-toxic, professionally run Starbound community just relaunched this year and it’s better than ever! It’s a cool place for Starbound newbies and veterans alike where you can share your creations and play with others on a modded server with loads of content.

GAMEPLAY

Starbound is a 2D game about a goon (of the Player’s choice) running around, destroying the environments of countless planets, killing the inhabitants of said planets, collecting stuff and (maybe) building stuff.

It features incredibly lackluster RPG elements, limited to the equipment the Player Character (PC) wears (which also determines how strong the PC is) and the race of the PC. The race of the PC affects the layout of the Player’s ship, which means that it is a stylistic choice only.

In theory, this sounds good – in practice, it winds up not being very good.

Running around is affected negatively by the fact that this game, even while being played by a single person, features latency and lag caused by bad connection – meaning that the PC will sometimes be moved back to a previous position, objects that were interacted with will revert to a state of not being interacted with and enemies who get hit will not take damage, as though they were not hit.

As a consequence, combat (which is incredibly simple, relying on an energy meter [stamina bar] for most actions and boiling down to occasionally being able to jump or dash away from an enemy’s attack) is also affected negatively. Not only that, but the Player’s progression and the difficutly curve move in such a manner that the Player is always very close to getting killed by most encounters and never does said Player feel strong (due to limiting design).

Fortunately, the good part of Starbound are the environments (which are not THAT negaitvely affected by the constant latency issues), the things that can be found by the Player in said environments and the abiltiy to destroy everything in favor of building things. Since Starbound is built of blocks, the way building and destorying things happens is that a batch of blocks gets destroyed (or placed) at once, which makes the process a lot more manageable and even enjoyable.

However, that does not make amends for the rest of this game’s unfortunate performance. There are some interesting bosses that show up every now and then, but there are chance based drops from them – CHANCE BASED DROPS in the single-player game. It’s just a jumble of horrible design choices.

PRESENTATION

Starbound is beautiful. Pixel-art that allows for wonderful sights to unveil themselves before the Player, both as backgrounds and foregrounds, incredibly soothing music and satisfying sound effects that provide great feedback. It’s fantastic.
3/3

STORY

Starbound tells a tale of galactical annihilation and eldritch monstrosities, a cult dedicated to said monstrosities and a group of fellows tasked with protecting the Galaxy from harm. The PC is one such Protector, and goes on a trip to collect a number of macguffins, with which a door is to be open, which door leads to the elditch monster, which gets killed and everything is wonderful again.

The game features a plethora of interesting things – related to the many races that are present – and has a LOT of lore connected to them, but at the same time it constantly falls into plotholes it has created. Robots, who are culturally and technoloically programmed to be stuck in medieval times, somehow design and manifacture spacefaring vessels. Plant people with the intelligence of 6-year old children also get to make their own space-ships. Religious luddites who throw people off of buildings as a religious ritual – also get to have their own space-ships.

The lore is interesting on a surface level, but the deeper the Plaeyr goes, the more riiculous it becomes.
1/3

Legendary Point

Does this game get the legendary point, so craved and wanted by all and none at the same time? No. NO! How does anyone expect from me to give an always on DRM pile of steaming trash the legendary point? I’m not giving it to Starbound, no, thank you. 0/1

CONCLUSION

5/10. An average game that gets a bit too much love from other folks. Play it on the lowest difficulty and build. Not worth it for much else, really. Could recommend it to fans of Minecraft or Terraria, but then why wouldn’t they play either Minecraft or Terraria instead?

 On the wall of shame, I hang this game. So much potential, lost. Alas, I can’t save it.

Rating: ★★★★★

Get ready for an interstellar epic of astronomical proportions - it's ""Starbound,"" the game that boldly goes where no meme has gone before, and it's got all the stars (five of them, to be exact) to prove it. Here's why this game is so outrageously, side-splittingly, and meme-tastically amazing:

Endless Exploration, Much Wow: In ""Starbound,"" you'll journey to a galaxy far, far away (just kidding, it's in your PC) and explore procedurally generated planets that are as diverse as a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get - whether it's a lush paradise, a fiery hellscape, or a frozen tundra that'll give you ""Winter is Coming"" vibes.

Epic Pixel Art: So Aesthetic, Much Wow: The game's pixel art is so lit that even the most hardcore memelords will be like, ""this is fine."" You'll be snapping Instagram-worthy shots of your breathtaking bases and planets with memes as captions.

Le Epic Creativity: Build your own bases, spacecraft, and meme factories. With an arsenal of building materials and decorations, you can create structures that are danker than a doge meme.

Such Quests, Many Stories: ""Starbound"" throws you into the memeiverse with a rich backstory and quests that are more intriguing than ""The Two Buttons"" meme. NPCs bring their unique tales to the table, making the game feel as alive as ""This is Fine"" dog.

Crafting Extravaganza: Get ready for some seriously in-depth crafting, 'cause the options here are more diverse than the ""Expand Dong"" meme. Experiment with recipes, gather resources, and upgrade your gear like a pro.

Multiplayer LOLs: Form meme-worthy crews with your friends and embark on hilarious adventures across the galaxy. Teamwork has never been this amusing since ""Distracted Boyfriend""!

Mods Galore, Prepare for Takeoff: ""Starbound's"" modding community is more vibrant than a Nyan Cat rainbow. Enhance your experience with mods and you'll be like ""Wombo Combo!"" every time you launch the game.

Playstyles for Days, Y'all: Whether you're into combat, farming, or meme-hunting, ""Starbound"" has got you covered. Be the hero, the farmer, the merchant, or all of the above like a boss.

Updates? Such News, Much Wow: The developers keep dropping updates like ""Distracted Boyfriend"" memes on the internet. They're committed to making ""Starbound"" the ultimate meme-tastic experience.

Soothing Yet Epic, Like Peanut Butter Jelly Time: The game's soundtrack is so chill that you'll be nodding like ""Yeah Boi"" while battling alien foes. Play for a quick meme break or lose yourself for hours - you decide!

In a world full of memes, ""Starbound"" stands out as an epic LOLventure that's as dank as a freshly baked meme. Don't miss out on this one, because the game's just that ""Infinite Monkey Theorem"" meme waiting to go viral in your heart. Strap in, my fellow memelords, and launch into the cosmos of ""Starbound"" - your epic adventure begins now! 🚀🌌😂",1413161655,1696203443,True,0,0,0.47999998927116394,6,True,False,False

Starbound is one of those games you really want to succeed, since it just has sooo much potential to be absolutely awesome, but at the end of the day the game just lowkey sucks. The idea of Starbound is that you can travel through an infinitely generated sandbox of a galaxy, upgrading your spaceship and finding cool stuff. But the game just fails at almost everything, such as:

-	There are many unique and cool races, but it basically makes no difference which one you pick.
-	The progression system is a complete and utter joke that doesn’t exist.
-	Story-progression is about as interesting as watching paint dry.
-	After 10 or so planets you get to the point where you have pretty much seen everything there is to see. (The same generated structures show up over, and over, and over, and over…)
-	The NPCs are braindead, only speaking 1 line per character. 1 LINE.
-	Since you can just decorate your ship, there is no actual reason to build anything on planets.

This is all such a shame, since Starbound is such a unique idea which I really want to succeed. There is so much potential in its ideas it’s almost even more frustrating to play this mess of a game. The races are all super cool and unique, and the music is incredibly good. So good that you wonder how the hell it ended up in this game to begin with. Just amazing *chefs kiss*. 

You can make the game somewhat playable with mods, but no amount of cake icing can fix this fundamentally broken cake in my opinion, and if you really need mods to make your game playable, is it even good in the first place?

I don’t believe all of this is the developer’s fault. I’ve heard that Chucklefish overall are some pretty shady guys. I’ve heard stories that they underpaid or straight up didn’t pay some of the Starbound developers for example. (Good thing Stardew Valley escaped their grasp am I right?)

[u] Overall, this game just sucks. Its world and ideas are so rich, but its execution is just so bad it makes me sad. (Music is good though) 2/10 play Terraria instead. [/u]

On one hand, I love this game, and I am grateful I was along for the ride during it's updates. Sadly, Starbound isn't worth paying even 15 dollars for when Terraria exists. This game has such a linear progression that replayability isnt really there outside of modded race attributes and the like, and exploration feels worthless after one playthrough.

The only reason i am rating this positively is because with mods, i find this game more enjoyable than vanilla Terraria (of course, tmodloader exists, making this review pointless). I recommend Frackin' Universe as a start. The combat in this game, especially when modded is incredibly refined and polished compared to Terraria, the weapons and animations feel super nice compared to png sword swing.

This game has its ups and downs (especially the developer drama), however i still find it to be quite enjoyable.

UI - has barely any explanations- heck even the fact that you can move it away from the center of the screen is not mentioned or hinted at on the ui itself. 
Planetary travel is not explained anywhere. It would literally take the tiniest little ship assistant AI text blurb to explain this when you first open the menu and the devs chose not to. 

You have to get very lucky with random weapon finds on the first planet to even survive. Since you can't really craft anything remarkably good yourself. 

The combat is also nothing pleasant. Most weapons have combo animations that then go on cooldown, so if you don't have a place to back off to, you are going to take a lot of damage and not be able to do much about it BECAUSE - once the enemy is in YOUR hitbox, they are immune. But they can still hurt you.

When Starbound first came out as a full game, it ran like crap and crashed my PC within minutes of starting a journey. Since then, Chucklefish has definitely fixed this issue, so much so that I rarely have FPS drops, if at all. 

Content wise, the game holds itself up pretty well. Lotta lore to uncover, places to explore, and things to hunt. This, like with many other open-world exploration games, is only amplified with mods.

While the price has not changed since I first purchased this for my ex and I back during the beta build, I'd argue it's well worth the price nowadays.

With how extremely bare bones it is and the now painfully linear story progression making things even worse because it's salad dressing on top of something already plain as fuck. If you are still hellbent on playing this, go get as many mods as you possibly can so it's got something for you to do. If that doesn't sound like a decent enough time or you're one of those weirdos who has a gripe against playing a game modded, then just go play Wargroove instead.

Jump into janky multiplayer with your friends and then wind up at ground zero when one of your friends drops a nuke in a city you're standing in (true story). Play it until you burn out.  Then put it down for a while.  Then come right back to it again after a few weeks or months and do it all again with a totally new character.

The content and replay value are both there. If you've enjoyed No Man's Sky, venturing through space in 2D is pretty awesome as well.

At times, progression can be slow and the amount of times you are dying can stack pretty high. Starbound is not without its flaws. Despite whatever flaws it has, it does a stellar job in generating random worlds to visit and explore. Excellent color choices and stunning landscapes.

It is beginning to show a slight amount of age to it, so I wouldn't delay a terrible amount before playing it. I'm sure it will continue to get QoL updates both officially and through the community, but why waste time? It's worth the $15 price tag.",1694035569,1694035569,True,3,0,0.552845537662506104,0,True,False,False

Previously, there were race-specific backstory journals, potentially hinting at upcoming race-specific stories. Now, no matter what race you picked, you are shoehorned into the same story which was equally shoehorned into the game. It is a requirement to even leave the starting planet to follow the story and it drains all potential creativity from a game built on creativity. 
Additionally, instead of being able to find unique, sprawling dungeons in the world, they're shifted to be story content that you teleport to and cannot interact with at all beyond killing the things in your way before reaching the end, entirely removing the building aspect of the sandbox building game for this linear content that it really was never designed for.

worth the $7. 

This game has the basic formula to be a favorite of mine. However the game also tries literally ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING to make you stop playing. but not in the Getting over It kind of way. I mean in pure Teddies, Boredom, Frustration. Or like starring at Discord light mode for four hours strate while also using 2G wifi to beat snake. With that said I did find a way to enjoy this game. and I mean enjoy. 
Step one was Casual only fuck hunger, fuck not being able to teleport underground, fuck lousing 30% of yourself when you die.
Step two, get instant crafting, better platform falling, more planet info, optimizbound(and any others you can find), melee aiming, perennial crops, and more threads. all of these mods are requierd for me to even consider pressing play. 
But when I do get all the """"""""""""kinks"""""""""""" sorted out then it actually becomes playable. I find that the game is an open world, fetch quest simulator where the story isn't important, but instead an excuse to do stuff. 
I like that. That works well. spelunking for metals in a planet is mind easing. doing boss fights is exiting. Squeezing as much efficiency out of the space one your low tear ship appease my OCD. and raiding ships with mecks are so fun when your being over whelmed on the way to the ship and you can barely doge all the enime's attacks whill's also barley being able to hit them as well making it a war of attrition where your tight maneuverability is the only thing keeping you alive is so exhilarating.

So there is fun to be had, Iff (not a typo) you can get the right mods, get pass the bigining, get your teck, have think skin to brush off small things that would get other people angry, And you don't have any DLC sized mods because they completely messed up the delicet balance of an enjoyable experience for me.

Thanks frendo I literally couldn't of figured out anything about this game on my own :)

Don't listen to the comments calling it ""abandoned"". It's not abandoned, it's *finished*. That's a hard concept for some to understand.

It has a smooth building system (with tons of furniture and blocks), space exploration (you can expand an customize your ship), a solid main story, fun missions, lots of weapon options, and mech-building. You can recruit crew, who can help you fight and provide some effects on your ship. You can create entire settlements, attract merchants, and collect rent.

Yep, glad I skipped over it in my first playthrough. The planets get samey fast, which sucks because you need to visit the different types multiple times just to progress through the story, which really encourages players to ignore it and get the best equipment in the game before doing any of the dungeons. And once you do that, the game becomes really easy until the last two missions, at which point it gets hard. But not in a good way, definitely not in a good way. One of the other things you can do in Starbound is build a colony, but I honestly haven't ever done that because all the blocks that I'd want to use are either require a lot of materials to produce in sufficient quantities, or aren't unlocked by default & need to be found before you can craft them. And furniture? Don't worry, you just have to hope you get lucky and find blueprints for it in random chests occasionally found on planet's surfaces, or that an NPC is selling them.

I do not hate Starbound. I just find it bland. Should other people play it? Yeah, I think so - I know that I liked playing it at first, even in vanilla. But if you want to have fun playing it, and for there to be any amount of replayability at all, you absolutely need to use mods.

Developers made a lot changes, but some problems were never fixed.

1) Some mechanics feel pretty gimmicky. For example mecha. Do I need it? Yes, for sure! I can explore empty asteroid fields space what take planet slot near the star. Can use it to land on a planet. But for what? If planet is hazardous your mecha will start loosing hp. Not much sense to do it. Maybe I can use it to fly to other randomly generated space ships? Yes! You will find there details to upgrade your mecha! So you can fly between asteroids for no reason at all even longer..
2) Game turns into a game where single endgame goal is to collect all cosmetic items. Sometimes mindlessly searching for specific planet in hopes of getting chest with right item.
3) You don't have collection tab. Sticker book. I wanna see at least what items ive already collected. You have tab to see captured animals, but not tab with your cosmetics what you have collected.
4) Some items are way too easy to craft and you will never lack any resources.
5) Too little ammount of dungeons. Temples, sewers etc. Most of them are worthless unless you want to have this particular bed from this structure on your base.
6) Performance issues even on decent PC
7) Most bosses are fat and boring. All what you need to do is to hit a lot and dodge 1-3 similar moves over and over again.
8) When you full upgrade your ship\tech\matter manipulator you still will get items what were required for all this upgrades. They are still looted from everywhere.

Starbound was a game I followed through its beta versions for many years, I still remember how it each update would delete my save files and I had to start over. But despite that it was still fun to start over because there were new content each time so it felt fresh. Needless to say, I really liked Starbound and I was very excited about version 1.0 finally releasing.

Starbound offered a vast universe with interesting areas to explore and cool items to find. On top of that it had a rather enjoyable story mode. But I think the story mode was the thing that hurt Starbound the most, since it killed off all the replayability the game had. After you are done with the story mode once, the game doesn't offer much to you. As you keep exploring the ""vast"" universe you start to realize that there actually isn't much to explore, you will most likely see all the interesting stuff the game can offer while playing through the story for the first time, after that it all just feels the same over and over again. The game offers different classes to play with; mainly melee, ranged and mage but honestly there isn't much variety to make you want to replay as a new class. There are also different races which you can choose from but they are only for cosmetics as well and don't offer any real gameplay difference, which is a really missed opportunity. Endgame content is equally lacking, you unlock ancient vaults where you can explore but that again just ends up being the same thing really fast. And the bounty hunting quests are dreadfully boring as well.

When I first got around playing Starbound I thought it was Terraria in space, but that I realized soon enough that I was wrong, because Terraria offered so much replay value while Starbound is a one time experience for me. Replaying through the story is tideous because you have to go through the explorations all over again but this time they don't feel exciting, you have to go through the story missions again, which are fine on your first run but again they just end up being boring the second time around, only then to be able to get to the boss. Every time you want to fight against a boss you have to play through that stage again which is not fun at all. 

Despite all of this Starbound is a beautiful game, it has soul to it. There are a great variety of cosmetics and furniture, you can get pets, some vehicles, unique weapons etc. 

So my final verdict is that, Starbound is a fun game, but only for your first playthrough and it doesn't offer too much after that so buy the game with that in mind. But I am sure you will enjoy the game itself while it lasts so I would definitely recommend it if you are not expecting hundreds of hours of entertainment from the game.",1692101651,1692101651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Apparently there was a core team, and a revolving door of unpaid ""contributors"" doing a decent portion of the work. anyone asking to be paid was yelled at by tiy, the lead developer of starbound and founder of chucklefish. this made any attempts at gradually changing and polishing the game pointless, because new devs unfamiliar with what the previous dev was attempting to implement would step in, and see the current state of the game as something to add onto, instead of improve.

The Good Trash made an amazing video about the state of starbound, so i updated this section of the review to include the revolving door section of their video. if you have 50 minutes to look at that instead of skimming a steam review, i'd recommend watching it.
https://youtu.be/2i2_BUffRmM?t=1385

here's some issues off the top of my head:
There are easy to defeat enemies that take actual minutes to fight because they turn invincible for long stretches of time. This wouldn't be a big problem, except they're very common, and since i'm playing on a mediocre computer, the game's poor optimization rears its ugly head. 
You can't die. You can near-instantly heal to full health with almost no cooldown, at the cost of grinding cutting down vines or farming money, except you already have to constantly grind any time you want to explore anywhere in this game focused on exploration to make new tools like ropes (also vines), since the infinite-use grappling hook is inferior to normal ropes while traversing 2D mountains that were intended for a character with x2 jump height when originally implemented, healing items (vines, no matter what tier you make, unless you farm crops for an ultra slow regen buff) or spaceship fuel.

The only late-game way to acquire money without grinding for 30% of your playtime is to slowly kill tanky enemies for pennies, or stack 1000 laggy animals in a corner minecraft style and sell their produce after you harvest by mashing [E] on them for actual minutes

Crafting requires you to stand in front of a workbench doing nothing for several minutes. (you have to wait for a timer to count down before you can craft something else and you have to stay in the crafting window) yet another problem magnified by poor optimization.
You have to do a big-ass 3 hour tutorial to even play the game and you can't skip it.

NPC quests are randomly generated fetch quests with occasional fighting of uninteresting NPCs that always feel the same, and the quests are required to upgrade your ship since they're the only way to recruit crew members. You need to upgrade your ship so you can have space for the 27~ crafting benches you get, and actually decorate your ship.

You frequently need to teleport to waypoint flags, but you have to be at a teleporter, which means you need to beam to your ship, then use the teleporter, which means a series of loading screens that require you to click something every once in a while to actually go where you want, and if you're doing the NPC fetch quests then you need to do the loading screen juggling again to get back to the quest giver, so they can give you the third part of their fetch quest.
There isn't a map to see where you've been in a planet (which is needed, considering how similar every planet is, with miles of barren wasteland and 3 tiny pre-genned structures).
It takes forever to walk anywhere, and you never gain base run speed, unless you barely noticable speed buff items, or use a buggy murder hoverbike you unlock after 30~ hours, since again, the terrain generation wasn't revamped after chucklefish decided to greatly reduce mobility for some reason.

modded starbound is alright though, except the devs keep coming back every 2 years, adding a tiny feature no one wanted, and breaking half the mods which already didn't have great modding support for implementing certain features.",1503818492,1691574978,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Starbound is an excellent game not for its story but for its gameplay, I didn't play it during its beta I bought it on steam on January 29th 2019 and I played it in cracked version before that in 2018. I currently have +300 hours of games on steam and in total I must be around 400/450 hours.

I digress, Starbound is a game with a lot of replayability (maybe as much as Terraria on some points but I'll get to that.) Admittedly the game in Vanilla is rather repetitive after one or two saves and becomes boring with some of its quests, which is why you have to turn to mods. We're lucky Starbound has a huge community active in the modding scene, and even today new mods come out every day, some good, some bad.

With the right modpack or even just friends, the game can become a lot of fun for the price (knowing that it's possible to get it cheaper on certain sites or during sales). I'm currently playing a game with a rather large modpack (Definitive Diverse Universe {Redux} by Kombosabo (a modpack with over 500 mods and still supported by the modpack's creator)) which is also multiplayer compatible.

Starbound is a game where, unfortunately, you don't have to concentrate too much on the story itself but where you have to play as you wish, the game is fun as long as you have a certain imagination, even if I admit that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.

Players can gather resources from different planets to craft weapons, tools, and other items that they need to survive and progress through the game.

Starbound also has a multiplayer mode that allows players to team up with friends or strangers to explore the universe together. This adds a social aspect to the game, making it even more enjoyable to play.

When I would encounter a boss or miniboss, I would think I was going to go through several attempts before actually winning, which I was more than likely correct about. Though it could just sound like I'm not good enough or annoyed with losing, I actually mean it. The way that the character moves is very snappy at times where you would rather be sent a bit farther away from en enemy that hit you rather than get hit and stay in that hitbox to get hit again. The combat of Starbound is surprisingly annoying at times, specifically when you lose all your materials because you died to a random enemy you couldn't fight due to it being a block lower than you when you used your last attack. Also, the game difficulty is made in an odd way. Starbound has a hunger system just like most games today because they apparently get forced into doing so for the ""survival rpg"" type of game. the hunger system can be disabled in the starting menu for a new save, but turning it to that reduced difficulty also disables dropping materials on death. I may have made that part a little spun around, because I like the hunger system but not the inventory dropping on death, so I decide to keep both on because I don't have a choice unless I want to get rid of hunger, which I don't. But then it circles back to my point of the combat being stupidly one-sided in favor of your enemies unless you manage to persevere against a boss multiple times before actually surviving to the end of the fight. If anyone does find this review under the ungodly number of them, you may think that all games are like that where you need to keep trying to beat a boss. No. Starbound has annoyingly difficult bosses where if you don't know what they can and will do, you are no doubt going to have to fight again, which isn't the case in many other games. Other games give you a chance to survive, with slower or telegraphed attacks. Starbound doesn't have a whole lot of telegraphing, and even when it does, some bosses might use the same telegraph for different attacks. You could play a game like Cuphead and survive a run and gun or just a normal boss in one try, though it would be difficult, you would still actually think you could just barely make it past and survive. In Starbound, all the confidence goes out the window. Not to mention that when starting a new save, you have no armor against all those annoying enemies that you don;t have the resources to see in the dark sometimes. Not only that, but you are more likely to find weapons and armor while fighting enemies underground as surface items are unlikely to just show up and reveal themselves to you, meaning in the early game, you HAVE to face unfair enemies. ""well yeah, all games have unfair enemies as you just start. you have nothing good to fight them with."" Really? Look at any game that has an actual tutorial which includes combat tutorials. After the tutorial for combat is finished, you may have a starter sword or something for defense. In starbound, you have the same thing. Problem with that. In those other games, enemies with special attacks that you haven't seen before become more common with the difficulty. In starbound, because it's a sandbox-ish game, they are everywhere in unlimited amounts because all you do is survive. Oh wait, did I say survive? I meant die multiple times, regain your items, get your way over to one special structure underground and die to what's inside. So all and all, starbound is a good game, but due to the fact that the combat is as one-sided as it is, I have to give it a bad review. Oh yeah, I also beat the game already, so I didn't just play for those 31 hours grinding for items, but every goddamn boss had their own hellscape of a structure that you had to go through to actually fight the boss. Sure, there are checkpoints, but there are only 2 of them in each massive dungeon-type thing. The god damn ape boss.",1689972119,1689972119,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The base game, though enjoyable, may not stand out on its own, but thanks to its thriving modding community, Starbound transforms into an exceptional gaming experience.

Pros:

Robust Modding Community: The true magic of Starbound lies within its active modding community. Mods breathe new life into the game, enhancing it beyond imagination. These modifications elevate the game far beyond what the original developers had envisioned.

Diverse Mods: The recommended mods, such as Frackin Universe, Beta Bound, Shellguard Expansion, Arcana, RPG Growth, and Galaxy in Conflict, enrich the game significantly by introducing a plethora of new species, ships, armors, clothing, weapons, quests, pets, and more.

Lackluster Base Game: Without mods, the base game might feel somewhat lackluster and fail to captivate players for extended periods. While it provides a solid foundation, it is the mods that truly unlock the game's potential.

Developer Updates: Some players may find the developer updates a double-edged sword. While these updates may introduce new content and quests, they can also disrupt the mods created by the community, leading to compatibility issues and diminished enjoyment.

Conclusion:
Starbound, with its blend of Terraria and No Man's Sky elements, is an engaging experience, though the true splendor of the game lies in the world of mods. The dedicated modding community ensures that players have an endless supply of creative content and exciting adventures.

It has a bunch of mechanics that look amazing on the surface, and could make for a unique and worthwhile experience! Unfortunately there's nothing more than surface here.

1 You get a ship, but can only expand its size via upgrades (not building) and change some of the interior.

The right way to do this would've been to let us make a ship on the first planet, built uniquely with our own materials in whatever shape worked.

2 You can't land your ship on a planet. If it took up actual space it would be possible.

The solution? Make orbiting a planet take a minuscule amount of fuel. Just enough to incentivise players to build a flat area for landing.

3 The story is bad. Games don't need amazing stories in some cases, but given how linear the boss progression is via the story, it really should've been at least ok.

4 The game is super linear. Yes, if you have fuel you can go wherever and explore, but apart from ores there isn't much to find. I ended up exploring tons of planets and finding cities and airships and the like, but the loot was not very good. This was compounded by the fact that...

5 One of the game's main progression systems is clicking on background objects from different races. This is bad enough already, but let me tell you something. You have to do it in order. Out exploring and find race C's objects? Too bad, you need race A's objects. I hope you remember to come back here when you need race C's objects!

This actively disincentivises exploring anything but the planet you need. I hate this progression system as a whole, but limiting the order you find the objects in makes it way worse.

6 I hate the boss progression. The bosses themselves are good, but the way you get to them is awful. After finally completing a race's objects you get to teleport to the quest planet. These are handmade adventure stages like you'd see in a regular action game. There's puzzles, decent loot, and npcs with dialog. It's alright. It's just such a jarring shift in gameplay that it feels off to play through these sections. At which point you have a decision. Should I run through all of these levels like it's not a space exploration game? Or should I take my time and enjoy building on different planets while ignoring bosses? Neither is a good option.

7 Now about the building... It's fine. It works, you can make some pretty cool things if you try. Unless I'm mistaken however, there's no manual block change item like Terraria's hammer. And some blocks are really expensive and a pain to build with like the different types of stone. Once I place it down it shouldn't take 15 seconds to break. That's lame.

8 Another thing in relation to building is the npcs! You can recruit npcs to your ship (and I think housing on planets) by completing quests! You can even change their vanity to look like your own so everyone matches! THEY DO NOTHING! No basic shops, help with fights, resource collection, nothing at all. So much potential wasted.

9 Finally, the final boss is awful. I'm pretty sure it and the entire game was designed around having a bunch of people. Which isn't always bad, (see Monster Hunter) but in this case the final boss got butchered. I was getting excited, I finally get to beat the game and play something else. The previous bosses were a highlight. (Even if they weren't amazing) But the first phase was kind of lame. That's okay I thought. The second phase will make up for it. THERE WAS NO SECOND PHASE!

Ultimately it was a fitting end for this game. 1 corny credits sequence later, and I'm finally done. There was highlights, like the gnomes and shadow planets, but their appeal was entirely surface level. If you're looking into this game as a Terraria fan, just play modded Terraria instead. If you've never played Terraria, just play Terraria. And if you really don't want to play Terraria right now go for Vintage Story. It's not on steam, but it does work on the Steam Deck.

Don't play this game. It's just alright, maybe even bad. I would not even recommend it on a 95% sale. It's simply not worth your time. Have a good day.

 I liked the dungeons and fighting the bosses the most.
The game is interesting but doesn't feel like it's been fully finished, the devs just abandoned and gave up on it and aren't updating it anymore.

The NPC's  you hire for your ship crew are extremely annoying, they just  stand there and look stupid and lifeless the AI isn't made to look alive and functioning and get in the way even if you put plenty of tables, chairs and beds around or the absolute worse stand right next to a door and whenever you try to open it to go through they continually close it so you have to remove the door to be able to go through. 

I hate how the crew just stand there in the way.
They do sometimes sleep in the beds, sit down or warm themselves at the forge which is annoying as they get in the way when trying to smelt ore. 


I just spent a lot of the game time exploring and creating. Besides that there isn't really much else. NPC quests aren't interesting and feature the same few of give this note and then give the reply or get some iron make some iron bars and give to or plant these seeds, fight some enemy or the worst go find this NPC at the temple and escort them back. The game feels quite lacking unless all you want to do is build and use mods.

After completing all the main missions I had no interest anymore in playing. And will only play when I have nothing else.
There are other things to do but it feels pointless.
Sure you can capture and collect creatures to fight for you but they are all useless and extremely weak in battle, they die after a couple of hits.
Everything else is also tedious and boring and trying to find and collect various things which can take forever and is not at all fun.
Exploring  gets boring as once you've seen all the biomes, it all starts to look the same.
Sure I could build colonies but colonies also seem pointless.

TEP 1
Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.

STEP 2
Sit the 1kg beef fillet on a roasting tray, brush with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with pepper, then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for medium. When the beef is cooked to your liking, remove from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge for about 20 mins.

STEP 3
While the beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnut (and wild, if you like) mushrooms as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. You can use a food processor to do this, but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don’t become a slurry.

STEP 4
Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and 50g butter in a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat, with 1 large sprig fresh thyme, for about 10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture.

STEP 5
Season the mushroom mixture, pour over 100ml dry white wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred.

STEP 6
Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme.

STEP 7
Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 slices prosciutto on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row.

STEP 8
Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over.

STEP 9
Use the cling film’s edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go.

STEP 10
Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry.

STEP 11
Dust your work surface with a little flour. Roll out a third of the 500g pack of puff pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet.

STEP 12
Roll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry to about 28 x 36cm.

STEP 13
Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry.

STEP 14
Beat the 2 egg yolks with 1 tsp water and brush the pastry’s edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet.

STEP 15
Using a rolling pin, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet, pressing well into the sides.

STEP 16
Trim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle.

STEP 17
Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry.

STEP 18
Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.

STEP 19
Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp – 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef, 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick",1643231577,1689277096,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has been one of my all-time favorites during beta. It had so much potential. This is a Terraria-looking like game. So, people who buy it will naturally gonna be sandbox lovers. Who probably would prefer replaying the game with different routes and races every time?

USCM could become an evil faction that you can join and play in some kind of evil organization (But, did USCM has been really evil?) instead of forcing us to become protectors with the 1.0 update. I mean, there should have been pathways, instead of one boring storyline. However, they removed USCM instead of using that potential. Which is a waste... I definitely would keep it as a joinable faction for human characters since it is (or was) a human-based, racist organization. So, I think a human character should have been able to join them.

Also, let's remember that this game has multiple races. As an Apex, I would much prefer to experience civil war between big brother and the resistance. The game should have given us a choice between those two factions for us. That boss battle shouldn't have been our only interaction with apes.

Another thing is that Florans and Hylotl have a bloody past even on current lore. (Which is not even a lore anymore) so why don't we see them act each other in a hostile matter? Florans invaded their home planet and ate them. But we don't see any reference to that between characters. This is unrealistic and disappointing. I mean, this story lonely can create a conflicting storyline for Hylot and Floran characters. Hylots are trying to take their home planet back and Florans trying to keep it. Hell, with the player in the equation, even a Hylot counterattack to Floran home planet would be interesting to see. Just imagine that the imperial Japanese army referenced Hylots are marching to battle. How could I see this and people who work in the game sector don't?

Glitches are another wasted opportunity. AI who achieved self-awareness and eliminated their creator? Can't you see that you can make a storyline that creates a story that could even surpass Detroit here? That could explain why Glitch was stuck in the medieval age even though they achieved space travel.

For Avians, bird people who influenced by Aztec and Egyptians. On their storyline, i would expect to see Mytologic stories. Maybe 'Gods' they fallowed could become other alien races who would try to kill the player because we discovered the trith behind them. We could also try to stop or withness Sacrifices they made, or we could join those 'gods' 

And Novakids are another story, cowboys which became a thing at the very end of the beta test. We don't know anything about them. A storyline that explains their past and even current, while the player makes them 7th race that owned one of the keys to the arch would be possible.

There were lots of random human and ape laboratories on planets. Becoming a mad scientist and unlocking special items, technology, and stuff would also be amazing for players that choose that path.

Also, why don't we see any home planets? Why most of the planets are in liveable condition? In the universe planets that let you live in them are extremely rare and it should have been the same case here. 

I just imagined home planets in some of the storylines that I wrote. So, some storylines could make them useful. Even Earth's ruins would be nice to see. And there Could be Human colonies on Mars (I'd also put an Elon Musk easter egg there) which, would have been a possible home planet for Humans in the storyline. It also could give you another thing, ""Biosfer Tech"" which could be a way to create life on hostile planets. That could create a colonizer storyline. Your purpose would be to create life on unliveable planets.

Additionally, since I mentioned such a system, in the end game this tech could evolve into terraforming tech. Which could give nonevil path characters a chance to fix Earth's ruins. 
For others -and maybe all-, a change to turn certain kinds of planets (such as Mars) into liveable planets with their ecosystems in the end. And, maybe for evil characters to turn liveable planets into non-liveable

I just gave a single storyline for each race in this summary, along with some ideas of mine that I had since I first saw this game here. The writers of the main story I believe that they could add many more storylines to this. This could improve replayability with a different race and a different storyline in every game. But they choose to make it something bland instead. Which wasn't the case during beta. I mean USCM had a projection of DeathStar (Yes the one from Star Wars) on their secret bases on some planets. I personally can see a planet destroyer evil dictatorship here.

Shortly, this game did not realize its potential and wasted itself in a manner that makes me so sad to see. Because current this there is no difference between different races and there is only one storyline for anyone who plays regardless of their race.",1472367677,1688993356,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Love this game. Pretty normal sandbox. Progression is mostly based on your gear. Endgame tends to focus very much on creativity and base building imo. If you're the type that can immerse yourself and create emergent stories as you play, you will probably have a better time than someone that needs to be constantly fed objectives. 

The writing is probably the weakest part, but even that is masterful in its own way. The story takes itself seriously enough, but also pokes enough fun to keep things amusing. Even little blurbs given by the NPC can be quite hilarious, since you'll have villagers on a fiery planet of doom that say things like ""help. I cannot defend myself"" when they're being attacked by a bird.

I remember, when I first tried it, I was really pulled in to how unique and mysterious EVERY species felt. Finding ruins/settlements/enemy camps felt like an adventure, not only because of the npc encounter, be it combat or friendly, but because you had to try to piece together the cultural influences and specifics for each species. This, in my opinion, left the world up to a lot more interpretation. 

Now, this is simply what I miss, maybe influenced mainly by some form of nostalgia I feel that apart from mainly visual aspects and weapon styles, the once very unique species have blended together (apart from the lore, but not everybody reads everything).

However, I do still recommend the game, it is addicting and replayable, even more so if you prefer the game to as how it is now or simply didn't experience the mystique created by the unfinished world it once had.

Do not be fooled, it is not 2d space minecraft or a terraria/risk of rain 1 clone.

The game has successfully held my interest for years, with a world as interesting and complex as this, it has every right to be a good game. It's story is very linear, which isn't necessarily a problem if done right, however Starbound does not do it right, and the story itself isn't very good either. Though, that's not why you'll play the game anyway. It draws a lot of influence from Terraria, which is definitely not a bad thing, though it focuses more on the building and exploration aspects. Unfortunately, Starbound suffers from ""HORRIBLE EXECUTIVES"" syndrome. The heads of Chucklefish were not paying their less experienced developers, which is a whole other can of worms, but when called out on this, their responce was to stop developing Starbound for some reason they said it was to help catch a ""sexual predator"", but this was timed very coincidentally right alongside the accusations gained traction. This is why I say it has POTENTIAL. The game is good in it's current state, but that's all, just good. It COULD be great, if Chucklefish would only keep developing it. However, all that has been about vanilla. If you are to get Starbound, download the mod ""frackin universe"" from the workshop, it fixes the story issues i mentioned earlier.

It's less boss oriented and more sandbox. Instead of just one world you have virtually infinite planets that you can link together and teleport between, with your ship serving as an intermediate space which you can also expand and build on (although not to the same extent as the planets). If you find yourself visiting a planet frequently enough and you have the resources (and trust me, it's not cheap), you can even place a teleporter so you don't have to beam to your ship, although beware that you won't be able to remove it thereafter without destroying it.

That's not to say there are not bosses and interesting combat mechanics; there are. It's just not what you may be used to. For instance, weapons are either one-handed or two-handed, depending on whether they have a built-in secondary ability, so one-handed weapons tend to be more flexible, whereas two-handed weapons are generally more powerful. The ranged weapons use energy in much the same way as terraria's magic weapons use mana, but unlike terraria, pretty much all armor offers boosts to your energy capacity. 

Bosses are also different, but not so much in combat as in how you encounter them. Unlike terraria, you don't just summon a boss by using an item, but rather you must complete a sort of dungeon that resets if everyone in it dies, much like a party wipe in an instanced encounters in games like WoW. There will usually be a checkpoint before the boss though, so you can keep trying as long as you have resources to keep trying. (It's also easy enough to spawn in items if you get desperate, although obviously that's considered cheating. I may or may not have done this to get through my first encounters with bosses 2, 3 and 4, but in my defense I have a spinal cord injury so the fact I'm able to play at all is a testament to modern technology...)

All in all, whether you see this as a new twist on the general concept of terraria or a game of its own is irrelevant. It is a VERY good game and I've barely played anything else since I bought it. 9.8/10",1511887075,1688192719,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Starbound captures better than any game I've played the grandeur and freedom of exploring space. A planet can be calm and serene, brimming with life, or intimidatingly inhospitable; each is a little different, and exploring them never gets old.

Fans of lore and stories will enjoy the thought put into each NPC race, fans of exploration will enjoy the different planet types and structures, fans of collecting will enjoy breaking and shelving everything in sight. There's farming, monster collecting (think pokemon), terraforming, space mech piloting, instrument playing, and so much more.

Mods (while some have not kept up with updates and are deprecated) can tweak gameplay or entirely rework the game's mechanics.

If the game looks appealing and you're worried about complaints--don't be. There's a mod for almost any problem you might have. Inventory too small? Mod for that. Crew experience underwhelming? Mod for that. Clothing system restrictive? Mod for that. Block/furniture recipes too hard to collect? Mod for that. You get my point. 
I think any real complaint would boil down to the ethics of the developer. Chucklefish has been embroiled in a pretty shady exploitation scandal regarding the development of this game. I can't tell you how to rationalize that one, but I will say that this is one of my favorite games ever, and I don't throw that distinction around.

The one thing that brings me back over and over to Starbound over other games is the atmosphere it creates. No other game captures the feeling of space quite like Starbound. Space, and the planets you discover in it, can feel peaceful and secluded (the soundtrack does wonders in this department).",1688191436,1688191436,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Personal thought:
This game was really fun to play with my friend and we had much fun exploring the world and building our base. It was especially fun to defeat all of the bosses and uncover the story! However this game does not have good replayability, its just the same each run, but still a good game! 9/10

The game is very grindy, but it's not as fun as terraria grinding, which I why I didn't start a new world. I would have to re-grind through 20 hours of gameplay, and while the game was fun, it wasn't fun enough to make me want to redo all of that progress.

The problem is that while story progress is saved through your individual characters, the world's itself are all connected. Ex - playing on a new character and want to bring it to your other character's base planet? Just put the coordinates for that planet on your ship and you'll fly straight there. The only problem is that this means you can't transfer individual characters or worlds through pcs, so all my progress is stuck on my old DELL in the basement (OR, I'm just a dumbass who couldn't figure out how to transfer it).

I have played this game a long time and a long time ago via other means ( not from steam store ).
Back in the days the story was a bit different and i enjoyed it. The story is a bit short granted, but i still like it even with the changes since so many years ago.

The Bountyhunter addition is really nice, and if you have no patience there is admin mode so you do not NEED to craft and all that just to see whats coming.

The Sprites are great, sounds are very pleasant and overall the design is pretty.
Technically there could be some improvements, especially when you go fast in game even with vanilla augments/vehicles the environment generation on planets sometimes loads slowly even on high end PCs, i don't know why, maybe the engines does not load the files fast enough?


The game is mod friendly you can do almost anything with mods AND even in vanilla you can kinda ""mod"" this game via chat commands. ( /spawnitem and variables such as dps, accuracy, altfire etc.. you can literally put anything in here and there are guides to it even.. just look for Starbound vanilla itemspawn codes on ""starbounder"" stub )

The only complain i would have is that there are only 4 sloped blocks in game, and if one does not want to mod that is very limiting.

In general i would like an ingame block designer but that's just me.
________________
I recommend playing the game just as it is, no mods no admin mode for the first time, focus on playing the story and meeting the gear requirement by normally playing, crafting and all that.

After that, go in admin mode and explore what you do. Especially because there is a lot of content you can spawn that isn't ""there"" by default. (starbounder: unobtainable items)
________________
What i do not recommend is going to other servers.
Here is why... you can literally add ANYTHING just by /spawnitem, this means you can construct a gun that can destroy even protected tiles, augments that make you fly or have an aura that destroys anything on the planet...SO lets say i have spawned myself my sniper rifle, which can use altfire to fire an orb that destructs block and blocks that are protected, i can take this with me on any server and go havoc. Due to human nature there will be people doing this, and maybe destroy your planet... that's why i do not recomment going anywhere except your own server. But this is no problem with the game, its a human problem.

Pros: Nice Story, a lot of things to do, complex crafting, farming, exploring, crew, pets, mods, admin, calming atmosphere...

The reason people get angry is because it is like comparing Minecraft to Terraria, their only similarity is that they are games, and the up until recently novel voxel based environment system. 
Terraria is about boss battles, its how you progress. Starbound is about exploration. You will do a few boss battles, but they aren't the point of the game. 
Exploring new worlds gathering new materials, creating and finding new gear is the point. There is a real story, there are too many planets to explore. Each playthrough will be different based on what weapons you use or what things you find early. 
For Example, there are many types of trees. They can have dozens of log materials and many leaf materials. Finding a giant root tree early is very good. You can take its saplings and replant them on your farm world for an easy fiber supply for medical and rope usage. Having an abundance of it compleatly changes how you move around the world because you care far less about damage and are free to sling around the map like spiderman on grapple hook ropes.
Finding a good weapon you like with a good modifier you prefer also will change how you fight. Like spears, go for it, like comboing enemies to death with a broadsword, upgrade the one you have.
Another thing I like is that almost all the materials that you gather are useful throughout the whole game. You don't stop using copper, or coal, just find more uses for them.

You can go from planet to planet, system to system. Just like No Man's Sky.
You can obtain a Mech that is just like one from Titanfall or a Gungdam. 
At the end of the game you can do these Vaults over and over and obtain cool treasure, started by obtaining a vault key. Sounding similar to Borderlands.
There's farming you can do which gives me Stardew Valley vibes.
You can create colony's by making homes for settlers to move in.

Honestly I recommend this game, it has a lot to offer and it is still being updated to this day. I come back from time to time to try out new things from recent updates. I'm happy I've had the chance to play this game and make it a part of my childhood throughout the years and up to now.

most deduction of points come from its performance, handling of containers and handling of large ships (which it doesnt like.) not being able to overlap the objects, bc they all share the same space and you practically only have walls and objects make is less ""artistically free"" than terraria. the progression is more linear and repetitive.

It's a good game. 
After you've played it once or twice, though? Would heavily, HEAVILY recommend modding it if you plan to play again.
It's literally as simple as pressing Subscribe on the mod, closing Starbound, and re-opening it.

If your PC specs aren't too high tho, i'd recommend skipping over Frackin Universe. 
I love the mod
But oh my goodness it did NOT like my previous PC

Starbound in itself is terribly optimized (due to some BIOS settings or so I've heard) and honestly a game you probably need a gamer level PC to constantly play. Mine is one I would consider a gamer PC but I didn't build it myself so it's probably not TOO high end... but it's not a laptop struggling not to take off into space using it's internal fans lol

It's fun and I'm getting my money's worth...
But yeah, no future updates from the creators, almost necessary mods in order to have fun after the first playthrough, and a community who will almost never play multiplayer means that you're going to get bored quickly unless you have the level of patience I have.

You'll probably play it for 100 hours and get bored. I, on the other hand, plan to install every mod in existence (/jk) apparently because I keep grabbing more and more as they release lol. 

Also the Evertournivac mod or whatever it's called is really fun. Would recommend it for playthrough 2+",1686220416,1686220416,True,1,0,0,2,True,False,False

If you're considering buying this game, go for it! It has a metric boat load of mods on the Workshop, you can even find mods outside that are just as easy to install like they are in the Workshop.
  As for the story, it has some real nice story telling, it does take time to get to each part, as you need to scan things to progress, but there are also side missions to allow you to get MORE things.
  There is one thing I like the most about this game, if you try to give yourself an item, but you miss spell it, or it isn't in the game, it gives you a Perfectly Generic Item, which can also be obtained after the main story to craft the best armor in the entire game.
  Overall, just play it, if you like 2D sandboxes like Terraria, you'll love starbound, I do recommend getting a mod from the Workshop that halves fall damage or removes it entirely, as the fall damage is too over the top, you can fall from a height equal to walking off your roof and you'll lose over 80% of your health",1647988810,1686191935,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

I have a few modest reservations about this game, but if you like terraria, I -highly- suggest this game. There's a ton of items, and instead of bosses, you get sort of 'story dungeons' that lead to bosses. The story is very 'get the 7 whatevers to access the door to defeat the cosmic baddy' Not terribly inventive, but honestly, the focus is the building anyway. And boy howdy, there are a LOT of items for building.

However, be warned, this game on -some systems- are awful for FPS. My home computer that is 8+ years old, runs like a dream, it's perfect. On my laptop from last year, garbage, like 6 FPS. I'm not sure how you could know if your system will or won't work, but you will know the moment you start a new game, well within steam's return policy.

My only gripe is that there isn't really a clear indication about how some things progress. For instance, A) you make different types of food to learn more food recipes, but that doesn't always apply to other things. It's not clear which do work like that and which don't B) To increase the amount of items you can print, you scan them, but not everything scanned can be printed but there's no indication on which can and can't. C) Some items you expect to find can only be purchased and nothing really tells you that. D) Alternatively, some items found used to have a use and now don't so they are pointless and nothing tells you that so you just hang on to them thinking it'll be relevant later.

This gripes are pretty minor after 275 hours of gameplay. I still highly suggest it.",1686067934,1686067934,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the one hand, it's a perfectly ""nice"" game with quaint graphics and a hint of nostalgia. The idea of being able to dig and build across a large and unusual galaxy is novel in its approach.

On the other hand though, the implementation is lacklustre. The combat mechanics are terrible and the penalty for death is absurdly high which makes it all the more irritating when you go up against a boss or visit a planet for the first time to discover just how under geared you are. 

The building system is unoriginal and uninspiring. Given that there are crafting stations and shops all over the place there is no incentive to invest any real time into building a base or even kitting out your ship and the grind for gathering materials is soul destroying. On many occasions I've had to stop playing because the boredom of having to search ANOTHER planet for whatever ore I'm grinding to move on to the next tier has become overwhelming.

The tier system itself is very poorly planned. Unlike Terraria ( a game which is often used as the benchmark for this type of game ) where the progression feels very smooth and the penalty for dying is not so significant, the space between the tiers in Starbound is way too large and requires far too much grinding.

The mech was again a nice idea but really poorly implemented. After hours of finding all of the blueprints to get the best available parts for my tier, only to be killed within seconds as soon as you progress is really frustrating. 

The TLDR: Starbound has some nice ideas which I truly wish the developers had managed to do something with, but sadly the implementation of these ideas is awful and after 70 hours of trying to find things to keep my interest, it's time to give up and move on to a game that's had more effort put in.",1685719127,1685719127,False,11,0,0.556512951850891113,0,True,False,False

Without any prior exposure, something that instantly struck me was just how big the world of [i]Starbound[/i] is. With little more than a couple of tools and the elements against me, there was never an end of things to discover, unlock, or create. The crafting mechanics lend themselves well to someone who never grew up playing Minecraft. Even in the early game, there are endless possibilities.

And it just grows from there. As you upgrade your character and ship, the planets and space available to explore stretch out indefinitely. Just when I thought I'd hit the game's ceiling, something new and vast would open up to reveal worlds without number. The universe is so big, I doubt I could ever truly witness all of the wonders the developers coded into existence. But I sure am going to have a lot of fun trying.

You'll definitely want to keep the game wiki close by. There's a lot to figure out on the fly. But on the whole, the game does a pretty decent job of walking you through the basics early on. There are an unlimited number of ways to approach the game and no set story you have to follow (though there is one contained in the core objectives, if you choose to follow it).

Then the game released and a lot of the potential wasn't there anymore, and a story mode was added that nobody asked for, and while not the worst, was horribly executed.

This game cant stand on its own without mods, and even then, the game has performance issues that mods cant fix. I use to be able to play this game perfectly fine on an old laptop until it was fully released, now I cant without the game freezing every time I pick up an item or interact with anything, and my current PC isn't weak at all and I still have these issues.

Combat is generic and basic, unless you get a overpowered weapon, a lot of fights are more tedious then fun, and there's barely any variety at all. All the weapons are generic sci-fi themed, with the melee weapons having the worse designs in my opinion. Which is upsetting considering back in beta, the weapons looked better, and there were unique racial weapons for each race. Why they removed these and replaced all of it with generic items that aren't pleasing to look at or use, I don't know.

Exploration starts off great, but slowly becomes very repetitive, and not in a good way. If you explored one type of world then you've explored all those types of worlds. The only unique things on these planets are the structures, and there's barely any variety at all. The terrain is too random too use a hover vehicle with since the mountains are either too high or there's way too many large openings in the ground for it to fall into and get stuck. The Mech is slow and bulky on ground it isn't worth using either. Running around normally is the only good way to explore, except the fact that this game has an unhealthy amount of enemies that spawn, especially at night, which makes exploring a planet incredibly annoying.

The building is, actually very fun, excluding mods, this is the one saving grace this game has honestly. Its not better then what Terraria has, but it comes close with its decorations and furniture.

This game lacks progression, its similar to Minecraft in the sense that you decide the goal and what to do. With the story being boring and extremely repetitive, and bounty hunting being the exact same pretty much, the only goals this game has is what you can come up with. You can easily ignore the story and bounty hunting entirely without any issues, especially if you already ""beat"" the game before, since the entire Outpost is unlocked with all the characters present with a new, fresh character, since the Outpost is a world file and is the same each time. Depending on who you are and how you enjoy games, this can either be a good thing or a bad thing depending on if you like making your own goals and progression, or if you'd rather have a set goal to work towards like in Terraria or other games similar.

The publisher of this game also has drama attached to them, screwing over people who helped work on the game and then proceeded to not credit or pay them for the time and effort spent. Nor keep the promise of hiring them afterwards, leaving these freelance devs to rot pretty much despite the promises that were made.

I'd only get this game if you wanna play with mods, I know I have a ton of hours on this game but a bulk of it is from beta and when the game didn't have this freezing issue. This game is only still alive thanks to its wonderful community.

starbound sure you will get very exited at first hour to 10 hours (not focus on main quest) things start to get boring weapons and armors are really just plain and straight forward what's the point of having 3 add-ons of weapon crafting table to represent classes? gunner, melee, and mage something like that?. armor have no bonus or anything just purely stats at least give it some bonus skill or progressive armor for classes.

Weapons they are quite ok but there are no exiting feeling like any other game when you get legendary weapon or crafting new weapon it just nothing. maybe because crafting weapon is so boring when i was playing it i have no idea this game have classes until i got to lastest weapon crafting table upgrade. and if you want to craft new weapons and unique weapons? good luck finding weapon blue print in chests and not just that you have to find other base weapon to craft it instead of craft it from material and monster drop you have to looking for weapon and upgrade it to new version of it just like upgrading swords in terraria but in unreasonable way.

 how about instead of people have to open every boxes in whole world to get a blue print that isn't even worth time of finding.instead change it to get from quests from outpost or special NPCs to get unique weapon blue print is sound more fun and interesting .

Bosses only mainstory and vault bosses just that most important part of 2D RPG sidescroller games get least attention even won the bosses i don't feel like i achieved something just only be able to progess furthur at least have some boss event or boss spawn item and give boss some meaning than just progress and a rare drop per boss how about make them drop resource related to them and be able to craft new weapon or armor (this is very basic concept for RPG game) and lack of bosses contents just make game progress  very boring. to be honest boss isn't even give intense feeling when i was fighting it


END GAME content it's failure i saved universe and all i can do is go to vault dungeon and upgrade very few weapons and terraform planet? end game player have merged with protector soul which it should have to changed appearance of matter manipulator or at least option to change it appearance between artifact one and normal one it just not making any sense

this game is lack tons of content only thing that i consider it's finish is monster they all have ability specially elementals monster but bosses, weapons, armors and pretty much alot of things are unfinish and game lastest update is 3 years ago???!!!! this game pretty much like dead game it got noting worth replay because it feel like game is undone

Now we're looking at a finished game, a release version.   It's fantastic.   After the release of 1.0, I more or less doubled my in-game hours from the beta.  This game is amazing, and a lot of fun.  

I don't want to spoil too much, as much of it is a game of discovery as well as creativity.   But it is everything thet devs said it would be.  And that alone is worth supporting.

Some might compare it to if Terarria and No Man's Sky had a baby.   It really does offer endless fun, and the modability doesn't just add to that, but multiplies it.

So many missing features that would be obvious in a sci-fi setting, or just in a game in general. ie. mini map, jump jets, better storage options (than effing chests), more vehicle and armour/weapon options (WTF is with medieval armour?!), no ability to break down tech or items, no creative ways of catching things, no good guide on crafting let alone anything else. And thats just off the top of my head... sooo many missed opportunities. PAINFUL death and item retrieval with very little tech to aid in exploration or finding stuff. 1/3 of money lost on death - just gone, no way of getting that back at all. So, I just die over and over, and havent bothered with the shops. I could sell all the shit I make, but why? 
Awkward movement that doesnt improve much, very little in the way of mini bosses. Same monsters on different planets in different solar systems - wtf?! Fuck - the more I think about this game the more I hate it.

Aside from a sandbox, the game has its own loot system, side quests, a kind of parkour, mechs, and vehicles. A lot of different and unique places to explore, such as dungeons, catacombs, civilizations, research centers, tombs, challenge rooms, hostile and friendly spaceships, space stations, planets... A TON of items: melee/ranged weapons, shields, decorations, musical instruments, food, poke-balls, and many others. We can also have pets, our civilizations full of NPCs, and crew members for our own spaceship (that can be upgraded later).

At the beginning of the game, the interface is a bit awkward, but over time it becomes very intuitive. Your progress will be very slow too, but over time and upgrades, nothing will stop you from doing anything. The gameplay, once we repair our ship, will leave us free. From there we can loot all we can, make huge civilizations, complete side quests & the main story, build whatever we want, travel and meet new places and civilizations,  be hired for search and capture of criminals, or just stay on our spaceship and sort all the things we have obtained previously. There are also boss fights. If we get bored, we can put mods!

I recommend to play it on the easy difficulty since you don't lose items when you die, and you don't need to eat to stay alive. It can be very frustrating to lose a lot of things when it happens. And if that the case you can lose interest in this game.

[h1] Pros [/h1]

+ One of the best pixel 2D graphics.
+ Original and relaxing music that changes to intense if we meet a boss.
+ Our own spaceship (We can expand it and hire crew members).
+ 7 species to choice between (Your spaceship look and pet depends on what you've chosen).
+ Our own mech, which we can deploy whenever we want and use it to sabotage hostile spaceships.
+ An incredible amount of biomes.
+ A TON of items.
+ A massive arsenal, range, and melee. Each weapon has its elemental damage.
+ We can visit and make civilizations.
+ We can explore an infinite universe without limitations.
+ We can explore, fight and loot a lot of places, enemies and items.
+ We can catch the fauna inhabitants of the planet with poke-balls.
+ We can play music with a big variety of musical instruments.
+ We can make collections of bugs, pets, fishes, books, food, auction figures, and fossils.
+ We can play with our friends.
+ Fishing.
+ Ability to put mods.

[h1] Cons [/h1]

- Too much grind.
- There are no spaceship fights.
- Without friends, it's less playable, but you can still enjoy it.
- It can be too addictive.

[h1] Is it worth it [/h1]

As you can read above, this game has a huge content. We can start enjoying this game as soon as we have familiarized with UI and upgraded fair enough our multi-tool, and skills. After playing for about 10-15 hours, it will be much easier for us to fight, explore and do other things. At first, it is a bit difficult, but it is worth the time spent. So is worth it!

At first, Starbound seemed quite complicated (coming from Terraria, of course), but once I understood the mechanics, Starbound got more exciting down the road/travels.

Yeah, not only can I go deeper into one world, but I can also [u]go to other solar systems[/u] and dig in different planets for materials to my heart's content or colonize; possibilities are almost endless. 

Once you get your spaceship back up and running, you can farm to end-game equipment without progressing on the story; [spoiler]besides the quest to get your spaceship up and running again.[/spoiler] Pretty cool if you like to prep yourselves for the upcoming explorations and not have to farm for them later on; it makes things a lot easier.

It is highly recommended to all players! NPCs can become your companions under specific criteria, either with friends or playing solo, so you are never alone in Starbound (virtually). The Soundtrack is soothing while building a home/settlement, depending on the planet's condition.

211820,68640405,76561198112674559,292,4,6976,0,6976,1586898855,"[b]TLDR[/b]: the game had potential, but the end result is very lacking. Every element of the game is designed to steal your time, giving you an illusion that you have something to do, but you essentially stare at the screen holding one button waiting for something to happen. Some artworks are cool looking, but there are not that many of them and they start repeating very early into the game. 

With more than a hundred hours with this game - very little of it was actually worth the time spent. The overall experience is very shallow and extremely slow. People who compare it to Terraria clearly have never played Terraria, because Starbound is a shell of a game. I bought this game way back in early access and it still feels like an unfinished alpha version rather than a complete game. Initially I just wrote it off as ""It's in early access still, devs will polish it up eventually"", but after I decided to try it again much later - I was baffled at the complete lack of fun. Almost nothing changed from the alpha, and things that were added are on the same lacking level of polish as the elements that were not changed since alpha.

jUsT uSe MoDs - how about I get an actual game when I pay for it instead of an 'engine' to play mods on? The fact that so many people say that you need mods to play this game only reinforces the fact that the game itself is bad. Mods are supposed to enhance the game, not to make a game playable in the first place.

[b]Gameplay[/b] is extremely slow paced. There are no good movement options. You eventually get some movement techs and even a hoverbike, but they are still slow. That would not be a problem if the world was diverse, if there were things to find, places to explore. Alas, every planet is the same: same structures, same mobs, same terrain consisting of flat land and 1 or 2 mountains.

[b]Combat[/b]: before you get decent armor and weapons almost every mob removes half your health on hit, and even when you eventually upgrade - you have to go to more dangerous planets, where mobs remove half your health again. It is easy to stun and knockback them, which enforces a single viable playstyle: hit and run. There is no variety in weapons, and the amount of energy you have limits how fast you can kill any mob. stretching every fight into eternity.

There is a crapton of [b]downtime[/b]. Flying between planets take an extremely long time. Ship has to change orientation, play hyperspeed animation, and change orientation again. That amounts to 30 to 60 seconds of time where you can't do anything but decorate your ship or craft. Slow mining, aforementioned slow movement and lack of exploration variety makes the game 85% downtime where you do nothing or hold one button while moving or mining with nothing else happening.

[b]Inventory and hotbar[/b] are horrific. You cannot use items from inventory: you have to move item to your hotbar and use it. Very fun when you have 10 blueprints and you can't even tell which ones you already have. Hotbar has a very limited amount of slots, it is very far from inventory, and its slots are extremely small, turning inventory management into a nightmare.

[b]The story[/b] is terrible. Plot is meaningless, lazily written and terribly executed. [spoiler]Big Bad out of nowhere destroys the planet of the Big Good guys and you are the only survivor, then absolutely nothing happens until the very end where you teleport to the Big Bad and kill it. No flavor, no connection, no explanations for anything, no progression beyond ""go collect these 15 unrelated things so you can activate this ancient teleport"".[/spoiler] And of course, every story event has SLOW UNSKIPPABLE ""CUTSCENE"" WITH NO USEFUL INFORMATION IN IT. Cutscene in quotes because those are not even cutscenes, its just an image of an NPC sprite on a black background and nothing else happening, padding that downtime even more.

Developers keep adding 'new' systems, but they never expand on them, or even finish them.
[b]Inspect[/b]: adds absolutely nothing meaningful to the game. Basically an additional descriptor for some decorations that you have to spend extra time to access.
[b]Moons[/b]: I actually remember using wood and coal for ship in alpha version, and it was still more fun than moon fuel gathering. There's just one single line from the ship AI that ""there are weird readings from every moon in the universe"". Now every single moon has an unkillable 'ghost' that always chases you, giving you a limited time to collect fuel. Except you can collect some, return to the ship, and then do it again on the same moon. In short: they took out natural accumulation of fuel from mining\exploration and replaced it with a timesink to pad that playtime.
[b]Mercenaries[/b]: another flavor of companions, except with no bonuses. Straight downgrade.
[b]Mechas[/b]: literally a single layout for space battles and 3 enemy types that take 50 shots each to kill. No depth to the battles at all: you have tons of HP and every enemy drops a refill,  and it takes forever to go through enemies because weapons deal so little damage. A frustrating time sink.
[b]Archaeology[/b]: randomized collectathon. Kind of okay on paper, actually, just not my thing. More of that instead of downtime please.
[b]Hunger and cooking[/b]: you don't know how much hunger food restores or what bonus effect (if any) food grants. Way too many different recipes, feels more like another collectathon + time sink instead of something more engaging.
[b]Colony management[/b]: feels very undercooked. NPCs sometimes give quests and pay rent, but neither really matters.
[b]Random NPC quests[/b]: literaly just 3 quests: kill someone, escort someone, talk to someone. No variety, investment, or even good rewards. There is no reason to do any of it.
[b]Bounty Hunter[/b]: an abomination system stitched from the worst parts of every other mechanic. [strike]Random[/strike] Identical quests [strike]with detective elements[/strike] where you just spend several minutes to use 'inspect' on everything in the building and [strike]chases[/strike] 90% of travel downtime. And of course, the introduction has and unscippable cutscene with nothing of value in it.
[b]Missions[/b]: actually really good, in a way. Interesting to explore the first time, and has a metroidvania elements where certain areas are unreachable until you unlock better movement tech. Who would have thought that carefully designed content is almost always better than an ocean of randomly generated stuff. Still has its problems though: mobs are still overbeefed to hell, and there isn't really a reason to do each mission more than once (or twice if you want to reach every hidden chest and area).

[b]Optimisation[/b]. Given that 2D games do not need GPU or a lot of processing power - I hoped that at least I could play it on my laptop that only has i5 processor. Despite seemingly having nothing complex or demanding - the game still manages to stutter, lag, and have a lot of graphic artefacts while comparatively larger games run with no issues.

[b]In conclusion[/b]: my most optimistic take is that the game has lots of different systems, but none of them polished enough to be compelling in any major way. It feels like the developers were just going through a checklist of every know game-system, adding a barebones version of it, and then never addressing it ever again. On paper all of them add at least some flavor to the game overall, but none of the elements stand out and it turns the game as a whole into a bland mess. [i]Some[/i] things are [i]kind of[/i] neat, but not good enough to justify the time investment required for any of them.
The more pessimistic take is that the game is deliberately designed to pad the playtime as much as possible for every drop of low-quality content it has, with artwork candy and (long gone) hype as boosters.",1588716574,1682631779,False,30,5,0.672368645668029785,4,True,False,False

wow was I a tryhard back then lol
anyways, games and lead devs still suck, but fun new fact!

starbound was created by a team of ""volunteers"" and UNPAID ""interns"" ! who haven't seen a CENT of the cash generated.

do not buy this game. if you feel the need to get this game, FIND ANOTHER METHOD! do NOT support CHUCKLEFUCK.

anyways old edits still left below haha

------------------------------

EDIT November 8, 2020, 1199 HOURS LATER ACCORDING TO STEAM: Game still sucks. This review is very old, all the problems still exist or have been made worse. Chucklefish literally spat in the face of the community by removing CORE FEATURES on the 1.0 launch and then panicked and suddenly ""were able"" to re-add them when people started demanding refunds. Chucklefish told the roleplay community, to it's face, that it wasn't valid and that this was a survival game only... when survival coop still lags to hell and back and having three people on a planet will lag to hell and back without a bunch of mods and outside fixes. Hum...

Just get Terraria or Stardew Valley if you want a good, stable game with an actually decent story. Hell, Minecraft's got a better story then this. Have you seen the scrapped story pieces that they tossed during the beta because /roleplayers were using it as sources for developing deep and interesting cultures/? God FORBID interesting lore!! Oh, and let's not mention they scrapped individual intros in favor of whatever this horrid protectorate storyline. Yuck. There was so much potential that a large community loved, but Chucklefuck panicked because roleplayers weren't ""playing the game right"" and tossed it all away. (this isn't all just me assuming or making stuff up: there were full on-threads about this on the chucklefish forums where devs openly admitted they didn't want a community of roleplayers, it was a survival game, just try playing it right maybe???? ofc they deleted the evidence, chucklefish could neeevvverrrr do anything wrooonnggg... sigh. fun protip to future game devs: if literally, by poll, 80% of your community is there to do a certain playstyle, don't try to disable that playstyle in a mad panic bc it wasn't the game's original intent!!! I don't know why I should have to say that!!)

The cool randomly generated weapons? Haha, don't exist now, each and every one has a set sprite so you can't find cool unique guns/swords anymore. Interesting race lore? Literally only exists through the few books that made the cut; a lot of stuff has been ""toned down"" so the cool depths of each culture just can be summerized in one sentence now.. Wow. So cool. Exploring is still boring; once you've seen a building once, you've seen it in varying states of decay a million times. Creatures got cut too; now most of them are just the same preset basic ones, with only a handful of rng'd creatures per planet.

A shell of what it could have been. A reminder of the failings of many actual legit professionals.

A reminder of horrible, horrible devs and a horribly unstable game.

here's the old review in my baby state of absolute incarnated rage at the very existance of the game, I wasn't clear on my points nor explained them well but they're still valid
(but seriously, just pick up Terraria instead and mod it a lil, it'll be a far funner expirence)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, listen up. I've been playing this game for a long time, and I've got to stay this:
The only reason, the only goddamn reason I played for so long was because of the communities I was in and the mods I could install. None of the core features do ANYTHING for me. Combat is boring- get rushed than quickly get killed, or have a good weapon and one-shot things. The healing system sucks. Oh, and did I mention ACID RAIN that gathers on the ground as POISON POOLS? I understand it is nice and colorful, but there's no meaning unless you toss mods or a nice roleplay community into the mix.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+You have different races and ships to choose from! Cool! Wow! Yeah, that died out quickly.
+Randomly generated planets(for the most part, see 'Cons' below) and enemies.
+Randomly generated.. weapons? O.. okay?

[h1]Neutrals[/h1]
=They screwed up the modding community and keep doing so EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING. UPDATE. Oh, and they also screw over servers too. Hey, you want someone to make a gun that ignores hitboxes, destories blocks in a 10000 block radius instantly, and to place down unbreakable block while PREVENTING SERVERS FROM BANNING IPS? Yeah, yeah. We all see who's side you're on, Chucklefish. You're on the griefer's side.
=Griefers and hackers storm multiplayer. The only reason I'm not putting this as a con is because some of them can be kinda funny and actually interact with the community. Example: Some guy's placing unbreakable sewage blocks. Someone makes fun of his choice to put lava in the sewage after trapping someone. He, the nameless griefer, states in chat 'well let's make it a dirty job than!'.. and puts poison water instead. Actually was worth a laugh, despite the endless loop of dying.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
-Chucklefish empowers griefers and inhibits servers.
-Chucklefish keeps changing it's goddamn base code so that modders have to learn a new custom language and completely rework mods EVERY SINGLE UPDATE! May you rest in peace Starbound Save Editor. You were killed by the heartless chuckling fish.
-You need mods to customize your character beyond the base color. Without SBSE, you need to recolor EVERY SINGLE PIXEL using Starcheat or do another method- either way, it's tedious and annoying.
-Weapons can attack once every .0001 second and can do up to 7,000,000 damage per hit while ignoring armor. Oh, and did I mention Chucklefish got rid of the IP banning feature? 'Cause, they did. They screwed a lot of people over.
-Server stability. It used to crash every five minutes and they've managed to reduce that to every twenty minutes- oh, but it still lags like hell, chat will freeze up sometimes so it stops working until someone restarts the server, and you need grade-A computers to be able to stand being on a planet with ten people on it standing completely still. Mining? Ohohoh, the server can't stannnnddd that. Don't even THINK about survival co-op!
-Early access for over four years..? I mean, I bought it when it was cheap and a looong time ago, back when it was still a 'new' game, but.. I don't see any improvement? Okay, you screwed over the modding community a few times. Okay, you screwed over custom weapons more than once. Okay, you ruined server security. What's next? Are they going to take away the ability to ban people completely and force all the good roleplay servers to have to use whitelists to even stand ten minutes without a griefer attack..?
-All dungeons have a set layout. All 'Avian Temples' are the same Avian Temples as the last temple you saw. All 'Apex Labs' have the exact same buildings in varying states of decay. There is no creativity. There is no meaning.
-I seriously don't trust chucklefish. 

TL;DR: Don't get this. It's only gone downhill and Chucklefish is actively making it harder for the people who make the game fun to make the game fun. Just leave this sinking ship alone- it'll die out someday, just like The Stomping Land. It was fun while it lasted. /salutes

  - Decent Graphics
  - Interesting way of harvesting resources ; You no longer need a axe, pickaxe, hammer, ect.
  - QUESTS!! Quests were you can fight bosses, get loot, and get good rewards.
  - Really good soundtrack
  - The pretty much infinite universe
  - THE WAY THE TREES FALL!!!  In most survival games trees fall right on top of you, but not in this game, in this game,       the trees fall realistically!!!
  - Gun and Weapon stats have detail
Cons:
  - No map (even for individual planets) so you have no idea where you have been.
  - The enemies tend too be adorable and huggable (I literally was killed by one with a BOW on its head!) so they don't look like enemies.
  -The start-up menu takes a long time too load.

Most of my in-game hours were spent a whole decade ago (or somewhere near that) when Starbound was in Early Access, 'Koala' experimental or whatever it was called.

With no rose-tinted glasses, I thought Starbound was an amazing game (for an Early Access title!) with a solid future ahead of itself! Gameplay needed a fair amount of polish - as befits an Early Access title - but the rock-solid foundations for an incredible sandbox game was set in stone; I could see myself sinking thousands of hours into Starbound!

...Come the combat update all those years ago (experimental 'Giraffe' build or something), all I could think was ""Oh dear. Oh no."" and on behalf of Starbounds' initial design philosophy, I felt an impending sense of doom at the direction Starbound suddenly shifted towards; from open sandbox to... linear story-based.

I ended up forgetting about Starbound until some time passed since its 1.0 release. Gave Starbound a shot, was total [REDACTED] and, frankly, confusing. 

Starbound was the game where I adopted the mantra of 'Never buy Early Access games'. Thank you for the lesson, Chucklefish!

Years after that, like the carcass of a whale at the bottom of the ocean, is where I found Starbound in my Steam Library. ""Holy *(&# I forgot that I had forgotten about Starbound!"" I thought to myself.

""With tempered expectations, I will give Starbound a try after all these years!""

And so I gave Starbound a whirl, and after a fresh installation... for 5 minutes I'm stuck trying to load the main menu? No problem, I'll just use Task Manager to close out the progr-- Oh! Hello Blue Screen of Death.

I do (another) clean installation... and once I'm in the game?

Oh dear. Oh no.

Entities sometimes freezing/stalling when they take damage? Doors still open and close on the same tick? Logs and crops from harvested trees and plants STILL falling/phasing through 1-3 tile thick floors? Moving platforms suddenly lose collision when they reverse direction, causing character to phase/fall through them? The game stutters as it tries to render 80+ dropped objects?

After all this time and Starbound still is a... buggy mess of a game? You're telling me my rig can run a cheese cannon in Skyrim on ultra settings, but my rig will struggle to run Starbound?

The art direction and music is still a solid 10/10, though. Starbound has a lot of love put into its visual design, animations, and the music... apparently that all comes to the detriment of almost every other aspect of Starbound.

Edit: Came back to this review after a while, this game is basically a sandbox, space adventure game, (I tell people to imagine Minecraft as a space sandbox instead and with more stuff) with a slightly short, but wonderfully told story, (you can still play after the story as well) about life after humans (and 6 other assorted races) manage to learn how to live on other planets and scatter across the universe in search of habitable planets and lands. It's a wonderful game and some say the planet layout gets repetitive, but I disagree with it. About 90% of the time the planet layouts are all unique and beautiful. To top it all off, the soundtrack is so nice and relaxing to enjoy as you play!

You're welcome or this explanation, have a wonderful time exploring and playing! The universe awaits.

Fans of sandbox games appreciate the freedom to explore and create in a virtual world, and Starbound delivers on that front with its vast universe filled with planets to discover, each with its own unique biomes, enemies, and treasures.

One of the game's most significant draws is its sci-fi setting, which sets it apart from other sandbox games like Minecraft and Terraria. The game's art style and soundtrack create a sense of wonder and adventure as players explore the unknown reaches of space. Fans of Starbound appreciate the game's immersive universe, customizable spaceship, and quest system, which provide a sense of purpose and direction for their exploration.

Players can gather resources, craft items, build structures, and engage in combat against various alien creatures, similar to other sandbox games like Terraria. However, Starbound also features two-dimensional side-scrolling action that gives the game a different feel from other sandbox games. Additionally, the game's boss battles provide a challenge for players to overcome as they progress through the game.

Starbound's customizable spaceship is another unique feature that sets it apart from other sandbox games. Players can use their ship to travel between planets and store their resources and items. Fans of sandbox games appreciate the ability to customize the game with mods to tailor the experience to their own preferences and playstyle.

In conclusion, Starbound is a must-play for fans of sandbox games or sci-fi settings. Its unique features, immersive universe, and quest system provide a sense of adventure and exploration that is hard to find in other games. Whether you're looking for a new sandbox game to sink hours into or just want to explore the universe and customize your spaceship, Starbound has something for everyone.",1681614035,1681614035,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The only real way to enjoy it nowadays is with intensive modding. If you're fine with that it can be fun, but at that point I'm not recommending Starbound anymore.

Another aspect that should be noted is the exploitation that got us Starbound in the first place. Passionate people with a love for the game worked (in some cases) hundreds of hours for no compensation except a potential future position which of course never came.

EDIT:

I wrote that when I was in 6th grade. I am now in college.

This game, had so much potential, and it truly shows with how its development went. Using actual child labor, rotating devs in and out, god it was a shitshow.

Back then, I truly did have fun, I really did. But now? God what went wrong.

This game is a shell of its former self. after 1.0, nothing felt the same. Linear armor progression, no actual hostile planets, everything was easier. Dude I thought the story was the best stories ever made, but I see now that it was just rushed. Scan items? Really?

It hurts to give this game a bad review, because this truly used to be my favorite game. But only the modding community keeps it alive, and there hasn't been and update in years. 

It used to be fun.

if you'd like some comparisons to understand it better, i'd say it is similar to terraria, in having numerous items and gadgets to find and use, but also like minecraft in that, while it does have an ""end goal"", comparable to terraria's moon lord, the real draw is the gameplay itself, the weapon types may not strictly be as diverse as terraria, but it's a lot more diverse than minecraft (a lot of weapons are randomly generated, but i am mostly referring to weapon types here), all in all, i'd say that this game is a cross between the two, with aspects of the refining and progression you could expect of terraria, mixed with the endless world exploration and fun hobbies available in minecraft, i hope this explanation helps some of you out there, have fun!",1630717650,1681137495,True,1,0,0.520958065986633301,0,True,False,False

I'll start with that, this game isn't a good pick if you are looking for good AI boss fights and such (get terraria if you are looking for this). But when it comes towards content it's good.

One of these mods should be ""Frackin Universe"".

Think of a space dungeon asteroid adventure survival mining farming cooking building exploring discovering looting shooting pixel sidescroller with very minimalistic core RPG elements where your equipment develops and you level up as yourself playing the game with more skill. All of these with simple game mechanics where the game interface doesn't stand between you and the game world.

This little gem of a game delivers with ease that many other open-world games claim (or even boast) to have but fail to deliver, some of them miserably. For sure, creating an open-world game with an ample of interesting content of many layers like an onion is not an easy task. Well, here you can even drill down to the liquid core of the planet if you wish so. As a matter of fact, in weeks you can remove the outer hard dirt / stone layer of the whole planet, leaving the liquid core only. 

Want to create a space station? Any day. Build a crew of space chicken or feudalist robots? Of course. Digging through rocks made of flesh with a mining mech? Naturally. Assassinate a UFO penguin dictator? Surely.

[b]Starbound[/b] is a game that captures the essence of exploration and adventure, as vast as the cosmos itself! As a Decepticon who has travelled the universe and seen its wonders, I must say that this game has impressed me.

The game's pixel art graphics are reminiscent of the G1 Transformers show, taking me back to the time when I was battling Optimus Prime and the Autobots. The soundtrack is also noteworthy, it takes me to a time when Soundwave was a mere cassette player.

In Starbound, you play as a space explorer who has crash-landed on a mysterious planet. From there, you'll need to gather resources, build a base, and explore the vast universe. The game has an extensive crafting system that allows you to create everything from weapons to spaceships. The ability to travel from one planet to another is as exhilarating as the first time I transformed into my jet form and flew.

The game also has multiplayer mode which allows me to team up with my fellow Decepticons, Ramjet, Thrust, and Skywarp, to explore the universe together.

Overall, Starbound is a game that I would highly recommend to anyone who loves adventure and exploration. I give it a Starscream 8/10. And if you haven't played it yet, do it.",1680629601,1680629601,True,9,2,0.630263209342956543,0,True,False,False

Before you get the game, Starbound hasn’t been updated in a long time so it might lag at some parts. When I got my new computer and put Starbound onto my drive to move it onto there, some things slightly broke. The game still worked, but the screen size was off and the resolution was blurry. While fixable, glitches like this could come on newer computers since the game isn’t updated anymore. I thankfully got my old user fixed, and it’s cool to see how I left my original world. Some other features can be inconsistent, such as not being able to aim your sword while being able to freely aim spears. Even with the game being discontinued for a while, Starbound holds up pretty well and is still super fun. The game by itself feels like a complete package, and it took me 75 hours to beat the final boss!

While Starbound might seem like a survival game, after the first planet Starbound instantly turns into a 2D exploration/quest game. The game isn't easy, but your ship has everything you need and you don't need to find food that often when you can fill up your inventory by purchasing food from stores. Some people might like the easier survival, and after getting highly protective armor and gaining all the unique blocks you're free to build whatever you want without having to find food or worry about losing much. Platforming around unknown planets while avoiding monsters can still be difficult, though!

Starbound's exploration is super enjoyable, and none of the planets feel empty compared to other space games. The first time you play the game is when the exploration is the most overwhelming. You start off the game in your ship, which is broken down, and you have to find a way to repair it. I won’t spoil too much, but the goal is to get enough resources to fly to other planets and explore each race’s village, eventually unlocking the village’s boss. There are 8 bosses in total and each one can be replayed at any time. The first ones, though, are super hard! 

The exploration, like I said, is very well-made with each planet having many secrets. While planets can get same-y without mods, you can still find a giant castle on a desert planet, having to parkour over broken bridges, or a lava-themed dojo where you have to turn into a ball to sneak past enemies. I still remember going to a giant volcanic castle and fighting off a giant 100-eyed miniboss bird. I eventually got it to low enough health, before finally throwing a “capture pod” to lock it inside forever. Just in case, I kept the pod in a highly secured metal locker... it was a nice one, though!

A lot of people advise downloading mods to make the game better, but I think that the first time you play Starbound you should play it without mods. The game is charming enough on its own and the normal story isn’t bad- it just slows things down. Because of this, the story is more of something you should only play through once. Actually, once you finish the game there are still multiple secret quests to discover. After completing the main story, you can adventure to different portal gates and defeat the bosses in them before they close forever. For me it felt really cool going into the short metroidvania-styled levels and defeating the epic randomized bosses, then jumping out before everything inside disappears.


I think Starbound is one of the best space games in terms of space/planet exploration. The game is made on a super big scale, and after you complete it the game definitely “makes an impact.” Even though the game doesn’t fully expand on the survival part after the beginning, and instead tries to become an exploration game near the end, there are still a lot of fun things to find. I might be biased because of how much fun adventures I got from it, I would give this game a 9/10!

I bought this game thinking it was the ultimate 3rd person 2D space game to find that every planet has pretty much the same enemies and dungeons with different looks and levels of difficulty, every specific item you need will take an hour or several just to find/get, and the boss gameplay is pretty predictable after the first 2 or 3 times (sometimes first go) facing them. The last boss made every mission seem worth while but once your back on the ship you get that feeling that this could have been better  as a short film or animation than 54 or so hours wasted away on an experience easily satisfied with Terraria or even Minecraft to be honest. I have no hate towards this game, and I don't want the creators of this game to read this and think ""wow this guy thinks I wasted all my time and sweat over this"" for a 3rd person 2D space game to really be great, it would need to have a huge amount of data with a higher processing power needed than most computers use for games.

                               -------new review 2023, 04/02--------

Its been a few years since I lasted played this game

The strange lag issues where the game freezes for a moment.
Never had this issue with this game before or any other game.

I read some mods cause this issue or its bad code exchanging of information?
I started without mods played well for a few hours but then after I traveled to another system
that is when the freeze issue began and it started crashing to the desktop.

Never had this issue with this game or any other game makes me wonder
cause there is no way my frames should be dropped to almost 10 with a 1070 TI or a 1080 TI
Not even a 1050 TI or any VGA card with over 3 - 4GB of memory on it should have issues.

Drivers are updated, I have netframe up to par.
Everything checks out fine 

16GB on the board. 
Processor with 4GHZ AMD series
(And no I will not disclose my actual brand specs of my PC not here to feed into any A typical stereotype looking to blame the PC for being the main reason Gaming companies and random narcissistic kinds always make it the first thing)

All I can say is through the years I have noticed this game has had its issues on and off which were fine but came to the point where the game has some strange lag coming from somewhere like a memory leak? uhh yeah did a couple of test on my PC everything checks out.

Though I noticed doing a test in the game there is a slight issue where for some odd reason there seems to be some kind of break in coding information giving it is not receiving certain parameters if I may put it that way..

Meaning For some reason it is not getting information feed in correctly So when X is attempting to communicate with M and R there seems to be a broken pattern somewhere.

Missing information what is causing it? I still have my old starbound files from the good old days of 1.20 - 1.40.

None of the current issues show in any of those surprised in 2013 that the game was more stable now than it is now... what has chuckle fish really messed up this time?

For years i wanted to play this but being a PC game only i had to wait to get it.
I love dying, that my favourite part of this game, aside from the beautiful graphics of the game and the depth of potential it holds.
i like getting far into a dungeon/cave system and dying from falling/coconut turnips/snapping hair girls/giant chameleons, i also like dying by a surrounding swarm of bats every few minutes too.
i also like dying because of confusing janky WASD controls. my PC is literally screaming controller support at me.
I totally understand why people love playing video games with a CV and cover letter style game-pad, it makes the experience of gaming so much more real and easy to grasp.
I highly recommend this game if you love getting stressed out/disappointed/frustrated and not progressing in games, but also love pixel art and the attention to detail.

Another thing i thought was really good was the size of the font, and the speed of the dialogue, i have no idea what is happening with the main story because the text is so small and by the time i have made out the first few words it moves on to the next set of dialogue, further more its a nice touch that you can't enlarge the text or have a ""click"" or ""tap to continue"" the dialogue function. 
The inventory menu is very small as well which is pretty cool because i hate looking at my inventory to see what items i have.
Another thing that makes this game great is its abundance of weapons and armour. I got some armour right at the start that i still have now. i haven't found any more yet but i'm sure if i die enough ill find some eventually.

Overall i give this game a 10/10. It lives up to expectations and even though i got it in the sale i would have bought this game for full price. It rightfully deserves the overwhelming positive reviews. A true masterpiece.

Coming back to take a look at what this game is now is truly fascinating. This is just beyond any game i have played before. Something in this really got me motivated to save the universe and all existence. 

This game has an amazing story and i love the art style as well, but what i think is best in the game, the soundtrack. Every music i hear in this game just perfectly fits in it's own scenario. All the boss musics are my favorites, my personal favorite is the ruin's exploration music. Every time when i hear it,  it just reminds me of all the work i had done to get to that peak point of the game. To settle the scores with the ruin that had caused so much havoc and destruction.

After years of maintaining a Negative Review for Starbound due to technicalities here's what I got to provide for the game as a whole. Now with over a thousand hours spent in-game.

Is it worth the cost?
YES - You can easily get plenty of enjoyable time and adventures out of it this title.

Do you need mods to do it?
YES & NO - Frackinuniverse is probably the #1 way to multiply the content and enjoyable bits to it.

Is Multiplayer easily taken advantage of?
Absolutely is, anyone can go into singleplayer and /admin in a bunch of bs and destroy your content if you are not playing whitelist. Feature that was promised in early alpha never made it in requiring server-side files for a character.

Does Chucklefish care about it's community?
-They were banning people asking about promised features very early after their ""Official Release""
-If they like you yes they can be helpful
-They could potentially release a big update destroying the core of the game -AGAIN- but not lately.",1405334970,1679492392,True,0,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

From the moment you're dropped onto an alien planet, the sheer scope of the game is evident, and the sense of discovery never fades.

The pixel art visuals are charming and incredibly detailed, and the soundtrack sets the perfect tone for your journey through the universe. The gameplay itself is a seamless blend of exploration, combat, and crafting, allowing you to build everything from humble huts to sprawling space stations.

What really sets Starbound apart, though, is its boundless sense of creativity. With nearly infinite procedurally generated planets to explore, each with its own unique flora and fauna, there's always something new to discover. The sheer variety of weapons, gear, and items to find and create is staggering, and the game encourages experimentation and exploration in ways few other titles can match.

Despite its depth and complexity, Starbound manages to strike a perfect balance between accessibility and challenge. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or a newcomer to the genre, there's something here for everyone. Overall, Starbound is an absolute masterpiece of a game, and one that every fan of sci-fi and adventure should experience.",1679417777,1679417777,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a very badly put together mess of stories that don't really feel rewarding, and the variety of dungeons/planets is not good. The only really decent part about the base game is the soundtrack and some of the unique uncraftable weapons. (That the craftable Violium Broadsword can outperform)

Alongside all of that, the Beta was way better. It did not have a railroading story, the planets were more diverse, and there was even more types of weapons. The Beta felt more like a fun sandboxy game you can break. You need to download a mod in the current state of the game just to get similar movement capabilities to the Beta.

Speaking of which, this game has some amazing modding potential. There is basically a mod for everything you can think of. I won't list them because you can just take a look at the workshop and see for yourself.

Overall, the base game is a 2/10, with mods it can easily be a 10/10. The only thing saving it is said modding community and Steam's feature to play older versions of the game. I would get it on sale for as cheap as possible.",1639081020,1679200993,False,4,0,0.525351941585540771,0,True,False,False

Then mods will help. Frackin Universe is the biggest and can make you sink much more hours into the game.

It's okay, really. But it's no more than okay.
It could've been much more.
The storyline is you going places and slaying monsters as a chosen one. Not much.
The combat is not as interesting as I wanted it to be. Things can slice, shoot, magic, block and place buffs. And there are a few of unique abilities and ways of dealing damage. Of course, you can describe a really complex system like that, but it's not.
There are little structures. You can see them all maybe not too quickly, but it's not hard.
No underground variety. And all resources can be found on the surface in chests in plenty, as well as upgrade materials and weapons.
Fishing, archaeology, collecting pets, farming - all boring.
There is a bounty-hunting quests and items, but it could've been better.

While the game initially draws you in with its colorful graphics and unique setting, it quickly becomes apparent that there's not much substance to the game.

One of the biggest issues with Stardbound is its lackluster storyline. The main questline is short and uninspiring, offering little incentive to keep playing once it's completed. Additionally, the game's world feels empty and lifeless after about 10 hours of gameplay, leaving players with little reason to explore further.

Another major disappointment with Stardbound is the lack of good mods available. While some mods do exist, they are often buggy or poorly designed, and the game's community is not as active as it could be.

Overall, Stardbound has the potential to be a great game, but it falls short in too many areas to be truly enjoyable. We would like to ask the developer to consider adding new additions or DLC to the game, to help keep the world feeling fresh and engaging for players.

Even by then the missions aren't great, the only way I could find to even beat a boss was by doing some completely unrelated sidequest to get some stupid item that made the boss's quite literally unavoidable homing attack that does worth half of your hp in damage even SLIGHTLY tolerable. Half of the enemy AI is just either actual aimbot or a dumb fast creature with a large hitbox that does 400 damage and instakills you.

Starbound is a rather straightforward and simple game that doesn't particularly have any idea what it wants to be. Although it seems to and was initially a sandbox exploration game, its story mode is definitely a scuffed and forced addition. I'd say that you can enjoy base Starbound and not get bored by the repetition through at least one playthrough.

Though the game may be abandoned by its developers, the community is still going quite strong in both terms of the fanart and modding community. With the supplementation and addition of community made mods, extra depth and polish can be seemlessly added into the game to support vanilla Starbound's mediocre content.

The soundtrack is an absolute godsend though and is one of the most memorable and unique things about the game.

TL:DR - It's like Skyrim, but instead, the parent company doesn't milk it and decided to let it rot and suffer in the dark instead.

It has much the same vibe as Stardew Valley in the sense that there is no absolute requirement to do anything in any particular order, and you are completely free to ignore saving the galaxy in favor of building that cottage with the secret genetics lab underneath on that volcanic island in the middle of an ocean of lava that you've always wanted. The tech tree, types of building materials, and amounts of gear are surprisingly robust, and the planets that can be explored (while predictable once you've seen all of the types) are filled with a multitude of biomes, creatures, and gear to better murderitize (murderatize?) said creatures with.

All in all, the vanilla game can give you MANY hours of fun, and the mods make that fun essentially endless.

There's some decent amount of issues in the way of jankiness, performance and glitches. A planet's blocks are not generated off world. Which heavily limits what is supposed to be an exploration based game to more of a 'find a planet and settle' game. Because if you decide to automate a planet and then go do something somewhere else, everything is put on pause on said automated planet. Your ship's not really an option either as there's various memory leak issues with storing, moving and creating blocks on the ship. Make sure you don't automate too much though because with that, comes inevitable performance issues even on top end PCs, I suspect the game is quite CPU bound which is not uncommon for older variations of these types of games. But I can't say for sure as I've not done the testing.

- Explore an unending, procedural generated universe with dozens of planet types, and even more biomes within them. 
- Capture critters and beasts a-la pokemon, by throwing capture-pods at them once weakened
- Build a ship and recruit a crew, designed as per your own imagination
- Start a farm, build some houses, make a colony and collect income from your rentoids; who may have cool info or jobs for you
- hook up an electrical system that automates all the tedious crafting and smelting for you
- Build and customize your own, space-worthy mech for zero-gravity salvage efforts, or for storming a ship's defenses before boarding
- Get into archaeolgy and dig up bones of extinct alien creatures for display
- Admire the Beautiful pixel art design on both the environment and items, with very expressive lighting and particle effects.
- Explore the random universe and find weird settlements, dungeons, and items - be they a funky hat or a sunkiller laser
- Import your own MIDI files so that you can play the better call saul theme song on ANY instrument in game
- Easily do all of the above with friends, because multiplayer doesnt need your own dedicated, paid server.

This isn't even scratching the surface of what's available with just a little bit of modding, and at 16.99: Canadian it's an absolute steal. Seriously.

It's a fantastic game all on its own.

Edit:

Mods are amazing and the game is still great, though it is important to note that it is built on a foundation of slave labor (Getting free volunteers who want a job and then throwing them away and not crediting them like garbage once they get sick for a week kind of slave labor) and due to this few features mesh together well and simply fail to function, such as how player movement was adjusted so you ran faster and jumped lower but the terrain remained excessively tall and annoying, which worked great with the old yet janky movement but terribly for the new and fluid movement.

In summary, don't do a slavery kids.

Every planet is different, every enemy is unique, every weapon is special! Even just the vanilla game is a treat to play! There's no need to follow the story if you wanna just play and do what you want! Speaking of the story, while it is fairly basic and takes a fair bit of time to complete, it's still an interesting one that includes elements of prophecy, god-like beings, and a sense of scale amongst the science fiction!

The gameplay is simple enough to where anyone and everyone can play, yet complex enough for players to do some really cool and interesting things in combat! You can wield an assault rifle that shoots grenades like the Pulse Rifle of Dead Space 2, or you can dual-wield two machine pistols and play like you're in Last Action Hero!

And don't even get me started on the customization. While it may first seem like there's not much in customization, that's just to start your characters off. You can wear tribalistic attire from the Florans' fashion shops and pretend you live in a native tribe millennia before space travel, or you can dress up like Starfleet with the Apex's clothing and set out to explore the infinite universe!

But wait! There's more!

If your vanilla experience is getting too basic for you, hop onto the Workshop and download some mods! House of Ashes, Frackin' Universe, there's no end to the mods! Tired of using a basic pistol? Grab the Dead Space mod and get yourself a freaking Plasma Cutter! Want a mod with a new race and interesting aesthetic?

The graphics are immensely charming, most of the music is some of the grandest, relaxing, and comforting, orchestration I've heard out of a video game, and the gameplay is fun, familiar, and easy to get used to, albeit somewhat clunky here and there.

And it breaks my heart that the developers have dropped the ball so hard.

There's a major lack of biome diversity for what should be an expansive alien universe, the races in the game feel surprisingly one-note and shallow, the code is horribly optimized, and the story is some of the worst jumble of generic, shoehorned, railroading afterthought I've had to suffer because of how boring it is, as well as for the fact that it actively discourages exploration and allowing the player to figure things out at their own pace. It's okay for a first playthrough, if a bit annoying, but there is no nuance, no attachment to most of the characters, and the gravity of the overarching narrative holds zero emotional impact, making it utterly worthless to bother with more than once.

That said, the modding community is very much active, very much alive, and they are the blood and soul that keeps the abandoned heart of this game beating. There are so many mods that expand features, add new alien races to play as, new biomes and worlds, new mechanics, materials, gameplay styles, and anything else you can think of. These people who volunteer their free time to fix the things left broken and unfinished in Starbound are the biggest reason why I can feel comfortable recommending this game to anyone.",1677258969,1677258969,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Начну с плюсов:
* Красивый арт. Приятно смотреть на игру, приятно создавать свое поселение - с фонтанчиками, скамеечками, лампами. Особенно нравится как реализовано освещение.
* Саундтрек.
* Неплохо сделано оружие, хороший баланс урона-хп. Из этого можно сделать хорошую боевку, но...
* Достаточное разнообразие миров (планет)
* Бои на мехах в космосе хорошие (но тут тоже есть ньюансы)

Минусы:
* Боевка в целом. Да, оружие неплохое, но этого не достаточно. Ведь еще и нужны интересные противники. А с этим тут все очень плохо. Враги в основном просто сближаются с персонажем и дамажут контактно. Некоторые еще стреляют или типо того. А еще когда я исследовал планеты, то уставал от толп одинаковых скучных противников, которых просто закликиваешь мышкой.
Более того, на разных планетах вам встречаются одни и те же спрайты противников, которые делают одно и то же. Тут рандомизация визуала не помогла бы, но помогло бы разнообразие ИИ.
На форумах можно найти советы - строить поселения на безжизненных планетах, так как там не спавнятся ""раздражающие"" (цитирую) мобы.
Боссы следаны чуточку лучше, но тоже довольно скучны.
В итоге, просто закликиваешь мышкой врагов и лечение. Все.
* Боевка на мехах гораздо лучше сделана, там то как раз и встречается некое разнообразие ИИ. Даже есть какая никакая ""тактика"" - предпочтительно сначала выцеливать ""зеленый кораблик"", а потом уже остальных (потому что он очень больно дамажит). Но все равно маловато разнобразия.
* Планеты пустые и бессмысленные. В первые пару раз любопытно, но потом просто пробегаешь их, собирая лут на продажу.
* Куча бессмысленных предметов и расходников. Прошел игру, и ни разу ничто не пригодилось - разве что ""аугменты"" в EPP на спине
* Бессмысленное расширение корабля. Ну ок, первые 2 улучшения имеют смысл - просто что бы всякие крафтильни поставить на корабле, а дальше незачем. Украшать разве что, если вам мало построить поселение.
* Поселения бессмысленные. НПС выдают скучные однотипные квесты по типу ""принеси-подай"" и ""спаси-убей"" с бессмысленными наградами. Те же квесты выдают НПС в сгенерированных поселениях.
* Фермерство тоже неинтересное и бессмысленное. Как и готовка еды.
* Подземелья скучные. Мало разнообрания. Спавнятся всякие структуры не часто.
* Квесты на отлов преступников скучные по большей части. Максимум - это когда чувак скрывается от тебя от одной планеты на другую. Или ищешь код от двери в урне с мусором в паре шагов.
* Сюжет уныл и предсказуем. Еле вытерпел его пройти, эти убогие ""пойди и посканируй мебель"".

Могу посоветовать эту игру разве что любителям пиксельарта, что бы строить арты, поселения. Вот это у игры очень здорово получается. Все остальное - увы нет.",1677243779,1677243779,False,2,0,0.527272701263427734,0,True,False,False

I have grown to enjoy the game a lot more overtime, largely in thanks to mods. Sadly though, everything in my original review still holds true. So the vanilla game is still a do not recommend from me, but the massive modding community makes up for the short comings that originally caused me to leave a negative review.

Original Review:
I enjoyed this game back when my friends and I played it in 2014. But as it is now, I hate it.

-There really needs to be one more difficulty setting, between casual and survival. I don't mind, and in fact enjoy, having the need for food. But I absolutely loathe dropping items on death, especially when that can include key quest items.
-The movement feels extremely slippery. The difference of 0.05 sec on a key-hold can be the difference between taking a small step and throwing yourself off a cliff to your death. This is only worsened by the abundance of deep pits both above and below ground.
-The hotbar feels extremely restrictive in comparison with other similar games. (apparently there is a second page to the hotbar accessed by pressing 'x', but of course the game fails to mention this at any point.)
-The intro feels like it skips explaining a lot. You learn to dig, you learn to fight, but not to craft. No explanation for hunger is given until you are already near starvation.
-And you are almost immediately told to dig to the center of a planet after having just touched down for the first time. Intro quests should aid the player in learning the game before throwing something that ambitious at them. (Edit: This doesn't really apply anymore since they added the Poptop Mother's mine to the starting world.)",1469230952,1677217069,True,0,0,0.479393571615219116,1,True,False,False

Starbound is a sandbox adventure game in the same vein as terraria, however not just in space but also with a full story. The game has a more piano and soft soundtrack compared to terraria and has many different components when it comes to mining, interacting, the works. However this game is still largely a lot of fun to play and mess around with, especially with mods like the saturnians (moth mod) or Frackin' Universe.

The vision was not realized and was either dialed back, lost, or changed somewhere along the way. There are some good systems here, and i'm sure mods fix a ton of the shortcomings, but I just went back to other games instead of spending my time finding a perfect combination of mods. Instead of searching through endless planets, settling on the cool ones, clearing content... you end up picking one to progress your story, playing a bit with all the systems, and having a lackluster single player experience even while playing multiplayer.

There are other games your time will be spent with, and looking at reviews you will see which one I am talking about right away, and they are right.

Me being wary of Chucklefish since this project has proven true. Wargroove was mediocre. Pathway was so bad it's been free repeatedly. Starmancer has barely seen work done on it since I picked it up. I don't actually even buy these games for the most part, they just end up included in Humble Bundle and I give them a go, and am not impressed again. I grabbed Starmancer because the trailer made it look a lot more done than it actually was. Careful with buying Chucklefish stuff.

add as a joke..Ever since “the incident” which had left Shining with the biggest, fattest stallionhood Equestria had to offer and with two hyper-stacked, playful marefriends at his side, life had been very, very different for him, and not just in the regard that none of his clothes fit anymore!
 
Well, to be entirely fair… It had taken a while until some semblance of trust had developed between him and the cunning, stupidly busty changeling queen. He had interrogated her on a daily basis, entering her cell wearing a custom set of clothes devised by his tailor to keep his hulking muscles and massive, flaccid cock in check, then leaving her an hour or so later with his clothes in tatters, torn apart by his monstrous, towering erection, once the relentless, lewd teasing of the changeling queen had been too much even for him!
 
Queen Chrysalis loved to play dirty, and if that meant disguising herself as Princess Celestia, standing tall and proud in the middle of her cell, requesting the guard captain’s assistance with all of the copious, sweet milk dripping from the immense, perfect mammaries which she barely managed to carry with her hands… then so be it. Sometimes she even appeared as Twilight Sparkle, and pulled Shining into a deep, warm hug while staring up at his face with cute, ‘innocent’ puppy eyes. Oh yes, Queen Chrysalis knew exactly how to mess with a stallion, control him… And yet she had slowly warmed up to him, to that big, studly dork of a stallion that was married to her nemesis, the Princess of Love. Even Cadance had lost most of her anger for Chrysalis.
 
It took a while for them to agree on a bargain, but as they finally did, all three of them were happy. Queen Chrysalis was allowed to leave her cell… Under the condition that she would never leave Shining Armor’s side and make no attempts at escape. Additionally, she would have to help them figure out how to reverse the spell to the best of her own abilities.
 
So what did Chrysalis get out of it? All the love she could ever want, or that’s at least what she claimed. She wasn’t lying, but the deeper truth was that her knees went weak at the mere thought of his monstrous, perfect and ungodly virile cock. Whatever that spell had done, it had left Shining as such… such a fucking STUD. Why would she want to take over Equestria if she could live a life essentially as Shining Armor’s second wife? Maybe she had developed just the tiniest bit of a crush on him… All she really wanted, no, what she really NEEDED was right here.
 
And so their new life began, and a truce was announced. Queen Chrysalis became Shining Armor’s and Cadance’s ‘bedbug’, hungrily competing with his wife for his towering stallionhood and his swollen, cum-bloated balls. Often he’d wake up to the sight of Queen Chrysalis’ gigantic, wobbling tits wrapped around his cock, her yard-long tongue making out with his flare as she drained his love, and his bottomless, churning nuts. Unlike any other stallion he was hung enough that not even her cleavage was deep enough to fully smother his dick, and easily strong enough to lift Chrysalis like a doll, manhandle her, pin her down and fuck, fuck and FUCK her, bloating her with bathtub’s worth of jizz until her cum-swollen belly immobilized her, and made even her nearly floor-dragging tits look small.
 
Not like he usually did that. Shining was, after all, huge, awkward and dorky softy who did his best to get used to his new situation and provide for his wife… and now for ‘his’ changeling queen too, apparently.
 
Yes, his life truly was different since this silly magic incident…
 
And yet all of this was merely the beginning. Their tailors still struggled to make clothes that were remotely capable of handling their assets. Even while wearing their dresses, both Cadance’s and Chrysalis’ tits dominated their bodies, completely smothing their laps when sitting! Shining had it even worse. No pair of pants could possibly keep that beastly, huge cock modest. Wherever he went, the eyes of mares were glued to his swaying, musky bulge. Wherever he went, mares ‘accidentally’ bumped into it or grabbed it, or tried to tease him by provocatively bending over when he was around, and giving him a deep, deep view of their butts or cleavages.
 
As if that wasn’t bad enough, that one morning he’d stood up to greet the new recruits of his crystal guard, and well… This usually almost entirely male squadron of stallions happened to consist entirely of pretty, busty mares that one morning. Staring at him with half-lidded eyes, as if they struggled not to jump him right here and now. They’d no doubt known that this was a perfect way to get closer to the biggest, studliest prince Equestria had ever known, and were just waiting for their chance to get a piece…

I decided I would make a full review of Starbound because I am so incredibly sick of my friends summarizing Starbound as just worse Terraria. If you are one of these people, [b]this is the truth about Starbound, good and bad.[/b]

You will often see people compare this game to Terraria and concept wise, Starbound is the winner. It is basically if Terraria had a never ending universe that you can traverse with thousands of diverse planets with their own creatures, gravitational pulls, weather patterns, cores, bosses, and cities.

[h1]But, Starbound is more complicated than that.[/h1]

[b]Starbound is abandoned by their developers.[/b] The company that made the game, Chucklefish, stopped updating the game because they had some controversy regarding exploiting some of their unpaid workers. I am not thoroughly educated on what exactly happened, but as soon as those accusations came out Chucklefish wouldn't touch this game with a ten foot pole. 

[b]The game is incomplete.[/b] They were going to add more depth to the game and were updating it regularly before this controversy. [b]The main story line is EXTREMELY repetitive.[/b] You go to a town on a specific planet, scan the terrain in search of information regarding the race in the town you are visiting. Then you go and fight a boss and rinse and repeat about ten times. For some reason one of the races don't even get a boss or a part in the story, those are the Novakid. There is simply not enough to do in the base game. There aren't enough bosses, the weapons are boring, quests in the game are often just crafting an item or helping an NPC make it through a dangerous area. [b]None of these things got the chance to be fully fleshed out before the game was abandoned.[/b]

[h1]Why is this a positive review then?[/h1]

[b]When Chucklefish abandoned us, the community took matters into their own hands.[/b]
[i]Introducing FrackinUniverse[/i], a collection of [i]hundreds[/i] of mods compiled into one download. I am not kidding when I say playing Starbound with and without this mod is like night and day. New bosses, new races, new structures to discover, new quests, new mobs, new planet types, new crafting menu, new crafting tables, new weapons, new crops, new building materials, new furniture, new ships, ETC are all added to the game using that mod. [b]They are even slowly rewriting the entirety of the story line. It is compatible with the majority of other mods on steam and they have consistently updated it since the ability to mod the game was added.[/b] There's even new systems added entirely, such as beekeeping and collecting fossils. 

[b]The modding community for Starbound is extremely dedicated and hardworking, keeping this game alive for many years now.[/b] They are the real reason that I and many others love this game so much. [b]Starbound with mods is extremely entertaining with endless content because of its cult-like modding community. It was my favorite game for a long time.[/b]

Update: after finishing the game I hate it even more now. 
-The story is garbage with the important characters being one note and barely getting any screen time.
-The ending is so unsatisfying and shallow that I sat through the credits expecting some kind of fakeout only to realize the game didn't end with a bang but the wet soggy impact of a stuffed animal drenched in milk being thrown against a wall
-The beginning of the game is overly difficult then after 30 minutes in you're completely overpowered, the only enemies that will ever pose a threat to you are the ones in the tutorial and the ones in the post game dungeons
-The post game doesn't exist, just a few dungeons to grind for supplies for base building.....which assuming you beat the game, you already made a base
-The combat is repetitive and consists of spamming bandages and using swords/spears because the other melee weapons are awful and the ranged DPS is normally too low to justify using guns
-The hunger system would be perfectly fine, except food doesn't stack and goes bad quickly so it becomes a nuisance 
-The ship requiring fuel does nothing but pad your time for the game
-The game barely supports multiplayer and many bounty missions will break with multiple people
-The game has no built-in mod menu so in order to turn off certain mods you have to manually unsubscribe from them, this makes multiplayer significantly more difficult to set up because the game completely breaks if everyone doesn't have the EXACT same mod list
-The UI is cryptic at best and straight up fights you at worst
-Have I mentioned how overpowered bandages are? Seriously you can heal through every boss with ease, every slow healing item is completely useless in comparison to bandages
-Member recruiting is tedious and takes forever
-The mobility options are hidden behind an optional mission and are vital to get to avoid some boss attack patterns
-There's only one boss who will pose any kind of challenge and that's only if you don't have the double jump, the other mobility options are optional",1587960014,1676609859,False,1,2,0.460465103387832642,0,True,False,False

Regardless of what was in all honesty some childish behavior from myself it doesn't excuse their behavior. 

In addition the moderators protecting the toxic behavior of these trolls is the deathknell of this games community.

If you like terraria but want a more open world exploration aspect then this game is for you. It doesnt have the fancy boss driven progression like terraria but rather an exploration driven progression. This doesnt get repetitive imo as you have a plethora of things to do while exploring to the point where this game can be played for hours in various styles, whether that is becoming the strongest hero in space, or just a farmer on the first planet you spawn on.

There is also a great amount of customisation you can do with both the characters race, armour, vanity and backpack slots to really design your characters appearance. On top of this there is the ability to dye your armour.

The music, art style, light rays, different weathers, and so forth really make this game immersive. You can even find musical instruments and play set songs from them such as clare de lune (which when sat by a campfire in a cave while it rains hits different).

There are also different ""classes"" you can play which is determined by the armour you choose to equip at the time, and you can even capture pets to fight for you in a pokemon style way.

There is also mechs you can create, space stations to trade with, friendly and enemy ships to board to fight while in space. 

MODS: The base game is good for about 40hours of play. However with mods you can easily achieve 300+ hours and thats conservative (Frackin universe is a really good mod)

Bad Bits:

Ive played this game across three platforms of pc gaming, IMac, laptop and now a higher end gaming pc. For me, the optimisation and bugs were found with the lower power systems (like my old laptop). 

Once youve done the story once, there isnt much reason to do it again. It is fun and really engaging however it is quite linear. But, it isnt necessary to do. You can just ignore it and do whatever you want. Progression isnt locked behind the story.

The base game planets have dungeons and a variety of generated enemies and weapons with each planet having a danger rating. However, while there are plenty of dungeons, once youve played the base game for 40hours youve pretty much covered the surface content youre going to see. 

Long story short: The game is what you make of it. It is only limited by what content you want to do. If you play the game for 12 hours, complete the story and thats it then youre missing the point of starbound. Take the time to utilise all the content added and it is some of the most fun you can have. The mods arent necessary but they really enhance the experience making the game and never ending universe feel alive.",1676033103,1676033103,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You feel like some han solo type guy jumping from different systems and doing quests. but it doesnt take long for you to realize everything is put together in a real lazy way.

The worlds are all randomly generated but theres no difference between one ocean world and the next so ie theres really no difference between one solar system and the next. Everything just feels redundent. And don't get me started on the story, you have to use your special tool to find clues about different races so you can get the special artifact. Fun right? Nope, cause you have to do this exact thing for at 6 different races. Over and over and over again. Not to mention the clues are hard as hell to find. I spent 2 hours trying to find clues for the second race. And was only a third of the way done. Plus the combat just feels lazy, either its way to hard or its way to easy.

Like games with it's 2D appeal and not ""over done"" graphics, Starbound is one of my favoured games.. to mod that is.
The normal game is fine.. Just it is a bit repetitive like the same old story-line which you can easily ignore from all the side quests you would get on your journey although you would eventually have to finish the main storyline, lame.

Apart from that the game is a blast! 
If you love exploring, looting, Player vs player, multiplayer, dungeon exploration, building, or just want a game to chill out for the time being this is also on the list.

Modding can make things more enjoyable but honestly they only make the game suck slightly less. The game is definitely playable, but is in need of updates that aren’t coming (yes, I know it’s in a “feature freeze” until the Xbox One port comes out, but let’s be real, that isn’t happening either.).

Chucklefish also has shitty management. There are some pretty “interesting” IRC chat logs out there if you go looking for them (most of the development was done virtually, but the lead ideas guy tried to get a bunch of young devs to move into a house with him in London and pay him rent), plus some other unethical stuff (unpaid child labor!! Yippee!!!!).

You may have fun playing this game, and you may end up getting into modding it like I did years ago (it’s fairly easy to mod, I’ll give it that.). If none of the things I just mentioned really bother you, then it’s only $15. But honestly, your money’s probably better spent elsewhere, like on a burger and a coffee. In hindsight, I wish I had bought those instead.

 Whist the trip of the adventure is fun, you achieve nothing. The main quest is extremely boring and the bosses suck too. There is no mining in the game, no fun caves, no underground biomes, nothing. There are ""infinite amount"" of stars and planets however nothing about them is unique. Same villages, same dungeons, same npcs and same npc missions.
You do not have to work for a single thing in the game, everything is free and you find it while walking around the same planets in different colors, while youre doing the same quest 8 times. 
Nothing feels finished and this game is just overall so lackluster. Post ending the story, the game offers you absolutely nothing, no replay ability.

The story is so absurdly boring that the game would be better off without it, or a mode that ignores it entirely.

Firstly the main story line is just garbage, you go around 'scanning' things around multiple systems and that somehow shows the locations of a challenge map where you conquer its boss. This is done over and over again until the last, much more interesting boss. Seems like a way to force players to see the vast arrays of planets.

Secondly, the combat system. Its just, horrible. Its based on an energy system and it is just so sluggish. It makes the very interesting bosses just garbage. Just like the combat system, almost every system and feature in this game is just so shallow. Fishing, Mechs, and catching monsters and so much more. And most importantly, the selling point of the game, the space and ship system.

This game could be... so much more, would be one of the best games out there, but after a bunch of bad decisions, we get Star bound. Don't get me wrong, I have played this game twice and am playing a third modded time, this is a decent game. But it is a very shallow one. What also sours the experience is knowing that this game involved unpaid child labour to some extent. What you could do to better your experience ten-fold would be to install Frackin' Universe, a very fleshed out mod. It almost makes you think that the creators of FU put more time, love, and effort into the mod, than the devs did for Starbound. Frackin' Universe expands upon all the shallow features (unfortunately not the combat system) and involves a much better progression system.

With a loving and loyal dev team (*cough cough* terraria), this could have been one of the best games of all time.

The Good.

1. Two dimensional gameplay with low resolution pixel art that exercises combined cursor and keyboard movements for planet hopping interactions, with visually pleasing menus for keyboard keybinding customization, that end up with shifting WASD to ESDF because of that usability F indentation.

2. There is lots of written lore among each planetary settlements, as players try to collect enough fuel for further travels to make hospitable civilization for in-game characters.

3. Gameplay, last remembered, is a smooth process to play on a desktop Personal Computer.

4. The art style is charming and adds to discovery and exploration, with multitudes of planets to build houses and farms for questing support.

5. There is a main storyline quest to keep players engaged throughout their discoveries within the Starbound universe.

The Bad:

1. It is not Terraria. There are no encountered epic boss fights with repetitive run and dash gameplay that shows with the same boss fights that clip through built terrain. The boss fights that do exist, seem relatively easier in difficulty, even with an imposed Xbox controller on the left hand and a trackball peripheral on the right hand with the associative button mapping. 

2. It is not Terraria, in the sense that Terraria allows for simultaneous usage of a Xbox controller and a cursor with built-in menu options without additional third party software installed, a Xbox controller easily can be mapped with the in-game menus for movement and jumping controlls while a cursor device with multiple buttons, more than the typical Microsoft Surface Mouse or Apple Mighty Mouse device, to map useful quick reaction menus and item scrolling functions. It is not intuitive to remember to use Shift + Tab to use some controller overlay that does not work with some Steam updates.

3. It is Starbound. Menu User Interaction designers should try to consider Xbox controllers for movement. But those Steam Deck devices never have good cursory approaches, compared to Surface Pro gaming. Starbound lacks in-game menus or mod listings to know which applet to overlay inside Starbound to have customized controls that User Experience designers try to present pretty menus for keyboard remappings, but not account for things outside of laptop keyboards.

4. There is a very specific nuiance problem with Starbound, evident with walking and platforming with simultaneous usage of some Xbox controller for movement and a cursor trackball movement for precision block placement. Due to the polling rate of wireless bluetooth periipherals, not seen with Terraria because of the designed gameplay of known building paces with a player's movement, it is not known when a player all of a sudden does not place building blocks while walking at a pace. That leads to tip tap motions, and that is not very good User Experience intuition.

5. The main quest line is very very short, after players focus on obtaining the best armor and weapons before continuing through each mainline quest. It is not particularly a bad thing for many players without lots of time and Starbound allows for players to not obsess about mining and digging, unlike Terraria.

6. Non-Playable-Characters that accompany a player on a planet can be very dumb. Such is regarding about avoiding bad terrain, and do block the way of furniture. There is not any way to truce with settlements found if a player Matter Manipulates to destroy furnishings.

7. Very linear main story questing that falls into the bottleneck McGuffin progression. That is on top of disrupting the immersion of what seems to be an open-world building video game that is actually very linear if players then see that Enviro Protection Pack is just another linear unlock to progress to titanium and durasteel tiers.

8. There have been several times Starbound in single player crashed on a Surface Pro device, that no other Steam Personal Computer video game has demonstrated crashes, such as single player Minecraft, Terraria, Borderlands, and Factorio. Crashes usually occur during boss fights with many rendered assets on screen, and significant slowdown occurs with many Non-Playable-Characters at a settlement.

The Simulation Of Long Distance Dating:

1. Starbound happens to build up civilizations with some player acting as some automated robot process, despite multiple organic races to select from, that builds up towns on other planets. Starbound does not simulate what economies occur on a massive planetary scale. There is some space station cargo trading that does go on within Starbound, but finding space stations to greatly increase a player's currency is alot slower with such method compared to fighting off hostile ships upon jumping to a solar system.

2. Even if Starbound does simulate economies for those strange fruits grown in gardens, some looking like fruits for robots for some strange reason, meta interactions would have human players just Skype, Discord, Whatsapp, or any other fragmented mod apps on the side of their Windows Personal Computer or Steam Desk, and that in itself is a clunky multiple device experience with webcams only looking at side profiles of human heads.

3. Multitasking Deep Space Waifu does not make a good phone game experience, on a meta call level if Starbound has such snarky features. Those Non-Playable Character quests about secret notes seem to be very much recycled plays for the player to get weapons and armor to obtain and sell, since mining for ores does not get the best playable weapons suited for a player's reaction timing.

4. Shortswords, spears, and axes are worthless, especially regarding boss fights. Players would quickly render such items as vendor trash. Wands and staves have significant delays for their abilities, that tries to bring in wizardry range and uniqueness with multiplayer gatherings, that is useless for single player.

Such a not recommend thing would shift back to a recommend, if stagnant developers do implement the same customization Xbox controller options and simultaneous cursor button mapping usages with a trackball that can use eight buttons, as Minecraft Bedrock, Terraria, and Borderlands. That is because Steam's controller overlay function fails to operate. It is difficult to advertise Starbound of fifteen dollars needs a twenty-five dollar purchase of reWASD that brings such video game one-time cost back up to the Nintendo price tag of forty dollars with Nintendo 3DS titles and some Nintendo Switch titles. Emulation video games also fall into such categories.b",1670777414,1674879444,False,1,1,0.488286048173904419,0,True,False,False

I once loved Starbound. Honestly. I remember playing it with my friends - we would meet in one of our spaceships to play Zelda songs in our recently found instruments and to show off our new skills, and then we would descent into unknown planets to look out for NPC villages... Man, those were the days. This game was [b]REALLY[/b] good in the past, giving players freedom to advance on their own or settle down as they wish.

But then the story nation attacked. And now most core aspects of the game are hard-locked behind a boring and dull story progression which will make most casual players give up.

Starbound went through several game advancement changes during its development, but it was never so linear as it turned out to be in the [b]Cheerful Giraffe[/b] version back in 2016. It should have been named the Lethiferous Giraffe instead, considering that on that very release this unholy forbidden story arc was added. Starbound has currently [b]ZERO[/b] replayability - you'll unlock skills in the same order, craft stuff in the same order, visit the same planets, do the same quests, have the same adventure over and over, over and over and over and over and over and over...

Most beta players complained about the released changes. And then immediately the game was officially launched. Stonks af.

[i]I wonder what goes wrong with development for all those 2D space-themed games. Jesus, look at Edge of Space. Ew.[/i]

If you want the ""good"" Starbound, give its older versions a try. Also bring some friends. It'll suck less. [spoiler]Or just go play Terraria instead.[/spoiler]

It is a game of tons of variety. You can play as many different races of characters, explore the galaxy, mine for resources, make a colony, capture 100 different insects, get trophies of every enemy, capture the animals in pokeballs, fly around in a mech suit fighting sentient rocks, fire a rocket launcher at a giant piece of poop, fight actual bosses, go fishing, cook the nearly 200 recipes, become a bounty hunter, terraform planets, swim under water to find futuristic japan in order to scan an arcade machine and much more!

I love the variety in activities, I love the music, the artstyle, the ridiculous weapons, the funny dialogue. For the first couple years I had it I loved it. I enjoyed venturing throughout the universe in search of collectibles to decorate my ship and base, and to have the most impressive lockers I can.

But as soon as I revisit the game, much older as I am, the whole thing collapses.

The galaxy awaits you! Do whatever you like! in a completely preset order. For a galactic spanning open world sandbox, the game is extremely linear and restrictive in how you progress, you have to get one tier of equipment and then the next and then the next, no sequence breaks. The story missions have to be done in a specific order, making the linearity even more noticeable, and to add insult to injury, story progress is shared over all saves, so you cannot truly replay the story. The lack of replayability is absolutely catastrophic for the quality.

The wide variety of features earlier comes at a cost, none of them are fleshed out, many are superfluous, some hurt game balance, and even worse many are clunky or poorly executed. Fishing for example, is completely pointless, no rewards for any of it, it can't be used for unique recipes, traded for cash, you can't even place them in an aquarium or something. It is superfluous. Mechs are awesome, they allow you to traverse space and find all new stuff, as well as interact with other ships. However they completely derail the mining, as it gives more ore in larger quantity then you can get while mining, while also being less engaging. The animals that you capture have no real utility, so they are strictly for fun. This makes so much of the game feel directionless and without purpose.

The core mechanics are not really deep, especially compared to contemporaries like terraria, the core movement doesn't jive well with the terrain generator, the hotbar is really tiny, the enemy designs don't get all that complex, there is something resembling classes in the endgame but it makes no real impact, and the building is intuitive, but lacks depth, the furniture is sparse and inflexible, there isn't many ways to modify block shapes, the paint is terrible, the wiring doesn't lead to many interesting contraptions.

A feeling of repetition can easily wash over anyone who explores the galaxy for very long, as each species has only 1-4 structures dedicated to them, and each planet type reuses the same structures and sub biomes. There are also tons of unique, hand crafted enemies, who manage to spread themselves throughout the galaxy. The missions too are procedurally generated, so you better believe the same npc might give you an IDENTICAL quest two times in a row, with the same objective at the same exact place. This wrecks the game's staying power in my catalogue, because I will never see anything truly new again, and I won't gain anything from repeating it I haven't already gained.

On top of all that, the performance of the game is very poor, with it struggling to maintain 30 fps on good machines during the missions, and crashes are way to common for how simple the processes occurring on screen are.

tl;dr, the game was initially enjoyable, and there is a ton of variety, but it suffers from unpolished core gameplay, shallow mechanics, poor replay value, inadequate rewards, repetition, and a slew of technical issues.",1503981935,1673842567,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One positive: the wonderful avian race (which I'll always play as), as well as modded races like the adorable avali.

It has the same rhythm to it when you go out adventuring but you have a ~mostly~ open world. It doesn't feel limiting in any way except that the types of planets that you can set out on are based on how much you level up your crafting stations based on resources found exclusively on certain planet biomes and the story (Think of iron being on one planet but tungsten on another and that gives you stronger armor). 

 However early on there is a good set to explore as every world you start out on is unique. I've played a few playthroughs (5 at least) that were cut short every time and every beginning I ever had there were slight variations to the trees or the types of blocks or NPCs  (if you find any) to make everything different on the starting level. It was enjoyable and while  mining, if you dig deep enough, there is variety in the blocks also. I've encountered even weird blocks such as flesh like ones deep underground in the starting level. Obviously it's e 10+ but still. You can find this level of variety in every single planet even with the same biome type of atmosphere. 

Some of the drawbacks would have to be that you if you ever use a laptop, for the love of your sanity,  USE A MOUSE. Do not throw your poor laptop out of the window out of frustration. I've used a an older potato laptop Win 10 with around 1.5 GB RAM with a trackpad before to play this game and on some tries it was between laggy and smooth. Playable, but the trackpad was awful. Would not recommend. With a mouse you have faster response time.  If you use linux though, this game runs natively on that particular OS without the need of HAVING to run Wine. I  haven't even checked proton settings when playing on it with linux booted up but it runs clean as a whistle. 

The only people I would not recommend this to is if you are looking for a hardcore dungeon crawler experience. The only setback is your armor and how you play. It's a maybe, but if you REALLY crave something in terms of in depth world building or difficulty in something like Morrowind or Dark Souls out of a game then this likely isn't for you either.  That's not a negative on the game's part, it's just how the experience is. Starbound is a fun experience you  can have while sipping tea and then being at the edge of your seat when a certain ""creature"" instadeaths you while you are mining in space.",1673417347,1673417347,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've always wanted to fuck a hylotl. Ever since I got the beta, i've found the idea of sex with a hylotl girl very appealing. Since they're fish, I won't have to worry about lube at all. I can just stick my cock right in, giving her immense pleasure from my massive human 7-incher. Another benefit is that due to humans and hylotl evolving on completely different planets, my sperm would probably be completely incompatible with her reproductive system, so i can cum in her as much as i want, with no fear of accidentally creating some kind of mutant human/hylotl hybrid. Ever since i got starbound from steam, I've been absolutely obsessed with thoughts of hylotl women. These thoughts have replaced my normal fap material for quite some time now, with me usually just heading to my computer, turning on starbound, (with the sexbound API and aphrodite's bow installed, of course) and coming back to the usual hylotl city and fucking every female in sight, which causes me to nut in around 5-10 minutes. I've used every loverslab mod for the game and seen every rule 34 post, yet I can't fill the void in my heart that is fucking the absolute shit out of a hylotl girl. No matter how hard i try to get the closest thing to the experience, I just can't fill the void. So far, I've covered a blue fleshlight in slime from the halibut my dad caught this summer, which worked but couldn't heal the pure pain in my testicles that is being unable to fuck a hylotl girl. I'll do anything for this experience, ANYTHING. I'll get into fucking genetic engineering if i have to. I don't care how far humanity is from creating anything resembling a hylotl, i just want one taste, ONE TASTE, of a beautiful hylotl woman's vagina.

[b] The Aspect Of The Game [/b]
You are one of the last protectorates that are still around from the unfortunate event's that take place in the prologue. Starbound is game where you play your way and do whatever your heart desires. Be it you play alone or with friends you will spend at least 100+ hours in this game. The campaign is optional where you can enjoy the game without ever even progressing past the first objective. There is also a never ending online community where you will eventually find a server with a common interest.

[b] The Value Of The Game [/b]
This is one of my top 10 most played games. In my opinion it is worth every penny to embark on this adventure.

If you enjoy linear story games with lots of exploration and side-quests, this is the right game for you. While most find issues with the fact that this game has little replay-ability, (Not really a problem in my eyes, but is a very big flaw for most.) it's main story is so much fun to go through, (Ignore the fact that most of it is just the same thing with a new puzzle and boss at the end, it hurts me o think of the lost potential.) and a fantastic ending. I love progressing through this game on a new planet every time, flying my spaceship to the nearest moon when I need more fuel, mining in deep caves, finding challenge doors, dying in challenge doors, starting a colony, murdering innocents, and just the peaceful act of sitting outside my brand new house, tending to my farm for food. This game means everything to me, and I hope you find yourself journeying the stars too. (Even if you don't end up enjoying the game, give the soundtrack a listen, you'll love it i promise!)

I found myself losing track of time quite often while playing. However, the game suffers a complete lack of replayability. The game hinges on it's vast and unique ecosystems, locations, quests, stories and lore. However, after the first play through, the game doesn't have much more to offer. Everything I mentioned before becomes boring, and before long, you will find yourself at a lack of things to do. And this is further impacted by the shared universe feature. As you go through the story, permanent changes will occur to your hubworld and npc's will appear. At first, this adds atmosphere to the game, and new vendors and dialogue. But, if you play through again, even at the start, the same people will be there, acting as if nothing changed. The peacekeeper expansion was a breath of fresh air, but it suffers from the same issues after a while. The game suffers from a major lack of replayability, but I will never forget the those feelings of wonder and awe as I explored new planets and learned about an amazingly crafted universe.

Overall: I love Starbound! It's a huge source of nostalgia for me. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi, open world, or sandbox. 

PROS:
- Amazing music
- Unique worldbuilding
- Lots of cosmetics and races
- Dungeons are fun and have little secrets
- Lots of weapon types
- Can have your own ship crew and planet colony
- Collectibles!
- Good replayability
- Lots of cool mods*


CONS:
- The devs abandoned it and a lot more could have been done
- Cheat codes ruined me
- Boss difficulty is weird, first is hard and the last is easy
- Can't beam up underground in Survival. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Starbound is a game with so much potential, and its such a shame that people were overworked on it.
In the vanilla game, after playing a little it gets really boring and, at least in my opinion, building becomes the only fun part.
On that, this games potential for building structures in incredible. There are so many objects and blocks to build almost whatever you want, and the mods only enhance that.
With the actual gameplay, however, it gets boring fast. You go to a planet, get the resource, build better armor and weapons, go to the next planet until you realize you spend 2 hours getting the best stuff and trivializing most of the missions.

It has some very nifty takes on the genre, generating a galaxy with quadrillions of planets to visit, each with a host of biomes and aliens before No Man's Sky was a thing. Plus, you can play as a space furry, that's always a plus in my book.

Unfortunately, this game is slow, in a lot of senses. It's slow in the sense that the main story is padded out in a way that's unfriendly to the player, it's slow in that most of the secondary tasks and achievements are even more of a grind than the main story, and slow in the sense that it's poorly optimized. The optimization is probably the easiest to explain - the whole game runs on the CPU, and only on one core, and in addition to that there's a memory leak you can regularly encounter in gameplay that makes things grind to a halt.

I would recommend not going for the achievements if you choose to play this game, as well as getting a decent amount of mods to make things as efficient as they feel they should be. You can get mods to make crafting instant, or to remove the screen transitions that quickly add up as you beam from place to place with your ship's teleporter, or even skip the entire storyline that feels tacked on and adds little to the gameplay aside from a few really cool pre-made dungeons, but nothing can be done to fix the slowdowns caused by the poor optimization.

There's one more thing that people may want to consider before buying this game. Around 2019 word got out that a dozen voluntary contributors were exploited during Starbound's development, logging hundreds of hours with no compensation, many of them in their teenage years. A bunch of people who used to work with Chucklefish came out to confirm this happened, and it falls at the hands of company director Finn Brice, who also harassed nearly everyone else working there. I know it doesn't matter to everyone, but when looking at the worlds of this game, it pains me to think that people went through hell to get this game together and they weren't even given what they deserved in the end.",1671825616,1671825616,False,227,6,0.831162452697753906,0,True,False,False

- Great pixel art

- The story is kinda bad, you only scan things from start to finish
- You have to join a server or create a dedicated server for multiplayer because you need a really fast internet speed if you want to play multiplayer using steam. This is a problem for me because i'm using mobile hotspot for internet connection
- The game will never be updated again, especially after the Chucklefish controversy

211820,59609028,76561198442934454,0,12,14893,0,11420,1638526837,"For the first hundred hours or so of playing this game I did enjoy it. But as my playtime dragged on and on I begun to notice the cracks to the point I do not particularly enjoy this game anymore, so I want to take a moment to break down what starbound does well, and where it falls flat compared to other games in its genre.

On the positive, starbound has great artistic direction. The visuals, sound effects and music is great, and I think it frankly is what kept me going through the game. Additionally the world of starbound, its races and technology is great and really creative.
However were this game begins to fall flat is its gameplay, I am going to cover this point by point as theres a fair bit to get through.
1) In starbound, the boss fights and the story is progressed through story missions. In order to unlock the next story mission, you must travel to planets in order to find evidence of specific alien races and then scan enough objects to unlock the mission, issue is, this process of scanning is really, really boring. When you decide you want to attempt the scanning, it consists of you going from planet to planet of the correct type, wondering across the entire planet looking for any signs of the race, then running through the civilisation mindlessly looking for green objects only to realise you didn't get all the stuff you need so you now need to go find another planet so on and so on. This gets tedious quickly, especially so on repeat runs, it really bogs the games pacing and I do wish it was not a mechanic.
2) Enemy design. Starbound attempts to make each planet feel different by randomising its enemies a bit. But in reality the enemies are really bland, they are the same 5-10 enemies copy and pasted across every world on the game, the only difference being minor sprite differences. And the enemies themselves are not interesting, they range from enemies that run into you fast, enemies that run into you slow. Enemies with a single range attack, or ones that suicide or cloak. They are not fun to fight, it makes every planet feel the same and it feels really bad for progression. 
3) Progression. After 20 hours of grinding the best gear, you are no better at killing the enemies around you which behave and look identical to the ones you were killing on the starting planet. You never get that sense of strength like you do in games like Terraria unless you backtrack to earlier areas in the game which has no benefit and is just a waste of fuel. Your end game gear isnt more flashy then the beginning gear, at the end of a playthrough, my best weapon, the one that took me all this time to get, was a generic looking gun that shoots bullets, the exact same generic guns that I was finding at the beginning of the playthrough just with a better damage stat. Between this and having no reference for the enemies you are fighting (as they all look the same) you never get that sense of progression that you are in fact getting stronger, the longer you play the more you notice this and the worse it becomes.
4) Bosses and combat. Combat is lackluster, it mostly consists or running into some enemies, hitting them a few times, runnign a way, popping a heal, then running back and hitting a few more times. If you are ranged, this is the exact same but from a distance, theres no skill or excitement. The only time combat gets remotely interesting is the bosses. I am now going to talk about the bosses which is minor spoilers, got to point 5) to avoid them. The boss quality varies wildly. The tutorial boss, the crystal is really solid for a tutorial boss. It has simple attacks, but it has you moving around alot, and at this point in the game you have to be quite resourceful as the enemies in this mission are really strong at this level of progression. Its a fun boss, no complaints. The ixodoom is.... underwhleming. It is very easy and you can beat it by just running left and right until its vunerable and then just attacking it for a few seocnds then it continues. It is not an interesting boss, all the attacks feel weak, the music isnt there and its just dissapointing. Even with the bosses that are more difficult, they still have the tendency to not feel very strong, have meh music and have uninteresting fight mechanics. The only late game bosses I think dont go y this, is the ape and the heart of ruin. The Ape is the only other boss other than the crystal that I would say is a solid boss. It isnt amazing dont get me wrong, but has interesting enough moves and is difficult enough that I dont mind the fight. The heart of ruin solves my weak feeling attack problem, which huge laser beams and tentacles everywhere. The issue lays in two things. A) It is a huuuge bullet sponge and B) Its 90% just a spawner boss. Overall the bosses are just underwhelming and not interesting to fight. (This goes for bosses I havent mentioned too like the dreadwing).

5) Endgame content. The primary engame content are the vaults. The vaults are a cool concept, have good loot and, the vault bosses... are not bad at all. Despite point 4) I think the vault mini bosses are pretty solid as they dont need to be incredivle as they minibosses, they have enough variety of moves and you are moving around dodgin enough that they arent boring to fight. My issue is with the rest of the vaults, they are just room after room of the same boring enemies like mentioned before, and they are just so long. Vaults are not 5 minute in and outs, they take a while to complete, are fairly tedious in their rooms, and to get the best gear you often have to grind quite a lot of vaults.

CONCLUSION:
While I have more points, I believe I have said enough to explain my growing disconnect with this game. Starbound is a game with great visual style, and a great world but suffers from a lack of substance behind its primary gameplay loop, with unrewarding combat, tedious missions and gathering, repetitiveness and underwhelming boss encounters. Despite playing almost 250 hours of this game I can not recommend its purchase.

Cons
- Technially ""abandoned"" since 2018 because the game story and mechanic already finished. (The devs did not say it is abandoned, but they are trying to find someone who continues it, so yes pretty much abandoned)
- Not many mechainc are teached in tutorial or quests. Many you have to figured it out by - yourself or you can just read the whole dialog. They highlight the most important part.
- After you get to know the story mechanic. It is pretty much boring. after you play for a while. [spoiler](Scan objects to fight bosses in a loop)[/spoiler]
- Only mods make the game feel refresh again.

-Exploration is the main enjoyment of the game but the problem is that you are not really given much incentive to explore to these planets. The terrain is consistently inconsistent with most planets being this jagged mess of mountains and caverns with only a few flat areas and these proportions are completely random so you cant scout out a specific planet with a neat terrain. Finding chests and loot are common and rewarding but the challenge of having to scale a fuck ton of hills with enemies knocking you down and dying to fall damage made it feel unrewarding and more of a chore than fun. 

+Cave exploration I have to put in it's category with them doing well with it, mining is fast and exploration is fast, the amount of connecting caverns and large chasms it easier to get materials along with adding a sense of most likely unintended challenge of making sure to map out the caves with lights or else you get lost or end up falling down and dying.

=Combat, is a thing

=Enemies also are also just very basic with only a few unique ones that end up being really easy to kill and end up being forgotten along with the randomized enemies with their basic attack patterns.

=Bosses are a chore to beat with most being bullet sponges with a few special attacks that cycle repeatedly, these bosses end up being farely simple and predictable until it uses its one specific bullshit attack, but atleast its the part of the game where you are not told to walk around 50 planets hoping for a village to generate to progress the main story.

There is alot more tiny annoyances in the game but its just best to instead ignore this game and spend your money on something better, buy at your own expense kind of deal.

Theres some variety and charm in the random gen worlds to run around in, and even though the main story is as generic as you could possibly get I thought the races all had their own little character to them.

Starbound as a game is interesting. The gameplay itself is honestly kind of meh, but the interactions with lore and friends you can have is what makes the game super enjoyable. All these concepts it throws at you is, to me at least, the true best part of this game. In the vanilla game alone, we get 6 new species to play around with, each coming with their own backstories. Florans? Plant humanoids that see everything meat based as food, which certainly makes for great player interactions. Avians? Extremely religious bird people. Apex? Technologically advanced but more ape like than humans. Novakids? Player's interpretation. That's the one thing I dislike about the game, novakids have such potential that is just never met. 
The workshop is perhaps the next greatest thing about this game, as the community is just so darn creative. Entire species, worlds, hell even story lines can be found. That just adds to the gameplay and concepts that you get, and with the right mindset you can turn a simply pixel game about killing a planet eating tentacle monster into practically anything else. That tentacle monster still might prevail but that's okay, cuz it's a badass creation. 
Alright last block: Starbound is a game I'd recommend, only for you and your good friends where you can say the most random things. The game is amazing, the lore even better, and it will take up a lot of time if it hooks you. Optimization is god awful but if you've found this game and review then you likely already knew that.",1650773939,1670730986,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- nice soundtrack
- good visuals
- a lot of different stuff to do
- many quests
- a really big universe to explore
- you can be a bounty hunter!
- you can also build your own space station

Cons:
- quests get repetitive and boring fast
- after exploring a few of the different solar systems, the planets all start to look the same
- main story feels forced and boring
- the choice of the player race has no influence on the gameplay whatsoever
- the npcs feel superficial and don't have a personality

Conclusion:
While Starbound is game with room for a lot of improvement, you can lose hours and hours in this game before you don't have anything to do anymore. For a lot of the cons mentioned are also a plethora of mods available to fix almost all of them.

Personally, I recommend installing Elithian Races and/or Fracking Universe for a lot more content to explore and lose yourself in.",1630055245,1670109506,True,1,0,0.51044386625289917,0,True,False,False

Pros: Infinite exploration, tons of things to explore and discover, a diverse cast of characters to play from, and unique sets of weapons to use and mess around with. It's got a rich environment with a really charming pixelated style that goes with it, and honestly? I'm all here for it! There's been a lot of changes in the recent years that make this game worth coming back to for, and a rich modding community that really brings it all together, take your pick of the liter and go hog wild!

Cons: The story is super short, and leaves you feeling like, ""Really? That's it?"". The game is horrendously optimized, basically being held together by bubblegum, duct tape, and a dream. The lag can get horrendous sometimes, and really leave you wondering how it even got jumpstarted in the first place with the spaghetti code it's practically holding onto for dear life for. It needs mods to really extend the game and its replayability, otherwise, I hardly see it being worthwhile trying to play this game again without mods like Frackin Universe, and so on.

Overall Review: 5/10 game without mods. 9/10 - 9.5/10 game with mods.",1669807851,1669807851,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every choice made post-beta seems to have been made with the express intention of ruining what made the game fun in service of some dickhead lead dev's ego, and it's horribly sad because the overall aesthetic of this game is incredible.

But i think it says a lot that the races in the game have far surpassed the game itself in popularity, and will definitely outlive it.

Looking back on the dev history, the best I can describe this game with is that it was a bait and switch; It retains virtually nothing of value that the original concrpt had in service of a forced story that no one wanted.

The different races used to have unique background histories, traits, and so on. Weather used to be important. Traveling the stars used to mean something because the further you wanted to go, the more fuel you needed.

So much has been lost. Maybe one day I'll see about grabbing a pre-1.0 version of the game, but the current game is horrendously boring.",1669685529,1669685529,False,6,0,0.535520195960998535,0,True,False,False

It's ""almost"" like No Man's Sky meats Stardew Valley. It satisfies in its own unique way but unfortunately that's where it ends. It plays more like a proof of concept rather than a full experience.

---

This will be my fifth or so time playing through the game. I've done 3 unmodded playthroughs and 2 modded ones using Frackin' Universe. While I can positively say modding can help push the game in desired directions the game overall can be described as unconcerned for anything that isn't forced progression.

There is a main story. It's rather short all things considered and the length is made up of about 60% planet exploring and 40% dungeons. It's not a terrible spread however the implementation leaves a lot to be desired. The game is centred around galaxy exploration and while it does succeed in giving you plenty of room to explore there is zero incentive to re-visit any location beyond your own curiosity or creativity. Frackin' Universe helps alleviate some of the problem here but it's still a persisting issue. There simply isn't any actual reason to care about these locations.

Exploring the galaxy gets progressively more difficult and by extension annoying as you progress. The idea itself is awesome and the planets themselves are cool but the reality is so much more painful. The issue, for me at least, is that there's zero incentive for you to do anything beyond just explore and mine a planet, build a set of Tier ""whatever"" gear, do a dungeon, and move on. By the time you complete the dungeon you've wiped the slate clean. Even if you do get better gear you aren't likely to get anything that improves upon the experience leading to this point. 

A lot of things like colony management, space stations, vehicles, and tech are more proofs of concept than functioning features. None of the aspects of this game beyond exploring planets is essential to progressing. Just as you aren't required to take part in these extra additions you are not required to complete the story missions beyond the Erchius Mining Facility - it's that dungeon that's just tutorial filler (Frackin' Universe does this better, just FYI).

PROS:
- Soundtrack
- Modding
- Things to do
- Combat is rather satisfying
- Dungeons can be appealing depending on your perspective
- Open-ended gameplay
- Non-forced story
- World generation is alright

CONS:
- Some planets feel too generic and bland while others are just too annoying to explore despite being cool. They are essentially just ""running simulators"" where you might as well just destroy the landscape mining for that one material. Some vehicles trivialise walking at all to the point it's depressing losing your ride, like losing a Sparrow in Destiny 2. 

- Story kind of just ""ends"". There is next to no real content or story after finishing the main story. There is an end game but with few environments even being much of a bother at this point it doesn't matter. I barely understand the end game myself as I simply can't care enough to really dive into it. All I know is it seems pretty shallow.

- Planet exploration is used as filler during the story leading to essentially run length padding and needing to rush one of the game's core defining aspects. I would prefer visiting these worlds and learning about the species in a natural and organic way rather than through pointless fetch quests. There's no variety whatsoever in how it's handled and you learn nothing about the universe you're in. Padding, nothing more. I'd rather learn about each race's artifact by doing special quests for them where you can learn about their culture and gain their people's trust. Instead you just ""invade"" people's worlds, steal their planets resources, pilfer through cultural centres and holy ground, and then just expect people to give you their whole race's most treasured belongings.

- Colony development and NPC settlements are seriously lacking. It's literally just fetch quests and bounties. Even in your own colony you are simply an errand boy. Every settlement and colony feels and plays the same way all that changes is the layout.

- Side quests are non-existent. I find it ironic how Dreadwing and the penguins might as well be one of the most iconic and interesting parts of the game - even so much as to have a penguin as the game icon at one point - yet they consist of one of the maybe 3 side quests.

- Everything Erchius related just being so annoying people made mods that remove them. Seriously.

- Dungeons don't have enough variety in their design and encounters to be memorable. If anything it's the grievances that you remember more than anything.

- The Matter Manipulator sucks when trying to build. Like honestly. Tell me why I need to have an 8x8 mining grid destroying my build when it'd be simpler to just do what Terraria did? Unless there's something I'm missing this really is a negative for me.

I feel like the game, really, has been abandoned by the devs. Entire sections of the game could use some tweaks and overhauling. It just doesn't feel refreshing to play the game after a while. Once you've beaten the game and explored a bit of everything you say ""Wow, well that's another game done.""

Here's a quick summary of the dungeons:

Erchius Mining Facility: If you don't have good enough gear this place will be annoying. So annoying the modding community even made mods so you don't have to go here. It's essentially a tutorial dungeon, but it doesn't do anything to improve or expand upon what you've learnt leading up to this point.

Ceremonial Hunting Grounds: Ranged combat is forced a decent amount here. It's got a good mix of traps, puzzles, and combat. A proper first dungeon.

Grand Pagoda Library: It's a dreaded water level. The lead up to this place is tedious. Scanning Hylotl planets is slow and boring. The library is guaranteed to kill you via fall damage at least a few times.

Sovereign Temple: Annoying. Everything about the temple is annoying. It's an ancient Avian temple full of guardians and traps but everything hurts a ton so you're mostly just heal stalling. Not a fun experience.

Miniknog Stronghold: Actually not a half bad dungeon. I just REALLY wish the focus was actually what was going on the surface. 

The Baron's Keep: The fight you wish was in the dungeon before this one, tbh. It's that one Terraria invasion event nobody likes. You'll know what I mean if you get this far.

Ancient Vaults: No difference between these and those ancient challenge doors you find sometimes on planets. These ones have a big bad boss and a reward you'll probably never care too much about. I barely even know what these vaults are about because by that point I activate admin powers and Thanos snap the vault guardian away.

So the end verdict?

I rate Starbound a decent 6.5/10. It's a good enough experience to be considered a game but it isn't fleshed out enough to be considered a full experience. Some elements are simply too barebones to even be considered any more than beta tests. I think with some overhauling either from devs or through mods it can be brought to a 7.5/10. I don't think the game will get better than that though.",1669358329,1669358329,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDIT: Bumping this down to an 8 / 10 for two reasons: 
1.) Found out that Chucklefish didn't pay their developers. I do NOT support that and will NEVER support that. 
2.) There are bugs and other issues in the game that made it hard for me to keep playing. The three big ones were (a) the game crashing (or slowing down to the point of near-crashing) whenever I fought a boss, (b) a slight lack of direction, and (c) the learning curve. 
In defense of my first major issue, the computer I played Starbound on likely had the minimum requirements for the game. I'll definitely get back to this point once I give the game another go (I haven't played the game since 2020); however, other friends that have played Starbound with much better specs have complained of the same issue. 
In defense of the other two major issues I had, the game has quests and plotlines. However, I didn't always find it easy to remain consistently interested. 
As for the learning curve, it could have just been me having a skill issue -- I like exploring new places, but I'm more of an architect than a fighter. That being said, when I moved from the starter planets to the next difficulty level of planets whilst decently equipped, I still struggled at times. Again, maybe I just need to get good, and I'll update this review once I play the game again. 
The issues I have with it aren't enough for me to stop recommending it, however. I still love the music and artstyle of this game. Furthermore, the game's exploration process can be really fun, and I had a blast building to my heart's content. If you like building and exploring, this game might be fun for you -- especially if you have friends to play with. Just keep in mind this experience might not be the most polished. Also, Novakid best playable characters.
On a side note, I can also recommend No Man's Sky if planet exploration is your cup of tea.

ORIGINAL REVIEW (kinda):
Decided to rewrite my review now that I have more hours on it. 

Starbound... damn, where do I begin with this game? It's very fun, there's limitless potential, and the lore is solid yet complex. It can be pretty difficult at times, though. The music and artstyle of the game are also very good. It's as if every planet has had every detail figured out beforehand. The NPCs, the monsters, the items... it's your world.

Some weapons are cool don't get me wrong but most of the time you're getting duds. Combat is weird because it's got that variety that people like but it's energy is not that great. I don't get adrenaline pumped into my veins but it does allow any class to be viable (except throwing. we dont talk about throwing.)
However, where this game shines over its peers is it's building.
You literally have full control of your area, planet, buildings, colors, furniture, placement, and with hundreds if not thousands of furniture to choose from, practically anything is possible. Heck, if you want you can go for a space station.

It offers a variety of fun stuff, whether it is fighting spawns, digging, building colonies or farms, fighting with mechs or building them or searching for loot, playable instruments and items. Planets and star systems are generated procedurally and never the same, similarly the enemies can vary in a number of aspects. Even lots of Workshop items offer more and more customisations – especially ""Frackin' Universe"" is a blast!

While being fun, Starbound also has some issues. Even single player games suffer from memory leaks resutling in lags (PC versions get better when playing in 32 bit versions), also the end game content gets boring after quite a while, whereas the campaign is a little bit too repetitive. Since it is rather old (released 22nd of July 2016) no more development appears to be taking place.

It offers a lot, but still lacks some minor stuff.

On a side note the developer's logo animation and sound (first after starting the game) are probably one of the cutest there is. ;)",1668693175,1668693175,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Still, I can't play a game for as long as I have with this one and say it is bad.  It is fun to come back to every now and explore another world, or build another base.

It does a lot of interesting things, but it can get very grindy and slow at times.  I've for example played this game for close to 100 hours as of this writing, but I have never had the patience to invest the time in building a good mech.  

Some of the bosses were frustrating and much more difficult than the exploration part of the game, but there is a lot of variation and they do something different with each one.  I also think it loses a few points for being derivative of other games that do similar things, often doing them better.

In general, this game has a lot of good ideas included, but they are executed in ways that feel just off enough that they fall short and it is easy to focus on the areas in which it falls short.  At the same time though, there is a lot of game here, and most of it works pretty well.

A sci-fi pixelart space-exploration based sandbox is a combination of things that in my opinion make the perfect game. Sadly, in the base game its never fully fleshed out in a cool way but mods *almost* elevate it to what it could be. Playing with mods is definitely a MUST for this game.



Old Review: 
It really hurts me to see how badly the devs fumbled this title. A 2d pixelart sci-fi exploration based sandbox game was my personal dream come true but sadly it was rushed and died halfway to the finish line.

After playing around enough with mods I've realized that they just kind of build upon the already mediocre base of this game and it ultimately still feels the same, no matter how many new species, weapons or planet types it adds.

I remember being so frustrated with it in its earlier builds, and at one point i just gave up and didnt touch it for years. i picked it up the other day, though. i was thinking ""well maybe since its finished, it might be fun.""

its not, its not fun at all. im not even past the tutorial. i wish i could be, the game looks very fun beyond it, but theres just no way to play it casually. the beginning of the game locks you on rails, providing you with a very vague mission to ""repair your ship"" so that you can explore the rest of the world. it then deposits you on some hostile world, with only a little arrow to guide you in the general direction of where your supposed to be, and no idea what you're supposed to be doing. your only weapon is an old sword that requires you to get very close to enemies, all of which are faster and more agile than you. did i mention how bad the platforming is? you get caught on the slightest thing, and the second you do a mob decends from the sky and chews up half your health. there are no checkpoints, everytime you die you have to start all over. 

the game just doesnt tell you what to do. this wouldnt be a problem if i could do whatever i wanted, but its story really locks me into this one garbage planet and provides you with one borderline useless navigational tool. exploring isn't fun, its agony. its hard to tell whats in the background, and what's in the foreground. transversal is difficult, youve got to hold the spacebar down to get your full jump height. if you're just a little bit off, it leaves you wide open for some mob to come and kill you.

the mission hints exist, but they only update when you are within proxemity to wherever you're supposed to be. these planets are very large, and you can spend hours, directionless, until you trip over something thats actually relevant to you. once you've accomplished whatever it is, you're back to square one, because it certainly wont tell you whats next. 

i did the first mission out of order. i went to the mine first, where some sort of prompt prompted me to collect a bunch of little red gems. turns out what you're supposed to do before that is go a million miles in the other direction, find a teleporter that doesnt work, turn back around, find the mine, and then return to the teleporter with the gems. if you missed the teleporter, because maybe you decided to go RIGHT instead of LEFT, you'll have no idea what to do with these gems. the game tells you to collect twenty of them, and once you do, its radio silence.

i ended up having to google the solution for this mission, and the next. it wasnt too hard, because google autofilled the problem i was having, and provided me with pages and pages of forums of people also not knowing what they were supposed to be doing.

sometimes, you have to talk to NPCs. they talk very slowly, and their dialog is unskippable. dungeon crawling is agony, as the little direction indicator doesnt guide you around pathways. if you save at all before your first checkpoint and close the game, youll wake up back on your ship, requiring to transverse the entire world again and again. 

im playing all of this on casual mode. i didnt really anticipate my platforming skill being key to like, get past the tutorial.",1668055460,1668055460,False,1,0,0.472751140594482422,0,True,False,False

Starbound has always been one of those consistent games I fall back to when sifting through my owned steam games, if there isn't anything else, booting this game up every few months to even years just made sense because the visuals and general gameplay are inviting and cater to what I want as a player!

This game is pretty, and you can make pretty stuff with it, even with just the base game (the modding community is VAST and has carried this game's playerbase for a while now)

I adore the game for what it is and what it's good at, and finally actually finishing the campaign this year felt like a long-awaited and satisfying thing to do in itself. BUT that's the exact issue
*It took me FIVE SOME ODD YEARS to finally getting around to finishing it*

The campaign is the weakest part of the whole game honestly, the story is linear and the whole ""search-and-scan"" progression style is repetitive and not very engaging, in a game where you are meant to explore the universe there sure isn't much to really look for here, besides a few books and some dialogue blurbs you don't get any real eye-catchers. From what I hear about the promises that the devs made for this game in early development and what the final product ended up being, it seems like this aspect of the experience has disappointed quite a few people, but personally even with those short-comings, what the game DOES execute well is enough for me.

It's fun to make a vibrant and fun settlement with friends, to pick a race and learn about the little details each culture has. It's also fun to upgrade your ship and fill it with penguin crewmates, or to customize and deploy a mech to different missions and planets.

I go back to Starbound for the things I know that I enjoy because I've had it so long and know what to expect, but if what I've described doesn't seem like enough? I would give it a pass, you won't miss too much.

*TLDR*

I've had this game for years and love the sandbox portion of it but the campaign is lacking and the world isn't as vast as it feels like it should be. I like it for what it is.

PROS
----
>Very nice, timeless visuals.
>Interesting Race Choices (Plant People, Conspiracy Apes, Backwards Compatible Robots)
>Great potential for fun nights with friends
>Large library of interesting mods (This can practically be the selling point of this game with how much more you can add)
>Satisfying sandbox elements
>Cool looking Weapons/Armor to find and craft! (Some of the unique weapons are genuinely very cool)

CONS
----
>Bland, boring, linear campaign
>Lack of push to explore very much
>Fun (but limited) amount of environments to see (dungeons, settlements, etc.)
>Enough content for the price (But you'll need quite a few mods if you have the itch for something new.)

I'm never going to forget this game, I'm glad I found it and I'm even more glad I finished it, I'm still going to come back to it again at some point but that doesn't mean it's for everyone, I don't recommend going in expecting the whole world, but what you do get is more than enough for me.

[b]First things first[/b]: this game is different from Terraria. In Terraria you dig down, everytime finding better ores to build better tools that you let you mine even better ores. In Starbound, you have a tool that can mine everything from the beginning. also, early in the game you get access to a mech suit capable of mining everything even faster. so the focus is moving between planets, because no planet has all available ores or monsters or materials. in the meantime, you can build houses in  these plantes (teleport is available, too), build starbases, and upgrade your spaceship. and do quests. there are lots of NPCs across the universe with quests. 

[u]now, the bad part:[/u]

[b]there is no serious tutorial[/b]: only a five-minute 'mission' to show how to use some tools, and that's it. you don't really know what should be built, or how to grow plants. the Don't Starve series title is more informative than the Starbound tutorial.
[b]the battle system is completely unbalanced[/b] from the very beginning. it's so unbalanced that Thanos would have seizures by just looking at it. The first monsters can kill you with 2 or 3 hits. they jump and dash towards you.
[b]the first mission is completely crazy[/b]. you need to get to the core of a planet. you just started the game and have to get to a planet center, with lame digging tools and almost no fighting equipment. with monsters that can kill you as fast as saying ""blarrghh"". oh, and you constantly falling in holes/caves full of these monsters.
[b]you can't aim up and down when fighting[/b]! I mean, with guns you can. but not with swords. why??? plus, the terrains have LOTS of mountains, so you find yourself constantly swinging a sword 10cm above a monster that is not hit by it.
[b]the hunger system[/b] adds NOTHING to the gameplay. really nothing, its just boring. a hunger bar that lower over time, so you must eat to avoid losing health. no other needs, only hunger. it gives the impression that when the game was ready, the devs said ""hey, let me just add a hunger bar in 5min before launching the game"".
and last, but not least: [b]NPCs are RETARDED[/b]. you constantly get quests from NPCs, and lots of these are about rescuing someone from some other place in the planet you are. so you fight all over the way there, with all the combat issues, find said NPC, and start to escort him/her back to complete the quest. but remember, NPCs in this game are RETARDED. so the NPC keeps moving around you like a fly moving around a lightbulb, even when you are figthing hostiles! not only they do that, but they also constantly fall in holes or caves and get killed by monsters you aren't even fighting! and there is no option to issue them an order to keep standing in some place; they are always around you. I have no words to describe this situation other than infuriating. they do that ALL the time. oh, and you can try to protect the NPCs, but remember: you can't aim your sword.


so, these are the issues that moved me from a positive to a negative review. but the battle system, unbalanced gameplay and NPCs IA are the worst ones.

It's very barebones, very repetitive, but the visuals are nice and there's just enough challenge for it to be engaging.

Mods are pretty good for this game, I personally never play without my giant bloated modpack I've been gradually adding to for nearly a decade. I'm usually not the biggest fan of games that advertise themselves as having 'lots of mods' because most of the times the mods for those games don't really add any new content and if they do it's usually pretty mediocre, but I actually really like a lot of the mods here and I think a fair amount of them are up to par or even exceed the base game in terms of quality. It helps that one of the main drives to this game is the exploration, and when you add a ton of random mods, you're really just giving yourself more things to explore.

The devs who made this game are pretty horrible though, there's a long history of worker abuse coming from them. Consider waiting for a steam sale or partaking in 'royalty free entertainment consumption' if you want to play this game.",1468716395,1667768582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is absolutely amazing! Imagine Terraria, but in space, and it has a beautiful soundtrack, a infinite universe to explore, pretty good graphics for a pixelated game, and so much stuff to do. plot is good, bosses are good, and everything is just awesome. The only bad thing is it can sometimes be very laggy and a little unstable, but it's not a overly annoying amount of lag. Really good mod support, good multiplayer, and completely worth the money.

Getting this game was a no brainer. Frankly I was expecting quite literally ""terraria in space"" which would have a direct transfer of everything from terraria but in a space setting. Boy I was pleasantly mistaken! This game is so much more. Perhaps the one thing missing from Terraria was the absense of a story/lore (left mostly up to the player's interpretation). This game makes up for it with a central story and various side quests to justify the in-game setting and keeps players progressing. The quests also serve as a guidance to what players need to go next, as opposed to the rather confusing ""what now?"" issue that new terraria players have.

While starbound's development was shakey at best, in the end they came through in delivering a fun, wholesome game. They haven't bothered their consumers by cutting out content and telling us to pay extra for it through DLC. Instead they've done exactly the opposite - they have developed intuitive, exciting gameplay delivered by free updates. You don't even have to click the ""buy this FREE DLC"" button, it's just given to you. What bros.

Starbound itself is more of a game about building than it is about exploration, which is where Chucklefish went right when they came through with the Colony update. Exploration isn't exciting what so ever, almost every planet is the same. And this is where they fall short - a major point of exploration is that you can see all these sights and views in the distance. This is impossible with the 2D format - where you'll only know you that the planet has impressive mountains until you're climbing up them.

So it could be said that this game is Anethema to No Man's Sky - where No Man's Sky has beautiful views and encourages exploration, Starbound presents a game with challenges, difficulties, and generally fun content for the trade off of lack of an incentive to explore. It does however make up for it's lack of explorative incentive and the restraints of the 2D world by having creative and alien biomes with unique monsters and animals inhabiting them. The only problem is, is that those biomes are still fairly common sights.

The challenges it presents can be in the form of evading rampaging monsters to fighting god-like boss monsters to bringing in bandits (the next free update ;D) to navigating platform obstacle courses. Surviving the night can be a challenge if your equipment simply isn't up-to-par with the local ecosystem. And as an aside to this, the rewards for some of these are actually worth it and interesting - it could be a randomly generated sword that shoots lightning or the pre-scripted sword that rips a whole in the time-space continuum - or a staff that heals allies, or a gun that sets enemies on fire or even the flamethrower. It isn't all weapons either. You can get pokeballs (fucking try saying they aren't pokeballs, Chucklefish), resources, valuable components, generally stuff that is actually kind of hard to come by and is needed to advance in the game.

Yes! There is advancement. There is even a story (this was exciting for those of us who bought it a long time ago)! Personal advancement comes in the form of your ship - which is different for each race. There are 6 (? I forget, might be 5) upgrades which can only be unlocked by recruiting 2 crew members per upgrade. That is unless of course you're a dirty, dirty scumbag who buys a fake license to upgrade your ship, but I won't judge.

The characters you'll find in the game are lacking at best. They typically say one thing, and one thing only, but they pay me to live in my huts so I'm okay with that. I do, however, wish they'd have some variaty in their words. Chucklefish is fairly wholesome, with the NPCs being typically cheery or humorously depressed. You can get them to live in your houses by buying a deed, and if you don't like how they look you can evict them by destroying teh deed and puting it back up. NPCs will walk around and converse with other NPCs, although you can't hear them. They'll run from monsters, or fight back if they're guards. They're fairly worked out - just need some more pathfinding (they tend to get stuck at the bottom of places even though they can walk out) and some new dialogue.

In short, I recommend this game.

Pros:
-Decent amount of content
-Vast semi-randomly generated universe
-Terraria-esque progression
-Game has its own plot and story, which is totally optional
-Instances and missions (some procedurally generated, and some are designed by devs)
-Plenty of things to do once you've got the best gear and finished main questline

Cons:
-No map of current planet you're on
-When you die, you may have a lot of trouble finding your items, since there is no map, and the planets are huge and loop around
-Even though your spaceship orbits around planets, you still aren't able to change your spawnpoint on a given planet, so going back to some locations on bigger planets can be really tedious

Then to implement the space stations as another way to make a base (although they are incredibly inconvenient) just adds more depth to late game exploring/creation.

Most notable is that even when playing Singleplayer you'll likely experience latency issues due to everything essentially functioning on a server. This is because the game calculates the time and position of all planets in a system, or even throughout every system you have generated. Worst part is that enemies will still be able to move even when you're seemingly frozen in time briefly, making the enemies not very fun to fight against. This issue more or less vanished when you're going through various instanced dungeons/missions and the combat becomes tolerable. So... more or less too big of a universe that operates based on a server even when you're playing by yourself and enemies that can still move even you can't. That's the big two. There's another minor complaint in a lack of planet variance where if you have seen one planet type then you've seen them all.

So... what's good? As I'll almost always point to, the OST is pretty decent and I never noticed it ever getting repetitive. Every planet type has its own playlist of music that'll play as you explore the surface or the underground, which has its own playlist of themes too. Also, the building I'll say is better than Terraria's. You have countless block and furniture types to choose from when building a base planetside or customizing the interior of your spaceship. There's even plenty of cosmetic choices for your characters between cosmetic items and armor. Also, the races you can choose from are mainly for looks and some minor weapon variance when crafting. Also, your various mining tools have the ability to mine multiple blocks at once and you can switch between placing blocks 2x2 or just single blocks just by holding down your walk key (shift by default).

So, overall the game has issues but it's not all bad. Even some of the things I listed that I think are bad can remedied with mods if you so wish. Though I'd advise playing through completely vanilla at first before delving into mods.",1564157221,1666295473,True,3,0,0.524691343307495117,0,True,False,False

the game would be 100 times better if for example:

- scaning for missions was non linear = having the game let you explore to find the way to get to the missions based on what you discover would make it diferent to the estigma of boring terraria.

- diferent biome planets have exclusive undergrounds. = this was in the beta. and it was beter like that.

- getting to the main story missions was on ship = giving more direction after findig where to go. and after arriving turn on the transporter to return in any moment while going to other planets

And not only that but when exploring planets you may come across a village of npc's who can also sell you items and give quests. Even if your deep in the world you may come across a house in a cave with some merchants hanging out! And when exploring the depths or mining you can come across chests with loot!

However, it doesn't come without it's flaws - development has laid stagnant since the Bounty Hunter Update 3 years ago now, and performance suffers badly because it's designed to use 1 physical core (and one physical core ONLY, not threads) to compute everything from physics, logic, NPC AI, quests, and even the GRAPHICS. So yes, after a while, especially with a few mods piled on (particularly Build Your Own Ship (BYOS)), it will start to lag quite badly; using the 32-bit version (x64 has a memory leak related to Lua scripting whenever loading gear) and a small bunch mods online can attempt to somewhat ease the load, but won't get you anywhere too far.

I am writing this a while after I played it, so I may be fuzzy on some details.

Where Terraria has a single, large world, this game has many smaller worlds that wrap around horizontally and can be visited one by one. The goal is sort of to make your way through these worlds collecting resources and completing quests. Worlds can be revisited to build a farm or a cool structure or just to get some more resources.

You travel between these worlds with your spaceship, which is a little, expanding build that you bring with you where you go. You don't get much much creative control over it, but it lets you bring all the stored items with you.

Personally I never bothered building anything nice on planets, but I don't really do that in Terraria either.

Compared to Terraria, there seems to be a more focused progression, with a storyline and a clarity of goals that Terraria lacks, as well as an actual ending. The combat also seems more measured, as contrasted with Terraria's crazy speeds and variety of approaches.

I played the game with a mod that makes storage inventories huge, because I find inventory management to be terribly uncompelling in this type of game. To the game's credit, it made it very easy to use that mod.

Overall, I think this is a solid game. It doesn't give you as much [i]game[/i] for your money as Terraria does, but not many games do. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Terraria and wants a bit more. Perhaps I would also recommend it to people for whom Terraria is too vague.",1665817080,1665817080,True,11,0,0.654264330863952637,0,True,False,False

Starbound, la experiencia cooperativa definitiva *voz de comercial* jaja que delicia de juego, siento que aún no vi nada, y necesito más. Es que el modelo de universo casi infinito está muy pero muy bien simulado, y todo el tiempo alimenta tus ganas de explorar y verlo todo, armar incontables colecciones de.. lo que sea! y tener una casa en cada bioma cool, no solo porque hay casas geniales abandonadas, que sería un desperdicio y una tristeza absoluta que nadie use, además quién no querria de vecinos a unos hombre-*por*hongo, sapos gigantes o alpacas armadas hasta los dientes; sino porque el juego va incrementando tu creatividad hora tras hora, y cuando querés acordar sos el mejor arquitecto surealista de la galaxia(!) y tenés que dar rienda suelta a tus sueños de contrucción alocada, claro que sí. No hay razones válidas para no darle una palmadita en la espalda a tu niño interior, que tenés 33 años y no te acordas la última vez que usaste tus legos? No importa, hay cosas que nunca se olvidan, como andar en bicicleta.


Este juego es entrañable, y lo recomiendo a casi cualquier público (menos a vos que tenés el alma seca y arrugada como una uva pasa)

The story goes that you are a member of a massive intergalactic alliance of intelligent civilizations in the far-flung future called the Protectorate. This alliance was formed in response to the birth of an entity known as The Ruin, which was an incredibly powerful cosmic entity that had a bitter hatred for all life and goodness and sought to destroy all of it. This entity was stopped by another equally powerful being called the Cultivator, who sought to protect and nurture life in the universe. But in doing so, the Cultivator gave up their powers and ceased to be. After that, the Cultivator chose six different intelligent species to protect the universe from evil in his absence and gave them ""keys"" to a failsafe that would allow them to defeat the ruin should it ever rise again. Well, when you start the game, a ceremony on earth officially welcoming you into the protectorate is abruptly brought to a halt when the Ruin makes a sudden reappearance and destroys earth. You hijack a small space vessel and flee the planet, taking much damage in the process but nonetheless making it out alive. The end result is that you awaken in your ship orbiting an uncharted planet, and it's your goal to fix your ship, travel the universe, and find the six keys you need to destroy the ruin forever.

Honestly, it's got amazing gameplay. It's in the 2D style, much like Terraria. But the difference is that you have a massive universe full of procedurally generated planets to travel around and harvest resources and build neat things. You can expand your spaceship and build practically anything you want in it, even turn it into your own cozy little home. You can acquire a great deal of weapons, clothing, armors, gadgets, collectibles, and even vehicles. You can visit all types of settlements on planets, each with their own aesthetics and architecture. One type is modeled after an orwellian dictatorship. Another is modeled to be like a feudal kingdom. Another is a theocracy. They all have their own fully fleshed out cultures, traditions, languages, and history. It's incredibly fascinating and frankly, All of this, combined with the fact that this game is highly moddable and has a large, thriving modding community, I would dare say there is thousands of hours of content even after beating the main storyline. If you're looking for your next addiction, this is absolutely worth the price.",1577844212,1664524307,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing . I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories.

I've come back to this game as I've gone through a game drought throughout the year. Do I still recommend this game? To an extent. It follows a specific niche as with any sandbox orientated game; you're forced to create your own story alongside the main game's story, should it be provided.

Starbound has a interesting story; not in a good or bad way. I believe that the story was much more illustrative with its mission designs + music to show you a story, rather than tell you. Not to say that it doesn't tell you anything- it does, but it isn't super deep. The jist being that you're finding artifacts from a select few races to face and destroy the Ruin. There's not a whole lot of exposition regarding why we should deem the Ruin as a threat, as they are hardly ever seen in the game excluding the two missions that are at the start then end of the game. My guess would be that the Cult is meant to stand in for them, but I never found them to be super imposing. They weren't ""progressive with the story"", even when you do the Peacekeeper quest; they didn't act like a cult but rather a generic goon-based faction.

The Loyalist Apex being under the Miniknog issue was a story in of itself but it was never expanded beyond the mission you learn of their antics- a mod expands upon this (Starforge, I believe?) by adding the Unbound. Anything expands the (arguably) short and simple story can make the game more enjoyable for people looking forward to playing a story-orientated game.

That being said, if you're looking for a story orientated game, I advise checking other games unless you want something short and sweet.

A huge talking point to me is the atmosphere and music of the game. All I need to say is that this is the type of music you'd vibe to in many scenarios. And if you're not vibing, you're relaxing to a methodical orchestral melody. The music alone is far more expansive than the story is trying to be and what it wants to be- recommend listening to the ""Jupiter"" track (a fine damn shame that it isn't on the OST...)- it's a strong song that can easily sum of the premise of the story (""Everything you had was lost. All your friends, gone. Nothing remained but you and your ship. But the stars out there beckon for your arrival and exploration. And who knows... maybe there is a small remnant of what you remember being what used to be a part of you- go on and be free."")

Starbound is one of the few games that I've played that has a OST that is complementary to the scenarios you are- the other game being Halo (especially Martin O'Donnell, Michael Salvatori and Steve Vai). I was surprised to see that Toby Fox was involved with the game when I glanced at the credits the 2nd time I played through the game. However much involvement he had, if any, I can tell there was some influence. 

The music is simply exemplary, nostalgic, and timeless. A quality that few games I've played and heard of that reach this qualitative perfection. But that's my opinion.

I'm not a huge gameplay nerd unless the experience is too janky. Starbound's control scheme and UI is simple if not a bit annoying at times (your inventory always going to your middle), but it's not horrible or unplayable. 

Comparisons to Terraria? They're there, but it's often something very specific and niche; I believe there's enough difference between the two games to make them much more distinct. I'd give many examples but I'd end up making a document on the differences. The main ones I'd like to point out is that Starbound as a actual by-definition story, bearing that you go on a series of quests from the start and end with a motive. Does this mean Terraria has no story? Not exactly, if you want to count obtaining all the Town NPCs and defeating all the bosses as a story whilst understanding the original out-of-the-game 'lorebook' of Terraria.

If you can find significant replay value with Starbound- friends or not, then it's a good game. But I would strongly advise looking forward to the content-based mods (stay away from the workshop if you're extremely sensitive to NSFW, apparently people have a pixel-kink...), as they heavily improve upon the game. 

If you're looking for a time killer, I suppose the base game + various amounts of mods make this a good game for killing time. There's alternatives for sure, but I do appreciate some time into this game from time to time.

All in all? I'd give it a 8/10. I like the atmosphere the game has alongside its music, but the story could use some improvements in its length and depth. The music is simply astonishing and I'll never forget it.

ORIGINAL; 1st time review
Jan 2, 2021 @ 7:49pm

Outstanding game if you've played other 2D Adventure games. While many will compare this to Terraria, and they're not wrong on that front, Starbound offers so much more content comparatively. Both games can suffer in the replayability factor, but Starbound not as much since there's quite a load of things you can do.

I'd heavily suggest playing the game and beating it first before you start running complicated mods (FU as a example). Though, minor mods like Weapons and whatnot are pretty fine in my book.

Honestly my first impression was bad and I even wanted to neg review it, then I got out of the first planet and it blows your mind with stuff, but once I sorted everything out 50 hours later I was, like, ""that's it?"". 

Starbound is a game that lacks depth. It got breadth instead. I might even go as far as to call it a collection of minigames. 

The core of Starbound consists of the following:

[list]
[*] [b]main game[/b] - it's your classic minecraft-like survival that consists of a cycle of search minerals - upgrade equipment - go up a difficulty tier - repeat; do it six times and lose reason to dig down below ever again. Only reason it'll take more than 5-6 hours is them making the baseline mining speed damn slow. 
[*] [b]main story[/b] - it's a combination of exploration and metroidvania, it's cool and I got nothing bad to say about it.
[*] [b]sub story[/b] - a roguelike game mode where you take the role of a space cop and arrest criminals hiding on different planets; kinda grindy, but arguably one of the best experiences the game has to offer and the benefits are adequate. 
[*] [b]sub game[/b] - a side scroller shooter where you pilot the mech through space. Looks neat at first but it's kinda pointless, repetitive, clunky and not very fun by itself, and very, very grindy, honestly I couldn't bear to see the end of it. What's a high end mech is good for? Well, it's necessary for some of the sub story missions. Other than that you can beam mech down the planet and use it for exploration, but it isn't terribly efficient and you've got a time limit. That's about it. 
[/list]

There are also several collection minigames:
[list]
[*] [b]Cooking[/b] - a minigame where you scour planets for edible plants, build a megafarm and explore the cook book. Just in case you miss Stardew Valley for some reason. 
[*] [b]Fishing[/b] - your typical fishing minigame, very grindy, very stupid and virtually no reason to play it seriously. 
[*] [b]Monster Taming[/b] - a minigame where you capture monsters by throwing a ball in them, then you would be able to use them in combat. Unfortunately there are no evolutions and no gym leaders, cocky rivals and single letter evil teams to beat the crap off.
[*] [b]Archaelogy[/b] - a minigame similar to battleship where you scour depths for fossils so that you could build your own theme park, with blackjack and dinos. 
[*] [b]Bug Catching[/b] - a nerdier version of Archaelogy, just in case you've got a spare several dozen of hours so that you could brag to your friends about it.
[*] [b]Figurine Collection[/b] - a simulator of the korean MMO drop rates that will make you wish there was a real money cash shop. 
[/list]

The endgame offers you random metroidvania dungeons where you could grind for resource to be able to do things that are kinda redundant by that point anyway. Or at least that's what the game sells you as endgame, but it's not a true endgame. True endgame is building gigantic colonies and populating them with NPCs so that you could brag about it on Reddit. If you haven't turned a single planet into Coruscant you didn't really play Starbound, sorry. 

Bottomline is I liked the game a lot and it was very much worth it for me, but it's not really the kind of game to come back into because every new playthrough will feel rather same-y as the previous one.",1663016721,1663047944,True,22,0,0.695088088512420654,0,True,False,False

At the very first part of the game it is a master piece, designed very well and fun, and it continues like that for a while but however eventually it has the same problem seen in games like no man’s sky. It just drags on and on and on.
I get that things do change but it feels as if I’m just doing the same thing over and over with slight changes.
It’s a decent game, maybe get it if it’s on sale? But while the game is still decent I feel like it gets overshadowed by the direction the developers somewhat force you into going with little way to diverge whilst still progressing.

I know that's how progression works in games but it still feels bad as i struggle to see change in quests as it just feels like i need to do the same thing over and over.

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

The story isn't anything impressive but it's not all that important after the initial start to the game. You will make your own story. It will be born of your experiences and desires. I've had numerous characters live completely different lives.

Wanna be a bounty hunter? A freighter pilot? A colony manager? A farmer? A soldier? This game's got you covered. Keep your expectations realistic and you won't be disappointed. The systems for all these things exist but when you have this many all in one game, you already know that they can only get so deep. However, you can switch gears anytime you want and do whatever interests you in the moment.

Artwork and music are charming. Combat kinda favors melee weapons which is disappointing but, you can brute force your way or use mods to achieve viable ranged options. Lore is actually pretty interesting (wasn't really expecting much in that regard but found myself collecting books and reading them as I went).

I definitely recommend watching some Let's Plays just for diligence sake but I doubt you'll regret buying this.

In most cases, I would say this meant the official death of the game - but in this case... It's a win for us.

The last two major updates for Starbound increased lag both incrementally and with major lag spikes happening due to some kind of processing in the background (I believe these are related to the Bounty Hunter system, but the lag occurs even without accessing the bounty system so... I could be wrong)

Many months have passed since Chucklefish stepped away and yet today alone we've seen another 4 mods added to the Workshop and hundreds, possibly thousands, of mods are still being actively updated. If you own this game and use a lot of mods you will undoubtedly see daily downloads added to your Steam Downloads page each day because of mod updates, (But each update is like 200 KB, so it's nothing lol)

On to the pros and cons...

PROS
~ Unique universe is generated when playing for the first time, giving you a one of a kind universe populated with countless stars, each of which is orbited by roughly half a dozen planets and/or moons.
~ Randomly generated gear means you can get some really cool stuff with interesting abilities even very early on.
~ Hundreds of unique blocks you can use to build with, and all building blocks can be placed in the foreground (where you can walk on them) or the background (so they form a backdrop) which is a vast improvement over things like Terraria's ""wall"" blocks that drastically limit creativity by ensuring you only have a couple dozen blocks to use as background blocks for your builds.
~ Beautiful sprite based graphics, with sound quality to match.
~ Clean user interface, allowing for ease of use and ease of learning.
~ A main quest line that has you visiting many interesting places, introducing you to various mechanics along the way.
~ Dozens of unique instruments that can be used alongside an expansive music library to play music in game - even in a band with friends!
~ Jump-in/Jump-out multiplayer with no need to set up dedicated servers! (But you can set up and run dedicated servers if you choose to!)
~ Combat is well balanced (for those who don't want things too hard or too easy)
~ Casual difficulty option for those who want a simpler, easier experience (also useful for just building for fun!)
~ Active community, even after the developers/publishers have completely given up on the game - With over 800 members in the Group Chat as the writing of this review! (And I didn't even know that feature existed until today lol)
~ MODS.

CONS
~ With so many things randomly generated, you will soon lose interest in the tens of thousands of planets you've never seen.
~ Drops being completely random means that you might have trouble finding exactly what you're looking for.
~ You may need to go to dozens of planets to find one specific thing you are looking for - either materials or objects that you must scan as part of the main quest line.
~ Certain mechanics are extremely limited in what you can do with them, while others provide the player with incredible depth and potential.
~ Mod mismatch is possible, and when you and your friends have different mods the game can sometimes crash or behave unexpectedly. There is a setting to prevent playing with others who do not have the same mods, but other mod systems (such as tModLoader for Terraria) allow the player to download the missing mods when they are trying to join and that feature is sorely missed here.
~ Toxic community members - They exist in every community, but it warrants a mention here regardless. If you spend a bit of time in the community you'll easily be able to spot these jerks. You know who you are, so there's no need for me to point fingers or say names.

That's about all I have to say in my completely overhauled Starbound review. Comments are enabled, so give me a piece of your mind, and I'll answer any questions I feel I can.

But after a lengthy development, the focus shifted into giving the game a strong central storyline, that forced players into performing deeds on specific planets. Searching for ages for a certain thing because the game's told you to do so. Which was... not the charm of these kinds of games. The decision sent a lot of players packing. There were also many changes to how the armour works, and after what appeared to be a lot of work, the game still felt oddly balanced. Like a lot of items just didn't mean or do anything unique. Some weapons were just blatantly overpowered. Monsters in general felt dumb and weak.

To me, the shift in focus definitely killed the enjoyment of exploration. I really liked not being anyone in particular in this game, with a wide dangerous universe out there to explore piece by piece. With all of this responsibility to save the universe, there isn't really a whole bunch of time for ME, so when I am buying pets (yes there are pets) and decorating my ship, I feel like a jerk for doing it, because I should be out being a hero.

It took me a lot of mods to restore that feeling of an open universe. And by the end of it, the A.I / depth of the game's systems just wasn't there to keep me around. Sure, you could make some massive Habbo Hotel style thinger, on a deserted island on a Paradise planet, make yourself a lightsaber, and spend all day raking in the cash from punters and doing Luke Skywalker front flips off a diamond diving board into the sea.

But if you stop using your imagination and look at what's going on, the npcs are not using anything, or interacting, or doing anything in particular. Some of them are glitching out into walls, or can't figure out how to navigate the terrain. None of them have any depth beyond a simple repeating, random quest system, so after the first 5 minutes of engaging with these npcs you've seen it all.

Starbound, graphically, tonally, feels like it should be deeper, but it just isn't, so it feels weird playing it after a while. The success of it was partly because of the timing of the game's release, but there is still a lot of fun to be had here, I mean look how long I've played it before getting soulcrushingly bored.

Imagine watching the same movie, or going on the same ride in a theme park for 563 hours. You'd lose your mind right? It's a testament to how much stuff you can add to this experience yourself, in the sandbox itself if you have a great imagination, and also to how much you can add using mods. There is a specific mod, a huge one, that you can grab on the workshop, that dramatically changes the game, adding a new path you can take instead of the main story that is more open.",1477126393,1662199796,True,1,1,0.505494534969329834,0,True,False,False

On the surface, this is a very pretty looking game with at times rough gameplay that can easily be fixed with the dozens of community made mods. I start having problems though, when you begin to peel back that first layer to reveal all the shady shit that's been going on underneath. 

I'd thoroughly encourage anyone reading this review to look into this themselves but I will provide a summary of many of the things I've read.

When it comes to the main game, the development is troubled to say the least. The spriters were forced to learn to code in order to implement their sprites because the coders didn't have enough time to do it themselves. Much of the game's art was taken from impressionable young artists who believed they were getting their foot in the door to be able to work at chucklefish when in reality they were just being used for unpaid labor. As well as the lead developer's alleged tendency to get sexual when he shouldn't. Hell, Toby Fox made music for this game that was rejected and he went unpaid for, that was until undertale blew up at which point it was added without his permission. 

As for the modding community, it's not much better there either. There are plenty of passionate modders here that really improve my view of the scene as a whole, but my main issue comes from the most popular mod, Frackin Universe. The gist here is that the developer of this mod has a tendency to steal content from other mods with no permission and then threaten the developers of the original mod should they not comply. There was also an instance where he made an empty public apology that many people chimed in to debunk. 

It honestly sickens me how much i've spent, and continued to influence my friends into spending on this company. If you're on the fence as to whether you should buy this game or not, don't.",1661656625,1661656625,False,155,23,0.66176450252532959,0,True,False,False

But if you play without mods, the story is bad, EVERYITHING -all the weapons/worlds/missions/procedurally structures/races/enemies/ships/loot/armor- is all the exact same, few bosses are any good, many half-baked things like combat and NPCs and tech upgrades, the UI is horrible and the game lags a crap ton (when terraria doesn't while having more enemies and general stuff on-screen), and there are SO many pointless mechanics all fixed by mods, like slow crafting, loosing all loot, food expiring, many items not being on-handed, garbage damage scaling...

Only reason i'd play this over terraria is for the awesome exploration, for the mods (they completely carry the game), the beautiful spritework, the containers, those cool underwater cities, and because having a base in the galaxy is really cool.

Outside of that the game missed it's potential, which is really, really sad. I like it, and i like chucklefish, but It wants to be terraria so bad when it just doesn't have to be.

Hours Clocked: 583 (At time of Updated Review)

I'll say this from the start, I loved, well still love Terraria. That said, I also love Starbound but for different reasons. This isn't Terraria in space and there's places Terraria is better but like Starbound I'm left wanting more.

I have played Starbound from the beginning, so I've seen all the changes for the better and for the worse. Old Bosses, old survival mechanics and just a different path of progression. It was in a manner of speaking trying to *be* Terraria in Space and, it wasn't everything I'd hoped it would be.

I liked it then too mind you, it just seemed like it was having trouble being its own game. Many updates later, here we are a game that stands on its own, and even brings things I wish Terraria could have.

If you've played neither, you will find yourself with little more than a mining tool a broken sword and a ship that could use a little bit of a tune up. Over the course of the game, you'll make your ship bigger, get a crew (or not), make a colony or many colonies (or none at all) all while exploring planets for loot, ore and decorations.

The story was enjoyable, and will push you along the progression path. You can progress without the story, picking up story ""missions"" with an instance of a dungeon with a boss at the end. These are optional if you just want to progress to explore tougher planets if you'd prefer.

Each planet contains biomes and mini biomes that have their own perils, flora and fauna. Some will have villages of different races in the game, some will have hostile dungeons, and others just have little unique quirks. The downside is after a while you'll see some of the same things over again and depending on your RNG, it might be annoying to find yet another village of one race while wanting to find one of another.

Combat is simple, but fun. Lots of weapons to choose from ranging from a simple sword to magic staves. There's guns, rocket launchers, bows, pistols, shields and even whips. It should be simple enough to find a weapon to suit your style, though RNG again can be a pest when all you want is a new spear and you find a dagger for the 100th time.

Even with the RNG being a pest at times, the ability to change up what you're doing at any given time is nice. Maybe you find a planet you really like and decide to build a place for yourself, or maybe make your own colony. There's plenty of themes to build with, and colonists will match your decor for the most part. There's farming to go with lots of cooking recipes, livestock and even fishing. There's also creature collecting for use in combat if that's your thing.

If you're playing in survival, you'll need to eat and while you could just eat a simple crop like rice, you could make more complex dishes for various buffs as well. My only gripe is that you eat a bit more often than I think you should, but food is easy enough to come by so you'll rarely find yourself in a place without any means to feed your seemingly insatiable hunger.

I've put a lot of hours into co-op, and being able to travel quickly to friends across vast distances is simple. You can share coordinates with one another, but also make teleportation networks in addition to if you're in a party having the ability to direct teleport to them. This allows you to help them out on story missions, or they can drop in, join your group, and teleport over to join the activity right away. You've got direct connect as well as server options, and if you're so inclined, PvP can be a thing.

Overall my recommendation of Starbound is Recommended.

so yeah... the combat is basically i'm cheesing the enemies... or they're cheesing me.... i'm really glad i got this game on sale for 75% off.... the game isn't worth more than $5.... it is more fun when i'm playing with my family... but i wouldn't say the multiplayer is really all that accessible of a feature.... most of the online guides we found were about setting up a dedicated server which if you're not technically inclined is going to be out of reach for most people.... and the invite friends to play option we found has a lot of extra steps... and then requires you to invite your friends to your party via their typing their character name into a search field.. none of the other multiplayer games we've played are this tedious to just play together...

the building mechanic is nice once you get over the initial learning curve.... but so far the missions being purely combat focused have been basically unplayable. at least i'm playing on casual now so the broken combat (like the game lags really bad at times and like enemies will be attacking me and i'll be taking damage... but i have no control over my character... and i'm either still walking or like my attacks are lagging and will maybe happen in a few seconds)

like i'm finding all sorts of fancy weapons... but so far they're not enough to make the missions even remotely doable... i'm playing on casual and don't know that i'll ever buy anything with my pixels... so death is mostly meaningless.... but i'm still not sure if i'll ever be able to get through the missions... which means most of the game might be completely inaccessible... though if all that exists beyond the opening planet is just more boss fights and i've already found all the resources i need to build a neat looking house..... maybe the rest of the game just doesn't matter. this could still be a game to play when i'm just not feeling the much better survival crafting games i have actually completed.

the game really could use some basic key/button notifications. like i've had to look up ""how do i use x"" and it's ""right click"" but there's never any indication of what will happen when you right click on anything... so it's like right click to fly to a planet and you're on your way... but nothing in game tells you this... and in other places it actually does tell you which keys open different things. the shortcuts to select the mm tool functions are on the description of those tools...",1659984303,1660084304,False,3,0,0.49306371808052063,0,True,False,False

Starbound is probably and will almost certainly remain my favourite game of all time and it truly isnt even close. Saying the game is a masterpiece is simply wrong because it definitely isn't, but what makes it so good is its modding. I am going to be talking a lot about modding.

To start off with a completely vanilla copy of Starbound, if you bash only the main quest you can probably be done in 3-5 hours. If you take your time however, exploring all the different types of planets, making farms, doing all quests, making pets, building, making outposts (etc, etc) you will be looking at the same level of replayability as Terraria, complimented by the enormous universe. It is definitely worth playing for, and i highly recommend it.

But then you open the steam workshop for the first time..

I can say without a shadow of a doubt, there is not a single game that even comes close to how perfect the starbound modding ability. They provide you with tools to create anything using real programming languages with user-friendly syntax to let new people with enough patience still create something they love. It is the greatest feature in any game I have ever played. With around 2000 hours of being an active Modder, I would say I am probably one of the better modders in the whole Starbound modding community, and the creativity I can express to make things of all different visuals extents and uses is what has brought me back every single time i have a break. Not only this, but the modding in starbound introduced me to REAL programming, and my fluency in the chosen modding language ""Lua"" has helped me with Computer Science in school as well as other passion projects at home.
But becoming a modder is not the only good thing about the modding community, it is also the things available  to the public to experiment and have fun with. The extents that people go to add so much content it essentially creates a whole new starbound is insane, and with the megapacks of mods you find on the workshop, you will NEVER run out of things to do in this game. 

To briefly touch on music, the orchestral perfomances are beyond masterclass and capture perfectly the tone of the game that the Devs try to create. My current two favourite songs are ""On the beach at night"" and ""Planetarium"".

Extra info:

The multiplayer implementation is pretty good too. I recommend for anyone looking for a good server to start on, ""iLoveBacons"" is the most popular one. with a port of `7777` and an id of `sb.ilovebacons.com` ( no username and passwords required )

the best thing to do in this game is building because wow theres are a LOT of decoration items and A LOT of blocks. thats the only good thing about the game tbh, problem being im not creative enough to build... so maybe its just not my type of game

oh, i thought maybe it will give me a little satisfaction by completing achievements. ""destroyer of worlds"" is why i dont want to anymore, as if you dont want to spend 50 hours mining (probably no exegerated) you wont get this achievement without cheats (which is scummy). also theyre all hidden... alright ill search up a guide but any hidden achievement is so pointless its just annoying, achievements have no reason to be hidden, and here all of them are, ugh.",1659942526,1659942526,False,2,0,0.469014734029769897,0,True,False,False

I like this game. And i am going to give it a good review. 

Its fun and it has a really relaxing atmosphere that Terraria just doesnt have. If you just take the game as its own thing without comparing it to Terraria all the time it is IMO a fun game. 
Comparing the two games i think is like comparing Factorio and Satisfactory. They are similar in some aspects but are overall very different games with Terraria being more fast paced and difficult while Starbound is more relaxed.

I do agree however that the game is generally vastly inferior to Terraria, and i blame the lack of Updates. The Devs seem to have completely abandoned the game before it was fully realized and you can tell. It just feels really unfinished in certain areas like planet generation for example. Honestly, if this game would still get active updates it could possibly compete with Terraria.

Despite this however, i still think it can be quite fun, especially if you get some mods and invite some friends (unless you dont have any in which case tough luck), so i definetely recommend that you at least try it.

Oh yeah and it has a beautiful Soundtrack

There is a negative for almost every positive aspect of the game:
The game is huge, immense you will not see every planet every star... But why would u? They are all the same, auto-generated you seen one of each kind you saw all of that kind.
And you can stick with red stars cause they have all the resources you need. And the threat is (with a good armor ) the same as on small planets so why bother with the low threat planets?

You have loads to do: You can upgrade your ship, create colonies, space stations ... but in the end it feels a all the same and has very little purpose.

Well maybe you can farm create goods sell them for pixels. That you can than use to ... well except for some pets there is really nothing that much useful you can buy ... usually have to grind stuff yourself.

Quests: Kill, create, fetch... repeat. I guess that is usually the case but no decision making, no smart way of completing them no nothing.

Now let me tell you about the multiplayer - LAN, or run your own server. No simple client to client join online game etc. ... which for 21 century and such a simple game, is really bad.

Your saves are not backed up to cloud. You loose your local disk you start again unless you back them up yourself. And your saves can get corrupted. So you then have to google the internet and figure out how to retrieve your character from backup files on your disk. Why is there no feature in the game menu?

Cons:
- Fundamentally non-optimized. The game will always run on 2 cores and will not use your GPU, so the game WILL get laggy, no matter how beefy your computer is.
- A lot of incomplete ideas, mostly due to the unethical rotating-door of poorly paid interns that fueled the development of Starbound.
- Planets can be somewhat dull after your 5th or 6th one.
- Underground mining stinks.

But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
Don't play games, it'd be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt befo' ya
And love is evol, spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' ho's
Blood suckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin' to start over
I've got a hole in my heart for some kind of emotional roller coaster
Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250, 000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same?
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase
'Fore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break
And leave myself open that I won't be makin' a mistake
'Cause I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250, 000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I'll pour my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
Till I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't a possible reason I can think of
To let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this
And I would've did anything for you to show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you

""But what about the random generating planets and other randomized features in the game?"", I hear you say. And to be honest it still feels very samey. About each type of planet feels like it was taken from a blueprint, and just had some things changed around to make it ""a new planet."" The enemy variety is also slightly boring. Some enemies are too easy, while some are just too hard. Hell, the game even holds your hand and tells you what planets are the easy difficulty and which are the hard difficulty.

The only reason I like to come back to this game is because of the workshop content, the customization, and the building. The mods for this game can help spice up the game play a little bit, but in my opinion its just not enough. The customization and building part though is awesome. Being able to customize furniture in my ship, and being able to build what I want on the different planets is really neat. You can even have your own space station. 

Sadly its just not enough to keep me from tearing my eyes out from boredom while playing. If you're still interested, then go ahead and buy it. It's not that bad of a game. It's just that it gets really boring after a while.",1589846743,1658813951,False,0,0,0.419007569551467896,0,True,False,False

Edit(2022):
So Starbound, fantastic ost, very decent gameplay, overall progressions is good.

Stellaris is both an amazing sandbox and a hollow experiance. The game has issues, progression from beta to what it is now has changed so much that its honestly a different game at this point. The game controls really well, the bosses are decent at best, and there is a lot to do. 

Story: The game used to be that you were just some random person out in space with a damaged ship, now you are given a backstory as a someone who comes from earth to find away to protect the universe from some evil. Which honestly isn't to bad but I kinda wish they had kept the ""you are nobody"" angle, being trapped in space allows the player to have more control over who their character was and it kinda makes the game railroady as you are now hampered by the backstory.

To add on the more you play the story the more you encounter cultists and Lovecraftian horrors but the game never tries to explain who they are outside of a ""they are some ancient evil"", its just kinda ridiculous.

Gameplay: The gameplay is actually some of the better parts of this game, the loop is pretty much, dig into the ground and get as much ore as you can, make workbenches, do quest to progress the story so you can go to newer planets. Mining is fun, combat is pretty decent compared to other games like starbound. The bigger issues i have with starbounds gameplay as it stands is that i removed everything that made it unique. the game used to have a dynamic hot and cold system that was pretty much determined by your armor, the time of day, how high you were, and how much heat is being outputted next to you. Now its if you have this heat pack on your back the cold planets are completely transverable. Survival mechanics in general kinda got taken out of the game outside of farming and eating (although i would argue you get hungry way to fast). To even be able to experience hunger you have to play on survival difficulty or higher as apparently those who play casually and don't want to have item drop on death are just not allowed to be able to have the survival mechanics. I could go on about a lot of things but mods exist and players have already fixed most of my issues. Still salty about dynamic heat.

Modding: As stated before this game is a sandbox and oh boi does it show. By far the best portion of the game is modding it. This game has a steam workshop, a website modlist, and several other places where you can browse, download, and install a bunch of content to the game. Don't like the story of the game? BAM you just removed it, want more content in general? Frakin Universe adds so much to the game (although a lot of it kinda just baggage and extends to the point where i need a legit storage room.) You can change any aspect of the game and more than likly you will find people who have added more to the game than the devs will.

Overall: So do i like this game? Yes i very much do. Do i Recommend it? Yes, it is still one of the better sandbox survivals out there and even when you get bored you can find content to add your game to make it better.",1388116657,1658420413,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The community adds mods to add more fun into the game, Galaxy in Conflict, Frackin' Universe, a Subnautica mod, Project Knightfall essentially fun mods just to play around with.

The only issue is that the game is very difficult to mod if you're not experienced in Starbound modding as I am, as these mods sometimes don't have compatibility with other mods so if you want to go into that league, I recommend that you read the descriptions of most mod pages if they are compatible with other mods from other creators.

But overall if you don't want to see those issues, try out Vanilla first. Or you could subscribe to ""An Overly Complex Assortment of Mods"" which has a grand total of 10GB, but I'm not expecting for it to work for some people buttery smooth as it did for me.

Don't get me wrong you do need some level of skill to truly play well, that limit is not as high as other games. Monsters and enemies have relatively simple mechanics for games (excluding bosses). However, I found that combat and mobs were not the main point of this game. Completing the story is fun, but base-building/ship-building, playing on servers, and, most importantly, mods really add much more to the game while making it fun and enjoyable.

Ingredients:

2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Overall fun most people will call it a Terrarria clone, when you start you will starve a lot until you figure out how farming works, it has quite a weird progression locking you to 1 planet until you can repair your ship essentially having to ""complete"" your starting planet before being able to reach the ark where from there you're able to do much more

Wall jump, spin dash and air dash tech cards allow you the maximum amount of movement possible being able to climb vertical walls and go extremely fast when exploring planets and the wall jump giving you the ability to double jump and jump off of walls/cling

The Hylotls structures are Japanese style which for me being a massive weeb enjoys a lot and I spent around 12 hrs of my total playtime building a massive fucking temple where my starting house used to be although I wasn't able to think of ways to decorate it cause the amount of items i was dumping into chests without a dedicated storage area

Never really messed with the ""Redstone"" mechanics of the game which could've been interesting nor have I tried making colonies

The progression system actually makes sense if you want to explore other planets requiring you to mine in hostile territory for ores to survive more dangerous planets

The mods for this game is whack [strike] especially the sex mods [/strike] fracking universe being literally a overall of the entire games progression system that feels entirely different from the base game and the kawaii stuff mod allowing your character to look more appealing with more cosmetics as well

I didn't play the game for the story

Hostile enemies literally cant hit you with projectiles if you crouch

Fall damage is the literal worst thing in this game, you accelerate so fast its hard to react to anything and you have no air control with the added feature that your character can slip because you accidentally moved a tiny bit too much its like the floor is made of ice

The weapons and armor are very mmo like having a dedicated armor set for the specific weapon choice you want (ranger being the best because of the energy bar being the most used thing you'll be using)

No dedicated sorting system so everything is as whack as Minecraft chests, not to mention the storage units are way too small for even the bigger ones which take way too much space, its like you're forced to make a planet dedicated to just storage even if you can make your own space station

Worth noting this game runs like dog shit on integrated graphics but there is a button to shift the camera so you can actually see in front of you without having to sacrifice visibility for frames. There is mods to reduce lag but that should not be a thing in general for a fucking 2D game

I was looking for something to sort of scratch that Stardew Valley itch but with a little more on the action side of things, and this game absolutely delivers on that front. The loot is procedural so you never really know what you're gonna find in that next container, and the weapons are incredibly varied from assault rifles and shotguns, to swords and magic wands, some coming with secondary firing modes that do some awesome stuff. I've also found ""unique"" weapons that are always something totally different and, well, unique, like an eyeball that shoots out worm-like tentacles. The combat in this game feels really good, though slightly clunky due to having to use keyboard and mouse. I tried using a bluetooth controller and someone's recommended controller layout, but it still didn't feel right, but as I've used the M&K more and more, I actually prefer it, even if it's still not the most intuitive control scheme.

Beyond the combat, the game has a very nice progression and reward loop. You craft better gear to allow you to explore more hostile planets, so you can mine better ore and build better equipment. The nice thing is you can also find civilizations on planets that will already have really strong gear, but you have to decide if it's worth the risk trying to find them while you're relatively weak to the local wildlife (or bounty hunters). A lot of the game is centered around mining, crafting, and farming. Farming gets easier with time as you upgrade your ship and have more space to put crops and you'll get things like sprinklers to help automate the watering process. It's satisfying in the same way that Stardew Valley felt, but I think I like it even more because there's soooo many items to collect and craft, so crops aren't simply for making money and serve an actual purpose in crafting.

The story is okay. It's very repetitive with you essentially being told to collect 6 artifacts from each major race which means a rather tedious mission of finding that specific race for the mission and ""scanning"" nearly everything in their villages or dungeons (sometimes you don't find enough stuff in a single village or dungeon, so you have to keep searching for more) then you are tasked with completing a unique instanced dungeon that ends with a boss battle. They're pretty easy though a nice change of pace from the normal loop of planet exploration and mining. 

The game has some nice progression and RPG mechanics, like being able to get Metroid-like upgrades for your gear that give you permanent passive bonuses, like being able to mine faster, turn yourself into a morph ball, and even give yourself a double or triple jump. These upgrades feel really good when you unlock them and make exploration that much more rewarding.

There's still so much I didn't touch on, like the Mech gameplay (also with it's own upgrades to earn and unlock), pets/minions, base-building, tenants that can offer protection or be merchants... there's just a surprising amount of depth here, but the real star of the show is the procedural generation, which will constantly surprise you with epic loot, cool biomes, and things like underground lost civilizations that you stumble upon while just digging straight down for awhile... pretty amazing what they did here. 

I did start using some mods around level 20 as there's certain things that I really wanted, like a mode that had hunger but didn't have you drop all your items when you die. You keep your equipment (something I think they didn't do in beta, which sounds awful), but if you were mining for 30 minutes and got a ton of ore, and died, you have to hope you can find your way back to your body because all of your items got dropped where you died, and after a few hours of having this happen over and over again, and not being able to retrieve my body, I just decided to add a mod to turn off the lost items penalty. I wish they would have added this option when starting a game because you either go easy mode, which turns off hunger and death penalty altogether, or you do normal mode, which has the item loss, which was just a little too much for me to bear. Perhaps on my next playthrough I'll try normal without the mod, but given that the keyboard controls are kind of clunky, I think this is a happy medium of being challenging without being frustrating.

The soundtrack for this game is PHENOMENAL! Probably one of the best I've ever heard, mostly because it fits absolutely perfectly with the vibe of the game... the music is super deep and ambient when you're traversing most organic planets, then gets a little darker when in the deeper biomes and is upbeat and tense when you're doing dungeons or high-action missions. A lot of devs (and gamers) seem to overlook music or put the least amount of effort into it, but Chris Schweitzer is a talented composer and I'm super glad Chucklefish brought him on to make this soundtracks because it is just sublime and brings this already amazing game to another level.


Anyways, give the game a shot, and once you feel like you've started burning out, consider trying the Frackin Universe (FU) mod. I haven't tried it yet, but it's all I ever see people talking about on Starbound forums, so I'm excited to try it out once the game starts to bore me, but it's still going strong for now. Sad to hear Chucklefish dropped support. The game has a lot of potential and wish they kept with it but I still think it's a stellar game.",1657927083,1657927379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Extremely parasitic devs. If you want more info on this look it up, I'm not mentioning it much because my review may be marked as off-topic for just mentioning this, but this should 100% be taken into account before buying.
- Horrendous story that gets in the way of sandboxing in a sandbox game.
- The fact that it is LITERALLY Starbound.
- It is literally just not good.
- Has all the same issues as No Man's Sky at launch, but amplified due to lackluster base-building and the atmosphere is worse, you don't feel ""Starbound"" in this like you do in NMS (again, at launch) basically NMS but in 2D form. For some reason unlike NMS at launch, this has ""Very Positive"" and not ""Mostly Negative"".
- All mechanics are either watered down versions of Terraria's or just different to try and make you not think this is a Terraria copy, but it ends up being more tedious to use.
- Extremely uninteresting enemies and bosses after you fight 1 or 2.
- Everything which is not blatantly hand-crafted has mediocre at best repetitive generation.
- There's hundreds of other issues I have not mentioned states in other reviews of this game.

- Because your ship is basically your home, you really just need one world to grow food on and can explore the rest of 'em with no cares

- Though a lot of the food growing process still needs to be done manually, you can somewhat automate the watering of plants early game by exclusively using tall plants, and having a thin layer of water at the base.

- You basically always have your trusty matter manipulator, so the standard tools you see in this game (aside from weapons) just give you a boost

- Speaking of the weapons, fancy ones look to be auto-generated, giving nice rewards. They also work nice for the point in the game you would find them at.

- The bosses are really fun

- Plenty of character mods to add funky races to the game, to the point that a major made up species (Avali) looks to have gotten popular by this.

The playable races are very unique and distinct, with some charming Florans even cosplaying as mushroom people that sell quiche. The story holds some cool rewards and it introduces you to the various cultures, with dungeons and boss fights to boot..

Honestly where the game shines is getting lost in a random hole in the ground, or while building your dream mansions, because the tile and clothing variety is just that good.

The random quests you get from villagers (pre-existing or your own) range from charming (growing plants, exchanging gifts) to dangerous with long walking distances (bandit hunts, rescuing villagers).. They do get repetetive. Same thing with the last expansion, the bounty hunting DLC. It was fun for 2 loops in one playthrough, then it got rather stale. The same goes for the previous mech combat addon. It was a very cool idea. But the inclusion into the main game is just.. not quite there.

For repeat playthroughs a lot of mods exist, ranging from custom furniture, races and quality of life patches.

The fact that settlers will attack you if you pick up blocks that belong to them, and the fact they live on a volcano planet that burned their entire goddamn settlement to the floor is never a factor that's registered in that. Or that ""Oh boy, cool mechs!"" just ends up being boring with how slow and clunky they are?

I COULD go into detail about that or just.. mention that chucklefish was accused of exploiting and abusing dozens of people (or more) who contributed to this game. 
Given that, I'm not surprised that thi sgame turned out the way it did. Power to the people who still want to make it a decent thing, but I ain't playing it again with that knowledge (nor do I intend to buy further chucklefish products.)

The fact that it has an amazing and dedicated modding community makes it ten times better. For an early access game, I'd say it's worth every cent I spent on it.

I personally enjoy it because of the aesthetic and weapons, but i understand how many find this game lacking. They are not wrong, this game could be improved upon for sure, its just something about being able to plant my flag on any planet and any environment i want with no real limit to how much space i have, no world border and decently sized planets (it just loops around) and if i run out of space i just go to another planet that gives me the freedom as if i was a real person colonizing space.

They could improve the quests because they tend to get very redundant/annoying; I feel that the story objectives get in the way of enjoyment of the game, hindering me from exploring on my own and sort of forcing me on this linear path

and I would prefer shuttles instead of mechs and the guns on the players ship to not be just for looks (but that is just a stylistic choice, not game-breaking)

In fact, this game has virtually no replay-ability besides bland structures and planets that barely reward the player for exploring.

The combat - garbage: monsters damage you if they touch you, and on top of that they'll have random attacks. Nothing is balanced, when you first start day one blobs will kill you in two hits, and you lose 10% of your money when you die.

The itemisation - garbage: The whole time I've played chests always contain the same 3 or 4 items. Sometimes you'll get an upgrade chip, but mostly you'll just get some plant fibres, a salve or two, and some hunting spears.

Equipment - garbage: You've only got a handful of equipment slots and none of the equipment you get seems to actually increase your offensive/defensive capabilities.

Character progression - garbage: You can improve your ability to dig soil faster, but that's about it.

Graphics - garbage: Seems redundant to say, but lordy. It reminds me of Commander Keen.

Sound - garbage: At one point I had to actually pause the game and turn off my speakers and I could swear I could hear a car alarm going off, but no it was the game. Plus there are no audible notifications for anything useful, like for instance a low health warning.

So if outside factors like that affect your decision then this if a FYI. Second, my game is [b] HEAVILY MODDED [/b] so my review might misremember or misattribute features as from a mod when its actual from the base game. 

Starting with the main/side quests and story:

The main quest is incredibly short with a handful of handmade quests with their own. SPOILERS for a short summary of the quest line/ story, though it's not much [spoiler] After the intro mission, its another 7 missions with one being handmade and the other six being a collection/ search mission where you find (actually random) artifacts, then go do a hand made level. After the six, you then go to a somewhat randomly generated final level dig deep and kill the two bosses: The end. That is the whole game. [/spoiler] Despite the main quest, the lore (If you care for it) is fairly expansive for what it should be, each species having their own lore from the Aztec warrior Avians to the Oppressive Apex government fighting against rebels. All of it is told via letters, books, NPCs, and buildings/ levels that you find throughout the game. I do wish however you could influence these events. Maybe seeing Avians praying to their god in a circle or Apex rebels fighting government agents on a random world. At most you'll find a rebel camp or avian tomb that you could visit but that's it.

Characters have... character. I honestly felt more attached to the NPCs in Terraria then I did with any in this game. Other than the side protagonists it's all randomly generated Tenants and crew members, which without mods were mostly annoying with crew members standing in front of crafting stations. Ironically the tenant system is a bit more in-depth in comparison with the Crews, as tenants come in different unique clothing and quests (though its still all randomly generated) and guards with their own variation coming in different looks. Admittedly i didn't delve too much into it as with BYOS I had those tenants on my own ship rather than on a planet and I didn't see any quests offered by them (again this was on my own ship using Frackin Universe's BYOS feature). 

Soundtrack was pretty decent, I enjoyed the orchestral parts music that fits your environment, though maybe it's because I'm a sucker for that type of music. Another thing to mention is that the game has six hours of the OST... which is... very impressive, as most indie games I've seen have around an hour or maybe two of music, this game's six hours is on another level.

A good 80% of the game is randomly generated, planets, enemies, structures, biomes, characters, weapons, etc. Which to me is awful. I would have preferred 15 or 20 handmade planets with 30 or so Randomly generated planets. The handmade being homeworlds like Earth or places where resources are guaranteed to spawn. Not the 12 Quadrillion planets that I've heard, which is strange because you really need around 9 planets to finish the game .The universe is apparently persistent among characters, with a simple need of the coordinates to see where your other character is located.  I've tried to reach a planet with a pre-made base I made with my first character with a newer character, only for the map to move so far away that it would have taken 999999 fuel to actually reach. And the camera moved to quickly that I wouldn't have been able to even chart a course over to my old base. 

A major gripe I have is how the game NEEDS mods to be good. I've seen a lot of people in different games attribute mods to being part of the original game and so because they tailored their game to their own likes, the game itself is good. Which I disagree, if a game needs mods to be good then it isn't a good game. But mods like Frackin Universe add features that I feel like should have been part of the original game such as... BEING ABLE TO BUILD YOUR OWN SHIP. Which is a massive oversight on Chuklefish which should have been in the game already. FU brings in the research tree, different weapons, abilites, etc. which makes the game so much better than what it was. Although I do think the people do really enjoy the game without mods, I just didn't really think the game could hold without mods and needs them to even be playable for any amount of time. 

Overall, I'll say what I saw a few other reviewers said: it's a Space Furry Terraria, and just go play Terraria. Starbound improves/ adds a lot more stuff that Terraria didn't have like vehicles (not mentioning the railcart) or body tech that allows you to double jump, turn into a samus morph sphere, and dash/ sprint without using enhanced boots or other armor. Even then, Terraria can be modded with its recent updates. And I think that kinda says for itself: Terraria, after nine years is still getting updates with a few years ago getting its last big update, and Chucklefish seemingly abandoned this game. This game was more of a cash grab riding on the back of the Terraria train, using unpaid young developers, random generated content, and advertising mods as being part of the game to make as much cash as possible. When the river dried up, they dropped the game and moved on to other games. Though I realize thats a bit harsh, I'm certain some of the devs or the composers and musicians for the OST really did put their heart into this game. Which makes me feel a bit guilty for giving this game a negative review and wish that there was a mixed recommendation option available.

If you don't mind heavily modding the game (It's been very stable for me, with only two or so crashes in the past 560 hours of me playing) or the heavy randomization that the game relies on then It could be a game for you. But the only fun I found through those 560 hours was with the FU mod and building my own ship while mining the new worlds added by mods and going through the FU research tree. So basically I found the FU mod fun, not the game itself.",1657172873,1657173537,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Though for me I don't find the value of the game in those aspects, I find them in the limitless potential for building, and finally, THE MODS.

WHERE DO I START. Think of the mods as like the mods for Bethesda games. There are endless mods to check out, which gives you endless things to do. Mods that make the story more interesting, mods that flat out remove the story, race mods (hundreds no joke), vehicle mods, planet mods, star mods, ship mods, and so SO much more. That's how I get all my playtime out of the game. Though, and I am not kidding, I know of someone who has over 42,000 hours in the game, as they mod it a lot. Not sure how I can prove it but you'll just have to take my word. And that goes to show, if you're creative and want to mod Starbound (which is very easy by design), you can get literally endless value out of the game.

I did not play Starbound the way it was meant to be played. I used console commands and all sorts of mods, and I've not bothered with most of the fights. Mostly because that's not what I play this game for. Sure, there are cool abilities, especially modded ones, challenging bosses, but that's more the Terraria experience. Not my thing.

Graphics wise, though, Starbound probably satisfies a different niche from Terraria. More colorful, more pastel, which brings me to what I play this game for.

This game is great if you want to simply build a cozy pixel base with all sorts of contraptions and wiring justified by the scifi setting, ranging from pastel backgrounds, meadows, post-apocalyptic worlds, and much more. Even more if you factor in the Workshop.

This game is great to play with a friend, building things together in creative mode. 

Much and more time though, is taken finding a planet you actually like. There are options to manually bruteforce things, but they are limited.

To begin, the positives are that its a game in which two playthroughs will never be the exact same, given that the universe you spawn into is procedurally generated, as well as every planet. This occasionally made loading times a little long, but it wasn't much of a problem. The universe is also superficially well fleshed out: collectable books add lore, NPCs of different races talk about their race (not in much depth, however) and other races. There's a fossil for most vanilla playable races (not novakid) and NPC races like the agaran, a moth collection, fish collection, etc. The characters you are introduced to are varied, [spoiler] Some, like Nuru and Koichi, are interesting and make sense as to why they join you at the ruins, while Lana doesn't seem to have a good reason to stay at the ruins with you, not while she's a rebel leader, and Esther...Isn't compelling, and has the personality of a boiled chicken leg mixed with your standard 'nice grandma' figure. [/spoiler]

However, despite having all of that in this game, very little of it is actually used in the main storyline. The story consists of talk to Esther, find a dungeon, scan some furniture, go to a larger, premade dungeon, fight a boss, get a thing, repeat. Also, to have even the slightest chance in the dungeons, you need to go underground and get metals to make armour and weapons. And while the underground layers of a planet are interesting in the sense that they also have mini dungeons and biomes, considering the amount of time the player will spend in them, they're pretty lacklustre. And none of the collection elements, like the codexes, fossils, or pets, are used to progress the main story. Which feels like a missed opportunity. If the game didn't hold your hand up until you find Esther, and continue to hold your hand once you decide to go on with the main story (which is optional, but will constantly have a quest marker telling you where to go), there are so many different ways you could have ended up finding out about the main bad guy, and the artifacts which lead you to them. The bosses are pretty good for their difficulty, and have varied attacks, even if the missions to get to them are the same.

After the first playthrough, go to the workshop and download some mods. They improve the gameplay by so much after one playthrough.

I kept Googling whether the game had x and y, but the answer always came back as a no. 

Overall this was such an annoying experience I don't think I'll go back to it.

Like Terraria, it can be a little difficult to figure out the different game mechanics, so I'd recommend reading a few beginners guides first.  That helped me get past the first boss and start happily building my colony. Also, I recommend not installing mods until you've played the vanilla game for a while and get a good feel for it. 

Overall, great game play, good music, the grenade launcher delights me to no end (* pomf! BOOM! *) and the building options are fantastic. Every bit of world material can be used as a background/foreground texture for building houses, so deconstruct everything that's not in an NPC town (guards will eventually attack and kill you if you start ripping and tearing apart villages). You can even remodel your ship if you so desire! 

Also, NPCs will not move into your house unless you invite them to! Plus, what you place in the room determines what race and type of NPC moves in. BTW,  Florans and Avians are the best races to play because they are so. darn. cute!!! And stabby.  I loves the stabby. :P

you have choices, you can take multiple paths to do nearly the same things

trying to find lost treasures, hidden creatures, and talking or spitting words at other living beings
combat and challenge made up for by being a forgiving yet utterly hostile interaction

build giant pillars of grandeur for your own amusement

I have a lot of complains with the game here in there;  mostly the lack of content but I always felt at home playing this game .

it's a relaxing journey of mining, going in circles around a planet, admiring the pixel art and vibing with the sound track and sometimes it's really stressful cause many a times you'll get too greedy and die in a cave and loose all your items.

If anything to consider whether buying this game is that if you enjoy building and looking for interesting stuff , it's a good game 

But if you want to be satisfied and want a good story this ain't the one get.

All in all it's worth checking out especially during sales cause it really cheap and I think it's a really good first game you could buy in steam.

Even on the lowest difficulty setting, it lacks the relaxing feel of Terraria.  And it seems that you can generate a new map that doesn't have the resources to keep your character alive on survival mode. Just started another new game, and can't seem to find any ore.  Without ore, I cant' craft a hoe, so I can't plant crops, and thus my character will probably starve to death (again.)  
Combat is also very dependent on player skill and learning the behavior of enemies. (If you like this type of game, then you may enjoy Starbound.) Terraria combat is more focused on DPS and armor, although the boss battles do require skill.
In conclusion, I'm not saying that this is a bad game or don't buy it.  Just giving my opinion so folks can judge for themselves.",1656344072,1656344072,False,0,0,0.425531923770904541,0,True,False,False

In the earlier versions, I thought the game was more fun. Now it just feels very tedious to advance... and even after you've advanced, the payoff just doesn't feel worth it. I would say the focus of the game is to adventure and build, but I like enjoying a good story between my building ventures.

In its current state, I don't play the game much. I played it all the time in earlier builds, but yeah... not really a fan of the current version of the game. It's worth trying out if space adventure games like this appeal to you, but you can easily save your money and give this game a pass if you had any doubts.",1656342128,1656342128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its extremely enjoyable and a easy recommend to anyone interesting in games similar to terraria in game-play, assuming you don't mind the more scifi aesethics to the more fantasy ones of Terarria. Comparing games is good way to easily describe them but this game is a completely different experience than Terarria and should be judged separately. That being said, yes i do think its worth the relatively cheap asking price. It frequently goes on sale for under 6 dollars and for that price its a absolute steal. Full price being 15 dollars is not asking for much either with the vast content the game offers, and the enjoyable minute to minute game-play.",1656333606,1656333606,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat in my opinion is the weakest aspect of this game since it usually devolves into repeatedly clicking over and over until the thing you're fighting against ends up dead. The final boss especially suffered from this problem in my playthrough. I managed to slay the thing by duel-wielding axes and hitting it over and over until the ending cutscene played through.

That said, I would still highly recommend this title if you're more concerned with exploration and building. The game possesses a very beautiful pixel art style which really works to create unique environments and biomes that add a lot of flavor and personality into each world you explore. The building system certainly compliments the art style since the game hands you hundreds of different block types of different themes that you can mix and match to build whatever you want. 

To me, the gameplay loop here mostly consisted of going from planet to planet to find building blocks, followed by finding resources to go onto other planets to then take their blocks. If this sounds like something fun to you, then by all means I would encourage you to try it out. I personally found it to be fun for what it was worth. 

Just let me reiterate one more time, do NOT go into this game thinking it will be space Terraria, because that's not what this game is nor is it what it was trying to be.

One more thing that is important to mention. This game has garnered quite an infamous reputation for all of the exploitation and harassment that happened during its development period. I seriously cannot recommend supporting Chucklefish in any way and I only recommend this game out of its own merit and not from its developers. If you really want to play this, I would recommend finding some way to try it out without directly supporting the company and their asinine practices.",1656309536,1656309536,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

ORIGINAL REVIEW (NEGATIVE):

This game is a lot of fun, but without modding, there is not a lot of unique content. 

The main reason for the negative review is because the game is extremely poorly optimized and I feel this will probably not change. It drops frames all the time and often crashes, even crashing other programs along with it. Certain objects in the world cause more of this, but even when there is nothing of note, it still freezes all the time. It is borderline unplayable, but the progression is satisfying while it lasts.

The way this game runs makes me beg to go back to factorio because holy hell i need that smoothness back in my life.",1655799414,1655800039,False,5,0,0.504587173461914063,0,True,False,False

Reseña en Español:

Starbound es un juego fenomenal, único en su tipo, es un juego de exploración espacial, que tiene muchas cosas geniales, tiene coleccionismo de items, bestiario, poder viajar a otros planetas con tu nave, expandir tu nave espacial, bosses, monstruos generados de manera procedural y algunos otros que son fijos, puedes vivir en ella incluso, crear colonias espaciales, historia, tiene de todo en verdad, es un juego muy adictivo y su banda sonora es hermosa, aunque eso sí, no tiene traducción al español de manera oficial, pero no es un inconveniente ya que hay un mod que te permite traducirlo casi en su totalidad, dicho mod lo encuentras en la workshop.

De igual manera el juego tiene una gran infinidad de mods que hacen que el juego se expanda aún más en cuanto a contenido, uno de ellos es el Frackin Universe que es prácticamente Starbound 2, sería el equivalente al Calamity Mod si hablamos de Terraria.

Starbound se parece a Terraria en varias de sus mecánicas y sprites, pero tiene mucho contenido enfocado al espacio y mecánicas totalmente nuevas, así que no se dejen engañar ambos son unos juegazos, lo malo de Starbound, es que a lo largo de los años ha sido abandonado por sus desarrolladores, y de hecho, intenté twittearles a los de Chucklefish que hicieran el juego de código abierto pero me bloquearon de su twitter, así que el juego ya no recibe actualizaciones, pero aún así, la comunidad sigue manteniéndolo a través de los mods, aunque es una pena, ya que el juego tiene muchisimo potencial que explotar, y quien sabe que depare el futuro, quizás algún día los desarrolladores se den cuenta de esta joya y vuelvan a actualizarlo, este juego vale totalmente la pena aunque su compañía de desarrollo no lo apoye, vale cada dolar, siempre tendrás cosas que hacer, desde jugar con tus amigos hasta jugar en singleplayer, de igual manera tiene soporte de servidores tanto de steam como externos.

Y bueno, disculpen por este testamento, pero tenía ganas de reseñar uno de mis juegos favoritos de Steam <3

English Review:

Starbound is a phenomenal game, unique in its kind, it is a space exploration game, which has many great things, it has item collecting, bestiary, being able to travel to other planets with your ship, expand your spaceship, bosses, monsters generated from procedural way and some others that are fixed, you can even live in it, create space colonies, history, it really has everything, it is a very addictive game and its soundtrack is beautiful, although yes, it does not have a translation into Spanish in a way official, but it is not an inconvenience since there is a mod that allows you to translate it almost in its entirety, you can find this mod in the workshop.

In the same way, the game has a great infinity of mods that make the game expand even more in terms of content, one of them is the Frackin Universe that is practically Starbound 2, it would be the equivalent of the Calamity Mod if we talk about Terraria.

Starbound resembles Terraria in several of its mechanics and sprites, but it has a lot of content focused on space and totally new mechanics, so don't be fooled, both are great games, the bad thing about Starbound is that over the years it has been abandoned by it's devs, and in fact i tried to tweet to chucklefish to make the game open source but i got banned from their twitter so the game doesn't get any updates anymore but still the community keeps supporting it via the mods, although it is a pity, since the game has a lot of potential to exploit, and who knows what the future holds, maybe one day the developers will realize this gem and update it again, this game is totally worth it although its development company does not support it, it is worth every dollar, you will always have things to do, from playing with your friends to playing in singleplayer, in the same way it has support from both steam and external servers.

And well, sorry for this testament, but I wanted to review one of my favorite Steam games <3

As a long time player of starbound I gotta say I’m very disappointed with the official release of this game. As it stands it isn’t a terrible product but it’s a very sloppy one that basically requires mods in order to both work properly, feel unique, and smooth out this games very rough edges. Starbound has a great idea but it squanders it due to trying to be too many things at once, it suffers from floaty controls, a clunky UI, a half baked shoehorned story, and misses a lot of wonderful opportunities. (For instance there are a multitude of races, but they are 90% cosmetic, would’ve been pretty cool if they had some bonuses to make them a bit more unique.) this game would’ve been wonderful if they removed the primary story and instead focused on building up their infinite galaxy with some unique factions to join, maybe even add in some RPG elements as well, but instead we get what feels like a half ***ed terraria that completely misses the point. Because of this I sadly cannot recommend starbound simply because there are better 100% finished products out there that don’t require mods in order to have a good time.",1551076406,1655788192,False,4,0,0.517717838287353516,0,True,False,False

Go play Terraria if you haven't, it's a REALLY good game (If you can only buy this or Terraria, buy Terraria).  No, this is not 2D space Minecraft, although it's more similar to that than it is to Terraria. During this review, I will compare this game to both Minecraft and Terraria, but that doesn't mean this game is just a clone of those.

This game has a slow pace similar to Minecraft, in which you gradually work your way across the surface of a planet, and gradually travel deeper through caves. In this game's gameplay loop, you must:
-Mine the planet's new tier of ore to upgrade your armor
-Scan for clues from structures on the surface
And optionally, you may:
-Do space missions to upgrade your mech
-Progress several varieties of side quests
-Upgrade your mining abilities, movement, and spaceship
This repeats about 6 times during the game. With so many things to do each cycle, if you get bored with one aspect, you can always just switch to progressing something else, so the game stays interesting

This game does have a class based combat, with melee, ranger, and mage classes. However, class based armor only appears around the latter portion of the game, giving you ample time to get a feel for things first. Weapons are randomly generated from a somewhat limited but still decent variety of types, elements, and abilities. Additionally, there are unique weapons with strange or interesting mechanics.

Now for one of my favorite parts of the game, the atmosphere. With earth destroyed and humanity scattered to space, you spend a lot of time slowly drifting from planet to planet, taking things slowly. There's no rush, and you'll never encounter a challenge when you're just trying to chill. The soundtrack is AMAZING and really complements the slow, laid back feel of the game.

Overall, this game is great. I'm on my second playthrough right now, with a few light mods. If it's your first time, I recommend either playing vanilla, or playing with a few quality of life mods, or the Avali race mod. (Avalis were intended to be in vanilla but were cut due to copyright issues) td;lr don't play frackin universe your first time through.

Since they added much more content it has been an amazing game, where I can lose hours just exploring the planets of one system and collect amazing stuff. I usually play on casual, mostly because I just prefer exploring without the fear of losing everything and worrying about hunger.

Pros:
- Great unique biomes/Amazing visuals.
- Good mechanics that work fluently with me.
- Great backstory with unique races to choose from.
- Fun ways to build yourself a nice base/ship
- Charming 2D Grafics
- Great multiplayer which can make the game more fun to play. (Except when you have a maniac like me.)
Cons:
- Can be hard at times to figure out
- Some of the main missions are quite unforgiving and you will die alot unprepared.
- Figuring out how to get your ship running so you can leave the system. (This is a personal opinion...I'm quite the moron in figuring those things out,
- Having Q set as the default Throw button had me panic several times over throwing away my weapon during a difficult fight.

Note that I made the game potentially harder for myself as I installed two Mods called Fracking Universe and Arcana Worlds, that added even more to the game. Overall...this game had me lose several times of my life due to its grafics and sheer vast choice in terms of planets and races. If you like sandbox games that contain visiting other planets, a bunch of mobs that may whoop your butt and you have a thing for 2D grafics, this is definitely something for you.

You can also use torches to show the way you traveled as you go down to make this easier.

Most of those hours were in the pre-release version of the game, which while buggy and unpolished, had an incredibly more satisfying gameplay loop, focused on mining and equipment upgrades. The current version of the game replies almost exclusively on long, boring, excruciatingly unskippable quests that are designed to stretch your patience and attention span to their absolute limits. There's also the issue of the devs *removing vast amounts of content from the game* in the transition from beta to release.

The story of the released game, much hyped by Chucklefish, turns out to be incredibly drawn-out and simplistic. Earth has been destroyed! An interesting prospect, right? Wouldn't any responsible storyteller do anything to explore this unusual setting? No, all we're asked to do is to stop some nefarious individual from using that same force of destruction on aliens because... uh, well, the person in question does not like aliens, I guess.

Pros: 
-Infintite universe sandbox (If your pc can handle it)
-Great mod support and mods
-Not complicated (I caught on fairly quick so I don’t speak for everyone)
-Endless replayability (mods take it to next level)

Cons:
-Crashes sometimes (Probably just me since I have a really old pc)
-Although the universe is infinite some star-systems/planets tend to become repetitive (Solely based if going for unmodded expierence, mods expand the variety of planets and stuff so I recommend you check some out)


Verdict: Overall good game, I bought it when the infamous exploit was found, but didn’t abuse it since I’m not thirsty for steam levels. This has probably been said a lot but it’s similarity to Terraria drove me to it and I liked it more than Terraria. The whole exploring space thing really caught my eye and I just had to buy it. So if you enjoyed Terraria and want something even more fun then this game is for you. Looking forward for the next big update! 

Score: 9/10 Epic and cool
