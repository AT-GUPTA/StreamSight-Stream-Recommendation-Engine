- The only reason I bought this game was that I did not own any NBA2K games prior and I desperately wanted to play test it, luckily only for 30$, anything more than that, I'll better off selling my PC and buying a PS5 or XBOX
- Realism, motion capture on A+
- Controller- Friendly.
- Plain, mediocre but non offensive story plot line .


[h1] Minus : [/h1] 

- Go and browse through other reviews and you'll know why it's 'not recommended' 
- Micro-transactions, the online feature of this game relies HEAVILY on micro-transactions from skins to skills upgrade
- Hackers, since there's no sort of VAC related stuff going on, you'll probably gonna see a game that's out for 2 weeks but you'll encounter a 99 overall 5'10 Chinese Lebron James full with swappable skins while riding in a scooter
- MyTeam AKA FUT Team in FIFA, another fast cash-milking machine developed by NBA2K, essentially what it does is you'll need high-rated players to against other high-rated players. I'll dumb it down by saying it's like a Pokemon Trading Card Game where you'll just need a Charizard VS another player who has Blasttoise. 
- Game mechanics not as polished as FIFA, play FIFA then you'll know player movements/ reactions / timings
- Feeling shot timing inconsistency when you're playing the online feature ? Well, good news, it's a regional based server thing, it's the problem with NBA2K servers. Managed to test it out by playing with friends from other regions and they all said the same thing, it's the thing with NBA2K servers and they felt the shot timing was off as well, not responsive and as through there were some minor ping issues
- NBA2K servers is just a literal, utter, disgusting garbage, most of the time you'll find yourself getting kicked out by the server because the server is experiencing some issues
- The other game modes like ProAM, BlackTop, MyGM is just worthless imo, there's no 'signature' mode other than the ones I've listed above
- AI difficulty is just as bad as FIFA's. Tune it way up causes AI slider to significantly overpower you, 99 overall 3 point shooting Stephen Curry won't see you splash in 99 percent of the time, on the other end, tune it slightly down will see you using a 5'10 Chinese Lebron James just using Sprint button and dunking across 5 defenders. In conclusion, NBA2K failed to establish a comfortable middle ground AI behaviour for a casual + competitive environment
- Grinding: The 300+ hours you see on my account ? I should proudly say I spend 80% of the time grinding in the Park, play a online 3 v 3, do some passing, dunking, 3 pointers, rise and repeat that about a 1000 times, then you finally get to upgrade some skill points. Essentially, a Pay to Win game, more skill points -> better your character. This game relies MINIMALLY on skills and at the end of the day, you'll find yourself getting beaten by a 12 year old just cause their parents have more money than yours
- As this is the PC version of NBA2K21, you could literally spend the same or even less amount of money on the 'next-gen' version of NBA2K21 on consoles which have better texture, upgraded visuals and mechanics


[h1] What's fun : [/h1] 

- Dunking, 3 pointer, dribbling which you could do in real life but instead you chose to sit down in your parent's basement to press some buttons
- Splashing you money to NBA2K so that they can CTRL+C, CTRL+V their codings and designs for the next NBA2K


[h1] CPU / GPU Specs : [/h1] 

- Intel® Core™ i9-9900 Processor
- Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER

Each year, 2K gets terrible reviews and gets ripped apart for their launch day glitches and bugs, but I've always known they'll get fixed. I play myLEAGUE, myCAREER, and myTEAM a ton. This years' game has everything it needs to be great. But the shooting. The shooting in this game is so unexplainably terrible, the game isn't worth buying at all. If the 2K team releases a patch for the shooting, it'll change everything. I've put almost 16 hours of gameplay in over this release weekend, and for an example of the terrible shooting mechanics, I'll say this: In a practice (no defense whatsoever), I shot 2/25 on wide open mid-range jumpers with KOBE BRYANT, one of the greatest scorers in NBA history. You could say ""get gud"" or that I', garbage, but I've literally been playing 2k and other NBA games my entire life. The mechanics for getting a ""green"" are broken. In an attempt to create a more ""realistic"" experience for scoring, 2K has created the most unrealistic shooting game in the history of basketball games. NBA Jam is better. I give this game 0/10 stars, and if you're considering buying it, wise up.

MyCareer is 90% scripted garbage in the beginning. You can't change camera or length of halves....so you get 10 minute halves for a college game. Your player sucks out of the gate so he isn't going to hit anything. The shooting mechanic sucks so bad I can't believe it was left in for release. The shot meter is barely visible on a PC monitor and button shooting has all but been completely broken in the game if not impossible. Microtransactions are everywhere in the game and its obvious they make you suck horribly just so you will get frustrated and buy coins to level up your player.

Some other studio needs to compete with 2K in basketball and quick. This has gotten completely out of hand. Your player also moves like he is stuck in molasses and can't change directions easily at all. It is so clunky. Teammates are still dumb as rocks and hold the ball forever, don't box out, don't guard, don't switch on D correctly and the game still randomly switches you on D to someone you have no chance of guarding for no apparent reason. The draft combine sucks and is the worst 20 minutes of mini games you will ever put yourself through. The story in MyCareer is beyond annoying, trite and ridiculously scripted against you. I have no idea what anyone was thinking putting this nonsense into a basketball game. Perhaps 2K should make a visual novel since that seems to be what they are going for here. Meanwhile we just want to play basketball and not have microtransactions shoved in our face constantly or telling us we are mediocre when we have good games....just so we will level our player up by buying stupid coins.

2K has lost it. Completely lost it. This game is a pile of trash. I got it on sale and I still feel ripped off.This is the worst 2K basketball I've ever played. It is so bad. People are not exaggerating when they say it is bad.

MyCareer also only works online and this is unnecessary. It is done so that players who enjoy this mode will be forced to buy the latest 2K NBA but it is a very unethical practice. So you are renting the game for 59.99 for 2 years if all you play is offline. This should be illegal but it is not b/c some of the game works. But no more for me. This is it. I'm not renting a game for 2 years and I own far too many other games for one to be disabled in that short of time.",1625362712,1671430641,False,1,0,0.505494534969329834,0,True,False,False

But then they released the ""next-gen"" version that had ALL of that added back in, and a completely different neighbourhood then current gen. Why they won't update the PC version to the newer version, or even sell a ""next gen upgrade"" for 20 bucks, I'll never know.

- If you dont shoot greens, you miss 99% of the time

- HoF difficulty AI is stupid, you can play in the best teams with best players, but they cant hit or do anything
- It dosent matter how many points you make, how good you play, your AI teammates sucks
- You can even miss open shots, layups and even dunks because the game says so
- Didint even try to play online or park because you know how it is in PC side

Shaq and Kenny doesn't even look at the camera, they keep looking the other way and so robotic. The My Player mode is laughable. You would need a lot of mods to fully enjoy this game, specially the half ass classic team roster. Most of the Classic teams only has 6-7 legit players, I actually have to create atleast 2 players on each classic teams so that the rotations be more accurate. I give up on this franchise, don't want to waste my money anymore. Not recommended, it is not worth a single penny.

On one hand, you have an amazing NBA simulation, the feeling of playing NBA 2K21 is like controlling a TV broadcast. Franchise mode offers tons of customization, you can become your own dynasty in the NBA in this game. MyCareer offers a great NBA simulation of being a player. The games feel realistic, exciting, and most of all fun. However, NBA 2K21 suffers from one massive issue. It doesn't differentiate between itself and NBA 2K20 to be worth purchasing. The franchise mode, while in depth, is just as in depth as NBA 2K20, as it doesn't change anything up enough to at all to be different to the older games. In the games themselves, the gameplay does not differ much from the older releases either. Just as last year, it suffers from a massive problem of microtransactions and shoving them down the players throat.

It is not a next gen experience on PC. For some reason PC users have to wait for an experience their PCs can handle.

MyCareer is different but missing lots of features from 2k20... There's a pre-NBA career with cut scenes and a handful of choices... Then it's back to the early games with just the NBA games and training to do for your character... Most if not all of the cut scenes are gone in their place is a larger neighbourhood... Ok when there was an online playerbase... Not so good now... Just wastes time going from A to B...

They also randomly destroy their user base with updates that corrupt save files, wiping thousands of hours of gameplay by corrupting their save files... All of mine and many others data has been corrupted, from myplayer to myleague they all got corrupted... This wouldn't be as big of an issue if their support was able to respond within 24 hours instead of the 4 days it takes them at best... And then they are completely useless, no idea where Steam stores their files...

The game also has random crashes that have been there since release as well as glitches with their community uploads which causes edits to team uniforms or arenas to not save once due to a connection issue...

There's also a game save bug where you cannot save you games after a certain time. Both MyCareer and MyLeague have been rendered useless in my game... EDIT found a fix for this myself... Regedit and deletion of save game folders...

If you really love basketball get 2k20... Or give 2k a few years to work out what they are doing wrong with the latest gen version before considering upgrading to the latest... If you are really desperate for the latest then expect a lot of bugs in 2k22...",1617875625,1641816100,False,4,0,0.52173912525177002,4,True,False,False

Pros:
	- Latest NBA game developed by 2K at review time with different changes around mods.
	- It is my second NBA game and from then a lot have changed.
	- The career mode is really fun to play with decisions to make etc.
  	-For me, (9 hours of play time at review time), the game crashed only once, and that was on quick play. I played with 60 hz and vsync/dynamic vsync on (it may help) and I also updated the graphics card drivers before starting to play.
	- For me, the shot meter feels realistic so it is not a problem.
Cons:
	- On multiplayer (for example 3vs 3 on MyTeam) there are some issues with the game ( mostly the crowd) - it moves with a little lag and latency issues, but that should be fixed with the next updates if there will be some.
	- When I first got into MyTeam (  around 72 OVR team), I tried to play multiplayer and the opponents the game found for me had around 95 OVR team.
	With these said, the PC version needs some updates to complete the game. I also need to mention that I installed the game on a SSD.",1614268924,1637782901,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Features missing, gameplay is bad, career mode gets more and more frustrating due to whatever adjustments have been made. Followed by the constant MTX ads, and extended loading times. Not to mention if you adjust framerate of the game, it causes the game to literally slow motion play out between timeouts, or when your player can simulate the time on the bench. And then, after the first patch, the game corrupted itself when updating. Had to uninstall and reinstall. A few weeks later, second patch, again, corrupted the entire game and had to reinstall everything. Surely, it wouldn't happen a third time, but wait, it did.

Have been playing 2K since 2K11 and this iteration was finally the breaking point for me. Honestly feels like a massive downgrade even to 2K20. My incentive to grind has been crushed by the lackadaisical effort to improve upon previous years persistent problems and the introduction of new, imo, game-breaking ones. I want to play a basketball sim to relax and enjoy my favorite sport, not engage in the absolute sweatfest that is playing this game, even offline against the CPU. I should not have to year after year be required to pay the price for this game as well as spend extremely unreasonable amounts of $$$ on VC just to make my MyPlayer usable, or make my MyTeam competitive.If this aggressive micro-transaction fueled model is what 2K wants to adopt....THEN MAKE IT FREE TO PLAY!

 Also us PC players were not even afforded the luxury of the next-gen version :/

It assumes that most people play MyCareer till they get to the NBA and go play Neighborhood afterwards. Speaking of the Neighborhood, the amount of hackers in the lobbies sickens me. Almost every person who displays a 90+ overall, their card shows a 60 overall, and they tend to green almost every shot they take even with a good amount of coverage. This is very frustrating when you are playing legitimately and you want to level up your Rep. Also, 99 overall cards basically ensures that every player has A / A+ stats on everything, even when those stats don't translate to real life. Take an Invincible Ben Simmons card for example. Ben Simmons is not an A+ 3pt shooter, even though he has improved for the most part. Also, the player AI isn't very realistic, as many players don't play like their real life selves at all. Also, if you are trying to guard someone, they will shift to a different area and as you follow, 99% of the time you will get stuck on a teammate, basically allowing the person a free shot.

If you already have a recent version of NBA 2K you can definitely pass on this one. There is nothing really new or earth shattering in the current version. In some ways it's something of a step backwards in areas such as the shooting mechanic. The graphics are not much improved either. If you are a big fan of the NBA and or the 2K series and you can get this title on sale at 50% off or more it's probably worth it. Be warned it is a VERY grindy experience and you will need to put in a fair bit of time or spend actual money on VC before you have a player who isn't totally frustrating to watch crawl up and down the court, miss wide open shots and jump barely high enough to touch the rim.

I've never felt so disrespected while playing a game in my entire life. Truly one of a kind in that respect. There is no competitor for basketball games leaving you two options.. play it or don't.. but be warned buying VC wont make your character better.. you're time gated to playing games and unlocking badges before your specialist can start to compete.

Whether its dunking, shooting or defense.. you can spend 100$+ to create an overall player rating of 90+ and no matter what you choose without badges you will miss your shots, dunks, blocks & the like.. even at 95 3pt shooting wide open unguarded 3's are bricked. Slashing with a 6'9 90+ finisher with no badges means that 6'1 defender will have you fumbling the take & in the most obscene ways possible missing your layup/dunks with no foul. Passing? If you're team is up 10+ points its better to let the AI double team and strip you everytime *which they will* because if you try and pass it out with even a 90+ passer rating you will overthrow 7ft tall centers standing wide open under the hoop. 

Even after pushing through and grinding games for a few badges you will be met with a completely disrespectful AI system that will have your own team stepping into your lanes to slow you down, avoiding your passes & refusing to pass you open looks. Play the game on whatever difficulty setting you want it doesn't change the level of disrespect built into this garbage dump. It really does look great from the outside looking in, especially when there is no other option for games like this.. but the reviews are no joke this game is awful on an entirely new level.

Point Guard - Me (98), Shooting Guard - RJ Barrett (84), Small Forward - Julius Randle (89), Power Forward - John Collins (84), Center - Mitchell Robinson (83), Bench Players: Nerlens Noel PF/C (80), Obi Toppin PF/SF (80), Immanuel Quickley SG/PG (80), Frank Ntilikina PG/SG (80), Blake Griffin PF/C (78).. 

We are currently 13-2 in our second season & I have managed to average a triple double over these 15 games with a stat line of 34 pts, 12 rebounds, 12 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, Shooting % is around 60 with 3pt also around 60%. I take around 20 shots a game.

I play on Hall of Fame difficulty & have noticed a trend starting after my first few wins. Nobody makes a shot on my team anymore. My starters & bench for the last game vs the Heat shot 23 times making a grand total of 3. T H R E E makes in TWENTY THREE shots. These are half time numbers because I rage quit before the game was over. Now in these three shots I had to get all three assists and STRUGGLED to make them happen. I personally had 24 pts with 85% shooting percentage.. we as a team had just over 30% shooting at the half.. I don't understand how much more difficult the game can get as I am single handled responsible for all of the defensive stops, rebounds & offensive production points, assists & offensive rebounds I am playing 9v1 with a team that has a Team Chemistry rating of 99%. I don't have fun at all playing anymore.. sometimes I would get a game here and there that gave me a somewhat good feeling afterwords .. not anymore. The only reason i've continued to play is my OCD itching me to reach 99 overall. I hope to reach it soon and walk away from the NBA2K franchise for good.",1626293605,1628745612,False,2,0,0.54314720630645752,0,True,False,False

I've been playing 2k since 2k11. I love the series, and there are no basketball sims out there to give it any form of competition. I saw this game on sale for like less than 10 dollars and had to give it a go. My review is solely based on a (PC) Association/Rebuilders perspective.

The Bad and Ugly.
AI is still incredibly exploitable in game and out of game. The simulation aspect is wonky and doesnt really work. The menus are complex with all these options that dont really mean anything sometimes. Shot tendencies have to be manually change to make people primary scorers even if you set them as the primary scorer. The coaching and plays system really doesnt work and i cant wrap my head around how to make things work. The rebuilding aspect is still fun however i have some more complaints about in game stuff:

1.Creating a draft class has absolutely pitiful design options. There are so few options, autogenerated people feel the same after two classes. No hairs, no hair options, no hair colors, no design freedom. A huge stepback in creating draft classes. It seems all the design options are locked behind myplayer park stuff now.

2.Players doing fuck all in game. Centers and powerforwards will just sit in place and not move. whether its on the 3 line, on the baseline, or anywhere really. The game literally breaks. players wont set baseline screens themselves, or attempt to get shooters open. They all just stand there. When you manually call screen either the guy wont move then immediately roll to the basket, or he will screen, the D will instantly switch and you are denied. But sometimes the pick and roll works and the AI does absolutely nothing to defend against the center or pf and just allows free buckets. This is really boring.

3. Greenlighting. I hate this mechanic when trying to control 10 people on the floor. If you get slightly early or late at the 3 line you have about a 20 percent chance of making 3s. Midrange is even worse bricking wide open shots. The game wants you to use hotzones, badges, and greenlighting to make shots but memorizing 10 peoples shots, their zones, timings just isnt reasonable. Like why is it so difficult to make wide open shots. Meanwhile the AI just chucks bad shots up and they go in. The paint is so broken because people driving to the basket just get insane bonuses and if aren't directly blocked have almost a 80 percent chance of making the shot. SO if you want to effectively score just drive to the basket. It doesnt help that Ai GLUES to you on the 3 line then breaks down into tears when you drive to the basket.

Other than that the mycareer sucks. I hate how your character is limited to certain builds. I think they should split the career and park in my humble opinion. But that wouldnt work well for them paygating progress. The card casino game-mode is cheeks and always will be. All in all it feels like 2k continues to regress and give less options to people as time goes on. The game runs slow, crashes, doesnt load in things, and the netcode was good in 2009. Shit game but there are no alternatives.

But hey at least we got the WNBA in game, and when loading into match i get useless videos playing through 2ktv to further slow my loading times and slow the game down :)",1627952408,1627952408,False,20,1,0.734024107456207275,0,True,False,False

When I was a child, I had picked up 2K8 and played it on the PS3, it was my first 2K game and I was instantly a fan of the series. Years have gone by, various 2k titles have come and gone, some better than others... some worse, but then there was 2k21. 2k21, was supposed to be 'the next big thing'. 'Redefined from the ground up with the power of next gen consoles', yet the next gen edition isn't even available to those who have devices twofold the power of these new consoles? 

Every single year, it's the same game, over and over again, empty promises, and very very small changes to the MyCareer, and gamemode selection, i.e narrative, roster/depth chart changes, and character nicknames. The same commentary dialogue has been used for a decade, the same sloppy animations have been used for half a decade, they even took out the Halftime Show when they moved from 20 to 21. I thought we were supposed to add assets from one title to the next, not remove them? 

I want to like this game, I want to like this series, I want to so bad, because they're the only people that can make it. They have the funding and licenses, and they know people will pick up their POS copy-and-paste title year after year, because we have no choice. 

2k21 is a redundancy; another iteration in the bleak year-by-year cycle. It's a slap in the face to any real basketball fan. It's genuinely a waste of time to purchase this on a PC for anything less than an on-sale price, and that's being generous. At this point, go back. Play older titles that you know will bring you joy. There is no sign of a fix for this franchise coming in the near future, and it's apparent they do not care for the PC community.

And thats all the pros. 

Here are the cons:
-Shot aiming, the dev guy who came up with it - ought to be shot. 
-This is basically a 2k20. Just roster updates, No, not roster updates - they basically added new players via player creation. Everything in the roster remained the same. They didnt even bother updating the profile picture. 
- Oh yeah, the same ol same ol. same interface, roster face, same my league, same like last year and the year before and before. 
-This is what prompt me to leave a review: CPU played horrendous transition defence. I have my PG grabbing the defensive rebound - CPU instead backing down to defend leave their man and start double teaming me. A flick on the pass button I immediately turn this into a 4 vs 2 fastbreak. This is horrendous CPU defensive logic. No amount of sliders can fix this. It rendered the game unplayable. 
 
I'm no longer surprise 2K dont bother even come up with a patch to fix this. 2K just wants to grab your money and go. Thankfully I only grab this during a steam holiday discount.

Net play- Garbage connectivity, no cheat detection. You've won a jackpot if you manage to find a stable, fair net matchup and yet they've made it a requirement for unlocking animations or accessories for your character.

MyTeam- Speaking of jackpots, new and improved MyTeam gambling complete with 0 ownership of your players. That's right, they have limited use now and get your wallet ready if you want to maintain the good ones you've picked up.

MyCareer- This is the one I'm most disappointed in, as bad as everything else is. Literal selling point for this series for so long, you'd think 2K would want to hold onto its longevity. Big whopping NOPE. Between gridlock online DRM causing crashes/disconnects/unplayability, to trying to play with anything over 60 FPS causing gameplay issues and crashes, and even a complete gut of any attempt to customize your character now being limited to unbearable online play. And they call this release next-gen? We had 4K 60 FPS a decade ago, this is a JOKE.

As far as the gameplay its pretty fun and I like what they added with the badges for your player. The gameplay is challenging but rewarding when you get to your spots and make shots.

However there is a very gamebreaking issue I run into REGULARLY. In order to upgrade your players stats you accumulate VC and you get VC after completing games, or so I thought. I'll play a game or 2 before checking my VC balance only to find out I didn't get any VC for the previous games I have played. I have probably missed out on 15,000 VC by now and it is so frustrating. It seems like this is a bug that has been in the game SINCE RELEASE, yet 2K hasnt fixed it at all. Not sure if its a business strategy to get players to purchase VC or just gross negligence by 2K, but its embarassing a large company like 2K has such a glaring issue with their game. I have played 29 hours in the last week and I have decided to uninstall the game because it is too frustating to deal with. Save yourself the money until 2K shows they care about their playerbase because right now it seems like they know people will buy their game regardless of the quality. I will give NBA2K22 a chance because I like the gameplay, but if its dogshit like this one is, 2K will have lost another customer",1625646766,1625646766,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Problem 1. Animations
There have always been a select few animations that everybody used to look better or play better. Apparently, the perfectly okay animations weren't good enough for EA, because all of the good ones have been changed. They look extremely different and confused me when I first started playing the game and it screwed up all of my animations that I used to use

Problem 2. Shot timing
If you were good at the old shooting, boy are you in luck, not. The shot timing in this game is awful. It's basically impossible to make a shot with any defense on you.

I have nothing else to say as other reviews on the internet suggest this game is horrible lmao. (edit- I forgot to mention the horrendous ai in this game. Its like playing with a bunch of blind men, the ai cant see that im leading the fucking fast break and takes forever to pass. Im the god damn point guard and they wont pass to me?! Not only is the ai horrendous but the player control is also. There is an obvious delay in my controller and how am I supposed to guard the ai if i cant react to the offense and get blown by every single time. Another thing is my player getting stuck on the other ai cause holy shit ill get stuck on a player on my own team and I leave my man open. My teammate grade is awful because of this shitty game. However I find myself to keep playing cause for some reason it is addicting but I hate this game with all of my heart. If 2k actually reads their reviews maybe they wont have their entire community shit on them, instead they continue to have these bugs in the game and won't bother to fix cause they are getting ready to copy and paste this game into 2k22. I have no faith that these fixes will ever come because I have experienced this in 2k18, 19, 20, and this piece of crap game.)",1624927791,1625033550,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

conclusion: wrost 2k so far, not worth the money at all. 
1. Every time enter the game need to update the shooting settings again, in every single game. saved the setting couple times still requires to change the shooting setting to PC whenever enters a  new game.
2. game does not seem to be appealing to me as previous 2k, played less than 20 hours and gave up.
3. only to install it again as my newphew is visiting me during school holiday and he was able to get it for free from steam. both of us plays single player content only. god I spent 1 hour trying to connect us using "" play online with friends "". as my newphew is a minor and had no control over his mobile phone to install nba 2k21 app, we could not get it done.
4. wrost 2k at all.  no wondering Epic gave it for free. I spent around 25-30 dollar to purchase it and feels like money wasted for nothing. in the meatime i still have 2k14 and 2k10 on my computer and each has more than 600 hours playing time.",1624777569,1624777569,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is subpar, and has a lot of issues within MyLeague, including like the last few years, randomly deleting or corrupting saves that contain various custom teams/content immediately after their first save & exit, and also a STRONG resistance to ever keeping your custom alternate jerseys for custom made expansion teams. Unlike the last couple of years though, 2K21 actually straight up refuses to allow custom jerseys at all half the time for custom expansion teams. It just straight up denies it and tells you no. It's f**ked. Other annoying things like half the time it won't even be willing to load in custom teams from the servers either. The list goes on.

And something that has been present through all iterations of NBA 2K is the random cheese where you clearly block a shot or steal a pass, but the game casually says ""nope"" and phases the ball and even the hands and arms of the players you're defending THROUGH you, giving itself baskets, generally screwing you over.

Also a huge negative for me is that they pulled the extra customization options on create a player after 2K15. That customization was FIRE. I loved it and thrived on it. I lived on that for creating all sorts of players, scenarios and situations to have fun with in Association Mode (MyLeague). They really need to bring that back, so that not every player ever always looks the exact same.

A peeve of mine is that they consistently have more features and customization options all over on their console editions of the game, but refuse to transfer it over to PC. Like, no tats even? REALLY? You'be had in there on the console version of the game for YEARS, yet you still refuse to add it into the PC edition? There's no logical reasons for all of that crap. They don't even charge more for the console versions of the game over the PC version, so it is not profit-driven. It's dumb.

And this is in general - if you add the WNBA to the game, why wouldn't you just go all the way with it, and allow people to create WNBA players, too? Why only half-ass it? It's lazy and makes no sense, again.

It's the same crap every single edition, meaning every single year. They really never update, add or change anything. And the rarity they do the latter, it's usually something stupid no one really likes, like changing the controls around, and/or randomly adding or altering mechanics of play. So, 2K games are never worth the money. And to add more to it? MyCareer is also pretty much the same each year, too. But if you want the EA Lite experience, then buy the games each year, and play MyCareer each time, and pay that real world money to them to get fake money so it's actually playable and not a waste of time to play at all.",1623991206,1623991206,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All these things could be fixed pretty easily of course, but the developer is suffering from the same problem every other sports dev is suffering from: Microtransactions. All of these games now only concentrate on the stupid card game scams, leaving all other development behind.

-----

Update:

Okay an additional 100 hours later.
Don't buy this game, at least for PC.

Pros: 
When not playing online, this game is great. I mainly play career mode and the ability to create a player in a position and play to the playoffs is a mostly fun experience. The neighborhood emotes and cosmetic features for the game are goofy in a fun and makes playing with your friends an enjoyable experience.

Cons: 
Career mode can get old pretty fast, and creating a new player is either a repetitive grind or a drain on the wallet. Online can be really fun, especially if you have friends to play with BUT, the park is usually filled to the brim with hackers to the point where finding a fair game is a task in itself.

General Complaining:
I wouldn't recommend playing this game, especially if you've owned any 2k since 2018. it's pretty much copy paste the only thing you'll really be getting out of this game is a very slight graphics upgrade and an updated roster. I have 2k20 on PS4 and honestly couldn't tell a difference....

...Except that for PC is filled with hackers. Epic recently breathed some new life into the game when they offered the game for free and so many new people came to the park. I thought it would be a good moment to consistently get some fair matches, but you can only play the park so much before you run into strangely unbeatable games and then realize that people hacked this game within the first 2 months of the games release.

So now for the new players to enjoy this game they turn to hacks, and the older players were already hacking , turning to hacking, or just dropping the game.

I don't really blame the new players, especially if you're new to this game which can already be somewhat technically difficult, for turning towards hacking the game. There's seemingly no repercussions and the process to reporting anyone is not exactly the easiest to do (2k requires video evidence to be recorded and sent to them). and if you play 20 games 17 of those games probably has one hacker on their team. So if you can't beat them join them I guess?

2K clearly doesn't care about the PC experience and its pretty blatant when people are using a software used to hack flash games in 2007 can be used to max out your stats and update your online rank to legend in 20mins. The game by itself has some pretty questionable mechanics before the the hackers are mixed into the equation, but the micro-transactions, mixed with general team-play toxicity, mixed with unplayable online games makes this game pretty one dimensional (offline team-play, career-mode).

Bottom Line:

If you absolutely need to get this game get it on console. It's pretty pointless to get it on PC unless you're getting it specifically to hack your stats.",1618466981,1622180879,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I feel like the pros of this game have long been talked about. Most of the pros with this game are only pros because this is the ONLY basketball game with at least somewhat of a realistic vibe to it. NBA Live lacks depth in such an extreme manner, and since EA doesn't give a shizzle about actually devoting time and effort into a game to compete, and is mostly looking for a piece of the predatory monetization pie; 2K is always the superior game. Most of the pros of this game were the pros of 2k20, 2k19, 2k17... you get the idea. It's been pretty much the same game since 2k14. That's not a surprise. 

The cons set in when you realize why EA doesn't care about ""competing"" with 2k; Predatory monetization is in full effect here. The amount of VC you gain per game is beyond atrocious. It might be ""realistic"" to not become a bona-fide GOAT by the end of your first season in the NBA, but I guarantee no one cares about MyCareer to play in the NBA, they only care about the park. 2k knows this; that's why the MyCareer literally has no story now. (It's sad too, that this is actually a good thing). You are very lucky if you get 2000 VC inside of one NBA game, playing on 12 minute quarters on the easiest difficulty. You can make like; 30 threes in a game and you still probably will not get 2000 VC a game. Getting from 80 overall to 87 takes about 200000 VC; so you're looking at 100 full NBA games just to get up 7 overall. You're still not even a 90 overall yet. I imagine the VC you will make from the endorsements and daily spins might get you about from 87 to 91 or so from there. It's just ridiculous how slow you progress in this game. After about 100 hours or so, it becomes so tiresome, that you've kinda got all the entertainment out of just the offline. 

The park is not even close to being as fun. You have to fight against lag, cheesy animations, and being way underleveled than everyone else for a good 100 hours by the time you're able to catch up to your opponents. This is a game that needs an option to have skill based matchmaking, so you're able to stand a chance against your opponents. Otherwise you're stuck with 90 overall shot creators who green literally everything, and you're screwed. 

MyTeam is not fun either. The contracts are the ultimate buzzkill for the mode, and on PC; triple threat constantly crashes when you try to play it. Pack luck is just as bad as it has always been, and this mode is absolutely not Free to play, unless you actually care to waste all your free time playing it.

MyLeague is fun still. Theres a reason most NBA youtubers only play it now. It's the only mode thats not pay to win, and doesn't even require a single bit of VC to enjoy. Though the exact same exploits to build an all-time great team are still in effect, and it's limited as a result. They need to overhaul the MyLeague badly. 

Crashes are a regular feature with the PC version. You'll crash sometimes in MyCareer games, editing rosters, editing players, and more. You have to play the game at 60 fps, or else animations completely break. If that happens, why even include options to have more than 60 FPS?


It's just not fun to play this game anymore. 2K17 was my first 2k I experienced when it was online, and I admit I had quite a bit of fun, but this grind has gotten awful. I really hope someday a better alternative comes along, but I highly doubt that will ever happen. 2K used to be so great. Having made an NFL game that STILL is the best football game after 16 years. Now they're just a shell of themselves. All caught up in the awful capitalist system. They only want money. That's all they care about.",1622098349,1622098349,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game isnt NextGen even though PC is OBVIOUSLY FAR SUPERIOR to consoles which just points that 2k getting a obviously sizable cut from PS5 and Xbox Series X sales.

My Career is lacking any individuality or any control of your career. Just rename it the Story Mode, because the player gets no choice in what happens in the career. What if I wanted to go straight to the G-League out of high school? What if I wanted to play overseas for a few seasons? What if I wanted to play all 4 years of college? This isnt hard to ask. As a professional in the field of IT, I would know if this would take large amounts of coding and it doesnt. Yoiuve gotten contracts from CBL teams and EuroLeague teams quite easily. Just re-skin stuff at least and hire announcers to announce it. You guys are a multi-billion dollar game studio. Its as easy as ""Here is some money for a multi-year contract""

MyTeam is still the pay to win junk box it always has been. I don't touch it at all because I like money more than fiction cards and some 13 year old yelling at their mom in through the mic.

Park it still bad and has not changed rather than a different layout and a rehash of old events with the same prices

MyLeague: Once again 2k doesnt make thew game current and doesn't put in any effort for the MyLeague fans. Literally their most hardcore fan base should be getting more and instead we got a boring MyGM story with no voice lines, bad player overall progression, and you still cant play G-League games (WHY IS THAT ONLY A NEXT GEN FEATURE???). No Association version for the WNBA which is just more sexist behavior. AGAIN, Its not hard to program. 

All in all its an easy to execute concept devoured by a money sucking organization. ""MyCareer"" is just TheirCareer. MyTeam ""Buy cards that are only worth something for 1 year than buy the next game and spend more money on worthless cards"". MyLeague is hasnt been improved for 3 games now. All this while not having it be in ""NextGen"" graphics because Sony and Microsoft bought out 2K.

I am no basketball nor a good NBA2K player, I never played the ""Ultimate Team"" Mode of the game but bought it because of the ""Story Mode"". But I do like watching basketball, I get the rules and I know my way around a good game so here goes my opinion.

The Movement of the players feels nice and you have great control over the players moves, the graphics is by far the best out of all major sports games respect to 2K for this achievement. However games are about more than just the looks. And I LOVE the customization from MyLeague, it is something every football and american football fan dreams about. 
The historic Teams are therre but I do miss my Charlotte Bobcats logo because that logo was dope.

Although there are bugs they mostly aren't a big problem to me at least and very infrequent.

So what is?

1. This game is a terrible peace of software. Yes bugs are very infrequent but to spot them I ave to be able to start the god damn game! Multiple times patches made it impossible for me to even start the game something I have never encountered on steam ever, I can not stress this enough.

2. While I never played the ultimate team mode it is still existent and I have big problems with the predatory selling techniques game publishers like 2K and EA use to milk their fans out of every single available cent.

3. While many things are great one thing 2k never thought of is the fact that I do not care for their god damn interviews before every single game, even worse you can not mute them, so I had to tae the hit on my eardrums every single time.

4, This is the most important part... the story. Sadly it is embaressing.
Is it better than EAs Madden Story, well yes but that is a low bar to climb, It would be like praising yourself for outrunning a 4 year old who has been tied to a pick up truck. 
I played the story multiple times in multiple ways to test it. 
It barely changes no matter what you do, the dialogues stay the same. Building your own personality is done in a 40sec interview scene as part of the draft. 
2k why do you think I would give even a remote shit about secondary characters in a story that is 2h long??? Give me inerviews let me build up my character and clash with the public, coaches and maybe even my teams because of that. I want to suffer the consequences of being an egotistical ass but playing a terrible season. Nothing like this will ever happen.

Your relationship to your agent, gf and best frenemy end in 5second cutscenes. For some reason 2k thought you need a nickname so every idiot in the story constantly refers to you as junior (just stop it 2k, a generic wow what a dunk by the center/shouting guard etc. would have been preferable)

The famous 2K story is nothing to talk about and is the main reason for my disappointment.
Still the game mechanics are pretty goodish so if you just want to play basketball you will have some enjoyable hours but for me there are still to many things lacking being the main reason I buy around 1 NBA game every 5-10 years. The game not starting is driving me crazy so if you buy this game buy it on a sale.
This has been about the first time I encounter a game with good mechanics but everything else being so lackluster that I just can't reccomend it in good conscience.
If I had to give it a number I would call it a 4,5/10 because of the vast amount of content this game has.

On one hand, its a fairly fun game with repetitive mechanics (played all versions since 2k15 on PS4). Career mode is okay, intro story is a bit draggy and sometimes mechanics are so ridiculous (i.e. passing and intercepting etc) that it can get quite annoying. But overall, can't blame it for the rush job that it is (because of next gen, which I hear isn't a step up). 

The downside, it gets boring, fast. The career mode grind (badges and VC) is too slow which always leaves a lingering feeling of ""do i want to drop more $$ for VC or just play the game"". Park latency is also a problem but that's maybe because I'm in Southeast Asia. Park would be fun, if servers supported players here or maybe that's just my ISP. 

The other modes are okay, but have never tried to play with WNBA teams. 

Despite this, I will still continue to play this game. T.T",1621848327,1621848327,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

James"" is much better than some random guy on the bench and can rail an entire team by himself (which, to be honest, was quite lovely to watch). for a company that supports the black community so much, i am disappointed in the amount of inequality between people ""L. James"" and ""S. Curry"" and the rest of his teams. finally, i am at my last complaint, my wits end — why are there no mods for removing the clothes of the players. i would certainly enjoy seeing players like tiger woods or cristiano ronaldo without any clothes, and i know im not just speaking for myself. its unbelievable that i have to play every single game while they are fully clothed. i paid 80 dollars for this game and i cannot even see my favorite men in their final form. utterly disappointing. again, i am sorry for having to release such a negative review. once all the players are balanced and i can see all of them without clothes, i will give this game a MASTERPIECE rating. bye !",1621748658,1621748658,False,1,0,0.47677159309387207,0,True,False,False

well, on the lowest difficulty, my shooting percentage is usually a whopping 3 percent and that is if im lucky.  doesnt matter if i time the shot perfectly..  doesnt matter if im in the paint and the shot is a layup.. its ALWAYS a bad shot according to the AI and i almost always miss.. even the simplest of layups.  the issue seems to be that im never really open.  from the vids ive seen you have to have about a foot distance between yourself and the defender.  if the shot IN ANY WAY is contested its a miss.  this gets real frustrating as i find it almost impossible to get open.  and when im on the lowest difficulty these kind of variables shouldnt be a factor.

also, you cant adjust the sliders and give yourself a handicap so you can at least have some fun in mycareer.  nope.. no fun in 2k21 it seems.  and the reason they dont allow you to adjust the sliders is because it would make the game easy.  they cant have this in mycareer because of the VC you earn.. and VC is the experience AND the premium currency.  

MLB the show does it right.  yes, they have premium currency that you can buy with real money, but you earn it in various ways.. and the boosts come through gear which is optional.. at least with the road to the show mode.  also, when i execute a good pitch or hit a base hit or homerun.. my character is rewarded with experience that will directly levels hitting.. if i strike someone out, i get experience that directly affects my pitching attributes... these experience points are completely separate from the premium currency.  and when it comes to the gear that you can buy with currency..as stated, its optional.

 and easy is easy.. medium is medium.. and hard is hard.  and just like in 2k21.. scoring in MLB the show is extremely challenging.  but only if i want it to be.  and when i play these games.. i dont have a problem with inflated stats.. also, even when the difficulty is low i still have that small amount of failure.  this option is NOT available in 2k21 mycareer and its because the experience you earn is also the premium currency they use to make money.

i tried the GM mode because it looked interesting.. but in the end i found it tedious.. and mycareer is nothing but a frustrating mess and completely not fun at all... and 100% pay to win.  challenging is fine but if im on the lowest difficulty it should be easy and not impossible.

Graphics: 4.5/5 – Great job, but I feel like they can do better
Music/Sound: 5/5 NBA 2K has always did amazing soundtracks and
Gameplay/Plot: 3/5 - This can change depending on many factors involving your own character build and the team that you get drafted into. MyCareer has a decent story arc involving a High School and College rival, but even if you completely outperform him and win both High School and College Championships, he still gets the #1 spot on the draft which makes absolutely no sense.
Controls 5/5: - must have a controller, otherwise, I like the controls. 
Technical issues/AI issues: 2/5 - so many factors limit this, especially if you make a character that is not the best option and get drafted into a team that needs more than just you or does not need you (The AI kind acts retarded.) The game is still playable but is prone to crashes and the AI tends to not do anything for seconds at a time.
The various issues in this game is extremely comprehensive but to make a long story short, if you are just a normal casual player and not familiar what is going on currently in the NBA you are going to suffer because this game has become a Pay to Win game or Grindfest, has ineffective AI unless their ratings are higher than the other position, and the online community still has cheaters despite all the major changes to the character development and point system. 
I have played NBA 2K9 while I was on Deployment and NBA 2k14 in my first year of college, so I have some experience with this series. I have also put about 50 hours into this game in the last 2 weeks. 
In MyCareer, this game essentially forces you to do research before you create a character and drafted into a team. You essentially must know what position your team “needs” to fill before you decide what to build. And when I say “needs”, I mean you must be drafted onto the right team that requires those gaps to be filled to round out their roster otherwise you and your team is going to suffer playing against superior AI in that role because the AI simply gets stomped on. 
You must dedicate several hours watching various YouTube videos, searching web sites, and stay up to date on any trades the NBA teams. You must understand the best optimized solutions for skill breakdown, potential, wingspan, height, weight, all the badges, what team is lacking with what position/s they need. 
So, I have about 50 games into my SF build and, despite doing a bit of research, I realized that the Houston Rockets today is not the same Rockets at the start of the season. Although, at the start of the season, the Rockets had James Harden and Russell Westbrook and an entirely different starting lineup, I purchased this game a few weeks ago not realizing that the Rockets no longer has anyone on their initial starting lineup. So, we essentially have the worst team in the NBA albeit John Wall is a good Point Guard. This team needs to replace every position because everyone is in the 70s on this team. I did not realize that until after I rewatched the video and realized that the Rockets had a completely roster.
With that being said, I want to explore the complete mental retardation of the AI on a low performing team (and keep in mind, when you first start out on an NBA team, your own team almost always starts off not liking you and actively plays against you even when you are calling for passes:
1. When you go up to make a pick, these idiots hand you the ball instead of going around you or playing off you. It makes no sense! I do not even think kids do this at middle school basketball courts.
2. For some reason, when the Forwards and Centers has a lower rebounding stat than their competition, they do not try to get rebounds. I even saw one of my centers jab step away from the ball when he was literally directly below it which allowed the other teams to reach out directly above him to get the rebound. that made absolutely no sense!
3. If you stop moving around, sometimes it could take several seconds before the AI on your team to shift gears and take any type of initiative on their own. 
I am sure that I am missing many, many other issues with the AI, but those tend to happen the most.
Regardless, I did create a great 2-Way SG. But that is after watching YouTube videos for best player builds. I could imagine that this is infuriating for casual players that might not watch a whole lot of Basketball or might not play video games.
After watching a dozen videos, I created a fantastic 3-Point Sniper and Perimeter Guard and I am currently getting about 40 points, 5 assists, 3 steals, 3 rebounds per match and even made 15 3-pointers in one match. After watching the top teams team requiring a SG, I went to the Mavericks and I am currently at 30 wins and 3 losses with them so far.
Now that goes without saying, there still are issues that simply do not make any sense:
1. Even though I beat my High School/ College Rival winning both the High School and College Championships against him, he still got drafted into the NBA as Pick 1 while you are stuck at Pick 2.
2. We got drafted onto the same **** team… the Mavericks!
3. Although I did take the starter position away from the actual starting SG, the Mavs traded away Cobb! Which does not make any sense because he was the 4th best player on the team, and we had a better bench with Cobb. This team has 17 players and most of them are Guards. We need PF and another C. At least Cobb could have also fulfilled SF/SG roles and kept pounding the other times off the bench. Absolutely no sense.
4. Of course, once you start getting awards like NBA/Rookie Player of the Week/Month, the AI starts acting retarded. Instead of passing to you or setting it up to pass it to you, they start ignoring you until you start giving assists.
5. We have lost 3 times simply because the AI quit moving. As in, they simply are not responding to stimulation allowing the other team rebounds and make easy buckets with no defense.
The issue in this game is not just with the AI… it is also technical issues as well:
1. This game crashed on me 3 times so far. After I had amazing matches and I get a ton of points and fans, the game seems to like crashing right before post game sponsorships send you messages congratulating you. I am not sure if that is what the issues is, but I feel like that is the source. 
2. For some reason, I cannot logon to the MyNBA2K21 app and website because my Steam account is somehow not registered… so I cannot upload my own designs or my Face…
Now, I have not even tried to play online with The Neighborhood, MyTeam, or MyNeighborhood but at this point it is a pay to win game.
I understand that this game has a history with cheaters. I like the concept of badges, point development, and requiring your character to level up through MyCareer to develop their character, but I just saw a guy on MyNeighborhood with a rating of 255 when the max rating should be 99.
If you do not create a decent MyCareer character and get him on a decent team, your progress, adding points, and even getting badges will go slower than if you created a overpowered character. $50 for 200,000 VC points though.
Otherwise, my main guy gets about 1120 VC per game so to get 200,000 VC points without spending money will take 178 games. My other guy is lucky to get 600 VC.
It really depends on whether you want to grind out the game or not… because you will.
Anyway, I love the NBA Quickplay and the WNBA is a great addition. Still, the core of the game is essentially Pay to Win, filled with ineffective AI, and online is filled with people who have played for years.",1621127912,1621127912,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] Cons [/h1]
[olist]
    [*] First off, as others pointed out as well, it is the same game with the last year. Some of you may argue that ""what might they could possibly change?"", well let me tell you. MyCareer is everything to this game and it should be the main focus of developers. As soon as you step out of collage and enter the NBA with your character, all the fun ends [b]COMPLETELY.[/b] 
    [*] Yes, the fun ends. You might again come up with All-Stars and Play Off's, but really. Even if you perform superb in those, all you get a record in your career book. Not a single reward, not a cut scene, nothing at all regarding the story. This is [b]RIDICULOUS.[/b] 
    [*] You start playing MyCareer with ""PRO"" difficulty. As you progress along, you find that this difficulty is quite easy and you want to see some more. However, when you increase the difficulty of game in MyCareer, you immediately realize the mistake you have done. The diffuculty curve is beyond exponential. The defence and offence you are facing becomes  [b]RIDICULOUS[/b]. Meanwhile, your cursed goat herding team stays the same, allowing every score, and not improving as you raise the difficulty.
    [*] Some players are ridiculously OP. Doncic, D'Angelo Russel, Antetekoumpo cannot be defended on difficulties ""All-Star"" and beyond.
    [*] Commentators did a good job overall yet they give same reaction whether an AlleyHoop is a monster kind or it is a weak, ""Lay Up"" type. This is not amusing. 

[h1]Pros [/h1]
     [*] It is an NBA game and we love it.
[/olist]

Now, I am sincerely not happy to criticize this much, yet I believe that the game would be a masterpiece if developers start to consider some of the feedback. Maybe instead of launching the same game every damn year, they might improve the points that I mentioned above. 

They already update the game frequently with the roster etc. Maybe they can launch NBA 2K franchaise every 2 or 3 year. But nah, they earn tons of money aren't they. Then again, if they would do that by any chance, they'll avoid [b]Mostly Negative[/b] reviews.

I don't know guys. I still love the game but I feel like the good effort is wasted meaninglessly. If even a casual player like me who has literally no expertise with developing game can state these problems with ease, then there is something going wrong.


*UPDATE*

Still a sh*t game. Tried to play some MyTeam and faced absolute massacre. If are new and ifyou play online, you simply cannot win because opposing team plays with 3 to 5 gods, while you play with -at best- 90-95 overall some mediocre player.

If you want to play single player, maybe some daily challanges, you again cannot possibly win because you face 99-99-99 Kobe, Duncan and Garnett for example. They. do. not. miss. Only way you stop them scoring is a well fuckin timed block which you probably get 1 out of 10 games because they have all have intense speed attributes. So no, you cannot win. You just need to hit all your threes, not miss a single one.

Honestly, fuck this game and its abnormal imbalanced gameplay. You've been biting people's pockets since what 2007? And yet the game you present is just horrible.

If you haven't played 2K before, wait until any of the last 5 go on sale, and you'll basically have the same experience minus the current rosters/players.

I understand the problem is 2k not bringing anything new to the table and can't fix their online bs. The smallest expamle of this could be the animations, like even the dunks are the same we had in 2k11 i think ? and never actually changed or anything lol.

I really don't know how it performs when it comes to Park thingy or any online future except normal private match sessions which i played with my friend. And it was playable,kinda shocked me after all these comments.But it works.
+ Ppl say there are still hackers around so don't even bother buying the game if you wanna play The Park Mode.

We are literally forced to play this game till someone else decides to make an actual good basketball game. I gave up on EA aswell.

The reason im recomming this is because i mainly play the game for My League and My GM. Which are perfectly fine. Also no problems with my Non - Online My Player experience either.
Also i bought it cuz i didn't get the 2k20. Just don't even bother upgrading if it's not on sale.

And finally i have no issues playing this game at 2k res and ultra setting with 2070 super. The only problem with that was when i played private matches with my friend where the game capped itself to 60fps for no reason.

Without internet access, it was the only way to give updated yearly rosters. Since the advent of the modern console, that problem can be completely eradicated. Unfortunately, the greed surrounding these franchises keeps subpar games like this coming.

This game is not the ""next gen"" version. This makes little sense considering PCs are not locked into older hardware, but I digress. You will not get access to the cool new cities. Yes, there is a new layout. No, there are no functional changes outside of that since last year. The few changes i noticed were missing cut scenes. When you enter stores you are no longer greeted. There is no pregame show this season either. Shaq and Kenny make a couple guest announcing appearances but its not the same.

My biggest problem is that the controls are not as fluid as last year. The pro stick consistently wants to do dribble moves instead of taking a shot. I didn't have this issue last year. It makes the game nearly unplayable and Ive gone back to 2k20 a few times just to clear my frustration.

1. The game doesn't have a built-in way to remove MyPlayer and the related face scan. Not only that, I've hunted for a hack to do this and can't find it. There are tons of instructions for resetting a face (deleting the saved data) on console versions, but similar instructions are not existent for the PC version.

[Edit to Review]: Scanning a new face can be done in MyCareer for the player that was built. So, I was mistaken on this, thankfully.
2. It made a silly looking version of me. If I could've made some minor tweaks to the eye tilt, the chin size, it would've been alright. But, there were no such touch-up options. Your stuck with only the software's interpretation.

[Edit to Review]: This was corrected by rescanning my face while filling up more of the circle. So much so, that when I turn my head, my child goes out of the rotation. I look much closer to normal now.
3. BIGGEST ISSUE FOR ME: The game only allows a single person's face to be scanned in. I bought this hoping to scan in the face of my friends and family and build a custom team with all of us and enter an offline MyLeague with it. Frankly, I will never buy NBA 2K again until this feature exists. I simply don't understand why the face scan isn't built into the Create-A-Player. If anyone has a hack around this, let me know.
4. Not a big deal, but still a problem: MyPlayer should allow users to decide whether or not they want to max out the players. I wouldn't do that, but real superstars come into the league with ratings in the 80-90s. Start with some limited default, but allow users the freedom to override it. Different aspects of MyCareer are attractive to different users. Grinding from nobody just isn't fun for me.
[Edit to Review]: You can boost your ratings really quickly, if you're willing to pay a lot of money. Obnoxious and not worth it. Still a negative for me.
5. Here's another huge negative for me now that I've played a little: they still haven't provided a way to turn off the cheerleaders. I hate having this indecency in the game and want the option to turn it off. I've reported this in prior versions, and hoped that after 6 years they would've provided this ability in the graphics settings. They just don't seem to care that they're keeping customers away who are offended by this.

If anyone has help, please provide it. For those of you playing an older version simply looking for what I was looking for, be content with what you have and don't waste your time. Just keep playing MyLeague on the version where you've invested so much time.

I was afraid not to buy this game for bad comments but i have said what the hell i will buy it.
I do not have problems with crashes for 3.5 hours, all went well.
My Configuration is Amd Ryzen 5 2400g, rx590 8gb, 16 gb ram, ain""t super gaming rig but it is all right.
My advice is if you are interested for buying another game this is quite good and tense game especially for the last seconds where you can lose the game.
The flaws of this game are some defined which i am going to write down.
1 - My career mode is extremely slow and basically you have to pay for upgrades if you want to upgrade fast, otherwise you will have to grind a lot  of time to be a good player with good statistic because it is expensive.
2 - Other players in my career mode are sometimes glitched to hold the ball too much time and you are loosing the attack, and as well the story is quite good and interest but after couple of hours it gets a boring for me at least, it does not have to be boring for you, do not wanna spoil things here.
And that is all, overall this game is good for just substitute some other games for an example i am taking rest from call of duty and wanna change the genre completely, some glitches i did not have but for now it is all great.
My opinion is this is just a game so do not expect the perfection because after all it is just a game, ain""t a real life.
As i said upon for me works properly enough and do not have crashes. or any kind of fps drop.
For the closure this game is just fine and the most important thing buy it on the discount, never pay full price because game does not have too much things for 60 euros, i do not know how much exactly it costs but for the price below 10 euros is great.

I personally would not pay for it at full price, but that's just because I'm a filthy casual and not really a hardcore gamer.  I only play MyCareer on the 2K games with one player and then pretty much stop playing a few years into the career.  2K really is a grind, and I really only play to blow off steam.  But that's on me and not the fault of the game devs.

Too many reviews give too little credit to how much actually goes into producing a game like this, and expect new bells and whistles every release over incremental changes to critical things like the physics engine.  A telling sign that most of the negative reviews are just people who don't actually understand the game development process and are just being petulant is the fact that they all keep buying 2K every year and have hundreds of hours played.

I can definitely understand the frustration of paying $60 + however else much you pay to buy VC's to upgrade your character every single year for a product that appears to have only incremental (if at all) improvements.  But the solution isn't to shit on the developer.  It's to just...not buy the game until its on sale.

1. if you like basketball and want to keep your hair at the same time DO NOT pick this up

2.the shooting mechanics are awful even if you line up a shot perfectly the game will turn around and say NOPE even when you are wide open and If you think you are going to win everyone just starts fouling out of the blue. 

3. I get that most games these days make there money in microtransactions but in a dame this is bad I would say you need spend at least another 50-80 bucks to make your character worth anything.

EDIT: After experiencing a little more, you automatically ""attend"" events for the endorsements, so none of those cool Beats events with cutscenes. Still no agent meeting cutscenes, just pickup VC from the front door.

1- Starting cutscenes of every game. Player behaviours, team mascots, the crowd, Commentaries of announcers.
2- The tweets which are in-game and off-game from the crowd/fans. Same as 2k20.
3- The whole commentary of the games, copy-pasted.
4- Team Practices. Same.
5- Cpu-player movements (NPCs) are the same. The interactions between themselves in-game. Defense and offense movements, the playbooks they use, same...
6- The endorsement offers. They disabled the cutscenes. The offers are the same, copy-pasted.
7- The shoe creating or editing. Same.
8- Neighbourhood. Same. Nothing except from how it looks is changed.
9- The moves you pull in-game, park or nba-on-court, SAME.
10- VC rewarding system :) every bit of it is the same.
11- Character creation, every bit of code is the same.
12- ""Setting up your potential"" copy-pasted. Every part of it.
13- I didn't win a championship but I am guessing if you do, the resulting cutscenes are probably the same. Maybe they fixed the No-Sound issue :) I doubt it.
14- In myCareer; ""My Minutes"", ""My Stats"", ""Team Stats"", ""Player Stats"" all the menus are the same. I don't know how they could've changed them though, but still, seeing the same font in everything :) kinda funny.
15- The Progression menu. Exactly the same. Badges too. Nothing is changed.
16- From what I've heard, the park is the same too. All of the items you can buy, Daily-Spin, cheaters too, they are all the same.

----- These are the ones 11 hours of gameplay showed me. Now let's look at the pros :)

1- The game is smoother, no fps drops with gtx 1060 16gb RAM, i7 7700K and installed on an SSD.
2- The bug where you had to alt+tab to fast-forward to sub-in to the game, is gone. They fixed it finally. Now after you sub out, you just press Space and it works.
3- The discount was good :) 8 dolars is a good price for an update for the 2k20.

This game is nowhere near deserving the $50 or more. They just used ""ctrl+A"" then ""ctrl-V"". Then they used ""ctrl-F"" to find the cutscenes and deleted them. Nothing more believe me. These companies are getting bold to present such games with such prices.

if there is a discount and a really good one, sure buy it. It's fun. But no more than $8.",1620383549,1620383549,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So instead, on harder difficulties they make every opposing player a blend of LeBron, Curry and Giannis, and every player on my team, even star players who are amazing IRL, a mindless donkey. I wouldn't even mind the opposing team scoring EVERY TIME if my team at least TRIED to defend. They don't. The opponent seems to literally just run into the paint and score over my C every time. Or get fouled. Or both. That's fine. What isn't fine is Nikola Vucevic and Zach LaVine averaging 13 FG% on the goddamn season. It absolutely doesn't matter how open any of my teammates are. They WILL miss. The times they score is when they are absolutely open in the paint and the game mechanics literally don't allow them to miss. If this is the idea of making the game more DIFFICULT, then the standards are at an all time low when it comes to making a good game. The worst part is that people will defend this and say ""gEt gOoD"". (People seem to confuse ""difficult"" with ""completely BS"") I score 60+ points every match, and even then it's not a sure win. First of all I don't want to have to score that much every time, it kills realism. If I switch to an easier difficulty, I will win every game by 50+. I don't want that either. I want a good challenge that is also fair. Can't have that with this game.

However they are NOT updating this version to the ""Next Gen"" version so you will not be getting anything other then what's here already. They don't seem to have any plans to release the Next Gen version either.

Though a VERY sore spot for me is ALL of my files got ""corrupted"" and wiped. I lost a TON of MP progress & earned VC because of that. Even after making a help ticket all I got was a wordy professionally written ""oh well"".

Because of that, I can't recommend the game.

In short, if you want a multiplayer, online, competative, balanced basketball experience, do NOT pick this up.
If you want to play the next gen version of the game, do NOT pick this up, maybe next year.

But if you want to just either make your own player, grind your way up through the NBA, and ignore the multiplayer component, it's not half bad, it's okay. It's even okay if you go into the MyTeam mode of PC, so long as you stick to the single player mode, since the currency, MT, is way easier to obtain and the cards seem to go for cheaper based on what I've seen in the PS5/4 market.

But still expect the overall feeling from the devs that they just don't care, this especially is true if you played previous years, where the more immersive side of the game was sort of expected to be there, making them stick out with their omission. Things like adding shoes as the season goes on (they heavily push other clothes for mp only though) your mycareer character interacting with other nba stars on the regular, the pregame show featuring Shaq. 

It all manages to feel barebones, but typically during this time of year I see this title for $20 or less, which if you are new I think is worth it, sink your hours to it, then maybe see if next year's version improves or not. That being said, always expect multiplayer to be trash on PC, not to mention one of the more toxic communities I've ever witnessed.

I'll just stick to single player myteam thank you very much.",1616712495,1616712573,False,66,4,0.805110812187194824,0,True,False,False

The game 2K21 is fun. It's very fun. I play the MyPlayer and Park mode exclusively. It's very fun. I like leveling up my, MyPlayer, and working on him for wins and eternal glory.

But heres the shit part, about 95% of time time, I'm dealing with a problem that this game has. The servers crash, the servers are bugged and I'm frozen and need to restart. There are hackers on every other court, making the game impossible for new people, and extremely difficult and unfun for the veterans of the park. 
It's so annoying how a HUGE game like 2K, that just gets SLAMMED with money from VC, can't update and fix their game. It's astonishing. 
If more people would subject themselves to this form of torture, there would be a GoFundMe page right now for the developers, so they can be paid to fix this shit.
Honestly, if 2K was ran and designed by an honest to good company. This would be one of the, if not THE best sports game on the market. But when it's better then Madden (Not saying much) and there is no other equal or close competitor to 2K... You have to just suck it up or pass it up.

Took me over an hour to get the game to work. Was a nightmare to troubleshoot and honestly not sure what fixed it. Had a patch that was stuck at zero the moment the game booted and could not play until it was done. 

Online is terrible, empty compared to console and full of cheaters.

I bought it looking for an offline experience for mycareer/mygm, first time since '18. Once I got the game working, it has been smooth as butter and I haven't really had any glitches aside from one practice drill bugging out. 

MyGM seems a bit watered down compared to what I remember, but it has been years so I could be wrong. Not a fan of the new AP system they use.

MyCareer seems to be a pretty big improvement from what I remember. Grind is still really bad. Story is still bad but is a lot better than 16/17/18 and there are far less cutscenes.

SAVE YOUR MONEY! This game is unplayable, I have a high end PC and this $h!tty game keeps crashing. I've yet to finish a game. Don't even get me started on the MyPark side of things. They should call it MyCrashedComputer. On top of that you have to re-install the whole game every time you get an update and it takes forever. Go and get yourself a console or something if you wanna play it. Don't get the PC version. I love NBA 2k games been playing them since 2k5 with Ben Wallace on the cover and this is the worst experience I've had with the franchise.

Although this game had so many negative reviews, i still bought it. Many people say that it has so many bugs, online servers are trash, do not buy this game. And i 30% agree. It does not have THAT many bugs that people said, like i only encountered 2 or 3 in OFFLINE game. It does not have THAT shitty server that people are saying. Some say that it is laggy, some say that i have latency delay, some say that it crashes during online play and etc. Me, personally have not encountered any of these problems. BUT problem is that if you live in a shitty region like me (Georgia) your ping might be high, that's all, and i play on 75hz monitor but sometimes in the Neighborhood or online 5v5 it caps at 60hz. idk why but still, it's not trash game and if you want to buy it, i recommend you to buy it on a sale. i've bought it 10$ on sale and i am pleased with it.",1616264350,1616264350,True,5,2,0.509613394737243652,1,True,False,False

- Story of career mode is very good. Videos & telling is nice.
- Game seems to be stable no crashings so far, not like 2k20 where at least one crash on 1 hour playingtime is normal.
- Streetbasketball is good playable camparing to 2k20, no or less lagging animations on court. 
- Grafik seems to be a bt better specially to colors and shadows are more reallistic and not eye destroying (too dark, too bride) like in nba 2k20.
- NO HELI and no other noisy sound on court to let your cry or rip of your headphones!!!

Negativ:
- Comparing to 2k20 the career mode is destroying the game now. Pick & roles or other playbooks are not possible to execute now, because defender is so fast he can avoid the screen 100% and other obstacles easy. But your own teamplayers are screening you %100 and slow you down by bumping you around in defence. 
- All attack action seems to be random & lucky. Your defender is allways in front of you no matter what, no fake moves are working agaist npc defender even with eurostep you can not loose your very fast npc defender. Movment of npc defenders looking very unrealistic too fast and overdrived.
- npc are fouling a lot more than in 2k20. Most of the game you do freeshots - make it boring!!!
- gameplay seems pre scripted. If game decide your not getting ther rebound/ball you dont even if u stand beside it clearly nearest to it. The npc gets ball even far away from it.
In one word stupid NPC with no AI just scripted moves and position is not relevant for getting the ball.

Finally:
I recomment playing career mode in 2k20 if and neighbourhood in 2k21.
But buying this game isnt worth it. Like in 2k20 cheaters are destroying the game fun in neighbourhood. 
2k is not reallising that those cheaters destroying the image of nba 2k. Dont wanna buy nba 2k games anymore. Cant recomment buying it!!!!",1613499786,1616072140,False,3,0,0.555302202701568604,0,True,False,False

I don't think it's a hardware problem because my actual components didn't break a sweat running the application,  leading me to the conclusion that it's an issue with the stability of the PC port itself.

It's scary actually how good and realistic that engine is; however, for the PC it's ass.  Yes, I realize I have played quite a bit of this writing a ""not recommended"" to get.  

This is only because of 2 things: as others have pointed out, PC users were shafted for the next gen jump.  Oh well, it's still the best steam has to offer.  But secondly and even more importantly, this game has so many annoying crashes. 

I play 2k21 for its MyLeague feature for 90% of my game played time and I can't tell you how often I have to save because the game just continues to crash even after I try everything to fix the issue like clear the cache, turning V-Sync on and off, etc.  It's random and will continue to happen until 2k addresses the issue which if we go back to my first point, you'll get your answer. 

I had no problem playing this game on any other mode with crashes.  Although I did experience a really flawed bug when on MyCareer.  If you have VSync off, you can't simulate to your next appearance.   

Get this hesitantly or when it's on sale. 

If the game wasn't broken/buggy: 8/10
but because it's a re-hash of 2k18-20 AND there's near game breaking bugs, 4/10

now excuse me as I bot this game up for the 8th time today

I find the fact my brother was banned for quitting yet as said player with the handle IM N****R who was using cheating software to not allow us to even play the game if we wanted to. 

The message EA, 2K sports and take-two interactive are telling us is that is it okay for IM N****R to buy cheating software, so may behave as they please. These companies are saying it is okay to be racist and devalue human life. Because they clearly reward his behavior while I am punished for speaking out against this injustice. Rewarding this sickening behavior is spitting in the face of all those who of supported this company since it's conception and I refuse to be support these companies any longer.

On PlayStation the network is so terrible that the lag on my internet 600 hard wired set up I cannot play a match due to getting 15-20 FPS on my 4k 65 inch tv. Ultimately EA/2K or whoever it is running the show thinks it is acceptable for racism and bigotry to exist within their community.

 ***They do not have any kind of report/player feedback portal and or any anti cheat system in place to protect paying customers that actually take the time and enjoy their product.***

It is unfortunate that such a gem is diminished by the developer's total and utter disregard for customer loyalty and satisfaction, server maintenance, matchmaking systems, anti-cheat (in a community riddled with cheating players), and ultimately believes it is both appropriate and acceptable for players in the community to be overtly racially derogatory and outright sick. 

What a shame...

Either people on here have faulty pc's, hate just for pure pleasure, or simply they're talking about past problems. I consider myself lucky if that is the case, because I am having an absolute blast. My pc is kicking this game's butt, I have pretty much transformed this game to NBA 2K21 next gen. The modding community is amazing. Even without mods this game looks beautiful. I've read some reviews on where people say shooting in this game is bad/hard, that's funny, shooting in this game is not only easy but easy to master as well. Learn the game, and stop shooting like crazy. Remember, don't expect Shaq to hit a 3, if that's what you're trying to do LOL I havent played an NBA game since NBA 2K7, considered by most, THE BEST, NBA 2K game, and I must say, I enjoyed the heck out of NBA2K7, BUT, this game right here, its something else. Call me bootlicker or whatever, but 2K have out done themselves with this title. That being said, a game with more negative reviews than positive reviews, doesn't always mean is a BAD game, at least on my end. Good thing I didn't let negative reviews make my decision on whether buying this game or not. 

PS: I've played WNBA league, MyTeam, and I have not experienced a single crash. I've read some reviews stating this game crashes on launch, and I have 6hrs in the time of this review, and does 6hrs have been of pure joy and entertainment.

All 2k cares about is money these kind spend on their Myplayers and MyTeam, or whatever it is called. The actual product is going downhill and people who are fans of the NBA, true fans are leaving. I have seen this before, when EA killed their NBA games by not giving a crap about the product. 
I am very dissapointed, because what drew me to 2K was that they cared about customers more than money, which not true anymore, and it is so apparent. 
I am not even going to mention the invisible players glitch, which makes the game unplayable to me.
This game is dead to me, which is a shame, because I have spent so many years with 2k and still love the actual game of basketball.

I love the idea of MyTeam and it's what I've been playing all these hours. Now you may be wondering, 300+ hours at the time of this review? I haven't owned 2K before so I'm making up for lost time. I'm also a sucker for grinding out things to get players and some of the players are a joy to play with. But to really have any meaningful progress in MyTeam, you'll have to play online. This is where the game goes straight into the gutters of hell.

1. Matchmaking - League of Legends has better matchmaking than this absolute garbage. I've been meaning to review this game for a while but it took me playing this guy EIGHT straight times in a row on Triple Threat Online to get me on here. I pay no money outside of the original purchase of this game. This other guy I've now somehow queued up against EIGHT STRAIGHT TIMES? He/She clearly has poured some money into this game like 99% of the PC players who play online (Pink Diamond players). Does 2K have zero idea on matching their player base to equivalent team skill? It's absolutely ridiculous. Also, why is the lag on this game so horrible? Which brings me to my next point. 

2. Pay to Win: even though you (now) mistakenly have this game, it means nothing because you'll have to grind countless hours JUST to have an inferior team when compared to other players who play online. This ""pay to win"" issue is absolutely tragic because of the matchmaking issue above. If you ever want to experience how this is broken, let me give you some examples.
- Pink Diamond (PD) Steph Curry consistently out-rebounding my center who is actually decent (Diamond Javale McGee, Diamond Hakeem, etc). I even get into a good rebounding position and he'll just either out-rebound me or tap it out, at which point your ""inferior"" players will just struggle.
- Your ""great"" defensive player who consistently get blown by when staring across a higher rated player. 92-94 power forwards and centers consistently get dunked on by point guards launching from 8-10 feet away from the basket.
- Your amazing point guard who has the ""unpluckable"" badge will consistently cough the ball up to superior, higher rated players. I'm sorry Jason Kidd, I've never seen you cough the ball up so many times in the span of 30 seconds. 

3. Ah the last main point. This game has a steep learning curve and the ""mechanics"" of this game are just horrible. In Triple Threat especially, you can never get your teammates to do what you want. 
- No three seconds in the key. What is wrong with 2k here? Did they just forget to code this? They patch the game and make you download it almost every day. Can they not fix that?!?
- Pick and roll mechanics do not work. I will call for a fade on the PNR and they will roll EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
- Get used to every player being on skates. This is 2K on Ice baby.

There is no way I would recommend this game to someone looking to enjoy this game. All this game is good for is for is to play against friends using the standard NBA teams. If you've read this far along and wondering why I am still putting hours into this game, it's because I love the NBA and I'll suffer through this game to collect players. That last sentence reads wrong but I hope you understand what I mean. The other thing I find funny is just watching my players do these silly things. It's funny if YOUR Steph Curry out-rebounds every single player in the game, but it's just miserable having that happen to you. I once read a comment that this game is ""so realistic"" but nothing could be further from the truth. The exact thing that makes this game so laughable is that it's so unrealistic. Players shoot 40% at best from three even when they're wide open in real life, but not in 2K. If you're in a hot zone and playing against a 95+ rated player, GG. That player is unstoppable. They will instantly be on fire and your entire team will go ice cold. How demoralizing. Oh and as a ""no money spent player"" the free 95+ rated players are not the same as the 95+ rated players you get from packs. 

It's so sad to me that there isn't a competitor out there because I love basketball and I love the NBA. The game in real life deserves better a better representation and so do the fans. Justice will unlikely be granted in my lifetime but this ends my rant. Thanks for reading all the way through!

Update:
This game is still trash. There's all these broken mechanics that allow for so minimal counter play. And I swear this is no moderation on hacks because there be players greening fadeaways multiple times in a row and contested shots. Part of it is the servers. There's so much lag that it doesn't let the game have any meaningful counterplay for PC.

No. Rather than that 2k devs are too busy rolling around on the floor screaming at the ceiling because they are mentally insane.

Not only is that fundamental to NBA strategy, it's something that wasn't screwed up in other titles. How lazy do you have to be to not bother programming rotations just because eventually your player will start so - I dunno - why even bother? This is truly a shameful title. I wish I could unrecommend it even harder. This deserves some fire borders with little devil emojis doing horrible things to the 2K logo.

I'm surprised I haven't noticed before how abundantly, unforgivingly slanted this is for PVP play - and all of that feeds into the pay-to-win / microtransaction setup for this game. It turns out there are no microtransactions (outside of stat improvements) for the meat of the game - NBA play. As such, the title basically ignores the NBA. Most of the videos that play while loading the game are related to highlights from the park (or other non-NBA venues), or PVP tournaments, or which new avatar enhancement can be bought, or highlights from PVP events. Alternatively, there are entire videos dedicated to which colored jewel cards are available and how they'd be useful for PVP play.

This isn't an NBA title. This is a PVP title that needs the NBA to make it relevant. As one of the many players who couldn't care less about PVP I'm upset I have to endure all the useless nonsense spoon fed to us to try and coax money from our wallet. I wonder if there could be two basketball games - one for fans of the NBA and one for fans of blue afros and vanity Christmas sweaters. I wonder which would sell more.
 
I pick up this title annually. After bad reviews and noting it was last gen for the PC I waited for it to be $20 USD. It's still horrible. It's the worst version of this game I've played in recent memory. My expectations for it weren't even high (thanks COVID) and it still failed to meet them.

Yeah, it had a knock against it for being last gen. There's no excuse for disrespecting PC gamers. Consoles are for kids who can't afford PCs. So this is the same game as it has been for the last couple years. I play MyPlayer and MyLeague, but I haven't started the league yet.

The story was weak. What follows are spoilers, but it's hard to spoil what's barely there. The character who could but doesn't have daddy issues is perpetually compared to his high school / college star father who died somehow. You stop playing football to pursue basketball for reasons that no one says in your senior year. Your coach and not-really-mentor have beef that isn't explained. You go to college, you date a national soccer player for Canada, she leaves to pursue her dream and you go to the pros. That's basically it.

During that slog you're pretty horrible. I made a 3 & D wing who couldn't shoot (nothing new there, thanks a lot 2K). Bored with his lack of ability I switched to a two-way slasher. At least he can score. Your ratings start in the 40s (the 40s! A new low!) and with investment of earned VC they make it to 50 to 60. Then, at a 65-ish rating (artificially buffed, none of your scores are 65) you enter the pros as the second pick in the draft.  Normally I'd grind the league for a bit to buff my player with earned VC but this year I just wanted to play basketball. If you skip the story you start at a 60 rating with no badges.

I get on my favorite RL team and it doesn't play at all like the real team. It doesn't run any offense - again nothing new, the game still wants you to call the plays. As such, my RL rookie-of-the-year contender doesn't use his should-be gold rated floater because the offense is stagnant. Two guys on the block, two guys at the top and you. No movement. One screen per possession unless you call them. So yeah, my favorite team got disrespected by 2K.

You might assume that's a thing across the league, right? That every team was short changed? Wrong. Brooklyn has its super team - based on a trade made after release in January. So 2K, thirsty for love from casual fans, catered to bandwagon players by forcing a roster change mid-season while completely ignoring how actual teams failed to live up to their RL counterparts. That's pretty bad 2K. It gets plenty of money from this title, it doesn't have to release trash.

I forgot to complain about how your character spawns next to the PVP courts and has to jog to the team facility every time if he (or she? Maybe?) wants to practice with the team and get better. It takes maybe 30 seconds to run there. So over an 80 game season that's 40 minutes wasted.

1) lay it up quickly or dunk
2) get commando blocked from the away team's center who was looking the other way, is flat footed, and should be slow as shit.

If you thought number 2 happened, you're right!

That wasn't a one off, either. Stuff like that happens constantly. It feels like they tried to make the game ""harder"" by making involve more arcade elements versus actually trying to make the AI smarter. The court feels small.

Honestly, I have no idea how they made the game worse. I never play online because the servers are trash, and I usually go to bat for this game because the offline gameplay is great, but this is just bad. Between the shot mechanics being worse, no matter if you have the ""aim"" feature off, the AI somehow being stupider, or players teleporting to others on defense, this game feels worse than the NHL series when the last console switch happened. 

Yes, it's that bad. 

I really hope 2K gets their act together. They make enough money off all the damn microtransactions they've put in the game. Maybe they don't care about the offline gamer, the mycareer and franchise gamer. They aren't on EA's level of stupidity, but they are getting close. 

They either need to start cleaning house, telling people to step it up, or just admit all they care about are the MyTeam players. 

It's not worth it at full price, it's not worth it on sale. If it was 10 bucks, I guess pick it up. 

Massive disappointment.

Many bugs include: Getting out boxed and conceding a rebound to a 6' player, when my player is a Dennis Rodman build; No NBA on TNT (Which I loved the realism this added in TV games in MyCareer; The dropstep and hookshot seem to be off, what I mean is I get blocked by Chris Paul when again, I am 6' 7'' low post scorer; No introduction to ""My City"" or whatever it's called. Overall, a terrible game. I do not even understand the logic of not putting next-gen on PC when the game is practically created....ON A PC.

For $20, I thought it would be worth a try.  I remember enjoying 2k10 & 2k11 back in the day.

I was wrong.  The reviews are right.  The PC version has multiple issues that apparently have gone unresolved for years.  If you run in the game above 60fps (which it explicitly allows), you get soft locked any time you sit on the bench.  People reported that bug for 2k20 and it was never fixed.

Outside of the issues, the blatant monetization of every aspect of the MyCareer mode frequently left me shocked.  Attempting to play without purchasing VC is a miserable experience.  Not only does your player move slow, loses the ball, misses wide open shots, but the story of the game consistently berates you for your performance.  There is nothing like grinding your way through an 1/7 FG game where the commentators are constantly talking about how Junior is a ""failed, disappointing prospect"".  Or how the game introduces a rival character that literally represents you if you had purchased VC.  Or how they introduce team practice drills that can only be completed by higher level characters.  So much of the game is about dangling nice things in front of you, and then shaking a money can in your face afterwards.

By the way, if you don't want to half-ass it and max out your MyCareer character, you would need to drop $100 on VC.  If you drop $100 on a character that isn't perfectly built, you don't get it back.  Also, VC doesn't carry over to next year.  So they literally want people to spend $100 per character, per year.  For a game that has bugs that are multiple years old.

Unfortunately, the worst of the game appears long after 2 hours have passed.  I have submitted a refund request despite, hopefully Steam will be lenient.  I feel horrible for anyone that paid full price for this.",1613596055,1613596055,False,2,0,0.54209446907043457,0,True,False,False

* It's on sale for at least 50% off
* You love basketball or have previously enjoyed 2K
* You're a PC only gamer or you have an ancient Xbox One, and don't want to buy a new console to play next gen (like me)
* You don't plan on buying this game solely for multiplayer purposes (the player base is nothing like console)

Otherwise, it is just not worth it. 2K is an incredibly greedy company that knows they're the only basketball game in town, and capitalize on their younger player base on pay to win bull****. The PC version is not well optimized, though it is playable, and I have to say, playing at 155hz instead of 60 is nice. But that is the only benefit of the PC version. For example, in MyCareer, when you're in a game on the bench you have to alt+tab several times for the ""sim to next appearance"" option to work. 

If it's on sale, and you know you'll play it casually, it's probably worth it. But I'm conflicted still on giving 2K any of my money.

FYI - The Steam(PC) version has less content than the next gen machines - which is bunk since PC has better tech - however console players spend more $$$ on VC. So IF I buy it again, I'll always wait for a sale since 2K doesn't care about PC users anymore.

As for the game, I ONLY play MyCareer. It's a decent story, too bad it's stripped down and there's no choice of college or G-league, or any other cut scenes to make it a story after you get drafted.

This game is abysmal. Every issue 2k has ever had is all culminated into this one masterpiece of absolute awfulness. The AI acts like semi-smart actual basketball players while your Javale McGee will sit in the corner and refuse to move until he shoots 18 3's a game. The defense is unplayable and clunky and feels worse than any 2k i have ever played. The shooting is awful, so bad that you can miss an open shot from right under the basket. Nothing in this game feels good. MyTeam is awful because all the cards are overpriced so unless you actually dump money into the game, you spend hours grinding for one card then restart to get another card, just to get an OK starting core. All the actual human players in MyTeam abuse the same cheese and the game is just not remotely fun unless you can actually play with friends you know who aren't scumbags. MyCareer is an endless grind, and is utterly abysmal since unless you want to focus only on defense or only on scoring, you are a useless sack of meat on the court since all your teammates don't know how to play basketball. And on defense, you have to play defense 1v5 because the AI wants to permanently switch and also no matter what position you are, you will eventually be assigned to defend the point guard which is absolutely retarded when you try to make a paint beast like Shaq and expect him to lockdown Luka or Trae Young on the perimeter. Also, the game permanently makes you foul or fouls you so the gameplay feels incredibly choppy at every point and then on top of that, about 30% of the free throws you take have a broken camera where you can't see the player. I'm sure I missed other things in this game that have made me upset, but the moral of the story is this game has absolutely no upside and there is no reason to buy it unless you plan on playing with friends, because that is the only thing I have found even remotely enjoyable in this game. Please dear god 2k FIX YOUR DAMN GAME IT'S BEEN BROKEN FOR OVER 5 YEARS

Edit: On top of all this, now the AI won't even play the game correctly and the NBA players all act like baby colts learning how to walk on ice. They sprint past their personnel they're supposed to guard and then always leave the offense wide open. Shooting is abysmal still because the shot meter is invisible and apparently ratings and badges can't save anyone anymore. I don't think 2k devs have ever been outside and experienced physics, let alone played a second basketball in their lives. It's just honestly sad to see this portrayal of pro athletes. At least Madden, which has its issues, still feels like playing football. This just feels awful and sad and frustrating and honestly I don't think there is a single reason to purchase this game. Literally none. It's just 2k20 but even worse somehow, which I didn't know was possible. Honest to god, this game is, bar none, the worst video game I have ever played in my entire life and should never have been released.",1612979386,1613144054,False,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False

Every year, I tell myself ""I will never fork over another dollar (or $60, in fact) to 2K for what is basically a roster update."" But every year, I find myself purchasing this forbidden fruit and, unfortunately, this year was no exception.

To all those out there that hear that every year, 2K releases the same basketball game. This CANNOT be overstated. When the NBA2K developers pool their collective 4 brain cells to make the new game, I'm virtually certain that the only change they can pull out of their asses is something to the shot timing mechanic. Otherwise, you can expect a user interface with identical functionality, but with a different color scheme and design. That about sums up the changes every year. Oops, and a little roster update too. That's it! 2K is consistently charging us another $60 for the same game!

But wait, it's not over. As a cherry on top of this horse-shit sundae, 2K puts 0 effort into releasing a playable game. Plain and simple: the game is UNPLAYABLE. A year after the release of 2K20, I was still experiencing game-crashing bugs in the middle of matches on a regular basis. There is no reason why a game with this much funding, and this much notoriety, should be plagued with bugs for THIS LONG. These games have been produced since before I was born, yet they can't get rid of these experience-ruining bugs every year. And today, much to my dismay, as I opened the brand-spanking new NBA2K21 to play my first game, I immediately crash before I could even get to see Kyle Lowry's thick, juicy behind with 2K's ""next-gen graphics.""

You, the reader, may be asking: how can 2K be putting out shitty games every year but millions of people still buy them? Because. They. Can. Afford. To... 2K essentially has a monopoly on basketball games, meaning if someone wants a basketball game (which A LOT of people do), they HAVE to turn to 2K. Now, 2K has two options:

1. Go the benevolent route. Use the money into developing a game that isn't ridden with the aforementioned issues that make it downright unplayable at times. Or...

2. Put out doodoo butter and reap the profits because people will buy the game anyway.

Unfortunately, they went with the latter, and now we're here where we are today. 2K developers have shown no interest in giving us a good game. They mask the problems with the promise of ""better graphics,"" but in reality it doesn't matter how good your graphics are if your users can't actually get into a game. I hope one of these days, some competitors show up in the basketball games scene to get them off their asses so that 2K can stay afloat and genuinely improve their game. Godspeed, 2K.

See you next year bitches.

update 2/9/2021:

mycareer is as garbage as last year. once your player starts putting up big numbers the AI instantly resorts to constant double-teaming and is not letting me play the game. my 74 overall point guard is constantly getting 20+ assists a game by just passing off of double teams.

mypark is a constant battle of snatch back upon snatch back until you get a desired animation into a shot that goes in if you get the timing right, regardless of your 3pt rating. defense is whack too, its basically pressing the steal button until you either foul or get the steal, which WILL happen even if your steal rating isnt high at all. its a far cry from the desired effect of having players specialize in 1 or 2 aspects, not to mention the lag issues and constant crashes in the pc version.

the only redeemable game mode in this game are the offline modes, which is what i play a lot of (play now, blacktop, myleague/mygm), but at full price, its not worth it. my initial review still stands (buy only if on sale), but also if you're only interested in the game for the online modes, then you're going to be extremely disappointed.",1612589524,1612844980,False,7,1,0.54845815896987915,0,True,False,False

Bought this game since I have NBA 2k16, and wanted an updated experience. Saw that it was on sale, and read lots and lots of negative comments. I played it on my buddy's ps5, and thought it looked half decent besides micro-transactions so I got it. 

This game is TERRIBLY optimized for pc. Sure, it runs great on console, but pc is whole different story. When booting up it was set to 720 fps, and that's a no-go for me. I went to the settings and set everything to how I thought would be decent. (Medium to everything basically, low crowd, media, and hair, with 2x anti aliasing and at 1080p. I thought it should be able to push around 60 fps smoothly at least at those settings, since I have an i7 10th gen and a 2070 with 16 GB of RAM. 

That was not the case. The game ran at around 20 FPS in the menu, and ran the same in game. 2k16 ran at easily 80 FPS with high setting on everything, which granted its an older game so it's easier to run. I then set all the settings to the absolute lowest settings. Ran at 26 FPS. Very poor overall when I have a laptop that's able to run any modern game other than this at 60 FPS with high-ultra settings. 

Also, using up a controller with this game? Cheeks. It has ""B"" set to the advance button in the menus? This isn't a ps2 game. Everyone uses ""A"" to advance through stuff. Also using ""X"" to go back in the menus is very funky. You have to go through every setting of controller support to get it to work right, and nothing is automatically bound for a Xbox controller. Makes no sense to me at all. 

After spending so much time tweaking with settings to get the game to maybe run decent with no good result and 26 minutes of game play, I can thoroughly say that this game is terrible. No matter if it was on sale for 20 bucks, not worth it at all to me. Maybe if they fix how the game runs on pc I would be interested again.",1612688204,1612688204,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Shooting - Its kinda cool they tried to bring back shot aiming but its so heavily inaccurate and hard to align to where even the simplest of layups and wide open shots miss so frequently. You're better off playing with the shot meter off.

Movement - I feel like I get stuck when I move and my character act like he can't stop once he starts running. Also body blocking is a huge issue when it comes to defense as your teammates more often than not hold you back if you're a perimeter defender. Especially in my career. You have to change your whole route if you don't want to get stuck between 2 players.

Aesthetics - Its an upgrade but not that huge of a leap. The main upgrade is the detail in the facial hair. And it wouldn't be a 2k game if the facescans weren't bad cause oh boy I still can't get mine to look right.

My Career - One of the most unfun experiences I've played from a 60 overall. You cannot score unless its off of a fast break and you are unable to access neighborhood until you complete all the college games. If you skip midway through then you of course lose that salary but its probably worth it as its not much of a difference being 500 if you skip and 600 if you don't skip.

1225330,86025816,76561198236356804,60,2,101,0,101,1612553756,"I think the best way to do this is a pro and con list:

Pros
- Hard foul animations are actually pretty good
- Transition fouls are more realistic to the nba game, they're hard and prevent the layup and are pretty common in a 1 v 1 fastbreak
- Players under the rim are fairly contested, in previous 2ks they could kind of just shoot layups with a lean and it would seem uncontested, this makes offence rebounds and put-backs more realistic

Cons
- Transition defence is completely broken. If you miss a shot, there's a very good chance they can just throw a full court pass for an open layup. This happened to me literally up to half of my missed shots being uncontested fast breaks. Even if you do have a defender back, the controls are so clunky that if you're not perfectly placed (which is luck because where they start is based on the computer) you can't even contest players, let alone stop them.

-Play calling: Often you will call a play and it simply just won't happen. The player will set a screen nowhere near your man, or just not at all. Half the time they do set an off ball screen (so CPU controlled) it's an illegal screen, which you can do nothing about. For some reason they added an extra button to call plays which is just bad for quality of life, such as late shot clock situations, wanting a screen from a specific player etc.

- Defence is incredibly clunky and players are very slow to change direction. When quick player gets by (which obviously happens irl so that's not an issue in itself) there is no help defence at all or two defenders will come and it's just an easy bucket. On screens the CPU will often make a dumb play, like double a non 3 point shooter, switch into a terrible mismatch, or just let the roller have an open layup and just stand still.

- Offence Star players struggle to deal with minimal pressure at the rim if they're not locked in to one of the favourable animations. Players like Shaq struggle to finish over defenders like Iverson for example. Over a foot and 100 lbs difference and one foot from the rim it's a 50/50. Spacing is terrible. Eg. If you call for a screen on the left wing and theres someone in the left corner, they will rise to the FT line extended and then not set a screen. So you have the ball handler, the screener, and just a random dude all within a couple of feet of each other.

-Servers - Still broken. Playable, but expect 2 second freezes up to 5 times a minute. Disconnects also once in a while.

Finally - why is this not the next gen version on PC? PC has much higher capacity for graphics than a console, so there is no reason why 2k should not have released the next gen version here. The gameplay and this lead me to the conclusion that 2k simply will not make fundamentally sound changes to their game, even if they are essential for a good basketball game until people stop buying it. I hope that there is some competition from other companies in the future.

However, the matching systems are horrible for MyCareer, you will never get into a Rec game without a full squad. Also the game can just be buggy when it comes to squading up with friends in general. Ive had to restart the game multiple times when trying to squad up with friends because the server will just randomly disconnect and put you in limbo.

It's a good game all things considered, the grind isnt really all that bad, if you really cheese the your mycareer you wont ever need to buy VC to get a maxed out player in around ~50 hours. Also maxing out other builds will be way fast after youve finished your first season with your main build.

I've played this game for 3 hours straight and have ran into more animation bugs and weird nonsense than my entire time playing 2k20 and even 2k19 for that matter. The positives are, yes its a 2k game so they do have player specific animations and tendencies and roster updates, which is awesome. However I remember always playing 2k games and just simply enjoying the game. Playing a basketball game that looks realistic as if it was an actual broadcast. Well that's just not possible in 2k21 because the immersion gets ruined by speedy, glitchy, stupid animation bugs.

Copy paste game from last year. Pay to win nightmare. 
They are also not upgrading the current PC version with next gen graphics or game play. 
If this company doesn't care about you why should you care about it? 
The only thing they ever change is the one thing no one ever asks to be changed, aka. the shot meter. 
I miss the old 2K because the 2K for the last couple of years is no different than EA. And its a damn shame. 
I don't ever say this but just pirate the game if you're just going to play season mode. 
MyTeam is pay to win as is MyCareer. Tons of hacking in online play. The only thing you can really play is season mode and its no different than last years version. 
This will be the last purchase I ever make from 2K until things change I will not be supporting this company in the future.

Update: After playing this stupid frustrating game for 600 hours I can safely say that this is by far the worst and most maddening experience I have ever had with a video game.

It's fun, as basketball is fun, and it is even better when I play with my friends. When I play with my friends, on MyCareer or just online games against them, I would never want to replace that, despite the criticisms. But, there are just so many I have on top of the fun that keeps me from recommending the game.

For one, this is not the next gen graphics. This is the 2K that is left behind in terms of the console upgrades. There are the usual complaints of greed among 2K that I feel like I have to harp on. Everything from leveling up your MyPlayer to buying packs in MyTeam requires VC, and quite a lot of it. To me, it is just a greedy practice to charge so much for a game to also have so many roadblocks that can be hurtled with extra cash. The game feels unrealistic in so many places, and rarely gets updates to fix it. So many player's tendency's in game are wrong. There are Center's in the game that have never taken 3's in their whole career's taking 1 a game here. Some people's shot tendency is too high, others too low, and far more problems than I could realistically list here.

The man reason I really cannot recommend this to you is that half of the reason to buy NBA 2K on PC is the modding community. While there are some modders working to produce amazing content for this game, a lot of them have left this one behind, or stayed behind in 2K20, because of how this console is last gen. The main reason I bough 2K20 was for the mods. Roster updates, classic teams, graphical enhancements and more. The modders out there work diligently to make for 2K's shortcomings in this game, and the base here is just lacking compared to last year.

Honestly, if you're looking to buy one of these basketball games, please just go buy 2K20 when it goes on sale. You can update the roster, and enjoy yourself with so many amazing mods to enhance your experience. As for this game, I just can't bring myself to recommend it. 5/10",1611645685,1611645685,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

People play 2k because, well, they've monopolize the basketball game. I mean, what other options do you have if you want to play a realistic-ish basketball game? NBA Live is no more, and there is pretty much no other game left.

Pros:
1. The MyLeague is a rather enjoyable mode. If you like sims, its a pretty fun sim game.
2. Very decent graphics, for shoes. Every year, they advertise how realistic the shoes are for this game. And yeah, they are pretty damn great looking.
3. The LiveOps of MyTeam is actually pretty decent.


Cons:
1. 2K can make ultra realistic looking shoes. But the models in MyPlayer is just flat out trash. Most of the props in MyPlayer mode are made up of low polygons with badly made textures. I've made way better models in my university class. Oh, and I'm sure a lot of the prop models haven't been updated since like 2k15.
2. The internet connection is just flat out trash. In this day and age where online games is a norm, 2K still manage to provide an online game with an input lag of at least 1~2 second. Oh, and, it's been like this since when the MyPark first release, a couple years ago, with no improvements.
3. AI. For people who complaints about the AI in syberpunk, well, they haven't player 2k21 yet.
4. Bugs. You think syberpunk is buggy and glitchy and unplayable? Try 2k21.
5. Features like MyPlayer and MyTeam is a bloody grind. If you are a casual player who won't pay for microtransactions, well, you won't enjoy it as much as those who's willing to pay.

A lot of the issues that people have with the game, like horrible prop models, horrible AI, ridiculous connection, grind or pay extra, and so so so much more, are not just 2k21 specific. Players have been complaining about these issues for years. And apparently, if you've monopolize the market, these issues are of no concern.

Conclusion:
You are gonna hate it, say it's trash, and write a negative review on it. But at the end of the day, you're likely still going to play it, because, what other option do you have for a NBA basketball game?",1611241058,1611241058,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

EDIT: I have since gained 152 more hours on this game and here's what I think since then. The game crashes a lot less although it is still what I would call frequent. 2k doesn't care AT ALL about PC users. If you'd like to play in the park, there are hackers everywhere who are impossible to beat with the exception of some bad ones. The game is just not consistent and I would say that if you wanna buy this game for the park, don't even consider it once.

- Gameplay can be fun, i mean its basically the same game since forever and basketball was popular before this game came along so no real points there.
- Limted mode is a good idea and stops the 5 out, curry sliding cheesers from dominating.
- Unlimited mode is fun..... if you can connect.

Cons:
Bugs:  omfg there are so so many bugs and for a game that costs $80 AND requires more $$$ to play it's a DISGRACE. They literally brake the game with every update.
Losing your XP progress, not getting correct challenges ticked off and
the most recent one is the game freezing on 70% loading ... then you take a loss, lose contracts and shoes...smh.

Servers: again omfg. The servers are TERRIBLE and that's if you can even get a match and the game doesn't crash?

Player base:  Its very very small, and in additon becuase of the cheaters even less play online unless they have to for their ""grind"" xp.

Cheaters : There are so many cheaters that use a script to crash the game when they are losing making you lose your win, progress and items you used , crash games on loading, using modded controllers, you name it. 

If you;re someone who cheats seriously GO f*** yourself.

The way 2k treats its player base is something to behold, in a bad way.

Overall i still play the game because i like basketball, if a serious contender came along at double the price and looked after its customers Id happily never play this game again.
