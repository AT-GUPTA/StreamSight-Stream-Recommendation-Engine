My mom is 76 years old. She wanted to play Zelda (after watching me play), but the combat was too difficult. I'd tried to get her hooked on games like Minecraft and Vintage Story, but... those games still have too much in terms of combat or complex survival mechanisms. Then, at some point in time, I got her Animal Crossing. HUGE hit! Unfortunately, she's had probably 10+ islands and has grown very bored with the game.

Fast-forward by about a decade, and here she is, loving the absolute crap out of Dinkum! Logged 24 hours in the first two days she played! 

Dinkum is great because: 
- the simple graphics, large icons, high contrast colors, and crisp sounds make it easy for you to see and hear what you're doing. It's great for the older players (like my mom!), but also for us who are visually impaired. I have glasses, but a lot of games simply make their UIs too small. 
- combat is present, but largely optional! For the longest time, my mom was scared to go out at night because she didn't want to get ""killed"" by scary things like tarantulas (flashback to ACNH!). But in Dinkum, a lot of the enemies can be avoided! Crocodiles can be outrun, wary mus lose interest, and even bush devils can be avoided with enough quick thinking! There are alpha animals (boss-like variants), but those can be avoided by simply not taking on their quests/staying away from their area. 
- the multiplayer is AMAZING! Seriously, 10/10. I have been the server owner for SO many games between me and my bestie (500+ miles away from me), struggling to get our games so we can play together. But Dinkum is great because it's a 2-button click and we're connected! My mom and I can play on the couch, or my bestie and I can play from our separate countries and it's the same quality, regardless! No server, no having to worry about strangers joining in, no nightmarish fiddling with the command box in windows. It's just click and play!
- the game is content-rich. It's early access, but there's a real treasure trove of stuff to do. Lots of items to build with, animals that interact with you (but also, importantly, interact with one another! Making the world feel like a living, breathing place!), clothes, character customization options, bugs and fish to collect... I could go on! 
- combat is easy, but not utterly boring. There's cues to watch for when you want to strike without getting hit back. 
- there's a selection of awesome vehicles you can get and ride around on with very fluid movement. 
- you can do it all or focus on one specific area. You can be a jack of all trades or you can focus on one task and maximize the heck out of it!

Stuff I think Dinkum could improve upon:
- for a game seemingly inspired by Animal Crossing, I'd like to see Dinkum's npcs do a bit more in the world. Change their clothes, decorate their living space (or HAVE a living area, even), catch bugs and fish, etc. 
- OPTIONAL hard mode for players who want more challenging combat
- more npc dialog/backstory
- ability to give better weapons to npcs to help you fight (when ""hanging out"")
- more animals/animal varieties 

All in all, I think the game is an absolute STEAL at the current price ($23) versus Animal Crossing which is $79 (and a lot less content). 
It's a game that brings my mom happiness at close to 80 years old, but able to be enjoyed by more ""hardcore"" gamers like myself. How cool is that? 

NOTE: My mom, specifically, would like to make a suggestion to see the days progress a bit slower. I think the pacing is alright, but a slower day wouldn't be bad, either.",1708328259,1708328259,True,15,1,0.709104597568511963,0,True,False,True

This isn't just a game; it's a virtual trip Down Under, minus the giant spiders and sunburns.

You start off with big dreams and a small patch of land, and before you know it, you're farming, fishing, and frantically running from emus. Yes, emus. Those feathery speed demons are no joke. You haven't experienced true terror until you've had a pixelated emu hot on your heels.

The animals aren't the only stars of the show; the NPCs have more personality than a kangaroo has hops. They're quirky, they're chatty, and they'll have you rolling your eyes and chuckling at their antics.

And let's talk about the crafting. Oh boy, if you love hoarding resources for that 'just in case' scenario, Dinkum will be your digital paradise. You can craft everything from a cozy hut to an empire of chicken coops. Why? Because why not!

In all seriousness, Dinkum is a charming and addictive life sim that captures the rugged beauty and whimsy of the Australian wilderness. It's the perfect game for when you want to relax, explore, and occasionally run for your life from the local wildlife.

2. some areas are way too dark for no reason at all, the sea and deep mine in particular
3. animal cages are sent separately for some reason, so you have to pick them up one by one every single day (i want to keep some mails, i do not want all of them to be deleted)

What really makes the game not as compelling and succesful in my opinion are two major problems:

1. the whole Australian setting is not appealing for most players I'm sure: the harsh and arid red is everywhere, and the land doesn't seem a welcoming and chill place to explore and settle in;

2. the characters' design is really lackluster in terms of personality: they look like bland persons without interesting traits.

Those two issues contribute to a world that isn't colorful and interesting to log in and interact; despite these two major issues, the rest is truly worth of respect IMO and the developer did a really good job.

Some pros: Fun mechanics, Easy to play with friends, you can easily lose hours to this game, super helpful ""side"" items such as the books which make things easier, so many early game food options, the ability to book mark recipes so I know what I need to grab, and the fact that you don't pass out when it's late.

Some cons: Its really tedious/difficult to level up farming, the fishing mini-game has a delay that makes it nearly impossible to play with only a mouse (I use my touch pad and it works great), some of the money scaling is a bit far-fetched, and the dirt/ground movement/placement is super annoying especially if you're into terraforming. 

Some things I wish it had: More player customization, visible milestones for further town advancement/clearer hints (so I know what I need to do next so I'm not running around hoping I just come across and do what is needed) (had this issue when it came to using the ruby shards for the mines), ability to bookmark what's needed when getting materials for building, ability to bookmark more than one recipe at a time, ability to make own furniture (even if it's just simple furniture), and more house customization.

It's hilariously ironic that the games cut scene leaves you feeling free from the grey cities clutches and then you find yourself only repeating the same mistakes as the city dwellers. Mass Tuna fishing till 500k+ dinks. 
The game makes you feel incredibly chill yet a need to being productive within the game.
and If you're able to just sit back and not get sucked too hard into the later games capitalistic approach then it continues to be a relaxed game. This game has a great atmosphere and randomly generated stunning cartoonist terrain ripe for spending 2hrs+ simply moving one hillside shovel by shovel, Never has manual labour been so relaxed.

The voxel style really sticks out to me and it makes the landscape unique, easy to change, and realistic - in a cartoony way. The vibe here is really unique and I think Dinkum is a worthy inclusion in a genre that has seen a lot of entries in recent years. I played a lot of animal crossing when it came out, and recently started a new island, but I struggle with the daily nature of things and the progress tied to real time. Animal crossing becomes such that it feels like a chore that I need to do every day. Dinkum has a lot of the charm from animal crossing (minus the animals), and many similarities, but it fixes this issue entirely by not locking the game to real time. Progress is still slow, but if you have the time to work through the days, you can keep making progress the entire time you‚Äôre sitting down for a play session. Dinkum won‚Äôt penalize you for missing a day. While it does need to be played in roughly half an hour chunks to get the most out of every day, it is a bite size piece that I‚Äôve been able to plan my gaming time around, and it works well. This game has a lot of characters, and it is always fun working towards that next villager moving in, or getting enough permit points for that new and exciting permit. 

Its systems are all competent. Fishing is unique and fun. Bug catching is almost second nature. Metal detecting is new and interesting. It is nice to wander around the forests just looking for fruit to cook, and running away from the scary lizards or Emus. Hunting is challenging but rewarding. Shoveling works realistically (at least comparatively).  Every little system here comes together as part of a greater whole. 

It is also worth mentioning that there is multiplayer support in this game, a game that‚Äôs fun on it‚Äôs own can only be more fun with your friends. I didn‚Äôt try it out, but it‚Äôs worth noting that it is there. 

As far as the farming/life sim genre goes, Dinkum is easily one of my favorites. I look forward to continuing to play days here and there, and for its eventual full release. That slow incremental progress day to day, and watching my community grow before my eyes is a truly rewarding experience. Dinkum has earned its niche in the genre.

This to me tells of a greater issue with this game - in early to mid game, there's barely and direction and no indication that what you're doing is the right thing - you just keep farming money and resources, occasionally build a new house if the right villager visits town, but the gameplay loop becomes a routine really quickly, to the point that re-starting a single day was just a dealbreaker to me.

Looking at the forums, this seems to be a common bug, and the best fix is to restart the world. With the beginning being as boring and slow as it is, I rather have a dentist's appointment than to start a new world.

My critique (so far):

- The color palette is warm and I really like that but the brightness of the colors becomes a strain on my eyes. For context, my island is still in summer and most of my playtime is in the Bushlands. The other biomes are easier on the eyes.

> Graphics: simple but also very powerful (if you take a closer look at the water for example). It has some Animal Crossing vibes but enhances on top of this. I really like the aesthetics of this game and how it looks.

> Mechanics: Sometimes the camera AND grid-based actions can be a bit annoying (shovel and wheelcart is the best example here) but mostly you can compensate this. The crafting and building, the progression and storytelling is sooo very well done! This is the main criteria that keeps me in the game. A friend of mine and I always play this game together and it keeps us wanting to play more.

> Storytelling: Yeah, some spots are a bit questionable, but if you look beyond that and let yourself get sucked into the game - it is so nice. Your village will grow, you will become more and more occupied with farming, with ""zoo keeping"" and lots more. There is so much to see and explore that it compensates the ""thin"" storytelling.

> Bugs: Well, there is a problem with saves and accountsharing (one PC, multiple accounts --> overwrites instances of your own saves) and another RAM exceeding bug (RAM consumption adds up after some time --> will probably be fixed soon) but we did not have anything else besides that. Nice, finally a feature-rich game that does NOT break if you blink a little too hard.

Overall rating: 10/10 - would buy again and I recommend this game. Feature-rich, no stupid cashgrabbing mechanics - and this is only the Early Access version. I am so thrilled for the future of this game.

Where do I see myself in this game in the future? Probably I will enhance my village even more, because until now I only built it like a drunken baboon and saw some nice Youtube videos about this game and how to make your village look astonishingly nice.",1704787743,1704787743,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

But the villagers are very weak in that game, its incredible how good the Ai of the towns folk are in Dinkum!  I terraformed around a pond so we could build a nice bridge over it thru the middle of our town.  Within a day, I had villagers wondering over the bridge and not getting stuck on it,  Amazing!!  This game is fantastic, I have only encountered minor bugs that should be ironed out in early access.  

The graphics are fantastic, game runs smooth as butter on my high end rig with 4K monitor!  

The fishing is fun, the farming is satisfying, the farm animals have personality and you even develop friends with them in a fashion!  

Really enjoy the combat mechanics, the movement is surprisingly crisp with a good weapons upgrade path, and you craft high quality food to buff yourself for tougher fights, good combination for a cozy game, but still Cozy!!

Can't say enough good stuff about Dinkum!!

A cozy game par excellence (and one that doesn't simply hide behind that adjective as an excuse for being under-developed--we're looking at you, Calico and Garden Paws), it's a bit Animal Crossing, a bit Harvest Moon, and a whole lot of Outback.

Like Stardew Valley, Dinkum is a one-man-band situation; unlike Stardew Valley, Dinkum is 3D, meaning there's a lot more to have to do to make it go. The developer, however, is clearly committed and continues to roll out new content.

In fairness and full disclosure, it is still more than a little rough around the edges, with lots of planned content still not developed at the time of this writing--it is very clearly far from ""done."" However, the diligence and attention of the developer shines through the work that is present so far, and it distinctly lacks the whiff of ""always an Early Access; never a release"" that plagues so many games of a similar origin.

I have been playing about 4 days now, and I have to say, it is a calming break from the anxiety that is monster hunter world lol. 

 Put the songs on repeat/loop. please. If I am playing for 4hrs... I would like the soundtrack constantly playing please. The silence is unnerving. Thank you :)

Other things I would like, but not needed. An auto sort button for things in inventory and box, and an all to box or out of box button, that be great!

The Game Play:
I love the childlike side to this game, with the adult responsibilities. I love that you can put poo on your head and someone actually coded a fly to show up above your head. I love the cute dresses, animals, creatures, and attention to detail on their creations. I LOVE the peacock spider! I like that you can upgrade your abilities, hunting, mining, farming, etc. 
I love that I can play with my husband, without the pressures of other people just showing up lol

The dangers in the waters and land alike, the differences between everyone's auto generated islands. Make this game something else, something different. I was weary playing this game, I really hated animal crossing by the end of my year play on that game. So I was afraid it would be too much the same, I was wrong. Its like someone played multiple of these types of games, and took a lot of the things we hated, and made it better. :) 

I love the open world! I love being able to spend a day fishing, catching bugs, doing competitions, etc... And my farm chores are done so quick, I have time. Heck, the store doesnt even open on Sundays and its not open when I first wake up in the game. 

The thing is, I like so many features of this game, and I have watched no tutorials or YouTube videos on it. So as much as I like what I have seen, I have only been playing about 4 days... Which means, there is so so so much more then I have run into yet. I know I get a mine, I know I will be able to catch animals.. But there is still so much to discover... 

Thank you for this game, I really hope for future DLC and more to it. So I can never get bored :) 
P.S. I have a completed farm together game in my library, and I have collected almost every item on animal crossing, I do know a good farm sim game when I play it. ;)",1704493242,1704506130,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The progression is great overall. To me, it doesn't suffer from the boring early setup of most survival/farming games. I do feel that some things are too easy to attain while others take too long.

Farming is not that easy because specific plants grow in specific seasons and it's  hard (for me) to keep up because I'm usually doing multiple things at once.

The only issue I've run into is when there's rocks in the water, there's no way, AFAIK, to remove them to shape the land. The only other issue is my son's game freezes but it's pretty rare.

I can't wait for the game to get updates and, hopefully, DLC.

1062520,155184681,76561198044587138,0,4,250,0,250,1704321002,"I want to like this game. I used to like Animal Crossing and I like farming sim games, so I thought this game would give me all the things that Animal Crossing doesn't... When reviews say the game is grind-y, it's GRIND-Y. If you want a slow, grind-y Animal Crossing game, then this will be perfect (as most of the reviews say). I also think this game might be meant more as a multiplayer because I can see this game being less grind-y if there's another person also collecting stuff. I'll probably have a different review if I ever end up playing this with my bf.

Some things to keep in mind when playing this game (DO NOT READ IF you don't want anything spoiled):
[spoiler]- The start is random and the world you load into is randomly generated. I tested this because I was not impressed with the start area that I loaded into my first game, but I do notice you definitely begin in an area that's considered a starter area.
- Unlike most farming sims, you have to pay for your starter tools, which also have a limited time use, so you'll find yourself constantly buying your tools at the beginning as you grind materials you can't use yet because you don't have every ingredient for the recipes they give you. This probably isn't a problem in multiplayer as it can be in single-player.
- If you want to be efficient, you'll have to craft yourself multiple stations because everything can only make things 1 at a time (I suggest making multiple bonfires and multiple furnaces so you're not wasting your time waiting for something to finish processing).
- I was never a fan of how much everything costed in Animal Crossing... On top of things costing a lot, if your ""town"" (that you begin forming at the get go, so be prepared to need to traverse the land a lot since most people typically begin building their base at the start area) is in ""debt"" (any new building that gets put down becomes a debt), then you can't progress with another building until you've cleared that debt. Basically, be prepared to have only a couple people on your island at the beginning as well. At least it doesn't seem too hard to earn money, but it does feel tedious because you're typically grabbing the same things over and over. Again, probably less tedious in multiplayer.
- There is no boundary in this game--it's like Minecraft, monsters can spawn in your base area, so be prepared to fight each day. So far, I haven't found a way to keep this from happening (like torches does for Minecraft). My trick is using the bonfire because just walking over it sets you (or anything else that walks over it) on fire!
- You can build relationships with the townspeople. I don't know what effect this has yet, but since this game is in early access still, I highly recommend maybe giving discounts on things? I mean, it's not like we're trying hard to collect money to pay off a huge debt and also spending money to buy our tools that we NEED after all... (No. There isn't a way to craft the tools at the beginning that I could tell--you can craft your weapon...if you have the ingredients.) You build the relationship by doing tasks. So far, the old woman who begins all this has asked me to collect insects that I had no idea where to get them from (surprise! they're in other biomes!).
- EVERYTHING TAKES ENERGY. HAVE COOKED FOOD ON YOU ALWAYS. Swimming costs energy on top of the tools taking up energy. Apparently the tools are supposed to take less energy as you level that skill up, but I still find myself needing more energy. ALSO. You can only eat so much at a time. I think certain foods might take longer to ""digest"" than others, but I haven't kept too close of a tab on the 3-part pie indicator next to the energy bar (it's circular and you can only eat up to 3 things before being ""full"" and then you have to wait for it to ""cooldown"" before eating any more. This can become a problem if you're fighting something and trying to heal.)
- Food gives different buffs and different amounts of health/stamina. Remember, the bonfire only cooks 1 thing at a time! ALSO. Cooking station? Can't make anything at the beginning because I don't have all the ingredients. I assume I'll need better tools to collect some of the ingredients (for instance, a meat stick requires a stick from a tree that the starter tool can't chop down), but unsure when that occurs.
- I hate most fishing parts of these kinds of games. Either they're too boring because they're too easy or they're tedious because it takes time to go through the mini-game. This fishing is a little realistic; you wait for the fish to pull down the bobber (makes a QUICK splash) and then you hook the fish. Once the fish is hooked, it IMMEDIATELY gives tension, so don't be holding down the left mouse button or you'll have to start over and use up a portion of your limited time tool. You fight the fish until you reel it in or lose the catch. Fish are swimming everywhere in the water...aim does matter because the fish has to see your bobber in order for it to begin swimming towards it--so either you get fish or you waste some of your tool time.
- You don't use the shovel in the same way you would in any other sandbox-like game. You pick up what you dig and you place it right back down. Great for landscaping and its unique way of ""planting"" things, but do not expect to collect sand or dirt or anything.
- You can make a boat to traverse the waters without using energy... Default controls are inversed and you can end up beached--the boat drives into the land really quickly and you go a lot slower to get out of it.
- I love/hate how easy it is to relocate my furniture/crafting stations... A quick press of ""e"" picks it up, so if you're used to ""e"" being used for interaction, be prepared to re-place your crafting stations (or I guess change the keybinding if it bugs you that much).[/spoiler]
- This game is still in early access. Some of these things could be fixed and some of these things will just become this game's unique feature to distinguish itself from other games out there that are doing something similar.

Overall, this game has a cool appeal, it just needs more content and better-defined details, which may be what gets this game out of early access. You're thrown into the game like you are in Minecraft and Animal Crossing--figure things out! Just be prepared to be slightly annoyed by some small factors that could effect the overall gameplay.",1704325008,1704325008,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Character movement isn't horrifically clunky, the townsfolk aren't annoying or insufferable, good variety of things to do, lots of customizability. But why I can't reccommend it is that in many places it's needlessly difficult, frustrating, or just irritating.

In the overworld hostile creatures are easy to avoid but in the mines they attack relentlessly and all hostiles in this game have way too much health and do way too much damage. Maybe you could keep on top of it with enough healing items but you are only able to use three consumables at a time before a long cooldown kicks in. 

You can both craft items and buy items but some vendors act as specialty crafting stations which require both items and a sizable amount of money to get an item. Money isn't too hard to come by but this still feels really bad.

Other things that just feel bad; I payed to build the mine, I gathered the materials, I put it where I wanted it but I have to pay a merchant who doesn't even work for the town for a daily permit to use my mine. It's not a lot of money but it still feels bad. {This one could be easily fixed by re-framing the mine pass as a belt that needs to be replaced everytime in order to use the elevator.)

Expensive and resource intensive items can be repaired either with repair kits or, if they're battery powered, with a recharge station. But if you use up the charge in a battery powered item it breaks. Why on earth would it do that.

There are things about this game I like, it doesn't explain everything to do you so you have to figure some things out. Fishing and planting trees are both things that took some getting use to at first, which is neat, but I also don't enjoy how fishing works and planting lots of trees is more tedious than anything in a chill Animal Crossing clone should be. As a counter to this the bug catching requires zero skill. You can't screw it up, you can't scare away bugs.

The one word I would use to describe my experience with this game is 'irritating'. There are so many little things that seem to exist purely to annoy.",1704250393,1704250393,False,7,1,0.522167801856994629,0,True,False,True

My biggest gripe so far is mostly just odd little things that can easily be ironed out, like being able to get some licenses way before you can even use them, and some bulletin board quests asking for things you have no access to yet.

1. I've spawned in my house and fallen through the world.  

2. There's a persistent bug where your ""take/action"" key/button is forced toggled on so that you automatically grab anything you walk by (not bad, honestly and can be quite serviceable) however it also locks you into chests, signs, and other interact-able objects which is utterly miserable.

3. I get that money. ""dinks"" are a joke in this game, due to trapping, but having to pay 25k a pop to go into a mine I've built and paid for is blowing my mind. I also love that there are a host of apex predators living down... how exactly? This should have been a ""smallish"" iron rich cavern for players to mine without fear of being attacked, and which renews every so often. Not what it is currently... an infuriating combat slog with seemingly very little iron.

4. I've spent all day looking for various bugs people want me to find, in the zones they specify, and they never spawn. ALL. DAY. Nothing.

5. Making friends feels intensely grindy, and not in the normal way. Having to track down many of their wants can take you all day and you only see them once every other week, perhaps? 

6. Ultimately, there are only a handful of ways in which this game is different than Animal Crossing, and while those are pleasant discrepancies, I'm not sure those distinctions are enough to set it apart. It feels like a clone, honestly. Even the god awful garbled speech, which, thank the gods, there is an option to turn off. 

The good?

The multiplayer is meaningful. Unlike AC, you don't just feel like a guest playing on someone's island. You can do very nearly everything they can do and you have a sense of agency. Trapping is broken for ""visitors"" and does not work properly, and I hope the developer intends to redress this as it's the principle way most earn their living. 

The island is much, much, larger than AC's and it contains unique biomes which are a nice way of breaking up what is otherwise a fairly homogeneous ecosystem. 

Fletch is not Tom Nook. 

Being able to manipulate your environment to the degree that you can is intensely rewarding, much like Minecraft. I spent a long time moving dirt in order to obsessively lay out/flatten my town, part of which involved the building a massive berm that surrounds the village to keep out unwanted animals like crocs and other pests. The moment when I realized all of this labor quite literally paid off in the form of making my bridge the sole choke-point which I could then trap, was glorious.

This is a pretty narrow line between yes and no for me and if in the future the developer resolves some of these bugs, I would be happy to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the genre, but in its current state, it begs the question, why not just play AC?",1703907981,1703907981,False,3,0,0.495441704988479614,0,True,False,True

Pros:
- More Strine slang than any game this side of the stump
- After the first day (tutorial), complete freedom to go about the whole game doing whatever you want.
- Lots of types of gameplay - can forage in the bush, farm crops, fish, mine ores, dig for treasure, raise animals, trap wild animals, steal emu eggs as big as your head from their nests and sell them etc.
- Lots of choice in how/when/if you build everything in the town
- Lots of vehicles ranging from wheelbarrows and gliders to helicopters and tractors
- Terrain can be dug up and put elsewhere, plants regrown elsewhere - the whole map can be rearranged, its hard yakka though
- Several methods of unlocking abilities - as well as skills, can also buy licences with ""permit points"" that give you access to buy/craft stuff
- Skills level up as you use things, as well as unlocking new tools etc they reduce your stamina loss when using tools so you can do a lot more
- No missable stuff if you don't do something ""the right way"" on a playthrough

Cons (nothing really bad):
- The option to pause the game in single player is not obvious
- No mid-day saves
- Quite limited space even in your upgraded house
- Too many items require specific bits of pre-disaster ""junk"" (old gear, old spring, keyboard, etc) which have to be found in random digging drops. Stuff like gears and springs should be craftable, even if by NPCs.
- The mine pass system is annoying (to have to buy a pass from the shop every time you use the mine elevator) - would be nice if a fully upgraded mining licence would let you have a permanent pass
- Clothing is completely cosmetic, would be nice to have some armour that reduces damage or clothing that affects stamina loss in heat/rain/etc
- Limited automation or delegation - you can unlock two types of sprinklers to water crops but would be neat to have more automatic buildings or be able to hire some NPCs to manage crops or animals.
- Lots of things are handwaved, like food lasting forever in chests, vehicles don't need fuel, buildings don't need power - not clear how electric lights and facilities work on an isolated island with no power plants. Even campfires and billies don't need more wood once built.

It's a mix of Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, but doesn't have the charm of any one of them. 

What made AC were its characters and the passage of time. There were a lot of colorful characters in the game, and you would randomly get a set amount of them in your village, making each person's town different. And the passage of time was tied to your real life clock which made it even more immersive. It made the town feel lived in. You were going back to your town every day during set hours, talking with your neighbours, doing some daily chores and relaxing. With time some new activities would pop up but this was the most of the game.

What made SV were also its characters and speed. The characters are the same for every player but it's fine since they're all different from each other personality wise, and feel fun to hang out with. You could grow close to every one of them, and could even romance them. The size of the map is not too large and every day is only 14 minutes in real time. This meant you were racing to get the most of every day. The farming mechanics were the main point of the game so there's a bunch of strategy and variety involved in that as well.

Dinkum has none of these, and worst of all, has nothing to distinguish itself from the other games in this type of genre. The characters are all boring and lifeless, every single mechanic in the game is way too simplistic, it's somehow even more grindy than the rest, the map looks cool at the beginning but a short walk shows how empty it is despite being so large, time never runs out, and the energy system doesn't feel balanced. I fail to see the point of this game, there's nothing to strive for. 

Hope it gets better once it gets out of early access.",1688598711,1703471874,False,3,2,0.486830830574035645,0,True,False,True

[olist]
[*]The camera: I‚Äôm literally nauseated by how the camera is implemented in the game. The developer has created several camera modes, all of which are poorly designed, as if they skipped Unity engine lessons and made obvious mistakes. The most significant error is in the free camera mode where the focus point wanders between the character‚Äôs heels and feet, causing a feeling of swaying and, consequently, nausea. They also miscalculated how to calculate the vertical angle, and when the camera is parallel to the ground, it is literally at ground level and looks at the character‚Äôs heels. Naturally, the picture will be blocked by bushes and other objects. In the second mode, the free view is turned off, and vertical mouse movement starts to respond to camera zoom, and horizontal - to fly around the character, which is not practical. The second significant error is that in both modes, the character is in the upper half of the screen, so when running forward (up), the view of the terrain is severely limited. It‚Äôs easier to play with a gamepad because you can fix an acceptable camera angle with the stick, but there are some other consequences of camera errors that interfere with normal interaction with the world.
[*]Monstrously slow and boring introduction: This is due to excessively stretched dialogues. The problem is that at the beginning of the game there are dialogues in which each NPC sentence is given in turn. The lack of ability to quickly fast-forward conversations is annoying, but ideally, dialogues should be more concise and informationally saturated. However, graphomania is a common problem with indie games.
[*]Some difficulties with learning game mechanics: Since I‚Äôve played many similar games, Dinkum‚Äôs gameplay elements look familiar, albeit in some moments underdeveloped or overcomplicated. However, I see that the game lacks clear and precise instructions. Lack of knowledge will make the player appreciate the acquired knowledge and skills, as it was, for example, in Minecraft, which has almost no built-in training. However, I think that the description of the game ‚Äúcozy‚Äù is incompatible with how the game treats the player.
[*]Some moments with NPC quests: These essentially force boring grinding.
[/olist]

I understand that Dinkum can hook with its atmosphere and some features. And if you like it, you can endure the shortcomings, especially if you do not compare with other games. But for me, Dinkum is too toxic. A swaying and uncomfortable camera, boring dialogues, too contrasting color combination, the need to perform some repetitive actions - all this has exceeded the threshold of patience, for me it is definitely not cozy and not relaxing.",1703446675,1703446675,False,9,0,0.493808358907699585,0,True,False,True

I do like the world, the map, the ease of harvesting resources, that the money making isn't a grind. It's accessing the farming part that is a grind.

If you play with a friend, the host decides a lot of things, too many things, in fact.

For example: If the client decides he wants to go in the mines, the host has to go too, or the client is simply unable to enter.

This restriction is incredibly annoying and made me stop playing.

If you compare it to a game like Stardew Valley where everyone can do as they please no matter what the host is doing, it's really not as good.

Dinkum takes the elements of Minecraft, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing that I love and adds onto them in ways I wouldn't have imagined or been able to enjoy without adding mods.

For a game so new, there is so much to do. And what bugs there are, they don't deter from the game. The developer is so fast to respond to game-breaking issues. 

I have been thoroughly enjoying this game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys simulative, town-building, creative meets survival gameplay.

My favorite features:
- Townies all have jobs, so we all contribute to the community. It makes the town feel alive.
- Manual tools to electric tools, all easily accessible/unlockable once you get the hang of the game and its economy.
- Breadth of things to do, craft, collect, and discover.

My nitpicks:
- I'd love it if I could pick a map before I dropped into the game. I restarted my save about 10 or 20 times before I got an island I felt I could work with.
- Could use more dialogue with townies, but I'm sure that's something in development.

Fair point, they do share similarities, but there are some notable differences. You can venture beyond the map to explore other areas, including mines and islands. Crafting or buying upgraded weapons and tools is on the menu, and there's a dash of challenge with hostile mobs thrown in. It's spread out just right, allowing you to steer clear of them, if you prefer, but for those craving a bit more excitement, they're there, along with their own brand of bosses. Playing with up to 6 friends? Now, that's a game-changer; it's way more fun than flying solo. I run a Minecraft server, and I can vouch that after watching me play, 7 of our members hopped on the bandwagon and are still hooked on the game.

Pros:  The game mechanics are really well designed and most of the basic farming/fishing/collecting you'll do is intuitive and enjoyable.
-Super easy to make money.
-The bad guys are easy to avoid until you actually want to engage them
-The NPCs don't want to marry you, they just want to trade.
-The digging up of treasure with the metal detector is a fun mechanic.
-Lots of options for getting around on the island that can be purchased to make resource gathering less grindy.
-Cooking has a real purpose in this game, and I appreciate that.

Cons:  -I have a feeling this game doesn't really end, and I kinda of wish there was more of a central story arc.  
-The story has this ""You need a permit"" and ""Debt is awesome"" mechanic that does help balance progression, but also kinda offends my libertarian tendencies.",1701625065,1701625065,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The ""progression"" of the game is not well designed. There's always a sense of ""what do I do now?"". Game doesn't do a good job explaining what you can do or how you can do it. You're free to do anything, but you don't know what to do.

Everyday the monotone NPCs give you a ton of chores to do that get boring VERY fast. Catch me this fish. Catch me this bug. Cook me meat. Trade me clothes.

I like farming, but how? I purchased Farming license, but no one teach me how to farm. I don't have the tools to farm and I don't know where to acquire them. Some days later a nomad NPC randomly came to sell me farming equipment and without any explanation I need to figure out how to farm. If you want tips you can talk with NPCs repeatedly and occasionally between the monotone NPCs trashtalk they will provide tips related to, well, whatever they want to at the moment. The farmer girl keeps teaching me where to catch bugs and fish, ok.

Next day she's gone and doesn't come back. NPCs rotate randomly every 2 days so if you mess up something you need to wait for a week or so for them to randomly come back.

Main NPCs tell me if I want them to stay permanently I need to increase friendship level and buy things. Which start another grind where I need to do the chores for randomly appearing NPCs until they decide to stay. It takes months. I'm into Winter and only got 2 of them to stay, and 1 of them is the woman who sell clothes I guess for showing off with friends in multiplayer.

Then I learned nowadays people don't learn about a game from inside the game, they need to alt tab to wiki, visit discord and forums to ask real human to learn how to play games that hava no explanation.

1st Post: I definitely recommend this game 100%! Multiplayer is more significant in this game than Animal Crossing. There are absolutely no restrictions when playing with others. You can build on each other's islands and explore the entire map together basically doing everything the Host player can do. I would like to see a pause button in multiplayer. It would make sense to add one only to whoever is hosting the island, so when they pause it automatically pauses everyone else. Fishing and farming both have very lovely mechanics! I love the fact that there are many different villagers to explore and bring to make the island more accessible and lively. I know a few people who want most of the biomes in a smaller area on their islands and will continuously restart the game for one, because of this I do believe that there should also be an easier way to obtain seeds of islands better.

DINKUM, from the moment I DINKUM start playing, I am immersed in a world of excitement and adventure. DINKUM graphics are stunning, and DINKUM gameplay is incredibly engaging. DINKUM, every level brings new challenges, keeping DINKUM the experience fresh and thrilling.

The DINKUM soundtrack is simply amazing, creating a DINKUM atmosphere that enhances the overall gaming DINKUM experience. DINKUM, the attention to detail in DINKUM game design is impeccable, and DINKUM, it truly sets it apart from other games.

DINKUM, the characters are well-developed, and DINKUM, I find myself emotionally invested in their DINKUM journeys. The storyline is captivating, and DINKUM, the plot twists keep me on the edge of my seat, DINKUM eagerly anticipating what will happen next.

DINKUM, the multiplayer mode adds an extra layer of excitement, allowing me to DINKUM compete with friends and DINKUM players worldwide. The sense of DINKUM accomplishment I feel when I achieve DINKUM new milestones in the game is unparalleled.

In conclusion, DINKUM, I firmly believe that DINKUM is the best game ever created. DINKUM, the developers have truly outdone themselves, and DINKUM, I can't wait to see what DINKUM they have in store for future updates.

--You start with about a dozen meal recipes, and those are the same dozen you have for the rest of the game... despite there being tons of ingredients that have no use at all.  Why not add recipe schematics for more meals?

--All of the other ""dimensions"" have very similar loot to each other.  Each dimension may have a couple items that you couldn't get in the previous dimension, but they are rare, and 90% of the loot is the same stuff you have had access to all game.

So many games for this genre have come out and been complete trash money grabbers. OR for being literally made by big teams- just lazy attempts with no heart!! But with Dinkum, you can actually tell that the Dev likes these kind of games. Its very Animal Crossing meets Stardew Valley and a splash of MySims, set in a very Aussie theme. I think where its headed is lovely.

Plus, many games in this genre have very boring styles for the characters. Which honestly for me, shows how much they don't KNOW the community, yanno? Many of us LOVE customizing and when the characters are either very basic or just ugly- its a very turn off (for me at least but im a creator/artist)! But albeit not the cutest or nicest style, i still think its style is charming. This game is still obviously still being made and not completed but i think the substance that is here is very promising!! And its made by what i believe to be a very small team or just one dude!! Which to accomplish what big ass companies or bigger teams at least could not- wow!! As a beginner Indie Creator and Dev myself, i admire the work put into this game a lot!!

If you're on the fence about buying this game now, lemme personally say that its well worth it especially more so with friends!! I got the whole tism squad on this shit!! ITs very neurodivergent addicting!! And there's something for everyone in the friend group to focus on or hyperfixiate on! I think this unfinished game blows bullshit like fae farm or any of the many forced out crap in this genre, out the water definitely! 

There isn't a whole ton of customizing options but that's still being added to. And honestly i think what it does have is good. There are also POC hairstyles! Even if just a few and many hair colors and fashion to express yourself! Just be aware that its still being added to and only JUST reached the big summer update even though its about to be winter IRL but that's okay, it was worth the wait!! You can tell the dev really cares about making the updates and roadmap actually worth it and didn't just try to force it out for money!! Theres still a autumn and i believee- a winter update on the current roadmap still to be added. ITs obvious that the creator has many ideas still and takes note of what we want!! Which in THIS game economy!?!? RARE LOL

So yeah, I can go on and on breaking down the actual game but im sure mannnyy others did that! Just take this as a thumbs up from a Neurodivergent POC Queer Indie Creator game lover!

My ONLY complaints so far would be: Theres no confirmed dating as of yet but honestly i thought id be bothered more but the game is so addicting you kinda forget!! (me n the homies just pretend we have our hoes), I hope there will be a bit more variety to the things you can find out in nature and the mines, even more inclusive customization obv would be great, more exterior decorations would be nice, more calendar events too although again you don't really notice it too heavily right now with all the other grinding content Rn, and just more variety of everything but im sure most of these are planned!

As of now, my unbiased rating is: 8/10
my biased rating is: 10/10

Minor complaint would be:
* Kinda of wish there was a headband and/or flower for your character to wear.
* There should be a cap on the money lost upon being knocked out. And there should be a distinction between being knocked out from exhaustion vs being knocked out from combat.
* Need more cooking recipes and better balancing. 
* Irwin shouldn't run in fear from crocodiles. 
* If Franklin doesn't show up on a semi-regular basis in the beginning, it really sucks having to keep buying and upgrading tool. Had like 30 almost broken shovel before he showed up D:
* I don't think John should sell potatoes or onions. Or if he does, it should be limited to 2-6 per day. Same with Sheila's green beans.
* Kind of wish John has a ""item of the day"" similar to Sheila's food of the day. But maybe only 1.5x $$$ and maybe only max QTY of 5-20. Same deal with clover, but for clothing.  Melvin for furniture. Thompson for bugs and fishes. It doesn't have to be every day -- ""item of the day"" was just used to describe the mechanic.
* Kinda wish for an umbrella... as in you select it in your tool belt and your character would hold an umbrella. It doesn't do anything, it's just for ascetics. It seems pointless, but... it seem like this games needs it because it seem very fitting.
* More hair style... but should be exclusive to Sally once you get her shop. Same with color; maybe multi-color? Maybe she should sell one random color paint (except gold and silver) every other day? I just feel bad that she doesn't have much utility compared to the other NPCs. Maybe she sell something that allows you to change your farm animal appearance? For example, a white chicken to a brown chicken.

Biggest complaint:
* There's a lot unnecessary clicking. Kind of wish there was a feature to hold-down to shake trees if you done it as the last action. Same with harvesting crops. Same with inputting items into grill/grinder/furnace/billy-can/keg. Maybe the dirt printer too? hold-down and it keeps printing until it reaches the current ground you're standing on.

Bloomin' Spring Update - Yeah, I knew something would change that I didn't like. The friendship decay with the npcs is super harsh and I really hope it gets an adjustment/way to turn it back off. :( Will not be playing again until this is adjusted. Originally a thumbs up, but I have to change this to a thumbs down until this is addressed.

Also adding the second level to the mines (that are already not a chill experience) is very frustrating. It seems like the dev is going to start pushing more down this ""adventure"" road rather than keeping the relaxing farming game that people spent hundreds of hours designing cool towns in. 

I got this game because I didn't want romance or combat, I wanted a chill farm and design game.

Apparently the Dev is no longer paying any attention to the Steam forums or even the majority of his Discord area. He's only reachable by a ""select few"" who are putting bad ideas like the heart decay into his ear and he's listening. 

So even if I had Discord my feedback would be ignored. Guess what? There's more people than just on Discord. I bought this game on Steam, not Discord. (What even is the Discord age group majority?)

Yes, there are mods. No, I don't use mods. Why should I need to risk 3rd party stuff to ""fix"" things that honestly should be quality of life and/or toggle-able? Not everyone has access to being able to download mods anyway.

The whole point of early access is to work out bugs and listen to the customer feedback. It seems like neither of these is happening, which is a real shame.

I understand that the single dev has got a vision, but either get your ""select few"" to bug test and then release it into the world fully formed. Or use early access without changing the things that people actually fell in love with about your game. 

If I had waited for full release instead of early access I wouldn't have bought this.

Summer Sun Update - The friendship decay might have had a minor tweak, but it's still happening. Just talking to them should work, I shouldn't have to do more fetch quests, but of course it doesn't. Time to use the Console Commands I guess. I've basically retired my old island for the time being, started a new one using the Console Commands as a sort of sandbox mode to relax and do the things I want to when I want to.",1669169095,1701042365,False,1,0,0.50200343132019043,0,True,False,True

I set it aside because I got crazy bored because it was moving too slow.  I played for two hours, harvested some food, caught some bugs, sawed some wood and that was mostly it.

I didn't get to anything that felt like fun yet.  Some games seem to add pointless drag as if they are trying to pretend they have more content than they do.  For example, in this game when you harvest, the fruit falls to the ground, then you have to reposition yourself to pick up the different items of fruit.  That's just a really tedious mechanic and I don't understand why some devs build that kind of tedium into games.  Tedium shouldn't be a substitute for content.

I really love the life sim/farming sim genre but I like more a ""My time at Portia"" pace, where things move along fairly quickly and a lot gets done in a day.   The videos look really cute, but I can't imagine how long I will need to play till I get to the point that I can start planting, farming or even building paths.

There are also too many text boxes and they are ultra repetitive.  Selling items is incredibly tedious - there's a long string of text boxes every time an item is sold and there doesn't seem to be any way to sell multiple different items at once.

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I never played Animal Crossing which is the main game it functions like, also Stardew Valley. The villagers are varied and interesting. You grow to feel the diff personalities really add to the civilization. There is ton to do, even the challenges aren't to a frustrating level and one HUGE thing is that when the day 'ends' it says Late and you can do all your mundane things that don't take a ton of energy such as cooking, log splitting, smelting, etc. Or be crazy like me and take lots of fruits and do all you want all night while spacing out your snacks. Fishing is fun, catching bugs is fun. Animals are cute and farming is fun enough. It rains often enough that watering isn't torture though it would be cool if fertilized soil plots held water 2x as long. The only negative so far that I have... is the colors. It's based on Australian Outback so the colors are designed to be very contrasty yellow and reds, but those colors are very harsh on my eyes and so I wish there was a way to adjust the color just a bit. The dirt in the pine forest have a bit more brown like the mangrove dirt so it differentiates from  everywhere else a bit more would also be nice. Besides the harsh color palette that can't be modified naturally I have rarely enjoyed a game this much.

The pros:
-Plenty of land to cover with lots to build and manage your town the way you would like it to be.
-Lots of fish and bugs to collect
-Fishing mini game is not that difficult compared to other farming sims
-You can dive along the ocean floor for certain sea creatures
-Lots of forage to gather and plenty of crafting opportunities
-Once you've earned enough license points and gathered the appropriate mining level you can then place the deep mine in your town for some fun and interesting mining opportunities.
-Fun NPCS that you can recruit to your island each with their varying personalities

Cons:
-You're promised farming in this game, but the merchant to get seeds may not show up until the end of the first month as the rotating merchants that come to your island are random and the seeds she sells may not be the ones you want. If you want to get a scarecrow you have to find a watermelon/pumpkin which I have not found out in the wild while foraging. Without a scarecrow the chance of keeping all your crops lessens.
-You have to buy basic tools from the shop, which becomes a problem in multiplayer when everyone wants a specific tool and may use it by the end of the day, the work around is having everyone buy up all their tools on their own islands before joining on a different island in multiplayer, which feels kinda silly.
-You can't craft basic tools just copper/iron tools, but you still need to buy a basic tool from John and convert it into copper or iron
-If you want to repair any tools you have to purchase a 30,000 Dink repair kit and a 60,000 repair bench which needs additional components before it can be built by a merchant named Franklyn that did not show up on my island until day thirty at the end of the first month.
-If you want to recruit Franklyn or any merchant you have to do jobs for for them increasing their hearts and spending an additional 190,000+ Dinks in their shops in order for them to consider to move to your island. You can never recruit them on the first visit and may have to wait an additional fifteen to twenty days or more before they show up again.
-There are roaming NPCS that show up randomly outside your town on your island, but are hard to find due to the size of your island.

Developed by James Bendon, Dinkum is a life simulator game that draws inspiration from the likes of Animal Crossing, but it stands out with its own unique tweaks and improvements. The game's setting, a fantasy version of Australia, adds a distinctive flavor to the experience. Each quest in Dinkum feels meaningful, and the gameplay choices have substantial weight, creating an immersive world that's both familiar and novel‚Äã‚Äã.
The game's core is defined by its strong quests and well-paced story. The mechanics, including activities like cooking, farming, jetboating, and spelunking, unveil gradually, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging. This pacing ensures that every in-game day brings something new to discover and enjoy‚Äã‚Äã.
One of Dinkum's strengths lies in its flexibility. The game's clock moves faster than real time, allowing for a more dynamic experience. The inclusion of elements like complex fishing mechanics and the presence of dangerous wildlife adds layers to the gameplay. The combat, though simplistic, brings an additional challenge that enriches the exploration aspect of the game‚Äã‚Äã.
The game can be overwhelming at first, with a multitude of tasks and activities. However, as you progress, you find a rhythm in establishing your town, managing resources, and engaging in various activities, from bug hunting to mining. This progression leads to the unlocking of new features, tools, and abilities, keeping the gameplay rewarding‚Äã‚Äã.
While Dinkum's gameplay can be somewhat repetitive, especially for those familiar with life simulators, it's the game's potential for growth and addition of new elements that keeps it exciting. The developer, Bendon, plans to continuously update the game with new content, including seasonal events, characters, and items, which suggests a promising future for this cozy sandbox adventure‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.
The game's graphics are uniquely cartoon-like, providing an appealing and engaging visual experience. This, combined with the variety of NPCs who visit your island, each bringing their own quests and interactions, adds depth to the game. These NPCs not only contribute to the game's narrative but also assist in various tasks, enhancing the gameplay experience‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.
 Dinkum is a delightful game that combines the coziness of life simulators with unique mechanics and an engaging storyline. Its cartoon-like graphics and NPC interactions add to its charm, making it a game I thoroughly enjoy and recommend to anyone looking for a comforting and captivating adventure.",1700757638,1700757638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'll update later, but seeing as I have 65+ hours after playing for less than a week, I figured I'd start this now. 

Imagine Australian Animal Crossing (NH), but you're being bossed around by a grandma, there are giant angry birds, and you have some kickass customization options. I love it, truly. It's a little buggy here and there, but it's honestly smooth for early access. 

-Graphics/performance: ACNH+Minecraft; the colors are SUPER vibrant, so if you have sensitive eyes, you may need to mess around with your pc's color/brightness settings, because I haven't noticed a way to do it in-game. Still running smooth with mods installed. 
-Music/Sound: the music reminds me so much of House Flipper, and I can't tell if I hate it, but I have the music turned down anyways, so potato potato. The thunder crash for thunder eggs makes me jump like a bish every time and I'm still salty. The animal noises are super cute & the villagers sound Animalese-ish. 
-Overall Story/Gameplay: the story is kinda cute. Grandma is a little bossy, but not condescending like a certain tanuki. The friendship system is pretty standard, although the neighbors sometimes have impossible tasks; it's not a game breaking occurrence, just motivation for more unlocks. Definitely grind, but the map is so big that I seriously never get bored of running around and hoarding. 

Overall: 8.5/10; I am absolutely obsessed with this game right now; some QoL features are definitely missing, but moddable. But for those who don't like modding, that could be an issue. 

I'll update later once I've progressed further",1695710448,1700678506,True,10,0,0.617612957954406738,1,True,False,True

The developer is very clearly passionate about this game and I'm excited to see what is added. For being a single-developer indie game bugs have been very minimal. 
The online functionality is 10/10. Works perfectly to have one town a group of friends builds up and progresses together. Also works amazing to open your single player world up and show stuff to friends.
My only complaints are with farming and mining and they're very simple issues.
Farming takes SO long to level from 1-20. Far longer than any other skill takes to go from 1-20. You don't unlock sprinklers until 20 farming so you need to hand-water hundreds if not thousands of crops before you access sprinklers. (not to mention sprinklers are extremely expensive)
My tip for farming: Grow things like wheat to get XP from harvesting and processing in a mill. Once I switched to growing/processing wheat I started leveling much more quickly. 
The deep mine was very very frustrating before I had endgame tools and weapons. Bats SWARM in the deep mine. Even if you kill them, 5 more will attack you 15 seconds later. Once I had the jackhammer I could mine ore fast enough to keep running from the swarm of bats and devils and crocos. However, while I was using pickaxes I DREADED going into the mine and for the most part ignored it. It really isn't the worst issue but it would be nice to see the bat spawns cut back a fair bit.
My tip: Have Franklyn build a couple quarrys in the early game. This should give you a fair amount of ore while you work on getting a jackhammer and quarries will stay useful into the endgame. I personally wouldn't recommend deep mining without the jackhammer unless you want to spend half the day killing bats.

If you want to make absurd amounts of money fish in the Northern Oceans after 6:00pm in Spring/Summer/Fall. Barracuda are quite common, can easily be spotted, and are worth 16,000 each. I make 250,000 dinks on an average night but have made over 450,000 in one night before. If you are in Spring or Autumn yellowfin tuna can also be found after 6:00 in all oceans and are worth a whopping 25,000 each. Using a rowboat or jetski helps increase profits a ton and the fishing book sold by Theodore after donating enough fish makes locating the barracuda trivial.

Dinkum's main highlight is its progression system. You can unlock many new recipes, abilities and whole game mechanics through purchasing Licenses from an npc. The brilliance comes from how you earn License Points, which is by doing virtually anything in the game. License Points are unlocked via Milestone achievements in an adventure log. These scale up in number depending on how many you've completed, for example: catch 10 bugs, then 50, then 100, then 500, etc.

The great thing is, there is a milestone for doing virtually anything in the game. There's the typical ones you'd expect like harvesting crops, catching fish, etc but there's other ones like for just walking around, or breaking tools, there's even for taking damage. This really makes it feel like no matter what you do in Dinkum, you are constantly progressing and utilizing your time towards unlocking things. In a game that has so much to do the game makes sure its  rewarding you for simply playing and partaking in any of these things. From mining, combat, fishing, farming, crafting, buying and selling items, etc. It means that no matter what you choose to do in a day you feel like it wasn't wasted, which I think is crucial in these types of games.

It seems like it's inspired a lot by Animal Crossing and Minecraft, which is a refreshing change from the Stardew Valley analogs I usually play. I'm loving the thrill of sculpting the landscape of my little seaside village and I love that I can spend all day fishing and make a ton of money.

I have a lot of thoughts on what could be improved but my only real complaint right now is how to get enough copper ore to do anything. There's tin everywhere but it seems like almost all important recipes and buildings and tools require a lot of copper and it's NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. I can walk around all day and be lucky to find two veins of it. It seems really broken. I unlocked the mine but I can't build it because I can't find enough copper!

After fourteen hours there is a lot I want to do but knowing how long its gonna take to do it, it's just not worth it.

What's worse is they take ages to show back up again. Everything takes so long. This game is clearly inspired by animal crossing, which I have never played but if animal crossing is this slow I don't know how people enjoy it.

14 hours in and I still feel like I haven't accomplished anything, I can see the potential, building my own town would be lovely but it would take actual days to get there and I just don't feel anywhere engaged enough to get there.

Very family friendly game, similar to Animal Crossing.
I've played several versions of Animal Crossing over the years (Switch and DS) and bought this game because it reminded me of it.
Dinkum is not an Animal Crossing clone as it also offers other skills like: animal handling, hunting, vehicles - to name a few.
In short, Dinkum has much more to offer than Animal Crossing.

Great game.
The country you are in is Australia, you encounter different animals, and you create your own world the way you want it.
So, if you like relaxing survival games, this is totally yours!

Pros: Fairly decent Cartoon-y graphic. Tons of things to do. 46 hours in currently and there is still a lot to do. Good value vs price.

Cons: Controls. O M F G this has almost made me want to refund this game. Need something on the ground?  You have to be faced JUST right and if its one block away you might as well move 3 and reposition. Very very clunky movement.  So much stuff to pick up it needs an auto pick up. Might be further in the game, but I haven't seen it. Turning just a bit to the left or right is a PAIN, might not sound important but when your Fishing its critical. Items get super expensive and the tool breakage rate doesn't help much. You feel like your barely treading water sometimes just trying to pay off a simple building that costs 125k coins. Selling: I dont know who came up with this stupid system but they need to be taken out back and beaten. You don't know what any single item is worth unless you sell it first.

Like all early access games, it does have missing elements and it does need some work but I have been pleasantly surprised at the mechanics of the game so far.

The day cycle takes about 30 minutes at a time, and the game is only saved each night when you go to bed - this has not presented an issue to me at all playing solo, or online in co-op, but I've noted other people mentioning its caused them to lose progress if they lost connection to the host before going to bed, so keep that in mind. 

I find the control scheme a little unintuitive - I often click the wrong mouse button or have to pause and think when I'm trying to use, move or place objects, perhaps something which could be altered a bit to be more natural, or maybe I will play with the controls. 

Some mechanics are not really telegraphed enough - the one that I didn't work out without looking it up is that there is a scale in the shop which can be used to weigh and pay for objects you might find when digging which don't fit in your pockets. This would be alleviated by allowing the player to interact with it and have John explain it to you. 

So far I definitely recommend the game in spite of those quibbles, I'm excited to keep growing my town and actually start designing and laying it out more now that I know what I'm doing.

Solo game can be paused to afk, multiplayer can be paused during day switch cutscene and nothing dies even if u don't play for days or weeks (that includes playing and ignoring garden anyway)

Can optimize every square of land and day hours or can spend entire day chasing butterflies whichever option sounds more relaxing to you. Game is not punishing. Except crocodiles..

Survival system:
The only things you should be concerned about are your health and energy levels. Even though health is easy to handle, energy can be a challenge when you need to do a lot of tasks, as you can only consume up to 3 meals. And if you do not eat on time, you lose some precious time. Mid and end game meals make it easier to manage.

Resident system:
Although it's a nice idea, it doesn't seem to be purely random. On one game, the same resident kept visiting each 4 days. And in another game, he has not come yet, after 3 seasons. Not sure if it's a bug or very bad luck though.

Skill levelling:
Farming is the only area where the difficulty is not balanced. I find it very annoying and very slow. End-game meals are the only ones that provide some XP boost. Despite completing 3 seasons and burying 250 seeds (not trees) of a few things, my level is only 7. It's not motivating.

Imagine Australian Animal Crossing (NH), but you're being bossed around by a grandma, there are giant angry birds, and you have some kickass customization options. I love it, truly. It's a little buggy here and there, but it's honestly smooth for early access.

-Graphics/performance: ACNH+Minecraft; the colors are SUPER vibrant, so if you have sensitive eyes, you may need to mess around with your pc's color/brightness settings, because I haven't noticed a way to do it in-game. Still running smooth with mods installed.
-Music/Sound: the music reminds me so much of House Flipper, and I can't tell if I hate it, but I have the music turned down anyways, so potato potato. The thunder crash for thunder eggs makes me jump like a bish every time and I'm still salty. The animal noises are super cute & the villagers sound Animalese-ish.
-Overall Story/Gameplay: the story is kinda cute. Grandma is a little bossy, but not condescending like a certain tanuki. The friendship system is pretty standard, although the neighbors sometimes have impossible tasks; it's not a game breaking occurrence, just motivation for more unlocks. Definitely grind, but the map is so big that I seriously never get bored of running around and hoarding.

Overall: 8.5/10; I am absolutely obsessed with this game right now; some QoL features are definitely missing, but moddable. But for those who don't like modding, that could be an issue.

+ Lots of stuff to do: farming, crafting, mining, hunting, trapping, decorate your house etc

+ Lots of fun vehicles to make
+ Can be modded to add even more quality of life options

+ Isn't real time like animal crossing: the game doesn't expect you to tailor your schedule to a video game

Cons:

- Invert aim option doesn't stick when aiming ranged weapons making it impossible unless you constantly switch the option on and off. I keep mentioning it on forum/discord. It still hasn't been fixed.
- Extremely tedious and grindy
- Expensive mechanical tools can break
- Has a godawful weapon/tool durability system
- Endgame is atrocious AND pointless: spend ages to Grind keys to waste them on treasure rooms that may or may not be empty. Then spend additional ages to eventually get enough ore to make ONE single tool not break, yet it still degrades.... yay!  /s
- Dev hides in a discord server surrounded by yesmen, making more and more questionable decisions, refusing to fix bugs, or listen to feedback.  Completely out of touch with their community.

The biggest plus is the amount of different things to do: mining, hunting, fishing, finding treasures, exploring underground mines, building the houses and town, animal husbandry and NPCs quests and errands. 

But... somehow it gets easily repetitive! You need energy to complete tasks and you need food to replenish this energy, but at midnight, energy stalls and your character gets chronically slow. That makes the days quite short. Crop seeds are ridiculously expensive as well and the return vs effort curve is reeeeeeally steep and I found it super difficult to level it up.

My old review was 2 hours in and somewhat hasty. 45 hours in, and a year later, I wouldn't recommend it and not for this price. There's content updates, sure, but there are too many quality of life updates that are basically needed to make the UI tolerable. And it's not like scaling/balancing issues like how resting on your bed should give you stamina, or how the mini map could have NPC markers - it's more issues like, ""The scroll wheel will not finish an action if you scroll 'too fast' before the entire animation is finished"", ""I fell through the floor when I woke up"", ""the game continues to make sound after I mute the master volume"",  ""there is no price indication anywhere for any prices"" and ""there is no inventory or storage autosort"".

It's also just god awful slow at starting, like beyond New Horizons initial grind, and I didn't like how woefully inadequate the metal detecting felt without sound - which sucks on an accessibility level but also a technical one that I could not progress with money and plans without being forced to do this metal detecting, with bad ui. 

It's buggy, to summarise. It is not a polished, complete product, and the longer you play it, the more problems appear. And with no objectives other than Fletch's ""nookmiles"" book that pads out the license grind, and no achievements, it's pretty hollow. 

INB4 ""It's early access, it's going to be incomplete and have bugs"" - I feel like the base game itself should be functional without the need for mods before they start adding freaking anniversary items and game events. Get out of Early Access and stop the bugs before you start adding extras.

Believe the hype. Spiritual successor to Stardew Valley by another 1-person dev. It's a perfect blend between Stardew valley and Animal Crossing for people without a switch, with a dash of Shovel Knight and Minecraft.

Until the mine situation is fixed I am giving this game a thumbs down. The cost of the mine pass is far too high and it is one time use. To make matters worse, when you get into the mine there is a chance you will be swarmed by enemies and you are downed and lose the rest of the day. I have had this happen both times I went into the mines. Others have complained about the enemies in the mines as well. The mines are critical to the game therefore this needs re-balanced.

I will also add that I have yet to find either of the two head items for the scarecrows. Without them all my crops are eaten before they can be harvested.

Edit

I am nearing the end of my first year and just started my day and all my money was gone. I payed off the last building available many days ago. The store was closed the day before. I had about an hour's worth of coin on me. It appears that this was due to giving Fletch the requested gift for her birthday, as has been posted on internet forums. 

9-28-2023

For now I will change my review to positive.

While the game has a significant imbalance related to iron, which is essential, it is a very enjoyable game.

Positives

Stable - no crashes
Activities -  Farming, bug catching, mining, museum collecting, relationship building, fishing, and more.
Customization - Vast amounts of clothing, terrain modifying options, furniture, etc.
NPCs - Many different NPCs to recruit and build relationships with, each with their own specialties.


Negatives

Saves - only after the end of a day, which could be 20 or more minutes.
Mines - Very expensive for when it appears and very unbalanced. I was attacked by 5 enemies the first time I entered. Killing bats is difficult due to the timing required to hit them. This was compounded by the inventor only being available 7-9 days over three visits during the first year who makes an item that is almost required for this location. It also requires an expensive pass each time you enter.
Pace - I feel the pacing of this game is far too slow. This is likely heavily influenced by not being able to get enough iron and the lack of inventor availability, in my case. It took 5 seasons to get him to stay on the island.
Requests - NPCs wanting items you cannot make or are ultra rare.",1695669703,1695915045,True,0,0,0.466159701347351074,0,True,False,True

It even has vehicles: the jet ski is loads fun! You can build your town how you like it and the game is also multiplayer (although I personally haven't played that mode yet). The game is totally playable even though there are a couple of hiccups but to be fair it is still in Early Access and the company is working on developing the game further, adding extra content and fixing any reported issues.

First of all the setting is obviously not a seasonal one like in Stardew, but tropical and therefore quite monotonous. You mostly get endless, glaring, harsh sun, ouch D: 
Secondly, the graphics have a much paler/colder pastel'y  Nintendo64 feel, compared to Stardews old school, warm, pixel looks. So anyone  expecting to get the same cozy feels as they did in Stardew, will be disappointed. This one doesnt have any of the warmth, coziness and mystical vibes of Stardew, unfortunately! 

As far as gameplay goes its allright, and its pretty cute in its own, strange way! Its mildly exciting during the initial phase of the game, moving to a remote island and getting set up is quite fun. At 36 hours however I feel stuck, and not sure if I can be bothered to continue doing the same things over and over again. I cant figure out how to get more islanders to move in, and the endless cycle of bringing the NPCs gifts is getting very repetitive. Theres not much of a storyline or depth of any kind, so it all feels kinda .. pointless? I feel like I should apply sunscreen while playing this, but I dont wanna be sticky.

Dinkum is the perfect game if you want a mix of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing and Minecraft. It's not as complex as the games listed in direct comparison when it comes to the specific abilities and possibilities each of these games provide, but it's a very good mix overall.

Easy to learn and still with a decent amount of depth. Yes, it's a lot of farming, crafting and building. Not to forget grinding is also part of it, but it's not necessary to grind excessively. You can play the game in short sessions and not regularly and still feel the progress over a pretty short period. If you like these attributes or even love these kind of games, Dinkum could be your game.

Also not to forget it's extremely relaxing. You can progress even while mostly growing plants. Yes, you will reach end game later, but you are not forced into a hardcore grind or something.

One of the best games of the genres i've played and not to forget to mention it's low price.
For me it was absolutely worth the price and time i've put into the game.


neutral: 

I wish there would be more variety when it comes to the amount of possible villagers or more enemies. Some people may not like the setting (Australia flair).


negative:

It has it's flaws, like some minor bugs, others are at least a bit annoying here and there. Disconnecting in Multiplayer leads to lose the progress like items for example (that happens not often but should still be mentioned until it's totally fixed).",1693790390,1693791419,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm still rubbing my eyes in disbelief that Dinkum is the brainchild of a single developer! This game is an expansive sandbox adventure that lets you explore, build, and thrive in a stylised Australian outback, and it's packed with enough content to rival titles created by much larger teams.

The attention to detail is jaw-dropping‚Äîfrom the variety of native flora and fauna to the intricacies of the crafting system. Whether you‚Äôre wrestling crocs, building your dream Outback homestead, or chilling with your mates around a campfire, Dinkum offers an experience as diverse as Australia itself.

It's not just the scale; it's the heart in this game that impresses. You can sense the love and care poured into every pixel and game play mechanic. And because it‚Äôs continuously updated, each visit feels like a new adventure waiting to unfold.

If you're a fan of open-world exploration and don't mind dodging a virtual snake or two, Dinkum is the bush-tastic experience you've been searching for.

games like animal crossing and stardew valley are very well respected games not just because of the gameplay but more importantly because of the charm they have. without this charm they wouldnt be nearly as successful as they are, and this game is no exception, this game is not only full of content, but the relaxing charm of leaving a big dull city for a life on the oceanside exploring caves and spearing crocs never gets old, its relaxing if you want it to be, but at the click of a mouse can be just as exciting too.

wanna relax? go fishing, make your settlement look nice, talk to the townsfolk. want excitement? go out and hunt crocs, go into the caves and get oars. no matter what your looking for, this game has it. and you can play with friends, which is always a bonus, 10/10",1693319803,1693319803,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Maybe in comparison to Stardew Valley the game feels inferior, and I think that's true largely to polish, but the idea of building up the whole town, the whole world being your sandbox, in comparison to just a small slice is an awe-inspiring and encouraging feat to tackle. I recommend Dinkum to all, and my more detailed thoughts on the highs and lows are as follows:

+1: The art style of the game is genuinely adorable, like Animal Crossing but warmer and lest harsh on the eyes. Even looking out over the haze of the world across the ocean is something I find myself doing.

+2: The settlers all feel very unique and have a great personality all their own. Though Clover may be a cultist/serial killer, I find myself really clicking with each of the NPCs in different ways, and unlike a game like Stardew, I generally engage with all of them fairly equally.

+3: The wildlife of the world helps it feel like it's always moving, and therefore keeps me wanting to enjoy the beauty of the natural generation.

+4: The shovel-scrap-finding mechanic is actually a really cool idea, and helps make the crafting recipes more reasonable and fun to gather supplies for.

+5: A weird one, but I love the vehicles in the game. I just wish the sailing boat was easier to get the recipe for.

-1: The deep mines are mechanically unbalanced. I don't like having to pay a big chunk every time to use it, especially when it already takes so much to build the elevator. The cost of losing day of progress elsewhere all for some stone and extra ore doesn't feel like it's worth an extra 25k every time you want to use it. Even the secret rooms require keys and collectables that can be hard enough to find. Add to that the difficulty at level 2 and I think the only way to not feel like you've been wasting money and time is if you reset the day when you die; a mechanic I hate doing but often do because of how overpowered those lizards are. I think the elevator passes should be one pass to unlock that level (25k for lvl1, 75k for lvl 2, etc) for unlimited uses and/or the base cost and materials to build the elevator should go up.

-2: Minor, but crafting should really use nearby chests. It's tedious to go back and forth to chests to find things, even with the help of the checklist. It would also help to craft multiple at once: let the game spend 2 minutes crafting a ton of paths while I go to the bathroom rather than have to sit and click a button every 3 seconds.

-3: Crafting blueprints themselves... super tedious and annoying to get. I wish there was more consistency in when you'd get them from NPC quests, offer them in lieu of bulletin board dinks, and give more variety at Franklin's lab. At the very least I'd like to see all the recipes I'm still missing, just greyed out, but more over I think it would be nice to have a wider range of available recipes at shops or some indication as to a blueprint reward for completing a certain request.

-4: Shop inventories in general are frustrating, especially Rayne's seeds. I understand furniture and clothes being a small rotating selection and a list of everything you've already gotten and want more of, but it's really annoying when she doesn't have the seeds you want. There should be a full selection at all times. The same goes for John's goods, at least regarding food and parts as getting Sheila to the island requires so many flour, sugar, and crops that are seasonal and hard to get early means you'll take forever to actually be able to get her recipes.

-5: Either remove the penalty from failing to make a daily request or give the option to speak to the NPC and back out. It's very annoying when RNG means you can't find an item that you've spent a day searching for or it turns out you're missing one ingredient for the recipe. This would also allow you to actually put harder requests like rarer fish and bugs without deterring players all the time.

-6: Rechargeable tools shouldn't break when they drain. I hate that I can't get better tools because every opal has to go to new dirt printers because the bar doesn't always drain at the same rate. It doesn't make sense that the mining helmets turn off when they run out but a power tool just evaporates.

Again, most of these are fairly minor, and for an early access game. Let me know your thoughts, but I hope the developer takes things like these from a heavy player into account. I love everything you've done, and just want the game to be as approachable and fun as it's clearly built to be!

So, here are my thoughts on Australian Harvest Moon with a dash of Animal Crossing.

For an early access title, it's pretty fun! There's a lot of things that are there at the jump for you to interact with once you unlock them, from farming and animal rearing to fishing and animal hunting. You go out into your own little outback and start to build a little town from the ground up, enticing townsfolk into your little community by doing tasks for them. At the time of this review I have only 4 people in my town and the last one to finish a major task hasn't wanted to join my town. There is also a debt system similar to Animal Crossing with building any building and the prices are a BIT high, especially for the beginning of the game.

Another problem I have is that it feels like resources for certain things are sort of hard to find? Copper especially seems very scarce to find once tin/iron seem to be the main material for most crafting materials. Granted I did just unlock the deep mines so perhaps more ore is plentiful down there. The game music also doesn't really loop much, going into long stretches of time with no sound.

A MAJOR problem that is a bit of a nit-pick is that time in game does not freeze unless you hit a button in the book menu to actually pause the game. Talking with npcs and buying/selling things does not freeze the time so it feels like you're in a rush to do these actions unlike most farming sim games of this variety.

Overall, the experience is fun and it is enjoyable to play with only a few minor things that dampen the fun only slightly.",1692761406,1692761406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

For everyone else, this is a mishmash of ACNH + Stardew + 3D Harvest Moon + Minecraft. It lacks the soul and charm of all. Like a pale imitation or copy. Even the emotes seem like they were added without much understanding (they're weird). An air of awkwardness permeates Dinkum. If you never managed to get into Minecraft because it quickly starts to feel like work and a manual labor simulator... Dinkum feels more like work than a game. Tons of tasks, chores, tedium, and monotony. I didn't care for the aesthetics either. Pixelated and generic. 

The game just didn't work for me. That preview video at the top of the page is after hundreds of days. This game seems like a, ""It gets better once you get out of Midgar."" game if you know what I mean. Don't expect jetskis and hang gliders when you start.

I had ""No"" selected while writing this review. I don't imagine the vast majority will stick with it through to the end. I think like many indie games, most are for a niche group of players. However, for the amount of play hours Dinkum will provide for it's cost and the fact that its like the first game to finally try to merge so many other games into 1, I switched it to ""Yes"". I have no plans or patience to play this anymore. 

My favorite thing about 'Dinkum' is just how lazy it makes Nintendo appear to be. ACNH was a big disappointment. Ridiculously shallow. Extremely time gated. Probably a huge team of experienced developers and what we got is what they sold us for 60 big ones ($). A tiny indie game crams more content in for just 20 ones. The state of AAA gaming anymore  is depressing.

Voting with your wallet is getting harder every year in video games and indie games will be the last shining oasis for many gamers to cast their votes and still have a voice. I don't feel bad about buying this game. Maybe years from now, I'll be in a better place mentally where I won't mind dropping 100+ hours on a chores sim game again. Its like my stamina bar needs to refill. Until then, this is a vote I'm happy I made.

Honestly, I have to say it... ""FINALLY!"". Every time a game is popular and does well, copycats come out of the woodwork and release their version in an attempt to get a slice of that sweet pie... or improve upon ideas. Look at 'Vampire Survivor' or any match 3 game, WoW clones, Minecraft clones, the GTA like games. Animal Crossing came out in the 90s. The nineties! It was successful. For decades. No copycats. Top selling game over Covid. Nothing. Then this game releases. Maybe there are other attempts out there, but I don't remember them and never heard of them. ACrossing is a low low bar too and it still took all these years. Really quite strange if you think about it...",1692726616,1692726717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's exciting, similar but different, and massively addictive. Those 81.2 hours of mine were in an embarrassingly short period of time.

Another nice and rare to find feature is the music, varied and relaxing. Plus, I also appreciated the fact that sometimes there is just silence and no music. Deep congrats to the creators! <3

And the mines are really rough too, it really sucks when you get swarmed right out of the elevator and die, especially when going to the mines is so expensive.

After i got home, i was looking for something to play and feeling very blah so i jumped into this hoping it would be the thing that made me feel better and it is! I was thinking it would be a sort of bland ""farm together"" task sort of simulation game (i love simulation games don't get me wrong) but it's actually much more than i thought it would be and i'm kind of hooked now!

It's been really cool recovering while playing this game. I haven't even explored the entire map, but i absolutely LOVE this game! I really enjoy the fact that everything, or nearly everything has a use or a purpose and a lot of the items aren't exactly easy to get & take a bit of grinding to obtain.

Some of the animals i thought would be hostile aren't while some i thought would be very tame are not so it's definitely keeping me on my toes. i am pretty impressed with the overall weather and wildlife in the game  especially seeing as one sometimes seems to effect the other as well as time of day and many other things. There is a LOT to do and residents to help out and convince to stay, things to build, and Dinks(money) to earn.

Over all, super happy with this purchase. This turned out to be a really cool game. i hope there are updates in the future and other possible games similar to this from this dev.

Some stuff to note:
* ""passing out"" or dying damages all your tools, so avoid that!
*Sleep to save your game if you log out without sleeping until the next day everything you did will be unsaved.
*If you buy chooks from Irwin, pen them in first so the dingos don't eat them, because it's nearly impossible to pick up an animal once you have placed it!
*Help EVERYONE! it makes them want to stay in your town and that ultimately helps you out a lot! They will also help you out with items and dinks.
* BUILD! especially a bulletin and some of the cooking and crafting tables. 
* Check your mail! There's cool stuff in there and tips about stuff you definitely want to know about.",1691402177,1691410435,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

„ÄÄIf you're familiar with Animal Crossing, then you'll get the idea, but this time without the furry or cat characters to dance and making baby with. There are also better features like a rotating camera, items that aren't just repeated 'leaf sprites,' and a larger area to build and explore. Since it's set in Australia, you'll encounter both dangerous and harmless animals that you can hunt for meat. For example, you can hunt dogs and eat their meat.

„ÄÄ There's so much content that makes this game worthwhile even in its early access state. Overall, I hope they can incorporate new features based on player feedback. And yes, as mentioned above, we've had issues within the community.

„ÄÄI didn't mind the game's style‚Äîit's cute and beautiful at times. But if you're giving it a go after reading my review, you might notice the colors aren't great. Yep, you're totally right about that. On the forum, some random Aussie might say, 'Fuck you! That's how we see things here! no need to change!' It's kinda funny how they're cool with their whole continent looking that way, basically telling people not to bother visiting Australia. I mean, who'd want goes to a place that has dirt looks like that?

„ÄÄAs for other graphics, sometimes they're a bit off, especially the shadows using that cell shading thing. When it's sunset or sunrise, you'll see this awful shadow effect. But the rest, like the 3D stuff, is fine. Good thing, I found color mods on Nexus, using them now. So, don't afraid thinks the game would make you blind. because mods got it covered.

„ÄÄOnline works well, but there's a catch. That's why Terraria is more successful. Different gameplay? I don't care about other Aussie opinions, so screw you. Dinkum has a world seed limit, and some plants don't come back. This traps you into trading in the community, needing to visit others or use two PCs to get a new world for that resource. Unlike Terraria, where you can take your character to other islands or worlds locally, Dinkum makes you trade with random people to buy seeds that won't come back after you chop them in your world. That's my problem. Just watch out for Aussies when trading (If you'ev tried to join the community, you know what i mean).

„ÄÄAh yes, you're an Englishman from Britain, loving tea, coming to a continent and claiming it as your own, full of emus. You declare war on those poor, harmless animals. And there's also this creepy, evil old lady who enslaves you to build an entire city by yourself, then declares herself the next president‚Äî'making Australia great again.'

„ÄÄYou know, I think she's the villian of this game. You pay her to give her what she wants! Yeah, always respecting the elder, I guess. That's why we can't afford houses anymore these days.

„ÄÄThere's no visual indicator when animals attack you, only through sound. Remember the guy named 'Ted Selly'? Well, if you're deaf, you'll be poor forever. Even though he had an indicator when he whistled, it's gone and there's no permanent indicator, so why bother? I understand that for an indie game, accessibility might be lacking, but for regular people who can see, that color palette is so painful.

It seems like all Australians are toxic, as if they believe this game is only for them and everyone living there would buy it. I mean, apparently in Australia, killing crocs and eating dog meat is a real and common thing. I guess I even prefer Chinese people over Aussies.

„ÄÄI hope the devs weren't paying those Aussie trolls to prevent people from giving feedback, because it certainly seems that way now. Have you ever tried Stardew Valley? Every feedback is treated as a game feature there and it sells more. Then playe it instead? I already played it and more other games. and yeah I hope all games in steam for australia is overpice like 100$ australian dollar because having that weird dirt color is a sins.

While it does share some similarities with Animal Crossing in its small features, there's a significant missing element: the villagers. Instead of regular residents, all characters on your island serve specific functions like shopkeepers, quest givers, instructors, museum head, etc. Though you can form bonds with them, the depth of those bonds is limited. Furthermore, the lack of variety in characters makes the experience predictable for everyone as the order in which your island grows does not change.

One minor gripe I have is the monotonous landscape, entirely comprised of different shades of brown. It becomes visually dull with no diversity. Incorporating different biomes or the full implementation of seasonal changes could significantly improve this aspect.

Overall, the game is okay, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're seeking an Animal Crossing-like experience.",1690965299,1690965299,False,5,3,0.451979696750640869,0,True,False,True

This game actually feels rewarding to do even the most basic tasks. When you unlock licences by Fletch's tent/town hall, this game doesn't hold me down for anything. 

You can get sprinklers to water the crops for you, there's animals and bosses to defeat, there's hidden (and regular) NPCs that can give you the best stuff in the game if you have the resources, if you reach a good friendship with an NPC they can fight, farm, and harvest with you and a cave system that has some cool items like the glider, a wand that can spawn rocks/ore, a bottle that can make the game rain and more that i haven't even discovered yet. (At my pace lol) Watch out tho if you're new, it can be quite challenging

This games community is sweet too. The discord has a ton of nice people that can help and even have a tab for mods! Just watch out for those random public lobby trolls.

The one thing I was afraid of is overabundance the orange desert look when I made my purchase. However when you have the flooring you want, you can make even mountains have an industrial look if you really wanted to. So don't worry about that :)

Overall a must buy especially if you wished more from New Horizons or a fan of chill games like this.

I enjoy that my map can at any point change from single player to multi-player without being restricted to always being single player on a save. Fishing is very fun and I even miss a few so its not too easy. I love seeing everyone's shared pictures of their unique towns! 
 Only draw back for me is I have to step away a lot while playing games and as much as I love the pause button..... I would like the sleeping bag to save without having to end my whole day.

As many have said, Dinkum most definitely takes inspiration from games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley. At first, it might almost feel like you're playing an AC fan game, which is far from being a bad thing as AC is incredibly addictive and time-consuming in the best way. For example, you'll never run out of things to do thanks to a daily task system which gives you 3 optional tasks daily. These small jobs can be anything from mining to helping out your neighbors with their requests, and completing the tasks will give you special currency which you can spend on upgrading your toolset and things that you're allowed to do on your island.

Speaking of the islands, there are a few small areas where this game doesn't act like it should. For example, when you start the game you get a randomly generated island where you begin your first few tasks. These tasks are mandatory for progressing into the more open parts of the game. Unfortunately, on my first time generating one of these islands, I was spawned on a small sand circle where the closest island with the resources I needed to progress was farther than I could swim with the current energy bar. That meant I was stuck and had to start a completely new save. Fortunately, I got a far better island the second time around. Aside from that, the only other issues I've experienced with the game so far are small visual errors such as water tiles not being seamless and my character managing to stick his head through one of the NPC tents.

Overall, despite its few bugs and poor design choices, Dinkum is a great game for anybody looking to express their creativity in a long-term town builder. If you're a fan of Animal Crossing, you'll most definitely enjoy this game. Even if you aren't or haven't played Animal Crossing before, I'd still recommend trying Dinkum as long as you're a fan of building/slow-progression games. It's perfect for all ages despite having a more cartoonish style.

In total, I give Dinkum an 8/10. :)",1689847620,1689847620,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Since there's no day to day system like animal crossing (you can go to sleep and start a new day immediately) it feels the grind and upkeep to break into more convenience is a big high.

This game feels like a good mix of Animal Crossing and Stardew valley. However, it's lacking in that the game feels a bit empty and soulless. The NPCs are great, but since there aren't a lot of them, the island feels like a barren land.

The wiki says there are 8 biomes total, but it really just feels like there's 2-3 that are the same but have different colored grass and trees. I'm not sure if I'm playing the game the wrong way, but after 13hrs, I am still in Summer, which I only bring up because that means I've only seen about 3-4 different bugs on the entire island and maybe 4-6 different fish, regardless of the time of day. This island also takes a good amount of time to walk from one side to the other, and the only thing I see along the entire walk are trees, water, and foliage. The animal life is pretty sparse and not too diverse.

Worst of all, I think a lot of this could be remedied if the early game weren't so slow. The energy system feels like something that creates a large unnecessary grind to maintain your energy and keep food supplies for it. Maybe it gets better late game, but it seems to have a lot of grind associated with it to get to the fun part of the game like the trailers have where you have an established town and a nice island. After enabling cheats to see, it also seems like there isn't a whole lot of options for decoration in general.

I think if the game had more to it, it could be very enjoyable. More bugs, fish, and critters would make the island feel more alive. For example, Animal Crossing has anywhere from 20-30 different bugs and 20-30 different fish that can spawn per month, so if the game had something like that with their season system, that would help the island feel more diverse. Also, maybe increasing the spawn rate of insects once there are more would help. 

Another thing that would help is more decoration. Again, I know it's early game and making all of these things takes time, but with Animal Crossing, there's a LOT you can do both in your house and on your island. With Dinkum, even after 13hrs, I have almost 0 decorative options for outside aside from pathways and fences. Maybe I missed a vital part of the game, but I don't have any recipes to make furniture with.

It might be important to note that I played this solo. Maybe it's more fun with friends? I think in another year or two, I think this game will be a solid 10/10, but as of right now, it's still a bit too rough around the edges for me.",1689573807,1689573855,False,21,0,0.669337749481201172,0,True,False,True

A loooot of games.  Dinkum was... a pleasant surprise!  It's definitely not as developed as either of the above games, but it does reflect the spirit of both games.  And I do want to distinguish that from 'ripping off' SV or MC which, again, a LOT of (terrible) other games have ended up being.  Dinkum definitely has many of the same features, but it's all its own flavor.  The world design - characters, objects, animals - are unique and appealing, the map design is clean and distinctive, the quests and gameplay revolve around a novel story.

On an initial playthrough I found the gameplay very cute, but a slow grind to build the town.  I put it down for awhile, and recently picked it back up - after I stumbled on a discussion that it had mod support!  I downloaded what I wanted and fired the game back up.

Now, I'm not here to say that the game isn't good without mods - there are plenty of people who love it as is.  But the beauty of a game that allows mods is in how it can affect the game.  Worst case scenario, your game remains mostly unplayable but people play longer than they would otherwise because the mods do everything they can to fix what the makers didn't (cough cough, Skyrim, cough cough, My Time At Portia).  Best case scenario is that it can draw in hitherto uninterested players and greatly expand the fanbase, as well as greatly increasing the amount of replayability for those fans.  So I think it's well worth pointing out that while it's not yet workshop enabled (I believe James has stated that he's hoping to implement that later), there are mods available outside of Steam and while the setup is a bit confusing at first (I had to find a tutorial), once you've got the basics done it's very, VERY easy to add and remove, and I have yet to discover a conflict between what I've chosen.

So what type of mods have made this game more playable for me?  Well, first of all, I have ADHD, and I have worked some VERY stressful jobs in the past.  When I open up a game such as Dinkum or any of the similar I listed, I'm looking for a game that is very peaceful, very isolating, something that makes me feel as if I'm alone in a non-threatening world where I can go as I please and make as I please.  The scenery, the design, and the music all make that happen, and the rest is simply tweaking.  So I turn off animal hostility because I want them to be part of the peaceful and beautiful environment I interact with, not something that's constantly distracting me from it.  I make fish and insects stackable and able to be put in containers because trying to track gifts and quest items tweaks the ol' ADHD anxiety.  I add a sprint feature because I love running and leaping like a gazelle.  I add a communism mod because listen, I'm the one out here doing all the hard work of building and gathering for everyone else's profit, so y'all are gonna get your taxes on new buildings upped, deal with it.  Inventory management, because again, ADHD YIKES.

I do have more but the point is, purists would point at the above and yell ""that's not the same game anymore!"" and my response is ""yeah... isn't it *great*?""

Making a game takes a lot of work - a LOT of work.  This game's maker has clearly put their heart into it and they've been very good with providing updates on the progress as well as releasing new content to try and keep people interested while working toward an official release.  Putting aside their ego enough to keep their game friendly to mod makers and to people like me is simply the sign of a very good creator - a creator with a healthy ego that allows for room in their world for people who aren't exactly like them to still come in and have fun.  I'm very grateful for that sort of mindset, and I absolutely believe the early access price is reasonable for what I've received in turn.

I lastly want to hark back to the animals I talked about.  I LOVE the animals in this game.  A great example is 'diggos', clearly a variation on 'doggos' and immediately makes you want to love and cuddle them and make them your pet - and you CAN!  Another sign of a good gamemaker, understands the OBVIOUS result of putting adorable puppers in games and doesn't be a jerk and make them non-interactive forever.  But the hostile animals are just as adorable!  The crocos with their adorable big smiles, the bush devils that are 1000% distant relatives of Stitch, so you're damn right I don't want to fight those cuties!, and the cuuuute frilly frills and their running animation!  There are many more adorable animals to be found, but those are certainly my favorites.

Anyway, it's time to jump back in and play some more Dinkum, but James' latest post reminded me that I've very rudely never sat down and taken the time to express what about the game makes it worth the purchase for me.  Thank you, James, and happy anniversary to you and your wonderful and personable game!",1689445373,1689445373,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Wanted to make and share a island together with my friends but as it is right now there are some unnecessary host privileges that I really see no reason to exist. This is especially bad since the game is marketed as a multiplayer focused game but clearly didn't think these things through.

* Only the host can place buildings.
* Only the host relationships matter when inviting villagers to live on the island.
* All players have to enter the mines if you want to go there.

These limitations could easily be fixed with permissions and the mine shouldn't be a problem to fix either.

Another thing is that the characters designs are really boring and bland.
The ""voices"" sounds very robotic in general and more so when emoting.
The game has multiple band cell shading for some reason that makes the graphics and especially the characters and light look really crusty.

I also selected fishing as my first license so I could catch fish and have early reliable source of energy since it runs out so fast. But I never found a way to cook it. There aren't even any recipes in the cooking table that has fish in it.

For the town itself, you have to build everything from scratch and get NPCs to move in, similar to Animal Crossing. You have a set amount of NPCs that you can do requests for and level up their ""hearts"" with you. I'm understanding you gradually unlock more perks as you raise your heart level, but I don't really see much of a difference at this time. 

Most things you can't really do immediately, though, since the game works on a licensing system. To get a shovel, you need to get a license. To fish, you need a license. Basically, to do anything meaningful early game, you need to get a lot of licenses. Those licenses are obtained with Permit Points, which is just like the Nook Points in AC. Luckily those points are easy to rack up. It keeps the game at a fair pace so you don't complete everything too fast.

My biggest complaint is that there's obviously not a lot of content implemented just yet. Some items like toad skin have no use whatsoever besides selling for a meager amount of coins. Bottle-wood trees don't respawn or drop seeds. Once you've explored enough and obtained a few licenses, there's not much more that the game offers. 

There's also a handful of bugs or concerns:
- Sometimes the map may load incorrectly and you will clip under it and fall.
- I've had a few dialogue boxes that just say ""Need Text Here"", or there's just blatant grammatical or spelling errors. 
- Shop owners sometimes never navigate to their shop when they're supposed to. This is already pretty frustrating considering NPCs have specific days off. For example, John is off on Sunday entirely, so whatever you need to sell or buy has to wait until Monday.

A few more suggestions:
- Going back to the NPCs having days off, I like the idea. The reason they have days off is to let the player ""hang out"" with them. They can help you do small tasks like water crops, chop down trees, or maybe hunt. There's not much else, though. There's no way to tell right now what NPCs have what days off though, which is frustrating if I want to go to the bank or buy more seeds. It's not a great trade-off for a ""hang out"" feature that isn't great to begin with.
- PLEASE make an easier way to make scarecrows besides pumpkins and melons. I have to gamble on whether my crops will survive (including the pumpkins and melons) themselves for a good chunk of the game because I have to wait for those two to grow. And they take almost 2 weeks in-game. 
- Maybe unlock sprinklers earlier or reduce energy for watering? Realistically, you can only have a handful of crops early game since watering them can easily take up all your energy.
- Stop making NPCs wander so far from town. I hate having to track them down if they decide to wander halfway across the map.
- There's no separate storage system for clothing and furniture like in Animal Crossing. I am stuck with several crates or drawers just to hold a few shirts, couches, beds, etc. 

MULTIPLAYER: 
It's alright. It's not ""true"" co-op, in the sense that you're really just visiting someone's island and helping them out, like in Animal Crossing. It's not like Stardew, where you feel like you actually have your own livelihood outside of the host. But it's also not as restrictive as Animal Crossing, where you can't even pull out an axe. It's basically having a buddy to help you do things, but they don't really get much out of it. 

Overall, I enjoy Dinkum quite a lot, but there still needs to be more content. More fish, bugs, tasks, etc.",1689209764,1689209764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you like Animal Crossing: New Horizons and also like Stardew Valley then you'll love this game. I see a lot of people describe this game as Aussie Stardew but I honesty feel that its more similar to ACNH. Having to add new NCPs to your town, building and creating your town/island to your hearts desire are all there, but with the added benefit of a combat type system and more farming. 

So if you like move at your own paced games where you control how fast or relaxed the game feels this is the game for you. Plus the added little Aussie jokes/Easter eggs truly are the best!

I also wish we could build/craft from our storage without having to move each item to your pockets/inventory to use. Also, a little bit of guidance would be nice if several days have gone by and not a lot has progressed. I bought the machine manual and couldn't figure out how to use the darn thing...same with the house customization kit. FINALLY googled and did it. 
James - kudos for a awesome game! I love all the cute little decorations and what not. I can't wait for me to get some friends on here and to visit other islands!",1688930708,1688930708,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

There is a * on that statement though. Here's why.

A lot of people compare this game to Animal Crossing and while I see the comparison there are some BIG differences. The biggest difference being that this game has combat. Not all animals in this game are aggressive but there are aggressive ones.

You have the Croco's (crocodiles) that will chase and bite at you, Glowing Croco's (in the deep mines), Sharks, Wary Mu's (cassowarys), and then Bush Devils that will shoot fire balls at you. Now as long as you don't set up your base close to nests of Bush Devils most stuff is pretty managable. Run far away enough and most stuff will leave you alone.

It's a little less different in the Deep Mines though. You are going to need to go down there at some point in order to get the ores you need if nothing else. Yeah there are goodies down there and rubies, but frankly the main reason I go down there is for ores because on the surface there is VERY little Iron to be found at a point.

So you are going to HAVE to go down into the deep mines at some point and you will be one of 3 people...

-The person that fights everything
-The person that runs past everything
-The person that panics while fighting and running

As you get chased by Bush Devil's, Glowing Crocos, and Bats.

To be honest the part of the game I hate the absolute most is going to those stupid mines. I don't like it. I don't mind the combat on the surface because most stuff in avoidable and I can just choose if I want to fight something for the resources they give. In the mines though it feels eerie cause it's so dark and the Glowing Crocos are easy enough to avoid but a Bush Devil pops up out of no where, scares the hell out of me, and slams my panic button with a fire ball like it owed it money.

So I generaly avoid the mines as much as possible and just get the trickle of ores I get here and there from mining ores, breaking giant boulders in the oceans, and grinding glittering rocks. I only go to the deep mines if i REALLY have to.

Outside of combat though there are comparsions to Animal Crossing. The usual stuff. Catch bugs, fish, farm, decorate, etc. Just in Australia with weirdly named Australian wildlife. You also get ""villagers"" but not really. The people who gather to your settlement are people and each of them mans a store of some kind. With Fletch being this games Tom Nook. Sitting there behind her desk... judging you for not dropping thousands of dollars on someone elses business and home immediately.

Also the multiplayer in this game is LEAPS above Animal Crossing. I haven't done muliplayer because no one else i know has this game, but I've watched videos on it and it's amazing. Your friends can actually do stuff like decorate, terraform, mine, fish, basically anything in the game with you. It's great.

I do have my little complaints about the game and have an on going list of suggestions in the discussion forum on their steam. For the most part though there is nothing major I have an issue with. The game runs great and at it's current state there is plenty of game for the price you pay. I'm going to stay away from my complaints for the time being just because the game IS in early access and will get those kinks ironed out in no time I'm sure

In the mean time I can't suggest the game more if you like cozy decorating games.... eeeeeeeeven if it means you might get your ass set on fire and have to stab the occasional Croco. And.... for some reason milk a Wombat which will never stop feeling weird to me.

You can keep animals, farm, fish, mine, cook, interact with wonderful NPCs...you name it!  You can also hunt a variety of Australian-themed animals.  Being a animal-loving vegetarian, this really bothered me at first.  But then I decided that if it's an animal trying to kill me, I will defend myself!  Take that Crocos and Bush Devils!!  Not all wild animals here are dangerous, many are benign, and you can even tame a diggo (dingo) and mu (emu.)  The game has incredible depth and is very addictive.  It will be a long, long time before I feel like I've done it all.  With a developer who is very engaged with his following and always taking suggestions for new additions, I don't see this game ever going stale.  James Bendon is the sole developer for Dinkum and I continuously shake my head in wonder at how he's done it.

+ The sound effects are all nice. Nothing sounds cheap!
+The graphics look really appealing. The game is simply beautiful and charming.
+ Rag-Doll Effects on death. It never gets old.
+ A ton of crafting providing many options to design your village in your own Style.
+ Sandbox game in its core. Means basically you can do whatever you want and you are your own Boss but your Main Goal remains to build a Community. Every new villager brings a new store. This is basically your progression.
+ Travel by land, water or air. You get the vehicles, you decide how to traverse.
+ Combat is simple but entertaining enough
+ No DLC nonsense - you get what you paid for

The only negative thing that i can say about this game is that you cant build your own buildings. All the houses come preset. You just set down where you want them, provide the materials and in 1-2 days its done but all in all its a very very good game! Im 70+ Hours in and i still didnt get all the villagers yet.

edit: okay had some good playtime in this so full review time

Pros; it's charming. the sound design is excellent, very soothing. Mechanics are mostly smooth. intuitive and simple to get to grips with. there's loads to do in the game with the variety of all the different types of collections keeping it from feeling too grindy. You can turn off the very annoying vocals/

Cons; saving is only when you end the day by going to sleep; not when the player wants it, which when the beta crashes can be annoying if you've done lots of things in the daytime and lose everything from the crash. 

What could make it amazing:
Either an auto-save or mini-progress save i.e. it just saves the last thing you did, not the rewards bit (that can be as it is). 
Change the Drop to say Drop / Plant  - that would be super useful. Some actions have dual purposes which isn't necessarily clear from the outset. Some of these are fun to find, others are a PITA.
A bit more info about what each licence gives you i.e. unlocks x y & z so then if you're trying to do something specific you don't waste credits on something you think might give you what you need only to be disappointed 

Overall this is a great game, I deeply enjoy the mechanics but the soundscape is what really really sells it. Being able to plug in at the end of a stressful day and listen to the asmr qualities of the sounds whilst playing a charming little game is 100% worth it.",1687796053,1688295696,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The multiplayer/co-op experience is also more robust than Animal Crossing as you not only can you visit each others' islands as you would in New Horizons, but you can also fully participate as a member of each others' islands as well. all-in-all, if you're an Animal Crossing fan and you're looking for any other game that even scratches that itch, Dinkum is the only one that I've ever found to do so.

it is worth mentioning that the game is an early access game made by only one guy. it's scope is still limited in some ways and there is more content to be added to make the game feel like a fuller experience. interestingly, all the NPCs in the game are people who have also function as town hall workers or store owners, so it's like if Tom Nook, Isabelle, Sable, Mable, etc. were also the only villagers in your Animal Crossing town, albeit with the ability to make small talk and ask for favors and such. I think having NPCs that could just be regular old townsfolk would be a nice addition, and fleshing out your island with neighborhoods of citizens would add some more depth to the game. in general, I hope the future content just gives the player more things to add to their town, both functioning and decorative, as after about 30 hours we're taking a bit of a break as well as waiting for some more content. but with all that said, at $20 Dinkum is more than worth the price.

also the game is Australian so all the NPCs say g'day mate.",1688275113,1688275113,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I still experience bugs as of this comment:
-Sometimes two fishes bite the rod, and both fish are pulling.
-When playing multiplayer, I always join my partner's server. Sometimes I go into an endless drop on Fletch's House.
-Most of the time on rainy days Crocs ignore you completely, even after hitting them.
-On Multiplayer, sometimes the crates are visually stuck on open.

[*]No dedicated key for Pause button.
[*]Cannot skip dialogue all together. You can fast forward it so that is a lot of clicks.
[*]Tedious repetitive dialogues to do the same activity again and again. Un-necessary follow up conversation - like I just want to buy my license and be done or sell my item for the 3 millionth time, why do I have to listen to the same follow up conversation that I cannot just one-key-press escape. 
[*]Small small small map.
Map is not built for transportation. Want to carry that Amber Chunk in your pocket? You can't - you can a whole engine that you found but you can't this particular item.

[*]Planting seeds - I don't know if I am doing this wrong, but planting a tree goes as such 1.Dig a hole. 2. drop a seed 3.Plug that hole with soil. Now if you want to do this say 400 times for a big tree farm imagine doing that over an over.  You can try putting down multiple seeds but they can get clubbed together and when you pick up one you pick up both. And if you drop two seeds - it won't just plant one and leave one be instead it won't plant at all.
[*]Game is not scaled to do massive projects. Want to expand the land? Or flatten it? Sure - you can do it one block at time. Which is fine - but your tool that degrades and eventually breaks if you over use it to the end. So better make 20 of these or just be ready to spend several days flattening a huge area. Or make 10 of those charging stations to keep cycling through them. 
[*]Again - Giant animals but not enough land to house them. Want to do a 100 wombat farm? You going to need a ton of land, but not for the animals silly. Its for the housing that shelters the animals.
[*] The whole petting the animal nonsense. Not a fan even once you are in possession of the musical instrument.
[*]Some tools break some you can recharge. Helmet - recharges does not break but any other powertool breaks? Why?
[*]Sleep to save system. Did you enjoy flattening that 2 mile long area that took you long time to flatten? Great you were so excited that forgot that tool was about to at its last usage and broke? No worries just don't save and start over. Yes you will have to do that whole flattening again.
[*]Flowers? Can we make colors out of this yet or not?
[*]Bats - fun to kill. Till you keep getting hordes of them while mining. Even with two bat-zappers you will run out of them. The game's philosophy is progression = 10x of the same item.
Anyway, spent ton of hours on this - but game still feels as tedious as it is on Day1 (IN-GAME) you would think after few years worth of days in game and pretty much unlocking everything it would be easier to do massive projects? But no. What is the end goal of this game if not that? It is not minecraft with procedural endless regeneration.

------------------------
The PC version of animal crossing, minus the long real-life wait times. 
You can keep customising your own village to your hearts desire and the one dev that is making this game keeps adding content to this game [b] and interacts with the community [/b]. There is a grind-aspect to it but it feels very natural, as you progress the grind dies down as you can automate a lot of the stuff. The graphics aren't anything mind-blowing but they are nice. Some bird sounds may sound low quality and the music may get repetitive after a while, but nothing a nice spotify list can't fix.

There's not a lot of depth when it comes to npcs and story. The main interaction you will have with npcs is by completing request for them. ""bring me fish/food/furniture/clothing or can i buy this from you/do you want to buy this from me?""
Requests are worth it to get new items/blueprints, but you don't learn anything about the npcs by doing them. It also has a frustrating relationship decay mechanics.

Then there's building. That's where the game shines. You can place npcs houses wherever you want, you can build wherever and whatever you want. The main drawback is the fact that you can't create roofs (due to coding, one √≠tem per title) community found a workaround by using bridges as roofs, but It's not a perfect solution.

Creative ppl will have a blast, and can spend tonsss of time on this game. I spent 100hrs and I only created like 5% of things I wanted to make.
Building aside, the game feels pretty lifeless. So if you try to focus on anything but building you might get bored and rather disappointed with this title.",1687644045,1687677089,True,52,1,0.81206125020980835,0,True,False,True

I would say it's 8.5/10 with the only things stopping it from being higher for me can mostly be boiled down to ""Early Access jank"". Detailed ramblings that resemble a review below.

I am a veteran Harvest Moon, AC, Rune Factory etc player based in Australia. These games are my Vegemite (or I suppose, Mighty, in Dinkum's case) on toast. This game to me is worth full price right now with the amount of content it has, and with more major updates on the way. Obviously, it has its bugs and flaws as most Early Access games tend to, but most of the time, it's nothing making sure your saves are backed up won't fix.

The main thing that helps Dinkum stand out and shine is the setting for sure. Many people, Aussie and not, I've streamed the game for have said ""wow, this is exactly how I imagine a HarvestCrossing Australian Flavoured game to be"". While Dinkum isn't necessarily a ""lore heavy"" game like some others in the genre, I really like the little tidbits we hear about the world ""before things went South"" and about ""South City"" as we have people move to our island and befriend them. Essentially, the premise of Dinkum is the world has gone South (aka to Jackaroo Poo), and Fletch, an elderly woman, puts out an ad one day about a once-in-a-lifetime chance to get out of South City that you the player are the only one who takes interest in. She tells you about the island, which is where her father lived many years ago, and provides you his old journal (which functions as your ""achievement"" system and progression tracking namely) and you get on an airship and go from there!

The overall ""mechanics"" of the game are incredibly familiar with, but there are things like the licenses, and Franklyn's shop, that are distinct enough that it's hard for me to 1:1 compare Dinkum to another game mechanically, or for me to say that it feels ""too similar"" to another game. One thing I like and wish was more common in the Harvest Moon series is when you make meals at your cooking table, they all have certain unique buffs! These buffs both make it easier to do that action and also affect your EXP. For example, if a food has a sword and a shield icon in it, that means it buffs your attack and defense. On the note of combat, for anyone expecting the game to be combat heavy, you will likely be disappointed to hear the combat is fairly basic and not necessarily a required part of the game until you start getting into the endgame. But that doesn't bother me personally, if I want a more combat heavy game in the genre, I'll go play RF4 or SDV. My favourite part of the progression would have to be the things you unlock via Franklyn, especially things like the motorbike or helicopter (which is a cool 3 million dinks and many Shiny Disc sacrifices :P). Yes, you read that right, the money is literally called Dinks :D

Regarding co-op/multiplayer, it can be a bit buggy and janky at certain points, but for the most part I like how it is. The only major gripe I have about it is if we want to pause, the only way to do that it seems is by ending the day (which for reference Dinkum days are about 30 mins irl time if you use the full day). Aside from that, I like the travel bag system (a ""global"" backpack for taking things to others islands) and the fact that it's easy to avoid getting burned if you're trading because of how the save system works (which is, the game only saves when you start a new day). I know some people have complaints it's not ""true"" co-op, in the sense of it isn't it's own separate save or mode, but rather you take your character and your items in your inventory and travel bag to someone's island, or they come to yours. However, you can still work on things for your own island on someone else's, such as your relationship/hearts progression with NPCs or doing things like bug catching, fishing, mining etc. etc. to work on your ""exp"" for those skills, so it's not like co-op not being hosted on your island is a detriment to you, especially because time won't progress on your island while you're on someone else's, it only progresses their day. I get the complaints and if this is a deal breaker for you that is understandable, given how games like SDV have much more refined co-op/multiplayer comparatively. At the same time it is only in Early Access, so this may change once the game releases, especially since the Developer has said he would like to work on bringing Dinkum to non-PC platforms once the game is officially ""done"" and released out of Early Access (this is in the FAQs on the community Discord). 

The only negative for me personally is the fishing is a biiiit janky, which is a relatively common ""negative"" people cite. I actually preferred the old button mash system as a controller player though I understand the reasoning for the minor rework. The main reasons I wanted to call this out are because 1) fishing is how you get the current anniversary event currency, and 2) fishing one of the ways you can make a lot of Dinks, and is pretty easy to do so especially once you have the jetski and the Fishing Book from Theodore's Museum. I haven't heard many people say they actively *like* the fishing system, so do be prepared for some minor frustrations in that department.",1687329983,1687330188,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

Once you get to the ""end game"" you realise there is nothing to do, there is zero incentive to do anything in this game.

The updates are just time buffers that add just more things onto your to do list but are seldom fun or creative in anyway. What is the point in a sandbox that offers no reward and is hollow? This game has so much potential but the road map is boring and un-innovative. Every new thing is just more work and it creates this time wasting simulator.

Stardew valley handles this problem so well, even talking about Stardew makes me want to replay it again but this game ... you just have an overwhelming feeling of dread that prevents you from exploring this hollow husk of what could be a GREAT game but instead all you have is a copy and paste cash grab that makes you feel like a chump for buying into it

I remember asking about this a long time ago and I was told it was temporary and seasonal events would eventually be tied to the in-game calendar. It has yet to happen and I'm doubtful it's going to. This isn't a live service game so this is just bad design.

The worst decision though was to have heart levels (NPC affinity) reduce over time. I put in a ton of time doing fetch quests for the NPCs to get them to 5 hearts. Now you want me to do it every day or they stop liking me? There's a reason SDV, Sun Haven, SOS/Harvest Moon, or any other game in this genre doesn't do this. It's beyond bad design. It takes what was a chill, cozy game and turns it into a nightmare of chasing down NPCs constantly to do never ending fetch quests for them.

James, with all due respect, crawl out of your circle jerk of a Discord server and stop letting those suck ups who worship you feed you one bad idea after another. You have one of the best chill games on Steam right now and you're making it tedious for no reason. It may not hurt your overwhelmingly positive rating immediately but if you start reading the Steam forums again you'll see the growing frustration with your recent choices. It's only a matter of time until it hurts Dinkum's rating.

Original Review:

I have only played single player so far. This game is full of bugs. I haven't had any game breaking ones yet but there are definitely clipping issues. Combat is clunky and a feature to toggle lock onto a target would probably solve the issue. For some reason, the pause button is in the options sub menu making pausing the game inefficient but it was recently implemented so I'm glad it exists at all (although having pause bound to one of the many unused keys would be far better or even stopping time when the menu opens). As far as I can tell, there is no way to rebind keys. 

Despite the issues, this game is very fun. I'm enjoying leveling my skills, earning points, selling goods, unlocking new crafting recipes, and shaping the landscape. The systems in play are so well thought out and implemented that they outshine the flaws. Dinkum is well worth the asking price.",1659850514,1687230866,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

100hrs in and still finding new things, and have a list of things to unlock, but that's the beauty of this game, take it at your own pace, fast or slow, it's up to you. But the more you engage, the more fun you seem to have.

A day is roughly 30-45 min, so you'll need multiples of that to play. Unlock initially can be slow (and at times a little perplexing), but there are guides galore when you get a little stuck. But I think the pace of the unlocks are about right.

Combat gets progressively easier as soon as you learn the move sets; and assuming you remember to heal up...  The vehicles are all quite fun and have their moments;

*Will never play this game again*

I truly loved this game so much, to the extent that I was a community moderator on the official Discord server for 8 months, starting before the game even launched. At the end of the day I really just have to say that the people that I gave so much of my time and heart to, turned out to be some of the most awful and unkind people that I have had the displeasure of working with. Some of the staff are still good people, but one by one the best and hardest working members of the team have been forced right out of the community. 

It's been a few months now and I have moved on with my life, but I now have maybe half a dozen friends who have had such deeply negative experiences that they will never play the game again, both general community members and former staff.

1 - Please!!! make it so when you open a menu it paused the game. I don't want to have to go to the tittle screen every time I need to step away from the game and loose everything I did since the start of the day. And when I need to step away isn't always at night when I sleep. 
2 - Similarly, it's not okay that animals can attack me when I am in a cut scene. An alligator attack me when I was speaking with the grandma when we arrived on the island. I was also attacked when I was looking at the board with the demand or when I had just catch a bug and it played the cute animation. 
3 - I got no info on how to drive the wheelbarel so I was just confused until i try everything on my controler. I think leaving the player figure some things outs is nice, but I don't think this is one of them, since it is specific to this game and no one will instinctively know how to do it. 

Overall, this game will be great, but I think I will wait a bit so those issues are fixed and then played more. I hope the developpers are aware of the first two problems the most and fix it or the game will just be more annoying than fun for me.

I definitely think the available materials in the world should be optimized so a beginner wouldn't find it so hard to find certain ores, such as tin and copper, that are needed to progress further into the game. It can get a bit frustrating to run around looking for tin because Fletch asked me to go get some and find out it's a bit of a long walk from camp, which certainly wouldn't be a problem if the tin ores were many. If it were then walking that far would be justified but that's not really the case here. (I generated two worlds and encountered the same problem. Sure, I might just be picking bad locations but even then, common ores should be, well, common).

It's also worth mentioning that the excavation mechanic in this game is very clever because you can't just shovel a piece of dirt and then forget about it, you're gonna have to find a place to dump that dirt onto. Seems simple enough but as someone who played Minecraft for years, it was a welcome albeit troublesome change in game play. 

Yet as much as I find the excavation in this game wonderful, I truly do hope that there would be an easier way to terraform your world. Maybe a vehicle that would flatten dirt and eliminate the trouble of having to find a place to dump dirt onto would be really great. All in all, it's a good game! I'm looking forward to sinking more hours into this but knowing what I know now, I personally wouldn't buy this game during Early Access. 

Nevertheless, it's still an 8/10 for me. James Bendon did great on this one :))",1673879745,1686782935,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Don't get me wrong the game is good and people that like this kind of game will enjoy it.
But unfortunately, the coop part of the game is not truly coop. 

You can't share money or points for example. So it makes you feel like coop is 1 + 1 rather 2. The host and the ""helper"".

It feels like you are 2 solo players in the same game, like you don't have any option to have a meaningful impact on the host island (make it possible in the island multiplayer settings).

I would DEFINITLY play the game if coop was more meaningful !

Dinkum is a beautifully wholesome game with a fresh blend of unique & familiar game styles. The simplicity in the game ui & character controls makes it easy to pick up and hard to put down. You can lose many hours of your life in this game and not regret a single second of it.
I'm a particularly a big fan of the animals and interactions with them the game offers. So many other games of this nature go for fantasy or more western animals so to play with Australian animals is refreshing and just as adorable as usual. Pick up a guitar and -bam- you've got the cutest audience for your little performance. 
The game doesn't hold back when it comes to the survival elements, a backpack full of grub is often needed to get from one place to another. Angry critters will run after you too, I find the encounters engaging but never too difficult for me to manage. 
Overall, Dinkum is chock full of endearing qualities all put together in a bright and eye-catching graphic design, James has done a truly wonderful job creating this game. There are things that could be improved but this game is in early access so I'll give it the benefit of ""maybe eventually it will all work out""
For a game that is very new it runs very smoothly and with few bugs, I can safely say it's one of the best early access games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.

Here's where we get to the *but*...
Whilst I would recommend the game I'd advise extreme caution when engaging with the online Dinkum community. I met some of the most amazing people and truly felt I'd found somewhere I belonged, but it was short lived. I was one of a group of people accused of being ""too helpful"" and was very confused and upset. When I did eventually gather myself and make a heartfelt apology I was responded to with a message that started ""I'm not reading that"" and then banned. I'm still under the belief that there was severe misunderstanding and miscommunication from both myself & the admin team but this thing isn't what upsets me the most. When I say I met amazing people I do truly mean it, and those amazing people were also cut off and bullied out of the server. I've heard some horrible things about what happens behind the scenes and the bias certain people show towards others, I have seen messages from the community manager that I would never expect anyone to send let alone somebody in charge of a massive network of gamers (some of which were/are incredibly vulnerable). With all of this some of our friends reached out to James himself and he made it clear that he supports the actions of this CM and so I feel I cannot support the game anymore.
I loved this game, adored it, I put so much of myself into it and dedicated myself to helping others wherever I could, but now when I even look at it in my games menu I feel sick to the core. Not only was it an extremely traumatic and upsetting time for me but the way that my friends and other community members have been treated upsets me greatly. 
A game as beautiful and accepting as this should have a community that reflects that, instead it's caused harm to a group of people who were only trying to help and engage. 
Download the game, have the most amazing time because I promise you 100% you will. Catch fish, grow wheat, ride a bike into the river (trust me it's far too easy to ride a bike into a river). My god the world has been waiting for a game like this for way too long... but maybe give that invite to the discord a miss.",1686059485,1686059485,False,60,3,0.697845160961151123,0,True,False,True

I haven't played for a few months and it is doubtful that I will ever play this game again. 
I would recommend the game to anyone in a heartbeat but the community not so much anymore.
Myself and a few people I met through the Discord server were told to stop talking and helping people as it is not our job to tell someone how to do something. 2 of the Helpers that I am quite close friends with have been removed from helpers because the community manager prefers a team full of bullies than people who actually help.

We have tried to talk to the dev about this and he has been sent a few messages but we were told he doesn't see that his CM is doing anything wrong, when she is bulling people out of a server because they don't act in a way she deems appropriate. She banned my friend for Online bullying when the only people in the server who are bullies is the CM herself and at least 1 of her staff members. 

The game is beautiful and so well done, It makes me sad that 1 person ruined it all for me. I have never belonged to a community for a game before and I was so happy to have found Dinkum and its server. Now its all sour.
I will recommend the game to anyone but the discord server I would stay away from because they will ruin your love for this game and it is such a shame after all the hardwork James has put in, the person who runs his community will be the reason so many people stop playing.",1675079943,1686039848,False,7,0,0.578358352184295654,0,True,False,True

Your enjoyment is bound by your creative limitations, as well as limitations in building (i.e. bridge placement, lack of certain types of decorations.) Early access with a community-feedback-driven developer (yes, just one dev), so I'm sure we'll get more stuff eventually :)

The first thing is that every time you die every tool in your inventory takes a hit. The lower the item the bigger the hit. Which means you are constantly buying new tools. Second, Copper is too hard to find, and you need it for everything. I don't like that in order to make an iron tool, you need to make a copper one first. I wouldn't mind it so much, if the tools did not break all the time. The third thing is that if you are playing a multiplayer game, there is no way to lock chests. Which means anyone you have come on your land in multiplayer, can take anything and bring it back to their own town. Last the fourth reason is the shovel is a pain in the butt!! If you get a scoop, you have to put down a scoop somewhere. Its very hard to flatten the land, if you want to add a fence.

The freedom to do so, while this place you create is also inhabited by other people to make the world feel less empty, is a great adition.

So what can make it better? A few ideas came into my mind, but I don't intend them as complaint, just as an inspiration:
Maybe tourists a few more residents would come - how about some workers to hire for farming, mining and fishing, musicians, writer/poets, artists as friend of the guy running the museum, a pilot/ferryman for the residents? Or the possibility to run a streetfood-stall, where you can sell your stuff to the residents? It also would be nice, if someone with interior decoration ambitions could change the interior and the exterior of the residents houses. And how about family members of the residents, like old parents or brothers and sisters? Granny can't be the only old person on the island...

I already have tons of ideas and plans for builds in this save file, AND for future restarts.

Also, a tip for anyone starting the game - I recommend growing an orchard as soon as possible if you want to make your earliest days last longer than bed at 2pm, haha! I have a group of fruit trees (5x5) which grow fruit on different days, so I have a constant food supply to keep my stamina up!

The fishing mechanic is a little hard to learn at first, but it is fun in a challenging way. The deep mine is pretty deadly, at least for me. I'm not much into the combat, and having everything in there all out to get you nearly at once is too much for me.

I grew up playing Harvest Moon 64, and once I eventually got into PC gaming, I found myself searching around every year or so for something similar, and eventually there was Stardew Valley, which is now my personal favorite game of all time.

Since then, I've had a hard time finding another farm/life sim that I can really get lost in. I have tried quite literally all of them, and some came close to really drawing me in for the long haul, like My Time at Portia, and Kynseed, but they all seemed to lack that certain X factor that made the game a permanent staple of my library.

But this game? This game fully slaps. It's another game well above the rest, sitting up near Stardew, but where exactly it ranks will be made clear with more play time. I'll update as I go.

EDIT:

After nearly tripling my play time since my initial review, and playing a few games that have come out in the same vein since then, I think I have a fair grasp on the overall quality of the game.

If you like decorating and is concerned about filling your island up too fast, don't worry! Your island is MASSIVE! There's so much land to explore that you couldn't finish decorating or laying everything out within a short period of time. There's also lots of recipes and items to discover as well as visitors to bring to your island.

One of my favourite things is DInkum's online co-op. You can have up to 4 players per island, AND there's no restriction to what you and your friends can do on each other islands. It's a great help especially when you go down to the mines, need to fight an alpha or even to get materials around the island. 

Overall, for the price of this game it is well worth your money. There's endless stuff to do and lots of tips and tricks to learn along the way!",1685118013,1685118013,True,1,0,0.505723178386688232,0,True,False,True

I have three Animal Crossing saves, each with hundreds of hours. The graphics in Dinkum are not as nice, but the game... You can swim and dive in the rivers. You can take a boat far out into the ocean. Hang gliding!

There is just so much to do, and the game is still early access. Highly recommended.

Update May 2023:
Months later, I'm still playing.

I did burn out for a while. There is a lot of grinding. At one point I just lost interest because it was going to take me real world months to move in 5 residents. At that point the game was not fun for me. I finally decided to use some sparing dev commands to get myself to a place where it was enjoyable.

I'm not a fan of combat, so I've only been in the mines once. I will probably add the peaceful mining mod.

I'm not a fan of hunting, either. I scavenge all my meat. I do kill the crocodiles that come after me. I've done a few alpha quests. But just not a fan of this part of the game, so I mostly ignore it. 

I've got 170 hours so far, so there is plenty to do if you are not a fan of combat and hunting. I actually restarted after realizing just how terrible my original map was.",1662607186,1684717908,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The crafting, the cooking, the fishing, the friendly interaction with NPCs. I love the bulletin board and the various quests it offers. There are a couple of things I would love to have changed, however... 1) is to be able to skip out of conversations with one click or hotkey. It becomes wearisome to have to go through every step of dialogue with every character interaction... 2) would be to enable ""tabbing"" with a hotkey when you open your progress book. Having to click on the tabs with the mouse also gets a bit tedious. Other than that, no complaints. (These aren't really complaints as much as thoughts for the developers to mull over in their minds.) I love the deep mine and when I get enough ruby shards I will go even deeper!

Single player has the advantage that you have all the things to yourself, and you can plan the town as you like.  Multiplayer allows for more extensive mining in the Deep Mine and safe recovery when you get incapacitated. The Deep Mine is important when working with more than one player. I am annoyed with Multiplayer only due to the fact that if you are a guest on multiplayer (and not the host) you cannot compete building objectives like the host can.

Still in Early Access but already so much to do, collect and build. 
Cons; movement can take some practice as it's square by square in the direction you're facing, so it can get a bit frustrating sometimes when you are aiming at things, and can make combat annoying when trying to dodge attacks. 
Days are also very short.  By the time you do some basic maintenance around your town the day's half gone, and some of the vendors have very short opening hours, so if you need to shop don't go far before you can visit them.

1: Manual Save Functionality - Probably the only real annoyance I have is that the only way to save the game (aside from using the debug console cheats) is by sleeping to end the day. Often I will do the ""morning routine"" of watering crops, tending to animals, getting the NPC daily tasks, etc., which will usually take until mid-afternoon. There's still a lot of time left in the day to go into the deep mines, go out and collect materials, etc., but I sometimes will be pulled away or just want to stop, and I have to choose between just ending the day there or redoing it all. I strongly believe there should be a way to save the game without ending the day.

2: Bugs and Fish in Containers - I feel that bugs and fish should be able to be stored in containers. It was annoying to have to go get a specific one when an NPC requested it, when I had previously caught it and had to sell/drop it to make room (this was before learning you can place them on the ground. However, this still gets cluttered when you have a lot of them, and it can get hard to tell which is which). Perhaps special containers can be locked behind licenses or bought from Franklyn or Julia.

3: Crafting and Automation - Some of the first mods I look for in games with crafting systems are mods for inventory management and crafting automation. By the end of the first in-game year, I had a lot of chests, and just one day in the deep mines could net up to 200 ore. I think it could be satisfying to have some options for improved crafting and processing. Perhaps some Franklyn commissions for a special crafting table that pulls from boxes that are in specific squares, special boxes that feed into adjacent production items, etc.

4: Wheelbarrow - I think the wheelbarrow has extremely limited uses currently. It is nice if you want to transport dirt a small distance, but that usually isn't something I've needed, and by the time I did, I had the dirt printer. I think if the wheelbarrow could place its contents in the square in front of it one at a time, it could serve as a nice in-between before you have the dirt printer, and it would have a lot more utility.

5: Silos - Placing animal feed into silos should require a single click to place the entire stack you're holding. There is no reason to place them one at a time, and it is tedious to have to click 200 times to completely fill one. Even just topping one off after a few days of use kind of defeats the purpose of it automatically filling the feeders if you have to click the same number of times anyway.

6: Crab Pots - Currently, crab pots feel pretty disappointing. Being locked behind the 3000 perk point fishing license and requiring a total of 35 ore *per pot* is a lot. Then, each requires some meat to bait every day (which really adds up when you make a lot of them), and each only catches a single item per day, which is usually a common item you could get a bunch of anyway. It either shouldn't be able to catch anything other than some of the more rare critters, should catch multiple things per day, or it should cost much less to craft. For similar materials, you could just make an animal pen and get consistently more valuable items to sell from processing animal products and spend 1 animal feed per day instead of 1 meat.

All this being said, most of these points are addressed by mods (bless this game's modding community), and again the game is still very fun and engaging (I also love the soundtrack!). I hope James sees this and takes these points into consideration.",1684175856,1684175856,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Everywhere I look it says it's individual player progress, which is not the case, the individual player receives tickets but the donations count towards the hosts progression and prevents the host from being able to donate the same creature.

If players do not load into the next day before the host quits, all player progress is lost.

Combat breaks quite frequently in multiplayer sessions.
Fishing is best done when you're not the host as latency allows fishing to become redundant, bring the lure close to you and 1 click on bite and fish is caught - this is for some reason, not a viable tactic as a host, the fish bites, you act as if you catch something, but receive nothing using this tactic *as a host*

This is a very fun game for Animal Crossing fans, it just needs a lot of TLC and polish, though I fear that some of these bugs, as they are well known and have existed for some time, are embedded in the core code of the game and won't be fixed soon, if ever.

- Can have and pet doggos 10/10
- Can have and pet chickens 9/10, would love if chickens could hatch from eggs
- Cute animals and farming 10/10
- Realism in terms of energy/time/food/etc 8/10, time should pass a little slower sometimes, especially when 
   you're trying to do multiple things or explore the mines
- The basic survival actvities: hunting, fishing, building a town, collecting materials 10/10

The map 8/10, would prefer if it was a live map and shows buildings/trees/landmarks of towns, etc; although it does show paths and uneven grounds++

Extra activities: mining (now with the second mining level), treasure hunting, metal detectors, the deep mine 10/10 always got somethingto do

The gameplay 10/10 well paced game, no actual lore that needs to be followed, no motion sickness, very nintendo and animal crossing styled

The customization 10/10 can customize characters, houses, vehicles, towns, etc; can now create signs

The game's island setting, inspired by the rugged Australian outback, is simply breathtaking. I loved exploring every nook and cranny, foraging, fishing, mining, and farming for resources. The game creates an immersive experience that lets you truly feel like you're living off the land.

But what really sets Dinkum apart is the ability to interact with the island's people. It's like stepping into a little community, where everyone has their own story to tell. It's heartwarming and charming, and I found myself getting lost in the stories and the characters.

The game's relaxing soundtrack is the cherry on top. It's the perfect accompaniment to the island's tranquil atmosphere, and it's the kind of music you can just sit back and listen to for hours.

Overall, I give Dinkum a rating of 9 out of 10. It's a well-crafted game that immerses you in a world of simplicity and tranquility.

Pros: The game is moddable, which trust me, it needs it! There's several issues with the game that modders fortunately solved. God bless the modding community, I tell ya.

The game has good regional pricing (for the most part)

Cons: The game only has a singular save file AND the game ONLY saves when you go to sleep at the end of the day. Now, considering that you can spend upwards of 30minutes on a single day, this means that if the game were to crash at any time during the day, then you lose ALL that progress made during the day and lose all loot. And since the game crashes every so often, that means you're going to lose hours of gameplay if you invest any meaningful amount of time into playing the game. The dev could easily fix this by implementing a save system that ISN'T straight out of the year 1995.

A single butterfly/spider/etc. takes up a whole inventory slot, but you can have 20 engines on 1 inventory slot. Makes sense?

Because of the above inventory stacking design decision, the inventory is far too small, and it rightfully should be increased by at least 10 spaces.

Weapons/Tools/etc. break when they reach zero durability, meaning you lose them forever.

Your stamina/energy bar comes 1/10th of the size when you go past 00:00 at night, and you LOSE all stamina that you had above that line. A [u]MUCH[/u] better mechanic would be to instead simply not allow the player to recoup their stamina after the 00:00 time.

Bats in the mines don't give any loot, ever. They're the only thing in the game that doesn't give loot AND they're the only thing in the game that can't be hit by weapons in a straight forward fashion. Two things that make no sense in the logic of the game.

There's some special animals in the game, like Radioactive Crocs for instance, but these animals give no special loot besides the regular Croc loot. This is pretty stupid imo as there's zero incentive to hunt these special animals.",1682791662,1682918417,True,4,0,0.299727290868759155,0,True,False,True

The master volume slider starts at around 30%, which is fantastic - can every game be like this please?

Regarding the 'recommendation' for this game - I am refunding it; it's not one I see myself playing in the long term (plus the sounds were really bothering me). That said..

tl;dr : It tries its hardest to be Animal Crossing, but just isn't - though it certainly feels like it's well on that path. Maybe with some quality-of-life updates it can get a lot closer, but - wasn't for me. To be fair, I was never the biggest Animal Crossing player to begin with - so if you were, it may be more palatable.

Good:
(1) Serious Animal Crossing [Switch]/Nintendo vibes - if you enjoyed that game, this one is very likely up your alley - at least with regards to the graphics/ui/overall feel of the game off the bat.

Bad:
(1) The sound effects - the developers sure love their extremely high-pitched/grating sounds, for everything. List: [UI menu clicks for everything/Pickaxe mining sound/even the occasional footstep sound] - they're all just... incredibly irritating, like nails on a chalkboard.
(2) The inventory system - like Animal Crossing, it offers a toolbar+backpack organization of your items. That itself isn't bad, but - unlike Animal Crossing, there is no rotating through your backpack/toolbars - there's only a singular bar you can put things on. I found myself CONSTANTLY having to open up the backpack and move things around, which as a controller player was just time-consuming/obnoxious. Seriously, just do it the way Animal Crossing [Switch] does, and it'd feel SO much better.
(3) Selling items - there's no way to see how much each item sells for, as a single unit, or as a stack; when you hover over your items at a merchant, or try to find them in the informational menus. You select everything you want to sell, and John just gives you a price - that's it. I'm sure I could sell him one item at a time and note how much each thing sells for - but come on, that's unrealistic.",1682906264,1682906421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Dinkum is a charming, creative, well executed title. It is essentially Animal Crossing style gameplay, in a little Australian world. A delight to play and addictive to those who don‚Äôt mind a little grind.

Speaking of grind, the grind in early game won‚Äôt last forever, Dinkum manages to balance the work / reward mechanic to near perfection. Work hard, reap the benefits and when everything seems to be in abundance, there‚Äôs still a lot to do. 

Negatives? Honestly, I love it so much it‚Äôs difficult to come up with any. It is in early access, so there‚Äôs a few bugs, but they‚Äôre far from terrible (and the dev is very in touch with community feedback).

It will be a long speech, in which I will explain some details and say the missing things

The movement of the camera is unique in this game and smooth, and the smoothness of the game even in entering and exiting buildings at high speed without a loading screen is a beautiful thing that I cannot describe accurately

The graphics of the game are beautiful and cartoony, not exaggerated, such as trying to reach realism, because games always fail in that, except rarely

Everyone in the city has special interests and also different working times, and you can chat with them and give you advice or tell their life stories (the dialogues will be special at the beginning of the game and become repeated later), and you can befriend any individual and go out with them, but before that you must carry out several tasks for them in order for the love meter to increase And they become your friends, but their programming is not good. Unfortunately, I sometimes have problems with them, such as delay in reactions.

In short, the game will be excellent, like the first 30, 40, 50, or 60 hours, after which you will notice a lack of activities and repetition of tasks, but it is not a big problem, especially since the game is early access.

Here are the missing things that I wish were present in the game

The map becomes larger and more diverse, and there are different cities in it that you cannot modify. You only deal with them, such as trading or buying from their stores, and their products are different from those of your city, so that you are encouraged to go to them.

More diversity in environments, changing the desert from red to beige, adding a snowy and mountainous area and a green area

When winter came, I wished that the land, trees, and buildings would be covered with snow, and the lighting of the game would change to be more white, and in the fall, the leaves would fall and fill the land, and the sunlight would be orange

Add more wild animals such as bears, lions, hyenas, etc

Adding legendary animals whose sizes are larger and more difficult to hunt, and that there is a shop that buys the skins or heads of these animals from you at high prices to encourage hunting them and their places differ such as land, seas and sky, on land, for example, there will be a bear, and in the sea, for example, it will be Megaldon, and in the sky will be the eagle

Adding a larger and wider aquatic life, and the possibility of buying a diving suit or a submarine to explore it, or to catch more or larger fish

Adding more modifications to the houses, more colors, and adding a garage

Add NPCs Interact in town

Adding more mini games, for example, an arcade game store, or any fun side activity

Adding dinosaur fossils to the museum, and the bones are collected and restored by the player

I apologize for the prolongation. The bottom line is that the game has great potential, and the more developers are interested in their game, the more and more the success of the game will be. Therefore, I hope to add continuous updates, whether new or to fix glitch.",1682628657,1682628657,True,9,0,0.575594663619995117,2,True,False,True

The animations are adorable, and the hunting of animals is fun. 

The biggest issue for this game is the lack of being able to pause. In Animal Crossing it makes sense you wouldn't be able to pause as it runs on real time. However, in a game that runs on a timer much like Story of Seasons or Stardew Valley this is a big hindrance.

However, there are several areas in which the game falls short. 

Co-op:
Co-op is advertised as a true co-op experience, but in reality, your friends are limited to acting as sidekicks with minimal interactions in your world. If you started together on one island, your friends will miss out on important blueprints and story and town progress and they don't share your quests rewards, all of this can make the co-op mode feel less rewarding and less immersive than it could be.

Controls:
Controls are unnatural and feels wrong leading to numerous frustrating moments where you accidentally pick up furniture instead of using it, or find yourself doing multiple loops before marking the exact spot they need whether you want to catch a bug or remove some dirt.

Combat:
The combat system is also clunky and lacks depth. you will quickly tire of the repetitive button-mashing and the lack of options leads to the combat quickly becomes boring.

I think the best way to play this game is by playing solo, only then everyone can fully experience the game's content and mechanics without feeling held back by the limitations of the co-op mode. And by joining friends only when needed, players can still enjoy the social aspect of the game without sacrificing their own progress or enjoyment.

Maybe by implementing a shared world or realm system similar to Minecraft, players would be able to fully experience the co-op mode without feeling limited by the game's current setup. Allowing players to travel back to their own island to retrieve gear or finish missions would also give them more agency and control over their own progress, which is important for keeping players engaged and invested in the game.

Don't get me wrong, the game is fun... but how much fun it is, really depends on you. Being able to interact with an entire town of characters in Stardew just adds so much more. In Dinkum you get a museum... Okay, cool. But there's absolutely no incentive to fill that museum. I ""explored"" my entire island within the first few days of being on the island, and to be honest, it's just repetitive. I'm sure I'm missing something. I can only catch so many butterflies, and kill so many of the same creatures over and over and over. Nothing is new. I'm guessing there's what? 15 creatures to kill... max?

Interesting tech tree grinds with their respective machines and a fast paced dungeon dive system.  So Animal Crossing + My Time at Portia/Sandrock, essentially. Maybe a lesser relative to Stardew Valley; Dinkum is less complicated, I would say.

 Comes with functional multiplayer which is a hit with my 4 and 6 year old. The game can be challenging but also provides easy tasks for younger players.

Cons: the gatekeeping of basic skills via the certification system (basically nook miles in AC). You start with bug catching and being able to pick up stuff off the ground but you can't buy tools until you get a few in game days worth of certificate tickets.

Basically Stardew Valley as if running on Animal Crossing: New Horizons, with Minecraft sprinkled in. The different inspirations work together well, greater than the sum of its parts.

My main gripes with AC:NH (you are beholden to the passage of time) is fixed here by days being shorter than real time. My issues with Stardew Valley time (things being locked to seasons) is much looser here by having many more things unrelated to time of year. And unlike Minecraft's quicksandbox where there's just too much for me to take in all at once, Dinkum instead is more quality over quantity and there are things to dabble in and when I find I like it, jump right in.

Multiplayer works fantastically. I've only played with one other person so far, but there have been no major issues with desyncing. A few scattered oddities (fishing lag, duplicated NPCs), but nothing that can't just be laughed off.

The Spring Update added lovely flowers, another (more dangerous) mine type, a super useful restaurant NPC, and all sorts of lovely new items.

- First off, the map environment is (shall we say) quite ""small"" for such a large map. Passing the Ocean boundaries does literally...nothing. When reaching ""???"" boundaries (open the map to know if you're there), there's literally nothing out there. It feels like an endless, 2-block high water seas with nothing but you, your boat, and the vast horizon. I'm guessing there's going to be something added there later in the future updates?
- Adding to the first ""dislike"" reason, there are some ""height"" issues with the ocean. I found out that some of the water areas are either higher or lower than the normal height of the ocean, either by one block higher or one or two blocks lower. This can cause your boat to fall into the water, unable to use it. There is no way to break and obtain the sunken boat, since you CANNOT USE ANY TOOLS IN THE WATER. Once it is sunk...it's permanently sunken. The boat marker in the map is still showing where it was left at. If luck, you can lure a shark to break it for you? Unfortunately, that all depends on the random spawn rate.
- All the level experiences seem fine (Mining, Logging, Fishing, etc,), All, except Farming. From some certain sources that I've found, I noticed that you can't level up the Farming until you obtained the Watering Can and Hoe from a certain NPC. The Crafting Table, unfortunately, does not give you a recipe to craft them. So, sadly enough, you'll have to wait for that NPC to visit your island in order to obtain them and start Farming. It would be nice if the first Farming License would give you the crafting recipes to make them.
- There are some Favors that require you to not be able to make them in time or is ""too early"". One favor, by Fletch, wants me to cook a Pavlova, which requires impossible things to finish in one day (you can only do one Favor per NPC for just a day before resetting). Sugar and Big Chicken Egg, two of three ingredients to make a Pavlova, are impossible to obtain early in the game. Sugar can only be obtained from the Sugar Cane placed in a Grain Mill (in which you have to craft it, if you don't have it yet), while Big Chicken Egg can only be obtained by waiting for a Chook (Dinkum name for ""Chicken"") to lay it if they're very happy. Sugar Canes can be bought by Rayne, who (if you're still in the early game) is just visiting the island until you make a permanent deed for her. Chooks can be bought by Irene, who (once again if you're in early game) is just visiting the island until you make a permanent deed for him. Simply put: ALL OF THESE TAKES ALOT OF TIME, BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY TO FINISH. And yes: Fletch gave me her Pavlova favor in my early game, so there was nothing I can do for her (and it was a waste of a day).
- The controls are really lacking, especially the camera. Sadly enough, there's no zoom distance, in case for closer inspection or screenshotting a nice view of the landscape. Even the mouse also has a problem for ""staying in the center"" when selecting choices.

Here are some ""Liked"" reasons:
- The fishing can be a bit of a hassle, especially if there's no fish present. However, the mechanics are enjoyable when catching fishes.
- Breaking furnitures and structures (bridges, for example) can be re-usable, rather than breaking them into a few materials. I don't like my work to be re-made for naught, especially when some materials are scarce.
- Obtaining Permit Points from Milestone achievements can be satisfying, considering they're like currencies for ""upgrading"" yourself to learn something new or more.
- Some food gave you some semi-permanent health and/or stamina boost, which is quite useful for tough enemies in the island. Unfortunately, it resets back to normal the next day.
- This is sort of a ""Dislike"" reason, but: The durability on the tools are a pain to hold, considering if (for example) you see some Copper Rocks but your pickaxe is about to break. Then again, there's a Milestone achievement for your tools breaking, so I guess it's fine with me. The only tool that has no durability is the Watering Can (replaces durability to how much water it can hold), which is a sigh of relief, since buying another Watering Can from Rayne is too much ($15,000 for a Watering Can, if I'm correct).",1682043847,1682043847,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

At first I thought this looked to be a MySim adaptation but I've been pleasantly surprised over the past 55 hours.  The game itself is a town sim with animal crossing/Stardew valley -esque tasks and dailies. The different aspects such as Fishing, Farming, Bug catching, Mining, Metal detecting are unique especially when it comes to the leveling up aspect of said skills. The different villagers add to the fun as they all have their own specialties that really give the game life - especially when it takes place on an island that you're building up a town in. Now everyone's favorite breakdown

Pros:

- So much to do (Farming | Fishing | Cooking | Building | Hunting | Mining) and so much more!

- Freedom of choosing where Buildings | furniture | Roads| Decorations can go

- *cheating when I say this* But there literally is something for every type of person to do in the game. From the Farmer to the Miners or Fashion divas to the Hunters. Every avenue opens up blueprints to build more items or quests give outfits to those who desire them. 

- Lovely cartoon-style visuals throughout the game that make it 'soft' with a calming note to zone out to while you play

- A clear vision as to what the Developers want this game to be as they've gotten the point across in the first five seconds of the game and the latest update being the holiday one really pushes the point forward that this game is being worked on. 

- Reputation or Relationship bar that needs time and attention as to keep the player engaged into interacting with the animals/townsfolk

--
Cons:

- The sort of Animalese (or peopleese?) that the townsfolk speak can get a bit annoying but this is just a personal nitpick and In the sound options I'm actually sure it can be turned off or lowered.

- Certain movements or placements can have your character bug out in a demonic sense with their head turning around or going through the very in-game earth itself to meet the void. After 1-2 minutes of falling you'll be put back where your character was before the void fall.

- Animals can be buggy when moving around their pens or near their little huts as they can bully the other animals into corners or push them out of the gates you set up. (This only happened to me once and I couldn't get them to re-create the escape method)

- Being Early access I don't like putting this here but after a certain point in the game things tend to slow down and can become a grind-like scenario (Which a game in where you gather resources it isn't necessarily a bad thing)

- This ties into the 2nd and 3rd cons where a glitch happens to me where the save screen pulses red such as the event when you're exhausted /pass out the screen will do this red pulse around the edges. Though the issue here is when I'm tending to my village all day with my health and energy full then go to bed  it is as if I went 10 rounds with a Jackaroo.


Though with all this in mind please remember this is an Early Access game and thus far it is genuinely a must have game. I truly look forward to it, and hope that the devs keep adding to this game as it has become one of my new favorite obsession. Thank you Dinkum Dev for the hard work, your game is beautiful.

But like a bull, I saw those red flags and charged. This game has the potential to be a pretty cute, fun, and even relaxing game, but as it is, I've never wanted to smash my keyboard more. Without further ado, here are my thoughts on this game:

Graphics 7/10:
The graphics are cute for the most part, but rather mediocre. If you like staring at reddish-orange sand for most of your game time, (and your eyes aren't prone to hurting from prolonged exposure to those colors unlike mine) then this tidbit won't matter much to you. As for me, I keep too many sharp objects near my desk which I'm tempted to use to dislodge my eyes from their ocular cavities to want to play this game longer than I already have.

Music 7/10:
Cute, but mediocre. I almost forget there even is any music playing while I'm running around.

Controls 3/10:
Ever thought you'd have to ""line up your shot"" just to remove dirt and place it somewhere else? Look no further. I can't count the number of times I'd have to walk in circles just to get the damn cursor placement to fall on the block I was aiming for. You can also do a 180 in mid-air if you fancy that, which does come in handy for combat. The camera angles are actually pretty good, and walking is fine, but heaven help you when you want to build or decorate. This is especially true when you want to plant fruit trees (you have to dig up a square of dirt, throw 1 bit of fruit in the hole, then place the dirt back on top; yeah, fun).

Combat 2/10:
This game reminds me of Stardew Valley, except Stardew Valley allows the player to equip stylish shoes and rings that help you tank hits. But not Dinkum. As far as I can tell this game has you relying on boosts you get from eating meals you cook, which many of the ingredients aren't easy to obtain (at least to make cooking worth-while). I figure you can tank about 2 croc hits, but that third one is iffy. I found Halo attack-jumping quite useful for combat, but that method isn't fool-proof. Considering you do a fair bit of killing things that are trying to kill you, I would've thought the devs would've incorporated some sort of armor.

Crafting 3/10:
Grinding for materials is a staple feature with any crafting game, so you can expect that here. What I didn't expect, is for this game to make the material-gathering so tedious since you burn through your energy bar rapidly from using any of your tools to do anything. And that includes when you miss. If you're trying to catch a bug, make sure you're lined up correctly because both your energy and the tool's health bar will get depleted. I also didn't expect this game to make crafting in Staxel seem like a dream. Need 40 planks of wood? Guess what, you get to spend the very finite amount of time in this game's day/night cycle clicking that damn saw table 40 damn times. The same goes for cooking fruits, veggies, and meats in the BBQ or by way of the campfire. As far as I've gotten into the game, I don't see any sort of automation. You can speed up the process of certain tasks, but you're still going to be clicking each and every time.

Economy 1/10:
This game doesn't exactly have an economy in the sense that if you sell a bunch of one item, the demand lowers, and thus the amount of currency it's worth decreases. However, the townspeople require you to build them permanent shops which cost exorbitant amounts of Dinks (the currency). Each time you request a deed to build these stupid things, the mayor lady tells you how much money it will put the town in debt. The mayor lady also lets you know that everyone will help pay off the debt, which is true, but when a building puts you 250k in debt and the townsfolk donate tiny bits here or there, you're basically in charge of paying the bulk. It's easy enough to collect things to hock, and you can make a decent bit of cash selling all the items you find with the metal detector, but those items are also building materials so doing that often times works against you.

Overall 4/10:
Like I said, I wanted to like this game, but between the aforementioned qualms I have with this game, and my general patience for crafting games, I realized this game frustrates me beyond any desire I have for playing it further. I've been playing it a few hours each day for about a week, and I seem to be getting less and less happy playing this game. The only thing that does make me happy in this game is catching bugs. And also weakening the sharks enough that they swim from you in fear, which I then chase after them because I'm petty and vengeful. Did I mention swimming uses energy?

Building your town, interacting with NPC's to join your town, farming, mining, fishing etc. Its fun to see your little town grow. explore the map, take on sharks and crocs (once you can figure out how and have a good enough weapon to survive), learning and discovering food items and recipes. 

Something to note, while yes you'll be able to move buildings, it comes with a hefty price tag, so make sure you're certain on where you want your npc's setting up shop. 

In the not so great however, various glitches / bugs are inconvenient at best (camera lag, cooking on fire/bbq lag, unable to check mail) or extremely frustrating( game crashing, fish disappearing, friends going invisible when in co-op) My friend and i have worked out that when we notice the glitching/bugs showing up, to back out to the menu and restart the game, however - since i host most often, i have to restart the game entirely to refresh it. 
It seems the longer you spend in game, the more likely the bugs/glitches happen and the worse they get. 

The dev has done an AMAZING job with this game. It's very engaging and figuring out stuff has been fun. Early Access games aren't without their bugs and glitches, so with some patience it's undeniably enjoyable. I'm definitely looking forward to further patches and updates.

in its current state of the 'Bloomin' Springs"" update I definitely recommend this game for people who like a grind-y game.Its more akin to animal crossing in its progression but without the real time aspect which I greatly enjoy as I work a full time job Monday to Friday so this allows me to sink in a few hours each day and still make decent progress. Its a slow grind and yes the characters feel a bit cookie cutter which doesnt push me to interact with them like you normally would in other games but its still fun with a lot of things to collect. I havent encountered any bugs as of yet (absolute win)  but even then I still back things up just in case as its early access which I've noticed that some of the negative reviews dont seem to understand.
I would love more explanation on how to do certain things from the get go like plant a tree seed, yes there are small tips in the saving screen when you sleep but sometimes those arent noticed or come a bit too late to be considered useful. I would also love for the NPCs to have more in-depth personalities rather than stereotypical cookie cutters but so far its good.
Its nice to see an Australian spin on the more cozy town style game and I look forward to each and every update, just remember to back up your save every time you hop off or before updating just in case.",1681650391,1681650391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The from the gameplay trailers, the positive reviews, and the screenshots! I was sold. I paid full price, loaded it up. And was extremely disappointed with the experience I got. After like half an hour I was left unsatisfied with my experience. I haven't gotten past the part where you get Four residents to stay. I've got Two Buildings, the Store and the Museum, as well as the mine. To those curious as to where I am up to. 

When playing farming games, I like to have a storyline of some sort, or loads of quests from NPC's to keep myself occupied. This game barely has any of these things. Yes. The game kinda has its own form of this, by asking the NPC's if they need anything. But I have one gripe with this system. Why is there a day time limit on them? It‚Äôs just unnecessary and stresses me out. Isn't the point of these types of games to be cosy? Do you know how freakin stressful it is trying to find a microscopic fly, by the end of the day?! And no Fletch, I can't find you a Blue Spot Flathead! I mean if there wasn't a day time limit maybe I could?! Moving on.

Another gripe I have with this game is that the gameplay gets really stale, extremely quick. In other words, the grind isn‚Äôt fun! In this game Money is your best friend. But the way you get money is really tedious! Mostly by gathering, fishing or bug catching. You collect the same shells, same Butterflies, maybe the same fish but who knows! After I've bought the blueprints, placed them, gotten the materials, and the building is built. It sure does feel like a chore to pay off your debt! As soon as go to that donation box to see how much in debt the town is in, I think man I want to quit. Especially when I placed the mine and found out I have to buy a Pass EACH, I'll repeat that, [b]EACH[/b] time we want to go down. Why? Please explain why? Next point.

The NPC's. Never in a game have I met such dull, lifeless, and boring NPC's. For real! They just stand there all day every day, just in the same spot. Even when you speak to them it feels boring, they feel like Robots. Each time I interact with them, it feels like I'm opening the settings app on my PC. They feel like they were just created to be store clerks. Can they walk around the town? Do stuff in their free time? Have quests for us to complete that help us progress? Or give us something interesting to do? Nope. There is no personality, interests, hobbies, other than their job. They're just nice. They smile, they laugh, the wonder, they work, and THATS IT! Please can the NPCs be updated? Next point.

The attack system isn‚Äôt very good. Its very easy to be hurt and eventually killed by animals at least in my experience. I spear a Croc, and after three bites from it I‚Äôm dead! And I‚Äôve lost crap! This gave me multiple headaches and migraines, I just gave up on it and decided not to try and attack things anymore lol. Now closing.

In conclusion the game is pretty bad. There was a clear effort, but it all falls flat. The gameplay is extremely repetitive, and boring. Honestly don't care even if this game is still in early access. Telling my friends not to buy this anymore, especially since I‚Äôve heard that the multiplayer is mostly just visiting the Town instead of actually participating. I‚Äôm sure some people will say that it gets better after building most of the town, I actually kept playing thinking the same thing. But should I be forced to suffer though all that to get to some eventual enjoyment? Maybe if it was more of like an hour of boredom I would consider still playing, but I don't understand why this game has all this praise. I wish I could my money and time back. Maybe I'll come back to it sometimes but its really mediocre. The End.",1681550653,1681600613,False,13,5,0.544275820255279541,0,True,False,True

[b]Visuals: 3/5[/b] 
[list]
[*] The colour pallet is very true to the region/aesthetic. Each biome is distinct and pleasant to look at.
[*] Models are clear and detailed. What you see in the screenshots is what you get.
[*] Lighting works [i]really[/i] well, imo.
[*] It won‚Äôt blow you mind. Everything is very functional rather than attempting to impress you.
[/list]

[b]Sound: 3/5[/b]
[list]
[*] A nice ambience. The soundtrack is great to chill for, but you will substitute it for your own.
[*] Sounds are clear and easy to recognise. I never noticed any clutter, even with several things going on around me.
[*] As with the visuals, everything is functional rather than attempting to impress you. 
[/list]

[b]Gameplay: 5/5[/b]
[list]
[*] Bug catching, Decorating (fashion, furniture, town), Fishing, Foraging, Hunting, Mining ‚Äì there‚Äôs plenty to do and each option has plenty of variety built into it.
[*] A giant sandbox. You do what you want as you want to do it. There is progression which will help direct you, but even that gives you complete agency.
[*] Townsfolk have distinct personalities. While they‚Äôre not deep, I still enjoyed interacting with them. In most games like this, building relations with townsfolk becomes a chore. In Dinkum, I still read every line of dialogue and find myself smiling or chuckling.
[*] More content as time goes on. I hope the developer loved making this game because it feels like a lot of care, detail and effort has gone into it.
[*] I encountered a single alt+tab softlock in an earlier version. That‚Äôs the only bug I‚Äôve encountered. A [b]very[/b] stable game.
[/list]

[b]Control: 3/5[/b]
[list]
[*] Handles exactly as you‚Äôd expect from a sim like this.
[*] Precision placement can be a touch clunky, but any mistakes are very easy to undo.
[*] Combat is a touch finicky, but easy to adapt to.
[*] Played using a keyboard + mouse. 
[/list]
 
[b]Summary: 4/5[/b]
[list]
[*] A very stable and enjoyable experience. I‚Äôve put 93 hours into it over two major periods of play. I can see myself putting in more as more content is added.
[*] Incredibly easy to pick up and put down. There‚Äôs no need to ever feel burnout.

[list]
[*]You can quickly unlock the basic features and get to gathering/building. 
[*]You can have multiple saves! 
[*]There are enemies; none that are very hard and it's not gory so I don't think those with kiddos will be upset by this addition. 
[*]There is a lot to collect and do right from the start. 
[*]You can obtain vehicles.
[*]There are mines.
[*]Villagers have daily quests.
[*]The game is not tied to real time so things progress much faster.
[/list]

Multiplayer is decent. I haven't experienced any connection issues. When I'm visiting my nephew's game the town acts like I'm a resident. I haven't encountered anything I can do as a visitor. The one annoyance was that the store still only sold one of each tool per day even with two people playing. It's not the kind of set up where you would want to let strangers visit your game though due to all the freedoms.

[b]Glitches I've encountered so far:[/b]
[list]
[*]Your island can generate in a way that the docking area is blocked by a tower so you can't actually play. You have to restart.
[*]Your mailbox might glitch and no longer let you open letters. You can sometimes see a tool icon such as a pick ax as your pointer in the mailbox screen. Existing and reloading your save fixes this.
[*]There are times when the 'Sell' button becomes unresponsive when selling items to John. Closing out of the conversation and trying to sell again works. 
[/list]

[b]Recommendations:[/b] 
[list]
[*]A way to pause in multiplayer. Real life is always happening. Perhaps in multiplayer if all the players enter their journals or inventory that could be a trigger to pause time.
[*]Lower the cost of mine passes, at least for the first year. 
[*]More villagers. I find I do miss the quantity in Stardew and the ability to pick and chose who inhabits your island from Animal Crossing. I wouldn't mind some kid/teens that moved in with their family. Perhaps a teen could work part time at John's or some other store and thus the place would/could be open in the evening hours or on a formerly 'closed' day. If colds, wounds, infections, or poison was thing in the game then a doctor/pharmacist. Maybe a librarian, you could find books and donate them to the library which could increase villager happiness. You could also increase your skills slightly by choosing to read for a bit. Maybe some trees or plants could get sick and thus a botanist would be needed in order to treat your crops or keep trees from dying off. A mechanic for when your vehicles break down. 
[*]Build a family for your character. My Harvest Moon/Story of Season/Rune Factory days make me wish this game let you pick a spouse and have and/or adopt kids.
[*]Second mine/cave.  I would love a second area to explore; preferably with a different feel/design.

Not quite Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing, Not quite Mine Craft. Is it the best of both games? No but there is fun to be had if you have the time. And honestly, the cost is less than a new switch.

Just try it, you know you want to spend some time in an Australian outback version of mincraft/animalcrossing right!

It is a bit slow to get going, and the mechanics are very poorly tutorialized, so the game really does expect you to have a certain degree of familiarity with the genre mechanics of other games previously mentioned. This is a poor ""baby's first farming/crafting sim"" as it currently stands, and hopefully the dev does a better job of adding in those elements during Early Access.

But that's not much of a knock against it overall. Dinkum sets out to be a fun, quirky, cute time-burner and it succeeds in its task admirably. That plus the $20 price tag is enough to recommend it.

I'm trying to build with the terrain but I've seen some incredible builds on YouTube where people have filled in rivers to create more land, so the limit is really your own imagination in this game.

I love how I can play differently depending on what I have time for or how I feel. If I need a relaxing experience, I'll go fish on the beach and listen to the waves. If I need to zone out a little bit and think about something else, I'll move dirt with my shovel and wheelbarrow while my mind drifts elsewhere. If I'm feeling like taking a risk and gaining a great reward, I'll buy a mine pass and try to find locked treasure rooms and evade crocs in the deep mine.

I love building relationships with the villagers and it's always nice to receive gifts from them, too. Just the other day I got a letter from Irwin with no gift, only a lovely note that said something like ""I just wanted to say it's great what you've done for our town.""

It'd be cool to see a similar feature as Animal Crossing, where we could send villagers mail. I was 11 when I played the first Animal Crossing game and it was really exciting to send mail and receive replies.

Farming was, at first, seemingly unnecessary until I realized I could expand my stamina and health bars with certain foods. I'm looking forward to any expansion of the farming system. I don't have a tractor yet (I don't have ANY expensive tools, really), so I only farm a small plot for now. I've heard it becomes especially lucrative when you're planting and harvesting huge lots with a tractor.

The only negative feedback I'll give is that fishing became harder with the spring update. I didn't have a 100% success rate or anything before, but it wasn't too hard to wrangle any fish, big or small. Now the updated system requires I look at the sidebar for the green GO!, instead of at the fish I'm trying to catch. I greatly preferred the original fishing system and I've definitely caught a lot less fish since the system was updated. Fishing previously brought me calm, but now it's a bit too busy to be relaxing.

It contains far less life sim than Animal Crossing - and no romance, unlike SoS/HM - but mirrors New Horizons' terraforming and definitely borrows heavily from the AC aesthetic and vibes. It feels satisfying to make a beautiful town. Because it is Early Access, it is still unfinished, but the updates are meaty and it's exciting to see how your established town can be changed and expanded in order to accommodate new items and buildings with updates.

I have not played Minecraft but the control you have over the terrain is pretty robust and seems similar. It's measured in blocks and the land appears blocky (though the animals and characters and buildings do not), and you can do things like turn what is currently sand into mud or dirt or vice versa, expand shorelines far into the ocean to create more landmass, and other similar massive renovations for your desired town look.

It also has an RPG-style tool upgrade system where you gain levels in skills to unlock crafting recipes or the ability to purchase higher level permits for those skills. So you mine a bunch in order to unlock better mining picks to mine more stuff - standard for farm sims, imo, and done well.

Lone downside: heavy on crafting. If you don't like games with a TON of makers, you will dislike that aspect of Dinkum. It's one of my least favorite parts of farm sims that seems to have crept into the genre, but it's not enough to ruin this game for me, unlike other similar maker-centric games (such as Pioneers of Olive Town which was destroyed, for me, by its over-reliance on Makers while having a farm you couldn't customize very well around their use).",1680545697,1680545697,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game had objects disappearing and dropping by themselves, and my avatar got stuck in a dialog, preventing me from moving or leaving. I was forced to lose an entire day's progress in the game by using the Alt + F4 command to exit the game due to these annoying bugs. Despite these issues, the game is enjoyable, especially considering it is in early access. The game has a pleasant soundtrack, and building the village is entertaining, while the quest system is captivating, providing ample entertainment. I recommend the game currently, with the expectation that new updates will address these bugs and bring improvements. However, if the game is released without resolving these issues, I will update my review to ""not recommended"".

During gameplay, my husband and I identified certain areas for improvement in the final game. For example, in Coop mode, the island should be divided between the host and players, with players becoming residents instead of mere visitors. 

Currently, multiplayer mode only allows all players on the island to enter the mine together and not alone by themselves. 

There is also a lack of a diverse range of animals and biomes, which makes the game less engaging. It took me a long time to buy the game since the few existing biomes are not vast and are quite similar, with unappealing color palettes. More biomes such as a snow biome, along with more types of flowers and plants, would be beneficial. Furthermore, the game needs more hair options for character creation, and the design of the face could also be improved.

Crafting items in the game is tedious and slow since it can only be done one unit at a time or in small packs, which consumes a whole day's progress. The same goes for refining wood and melting ores, which is also time-consuming. 

Changing buildings is inconvenient since I need to remove it from one place and put it in another before moving it to its final location, leading to additional charges for moving buildings more than once a day. Moreover, it is not feasible to change more than one building per day. 

I would also like to see a wardrobe added to the game with a changing room so that players don't have to store clothes in chests, and it's easier to see your avatar wearing them.

In addition, sign plates to put in chests would make it easier to organize and identify what is inside each chest. 

It would also be helpful to add a lawnmower to the game to remove the entire grass, and not just the weeds, as it would be easier to change the grass in some places. 

A new gate that NPC's cannot open would also be beneficial since they tend to open the gate of my animal's farm. 

Lastly, we encountered a bug where John is standing in front of the store on Monday at 9 am and does not want to go in, even though the store is supposed to open at 8 am every day except Sunday.

UPDATE: They added icons on clothes and furniture, which is a welcomed improvement.",1675552780,1680477293,True,178,6,0.870309770107269287,15,True,False,True

Dinkum is an absolute corker of a survival sandbox game that brings the wonder and charm of the Australian outback to life, while giving a nod to the cozy vibes of Animal Crossing and the wholesome farming mechanics of Stardew Valley. Set in a procedurally generated land down under, Dinkum lets you explore, build, and craft. The game is chock-a-block with opportunities to create your own unique adventure, whether you're mining for precious resources, farming, or becoming a legendary wombat whisperer.

The game's vibrant art style and colorful environments will immediately catch your eye, while the cheeky humor and Aussie lingo create an authentic and immersive atmosphere. Dinkum's creatures, both real and mythical, will keep you on your toes as you traverse the bush, and the challenge of building up your settlement from scratch is as satisfying as a cold stubby on a hot day.

Now, don't get me wrong, Dinkum is a good a game, but after about 10 hours, the depth of gameplay and gameplay loop can start to wear a bit thin. While there's still plenty to see and do, the initial excitement might give way to a bit of a slog. But fear not, cobber, because the multiplayer aspect is where the game really shines. Nothing beats rounding up your mates and embarking on a grand adventure to tame the Outback together. The cooperative elements encourage teamwork and bring out the best of the game's mechanics.

In conclusion, Dinkum blends the charm of Animal Crossing and the farming fun of Stardew Valley while adding its own Aussie flair. Grab your mates, fire up the barbie, and savor a Vegemite sandwich as you embark on a ripper of an adventure!",1680379158,1680387396,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You get llittle use out of your tools before they break. Money is hard to come by, you are supposed to run around the island all day, pick up and sell things, which is a huge time-sink for no reason.

I tried out fishing, but it is atrocious. The fish rarely(!) bite and when they do you have a fraction of a second to start reeling them in. The way it's made, the system wants you to spend the whole day for little reward and a lot of frustration!

I also didn't like the fact that random NPCs come and go. I managed to get John the trader to stay. I also got a guy that made me build a museum. However, the farming person never showed up and the furniture guy left after one day unexpectedly.

I'm approximately 8 hours in. I should be trawling the island for tin, but I can't get myself to log in anymore. One would hope for some progress for this amount of time spent and for more exciting gameplay features to open up, but nothing on the horizon. Everything costs a lot of resources, so all I see in more of the same grind.

Very serious thumbs-down! If I lived for 500 years, I would probably not have a problem investing this kind of time. But in this day and age, who has hundreds of hours to devote to Dinkum?",1680383757,1680383757,False,2,0,0.419014096260070801,0,True,False,True

I'll start with what I really liked. The entire feel of the game feels like animal crossing, but better. There are fewer characters, but they all seem to have their own personalities so far and you can develop friendships with them. The fishing in this game is one of the better fishing ""mini games"" in any game I've played, its not hard, but it doesn't feel too easy either, once you get a feel for it. I don't like the added guide after the latest update.
The exploration feels nice, (though I do wish the different ""areas"" had a minimum size, some of my plains are only 10x10 blocks big so when looking for certain bugs, this can be a bit annoying, but not a big deal at all, just strange). 
It is very aesthetically pleasing. 
The music and general sound effects are amazing, especially after the update. There are even different sound effects for minor things, amazing attention to detail.
There aren't very many hair options, but there are enough. I loved to see that there is a variety of curly/kinky hair textures and though I'm not black, this was something nice to see included so that people can have characters that look like themselves. 
Dinkum feels like all the best parts of so many games I love.

I wish that pressing the escape button would pause the game in single player. I understand that maybe they want time to move forwards while you're looking in your bags so that you need to keep your weapon handy, or even other menus, but I could see someone thinking they're pausing the game when they aren't in reality. 
Some of the menus are awkward to navigate, especially speech menus. Sometimes pressing escape when talking with someone selects yes, sometimes it selects no. It should always select no or at least be consistent, it seems to be based on where your cursor is on the screen.
In multiplayer, there are many bugs, but that's to be expected. The secondary player can pay to adopt animals, but the animal never shows up. Most things that are different for the secondary character makes sense, but I do wish that they could at least upgrade their own house as only the main house can be upgraded in size.",1672796223,1680377933,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The creator of Dinkum has done something truly amazing when he developed this game and I admire him for that. However, the newest update has left a sour taste in my mouth. To be fair this has been coming on for a while and it all started with the fact that you can only save via sleeping. Therefor if your halfway into a day and something else happens in your life that you need to addend to, you have to sleep in game to save your for the progress, otherwise it will be lost. Here's the thing...after the new update, my game has been crashing quite a bit, I dealt with it via Gamer rage and moved on. But today I just threw my toys out of the cot when I saw that 4 hours of playtime (that's a lot for me in one sitting) has just been wiped due to a crash. The game loaded into the day that I should be in, but none of the tasks that I completed in the past four hours has saved, NOTHING. I can't explain to you the devastation when I walked into my town and saw nothing that I did was there anymore. Nor are the stuff I collected and/or built. 
Some other common complaints after the update include:
Fishing rods breaking - I no longer fish in game, it's just not enjoyable anymore.
Game crashing - I clearly am experiencing it.
NPC are ""Buggy"" - I have not experienced this yet.
Can't weight certain items at John - I have experienced this as well with rubies.
And then one more that I can't mention without a spoiler alert so I'll leave that one.

You also now need to have a license for absolutely everything. You actually need to have a license to write a sign. The other licenses I understand, like vehicles and such but to make a sign??Or to make cheese?? I don't agree with that, but I can see the appeal of why it was brought in, I just don't like it, so take that comment as you please. But to me personally, it feels as though the game is forcing you to focus on one area (Gathering points to buy a license, and then you kind of forget about the beautiful game that your playing. But again, this is a personal feeling so if you don't agree, don't mind me. 

In a whole, it's a beautiful game and I really do love it. There's a lot that you can do and experience and you can see that the Dev really does love and care for this game. But I can't deny that the things I listed above are pushing me to find a new game to play.

Nevertheless, I would still recommend it because new players will see these thing as a sort of normal since they don't know what the game use to be so it won't bother them as much as it would someone who's been playing for a while. So, enjoy the game for me and I hope that the Dev will consider his long time players as much as he does the new one's when making updates and please, PLEASE add a ""Save"" option without sleep.

As we take on each challenge, and constantly strive.

The game of Dinkum, is not for the faint,
But with teamwork and strategy, we make no complaint.
We laugh and we cheer, as we make it through,

The map size is a little small for my flavor, I am used to playing on maps that are several hundred sq kilometres. So the map feels small to me and with all the transportation you end up with it gets smaller, fast.

It's a super fun game, and the first game I really took time to review because I'm enjoying it so much and it deserves the love. There was a major update days ago and it's even better now, with more things to do. It's very layered and detailed and even at 60+ hours there's lots I haven't unlocked. It's very Animal-Crossing style, maybe with a hint of Minecraft (with the world/building landscaping and mobs) and Stardew (mines, seasonal harvesting) but it is a unique thing that isn't any of these things. I really enjoy the battle/combat system (there are animals you can hunt, hope this element gets expanded) and the mining system, which just got an update/another level. Considering it's Early Access, the game is super polished and looks amazing and runs great, it's very well thought out-- I was very impressed with all the animations and the way that things feel-- for example, rowing the boat, driving the motorcycle, diving and fishing are very satisfying and have really good game-feel. World progression is fun, and I'm extremely excited to see the future of this game and what other visitors the dev is planning. We already got one more in the latest update, which is great! The updates so far have been fantastic. I hesitated at first because I wasn't sure what it would be like but it was worth every penny and then some, I highly recommend it. 

It has a bit of a learning curve at the start, which is the only drawback-- things are hard, but once you get the hang of the world and your skills progress then it becomes second nature and things become easier. Also, some of the things are a bit confusing-- for example, took me a while to figure out how the fishing first worked or how to move dirt with the wheelbarrow. And a couple of things aren't intuitive -- for example, if you shear a tin bar you get tin sheets which I discovered way late into the game. And If you find things when metal detecting that you can pick up over your head (like fossils or amber) you can weigh them in the store on the scale and sell them that way. I might have missed the game telling me about those, but at first I wasn't sure what those items were. But there are very informative wikis that dedicated people have put out that help a lot. 

If I had one gripe, it's that multiplayer needs a bit of a tweak-- it works pretty well but can be a bit laggy  -- especially when I connect to my international friends. It's probably my bad AU internet though, more than anything. Probably connecting in the same house/country is better.  Also it's kinda like AC in that one person hosts the game and the other 'visits' so while they can do almost everything, they can't progress certain parts of the settlement and are barred from certain things (like placing buildings etc), so you never really 'share' the world 100%. Personally, it works fine for us, but some people might not like that, preferring a server style world like MC. Despite this, multiplayer works well-- I have a world I only play with my SO and a world for my own personal play and I'm loving it-- as the worlds are randomised, it's always feels different to play each world. 

One suggestion I would love to see in future, is biome percentages on world creation, and the option of specifying which biome to start in. Default would work as it does now, a completely area in a random world-- but it would be great if you could increase biome percentages depending on if you wanted a swamp-heavy world or desert-y world etc. I really wanted a beachy or islandy world to contrast with my other game, and I had to restart my world a few times to get the stretch of coastline I wanted. If I could have upped the percentage of beach by 10-20% on the random world generation, that would have been awesome. You DO need the other biomes for crafting nodes and resources, so I don't wanna get rid  of them, but as long as you have a minimum percentage of those biomes in the game, it should work fine. I would love to see that in future.

The other thing is that I would love for the seasons to feel a bit more unique (especially winter) and more types of weather, but I believe the dev is working on this. The Bloomin Spring update is great step towards that direction so far, and I'm extremely excited for the future of this game. I actually prefer it to Stardew, because the rwg seed/minecraft aspect and AC concept of making your own settlement (plus 3d decorating) is more up my alley. Anyway, super cute and super worth it! If you like AC or Stardew, absolutely give it a try!",1679913220,1679913568,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I put 85 hours into it and that's a decent amount of hours for a game at this price. However, compared to other games that ""scratch that itch"", this game has a huge void where more content should be.

I have never played Animal Crossing, so I don't know how this game compares, but a lot of folks compare this game to Stardew Valley. I put 600 hours into Stardew Valley and never really made it through the Island quests, which is to say I freaking love Stardew and that game has a huge amount of content. Not to mention, Stardew is less expensive than Dinkum.

Please, stop comparing this to Stardew. It just does not match up. You can't make wine or beer, you can't marry anyone, you can't make the equivalent of a ""slime hutch"", there's no Wizard, there are very few recipes, and the list goes on. This game takes a very shallow dip into many of the pools of gameplay that really good games like Stardew have. But, it's just a shallow facsimile, not a true sandbox game.

This game will not cure your itch for ""something like Stardew Valley but new"". Only a new Stardew map, or a mod will do that. Then again, I didn't quite make it all the way to the very best tools I could have crafted, so I would say this game has a good 100 hours of gameplay or so if you want to do everything except the super grindy achievements.

The new update adds a few drops to each of the various gameplay pools, like some new flowers. I might have reinstalled and tried this game again if they had added any new crops to grow, or some way to make growing crops more interesting but alas that didn't happen. Growing crops and utilizing them for money, food, or anything in this game just sucks beans compared to Stardew.

One last little rant, I really wanted to like building in this game but it's just not a great experience. I wanted to build a lookout tower, so I manually shoveled piles of dirt into a wheelbarrow and slowly built upward. Interacting with tools and terrain in this game can be a nightmare, but I really wanted to get a bird's eye view of my little town, and the crop field I had planned out. The height limit for building is pretty short it turns out. So, you just can't build a tower. It's about 10 tiles up. Yeah, it's a sandbox, just not a very big one. Still, to its credit it's better than Green Hell or Ark for me in terms of fun per dollar spent, which is saying something. Get it on sale, with very low expectations.

I have no idea why Steam hasn't implemented a ""maybe"" button yet, but I would give this game a ""maybe"" recommendation, leaning towards ""just play Stardew while listening to an Australian podcast or youtuber"".",1679900826,1679900826,False,5,0,0.498696655035018921,0,True,False,True

Yes, there are a few bugs you'll run into with it being early access, but the game is actually quite polished and at a good stage to jump in.

I have a RTX 4090 with a high end gaming system full optimized for gaming.   I have zero issues with other high end AAA games with MAX settings.  However, with Dinkum I cannot even run this game with high graphics without stuttering.   The stuttering only happens inside my town and probably because I have a big town with a lot of stuff in it.  However, when I'm only getting 50-60 FPS with medium graphics and 5 view chunk and high FPS setting this is very disappointing.

Sometimes, its very straight forward, and sometimes you run around for a day or two wondering if you're going to prompt something new to happen. If I had to choose one complaint about in game play, its having to buy new tools in the beginning until you build the machine to repair them. Unlike AC, You do kind of have to plan more things or you'll get stuck without something in the first couple of days. I love the traditional day/night cycle.

I think this is also created by a single person, the developer, James, as I watched a live stream with him and he's continually adding things and tweaking the game to make it even better.

This would be one of the BEST UPDATES EVER FOR THIS GAME and probably make it the best game ever created. 

Animal crossing had a thing where we could download people's designs. This would be better then that! To download an entire landmark vlueprint made by others and place it on our island. 

Also maybe it introduces a new character to this game? Who deals with these landmark blueprints?

Another amazing thing is if we could travel to amyones location who makes it available for us. 

Maybe there's a billvord post that we can get that shows around the world locations for us to visit.? Or maybe we aquire a airballon or a place to fly around the world üåé

They all more or less look the same when you are looking through the pictures and videos on the steam store pages, their only distinguishing features being the one or two gimmicks that make them unique. When I first saw Dinkum, I completely wrote it off as some lazy cash grab coming into to snipe the same audience as Stardew Valley and its many clones. 

That said during the Steam Winter sale of '22, Dinkum was going for a good price and it looked interesting enough to pick up. To be completely honest, I am super happy that I did. Dinkum is 100% greater than the sum of its parts and is a testament to what indie games can do with a little community support and some good ideas. Dinkum pays homage to the Outback better than any other title I have come across, doing a stellar job of invoking the desolation of rural Australia without ever making the player feel lonely or dejected. Mechanically, Dinkum is innovative and interesting to play with. The way that soil can be moved and manipulated and the various systems in place around this mechanic is quite impressive for a game that could otherwise be written off as just another farming game. The way that Dinkum includes bug catching, mining, farming, hunting, dungeon crawling, fishing, and vehicular gameplay without making any of the individual gameplay components feel too weak or unpolished in comparison to the others is a serious mark of success for an indie title. No one gameplay method is more overpowered than the rest, allowing players to enjoy Dinkum regardless of their gamestyle of choice. The game looks good, sounds good, and has mostly good performance with minimal bugs or crashing. Of note, there is a serious performance issue with the underground mines, but not any gamebreaking issues to be concerned about. The characters control well and the gameplay is intuitive without feeling like a copy of other titles. Dinkum is the complete survival package, pulling the best mechanics of its contemporaries into one solid title. I would happily recommend the title to anyone with a passing enjoyment of Stardew-like titles and I look forward to seeing what else is added to the otherwise already incredily fleshed out title as it moves towards release.",1679421222,1679421222,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

[b]Overall[/b]
- If you are looking for Stardew Valley experience, this game isn't for you. It may look very much like SV, but the gameplay is more of sandbox or city building, rather than farming sims. 
- Despite being early access, the game is pretty much playable. However, there needs to be a significant amount of updates, quality of life improvements as well as balancing in order to make this game more enjoyable. 

[b]Good[/b]
- Graphic and animations are simple but yet fantastic. Main attraction of this game. 
- Background music and sound effects are decent. It gets repetitive after a while but not to the extend of annoying.
- There are a few glitches and fps drops but nothing game breaking so far.

[b]Bad[/b]
- The game is incredibly grindy AND repetitive, which makes everything a chore. There is limited numbers of automation at this stage. Hence, everything gets even worse as you progress/expand further. 
- Everything is randomized. Literally everything. From the world map, to the mines, to NPC quests and even to the crafting recipes. This takes the meaning out of exploration because no matter how far I venture away from my base, everything is the same as what I have in the vicinity. 
- NPC quests are garbage. The objectives and rewards are generic regardless who is the quest giver. Worst thing is that, crafting recipes, which are considered as key items for this game since it heavily revolves around decorating, are locked behind these freaking lame quests. But that's not all. you would have no prior knowledge of what reward you will receive until you have completed the quests, which I think it's complete bullsheet. 90% of the time, you get a pathetic amount of coins and 10% of it you will receiving a RANDOM crafting recipe. It took me an eternity just to unlock two wooden streetlamps, that are not aesthetically compatible with my base design.
- Speaking of crafting recipes, Frankly sells one every day (except Sat/Sun)... but... it's random, AND inclusive recipes that you've already learned. Seriously how hard is it for the developer to make him sell only new recipe, or create a vendor to allow me to straight up buy what I need? This is just stupid design at it's finest. 
- The deep mine is one of the most painful experience I had, as if it the developer is a sadist or masochist or some sort. Not a surprise if it's true, since anyone sane would not name the game [b]Din'tCum[/b]. Basically everything in the mine is once again, random. You can go 100km into the mine but still see the same crap you see in the first 100m. And there's like only 3 types of enemies in the mine which you can cheese easily by spamming jump hit.
- The game also has some serious balancing issues. Bugs, shells, fish, fruits and even crops are worthless, as compared to hunting down all the Mu and Crocs every day. Why bother with watering worthless crops or wasting your time with bugs and fishes, when you can get like 100-200K easily every day just by capturing stupid animals? Yes, it's tedious and not enjoyable, but it's the most efficient way to progress.
- Most of the stuffs are heavily overpriced, or incredibly inconvenient just to stall player and artificially lengthen the game. Take example if I wish to move a building, I gotta pay 25K AND wait a day. Oh? And this action is limited to only once per day. For fk sake this is a decorating game. How the hell am I suppose to experiment with my design and have fun at the same time, if there's so many unnecessary restrictions? 
- Licence system is a creative idea, but it's poorly executed. Irrigation licence, why does this exist? Shouldn't it be part of farming? It's like going to Mc Donalds and order a BigMac just to realize that patty is not included, sold separately. 
- There is no final goal or ways to beat the game. Once you reached financial freedom, which is less than a year in game for me, your purpose is to keep decorating and nothing else. Since most of the crafting recipes are locked behind randomly generated generic quests which I don't care enough to do, I have basically hit a wall. There is no motivation or purpose for me to continue playing the game unless I wish to suffer. 
- Multiplayer - I have not tried it, but thankfully I read the wiki first before persuading my friend to jump into this game. There's a huge tons of limitations from what I understood, which probably will not make the multiplayer experience fun.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
- The concept of this game is cool (although not original), but it would need at least a few years and significant amount of updates to meet my standards. 
- There needs to be a mod or a DLC to significant reduce the randomness in order to promote exploration, while making each NPCs unique and interesting. But I doubt that will happen.
- Considered how cheap this game is priced, if you like life sims, sandbox, or decorating games, give it a try. Just don't put your hopes and expectations too high up.

For all the fun I had in this game so far, there is one glaring issue that nets this a personal thumbs down for me; the pets, or lack thereof. 

Remember how in Animal Crossing if you wanted a pet beetle, or butterfly or whatever, you just plop it down in your house and it gets a display automatically? Yeah, not the case here. 

I was also straight up LIED to about taming any of the other big wildlife, if there is a way, I haven't found it.

Major problem with the game is the Stamina management. There are no sure ways other than eating quality food to get stamina increase and recovery. 

This is especially painful early to mid game and somewhat persists throughout the whole experience. I had some days where all I did is either fish, farm or hunt just to stock up on food in order to do some creative stuff like : city planning, landscaping, forestry, crafting and plethora of other fun activities. 

Your character will level up certain skills which then consume less stamina in the process but some tasks like ""shovelling the ground"" DO NOT INCREASE the skills! I spent in game WEEKS to flatten the ground or make hills with NO PROGRESS and MONEY made. Just to have a nice flat surface to place buildings on. 

Yet, all that ground work consumes tons of stamina on top of breaking the tools. Even with electric tools that are unlocked later on the job is still painfully cumbersome. 

In my humble opinion there should be a skill that levels up the stamina ( with a limit, let's say 100 % more stamina than starting one ), some landscaping tasks should also count towards progression and decrease stamina usage. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Town Debt can be a pain but once the player starts farming with a traktor or unlock the mines ( mid- to late game ) player will be swimming in money. 

Exploration is rather bland and uneventful ( although I recommend choosing STARTING location wisely and have a plan in mind otherwise it will be costly and time consuming to move all the buildings to a new area ). 

Combat is... well it works. There is no active skills, armours, throwables, dodges etc. It's as basic as it can get. Left click to attack and WASD to move around. Considering enemies in the mines can be rather annoying and the rooms claustrophobic this kind of combat just begs for an improvement. 

NPC's are dull and they have very limited dialogue database. I had encountered some ""TEXT GOES HERE"" boxes on 4-5 star relationship hearts and I have never seen A.I doing some actual work. Like repairing stuff, farming or even fishing. Stuff that makes them a bit more believable. In the future I hope they will use vehicles, boats and interact with each other or the animals more... that however all depends on the Developer. 

Graphics are charming but personally hate some of the designs... such as kangaroos with antlers? dogs that look like an ordinary dingo or a mutt you see everywhere, NPC's are as charming as a potato and other than that I would like to see MOUNTAINS, WATERFALLS, BRIDGES FOR VEHICLES just to bring much needed variety! Most biomes are on repeat and once you have seen one there is no point in going to another... 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The game can be fun and relaxing. Seeing the biome slowly transform into a bustling town with plenty of crops gives a nice cosy, feeling of achievement. 
Grind is painful and constant stamina management makes it even worse. Unlocking recipes is random and some activities are not explained properly ( such as capturing animals etc. ). 

I would like to recommend the game but only if you have LOTS and i mean LOADS OF SPARE TIME. 

I've put around 40 hours in and I'm nowhere near the completion. Remember, take it slow as some days will be spent on catching up / stocking up, in order to have fun the day after.",1670448497,1678468305,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I share sentiments with other reviews on several aspects. It's not the worst game I've played, but it has performance issues (that showed up when I tried to scale down the settings to gain performance), you'll need to wiki for insight on some matters because they just are not explained outright until a point that becomes sour (there are books on some things you can buy, but you need to get to the point you've built John's Shop). There-in, it could be said it suffers some pacing and conveyance of information issues.

Blueprints are gate-kept behind the permits, or research, or experience level, or you have to do favors for the NPCs and hope they decide to reward your help with clothings, furniture, or blueprint. Some items did not show up in catalog. Items are supposed to show up in catalog when you obtain them so you can ditch them to save inventory space and dinks towards paying off the debts. Debts slowly get contributions from the NPCS over time, but the debts are often large so if you don't know the fast money methods you would be grinding in an environment with very little in the way of mobs, plants, etc compared to many sandbox/building/crafting games.


I unlocked the deep mine to find that it costs 25K dinks for a one-time pass to access them, I have to buy iot every time I want to attempt to explore the deep mines. The town debt on adding the deep mines is 250K. Couldn't make progress in the mine because of bats and mushroom gator. Was expecting to not need to destroy all the surface rocks to get desperately needed copper and iron (have plenty of tin) so I could keep the natural appearances of the world. Not sure if I should have waited to do this deed, because frankly I'm not seeing the ROI in access to the ores I need to snowball the other projects I need to get done -building certain blueprint items and structures that will open up better revenue streams to accelerate the town growth.

But everything feels sand bagged despite having upgraded my house, have John's shop, the Museum, the Greenhouse, and the Deep Mine all built. I'm not feeling like I gained traction. NPCs have dialog, but it starts to really repeat after not too long. If you are asked to fetch a thing, you better have it on you already, because if you can't find it by the end of the in-game day then the character's bond to you takes a small hit.

This is a very ambitious project and frankly I feel like the sluggish build up to get the resources I need to build as I'd like is going to have me so dulled by the limited landscape and dull interactions that I'm going to drop this because I'm going to feel too much of my time is being taken for minimal reward in progression and ability to do what I desire to do: design the landscape and a town.

Technically, aside from performance hits that make no sense popping up sporadically, causing stuttering, I had issues where in trying to deselect items to sell to John the game simply refused to move the selection (playing on controller). I had to grab my mouse and keyboard to remedy the issue. Also, trying to toss caged animals to a drop zone sometimes is an issue as the cage lands on the walls of the drop spot, so some animals would break out and get stuck, and it'd take a few tries to get the cage in the drop zone -having to re-capture the animal each time the cage got stuck as you can't just pick it up again off the side wall it gets stuck on.


I'd love to have enjoyed this to the degree others seem to suggest they are at this point -but I'm not. It feels too early in development. I also feel like I'm likely going to need to restart each update to gauge how updates affected elements -which further derails from the building I want to do. There are going to be people who love the slow build up. Frankly I find it strange that I've upgraded my house and have 3 shops, and yet I don't have an actual bed and I'm not being bugged to build homes for the residents prior to building their shops. They all legit stand around at night in whatever weather and have no place to sleep. Nobody even raises a single complaint about it. I desperately need copper and iron, but time doing that detracts from time paying off debts for adding buildings. I don't think there is enough on the surface to not have me drastically changing everything. I am unaware if rocks randomly reform on the surface over time or not, which makes me hesitant to just break them all down.

As the dev points out in the explanation of the EA status, there is a generally playable game here. Thing is, what needs to be tweaked to make it all mesh just right and how long until that is implemented? I can't get a refund at this point.The gamet has charm, and potential. But I'm going to have to check back in months, maybe two years later to see if progress was ever made to a point that actually addresses deep dynamic synergies and immersion coherence in ways that make the experience better.",1678365748,1678365748,False,5,0,0.494498938322067261,0,True,False,True

My problem is that unlike a lot of other games of the similar genre the story and other people feel lacking and not entirely thought out, very little changes from season to season, and there is very little incentive to play the game other than building because you enjoy building. The personalities of villagers all seem one dimensional with many of their responses being generically used for all other villagers and often when talking with them I get an ""insert text here"" instead of actual dialog. Melvin, for example, is old and his knees hurt. That is pretty much his entire personality.

Building is basic and simple (this is good).

Landscaping come in early stages of the game by exchanging permit point to Landscape License. We will also get the recipes to craft paths, bridges, stairs.

The map area is so big, consist of different biomes which have different resources and creatures. For example:
1. You will have to go to Pine Forest to farm Hardwood (although some hardwood trees can also found in other biomes) and Pine Forest also has Bush Devil an aggressive animal that chase you even though you ran away far enough.
2. You will have to go to Bushland biome to get Yellow wattle flower and there are different insect that will appear specifically in Bushland in a certain time / season.
3. You will have to go to Desert or Plain biome to farm stone or ore.
4. etc.

What I really love about the game is:
1. We only need one click and repair kits to restore tools durability. Though Repair tools cost a lot of dinks. In my case, I will use the tools until it's durability limit then repair them at once. Repairing tools is really helpful since craft new durable tools will cost you so much ore.
2. Landscaping is easy. However, I will be so glad if James can give us more space in the wheelbarrow. But that's okay for me. We only need to buy more wheelbarrow right.
3. Making a pond is fun for me, though I have to make water path before the water go to the space I prepare for the pond. Please let the fish I capture can be release in the pond.
4. Capturing animals for research is fun activity. I struggle to catch the animals, but after i figure it out how. it's really fun. I can capture crocodile, bush devils which give me 12K dinks. My next experiment will be alpha animals. xD.
5. Fulfilling camp visitor is exciting because if we succeed, the will want to stay at our town and our town will get bigger.
6. The game is not only about building a prosperous island and decorating it but there are some challenges like aggressive animals that will chase us and attack us, defeating alpha animals, or finding special NPC like Ted Shelly.
7. I love the idea of transportation because the map is really big.
8. The option of single player and multiplayer is also fun. I can invite my friends to join my island or I don't have to be afraid of losing my island progress when joining their island.
9. There are farming, ranching, and fishing features in this game which I really like. With addition almost all of the wild plants, trees, and bushes have seed that we can plant near our base or plant as decoration. The trees and some bushes will definitely useful for stamina and health or for making dinks. And the residents also helps us watering our crops, petting our ranch animals.
10. Stamina and Health Bar limit can be increased to maximum by eating some foods. It helps a lot when dealing with Alpha Animals, Glowing Croco, Bush Devils or Landscaping, gathering resources, mining, fishing, farming, ranching, etc.

The issue that I am still dealing with is going to deep mine: the entry permit is just one time permit cost 25K dinks. So expensive for me and well, the animals there, especially glowing croco will deal massive damage. If we didn't max our health bar limit, then we will die instantly by just one hit from glowing croco.

And if I may give a suggestion:
1. Can we raise fish in the pond or fish can spawn in the pond that we made.
2. Because exploring the island need a lot of time, please slow down the time. Because some creatures only appear in certain times and certain biomes, I often cannot fulfill the residents request because the times is passed.
3. Can we use water bucket to fill an area with water to make pond instead of digging and making water path.
4. Please gives us ATM that available in Town Hall that can be accessed after 4 or 6 p.m. Because I've ever encountered Ted Shelly accidentally and when I went to the bank, the bank was closed. I couldn't withdraw my savings. Fortunately, I still could sell hunting loots to Ted Shelly, so I can bought the weapon from him.
5. Please give us the opportunity to save the game anytime.

I like how this game blends the best mechanics of games similar to it, to create a masterpiece of hunter gatherer gameplay mixed with community planning. Great value for the price you pay, especially if you get the game on sale.

Multiplayer with my partner has been really fun, with the limitation that only the person hosting the game can change island outcomes. Anybody visiting is just there to help gather resources and explore.

My experience with early access ""bugs"" is a mislabelled piece of furniture, or a wild animal staying underwater for a few days. Not game breaking but bizarre and hilarious.

Walking around the map sometimes I'll hit an invisible wall (or the controls are just derping) and go in a straight line regardless until I stop the player.
Control scheme is all over the place, every time a dialog switches to a mouse confirmation option, the mouse is automatically in the far right corner (extremely annoying in general, let alone on large resolutions) Why not make this like interaction confirmations, left/right click, accept/cancel etc?
Saving requires you sleep in a bed, which is great... However, if you crash before that time... (O`,,'o)... There's no forced save and apparently no auto-save either... Weee, back through the intro I go.

I was so wrong.

I started up Dinkum and I was hooked. It just felt right the moment I got past the opening scene. I regret not playing this sooner because I have been playing it as soon as I finish and get home from work pretty much every day since the first day. My friend is getting annoyed at me for asking her every evening to play with me chanting ""Dinkum time, Dinkum time, Dinkum time~!"" -- I may be addicted... Maybe.

This game is a perfect mix of Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons and Animal Crossing: New Horizons with the twist of it being in a post-apocalyptic (?) Australia. It's amazing! There's a lot of potential here and despite being version 0.5 at the time of typing this, it already has a lot of content.

Since it's in Early Access it does have a few bugs and ""Need text here"" dialogues. Bugs are especially common when playing with my friend online, but they're not game-breaking as far as I've seen. A Common bug I encounter again and again that is a bit annoying is that when two fish bite the lure at the same time and I pick up both, the fish models disappear and I battle two fish at the same time, but only get one of them.

There are a few suggestions I have that I hope will make it into the game at some point; mostly QOL features in form of new items/furniture so it's something to work towards. Like for example I hope that there's going to be a workbench chest/box where if you put it next to a crafting station that the station next to it then takes the items in the storage for crafting in addition to your inventory. Or a fridge where the items in there will be available for the cooking station as well as the inventory if put within 2 blocks of the cooking station.

I'm also hoping that maybe in the future there will be NPCs that can come to your island that aren't just shop owners, but normal citizens. I understand that might be a bit cheat-y because of the hangout system but maybe it can be done so they just follow you around and don't really do anything or are only available on certain days. I wish that NPCs will have some story, etc. as well in the future when content-wise/time-wise there's still room to add that before release. Or maybe as some extra content in the future after release.

That being said, I really highly recommend this game, even in Early Access. It's a lot of fun already, even when playing solo.",1677523277,1677523277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

(Side note: I have never played animal crossing on the switch, but had an interest and heard this was similar. I have played Animal Crossing:New Leaf on the 3DS.)

Pros:
-Calming atmosphere. Really nice music and many friendly animals and people. 
-Lots to explore. The island is pretty big. 
-Awesome mapping features. Help make the island seem smaller than it is and help in navigating areas. 
-Different vehicle options. I only have a boat right now, but next time the scientist visits, I'll upgrade. 
-Almost a double jump. You can jump pretty high in this game. 
-Intro cut scene. Caught me off guard when it played. 
-Fishing. Took me a minute to understand the fishing mechanic, but once I learned, I enjoyed and welcomed the challenge. 
-Upgradable inventory. I like getting on a new level. 
-Pretty water. Everything looks nice and cute....*
-Loads quickly. Barely takes any time to load the game. 
-Pause in menu options. 

Cons:
-Targeting. Whether it's picking up items or fighting a croc, I have problems targeting the the right thing. For item pickup, you have to create distance to pick up the item. For enemies, that may be me just learning how to hunt, but it seemed rigged lol
-Cost of items. The store is tew mooch. 
-John. Overpricing store owner. 
-Placement near tent. I can't set objects right next to my tent. Weird gap in between. Maybe for posts at corner. Idk. 
-Lack of Lore. I need more drama. Like, someone running from the cops to my island, and I don't find out until later. More cut scenes lol
-Fishing. The fish ignore my line and my character doesn't turn smooth enough for me to get the correct degree. Not sure if bait upgrade will be in the future of play.
-*...besides the characters. Need more customization. May come with more visitors though. 
-Can only save when characters sleep. 
-Needs an optional tutorial. You kind of have to figure things out on your own. 

This game also reminds me of Ooblets, but without collection aspect, iykyk. But I am enjoying. Surprised at my game play time. Anyway, if you like a calm with a lil bit of challenge, play this.

I recommend this, at its current price, because it's a simple little game that scratches that AC itch but has enough variety on the formula to feel fresh.

These are just some random ideas I had. Some may be too extra xD, but regardless here they are:

World:
I would love to see bigger maps, or maybe even a way to unlock more parts of the world to explore. A way to haul stuff in a car to allow for more expansion and longer journeys? I'm looking forward to more bugs, fish and animals. As we unlock more areas to the world maybe incorporate the new areas for specific new animals, bugs and fish? That could be a fun way of adding them. Where we had to sail across the waters to get to the new lands and possibly later game connecting the teleporters all together.

Mining:
maybe have certain caves spread out throughout the map that only allow certain ores to be found would be cool and even adding new ores. 

People: I'm looking forward to seeing more people to interact with as well as hearing more about their stories, possibly getting some cut scenes would be awesome!  It would be cool to see how multiplayer can advance as well. It would be nice to have the opportunity to trade with the fellow residents. Maybe having certain quests we can pick to unlock specific Items we want to learn? Also for hanging out with the residents it would be quite interesting if you could pick certain tasks to do together for a limited time. Example: I ask John to go out fishing with me and I get to keep those fish we both catch, then there being a time limit on how long we can do the activity together. Houses for the actual residents, so they aren't just wandering around past a certain time. These houses can come alongside the original deed or be an extra one you have to give them.

Skills:
I like how the permit points are and I would love to see more things we can unlock and maybe even new skills to get access to. For example Construction and Farming. I know there is technically already those in a way, but having more to unlock. Where for a farmer your crops have a higher chance of growing faster if you upgrade the fertilizer, or the water is better on the crops if it's filtered. The construction permit will have more building upgrades.",1677008310,1677107327,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

A cozy world to walk around and people to talk to, build friendship with that talk in familiar jumbled language (Which I presume to be Australian). 

The game is very open to the point that the world can feel somewhat empty, but note this is an early access game and there's still a lot to do and find. Deserts for instance which initially seem deserted are actually loaded with trash buried just under the surface. What a find! A true Australian experience. 

As an honorary Australian you can do things such as; Collect spiders, Fight crocodiles, flirt with old women but also not know who's a man or woman (Common problem in Australia) and also colonize an Island by racking up tremendous debts to build things such as a bug and fish museum. Fascinating subjects to all. 
Overall the game is very fun and If they continue to add more I expect they'll continue to see a growing fanbase. 

A few things I'd like to see; 

More things in the world, region unique resources for instance to encourage travel. Fruit is great to this purpose and encourages you to bring it home and plant a food forest. Which I did in the desert. Who knew it was that easy? 

A block or dodge for combat. You can literally run around enemies and jump over stuff pretty easy anyhow. But it'd be nice to have at least one little wrinkle the distinguishes swinging an axe from swinging a cricket bat with teeth stuck to it when engaging in mortal combat with mutant wombat. 

Some consistency on interactions. Something I struggle with is right click left click, E on how to use various things. Maybe I just need to rebind the keys to comfort.

Region specific buildings/bonuses? It'd be neat to have a reason to spread out your village, or finding the perfect place for certain structures that will encourage travel overland.",1676977984,1676977984,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

TLDR; If you love Animal Crossing you will enjoy Dinkum.


I rarely purchase early access games as it's difficult to gauge how ""complete"" a game is before purchasing. The overwhelmingly positive reviews and reasonable sale price enticed me and here I am - 100+ hours in.

While compared to Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley, Dinkum most closely resembles Animal Crossing. Harvest Moon and Stardew are fleshed-out towns with citizens, existing buildings, and very few (if any) new characters move in. Dinkum is different in that nobody lives on this island except for you and Fletch until you bust your butt to move them in. Bust your butt in this case means talking to potential residents, doing errands for them (fetch quests), and buying from their limited wares. I say limited, but once they move into your town their available inventory expands.

A bug/fish/sea creature museum feels very AC, as does the ""visitor tent."" A shady salesman in a boat sounds awfully familiar too - but no need to worry about wasting your dinks on bootleg artwork. 

The Gameplay:
The gameplay is enjoyable and the animations crisp. This area far exceeded my expectations for an early access game. Fishing, farming, bug catching, hunting, and decorating allows for a variety of game play styles. There are some mild clipping issues but nothing that has posed an issue.

I would love tutorial quests. For example, Fletch asks you to plant some crops and the game explains to you what you need, where to get it, etc. I spent 40+ hours confused that I had to buy seeds/tools from a specific villager. Once this information is explained to the player it could be added to the in-game wiki tab.  I was growing watermelons and pumpkins to create scarecrows and the birds kept eating them. Thanks to reddit I discovered that birds can't cross fences so I crafted a bunch and never lost another crop. This isn't a big deal as I have nothing but time. If I had put in 40 hours in the office and wanted to come home to play a game only to not understand the mechanics I might not have continued playing.
I still haven‚Äôt figured out animal trapping and I managed to catch several fish but I'm not sure how I did it :)

I was so excited for the motorbike but I found the controls to be entirely too sensitive. I play with a  controller and the amount of times I revved up only to find myself in a river outnumbers the amount of times I steered with ease.  I found the lawnmower tedious to use, very slow, and stiff to steer. Although I haven't purchased a tractor yet I would love to have a grass cutting attachment. Larger area to cut, etc.   I have had no other issues with any of the vehicles. In fact, gliding around my island makes me ridiculously happy. I could have a whole game of just gliding around!

I'm not a huge fan of hunting or deep mines as I'm more for a relaxing gaming experience. I think that many players would enjoy these areas, but the deep mines left me feeling panicked. The bats are overabundant and out of the dozens I've slayed I've earned one bat wing. Thanks to the magic of mods, I've been able to freely traverse the deep mines and take my time without the anxiety of being lost in the cavernous abyss. 

Music:

The music is pleasant, but I would prefer to have more variety of music that plays continually. There are times when the music ends and the world feels a little empty aside from a few bird calls.

Characters: 

The character design is cute and the voices are very Animal Crossing - that's not a bad thing.

The only time this game feels early access is with the limited number of characters that move into your town. There is minimal if no backstory, the same dialogue is repeated multiple times, and the ""text needed"" message is shown for nearly every character when you speak to them. The frequency of the ""text needed"" message varies but I'm sure this will be remedied in future updates. One last note on dialogue:  I would like to have some sort of character development as you raise friendship levels. Surely the cranky banker wouldn't stay cranky forever would he?

New players: stock up on moon butterflies and flies. Once a day I have a villager asking for one.

Perhaps I am spoiled by Animal Crossing where visitors are enticed to stay after visiting the campsite but I would love to see more villagers who aren't just shopkeepers. Surely I‚Äôm not the only one in town who are providing all the economy to this island. I'd love to see more characters who are more than the products they sell.

Clothing and furniture:

I don‚Äôt feel strongly about the clothing or furniture. I‚Äôd like to see that using it raises the beauty score of the island. I don‚Äôt have any reason to buy it as I only go into my house at night to sleep. The ability to design your own clothing or paths would be a nice addition but again, Animal Crossing has spoiled me.

My Wishlist for quality of life improvements:

-It would be great to be able to craft from storage boxes that are nearby. I'm currently using a mod that allows this.
-I would like to see what season to plant which crops added to the in-game wiki
-I would like to see how much items sell for when I hover over them in my inventory
-Auto-pickup would be a very welcome addition. For anyone who is harvesting many crops it becomes tedious to have to click once to harvest and click again to pick it up. 
-The ability to turn off aggression in animals. Sometimes I just want to terraform and decorate my island without being charged by an irate crocodile.
-The ability to craft multiple items at once
-Once you've reached level 100 at a skill it would be nice to have an unbreakable variant of the corresponding tool/tools
-The beauty score is confusing - One day I'm at 94% the next 77% without making any changes to my island.

Original review:
This game has been incredibly frustrating so far. The first time I opened it it crashed right away. Was able to reopen and play for an hour and then crashed and wasn't able to save. Relaunched and started over again, played about an hour again and crashed right as I rolled out the sleeping bag, again I wasn't able to save. I'm debating if I want to try and play again or not. I get it's early access but it's disappointing that I'm not able to get passed the first in-game day. 

if the developer sees this I would advise a manual save option instead of the sleeping bag being the only save point.",1676170671,1676924548,True,0,0,0.482352942228317261,0,True,False,True

Also, movement is free flowing. Although there are heavy similarities to Animal Crossing, I prefer Dinkum due to the mechanics and how easy it is to swap tools. Hunting is always a plus.

This game is developed by one bloke named James, from Australia. It will probably take this bloke named James, a bloody long while to get to 1.0, however the content that is here is very fleshed out. Some might even say Girthy. Strewth!

I see a lot of people commenting on how it's Animal Crossing mixed with Stardew Valley put in an Australian BBQ without any Prawns. I kinda disagree in many aspects (1000 hours in Animal Crossing over here), but IT IS a Farming Sim... and comes with all the pros and cons that a classic farming sim has, whilst adding it's own unique flavours to the formula.

I would give this a 9.5, but I cannot do that to an early access game. ALSO... their are NO Drop Bears or Bin Chickens in the game (currently as of Feb 2023)... so the highest I can go is 8.5...

Apart from that, this game is highly addictive... and incredibly chill. 
James (that one bloke from Australia) has created something very charming and very cosy.
Whilst the Character Customisation is currently lacking... it's still early days... and the content in here already, is actually really incredible for a one person team.

HOWEVER! There are a few terrible game decisions in the game, which I will list here.
- Time speeds through a little too quick, and days feel like you're just unable to get done, what you need to be done... and what you want to be done. This is very bad for anyone with ADHD.
- Energy feels unbalanced, and when combined with the time speed, it can make some days feel very unfun.
- There is a Mine that is locked behind game progress (which is great!)... but also it requires a lot of resources and dinks (money) to travel down there... and it's very hectic down there... and I probably just need to get good. 
- I will say this again... there are NO Drop Bears or Bin Chickens in the game. This is a crime against Australians...

Pros: 
Beautiful world with a unique take on farming and exploring, and adventuring. 
Adorable creatures, interesting lore and building system. 
Australians

John is reminds me of my youth pastor, way to eerily so.

Making your first scarecrow is VERY expensive since it needs the grown crops the birds will be eating so you better care for 10 pumpkins in hoping you get one out of it.
Having to pay, what, 30 grand every single time you want to go into the mine is wild for a building that is already expensive.
Not many quests or general sense of direction; go get 5 residents by doing a load of fetch quests and unlocking that many merchants.
It's a slow grind to unlock merchants, but then you don't really have anything to do any more - no endgame yet.

Problem is the core gameplay loop just isn't that good - it doesn't have much engagement with the fixed villagers like Stardew and it doesn't have the variety of different townsfolk like AC (only seen merchants move in) so it's a weird unwelcome middle-ground.

On top of harvesting, mining, crafting, farming and cooking, there's weapon crafting for combat. There's a wide variety of animals to hunt and even aggressive/alpha boss animals to fight. And there's animal handling, to provide certain materials such as eggs, milk, wool, and even to use as a mount. There's vehicles (animal mounts, boats, motorcycles, gliders), which comes in handy since the world is pretty large and takes some time to explore on foot.

- Combat: Quite possibly the least engaging combat mechanics created in several years. I'm not asking for an isometric Dark Souls, but the bat enemy is among the most baffling design choices ever made. Aiming a 2-dimensional attack on an enemy which darts about and attacks in 3-dimensions is every bit as tedious as it sounds. Not to mention the perma-repeating attack patterns of the crocs / every other enemy, it's so painfully simple.

- Fishing: every fish pulls away from the bait at the same rate / pattern. So fishing is entirely a rinse / repeat / robotic process. To randomise this would be so trivial, how has this functionality been allowed to be written like this? There's zen gameplay and then there's whatever this is.

- Until today, mouse forward/back would alter the camera angle / player perspective. But now, it zooms in/out of the player. Is this a bug, or a feature? Why go out of your way to make this change. More baffling design choices.

- Can you define somewhere, clearly, that when you faint + revive, all of your gear gets hit with damage? Almost everything else is defined, except this rather important detail. The choices of omission made in this game are genuinely baffling.

- Inventory management. Look at how terraria / minecraft lets you stack / auto-stack to chest / pick ONE item from a stack of x. The very bare minimum has been done here - and this is not good enough considering how much time you spend in the inventory screens / your chests. More endless clicking. More tedium.

- No automation whatsoever. So much scope for more interesting automation mechanics. If I have to saw 300 woods and cook 200 apples and 10 fish, that is my real-life afternoon written off right-clicking on the saw mill 300 times, then the BBQs 210 times, to make this happen one-at-a-time. Painstaking, devastating, and again, not-zen gameplay.

Stardew valley is Zen. Animal crossing is Zen. Terraria can be incredibly Zen.

This, is an own-brand local-repo end-of-semester-project knockoff designed to do the bare minimum, and proceeds to patronises you instead. It's great at the start. but you -will- hit that stage where you will feed your 600th gum-wood into the saw mill, and find yourself wishing you had spent your gameplay hours doing -literally- anything else.",1676613657,1676613842,False,9,1,0.553721249103546143,0,True,False,True

There's a lot to chew on before you start to feel the effects of early access. However you inevitably start to notice the visual glitches and shared dialogue between the NPCs. The game also does a bad job of communicating some of its systems and you often have to rely on trial and error to figure them out, sometimes resulting in costly mistakes.

At the time of writing this, the game is still early access and I know the dev is working hard on the next update, which I'm assuming will address the typos and grammatical errors that pop up throughout the dialogue and make my eye twitch involuntarily. 

There's also the issue of the dialogue menus being difficult to navigate. If you're like me, you have a habit of button-mashing through dialogue to get to the dialogue options (let's chat, I have something for you, etc). Doing this leads to the first dialogue option being pressed, which drives me insane and wastes time that would be better spent getting eaten by crocodiles or chased by rabid birds. After 20 hours of gameplay, I have not been able to break the habit.

Please Mr Dev, make it so I can't accidentally press the first dialogue option due to my own impatience. This is ingrained in my vidya gaming, my almost-40 year old brain can't rewire for this. It's my only real complaint, the game is otherwise fantastic and I'm looking forward to shirking my real-life responsibilities so my town can grow big and strong.",1676532661,1676533020,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I think some things could be reworked like the sounds for hitting stuff like stones as well as the animations for certain things. One thing that comes to mind is catching bugs, your character immediately jumps forward and shows of the catch in an unnatural way I guess. This is a really dumb nitpick, maybe I'm crazy. 
The map is... decent, as to say it could be a lot better. The world generation gets the job done but there's lots of annoying little useless continents on it, like the map gets unnaturally split into different islands and chunks because the rivers don't really form well, like I have lots of rivers cutting what would be really cool pretty land into awkward slices of land and sand that can't be really used for anything honestly.

I've seen it described as primarily an Animal Crossing/Stardew melding but I think it's honestly more Animal Crossing meets Minecraft with some Stardew elements thrown in. To me it seems like all of the best elements of each of those games combined, and the co--op so far has been pretty seamless and easy to manage. 

Unlike ACNH, where friends can only visit and marginally assist with your building and progression, the Dinkum co-op mode allows visitors to sleep on the island and help with day to day tasks more like Minecraft co-op. The fishing takes a little bit to get the hang of--I did not find the simplistic explanation from youtubers helpful at all, but once you figure out the rhythm of it, it's very satisfying as a minigame. Some of the positioning of RDR2, the tension reeling play of New World, and the bobber mechanics of ACNH. 

NPCs and town progression works closely to ACNH, so players familiar with that game will have an easier time intuiting what to hold on to while progressing and what to vendor for quick cash. 

I am just really loving it a lot and would recommend it to families and friends who want a chill multiplayer town building game to enjoy together.

1) I play the game using switch controllers. it makes it easier but none of the buttons match the commands so it was a huge trial and error to figure out what button did what. Not sure if its the same for all controllers but it did make things a little challenging. 

2) You can still get attacked while in the menus/ journals. It doesnt pause your time or creatures so you could pull up the journal, thinking its paused and come back 10 minutes later and a whole day passed or you got your nards chewed off by a croc and you're dead. The only way to pause is to pull up the actual pause in the settings and do it that way. 

3) The only way to save the game is to go to sleep and have a new day start. So either you finish out your day and call it good or stop where you are to exit and loose the whole day and have to start over. Its annoying for those times when you want/ need to stop in the middle of a day and cant save it where you are without loosing all your progress or have to sleep early just to save it and not loose anything.",1676307381,1676307381,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

In fact, coming from Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the integration of multiplayer and designing and building our town together was a breath of fresh air.  Things just worked.

The only irritation was that there is a bit of random grind with some rare key items that could only be found by digging up treasure.

One thing I don't like about Dinkum (and why drawing a comparison to Minecraft might be a bad choice) is how very little you can dig into the ground, like, I think max depth is 5 blocks below sea level and you can't dig into cliff sides to make caves and such.

This truly is a fascinating game. It is a different take on the game genre. 
The graphics fits with the games overall feel, the controls are simple and the main mission is crystal clear.
Yet the thought that went into the gathering of resources, creation of more advanced ones and the fighting system is something you really need to think about before you dive in head first. Not meant in a bad way at all, it is fun to have a game that challenges you to think before you act.

However, the fishing system is annoying and difficult for no reason. It is not relaxing like AC fishing, more towards SV. It's like a 1 second time frame for you to click or else the fish goes away. I just find it extremely frustrating. Not just that, the farming is stupid. You have to worry about birds and kangaroos eating away your crops. If you had 10 crops, with no scarecrow, expect one or zero crops remain. I wish the chances of my crops getting eaten wasn't that high. Sure, I will make a scarecrow but the pumpkin used to make the scarecrow all got eaten. I personally think the first year is repetitive. I've been stuck in this area of unable to get more npc on my island due to constantly waiting for them to come back and have their heart only increasing a quarter or so. I can't expand my town nor go mining because I haven't unlocked certain crafting plans/npc.

I do get burned out sometimes though but that's because I played like 11 hours at a time. In all honesty, it is the perfect combination of Stardew valley, animal crossing and Minecraft. So if you love those games, download this one. I do have to say that while the game is amazing, it does have somethings i wish i could add (i know it's in its early stages), so i hope some suggestions could help this game get even better.
          - A bucket for water (so we dont have to dig from the ocean into the island to make a water spring or a 
             pond, which is tedious, but can use a bucket or water dispensor to dispense water)
          - more shops and npc's (restaurant, grocery store, coffeeshop, bakery, wood shop, mineral shop, music 
             shop, seed market, etc)
          - change the way fertilizer look different on the crop feild (i have really bad tryphobia, and maye some 
             other players to, and the holes in the soil make me really uncomfortable so maybe change the way it 
             looks?)
          - more than 4 people can join + more visitor houses 
          - more interactive options with npc's
               - npc's can accept gifts
               - npc's wear the clothing you give/gift them 
               - more npc's ask to buy things off of you
               - relationship + marry npc's
               - sally can do makeup
          - design clothing
          - recharchable items (dirt printer etc.) dont break when reaching 0%
          - buy multiple from johns (like ore or tools)
          - plates as furniture (be able to cook food and place it on them)
          - furniture spacing is changed (furniture can be put together closer)
          - more decorative things (furniture, garden, town stuff)
               - tea set furniture
               - fish tanks/insect tanks for ourselves 
          - character has a bigger appetite (appetite is dependant on what food you eat)
          - lawn mower is easier to control (mows 4 fields at once not just one)
          - More things to get from Franklyn
                - bigger bombs (break bigger rocks)
                - more tools (ore detector, fossil detector, etc)
          - higher chance of getting wires / or npc to buy those things off
          - more island area (snow biom, etc, maybe somewhere to travel)
          - more fruit options
          - mine two floors where it gets harder
                - bigger bosses
                - more minerals
          - more animals (cats, flamingo, peacock)
          - more control over dogs (whistle, commands)
          - house can have rooms or be bigger (guest houses aswell)
          - be able to move the docs or customize it
          - bridge size adjustable (1-10 blocks wide and length bigger)
          - liscense to increase health or stamina
          - minigames to play with friends ingame
          - round fences/hedges
          - backpacks

It's similar to games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, but with an Australian feel. There's even a museum you can unlock to donate fish, bugs, and critters to. So, it's perfect for people who enjoy collections.

Pros:
-There is a lot to unlock and you can build pretty much anywhere.
-Money is pretty easy to come by in the game. It gets even easier the further you get into the game
-A lot of the animals are cute, and it is easy to get your friendship up with your farm animals.
-Vehicles can be unlocked, making travel across the island pretty quick.
-There are books that can be unlocked for fish and bugs that can make it pretty easy to find the ones you haven't caught yet, or just locate one you need for a side quest.
-For the most part, the game is pretty relaxing. Combat is the only time it isn't, but you really don't have to fight anything if you don't want to.
-The creator is still making improvements to the game and taking feedback into consideration. So, that's always a plus.

Cons:
-I've noticed that if I play for a while, spawns on my island for bugs, fish, and creatures seems to plummet. It's easy enough to fix by exiting to desktop and reopening the game.
-The villager quests can get pretty repetitive, whether it is on a bulletin board, or just a daily request. It's to be expected with these kinds of games, but why do so many people need me to catch flies for them?
-I haven't seen a way to move water to make a pond or anything. I have managed to make one by digging a path from the ocean to where I wanted a pond, but it was a bit of a hassle. I would love to see a tool like the dirt printer for water, or even just a water bucket or hose to move water.
-I don't really like that the people that move to the island only have their shops. They don't have houses. With all of the space for building, I would love to have a house for each of them too. This way I can have residential and shopping districts and make the town feel even more alive.

Overall, there is already a ton to do in this game, and the creator is adding more. So, if you love games full of crafting and building, I would highly recommend this game.",1675908165,1675908165,True,110,3,0.901123046875,0,True,False,True

Some things that I found while gaming:
Most of these are spoilers so read at your own caution, and is more or less a complain/improvement list. Some of these are addressed in Official discord.
- At this point, with the current mechanics I don't see much replayability potential.
- Singleplayer =150 fps, mp with 1person = 70 fps. After building a bit = 34 fps at certain spots.
- view/render distance is sort of limited, even with maxed out settings.
- slight direction adjustment on with keyboard+ mouse is very hard
- default minimap zoom is to close, there are QoL mods for this.
- your map is tied to your character. want to regenerate map, make new char( and all that comes with it)
- multiplayer progression is only for host, and only host can progress buildings. That is, host has to get 2/5 stars with NPC for it to move in. All Clients have no purpose to do so other than random blueprints or rewards, because the NPC seems to be tied to the map. Same for statistics of town only counts from host. As client you are more of a visitor with building rights and not much more progression wise ( you can progress your licenses tho)
- when fishing and casting line, you can adjust left/right, but no way to tell how much you have adjusted, the face of char seems to be looking a lot different angle than where the cast lands. Sometimes its 90 degree.
-in multiplayer, client using chairs/bed and host not using them will desync client occasionally requiring to restart game.

[spoiler]
- silo holds 200, but i have to click 200 times to fill it... why not hold to fill it, or sell 200 units bag.
- when harvesting trees, requires to click every tree to get the fruits on the ground then click again to collect them. Now you can hold and vacuum all fruits around by walking but you cant do that with trees, continious tree harvesting, same goes for large field. lots of clicking. this could be improved.
- no batch crafting. Want 200 nails? click 1 recipe and wait, click 1 recipe and wait, click and wait...
- when there is a row of trees, the camera is above the trees and i cant see which tree im clicking so i end up with half harvested trees, either above solution, or first person camera.
- when mining/chopping and aiming at the deposit/tree it will switch sideways 1 block and attack the wild animal if there is one. I have no intention harming doggos, now i have to slaughter it before it howls.
- the guitar does not always work, sometimes i have to spam it for half a minute.
- interacting with boat, the interaction area is very small, when fishing its very hard to start pedalin boat again because there is no precise controls. Waterscooter is a lot easier.
- game is ok for first play-through, but once you reach midgame(year 2?), you have more money than you know how to spend it.
- you need to do favors for residents/NPC to acquire blueprints... i got spinwheel in year 2 summer.
- favor /mission recipes are not on par with item requested. Bring me 30k worth fish and I will pay you 1k dinks.. LOL
- Sometimes NPC asks for things like cherry???( special holiday item)
- all seasons last 28 days,day 01 in new season you can still harvest last season veggy, but day 02, all your field turns to dead,including fertilizer, so you lose fertilizer, but this is not issue once you captured 50 roos and farm their poo.
- tractor is eh, Australian? it goes wrong direction in reverse,like any other machine in game.
- game it self lacks depth( for replay) and complexity for processing. Harvest,sell. thats about it. You got to buy seeds from NPC 99 at a time, trough 5 dialog boxes for each attempt.
- more than half of the food is not avail at first year ish, because you cant grow potat,onion,beans etc, and when you can they are not relevant anymore because game mechanics are quite easy/no need for special foods cus you got chainsaw,or drill. So deff some balance could be done there.
- there is build height limit, such as radio tower has to be on sea level as it is already at max height, building at higher altitude will yield you interesting results...
- chargable things dissapear once they discharge, such as drill, chainsaw,compactor, etc they also cost 300k ish which seems a lot at start, but you get lots of dinks from selling veggy/crops
- the special guy on ship that buys bulk only appears in rainy days which is fine, but you need bank, which is fine,but you need 1 mil in bank... And you can only sell for dinkums, and buy for license points. So not sure why the 1mil requirment. Once you have 1 mil you already have means to make tons of money and selling for double price in bulk is pointless cus there is no use for the millions you acquire.

It's been a ton of grinding and I can get money pretty easily, but I don't have something I'm shooting for. Once I'm used to the gameplay loop, I'm left thinking, ""why am I still playing?"" 

Ultimately I think it boils down to me not caring about the citizens. I make a new building when I can and force myself to talk to them so I can get hearts, but I just really don't care about what they have to say. They all have cookie cutter personalities. For example, the shopkeeper is all about work and money. Boring.

I think another part of the problem is going into the game trying to maximize what you are doing every single day. It leads to really long days where you are cooking at midnight for 10 real minutes because it takes no energy and you don't pass out. So why do it when the clock is ticking during the day? The days just feel too long.

Overall just an eh game. I'm hoping it gets more interesting content and QOL improvements down the road. It goes on the shelf for a while.

It has it's issues, the controls are clearly designed around a controller so it's pretty janky trying to point your character in the right direction.

Pausing is now a thing, although it's bizarrely implemented: rather than just pressing P or something to pause you have to press Escape, go to options, then click pause.....

I was a bit put off at first by the art style(I thought the square heads were ugly, sorry, they've grown on me since, though). I finally decided to give it a shot and it is so much fun. I can absolutely see the inspiration taken from both animal crossing, with the citizens' voices, and bug catching, and filling the museum, and creating your own little town, and stardew valley, with the farming, and animal rearing, and day cycles, and mines(I hope the creator does not tire of these sorts of comments, I truly mean them as compliments). With almost 90 hours in the game, I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what there is available to explore. The game gives you plenty of goals to work towards, but often I find myself creating my own tasks to complete. It's fun to give yourself a little to-do list of things you want to do before it gets too late and you run out of energy, but I almost never feel like I NEED to rush to get things done. Very, very, very fun casual game. I love getting creative control over the entire island. I would've appreciated a little explanation of how the mines work before going down there the first few times, but a lot of the fun in the game is found in slowly uncovering all the little secrets of the island, so that's not /really/ a criticism. I'm struggling to come up with any criticisms of the game, other than that I wish there was a way to move the camera around my character without having to hold down shift all the time on mouse and keyboard. I'm pretty picky and I love putting in my two cents, so, coming from me, that is very high praise.

Game is fun casual town management game, with farming, and light dungeon combat elements.
It's not really hard either, money is fairly easy to mass produce (giant orchard farms) though it takes a little time to get started proper.
There are issues with it as its still fairly early, seasons don't do much visually but have a major impact on fish, bugs, and what you can farm so I've caught myself trying to plan winter crops in summer.
Accuracy to Australia is a little off, while most of the larger wild life will try to kill you, bugs that should be an issue aren't I'd like to see some aggressive Spiders that can poison you and either sap max health/stamina or knock you out. Also moving some things to more natural environments (I'm told you should be finding huntsman spiders in caves instead of in the bush lands per my Australian friends.)

Multi-player is interesting as it's character importing, but seems if you don't save(sleep) and log off immediately, you can loose character progress (saw a friend loose a bunch of money after logging out from my world after selling stuff. This makes sense but would like an alert reminder ""Hey if you leave now you'll loose all of today's progress.""

Looking at the average score most people really like this game. Personally there are things in the basic gameplay that I don't like and it sort of ruins the game for me.

For one I spend half of my time running (slowly) back to my tent because I'm exhausted. Then I wake up, run back to those palm trees, cut down a few more and again run back to my tent to sleep. I really don't understand why this is necessary or fun. This is the biggest issue for me.

There are smaller issues like quests I can't do. Storage units that need to be organized like having a virtual sock drawer. No queues for production (at least at the point where I am). Small inventory that does get bigger as I buy upgrades but come on why can actual full size logs stack but butterflies can't? Also clumsy combat is something we see all the time in other games like this but.. why? If combat is a bit part of the game why make it so annoying?

Personally I don't mind having to grind materials a bit or hunt something a few times before I'm able to make progress but the gameplay has to feel fun. Dinkum is kinda fun, kinda not. I suppose since it's early access things can still change.

I'm thinking this game will appeal to some like they're handing out buckets for free and that's fine. Personally I'm not 100% convinced yet. Still Dinkum is a good game but perhaps not for everyone. I don't regret buying it but we'll see if I keep playing for a lot longer than this 3,5hrs.",1674927832,1674927832,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Dinkum is a cutesy game that looks a bit like animal crossing while the core gameplay is that more like Stardew Valley but a tad less dark which I personally wish would change but I am of the type that likes more realism and such in games. That aside Dinkum is a fun and addicting game with an extremely active Dev who flat out kicks ass. This Dev appears to carefully monitor his bug discussion channel as his frequent hot fixes reflect major common issues players are having. For a one man team, that is pretty damn impressive. For an early access title, it has a considerable amount to do and very few severe bugs. I have only found a few that were either funny (like an npc hovering slightly) or a minor annoyance such as not being able to unequip (but you could swap it) a hat unless you restart the game. One of my favorite things about the game is being able to not only capture animals, but load them on a vehicle and airbus them back to base. That's just sick to me!
        The multiplayer works well and adds a very nice element to the game as when you are starting out there is a lot lot to be done and having a few spare hands makes this more manageable. 

I think the game is very worth the price and I am looking forward to seeing what else the Dev puts in.

A few things that I wish the developer would see and patch: 
-when you tag spots in the mine and then leave the mine, those spots stay on regular map. I have to manually untag each one (I tag my mine spots to remember which areas are cleared so I don't run in circles)
-make watering the crops count towards farm points. so far farming is the only skill that is under 20 with everything else being above 50
-there is a glitch after remodeling a house that either the wall or floor item in your inventory continues to ""collect"" stuff if you ""use"" it (if you have painted the walls from regular to let's say dainty, the regular wall will be dropped into your inventory and if you left click it, it will show it ""collecting"" that item over and over again).",1674511334,1674511334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It also feels very detailed because of the characters that you can get to move into town as well as the myriad of clothing and furniture items you can get.

The problem is that once time goes on, you really get stuck in a quite boring and lackluster loop of talking to everyone in your town and bringing them fish and butterflies without really making a lot of progress elsewhere. This is made worse further by not having the most used options further up in the conversation tree as well as not being able to navigate those with the keyboard. There is also just less and less to do the further you progress. What's also bad is that the sense of exploration is completely absent in this game, although the genre really lends itself to it. The map is completely open from the start, which is fine, but no matter where the biomes are, they feel very similar to each other and there are no secrets or mechanics to find or learn. 
There are also plentiful bugs to find, like houses that you can't enter after having them moved. 

In summary this seems like the basis for a charming game, but right now it could really use some bugfixing, a rebalancing and rethinking of progression and the main gameplay loop, and some late game content.",1674492040,1674492226,False,15,1,0.657690644264221191,1,True,False,True

Unless you find the wiki online there isnt much hope of you working out how to do almost anything as in game guidance is zero. The wiki itself is next to useless but its better than nothing.
The variety of interactions and available quests from NPCs is very limited and get boring quickly.
The graphics are awful even for an indy game and it has possibly the worst in game music I have ever heard. That says something as I start gaming in the 80s on a 48k Specturm. Also, dont start me on the terrible fishing mechanics.

We're still in early chapters but I'm hoping for some more writing/personality out of the townsfolk if you befriend them.  I'm also hoping their ai's cause them to take-in the city, have favorite spots to hang out, etc?  Am curious to see how they respond when the city really gets going.",1674313419,1674313565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You may say it is similar to animal crossing, and for all intent of review that is what I'll be basing my review off of. Dinkum has many things some more mature players would enjoy more than if they were to play animal crossing, such as fishing, which is very much different in mechanics, and is actually quite enjoyable and a challenge. Trading is similar, but still very satisfying. Combat is relaxed but very interesting, as instead of having not many combatants, you really have to watch out for the wildlife around the game, and are able to hunt, capture, and do various things with them. These are some of the features, but overall I give it about a 9/10 for the sake of graphics being just OK, but the features are very much more than expected, such as vehicles, metal detectors, and other fun building quarks that lack in many other games like this.

We got farming/chickens, mining, fishing, trapping/hunting, and foraging to do and they are all pretty fun to jump between. Just overall a fun experience.

Updating my review because this game deserves it:
Dinkum is by all accounts an amazingly fun game. If you like Animal Crossing then this game, is at its core very similar. However it expands on ideas far better and makes new activities beyond just planting fruit trees. Sure you can still go around and collect and plant fruit trees, but you can also craft those fruits into food to manage your stamina and health. OH, a health bar? You're not just avoiding bee's, Hunting animals like crocodiles and fire-breathing... things? That's another occupation you can take up in this game to make money. Mining? Even has a small randomly generated mine to use that resets every day. Farming? 100% A valid way to make money and progress? Wanna just do all the things!? Go for it. 

The game also encourages you to expand your town, or in my case, a prison compound, wherein everyone that comes in gets lured in by my kind acts towards them only to be trapped for me to exploit their businesses to make copious amounts of DINKS (money). In all honesty, designing, decorating, and building up your town is an amazingly fun and rewarding experience in this game. Befriending the colorful cast of characters including literally Steve Irwin is amazing. Worth noting, that I learned this is very ""Australian"" in its inspiration though as a Japanese man who lives under a rock of anime and video games 99% of the references are lost on me. Like needing a liscence for literally everything. Apparently fairy bread is delicious in real life as well. (Dinkum official cookbook when?) 

Early game to end game progression is super fun- however subsequent play thrus wherein you know what you're doing and what to save early as you'll need it soon are super fun as well. The entire game feels surprisingly complete, well put together and fleshed out for something state to be in early access. 

If you like the genres the game is under or got it recommended for those same tags this game is great!",1667807527,1673924679,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

1. The save system. I have a busy life and sometimes cannot finish a day out in order to save. It's 2023 and it just makes so much more sense to save whenever you need to. I have cut short many days from this alone. 

2. The crafting. I find it clunky. My preference would be to allow the player to craft an item without having to craft the intermediate ingredients. For instance, it would ease the burden if instead of having to craft a fire pit and then craft a furnace, if I had the resources needed to do both I could just click to craft the furnace.

It's amazing to learn that all this was done by a single developer... great work!
I really enjoy Dinkum. If you're looking for a casual, relaxing life-sim game, or even something to do with your friends, then this is definitely it! 
I have a girlfriend who is my duo in the game and we both have loads of fun. We spend bout 5-6 hours a day sinking in after work.
One drawback is that if you're playing singleplayer, the progress could be a bit slow. 
Also, I'm looking forward to future updates where there could be more variety of wildlife, animals, NPCs, etc.

This is a game sets in a distant future of Australia, where people don't know what is computer mouse, keyboard, PCB, and smartphone. Also, some animals are evolved / mutated ..... (for example, Tasmania Devil that shoot fireball, Kangaroo with Antlers, Lizard that emit lightning, Platypus with wool and wombat with the size of Cow and you can milk them!)

People in the game are philistine. If you want to make friend with them, you need to buy them something, do a favour for them or buy lots of things from them.

Moreover, if they decide to stay, you have to pay for their house and build it on your own.....

My wife and I love this game. The game feels like all the best parts of stardew valley, mashed up with animal crossing and it works incredibly well. I honestly can't recommend it enough. The amount of work that has probably gone into this game is mindblowing, it feels like everything has been thought of.


To the Dev, (because we love the game so much, here are some things my wife and I came up with as possible improvements)
-Item collapsing/sorting in boxes and in inventory like in stardew valley
-More recipes (it'd be nice to have more variety, recipes with wild fruit, more with crops ect..)
-More variety of wildlife in different seasons
-More NPC's
-Bigger house upgrade, with multiple rooms and floors

-I know this might be far off, but would you ever consider doing other climates?  It'd be cool to have a dinkum, North America, where you get a solid winter, and a colorful fall? just a thought! :)

After wanting to play animal crossing for so long and never being able to play it, I can finally enjoy a game like it.
An excellent game to relax and lose yourself by turning off your brain and just enjoy it.
As I always say... even though many say it feels incomplete and I can understand why, it's an early access game but the truth is that it has a thousand things you can do and none of them are boring, it's immersive, entertaining, relaxing and the music of the game is perfect.
Once you invest a little time, when you least expect it 4 hours have already passed. 
As a suggestion, I think it lacks essential things that it should have as for example, an npc that comes to visit or that fletch gives you a license to travel to different islands where you can investigate and find different biomes, which leads me to the second point that is more diversity of animals and creatures as well as unique collectibles as the ""amber chunk"" either gold Chunks, a large diamond, etc..
Also the possibility to improve the house more times and to have a second floor, a basement or an attic.

Not to mention, very chill Australian themes and style... You're probably going to like Dinkum. 

Most of the game mechanics themselves are very reminiscent of Animal Crossing, such as building up a little town, collecting tickets to unlock everything (like inventory slots, access to better tools, or authorization to use a vehicle or go hunting), a museum, villiger quests, and even the voices are right there with you. The game day is its own fixed length (20-ish minutes? 30-ish?) though, and like in Stardew, isn't tied to your system clock so a day can go by pretty fast.

Unlike in Stardew though; once you hit midnight (2 am in Stardew), you don't just pass out. Your clock display just changes to 'Late', you move a bit slower, and your stamina and max stamina bar gets drastically reduced. BUT providing you have enough food, you can theoretically play 'Late' for hours. I've not fully tested just straight-up blacking out that way, but I have spent a pretty long time cooking up meals and snacks after midnight. And even doing some mining, though I ran out of good food much faster that way. Better to just go to bed and continue whatever project you were on, the next day.

There's not a ton of combat in the game... But, you do have to defend yourself from Crocs, Cassowaries, Sharks, and a few other things; but even that's pretty chill. It's slightly more advanced than Stardew Valley mines, but only in that you have to actually try to dodge attacks. Fortunately, all your foes have obvious tells, and you can even deal with some of the tougher ones, with something basic like a scythe.

I only have a few complaints so far in the game... One is that there is tool decay (like I said, VERY reminiscent of New Horizons) but at least I understand that. In a small world with renewable resources, it doesn't hurt to encourage a player to go out and get more resources. I've just never liked tool decay in any game I've ever played that had it.

The other thing, is that there's no easy way to pause. There's no hotkey for it. There's no main-screen button for it. It doesn't even pause while in menus, or when you ""Tab Out"" or de-focus the game. Technically there IS a way to pause the game and prevent it from advancing time, and marching towards midnight... but it's hidden behind TWO menu options, and doesn't even pause while in THAT menu, until you hit the actual button. I think that MIGHT be tied to the fact that it has multiplayer capabilities. But I've not messed around enough with that to 'get' it. It should be a thing whenever in single player.

Who knows, it IS early access, maybe they'll add it in a future update. But frankly that doesn't matter ALL that much, because it's a very fun and chill game you can unwind with, if that's what you wish. If you ever wanted to play something like Animal Crossing, but on your own Steam account (instead of having to buy an entirely new console that you can't afford *looking at own budget*) this title is certainly worth picking up. You'll get your money's worth. :)",1673511661,1673511661,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I would really like to look forward to their development in terms of story progression and NPC tasks that are not repetitive. And for the time being, there are still more things to be fixed, like zooming in on characters so that they can take a photo close-up (more like a selfie) and improving the landscape mode camera to emphasize your town further. And aside from the current ""[b]Austrailia[/b]"" theme, I hope we'll get more maps to experiment with different types of town building vibes, as well as more animals to discover!

And their growing community on Discord is [b]*chefs kiss*[/b] the most responsive people. They all take the feedback seriously and are more willing to improve your experience. So far I haven't really tried co-op mode as I have always been a solo gamer, but I think it is much better playing it with a friend as you can do a lot of teamwork when working on your growing town (if you're not looking into the progression side of your own character).

This game is a cross between Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley but leaning more towards Animal Crossing gamestyle. They've started to play Dinkum more than Animal Crossing as they say, ""there is more to do."" They reference ""more to do"" as interacting with animals, fighting enemies, interactive daily NPC tasks, deep cave mining and several others that keep a day in Dinkum never the same.

The occasional fighting in game is complex enough there is a learning curve and adults will find themselves with a slight challenge, but basic enough kids can eventually figure it out (very young kids might get frustrated). 

Our biggest complaint is the game only saves if you end the day and sleep. We wish there was another way you could save up to that very moment in the day. Stamina drains fairly quickly and wish there was a way to permanently craft items to increase base amount each day. I can see a lot more animals and interacting with the environment being implemented that would really make exploring even more exciting. Also animal feed seems to disappear sometimes when placed in feeder or inventory. ""Where did all my feed go?!""

On the Store Page it says partial controller support, but I've only run into one issue while changing my keybindings. All gameplay with controller has been fluid and responsive. It would also be nice if it was compatible with Linux.

Crafting and gathering is fun and not super tedious but enough work has to be put forth to complete some quests/tasks before the end of the day (how fast the day goes by could be considered a negative). The tasks seem overall rewarding, depending on your location, and current exploration into that aspect of the game. Fishing also takes a small learning curve but once you figure it out the time it takes to catch fish pays off in the beginning of the game at least. 

A huge positive is there are no loading screens!! I can go in/out of a house/shop and it is instant! Thank you!

The local multiplayer has been flawless but I do hope this continues to grow and be developed. Going from your friends to your island on the fly would be nice. It is great to be able to transfer items into a storage area in Main base that carry over to your game/map if your inventory becomes full. I like that your single player map can also be your multiplayer.  No need to start fresh just because you want to play with others--just host your game and let them join that previously single player game you were on. 

I have bought multiple copies of this game and will continue to buy more as I feel it is a great social game for any friends/family that want to play single or multiplayer. Even in Early Access this game has plenty to keep you occupied for hours. The developer seems to be very open and communicates well with community. Gives me hope this game will be a top game throughout the years to come.

I remember playing hours of Animal Crossing for the DS and eventually reaching my saturation point from a lack of adventure and stuff to do. I understand AC has always included the chill vibe but as the Switch iteration dropped I found almost no joy in playing it like I had the past ones. It felt like Nintendo didnt put enough into the game as an emerging title to the collection. Sure there was some barebones construction stuff but, quicker than before, I found myself bored and not in a charmed happy-to-be-a-chill-villager way.

That's rather specific but that is where Dinkum comes in. It's only been a couple of weeks but by myself, and with my partner, I have found my love for this style of game once more. The myriad activities that one does are infused within one another. A day decorating and a day fighting radioactive crocodiles in self-placed mine both have equal place and measure in Dinkum and the lack of pressure from an overarching massive plot (like AC) provide an experience that will make both sweatlords (Think Stardew min/max) and casual gamers alike happy.

So; what can you do?
-You can trap an animal then throw four of his caged animal friends on your Jet Ski and ride around as they await being sent off for research.

-You can have basically Steve Irwin water your pumpkins

-You can fish while your partner can't (Love you! <3)

-You can recycle pants. PANTS!

-You can get a ruby out just before the radioactivity murders your face.

-You can build a building for a bunch of wonderful ingrates that won't hang out with you until you help them with stuff. Though they might teach you how to make a fountain and honestly I don't know what I would be without that fountain. I think about it at night.

-Speaking of night the Late night mechanic that restricts energy but doesn't force you to end a day is legit and I love it.

This game is definitely a ""one-more-day"" game. Definitely a game I recommend for you and your partner(s) to play together. If you don't like AC I think there is more here but there is still a barrier to this game. Pure action seekers probably would be bored but if you like a little crafting, a little building, a little fighting, a little trapping, a little hunting, and a lot of Australian chill vibes.....

However if you WANT to strictly compare it to those two other games; Its way better than animal crossing, and I don't think its fair to either Stardew or Dinkum to say one is better than the other. 

This game has a lot of similarities to the other two, but it has its own very own personality. There are some things I would like to see in the future, but as far as early access games go, this is worth it.  Honestly $20 dollars is a steal and I would happily pay 30-40 for it. 

Prefect game to play with your significant other too.

Also if you think the name is stupid, give it a google, its Australian slang / lingo. Very fitting name when it comes down to it.

Even though the only thing remotely similar between the two is that you can plant and harvest crops in this game, and even THAT kind of gameplay is not similar to Harvest Moon at all (Or Story of Seasons). It's like Eco in terms of graphics and how you can terraform the land, but saying they are similar is like saying cheese looks like butter. They both are yellow and made from the same thing but are used for different purposes.
What I am trying to say here is that Dinkum feels familiar, and at the same time it isn't. It gives you this very simple looking dish, but when you've taken your first bite you realized it is something completely high level and new to your palate. It triggers nostalgia, but it gives you a brand new experience.
If you are into Stardew Valley, well, sorry but Dinkum offers little content at the moment (But is entirely playable and enjoyable at its current state) and if you are into city building or town management games, the smashing of both of these genre of gameplay is something pleasant and very enjoyable indeed. For the farming simulator players out there, go try this one out!

Pros:
Great multiplayer, the only downside is that your friend can't progress the island, but it's not too big of a deal since you're together. Getting money is reasonable and it took me an hour to get to 1 million dinks from 40k. Easy to progress and the mobs are not too difficult to fight. The game is very cute, the mobs look nice, and the overall game play is satisfying. Lots of customisation, though I'd like more urban choices, so I could make the island into a city. 

Cons: Mostly glitches.
Couple of glitches with boats and fishing and rendering, but nothing game breaking. I have been flung halfway across the map with the jetski, lost my rowboat due to uneven water rendering (was able to get it back after re-rendering the map), and had fishes turn into other fishes when they bite. It doesn't happen often and when it does it's just funny. 
John has appeared outside of the shop, and never went inside after 8 AM. He sold you stuff from outside. Fixed after sleeping. 
If you leave crates/furniture inside your tent and upgrade it to a house, they can glitch and get stuck inside.

Game aspects I personally didn't like:
Dying is a little frustrating since you loose your money and your items loose a lot of 'health'.
John has low stock, a little annoying when you're playing with others and you both need to buy something. 
You cannot craft the basic tools, you have to buy them. 
Fishing. 

Overall a solid 7.5/10 for me.

---{Remarks}---
Dinkum is what you get when you take some of the best parts of Animal Crossing New Horizons and Stardew Valley and put them together. It is an early access game, but it feels like a full release, I think. That being said, there are a few typos in some of the dialogue (which is pretty well documented on the Discord for Dinkum). I'd imagine that a majority of the issues will be fixed by the time the game actually is fully released. Additionally, there is a co-op in this game, which I personally haven't tried, but it sounds like it works rather well. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has played either ACNH or Stardew (or both) and enjoyed them.",1672971711,1672971711,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

It's an enjoyabke demo but it's not worth buying at this point.

So this is actually a cross between a harvestcrossing game and Minecraft but in Australia.

Problem a: everything is super-grindy. Buying a house may put you 200k in debt. Selling a bug is 600-800.
One manually cooked meat like 1200. Day pass to the iron mine costs 25k. All you do is selling flowers and shipping animals all day. Crocodile is like 9500 per catch.
There could be an NPC who farms wood or rocks for you but you do all the work, pay for the housing and bring the materials.
Unlocking NPCs is tedious, they show up every few days and then you have to do quests several times.
Optimal would be to make a huge tree farm and boringly optimze the money income.

Problem b: unlike MInecraft this game has stamina and mandatory sleep. Paving your town with stone path is a crazy grind because you farm all that stone with your stamina. Unlike modded MC there's no machine automation at least 20 hours in. You cook single fruits or ingots by placing them manually.

There are also dozens of cosmetic clothing items which do nothing. No bonus and no armor.
Finally you spend a lot of time in the menu because the UI has issues. There's no pause button on the controller. It's hidden in the menu.
FInding a building in the wild that requires items doesn't like list those in your log, you need to screenshot it.
Oh and long walks at least until you finally unlock vehicles (way way out there).",1672969354,1672969354,False,4,0,0.501657426357269287,0,True,False,True

But one thing I will warn you: if you're a player like me who simply can't chill... consider. There will be frustration about some of the mechanics in the game. First let me explain what it means you have to chill with this game: you can't do everything in one day, you simply can't (except I can but it drives me insane) You have to think okay today I will only do fishing, tomorrow I might plant some flowers, the day after is for decorating... because you will struggle to do everything and that's the point of the game. There is NO hurry.

But that's where comes the frustration for players who can't play like that. I have to do a lot in a day. I don't want to stand in front of a grinder all day feeding it stone and wait for each one by one. It's making me insane. I hope this mechanic will be changed because it's absolute torture to craft things like that. I don't understand why can't you just drop like 10 wheat in the mill and get 10 out. What is that ruining? The game will go too fast? No it won't ruin it. I'm begging you, add bulk crafting or at least remove the waiting times like stone goes in, 2 seconds, stone comes out. Please. Maybe make it a license??

Personally in the game I have now reached a point in 57 hours that I have very little less to achieve or do... and it was fun to get here but also extremely annoying too because you get nothing fast. I'm starting to feel like I don't want to play anymore (yes it's my own fault for getting things fast) I love the game to death and will be glad to see more content added but I don't know if I would have bought it knowing it's mechanics.

But yeah. It's cute, it's fun, there's a lot to do to a point (but updated seem to be coming regularly)... overall depending on the person I absolutely will recommend this game.",1672952508,1672952508,True,2,0,0.544827640056610107,0,True,False,True

It's very similar to animal crossing and I couldn't really find many ways where this game makes itself unique. That could of course be just because I haven't played enough. I will however not be playing anymore because there are a couple things that bugged the hell out of me.

First of all, it only saves the game when you sleep. And although I know for some games this is a perfectly sensible game-mechanic, in this game to me at least it just feels kinda annoying and restrictive.
The game gets repetitive and boring really fast. Want to make copper bars? Throw some ores in the furnace. Oh no wait, can only make 1 bar at the time. The same goes for making planks. So need to make 10 of them? Yeah be prepared, we'll be here a while, just waiting and throwing in logs in the saw machine. 1... at... a... time... YAWN.

And then there's the thing that convinced me to immediately close this game and not ever give it a try again. The fishing. Yes, you read that right, the fishing, which according to google is just easy peasy, managed to chase me away 100%. For those who think, oh I've played dozens of farming games, I'm sure it's nothing new. Yeah well, it is... Or rather, it's not intuitive. After trying a couple times, looking all over the screen for some kind of bar and just not figuring out what to do, I googled it. And turns out, when a fish bites (and it can either nibble or bite) you immediately click. If you click a second later, too bad, fish is gone.
So you click and then the fish will do it's absolute best to swim away. You have to wait. Once it calms down, you can reel it in. Until it starts trashing again. Then you let it go. Until it's calm, and then reel it in again.

Made sense, so I thought, how hard can it be right? Well as it turns out, VERY hard. Because the game isn't really giving you a lot of indicators. So you're stuck watching that fish and as soon as it turns around, let go of the mouse again and watch it swim away. That's not the worst part though. No, the worst part is where the fish just breaks loose without you even doing anything. Or, where you reel it in but doubt you can get it fully in before it has a temper tantrum again so you let go of the mouse to let it swim away for a bit only the game sees this as 'oh oops, too late, should've tried harder' aaaand now it's gone again.

I really do not have time for this kind of ridiculous gameplay. If I wanted something challenging and impossible and boring I probably could've found some game less expensive. I have no clue why all reviews are so ridiculously positive. Normally I love this genre, but this game really doesn't do anything for me.",1672890811,1672890811,False,4,0,0.499482512474060059,0,True,False,True

It forces you into having repeated interactions just to accomplish what should be done in one go. For example, you can only sell one item at the store at a time, at which point the menu closes and you have to restart the whole process with the NPC. Even with crafting stations, the early ones I got required repeated use for every single item produced rather than being able to stock materials and go on your merry way as they're processing. I'm not expecting factory-level efficiency here, but this is super tedious busywork for not much reward. A lot of the menus in this game and just the way it plays make me think of a cheap mobile or Nintendo game. 

And a word of warning for people seeking to play coop exclusively - you won't be able to from the start until you create a character and play for a few minutes (15 or so?) on your own, figuring out the ropes. The main quest seems to not be shared with the person joining your world, which means that there's at least a certain amount of time they'll have to spend doing stuff in their own world. All in all, pretty annoying, especially if you're just looking to try it out and see if you and your friend both like it.

I will say it's a very simple and forgiving game if you want to play it with a child or a gaming-impaired adult.",1672855927,1672856089,False,5,2,0.436993509531021118,0,True,False,True

Room for Improvement - this section is mostly feedback for the creators:
- A bit short, but hey, it's still early access, and there's a lot of content already considering that. But there isn't really any sort of endgame. There isn't much to do in the mines (beyond looking for chests / red crystals) and the whole map is unlocked from the very start, so there's not really a sense of ""unlocking more things to do"" as you progress. The game could benefit from more mine levels or more dangerous biomes that you can't survive without better tools and equipment.
- Farming progression feels a bit off. I was almost level 12 in mining and had unlocked the deep mine before I planted any crops at  all. The reason being that keeping your crops safe from birds requires a scarecrow, but crafting a scarecrow requires a watermelon or pumpkin, both of which you can only get by planting them yourself and letting them grow for several days. I hovered near my watermelon seeds for the better part of the summer season, which was quite boring to be honest, only to have them all snatched up by a bird the one time I quickly ducked into the trader or tried to do my other daily tasks. In the end the only reason I managed to progress farming at all was because I was able to buy a scarecrow off the Christmas special vendor. I think scarecrows should be easier to make, or at least add a temporary one that requires daily repairs or something.
- Animal husbandry also progresses a bit weirdly. I had the third license very quickly and was technically allowed to raise a whole number of animals, but Irwin only seems to sell chickens in his temporary store, so I was never able to actually purchase the others. I built a bunch of empty pens for them.
- Getting merchants to apply for a permanent residence takes a bit too long in my opinion. I think friendship gain per quest should be adjusted, or we should be given the option to do multiple quests for them when they visit. I very quickly got to a point where I had exhausted most of the other daily content (was stuck on farming as mentioned above, and didn't need any more cash or resources). It's not exactly fun to do one quest for a visitor, then skip any days without that visitor by going back to sleep immediately until they show up again. If there's a different way to speed up this process, then it's not well explained. I did also always chat with the merchants and spent quite a bit of cash at their temporary stores. Except for Irwin, because once you buy 2 birds, 1 feeder and can make your own feed from seeds, there's no _reason_ to spend any cash at his store.
- The bats in the mine are annoying. They're really hard to hit with any of the weapons and they drop almost nothing. It's more efficient to just ignore them and just madly dash around the mine looking for crystals with a huge cloud of bats and other critters trailing behind, not sure that's the intended mechanic.
- Animal spawns seem broken (maybe just in multiplayer, not sure). But generally we noticed the world quickly depopulating with hardly any animals or bugs left, only to return to normal when we quit and relaunched the game. It's easily fixed that way, but a bit annoying.",1672777596,1672777596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

See I've always been the kinda person who REALLY wanted to like animal crossing, but the restrictive real time clock infuriated me to no end and I was too scared of messing up my devices to time travel. However, I've always wanted that kind of experience, but with a game that wasn't so anal retentive about time.

Now, this game has room for improvement - there does need to be some things added, and I would appreciate some villagers who weren't there just to be shop keeps as well - but I can say that everything GOOD about it shines through. 

The game's super forgiving with your items if you happen to die (Like me), the only draw back being a minus to your tool's health but you know what? I'll take a half broken shovel over loosing the butterfly that got me mauled by crocodiles. I do agree that the mines are a bit difficult, but again, any real complaints I have are either slated to be fixed or so minor that they do not bother me. (Except maybe the aggro on crocodiles I think they should calm down a little)

The music is wonderfully infectious, the setting is never bland, and even though characters tend to repeat each other, they're different enough to keep things lively and fun. 

A minor suggestion is that I think the machine manual should be a free gift from John or Fletch once you start the crafting side of things, because lord knows how long it took me to figure out that you can make tin plates by running them through the table saw. Other than that, the game does a wonderful job at mixing what it tells you vs what it lets you find out, the art style is adorable and I cannot wait to see where this developer goes with Dinkum - and I'll be there to see it!",1672767618,1672767618,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Just for the reference the farming/life sim games I liked are Animal Crossing New Horizons and Disney Dreamlight valley 

Pros

- Chicks are cute and you can pet them 
- Interface is well thought 
- Generous inventory size from the beginning 
- Controls are shown every time you are in front of an object so there‚Äôs no forgetting how to pick things up or use instruments 
- All map areas are accessible from the start

Cons

- Extremely grindy, hard to get money. I was constantly in debt without any feasible way to pay it out. 
- Characters are shallow and befriending them gives nothing. Their requests are boring: blue moon butterflies and flies - it‚Äôs all you need 
- Deep mines are annoying and enemies are attacking every second. My god I hated it. Locked areas have chests with useless items. So anticlimactic to get a couple of used slingshots locked behind two doors. But copper ore is scarce so I had to go to the mines so I found a mod online to disable the enemies to be able to continue playing this game 
- Some mechanics seem too time consuming on purpose to keep you in the game. No auto feeder for animals and basic watering can covers one tile wtf
- Killing kangaroos and turkeys was sad since they are cute and try to run away. I am not a fan of killing animals in a cozy game 
- There‚Äôs no story in this game 
- Why the heck can‚Äôt I use items from my storage boxes directly when crafting? 
- Why the heck fishing is so tedious? 
- Why do crops grow so slowly? 
- Why are all machines so expensive?
- Why there‚Äôs no pause in the game and save only at the end of the day? 
 
I played it enough to say that it got boring pretty fast and I didn‚Äôt even get to the good part with all quality of life improvements, but I stopped enjoying watering one tile at a time and doing same thing over and over again to earn some money just to add another store I already gathered ingredients for. 200k for a fucking store wtf",1672749557,1672749557,False,6,4,0.425706684589385986,0,True,False,True

This game is seriously well thought out with so much to do. 
Of course in the Early Access state there's still room for improvement.

[b] The story [/b] is pretty typical for the genre. After getting fed up with the grey boring city livin' you're given the opportunity to move out to greener pasture. A nice old lady with a blimp takes you to her old hometown island [i] (basically Australia). [/i] You get to customize your character a bit, pick a name for yourself and the new town and off you go. 

[b] Not much hand-holding. [/b] You get a nice short and sweet tutorial and some of the basics and then your free to blaze your own trail. The [u] core gameplay loop [/u] consists of making enough money to build new buildings to invite permanent residents. How you get to that goal is up to you. Logging, Fishing, Hunting, Mining, Farming, Trapping, Scavenging, Foraging, and more. So many occupational options. I haven't found which is the most profitable yet, but Fishing and Hunting are so far the most fun to me.

[b] Be prepared to grind. [/b] Income is slow to start out. Be ready to spend the first couple weeks (in game) doing tasks to get new licenses to unlock all the activities. Slowly growing relationships with Granny and John as well as the newcomers to the town to try and convince them to stay. It takes a while, but the journey there is fun. I don't know how in depth the relationship system goes as I haven't seen many fruits from that labor, but I am eager to see how it plays out.

[b] Design the town, and your house [/b] however you like. [i] (As far as money and resources permit) [/i] You can place whatever building you want, anywhere you want on level ground. Want a grid layout city? Go for it. Rather have it feel like a hobbit villiage? No problem. With lots of decorations, pathways, and such make your town how you please. This is another one of my favorite features, but I haven't gotten too deep into designing my town as of yet because I'm shooting for efficiency. I was slightly displeased when I found out it takes a good bit of coin to move buildings after they've been placed, so think a little before plopping down buildings.

[h1] Pro+ Con- [/h1]
+ Lots to do
+ Good Audio design and Music
+ Fishing is more than just a mini-game
+ Island is a good size. Not so big that it feels empty, but not so small that you feel cramped.
+ Vehicles
+ Lots of NPC's to interact with and get to know.

- Very Grindy
- I'm not a huge fan of the Animal-Crossing / Minecraft - Esk artstyle personally, but it fits the theme. [i] this is just my opintion [/i]
- Tools break extremely quick early game which adds to the grindyness because you have to buy tools in the beginning. This is less of a problem the farther you get.
- Terra-forming is a pain the rear. The shovel can only move 1 dirt tile at a time so when deciding where you want to build make sure it's already fairly flat.

[i] Suggestions [/i]
~ Maybe a vehicle that lets you terraform better?
~ More enemy types, maybe certain ones that only come out at night to make the game feel more dangerous? I'm not sure how ""grounded"" the game is suppose to be, but cryptids could definitely be a thing. Skinwalkers, Jackalopes, Zombies, Etc would be neat to fight.
~ Fishing could be more in depth, bait types, fighting the fish by pulling Left or Right depending on how the fish swims away, currently the fish swims directly away from you.
~ Character customization could be more in depth
~ Seeing a preview of the article of clothing in the inventory would be nice
~ Expand the museum to have a spot for rare artifacts found in the mines or other places. I'm thinking like a Dinosaur skeleton that you have to reconstruct piece by piece.

Anyways, overall I really enjoy the game, and would recommend it to anyone who is even remotely a fan of the genre.

The moment the fish swims out of reach, doesn't matter if you follow the rules, you dont catch it. It is super flawed, it looks like they tried combining ac fishing with a different mechanic, but all it did was create rage.
Anyway, aside from my huge frustration to the fishing, its great, Animal crossing meets my time at portia, stardew valley, plus better multiplayer and has other cool stuff like hunting and actual hostile mobs. But until they nerf the fishing, im not recommending it, because if you can't even catch a fish 1/5 of the time you will never complete the museum.

Edit: OKAY, so i am an idiot. To fish, you let it swim away when its splashing, then reel it in when it stops, HOWEVER, you need to click, not hold down, if you click repetitively instead, it doesn't affect the rod stamina.",1672533783,1672611314,True,0,0,0.386843204498291016,0,True,False,True

I see it as a mix of Animal Crossing and Minecraft (definitely the blocky style and music give me Minecraft vibes). I've heard that it's also got aspects of Stardew Valley in it too, but I haven't played it so I can't say myself. And hearing that this was made by a singular person too just blows my mind!

I love how they took all the quality of life aspects that Animal Crossing was lacking and implemented them here. Going in and out of buildings doesn't result in a transition, long loading screen and another transition. It's instantaneous. There's an icon on the ground indicating where you're facing and what tiles on the ground would be effected if you're, say, digging or placing an item. That's something I absolutely wished Animal Crossing had. Just everything seems faster and more intuitive in this game whereas Animal Crossing felt so unnecessarily slow and bogged down by the UI and game mechanics.

There are a lot of features that differentiate this from Animal Crossing though to make this more unique, but I don't want to give them away (and I'm also finding out more as I go along too!).

One of those games where you look up at the clock and realize you've been playing for 5 hours. Some of the mechanics take a little bit of figuring out, and TBH I was fortunate to have my kids, both of whom are vets at this type of game (they have dozens of hours into Animal Crossing) to help me out. 

The multiplayer aspect of the game was pretty seamless to get into as well. We were all 3 able to join each others games with little problem. 

There were a few minor glitches: one happened when we were all 3 in my son's instance of the game. My daughter decided to mess w/him by taking his row boat all the way out to sea and then quitting the game. This resulted in the rowboat staying all the way out in the ocean so they had to create another one to go out and get it once she signed back in again.

The second was inexplicable: somehow her character appeared to be swimming on dry land. No matter where we went on land she ""swam"" there! we discovered that this was only on my screen - on both of the other screens she was walking as normal. It was pretty funny though.

I stopped playing tho because I feel it got too grindy. Like the iron bars needed to make any useful tool is just a lot and to mine iron ore you have to spend time in the Deep Mine which is also a lot of money needed to get to that point (plus a Mine Pass for every time). 

A lot of this game boils down to, I choose X as project, and for X I need to do A. But to do A first, I need materials for A. To find materials for A I also need money, and since I'm low in money I have to ditch all my stuff prior and earn some money first. And the day goes by fast and with stamina you keep refilling your stamina bar, but you need to have farmed a decent amount of fruits (and cook them) to have those items ready. And at the end of the day your stamina is 1/10th because of sleep deprivation so you can't even work more, you're forced to sleep and start the next day.

And with the next day, comes a new task. Pet the animals, feed the animals, collect resources from animals. Then you have your small farm (because to get automated sprinklers, you need A LOT of farming XP, and farming only gets you XP once you harvest every 6-7 days..) for the small farm you need to water everything as well. Then there's micro-management with the residents.

In short, there is a million little tasks to do, and everytime I try to tackle one project at a time, I'm ALWAYS forced to ditch the project for awhile and spend time on collecting/farming something required.

I really enjoyed the game and for the price is well worth it, it's early Access but honestly it feels and plays like a finished game. Sure there are tweaks that can be done/added, but never had a bug. 

Just be aware that you it requires a lot of time and grinding, so if you're low on time every week, you might not enjoy it as much because the progress will feel a lot slower. I'm glad I played this during a Xmas break so abundance of time there, but like Animal Crossing on Nintendo consoles, it's to be played in short bursts, but to get to the cool stuff (the big farms, automated sprinklers, vehicles, automated tools like jackhammer/dirt landscaper) you'll be grinding soooo much. 

Iron Ore is  by far the most annoying resource to farm as there are little in the overworld so you're forced in the Deep Mines, and without a Jackhammer to quickly drill ores (whilst avoiding being attacked by bats every turn) you'll be busy for a long time manually pickaxing iron ores.. I spent about 10 hours just to get the jackhammer materials so I could do an easy run of the Deep Mines, but after completing it, I'm like okay I still need a gazillion Iron Ore just to get some decent farming ready to have automated sprinklers so I don't have to manually water plants every damn day.

A suggestion for the devs: please increase the spawn rate of Iron Ores in the overworld, or make the Iron Bar quantity requirements lower because I shouldn't have to spend close to 50 hours in the game just to get to the cool stuff I wanted to do once I saw the first youtube video on this game..",1672491609,1672491609,True,8,0,0.612121224403381348,0,True,False,True

Dinkum is what I would call the perfect alternative to Animal Crossing. However whilst not quite a clone of the the top tier Nintendo title, Dinkum certainly sets itself apart and stand on it's on two feet. The best I can describe this game would be using a the Family Guy meme of the two guys crashing and accidentally inventing peanut butter and chocolate. Except in this the meme would be Animal 'Crossing-over' with Stardew Valley albeit set in Australia. This is a welcome setting for myself as an Australian, it isn't very common a game will use Aus as it's worldly inspiration. 

Dinkum is fun, relaxing and addicting and I could not imagine just how good this game must be on the Steam Deck. (I cannot wait for the device to launch in Australia for this game alone now.)

Dinkum can be enjoyed with friends in a fully co-op world where you can work together to build and survive. This is a very welcome addition to the game and I wouldn't fault the game without this at all.

All said, this is the perfect game to pick up if you're a fan of Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley and I am absolutely going to sneak this in to my top 5 games of 2022, perhaps top 3. 

The story behind the creation alone reminds me of Eric Berone's story of Stardew Valley and I cannot wait to see how far this game could possibly go with more marketing, console releases, mobile ports and expanding features. 

All this, and it's in early access as of the time of writing this.

Something that scratches that itch for a game that has a combination of sandbox-like and harvest moon/stardew mechanics. The fact that it tosses animal crossing-like features into it is also a major plus!

My fiance got the game shortly after I did and we've been playing side by side as it seems co-op is more akin to animal crossing's multiplayer at the moment. We did try it to see how well it would work for us and made new characters specifically for a co-op. Sadly, as he was the host, I was barred from the story stuff, thus I would never get certain recipes, such as nails or a crate. Sure, he could make them for me and I could gather the resources for such.. but it kinda defeats the purpose of us being able to fully work together. While we were a tad disappointed, we decided to hold off on co-op to see where the dev takes it later on. For now, we just get jealous over what recipes we each get that the other doesn't have, or neat clothing haha.

The game does seem to get a little buggy the longer we play, sometimes forcing us to close the game after a save and relaunch. So far, the most annoying bug is dealing with getting pictures for an NPC via the request board. After playing for a while, if I pick up one of those quests, it will not register on the quest that I've gotten a picture of what the NPC wants. No matter how many I take, what angle it's in, or time of day.. just wouldn't work. But, after reloading the game, it worked fine.

Another is where animals just start to vanish, or move further and further away from your town. Making hunting or capturing a lot more difficult. (Edit: After I made this review, I did find out you can damage the more hostile critters before capturing them. They won't escape then.) I don't know if that is intentional or a bug though.

All in all, it's a great game! I don't normally write reviews, but felt compelled to do so for this one.

Now for the game itself. At its core Dinkum is Animal Crossing with the time passing added from regular farming games. A day will net you about half an hour IRL, give or take depending on how much you pause ofc. Multiplayer is sadly also exactly like Animal Crossing, so you can only visit someone else's island. However from what I've experienced so far there's a LOT you can do on another's island, so it might be worth it to just keep on visiting the one island and work on it together.

But Dinkum is more than Animal Crossing. Every character you add to the town brings with them another feature. You don't just get a new villager, you get a hairdresser, a scientist, a well-known Australian crocodile enthusiast. The villagers have daily requests of you that you can complete to become friendly with them, and getting friendly with them will bring you new goodies and blueprints. They also interact with the town a lot more than AC villagers do, like watering your crops and petting your animals to keep them happy. Sadly the fixed villagers also means that you don't have hundreds of villagers to randomly get to your island; you just get the same few others get as well. You do however have the option to build more empty houses, so maybe that will change at a later date.

What Dinkum lacks in variety of villagers, it makes up in variety of building options. The shops the villagers bring to your island are very diverse, and they look really nice together. There's a ton of different fence, floor, and decoration options, with some of the decorations automatically locking into fences which look just SO good. To craft these you often need multiple working stations, which requires farming multiple resources like different trees, ores, plants, and leftover mechanical devices like CDs and keyboards. So that's what you'll spend most of your time doing. Gathering resources, crafting stuff, selling valuables, and building your town.

There's also combat (hunting), and sometimes you'll be requested to take out an alpha creature which has some raid mechanics. It feels smooth, but it's definitely not the main part of the game.

Creating a town from scratch is fun, but in some games the gameplay turns out to be boring, but Dinkum keeps it fresh with a great artstyle and tons to do every day. Another issue I had with Stardew Valley was the overwhelming amount of stuff that is all thrown at you at once, but this game lays out everything in a more comprehensible way. That's not to say it's a perfect game, and it could use quite a few more features before the game officially releases. Some new biomes and foliage could be interesting, as well as some more animals to give insentive to explore more. I also feel like backpacks would be great if they continue to add many more items (although I'm not far enough in to know if they have already).

Started a new save and haven't had any crashing yet. Haven't tried to pull up the old broken save, since I'm just continuing with the new save. Xmas event is fun and the decorations are cute. Seems like it's more stable now than earlier. Lots to do & a fun game. I'll recommend it now, but keep up my old review below to emphasize it's still early access.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the first 24 hours I played it was a JOY. It was so much fun and there was always a ton to do. I couldn't wait to play more and get into the meat of the game with raising animals and going to the mines and building out the town.

Just one problem. Now, it will freeze and stop responding after a few minutes of play. Sometimes by moving the camera, sometimes moving items into storage or around my inventory, sometimes when I'm doing nothing at all. There's no consistency in what i'm doing but it will always crash before i can do much at all. 

I've tried everything to get it to work from reinstalling, updating my BIOS + drivers, virus and malware scans, repairing windows libraries, lowering graphics settings, using local saves instead of cloud saves, sleeping immediately to see if it was an issue with that particular day in-game. Nothing works. My computer has an intel 10th generation i7 2.6ghz, 16gb ram & a RTX 2060 so specs shouldn't be an issue at all.

The game has AMAZING potential and loved playing it, but now it's unplayable for me. Recommend if it'll work for you - I know a lot of people who haven't has issues - but if you're one of the unlucky ones that get this crashing, I can't recommend. Based on my game experience alone, I'll have to not recommend and wait until the next update to see if it fixes the crashing issue.",1662601922,1671826156,True,0,0,0.486755996942520142,0,True,False,True

If you're into the cozy game genre at all, you're sure to love this game as well.
Some of the best parts of Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, and a hint of Minecraft (mostly the semi blocky terrain) are present in this game, with a few improvements. This fits neatly into the same genre without feeling like a knock-off.
The areas of advancement can be exhausted relatively quickly, which is not to say they're easy, just that you'll run out of things to achieve after putting in enough play time. That said, I get the impression that the developers have far more in store (because early access) and offer regular updates. As I write this, I'm enjoying some extra items and quests from a winter holiday update. 

Even if you grind morning till night, and obtain all the furniture, clothes, and advancements the game has to offer, there are mods available to keep it interesting even if another update never drops (which I doubt). Still, I'm optimistic to see what else the devs have in store as time goes on. Sale, or full price, you'll get your money's worth out of this game, and then some.

So if you're a cozy game enthusiast, you're missing out if you don't own this game. I look forward to seeing the community that is already developing around this game.

It's a huge game that will take a lot of your time, and honestly feels so good to play, it's almost as if it's a sequel to Animal Crossing.  It's well done, but it's not quite enough to make me think it's flat out better than any of the aforementioned games.  I still would love to play those others, and they have their advantages over this, but Dinkum is like a combined package.  This is great because with updates, this game can continue to evolve.  

I will say, I wish you could have the option to create the lowest level of tools.  It seems you have to purchase them, and it's a big inconvenience when your store is limited to one per day.  Also, ores above ground seem to be limited?  I'd love to keep mining but I feel like I'm forced to go underground at this point.",1671403123,1671403123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Not for the story or the money but the seemingly endless progression in the game. It is a very basic game on the surface and I thought I had explored everything. Yet to my narrow world view, there was still so much left to do. Franklin's Lab is a whole part of the game in itself, and that's only one of the many NPCs you can convince to settle on your own island. Each time I open this game I am hooked into multi-hour sessions without noticing. I'll open the game after dinner and oops! Its already 2 am. If you like RPG games with an exploration factor with a creative twist, this is the game for you!

In a nutshell, this game is animal crossing in Australia with similar mechanics to stardew valley and has a Terraria-like vibe.

I wonder why people speak about it as a SUPER COOL GAME! A REVOLUTION!
Did you play it? I did it for 7 hours!
What you see in the video is the bottleneck of this game. It does not give you anything more.
I just wanted to let you know that you don't need to do anything here. Everything you do needs to make sense. 
This game has enough content, but every step is unfinished YET.
I can not recommend this at that stage.
What is going on wrong here:
1) Mobs are not challenging. You can kill anyone with 1 lvl weapon. You can hunt, but for what? You don't need it.
2) Your goal is to GRIND MONEY.
3) Farming looks annoying, basically you need money for it to get money and spend enough time to finally earn something.
4) Fishing is weird.
5) Not enough guides.
6) This game does not have a difficulty changer. This is literally for NON-players to ... play?",1670177107,1671291522,False,3,0,0.399038255214691162,0,True,False,True

I've played stardew and minecraft, yet I lost interest but they were still good games though , don't get me wrong. I've only ever stucked with animal crossing but then got bored with it. Dinkum really is all three (stardew, minecraft, and acnh) in one but with a twist. There so many things to do and awesome NPC's that make the game more enjoyable. The map is amazingly large so there is a vast amount of exploring to do! I thought I would only play for an hour when I got the game but there are so many things to do plus lots of tools/items/tasks that could hook you in depending on what part of the game interests you the most- whether it's mining, farming, or something else. Hope you enjoy the game as much as the rest of us who loves it! The developer has outdone himself with Dinkum..

edit: ive been able to play now without any game breaking bugs for a while and now have 4 permanent residents. now that i can actually play its more enjoyable. its animal crossing with less charm but more features like farming and a mincraft like terrain manipulation. the deep mine is underwhelming and seems to just be a place for some extra mining and for hunting xp. itd be nice to see more differences to the envrionment for each season, i get that its austrilia but its also a game. some more variety would make the seasons feel like they matter more than just for the farming and fishing time gates. 

for me this is just a nostolgia trip for replaying animal crossing without having to go back to console after switching to pc. the characters are boring and the animal crossing gibbersish doent fit right in this compared to animals. seems to be focused on diverse(cough gotta rep all skin colors cause focusing on skin color is meta these days cough) characters instead of designing charming or fun characters. theres not as many fish, bugs or fruit trees as animal crossing yet. the digging up of ""treasure"" is now mostly junk instead of fun stuff for your house or the meusem like in animal crossing now its just junk to sell. it is fun making new rivers by changing the terrain however due to how the shovel and wheelbarrow work it takes insanely long and unless you want a new skyscraper of dirt next to where your building the you have to carry the dirt one scoop at a time or fill up a glitchy wheelbarrow then push the wheelbarrow to a spot to start replacing the dirt one scoop at a time. 

so if you like animal crossing and these changes plus a stamina/feed bag bar are fine with you then go for it. im switiching my review to reccomended because the dev is still making changes but this is defintly in alpha or beta state, otherwise this is a 5-10$ game that still needs work. hopefully this keeps getting content and adds fun characters and events or things like a clubhouse with diggiredoo music as well as makes the multiplayer better with options to create a coop shared world or letting friends temporarly join others worlds and keep any dinks or exp they gain there.


unplayable
money keeps getting capped at 777 coins making purchases impossible
started 3 fresh saves only to have each one lock my money cap at 777
cant progress the town and wont even let me harvest the hardwood it wants me too

this should be a free game till it actually works

remember when game devs where confident enough in the product that we could play free demos to see if we like it? now we have only 2 hours to find out if a game actually works or is as advertised if we need to get a refund for a faulty or misadvertised product.

Dinkum is a lovely experience that I found far less intimidating than Stardew Valley, and it has much the same character as Animal Crossing (minus, of course, the animal villagers). It addresses the biggest problem I had with ACNL when I played it: Dinkum is not tied to the real-world clock. The Australian setting is novel and shines through various aspects of the game: not just the environments, but the writing and overall 'culture' of the game as well. It has made me curious about a continent that I regrettably haven't had much time to learn about.

In games that offer it, I dislike farming as a system. In Dinkum, as in many other games, it is slow (and your growth in the associated skill is tied to harvests). But it's not something you have to do to make money. You can catch bugs, fish, hunt and trap animals, or beachcomb for shells and discarded technology via metal detector (the latter is a great source of money and my favorite thing to do.

While there isn't a design tool for custom clothing or patterns, I have seen a lot of really cool options so far. I was and am excited to continue building up my house and slowly adding villagers. The graphics initially weren't my cup of tea but they have grown on me, and now I can't walk past a Diggo without internally aww-ing. They really are too cute to kill... crocodiles on the other hand can keep handing their meat over.

At the end of my major stint in Dinkum I was about to unlock the mines, and I hear that they're pretty challenging and that there's potential for grind there, so I'll probably have to pace myself as I build up a nest egg of Dinks and begin shifting focus to customization/island planning. But this is not something I view with trepidation. I recently spent about 12 hours in Kynseed, another recent life sim, and didn't enjoy it very much, yet that experience prompted me to write this review. Dinkum is 'simple' in some respects, yes, and it takes after Animal Crossing for the basic loop, but I almost got through my first year in a day. This is a game that it's easy to get lost in, and fun to spend time in.

My Switch Lite is buried in moving boxes, and while there are things I miss about ACNL, I vastly prefer Dinkum not only because it's on PC, but because of its character. The sole dev has put a lot of heart into it and it shows. Dinkum is a homely, welcoming place despite the outback's repute for dangerous wildlife (and believe me, those Wary Mu ARE dangerous...). If you turn down a villager's daily request, they don't berate or penalize you. It sounds silly, but was actually mildly therapeutic for me.

Looking forward to seeing what's to come in the future of this game.

TL;DR

Buy this game if:

--You wish there was an Animal Crossing game that didn't run in realtime
--You have a soft spot for the Australian outback, or are curious about it
--You thought Stardew Valley was good/great but wish it was more focused with less of a farming emphasis
--Or, you like the general type of game Stardew is but prefer them in 3D rather than 2D

Don't buy this game if:

--You would rather wait for full release
--The idea or concept of something like Animal Crossing doesn't sound entertaining to you
--You are dead set on multiplayer (it exists, but I've heard it needs to be fleshed out a bit more.)

It's worth the asking price and will give you many hours of fun, satisfaction and relaxation if you're a fan of the genre. If you're newer to it, like me, Dinkum is an excellent starting point.",1670571352,1670571352,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. Facing and targeting: The tile cursor-like approach to designating the direction of an action of its intended location is very, very imprecise, laggy and very often requires several attempts to get the right facing or messing around with trying to look at a tile form several angles before getting the cursor to lock on correctly.  In the mni boss-like fights in the game, this is a massive nuisance, and a deep pain point in the mines where you need to (try) and perform hit and run attacks and dodges. Too often you'll just entirely miss because the cursor hasn't 'caught up' yet.
2. Heading change lag: Self explanatory. 
3. Unpredictable resource scarcity. I'm not sure what kind of resource respanwing logic this game uses, but I've scoured the map some weeks without a node of a certain resource to be found anywhere.

Personal Score (9/10)

Pro Aspects:

+ Terraform with your own resources and map the town/orchard/farm yourself by placing buildings that towny NPCs you invited can live in.
+ 3rd Person character play of an arguably Open-world of hunting(via combat)/fishing/logging/mining/bug-catching
(the instance changes between worlds are only gradual that don't feel noticeable)
+ Seasons/Time of the day dependent spawns that randomize every day in-game
+ Complete assignments(whether daily or with a set due date) requested by your townies
+ Active Discord community
+ Lots of clothing options even now (at least 120+ items) that can be earned in the game
+ Updates planned for the EA phase (as of posting this now)

Neutral Aspects:
* Slow Dialogue Speed set at default that can be manually enhanced in the settings to make the game much more playable.
* Slower in-game speed of time (compared to Stardew VAlley for example). I am at around 48hour real-time mark but still haven't gotten around 1 year mark in-game yet. This also means that more can be done in one day.

Less appealing aspects in the EA phase:
- Shallow dialogues (many interactions between all the NPCs speak in the same cookie-cutter set phrases or are simply interrupted by a *Text* blurp)

The game feels highly replayable even at this stage, although less so as the number of new kinds of collectibles slowly diminish. The terraforming aspect provided in the base game definitely gives more freedom, something that might feel more pronounced coming from other farming titles with non-redisignable towns, which might've always felt more restricting.

The next goal is always near, it doesn't feel like endless grinding but still I am waaaay to go with over 50 hours of gameplay. And I am a power player hunting for efficiency. You can take the game slow and enjoy every day or try to achieve all optional goals per day to optimize your time. Sometimes I forcefully slow down and just enjoy my newly built farm or roads and bridges and don't go money hunting, otherwise the game can really tire you out if you try to maximize your output every day. You don't need to :)

The similarities to Animal Crossing are of course pretty obvious. This game copied so much from AC, it basically is a PC clone for it. However it adds much more options to the game and removed much really annoying grind features (as well as unskippable animations on crafting/catching bugs etc.). Dinkum improved alot of lacking features in AC - I would go so far to call it an evolved Animal Crossing 2.0, without the overexpensive Nintendo license of course.

Given that this game is classified early access, I don't feel any of this. I've never run into a bug or glitch, the game runs smooth as pie, the graphics look nice and well designed. Of course some sounds and music could or should be added, but AC as a final product doesn't offer much more as Dinkum.

The only downside is that the Multiplayer feature is - unfortunetaly - also a copied version from Animal Crossing. You can't build together or run an island together. You have your own island and friends can basically just visit you and don't do much there. When I was looking with my girlfriend for a game we can play together, we saw the reviews regarding the so-called ""Multiplayer"" and almost didn't buy the game. Now we're both playing on our own island while sitting next to each other and simply both enjoy the game being played as Singleplayer.

When we checked the player stats on steam charts I was alarmed when seeing the low player count of Dinkum, but I can assure anyone out there, that this game is worth every cent times 10.",1670164177,1670164177,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

+ Approachable
+ Diverse activities
+ Cute
+ Big potential for further development
Cons:
- Lack of goal
- Weird balancing

I'd give 50% (and mind it's EA, so it may tremendously improve yet!), considering there's a lot of positive reviews, allow me to explain my problem with the game. At the moment, it's a big sandbox where I can expand, but I lack incentive to. These games are usually driven forward by something to reach. Now if I get a copper bar, I can improve my axe and get that hardwood so I can build...

The gameplay is at the moment oddly unrewarding. I have a small camp and I can gather stuff to sell and buy a new building that will sell me something... I don't have much use for. The buildings are unlocked with money - a lot of money, so everything you sell yields a lot, making the basic items comparatively cheap. Making money is thus more of a chore with very little reward. Crafting recipes unlock rather randomly and most of them are decorative. A lot of what I can build was never built, because it just didn't serve any purpose.

There's very little story. Very little incentive to explore. If you enjoy sandbox play with no goal, go for it, you're going to have fun, but if want something to aim for and try to achieve, wait till the game is developed further. After some six hours, you're gonna get bored and a chance to catch a new butterfly when walking further from your base won't help. I think it might be a good game for kids, but don't expect Stardew Valley, at least not yet.

Also, pet peeve - developers please, stop producing super excited dialog lines of ""Oh thank you, you're helping me so much, I don't know what I'd do without you!"" after we walk five steps and pitch a tent ;)",1669999460,1669999460,False,2,1,0.457048118114471436,0,True,False,True

When I purchased this, I wasn't expecting much but a love letter to Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing. However, for an Early Access game, it offers quite a bit of content. I can't recommend it more for $20. 

There are plenty of activities (a la Animal Crossing) to gather and raise money. Then you have a bunch of others (a la Stardew) to create long-term money makers, such as farming and animal husbandry. Plenty of crafting and decorating options, as well as ways to customize your entire island, including buildings and decor. 

The best feature is the multiplayer, where you can team up to help each other actually customize your islands. I remember being disappointed in AC:NH when I could not help my friends decorate or terraform. No worries - we can truly co-op in Dinkum!

Lifestyle, wildlife, culture. Dinkum encapsulates the quintessence of the wild Australian outback, refining it into a relaxing, yet engaging simulation experience.

Despite being an 'Early Access Game', Dinkum has already solidified itself as one the greatest farming simulator games, alongside the likes of fan favourites, Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley.

Dinkum perfectly blends the stereotypical farming/life sim-esque elements of gathering, farming and crafting, topped with a touch of survival. From scavenging for carcinogenic trash to pay off insane debts to joyriding on emus and fending off glow-in-the-dark fungi crocs, Dinkum is plentiful in content, enough to satiate the desires of any life sim genre diehard.

However, with the good, comes the not so good.

For those who enjoy the 'co-op' experience, the game in its current state may not provide you the full package. Dinkum currently does not have shared progression i.e. the opportunity to complete the same quests and the ability to unlock items/buildings. Simply put, friends of the host are limited to only helping the host progress, unable to benefit themselves. Hopefully this is a feature that can, and will be refined/altered in future updates.

With that being said, I can't wait to see which direction the developer chooses to progress from here, but from what we've seen so far, it's bound to be great. Happy Dinkum gamers!

I will list out my reasons, but the major reason is, I notice a lot of small issues and is honestly mostly related to game being EA and runned by 1 person. If game is on sale, 100% worth

Bonus-
got when it was on sale

Pros-
you get to build a town from the ground up
there are a LOT of un-lockable clothing and furniture (with some memy ones that made me laugh)
game is easy to run
the many different things you can collect

cons (mostly from this game being EA)- 
not much happens in deep mines
game is a tad slow pace
birds are annoying if you cant built a scarecrow yet
aiming your tools or wep to gather is a little janky
the things you unlock is very random. I guess what I mean is the items needed to built certain things

and as for the obvious, glitches and bugs that I found so far-
you can go full speed on land with the row boat, once you stop, you are stuck, cant pick boat up.
shark can somehow go on land
if you jump a certain way, u will get launched into the air like a super high jump
you can pick up items that are outside, but you are inside

Dinkum approaches many aspects of the formula in ways I wholeheartedly welcome, such as the day/night timekeeping, terrain manipulation, and combat. These are a breath of fresh air and made the game thoroughly enjoyable. 

There are a small handful of downsides, most of which I imagine will get resolved as the game progresses through its early access period. The main angle that I'm not sure will be addressed is largely a matter of personal taste - the NPCs being human and within this art style makes the game less visually appealing in my mind, and the NPCs are largely forgettable by comparison to Animal Crossing NPCs.

Overall, if you want an AC-like game on PC, this is it. If you want AC that doesn't force you to stick with real-time mechanics and punish you for passing time, this is it. However, if you want the cutesy animal NPCs of AC, or a 100% peaceful game with no combat nor hunger mechanics... this probably isn't for you.",1669661608,1669661608,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

I also wish that it was easier to have visitors. Like knowing who's coming or being able to determine who comes (like inviting them to the island).

I have really enjoyed my 30 hours so far and look forward to playing more and new content updates.,1669546609,1669546609,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The deep mine is such a surprise every time and though I was originally concerned about the price to enter, I understand that it gives a real feeling of ""risk it for the biscuit"" mentality. 

There are similarities to Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing, however it gives more freedom and self directed game play. The relationships with townfolk is not as deep and needs more in that respect. There are no challenging characters like original Animal Crossing (were some just straight up hate you) and I don't think you can marry and have children like in Stardew Valley.

I just love the colourful skies, sun rise and sun sets. The fishing is so fun with the way the fish hide and swim along the shore. The Aussie theme is a real blast to see in a game, and carries well in the dialog of the townfolk.

Meaning, there was an attempt to combine awesome games into one, but failed miserably as it doesn't even come close to having any of the same features. It's probably the worst time consuming glitchy game I've played this year. The game has it's appeal in creativity & cuteness, however, that will be short lived due to all the annoyances that come with it. Not to mention the lack of crafting variety & building materials/options makes this game a bit drab.

The multi-player mode is okay if you have someone you trust like close friends or family, but you only make progress on one island - with the exception of keeping the progress made on villagers. If you'd like to make new friends then you could always open your world up to public - which I'd highly recommend if you want some random person in a bat suit joining with bombs and  blowing up your island.

If that doesn't convince you, it's a solo dev subpar game that has been worked since 2017 & is still not finished. The bugs in the game will be slow to fix, new features slow to introduce, & maybe slight functionality  with added features available over a couple (or more) of long years. The community in discord is predominately Australians with elitist type mods - there also seems to be a bit of a nationalist vibe going on. It's a very strict & Australian time-zone type discord. So, if you need help & you're not in that time zone - good luck...you'll be waiting until they're available. 

Only started playing this game to spend time with my sister...I like it less every time I play it. Especially since my favorite part of the game is fishing which is extremely bugged...love having two fish bite my bait just to disappear entirely.

It's got everything you'd want in a game of this type. including a gradual progression to unlock more residents of your island, more buildings, more blueprints to craft items, fixtures, furnishings and stuff! 

On-top of that, It even has Co-op! a Survival System (Eating to restore health and tiredness), Swimming, Hunting, Insect Catching, Fishing, a Local Wildlife Museum Donation, Farming, Trapping, Animal Husbandry, Metal Detecting, Housing, Building, Landscaping, Mining, Player-NPC Relations, Seasons - and the list goes on... The short version is that there is much to do on your island. You can have more than one character, so if you don't like the layout of your island or something early on, you can always make another one!

I'm still learning, still experimenting and still very much on my journey in Dinkum, but jeez, I'm hooked on this game! I really like how you don't have to rush around doing things most the time, you can go at your own pace more or less and, whilst there is nothing specifically wrong with the soundtrack of Dinkum, I do like to put on the chill soundtracks from the Elder Scrolls, Zelda: Ocarina Of Time and Stardew Valley games in the background when I'm playing occasionally just to help myself get lost in this game for more hours than I realize everyday!

My favourite item is definitely the ""Roo Poo"" for sure (Yes, they have Kangaroos and they poo when you're not looking). You really thought of everything, James! I salute you. 

I look forward to putting more hours into Dinkum, and can't wait for future updates.

If you've come this far and you like the sound of it. What are you waiting for? Get all your like-minded friends and just buy this thing already!
