*I have not had a chance to try out the multiplayer yet*, but I've put 3 hours into practice sessions, (both local sessions and on-line sessions.)  Primarily I tried out the GTE cars, but I also spent some time in the LMP2.


The FFB and feel through the wheel in this game is on par (or very close) to the level of iRacing, and far surpasses a more arcadey sim like ACC. All of the controls a driver would have are available to bind to the various buttons, rotaries and funky-switches, and it has a decent UI with a black box that allows for changing all of those settings without having to bind them.

This is a sim with a LOT of promise, I just hope they plan to add a ton of content, and make the on-line races more frequent (as in every 30 mins rather than every 2 hours.)  I feel my early access money was money well-spent, but there are a few bugs, or bindable adjustments that don't work so well, like adjusting your FOV or moving your seat forward/backward/up/down.  Regardless, it's almost dead-on straight out of the box, and based on initial quality level for a Early Access Game, I have no doubt they will get it sorted.

How hard is this sim?
I'd say this game requires about ~80% the skill of iRacing, so most people coming from that sim should have zero trouble. A practice session or two, and you should be ready to rock.

Graphics:
I have an i9-13900k and an Asus ROG RTX 4090, connected to a 49"" 5120 x 1440p widescreen monitor, but even with all graphical settings cranked to maximum, & with 4xMSAA turned on, I'm never dropping below 180fps, and seeing it hit 230 pretty regularly.  
 
I am *assuming* this title will play-nice with lesser GPUs/CPUs, within reason.

Thankfully I can say that my experience has been mostly good so far.

I’m roughly 4.5 hours in at the time of writing this, and I’ve done a bit of single and multiplayer. I’ve driven in the GTE and the Hypercar class- no LMP2 yet. 

Pros:
-mostly stable gameplay 
-no stuttering like some have experienced (in single and multiplayer)
-GTE FFB is some of the best I’ve ever tried
-sound is incredible 
-simhub support (added a radar which is much needed IMO)
-no issues getting wheel and pedals set up and calibrated

Cons:
-FFB is a bit vague in the Hypercars
-steep learning curve for driving the Hypercars
-experienced a couple of full game crashes, with one leading to a wheel glitch (more on this below)
-loading times aren’t great, but on my rig they are better than what some are experiencing 
-no way to set up pit stops before the race, unless I’m missing it?
-multiplayer is a bit confusing before a race start because folks will just start driving when you’re supposed to sit still on the grid, causing mass chaos

That’s about all I can think of at the moment. Will update if I encounter any other items worth noting. Circling back to what I mentioned with my wheel in the cons section- I had a full game crash in multiplayer, and it caused my wheel to glitch. It was rapidly moving back and forth at the full 12nm of torque even though I had it set at 50%. This was truly terrifying at the time, and it almost injured my wrist. I always thought that emergency stop buttons were a waste of money, and today almost found out the hard way that is not the case. PLEASE if you have a direct drive wheel, and don’t currently have any type of easy way to cut power to it, get something. The thought of me going to my adult job, and explaining to my coworkers that I injured my wrist playing a “video game” was enough for me to go ahead and order an emergency stop. 

So is it worth the current price? In my opinion 100%. If you already play AC, ACC, iRacing, AMS2, etc. this is an easy recommendation. Just know there will be some bugs, and it might get frustrating at times, but the driving experience more than makes up for it in my opinion.

Really great work!!!
Apart from some bugs, which are normal for them to be present, being an early access game, the introduction of some simple features is clearly necessary to make the game more playable.

1 - A radar in the race to give a clear situation of the surrounding, to identify the closest cars (perhaps also introducing a box engineer voice that indicates to the player the position of the nearby car).

2 - A video replay of each session (free practice, qualifying and race), which can be watched at the end of the session, leaving the player the choice to save it or not. If the player chooses not to save the replay, the recording is deleted.

3 - The ghost inside the pit lane is not present. This is very interesting, and makes the experience even more simulative, but requires better management of box assignment when multiple players enter at the same time in the pit lane and have pitches next to each other.
On the SPA circuit, as the pit stops places are very close to each other, it may happen that you are unable to get to your own place because another car is already present on the previous one and is making a pit stop. You are therefore forced to go beyond your own lay-by to return there in reverse.

4 - It would be very useful to be able to consult a history of laps times for each race session (free laps, qualifying and race), with the null and valid ones highlighted.

5 - It would be very useful to be able to have, during the lap on the track, not only the chronometer of the current time and the indication of the fastest lap, but also the prediction of the time of the lap being carried out.

Keep updating it and it will be a great simulator.",1708905430,1708905430,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

From gaming perspective LMU is wonderful driving experience, it is a joy to play, of course AI has many issues at this time, but I think it will be sorted out in the process.
UI has some bugs, but nothing I can't manage. For example when I set race time it doesn't work in single player. Minimum race length is buggy, sets minimum length from previous race. Cursor sometimes disappearing then mapping buttons.
One of the most annoying thing when I disable practice and qualifying, in advanced menu I still see practice and qualifying settings, whats even worse is that they are top, and to set race settings I need to scroll to the bottom, it is very annoying, after some time.
To set race start time and weather is very complicated process, would be nice, to have time and weather settings accessible in the single page. If it is complicated maybe you can add custom user presets, for advanced settings it would be very useful.
I do not see where I can set AI driver count is it possible?
It would be great to have ability to clean windscreen dirt (for example using wipers, now wipers removes only rain, but no translucent dirt marks), sometimes I would like to have clean screen without marks.

I can absolutely recommend LMU to all, who like racing games, even more who has direct drive wheel. Visuals in this game looks so good on rtx 3080, I can say it is one of the best looking racing game in the market. It looks event better then Forza motorsport and ACC in most scenarios, in Forza maybe volumetric fog looks nicer. One thing that cached my eye in LMU is Moiré pattern in midday time and aliasing issue some times, it is common issue on games which does not support resolution scaling. Also noticeable issue is shimmering shadows but also in midday, everything else is just perfect.

Will write up something tomorrow that might flip the thumb up...

EDIT (old review at bottom):
The game crashes when you run any overclocking or undervolting. Reset e.g. MSI Afterburner and it should sort the crashes to desktop. The sim then works. 

Performance is ok, not overwhelming. It looks decent enough to play, nothing to be called 'next gen' by any means. Don't expect much else than what you already know from rf2. This is essentially rf2 stripped down to a single series/license. You will feel that wherever you go: driving wise, weird menu options and structure, unexpected UX or other annoying stuff. The menu holds everything of the rf2 menu, just shuffled into a new equally random order. Menu, Sub Menu, sub sub menu, double items, weirdly places items. 

I think the most annoying thing for me is that I was hoping they'd take rf2, but make it a GOOD GAME, good to use, smart elegant solutions to things. But none of this is visible. They still struggle to make you access their sim in an efficient user friendly way. A menu running at 3 fps with several second input delay or needing alt+tab for the screen to refresh is just not really acceptable. There are just so many ""WHY??"" moments: 

Having to run inverted ffb by default for almost everyone, but it not being the default setting is the most irrelevant of these things. 
Not being able to bind multiple functions to the same key (e.g. with shift or key combinations like iracing or ACC).
The ESC key turning on and off the hud instead of doing the typical ESC functionality.
Generally needing a billion clicks to do easy stuff.
Having to drive from the paddock for 50s before entering the track.
Every menu click causing a transition animation. If you main this game you'll collect hours watching that transition instead of having a snappy menu.
Many menu buttons being hidden behind the steering wheel that most players will simply have in front of the screen in that position. Have they ever used the menu with the intention to actually play the game? It does not seem like it. 

I still very much feel everything that is bad about the rf2 experience here. the only thing they removed is the management of content by removing all the content. narrowing it down to a series is probably good to get players into the same lobbies and actually have someone to race. But the way to get to race is by fair and large still the worst UI/UX in the entire simracing space. Up to you if you want to bear that. 

So all in all I can't recommend it. Maybe at a future time when it has matured and should they actually remove/fix the annoying parts.

Old review:
This is nowhere near ready.

The menu runs at 5 fps. I had to alt+tab each time i clicked something in the menu, for it to refresh the screen. v-sync on, off, i dont care. The game crashed every 3 minutes on track, if we ever got there. 

The FPS are a joke. Minimum settings on a 3080ti and 7800x3d with DDR5 6000mhz. You might make it above 100!

Driving feel and FFB is top notch, graphic and sound wise also on par with the best in the business. AI despite some hiccups it's also one of the best I the business.

I don't have a DD wheel, I'm currently stuck with a Thrustmaster TS-PC, so I may lack the detail of stronger and better wheelbases but the game is literally a copy-paste-strip version of rF2 which, for me, offers the ideal ""feel"" for the hardware I own. In LMU, however, first of all there is the ever-annoying deadzone in the middle which they knew about well before the release of this ""early access"" but didn't bother fixing first. Then, there is the terrible lack of force feedback at low speeds, which in my case, results in an unavoidable spin everytime I've got to coast through a sharp corner. When the car, for example the Aston Martin GTE, is at 60KM/h, I feel almost nothing at all in the wheel so when the rear inevitably starts sliding out and trying to catch the front of the car, I only learn about that fact when it's already sideways and way too late to correct it. I've tried about 10 races on Sebring in that car with the AI and finished one of them, it's just absolutely impossible for me to go faster than 2:02 without spinning somewhere at the end of the first or in the second sector without getting ANY feedback about the rear of the car losing traction when it does. Having direct comparison to rF2 with the same car/track combo, it's apparent that there is something terribly wrong with LMU's feedback or its interraction with my particular wheelbase and the way s397 has worked under the scammy management of MSG, I am not exactly optimistic about receiving a fix for it.",1708889570,1708889570,False,4,1,0.554210484027862549,0,True,False,True

This is yet another rFactor 2 ""item pack"", sold as a brand new standalone sim. With the usual money grab tactic: Overlapping content that you had previously purchased such as same tracks, same cars. An engineered tactic that Studio 397 has been using for years.

[b] I hate it but it has to be said in this day and age of media influence power: [/b]
The <1% major YouTube/platform influencers with their 99% hearded voices are mild in their judgment. Because they live from this kind of content! They get free expensive racing wheels, expensive direct drive bases, hydraulic pedals, free software, privileged “first-hand trips”, privileged ""elite race invites"", and more importantly a list of “AFFILIATE / PARTNERS” links!
Good for them! But they tend -or forced- to be dishonest for keeping their privileges and influences-income.

We, the rest of >99% sim racers, have to think twice about what our money is being spent on.
Make no mistake! Le Mans Ultimate is an rFactor 2 reskin. That means with the accompanying very old rFactor engine sold as brand new in 2024!
Yes, it is in “early-access” phase. But the price is still too high for existing rFactor 2 users. Again, you are buying a lot of duplicate content that you had already purchased before. And also in a half-baked state with not much of improvement because..... old same engine.

For people who have never bought rFactor 2 but want to taste Le Mans with good physics, FFB, flatspotting tyres in realtime weather rainy sunset. You are better off with Automobilista 2 sim (preferably in many sales) + Le Mans DLC. It costs about the same, but then you have much, much more basic content! And feels much more modern. While with Le Mans Ultimate/rFactor 2 you stare at an endless loading screen, with Automobilista 2 you have already completed a lap or two. Automobilista 2 physics, FFB and endurance-races updates have been matured till the point of one of the best.

For exclusive VR headset racers: Le Mans Ultimate in 2024 does NOT support VR!!! It seems like a bad joke but it's true for now. VR will come later, may-be. But if it arrives expect same questionable VR-performance as rFactor 2.
RaceDepartment platform had recently held a major poll. This showed that the vast majority preferred VR headset racing over the single/triple/widescreen setups anno 2024.

For exclusive VR headset racers, Automobilista 2 is the best of all sims if you speaking of physics/FFB//visual fidelity/audio/loading times/UI/HUD/performance all and everything in VR.

The only thing that Le Mans Ultimate does very good, and it's the same as rFactor 2, is the physics...... when it works, .... like rFactor 2 when it works. Go figure!

OK it will be VERY Early Access review.... but very few hours into Le Mans Ultimate I think I can say something about it.

First of all: IT FEELS FINE. That is the most important thing for a simulator. Driving in LMU is natural, very close to rF2 as you may expect, but somehow feels even more natural and realistic (not pointlessly tough, just realistic) in LMU. Since very first second on the racetrack I've enjoyed driving cars, no matter the category. You can clearly see differences and FEEL differences that you saw during TV broadcast of WEC races. You have similar struggles as real drivers - freezing cold tyres, hypercars being just close to LMP2 but with more power, LMP2 from Oreca being very complete, nice, refined and composed car, GT's which for me... feel way more like a GT than in ACC - of course I am comparing GTEs to GT3's which are two worlds, but....

So yes, driving is exactly how you would expect it to be, and maybe even better. Only thing I am struggling with are brakes. Every thing I know about race cars and every simracing game thought me that you can hit brakes hard and then release it gradually. Not here. Here locking up is very easy, even at quite decent speed. That is only thing I needed to get used to. Rest feels exactly how it should, and you don't need to ""learn"" the game as in other simulators.

Bad thing is number of glitches and bugs. I know it is EA, but hey... LMU will be mainly about online, yes? So maybe it would be nice to release kinda working online mode, which does not kick you out after half of the lap, or does actually refresh server status, so for 10 minutes you are not trying to join servers which are full?

But full servers means number of players is above expectations so it is a good thing I guess?

All in all online not working properly (or not at all) is, from my point of view, the BIG thing to complain about. 

BUT, and here comes the ugly, LMU is looking far worse than ACC at its release and that was 5 years ago! I know it is a simulator and I know graphics are not as important as physics but hey - we live in 2024, and rF2 looks had never been jaw dropping, to say the least. LMU looks like rF2 to me, so a decade old title. Le Mans 24 and WEC deserve something more, but I can't see that happening with this engine unfortunately.

So yes, you may expect bugs. A LOT OF. Yes, at this moment you may miss main content of the game like online play. Yes, you may feel like playing TEST DRIVE II when looking at the graphics. But when you just get into the car and start driving... man, you can really forget about all of this and just enjoy the drive.

True early access, you're going to be testing the sim more than enjoying a near final product in early 2024. That being said, if you like rF2 and endurance racing, you're going to appreciate LMU. It has inherited many of the things that makes rF2 great (tires, FFB, handling and driving dynamics). It has inherited quite a few things that make rF2 frustrating. It has so far improves on some of the things that rF2 is known for lacking (decent UI namely).

- So far, only played quick race, no online
- Casual level player, albeit with a lot of experience in most racing games - not the fastest, single monitor, and using a controller as have no wheel right now.
- Playing on a moderately decent gaming laptop (ASUS Strix G16)
- Going in with expectations of ""Early Access""
- Have been active on the studios Discord.

With that all out the way, I first off want to say I LOVE this game.

Before launch I was concerned how this would handle with a controller. I really appreciate that Forza is playable with a controller (where something like ACC isnt really), so that was great. I'd probably say its one of the best handling games with a controller I've ever played, allowing you to get a feeling of ""sim"" experience, but without needing a wheel. There are some assists that kick in, some quite heavy automatic counter-steer takes some getting used to, but dont think this is an easy drive, its extremely rewarding to just finish a race as anything but GTE cars need a very gentle hand - but again, not to the point of it being impossible to drive. The balance is perfect IMO.

The first hours/days was a bit buggy but 397 have been right on it, collecting feedback and being quick to react with either deploying bug fixes or just being on hand to give out advice. It has been a really great community feel so far, long may that continue.

We know its early access, so besides the bugs, it is lacking in some content - but its FINE! For anyone moaning, again EARLY. ACCESS. Content will come, but 7 tracks and a nice range of cars over 3 classes is perfect for now.

Personally for me, I've not driven Sebring much, so to have that in the game as a huge fan of USA motorsport where it isnt (officially) available in most other games has been brilliant and fast become one of my favourite sim racing tracks. Reminds me of the old Burke Lake Airport track with how bumpy it is. And about those bumps, FINALLY a game that nails the feeling of bouncing around in a race car. So many games feel so lifeless, with no cockpit movement and the wheel not being impacted by the track. Driving in this game feels like a bucking bronco and again, just so rewarding to hang on for a race.

For the races, I've mainly been sticking to GTEs and 30ish minute race time (with a x24 accelerated clock time to give a day/night transition) and x4 fuel and tyres. So far its working perfectly at those settings and you get a real feel of an endurance race with the changing light and a couple of pit stops. Hypercars are much harder to drive (on a controller) but certainly not impossible at all, just have to be extra careful. The GTEs are far more forgiving though and you can get some brilliant racing.

Performance wise I'm definitely satisfied. Frame rate holds up nicely (albeit 14 visible cars set) and at times it looks real nice. I can probably tune some better visuals in I think, but I'd rather be racing than mucking around. For what it is, I think it looks fine - and as I say, performance feels like its a solid 60fps on my laptop.

So in summary, this is a great start for a new PC sim. Nice to have something different with the WEC series and huge props for the controller support allowing more people to have a chance to play. I cant wait to get stuck into online!

My best experiences over the last few days have definitely been Sebring, simulating 12 hours, GTEs and completing a full race. Absolute edge of the seat stuff.

Final tip (this was from the devs too), is to run a qualifying session. Every if you start the session, then skip it. Doing this will sort the cars in the right classes for the race, rather than have a mixed grid which causes absolute chaos at starts.

Highly recommended - if you like racing games then you have to get this. If you worried you dont have a wheel, dont be, you'll have a great time.

2. The lack of controller support is astounding - in theory you can use a controller when in the race, but you can't use it to navigate the menus well because the controller prompts don't show up, and in any case, controller steering is terribly calibrated to the point that you basically can't steer with it.

It forgets your sound settings (I constantly have to adjust my settings each time I open the sim up to the ""headset"" mode) etc.

But When you're up and driving, this is by quite a big margin compared to other mainstream non-Studio 397 sims, the best driving experience on the market for GT cars and LMP Cars, and of course Hypercars; but few sims offer these at the moment.

What makes me say that, you may ask? The following points stand out:

1. FFB:
This game has without a doubt imho the best ffb out of any sim on the market. This might shock you to hear the first time you open it up, since the ffb is very raw as it comes stock. But ones you find the right settings for your wheelbase and your liking, it legit feels like you're right there in the cockpit. You feel everything from the wheels slipping under you, the mass of the car shifting on the tires, flatspots on your wheel (depending on how severe they are), how attached the car is to the road (for example after a crash) and so much more. Yet crucially, in comparison to sims like AC, it doesn't feel canned or unrealistic, while providing way more useful and immersive feedback than sims that only simulate the forces on the steering rack such as iRacing or ACC. It even feels better than the imo previous owner of the title: ""Best ffb"", RF2. For context, I use an Asetek Invicta base, and it took just a couple of hours to get it dialed in and on the bright side, I have yet had to adjust settings across tracks; it is very consistent in terms of ffb across the different tracks of the title in terms of general feel.

2. Ai Racing:
I have heard some people complain about the AI in this game, which I actually don't understand. Personally I have only done Ai Racing so far, and I have found them to be very competent after adjusting some settings in game. The only thing I would add is that you should have the AI's aggresion pretty low, since the AI can have some pretty eratic behaviour on mid-high aggresion settings. For example, one LMP2 car crashed in to me at Eau Rouge by driving to overtake through it. I would run it at 20-25 fyi, which provides realistic, aggresive yet not reckless racing.

3. Sound:
The game has the best sound of any sim on the market. Provided you have good audio equipment. I sometimes difficult to fully describe how good it sounds. For me personally as an audiophile besides my simracing hobby, this is an incredible pro of this sim. Nothing on the market touches this currently in terms of sound.

So is this game for you?

It depends on what you want in a sim. If you seek the most realistic handling and feeling game on the market atm, yes absolutely, this game is for you, as long as you don't mind dealing with bugs and annoyances; and editing config files.

If thats not what you prioritize mainly in a sim, then wait some time and see how the title matures, and if it gets to a more bug-free state, then consider buying it.

So is it worth $30?

For me, absolutely.",1708827710,1708827710,True,3,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,True

Primary reason: I use a large TV/Monitor for my gaming - and I get crazy screen tearing in this game, or if I set a v-sync I get an instant crash. In this regard it's unplayable.

Worth noting that in the 3+ years of regular racing with my setup as it is, this is the first time I've seen a proper MS blue screen of death - my PC has been rock solid until this game.

So to my 1 hour in experience, putting that aside:
- Graphics - OK, not going to wow you, but really OK. Compare to really well sorted RF2, without the hassle.
- Handling/physics - Good. Many other games are up there, but certainly the feel of this game is great.
- Sound - Does sound fantastic.
- Racing - Can't say for sure, too much issues with the above tearing to really get into a race.
- Overall - I like it, I'll buy it again at some point once I note an update that has optimisation in it. 

In terms of ecosystem (as at early access):
- SimHub & bass shaker, worked
- CriewChief, on it's way already, but not implimented
- Stryder-it, not working
- Fanatec (918 rim), shift lights not working


I think I'd like to own this game, but I found myself thinking I could set these races up in AC/CMS without much trouble, or get very close in AMS2, saving me grief on the way through.

Looking forward to the GT3s and new Hypercars!

[b]Update 1 (2h ingame):[/b] 
- It feels fantastic and looks great (for the rF2 engine). 
- Lightning is way better. The tracks are way more detailed and everything looks way more vivid and lively. 
- The wheel gets deteced directly. AI feels very good. UI is good, too. 

Positives: 
- max tires sets per weekend
- real weather per mouse click (I think, it is real weather. Probably from the events in 2023)
- Triple-Setup is supported (But i cannot setup it correctly)

Negatives: 
- UI is slow (but everything works!)

[b]Update 2 (3h ingame):[/b] 
- LMU feels great. The physics are better than in rF2. 
-  Triple screens can be adjusted in the controller.json (ingame: Not yet possible)
- Sounds and onboard settings are very, very detailed. 
- Tire model has improved, too. Tires need longer get the right temperature. Braking feels a bit better, because you feel the grip level of the tires better. (o.c. compared to rF2)
- Way better lightning, compared to rF2. 
- One crash of the game: I really don´t know why. But i had to switch off the wheelbase. 

Nagative reviews on steam: 
- It´s an EA title. I can understand, that some peoble that cannot start the game gave a negative review. But giving a negative review, because some mussing settings, some crashes or something like that, is not unterstandable for me personally. The game needs some time. 30€ is more than fair to me.

[b]Update 3 (~8h ingame):[/b] 
- I had some online and some offine races. Online worked very well - No netcode issues or something like that. But: Once i could not load join the races. So I had to restart the game. Maybe it´s the Windows 11 issue, that the UI gets very slowly. Will have a look at it the next days. 
- Performance in Bahrain could be better - probably because of the thousands of lights. But I had the time scaled 20x. Could be an issue, too. (7900 xtx, 5900x, 1440p triples, Settings on high)

My favorite tracks and cars at the moment: 
- 1. LMP2 Oreca
- 2. AMR GTE 
- 3. Porsche  963 Hypercar

- 1. Sebring (big update to the rF2-version)
- 2. Fuji... 
- 3. ...and Portimao - Simply because of being good tracks and ""new to rF2""

[b]Update 4 (10h ingame):[/b] 
- I did a little research: If you want to use SimHub, you can use the rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin. Just download it, put it into the folliwing folder (SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Le Mans Ultimate/Plugins), start the newest version of SimHub from their Homepage (9.2.1) and activate Simhub for Le Mans Ultimate. It works directly. 
- There is also a third party app, that works like Helicorsa in AC. It seems to work, but i don´t like Helicorsa or something like that. It breaks the immersion for me personally. 
- If somebody knows, how CrewChief works with LMU: Please let me know!

- I did some more practices and races offline: And I realized, that I think, that S397 should do some work regarding the Hypercars. The FFB (at least in my case) feels not as natural as it feels within the GTE and LMP2 cars. I simply cannot find the maximum grip level of the cars. I don´t really feel it within the cars. It helped, to check if the track isn´t ""green"" within the practice sessions. But at least in my humble opinion, the hypercars need some rework to be done. The are way faster than the LMP2s on the straight. but not as grippy as the LMP2 cars in corners. At least i don´t feel it as much as i feel the other car classes. I think, that will need some adjustments from the developers. If you think, that i´m wrong: Please let me know in the comments. Maybe some FFB adjustments will help already (My wheelbase: Fanatec DD1: Recommended settings for rF2).

[b]Update 5:[/b] 
Thanks to Roy from the comments: There is a Crew Chief beta available, that works with LMU: You can find the link to the Crew Chief Beta [url=https://thecrewchief.org/showthread.php?38-Beta-Test-Thread] HERE [/url]. You have to manually deinstall the old version of Crew Chief and install the new one.

[b]Update 6 (16h ingame):[/b] 
- I found the reason for my big problem with the hypercars: The point ""Use steering wheel Range from vehicle"" is connected to ""Sets car-specific FFB multiplier"" in LMU and the other one reversed, too. It's even described as the wrong one, too.

I totally messed up my settings with this one, because it's connected to the wrong menu point, I think. Even if it's not: The description is wrong in the menu and i feel the cars 10 times better now. I reset it to default. (in rF2: It only changes the angle, here it seems, that it is conncted to the FFB)

Now the hypercars are a lot of fun and very challenging, because you have to heat up the tires for at leas two or three laps to get grip and traction. Very, very challening and lots of fun!",1708434033,1708815583,True,460,5,0.927848160266876221,14,True,False,True

It also comes with bugs and instability which however were not critical to me. I have only experienced issues with loading  events and in the menus. Once the race is underway, no problems so far.

Compared to base RF2 however, we have updated graphics, better multiclass AI and tire behavior which I like much  better (less overheating, more forgivable).

So overall, official WEC  content plus these small improvements to the best ever sim racing physic engine make it the pinnacle of sim racing.

Sought a refund for the game as there were too many small issues that essentially stopped me from being able to drive competitively/safely online.

- HUD/menus would run at less that 1fps whilst in a session, so making small setup changes like adjusting *only* fuel levels could take a full minute, despite the fact the game was running in the background at 100fps.
- Steering linearity suddenly broke for no reason, so turning the wheel just over 90 degrees would react as if the wheel was being turned more than 180 degrees, and the sensitivity would ramp up through the turning of the wheel rather than remaining consistent.
- Lots of elements of the in-game menus won't visually respond to commands even if they actually do, such as changing weather settings for a session.
- Would struggle to connect frequently to practice servers for online daily races
- HUD scaling is extremely bad; particularly the speedo, where the background element would stretch vertically (or squash horizontally, can't remember which) for no reason. Ideally, we'd have the option of resizing/moving elements to exactly where we want them.

Quite a shame, because I think the content, the driving feel, and the sounds are largely rather good. That being said, if it takes 5 minutes to get into a practice server, up to 3 minutes to load the assets for a session, and then 3 minutes just to get the fuel level where you want it, then I'm not willing to play a title that's literally wasting my time. Of the 90 mins of gameplay, only c.20 mins of that was me driving.

Did a few more races, LMP2 cars take a bit to get used to but fun to drive.
Their is an issue where the AI cars will rear end you or spin you out in a corner.

Just tried to do a 1 hour Le-Man race, I was unable to due to the AI trying to drive through me, it is such a good game apart from the fact that most of the time the AI cars will just drive through you causing you to spin out or get pushed to the side or back.

Any publicity is good publicity, on some level, even if it is this bottom feeding approach to marketing. They're not the only game developers doing this, it seems to be a corporate tradition.

Of course potential won't make a game better without support from the devs and so far what I've seen leads me to believe these devs will deliver.

Now I will say the load times are still really bad, they are getting better. When I first started playing I had to run on medium graphics and the fps was still horrible! after several patches I am able to run on high graphics in 1440 and am getting fantastic fps, although on some tracks (i.e. Algarve International ) the fps does drop in some areas. I however am pretty confident the devs will sort out the optimization. Unfortunately this review isn't all puppy dogs and rainbows though, overall the ui feels clunky and not being able to access certain settings without returning to the main menu is a royal pain.

It's not bad. It's just not impressive, and overly hyped. Hyped to the point I'm about to puke over web sites and all these Youtubers' channels.

It took me 10 - 15 minutes to configure, to end up with the same FF bugs/malfunctions than in RF2. Normal would you say, it's the same game, hum, game engine, sorry.
My setup is build around a good old Thrustmaster Base TX + the first model of Ferrari wheel. It should be recognized properly without needing more than 30 seconds of settings.

I ran a few online races today, I am honestly even more impressed with that part. I play mostly iRacing recently. The netcode is far superior to iRacing, you can actually make contact and not immediately fly off the track. The cutting/off track policing system is also far superior to iRacing, its not even close. iRacings slowdowns for example is a completely broken joke of a system compared to what this game has.

A fucking early access game vs. The """"leading"""" motorsport simulator which has worse physics, FFB, tire model, netcode, etc. This game with this online mode on day one makes iRacing look like an overpriced clownshow (it always was but there used to be no competition for online play at all) to be honest, kinda embarrassing iRacing... 

OG Review on day one:
I honestly though this will be a massive disaster. But it isn't that bad at all. I started off with 3 crashes, but ever since then it runs great. Its basically rf2 with a shiny new coat, so the physics, the FFB, the driving is great. I always loved rf2 but a few years ago I just lost hope on it and stopped playing it. This gives me some of that hope back, this new UI system is finally something usable, time will tell how they treat the bugs, new content, online stuff etc. I also hope some of the improvements made here will make it's way into rf2 as well.

I'm really enjoying racing the Hypercars, especially the Porsche 963, Ferrari 499P, and Cadillac V-Series.R at Le Mans :) The cars drive brilliantly, the graphics are excellent, and the sounds are amazing (especially the 499P). The UI is also quite clean and modern, particularly compared to iRacing. Not to mention, probably the biggest benefit of going with LMU: it's price. LMU is ridiculously cheap compared to purchasing the equivalent content in iRacing (as well as the iRacing subscription fee).

I just wish I could set race length at Le Mans to less than an hour (like 20 or 30 mins), and that the FPS was more consistent. Currently, I find multi-class sessions to be a bit laggy, especially in the pits, which is why I mainly run practice/quali/races in a Hypercar-only session (no multi-class), which is practically buttery smooth. In such sessions, I've encountered virtually no bugs, and a stellar experience.

The sounds are it's best feature, they are 1:1 with the official onboards.
It's also very good on a controller, good feedback and handling. Tho haptic feedback on the Dualsense would be great if you guys ever consider it.

There are a few negatives to point out. First of all is the starting grid if you choose to skip qualifying, it completely mixes up the grid instead of mixing the cars per classes. Which means a race might start with a GTE P1 and an LMP2 P2.

I'd say there is a slight lack of polish, definitely needs to be more well optimized. The stutters are the worst part.

In terms of performance, a word of advice: steer clear of enabling any FSAA settings as it seriously tanks the FPS, big time. Personally, I made a jump from a 72Hz monitor to a 120Hz one, and it transformed the game into something 100% more enjoyable. It's not just about the expected improvements; running the game at a higher refresh rate actually resolved numerous FPS drops. For instance, Monza went from a choppy 25fps on a 72Hz monitor to a silky smooth 90-100fps on my 120Hz, all while maintaining the same graphic settings – quite an unexpected but welcome outcome.

Admittedly, there are a few bugs lingering around (I've only encountered a slow UI), but despite that, this simulator stands out as one of the best.

I use a non-direct drive (DD) wheel, specifically the T248, and the force feedback with default settings is nothing short of amazing. What's noteworthy is that this is the only game where all the buttons are intuitively preset to smart positions on the wheel.

At £25, this is an absolute steal and will be my go-to simulator for the foreseeable future.

Want to race an LM-whatever car in a competitive environment without having to pay hundreds/thousands of dollars to iRacing? This sim is our best chance of reaching that dream.

The pros:
- The LMP2 and LMDH cars feel AMAZING. The thrill of their speed, sounds, and just raw unhinged energy is what's got me hooked.
- Coming from ACC, the GTEs feel solid to me; good but nothing special. The lack of ABS is a lot of fun if not challenging to come to terms with, but it makes wheel-to-wheel racing that much more exciting.
- The netcode seems to be very good. I've had a few online races and have yet to experience any lag, warping, or rubber banding. This makes racing hard and close really fun, where as ACC you frequently had at least a small degree of rubber banding.
- A built-in ranking system. Yes LFM really brought life back to ACC, but absolutely nothing beats the built-in ranking system of iRacing. In LMU, we have a good foundation that might come to compete with that. There is driver and safety ratings, as well as frequent daily races (for EU times, but I racing mornings in the US on EST so it works for me). I'm looking forward to seeing this system develop over time and how it compares to both iRacing and LFM in the long run.
- The game looks decent. It won't blow your mind, but it's not bad either. Most people, myself included, have to run the game on High because Ultra grinds the game to a halt, but hopefully with upcoming patches and DLSS/FSR the optimization and visuals will increase. For reference, on High I get ~120-144(capped) fps on a 2080 super and 58003xd
- There have been two hot fixes in the first two days. Obviously it's too early to tell long-term, but immediate support and resources seem to be there and the Discord community is already active and ready to help.

The bad (as of 3 days past post-launch):
- Still get some crashes when joining a race. I'd say 1 in every 3, maybe 4 races I'll crash when I join, both single player and online. The good news is that I haven't had a game crash during a race yet so that's nice. The other piece of good news is you are able to rejoin the online races during the practice and quali sessions which helps make up for the crashing. (I think you can rejoin during race as well, but I haven't had to myself yet so can't confirm).
- The menu FPS while in the garage is atrocious. Literally less than 1 FPS. There are a few things you can do to make it bearable, but even then it's still laggy and slow to update. I followed their suggestions in their Discord for common issues and they helped but it's still slow. For reference, what worked for me was capping my max framerate in the settings.json to 143 (monitor refresh rate - 1) and changing ""Record To Memory"" to true, and turning V-Sync in-game to ""Software.""

In summary, it was a buggy launch but the actual driving experience so good! I'm hoping time and feedback will make this game great. Worth the buy IMHO, and definitely not worth the review bombing.",1708698960,1708698960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Great Online scheduled lobbies, so nice to know when what will happen, and it is presented in-game 5-stars option
Nice ranking system
No private lobbies
Manageable amount of tracks and cars
Nice graphics, especialy at night
Good performance, up par with AMS2 for me
good HUD and ICM
a lots of mapable settings, and usable even with fixed setups
( I never thought it would matter for me, but due to the scheduled races, the game feels populated and makes me feel being part of something.......)

Con's

Game is Early access- lots of things simply not implemented.
FFB is not that good, feels very floaty on low speeds (biggest con for me)
Tire sound are terrible soft, tire scrubbing sounds seems absent (so the lack of tire sound and bad FFD at low speed makes taking slow corners always a gamble)

Speaking of potential: I'm dreaming of a game/simulator like that for 30 yrs. now. LMU is the perfect platform - and to me it's only 3 features away from this dream coming true.

Always have in mind: This is EA. There are features missing, there are bugs that absolutely need to be adressed, there are inconsistencies that need to be ironed out.
My perspective of the whole project: I'm coming from rf2 and the WEC is my favourite series. So it's a no-brainer to invest in this EA.

Comparison of my major topics LMU vs. rf2 (highly subjective!):
Functionality: More or less the same - the biggest item on my wish list is saving a game mid-race which is not possible in both titles. For LMU it is part of the ""roadmap"", haven't seen any comitment to bring this to rf2.
Graphics: I would think that rf2 is better here as LMU takes more resources. So if in theory its GFX should be better, it is not necessarily so as I have to turn some GFX settings lower.
Realism: rf2's Endurance Pack is great. I have tried the F488 in both (feels more connected in rf2) and the ORECA07 (feels a lot more connected in LMU). As the LMPs are where my heart is, LMU beats rf2 here already. Plus we get the Hypercars (which I didn't try so far as there are no official cars of that type in rf2).
Gameplay/Immersion: SC/SZ/FCY still missing in both titles. In LMU we'll get them for sure as it's a dedicated endurance title. Not sure about rf2.
Sound: Already lots better in LMU (I love the sound of sand/stones hurled against my windscreen when the guy in front of me goes off-track).

Summed up, LMU is worth the investment for me because it's the platform that will see the most love from the devs - so we'll get the missing features before we get them on rf2 (if at all in rf2...)

Buy it, if you love endurance racing and can live with the EA status right now. It's perfectly playable if you invest a bit of time in tinkering with settings. You will be rewarded.
Don't buy it, if you hate the idea of tinkering. (in any case I think that tinkering with stuff is part of simplaying anyway)
Don't expect a perfectly finished game for the casual player to jump in for half an hour once a week - it needs more time to use it to its full potential.

The only drawback is that it still takes a day to load a race unlike ACC which is almost instantaneous, and the loading into the race is also a bit of a drawback. But, once in the race and no matter the series or car your in its instantly one of the best sims you'll race this year.  I have an affinity for the vanilla AC but with a lot of aftermarket updates, it to me is the best race sim on the market and why is that. It's because as you drive the whole world moves along with you, and in later sims it doesn't. The way they move the world is definitely less enjoyable than AC.

It clearly is in EA stage, but it also [b]deserves to be called a game already[/b]. Luckily, this is [i]not[/i] a tech demo that hopes for modders to turn it into a game, like we have seen it way too many times with EA titles.

My opinion after 500 miles:

Pros:
* Good driving model and physics, fun to drive. 
* A fun selection of tracks (the 7 circuits from the 2023 LMD series)
* A good amount of cars in different classes
* local single player 'race week' option, including training, qualifying, and the race. Tons of settings to fine tune the race (weather, classes, rules, ...) and your car setup.
* multi-class racing supported
* many settings for assists, AI difficulty and aggressiveness
* Fair asking price (30€ at EA launch) for what you get
* Transparency regarding issues: there is a list of open issues on the store page in the updates section.
* First patch came after a day. :D

Cons (in early access some of these are to be expected):
* I experienced 4 crashes of the game so far. Crashes are of course extremely demotivating in a game like this. I hope it won't happen more often. This is the most severe issue on this negative list. UPDATE: I reduced graphics settings that take a lot of video memory (texture quality) and the number of visible cars after I noticed a pattern in the crashes: crashes occurred when many vehicles where in my line of sight. Since then, I have not had any crashes.
* Poor optimization. The slow-menus-in-game issue. But it's not that bad: I have a GeForce 2080 and the driving on high settings in 2560x1440 feels great. If they want to add VR, they will definitely need to work on this a bit more though. Also loading times are quite long for the tracks, but hey, you will stay on the track for quite a while. ;)
* Force feedback settings and controls will require some tweaking, the defaults were very weird for me. (I tried Xbox One controller and Fanatec wheel). Nothing major though, and it's quite common for a sim racing title that you spend the first 30 minutes in the menus.
* The graphics are decent, but not what I expected from the promotional images and videos to be honest. It is somewhere between Automobilista 2 and Assetto Corsa Competizione. So definitely fine, but also no reason to get it over those titles because of more up-to-date graphics. I like good graphics. If you do not care that much, you will be absolutely fine. Even I am fine, it's just that the images on their website looked like a lot more and I was looking forward to that. (And the graphics are [i]not[/i] something that I would expect to change a lot until the final release.) I hope they work a bit more on the visuals of the weather effects (rain drops, puddles with reflections) and clouds in bad weather. In the end I think the graphics are okay, but they should use more realistic sales material. ;)


Neutral/Informational:
* There is multiplayer via an online service that tracks clean racing etc. Not my cup of tea and hardly possible for me (I have family and need to be able to pause the game). I have not tested  it, most likely never will, and cannot comment on it in any ways.
* [strike]The shortest race format is more than 1 hour long (plus qualifying) so make sure you have some time before you start a session. As this is a Le Mans endurance game, I do not list this as a negative point.[/strike] This seems to depend on the track and their are some UI bugs around this, read the list of known issues for more information on it.
* Tire wear and the tendency of cars to drift/loose grip seems quite high compared to similar cars in other sim racing titles.

Todos (stuff that must be implemented before they can call it v1.0):
* VR support
* Ability to control the menus with your wheel/controller buttons. Currently you have to switch to mouse and keyboard to navigate the menus, which can be quite annoying depending on your hardware setup.
* Time trial with global leaderboards (per class and track condition) would be very nice
* Performance, loading time, stability improvements

Yes, this game has a lot of problems/bugs, but the ones that I have noticed are already in developers 'known issues list', so I hope they will be fixed soon.
Yes, the game is missing some features, but there's a list of feature requests by the community, which I hope the developer will implement in the game in the near future.
Settings allow you to make the ffb pull strong, yet I would still prefer to have more details (don't really feel the road as much as I'd like, the cars feel a bit 'floaty'). As mentioned before, could be T300RS fault, but AC1 feels better, even if not as realistic.
BUT I do believe that if developer fixes these issues, the game has potential to become the perfect sim for me. I can't explain this, but I feel addicted to this game, it feels more addicting even than ACC with LFM (for me) which I considered almost perfect. I only race online, the ranking system puts me together with a lot of great racers and I have already had some amazing fights (getting a radar mod helped, but it should come to the game officially soon, I hope). Yes, there are random rammers, but usually they can't keep up with the front of the split. I believe they will filter out more and more with improving SR.
Apart for some annoying bugs, the game runs good for me and I honestly like it already, so I hope it will get better and better with each day. From my experience so far, I can strongly recommend it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did not play much yet, but from first impression I believe that this game has overall decent start but still a long way to go. 

My specs: 7800x3d, 7800xt, 64 gb ram, fast SSD. Did not experience any lag issues or crashing. 

Experienced occasional bugs here and there (almost impossible to join a practice server, one online race was fine, second time it was stuck on ""starting servers"", could not get in the session). If other players join practice server after me, car displays as default Porsche (known bug, according to developer).

Restarting the game often helps with minor problems, noticed that I had to restart quite a few times, but solved most of the issues like that.

We need RADAR ASAP, if clean racing is to be expected online, very difficult to see around you with one monitor.

Graphics are OK, IMO. 

FFB is decent, but it does feel like driving on ice a bit (maybe T300RS or settings issue). Seems rather similar to ACC (AC1 feels better for me). 

I hope developer will pay lots of attention to improving multiplayer experience.",1708460350,1708667838,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you're a hardcore sim racer who mainly plays racing sims for the driving/racing experience, you have a pretty decent pc, you enjoy this type of racing, and you don't mind dealing with the quirks and bugs that come with an early access game. Then I can recommend you this game as of right now. 

If you're more of a causal sim racer not looking for the most authentic driving experience, but more a fun game with many features/content and is more stable overall, I would wait a little bit longer before picking this up.

The only issue I have with this game right now is dull feeling ffb on mid corner. I use a fanatec csl dd 8nm and sometimes for me, I have no idea what the car is doing. So I either drive under the limit, or fight the car through the corner exit.

Another issue that I had was random crashes and stutters which I assume was from running graphics settings too high. This issue seems to have disappeared when I turned down the graphics settings. It depends on your setup with how low you have to turn down the settings. 

Overall, I recommend it for people who enjoy sim racing for the driving experience and don't mind early access. For everyone else, I would wait a little longer.",1708659749,1708659749,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

running a rtx3080, 32gb ddr5 ram and an I9 12900K.
the menu is a stuttering mess, where it says im running at 140fps but with input delay and lag, feels more like 2fps, where just changing simple settings is a chore and time consuming. settings for the race seem to change randomly as if they had a mind of their own. where having it set to a 30 minute race - just for testing - going back into the race setup its at 3 minutes, or 4 hours, or maybe 8, whatever its decided it wants to do. i had some races i loaded in and theres no other cars on the track, or it'll uncheck which car classes are in the race.
i had started the game on its hardest setting, which defaulted to realistic damage, no abs or traction control and then loading into the game, all that has been turned back on, no damage, traction control stuck on etc etc. and then for some reason, while driving a GTE car, my fuel suddenly went wayyyy up, from a estimated 24 laps to an estimated 297 laps.

i originally ran the game at high settings, when i managed to load in, it was running at about 60-70 fps, and then it pegged my gpu and the whole game crashed, and thankfully it was just the game. while lowering the graphical settings to medium granted me an additional 40 fps, it still did not help with stuttering or crashes.

while i would like to comment on the actual gameplay and feel, i have not even been able to enjoy a single lap. as for any pc game, your personal mileage may vary, but for me, i cannot recommend this as an early access title as it will barely even run for me. so for the sake of my time and the health of my gpu, i have refunded.

1. this is effectively rf2 but specifically for WEC 
2. be sure to map the 'force-feedback reset' to a button on the wheel
3. Multi-class AI can be a bit whack, but is overall good and very fast
4. If you let the race start without quali the grid will be ordered completely randomly ie. LMDH behind P2s and GTEs leading off the start (which creates total chaos)

My honest review is that it feels good, it feels very similar to a mix between ACC and AC. The weight of the car is really felt, but you also have to hold a high break pressure through the apex in most corners. An issue that should be fixed with time. And of course, the load times are a bit long... but I recommend to only do 1-2 class races in single-player to reduce the loadtime and stress on the PC. 
currently I can't speak at all to the online because I have yet to race it... soz

Now to what should be added/improved. 
As mentioned above the load times are quite long and in large races it can get quite framey. So I think it would be useful to be able to set the number of cars per class, or even manually choose which cars will be present. 
A fix for the completely random grid order (random order in class like PC2 would work great).
A career mode might be nice, but that will likely come at launch.
The ability to select/set up custom UI

It's a nice evolution of rFactor2 with a focus on a smaller and more detailed set of content. If you've spent time with rF2 it will feel immediately familiar but a step up in pretty much every aspect: physics/handling, FFB, sound, visuals, AI. The quality of life improvements and updated UI are great. I had no problem getting my wheel (Moza) and pedals (Simgrade) set up. The cars and tracks are very detailed and polished, better than the best paid content of rF2. The selection is relatively small as it only covers the 2023 WEC season for now, but what's there is very deep.

But, there are bugs. It's a beta, at best. There are intermittent performance issues and crashes. I've had a couple of crashes-to-desktop. I've had to alt-f4 a couple of times after it stopped responding to input. I've had one or two sessions start and just be a stuttering mess running like a slideshow for the first 30 seconds or so. The menu UI is noticeably sluggish in-session. Loading times are long, outside of private practice. The silver lining is that the issues almost always show themselves immediately after loading into a session, so if you can make it into the car and out of the pit lane it's generally fine.

edit: the first 2 hotfixes have made a big improvement to stability, and I haven't had anymore outright crashes and many fewer issues in general.

To me, right now the fun is worth putting up with / working around the issues, the price is fair for an early access release, and I believe S397 will work the problems out over time. If you don't want to play a beta, come back when it's out of Early Access.

The tyres are now less forgiving over the limit, on wheelspin or lock-up, but you still need to do the good ol' slide into and through a turn, the problem is that now the car is more prone to snapping on you without warning.
While rF2 is likely a bit too forgiving, it at least makes for a more consistent and predictable experience within its own physics weirdness. LMU on the other hand gives you a slap on the wrist when you least expect it to, especially after having done the same move without a problem a few good times before.
After trying the same car and track combination I need to give rF2 the point here, it's the lesser of the two evils.

Then obviously there's the missing content, crashes, freezes, bugs, stuff I'd expect from an early access title anyways so these issues don't bother me at the moment.

Online races I’m getting a solid 115-120fps. Practicing on my own about 150-160fps. Running LMU at MSAA 4x, AA 16x, high settings other than shadows low and the two reflection settings medium. I think it looks real good. 

I would say the fps runs equal to iRacing and maybe 10%-15% less than AMS2. We’ll see if that holds up in wet/night.

First of all I would like to estate clear that I am no Sim Racer Pro or anything like that. I am actually and old dude of 53 years young who loves to enjoy sim racing titles/games.

I want to start by saying that please, do not pay too much attention to those haters reviews that you might find here on Steam. I really do not understand why those people are doing that as if they are going to get recognized or paid by the companies who publish the other titles they are comparing LMU to. And keep in mind that those comparisons are ti games that have around for years already.

Let me tell you that even me with my limited knowledge on computers and tech, I was able to get this game up an running in less than 20 minutes. I have a mid tear computer with and AMD Ryzen 5 5600 6-Core Processor  3.50 GHz, 16 GB of RAM and a Radeon RX 6800 XT and I am able to run all graphics in Ultra except for opponents details. I do turn off or down to very low things like Shadows, Blur, Particles, reflections... etc, and the game performs incredibly well. I also limit FPS to 120 Hz since my monitor does not support more than 144 Hz anyways... 120 fps is more than enough for me. I have not had a single game crash so far and Online as well as single player runs perfectly. I do have to say that I am a bit frustrated with the lag in the menus (setup menu specially). Other than that, FFB is amazing... if you have palyed rF2, then you should know that it basically feels the same, perhaps a little less grainy, same with the physics, they are superb. And not that I want to be controversial here, I do believe there is no other game with better Physics and FFB than rF2... FYI, I play all sims available at the moment except iRacing (due to how expensive it is).

So, if the price tag is not that big of a deal for you, please do give this Sim a try, you will not regret it, besides... we know that S397 will be supporting this title for years to come and by the time the game comes out of EA, I am confident that will be much much better... even if MSG disappears, I am sure another Publisher will come to the rescue of S397.

And the developers are quite communicative on the dedicated Discord and dedicated with fixing issues with the game, having already released two hotpatches since the release of the game two days ago.

This one really has some really nice driving physics and force feedback. Going through the Porsche Curves at le Mans is just one of the examples of the nuances presented by the game when you experience in fine details of how the weight of the car changes.

Besides that, I really like the sound of the game; it sounds crisp and realistic to me. The graphics does it's job well, delivering clean graphics that presents the cars and everything else in a believable manner. 

Have been doing online racing for the most, which is a good experience. You feel safe racing other people, not fearing too many glitches - only the lack of talent from your self or the other racers. The ranking system works fine for now, and it will be interesting to see how it plays out in the future, and what changes and additions that will be made to it along the way.

Content wise this game is a fair deal as well with its (so far) 7 tracks, 7 Hypercars, the LMP2, and the 4 GTE cars (all the content matches the WEC le Mans series of 2023). From what I can understand, additional content will be added, which just adds additional value to it (though one must expect them to raise the price along the way as well).",1708638730,1708638730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I don't think I'll re-list the ways in which it's not perfect - those are being very well documented with a lot of useful and productive feedback, and frankly many complaints are being wiped away with hotfix releases every day since release so far.

What deserves attention is how extremely good the 'big' things are already - the two clearest accomplishments are in the FFB and the sound. Visuals seem to be not only very subjective to the individual, but also heavily dependent on system capability and settings choices, so I'll just say I like the visuals, they're an improvement on RF2, but there will be different experiences of that for everyone.

I used the word 'fascinating' to describe the FFB to a friend today. By day two of Early Access, some great presets are being shared for my Simucube, and I'm sure all the other wheel base brands, and trying one of those coupled with some more details I learned on the Discord channels has put the FFB into rare air. I've never thought I wasn't getting all the quality out of my Simucube, but apparently I wasn't - it had so much more capability to be found. The FFB is intuitive, immediate, and just right in all phases of driving. As a result, I've been steadily increasing the force to much higher percentages than I'm used to using in RF2 and ACC, and it's boosted the immersion a tremendous amount.

I won't try to say much about the sound but my god it is intoxicating. Every car is unique and I have read that a few may not be quite right yet, but as a collection of the small details that add up to being an important source of feedback for driving and control... it's a huge win.

Finally, the driving itself and especially the actual racing with others online is as good as I thought it would be, thanks to what I expected based on RF2 and the Race Control ranked system. 

Fun to think LMU is still not there yet - maybe not even close to what is planned for it - but is already this good on day two. For anyone who's truly an objective, impartial observer, the S397 team is making mincemeat of the cynical and speculative criticism that has been repeated over and over on Discord before there was anything even available to criticize. Their performance this week has been very impressive - massive engagement in discord, organized collection of bug reports, smart prioritization and lightning fast updates.

POSITIVES:
the sound design is incredible, they nailed every car and every sound they make down to their smallest detail and i greatly appreciate that 
driving after u heat ur tires up feels pretty good even on a gamepad [tho its not perfect]
the tracks are well made with their lil bumps and specific quirks reproduced super well
the cars clearly had a lot of care put into them  too

NEGATIVES:
the ai is painfully stupid 
the performance is garbage, ranging from it running normally between 90 - 120 fps on my rtx 4060 to 25 for no reason what so ever 
the anti aliasing options are non existent 
the loading screens are so long you may as well go eat lunch while you wait 
the menus in game and in game ONLY become extremely laggy to the point you cannot use them to change the most basic settings **edit: this has been fixed!**
you also cannot control the menus with a gamepad at all so if u are like me and u want to play while resting your back or whatever you cant cuz you can only control the ui with mouse and keyboard
its missing controller settings that rfactor 2,ACC,project cars 2 and basically every other sim that supports gamepads hae such as filtering settings 
oh and u dont  u dare turn the qualifying session off to get randomized grids, cuz u may end up with an LMGTE on pole and because the ai is stupid that means crashes, lots of them

edit: something i noticed after writing this review, if a session is wet [as it seems to be randomized] the game WILL NOT automatically fit wet tires on your car and again as you cant control the ui with a gamepad, get ready to get out of your chair or couch to change the tires in the menus

The force feedback feels great (after some light tweaking), graphics look good while racing, the racing itself feels awesome, and I haven't encountered major issues like other users have. I definitely recommend this game, especially at the launch price. In my country this game costs a quarter the price of Forza Motorpsort and other new games, so it was an absolute steal for me. Be aware it does not currently have the same amount of content as other games, though the low price offsets this. I do believe in quality over quantity though, and the quality of the racing I’ve experienced was fantastic. I don’t expect 10000 tracks and 50000 different cars, but I really hope Studio 397 eventually delivers a complete package with the extra content that was promised from the start. As it stands I’ll rate the game as follows:
Graphics: 8/10
Gameplay: 8/10
AI Drivers: 7/10 (may be higher if tweaking the settings makes the AI better)
Price: 10/10 
The thrill of being overtaken on the left and right simultaneously by much faster cars: 100/10 (you’ll know what I mean when you experience it).

I have no intentions of badmouthing the developers, players, or anyone else, but I will share the issues I've encountered and tips on resolving the errors or what I did to improve my own experience with the game. My computer has an AMD 5900X, 32GB of RAM, an AMD 6700XT GPU, and a Gigabyte Gen 4 NVME SSD. I race with a Logitech G27 steering wheel.
Issues encountered:
1) Game randomly crashes to desktop after a race loads. This does not happen every race, but does happen quite a bit. 
2) AMD's Radeon overlay pops up and obstructs the screen. It’s as though something in the game triggers the overlay and it persistently stays on screen. I eventually found a way around this by  Alt+Tabbing to the desktop then opening AMD Radeon from the System Tray. Once AMD Radeon opens the overlay disappears in game. 
3) RAM usage is up to 70% of the 32GB, possibly more. This is quite high, much higher than any other games I’ve played. Hopefully optimisations will reduce the RAM usage.
4) Micro stutter appears when racing with other cars on a packed grid. Frame rates go down to around 67 FPS and don't dip much below, but micro stutter is visible. It's not enough to disrupt the game though. The Le Mans Ultimate website states the following workaround: “Rarely, users may experience very frequent stutters in gameplay. If you experience this please visit the root folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\LeMansultimate\UserData\player\settings.json and set “Record To Memory”:true, (change from false to true).” I have not had time to try this yet, but in the heat of racing I hardly notice the micro stuttering. 
5) Race lengths do not follow what is set. If a race is set to 18 minutes in the setup, when the race starts the race length just seems random. On the official website this issue is known. The website provides the following workaround (I haven't tested this yet): ""The minimum length of a race session in quick configuration remains the same value as the user’s last race (this can be remedied by going to advanced options or clicking to increase the value before returning to the length you desire).""
6) The AI drivers seem quite dumb for the first few corners of a race. Any packed race initially results in many accidents in the first few corners, and cars coming to a complete halt in the middle and sides of the track. I don’t follow real racing enough to say if this is normal or not, but it feels overdone. Perhaps changing the AI difficulty and other settings would prevent this from happening.
7) Loading times are long initially, but subsequent loading times seem to become shorter and shorter.
General tips:
- The force feedback feels heavy initially. With a Logitech G27 there is a force feedback deadzone for a few degrees around the centre. When the feedback strength is high making a series of turns feels horrible. It results in feeling the first turn, then not feeling anything once the force feedback deadzone is reached, then feeling the second turn, and the cycle repeats. The combined effect can easily throw you off when cornering and reduces accuracy drastically. I lowered the Force Feedback Strength to 70% and this made the steering feel lighter. I also turned the Minimum Steering Torque force up to 5. The combination made the force feedback deadzone much less apparent and my steering accuracy was much, much higher. I assume this workaround will also apply to other Logitech wheels like the G25, G29, G920, and G923.

[*]Requires still a lot of tinkering in .ini or .json files outside of the game to set all things as desired.

One aspect that is significantly better than any other sim I've played (and I've played them all) is multi class AI. They handle traffic significantly better than AC, ACC, and any other AI in any sim I've used. 

One complaint I keep seeing is the lack of tracks -- keep in mind that ACC started out with just one track. ACC has always been limited by the fact it's licensed by SRO and can only have content from SRO promoted series like GTWC, IGTC, British GT, FFSA, etc. Well in this case this game is licensed by the ACO and that opens the possibility of European and Asian Le Mans, Le Mans Cup, and more which gives access to nearly as many tracks as ACC has. It's taken years for ACC to get to the point it is at now, and it will take years of support from the community before this sim can get there as well.

My background...
I might be a bit biased as my favourite motorsport category is endurance racing, and my favourite cars are GT cars and prototypes. 24 hours of Le Mans, as well as Sebring, Daytona (IMSA, so not included here) and Spa are some of my favourite tracks/events.

The good!
I set up a race against the AI, starting in the early evening before it got dark, and kept driving for a few hours into the darkness of Le Mans. And what a magic feeling it was! The lighting, the sounds, the feel of racing at Le Mans is really good, even in this early access version. The immersion is fantastic, I forgot about time and just kept driving. I had to try a hybrid prototype, LMH, so I decided to give the Toyota a go. The hybrid sounds are amazing during braking and acceleration, and the engine sounds incredibly good and accurate compared to real life onboard footage, at least in my opinion. And everytime I passed an LMP2 it sounded absolutely amazing and accurate. If I had closed my eyes I could without a doubt said it was an Oreca LMP2 for sure, just by the sound alone. For a while I was racing in a small group of LMH cars (AI), and it was incredible. The light from the cars, brake lights, some trackside lights, etc, it looked really good in my opinion. How the car felt to drive, racing against the AI and passing traffic, fantastic immersion, I absolutely loved it! If I would've had the Radio Le Mans commentators in the background it would have been just like watching the real 24 hours of Le Mans, except I was driving. 

And the not so good...
This is definitely early access. I can't set up a 1 hour long race, because if I do it changes to 20 hours when the race starts. Also, if you just want to jump into a race without practice or qualifying, good luck! The grid positions seems to be completely random. GT cars might start first with a mix of LMP2's and LMH's, and it causes a lot of trouble when the AI is trying to make a lot of passes at the start of the race with such a mix of slow and fast cars. I can't find a grid position option/setting, except for the player, but not for the AI cars. So far the solution has been to set up a qualifying session + race, then skip qualifying, that seems to sort by class even if no cars has set a qualifying time. Also, in one session I couldn't press Escape, nothing happened. My keyboard definitely worked, other mapped keyboard settings worked in-game, but I couldn't press Esc to return to garage, access settings or exit the session. Basically, the UI and stability of the game needs some work. Initially the FFB also felt weird, but I got it working, not sure what setting actually made a difference here.

So, is it worth it?
In my opinion, yes! Especially if you love endurance racing and Le Mans (but there are other tracks here as well). The immersion is like nothing else, with accurate liveries and cars. This is definitely a serious competitor for any simulator that offers endurance racing. The driving and FFB (when it works) feels good, although could be tweaked a bit for my liking, but I mostly drive in iRacing, so thats what I'm used to. The sounds are amazing, the lights and visuals are surprisingly good as well! I am running this on the ""high"" preset with a 7800X3D, RTX 4080, 32GB DDR5-6000 and a Samsung 990 Pro SSD, without performance issues on a 144Hz 3440x1440 monitor. It does occasionally have some ""rF2 stutters"", but otherwise it runs great. There are definitely bugs and issues that needs to be sorted out by the devs, but this is early access, so I know this is not a finished game yet, and I'm not going to compare it to something like iRacing, ACC, etc. as that wouldn't be fair at this point.

One of the most crucial part of a sim is the settings. everyone has their own preferences when it comes to how a games feel like when they use a rig. And being able to make driving as enjoyable as we want is what makes people wanna play again. and right now , things arent so great in term of settings. 

first of all , let me talk about the settings menu in general... that shit is slower than microsoft explorer, settings takes a long ass time before updating when changing settings during a session and it quickly become frustrating when trying to set everything up for the first time.  In my 3.4 hrs of play , at least half of it was spent in the settings menu trying to make things feel good to me.

which leads me to my second point. the force feedback settings, everythings feels too light ,i keep trying to fix it but i just end up loosing patience because everything takes too long to load. when going slow and/or turning (when the wheel should be at his heaviest) there's no force , i could with only my index rotating the wheel. going off track feels the same as on driving on the asphalt, at first i thought ""maybe there's a setting for it that is by default set at the lowest , no there isn't... when you loose the rear of the car you can't even feel it , which makes it hard to correct and easy to spin.  

also , idk if this is because of the cars but theres no power steering?? the wheel doesn't come back to place by it self which is awful


my final point is the camera settings... well , the lack of it, because the only options are the camera type and the fov... thats it..

Cons during first run:

Fast loading times;
No laggy, slow menus;
Good FPS and quality (medium and High settings on 1920x1080 on my 32"" TV as screen) also didn't change a thing during the 3 hours I spent in

During racing on Lemans with Glickenhaus LMDH:

I had 0 Force FeedBack on my G29. I found it weird because the only feedback I had was at 220kph and the wheel shaked like crazy. Then I tried to fix this issue and have FFB all the times to have a decent gaming experience.

After 1.5hours, testing and driving for like 1km (ingame), and took me like 4 laps at Lemans to get it right, I decided to do a AI race with some AI. Just to test if the FPS were good and I felt confortable with racing online at all (not even a medium sim racer here). Also the menus were laggy and slow like people were talking about. Just that time. Online the menus were fine.

When I tried to go to an AI race, when loading to the race, it crashed my game, and when I got back, I could finally get in the AI race, but my FFB settings were gone. The values were the same, but my wheel was like in stock values (when I first got in). I also checked the .ini file and the values were correct, made a copy of it and decided to get in again.

FFB was gone, only at 220kph again, same issue as before. Also the AI was messy, no radar or chief to tell, you have a car on your left or right, they don't care if you are on your lane, they simply run you over (Hi Forza Motorsport).
Took me some time to get another values right, a bit different from what I had when I tried for those 1.5 hours, but I could at least do a lap or 2 with the AI.

AI simply don't care, crash into me, and made me spin and I flipped my car. But at least I knew the game ran fine without any fps drop (as far as I could tell).

1st Online Race:

Then I tried to go online. It's a pain, you need to have another account for what ever purpose, and then activate it. Then you can get online.
You have similar system to ""iRenting"", with licenses and SR (Safety Rating), and you need to level up to unlock all 2 next levels to compete in all races.
Then after all that done, I tried to join in Tsukuba (never raced there before, probably only in GT4 lol), and you have practice servers. All of them were full (only 6 of them). Had to wait for 5-10min until I found one clear. Tried and my game gave me an error and I had to restart the game. After the restart, the practice matches were full, and the race was about to start. Tried to join, didn't let me ... restarted again. Then I could join in, not sure what was going on (if Qualy or something) but I was in the pits. Had to setup the ignition and engine start, and then I went to the track. It went not as smooth as I thought, the car spins alot. But tried to manage and actually felt good.

During the race, after qualified 12, was chaotic but people respected for being a new game. People spun alone because no grip at all, people failing braking points, etc ... felt a better chaotic than FM2023. Even without a spotter.

So after the race I decided even after like 2.5hours I spent in game trying to fix FFB, I give it a positive review. I had what I was looking for, in this game.

So if you are willing to wait to the game to be polished, sure, but this game felt very good online, even with all the drama around this race I had earlier.

After watching some more videos, I decided to try it again and I am glad I did. 

Once on track and driving, wow, what a experience. The driving feel and ffb are great once tyres get up to temps. First few laps may feel weird but once those tyres come in, it begins to make sense. 

The sound of the cars is top notch, something I think is a big part of making these games feel like I am inside the cars. 

Graphics aren't going to blow anyone away IMO but they are good. 

I have limited FPS to 70 for now just to run higher settings without drops. They are still there but once the track/shaders load, it seems to stabilise.

Still haven't played much but now I have good frames, I can see the potential the game has. Will give it a good drive in the next few days but I can see this coming my go to sim from now on.

im currently torn between recommending this game or not as it really comes down to the individual person.
if you're a person who likes a racing game where you can just chill and have fun racing and don't really mind there not being a career mode of some sort then this game is definitely for you. however i must warn you, as of right now there is A LOT of things the devs have to work on.
here is some of the things i have noticed:

- not being able to customize your races as the game kinda just ignores your customizations. for example setting the lenght of a race to lets say 30 minutes or so. In my case it chose to 12 hours automatically even tho i had chose the lenght to be 30 minutes
- you can't choose the amount of cars you want to race against as of right now because the game also ignores that
- get ready for a whole lot of spinning out no matter how good you drive! sometimes its like there's not traction or stability control on at all (or maybe its just me who's a bad driver lol) 
- the AI is INCREDIBLY slow 
- the game happens to crash sometimes as well but in my case its very rare as mine have only crashed 2 or 3 times in the 11 hours i've been playing it as of writing this review :) 
- the loading times. you can go get some lunch while you load in on a track :D

but of course there's also a few things to look forward to! 
- the overall feeling of the game is very awesome
- the devs have NAILED the car sounds in this game
- the tracks (and hopefully more will be added in the future) 
- the variety of cars available (and hopefully more will be added in the future)

now. If you're a person who likes a online racing game with some sort of a story mode/career mode i sadly can't recommend this game as both of the things are not yet available but hopefully they will get the online mode up and running soon and hopefully they will also add a career mode in the near future as the game can get boring at some point even for a type like myself who likes the chill racing games.
that was about it, i do hope some of you find this helpful and yeah im already waiting very excited for the next updates in the near future as i think this game have A LOT of potential. devs, please don't mess this up! :D",1708553312,1708553641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Iam came only for career modes, like F1, or story like Assassins Creed. I dont care about online at all, so i played only Race Weekend.

From bad things. I 6 years old PC and got little bit slow menus in race, gamepad not work in menus, and got one crash when tried drive with 60 opponents at Sarthe circuit.

 Simulation not working right. One time got fastest Q time, pressed next session and computer got me last (got 2 sec gap over 2nd place). In race finished in 1st place at Le Mans, clearly remember 4 Porsche cars behind me, but in end results on e Porsche 2nd, Ferrari 3rd, Caddilac 4th.
It leads to next problem for me, opponents performance. Toyota cars regularly out of Top5.

But if can close your eyes on these problems, be patient with menus, i say go for it, cause game  have beautiful cars and tracks, good functions in MFD, its really very detailed.

Its clear that the only reason it is released is because Studio397 ran out of money since it is far from polished, however i still chose to give it a positive rating because i feel that, despite the flaws, there is a good game in the making. 

Lets start with the positive then.
The game feels good. Physics are fine, sound is great and graphics are good. The game is not too heavy to run even on good settings and the details are nice. After numerous excursions into the gravel pit the car got very dirty, a nice detail. Lighting is also nice. The menus are sleek and somewhat intuitive, and i havent experienced any crashes so far, as other have reported. The cars (as far as i've tested) feel distinct, and overall is fun to drive! Difficult for sure, but rewarding. It is however when you go from quali to a race, that the flaws of this product really start to creep in.

First things first, the AI is crap. They drive like maniacs with no regard for themselves or the player, its like you dont even exist (one even tried to climb over top my vehicle at some point) and they stutter and rubber band like crazy, even tough my fps is good. Its honestly not fun to drive against. The AI draw distance is also very weak, but maybe i missed a setting in the options menu. Talking about menus, they feel slow. Like they run on 5 fps. And then the loading times, i can go make a sandwich while a session is loading. Odd, as other games on the same scale dont have this issue. 

All in all, all the rfactor components seem to work fine, its the things around it that are lacking. The driving experience is fun however, and i'm on the fence about returning it and waiting for updates, or continue playing for what it is. If you are not sure either, id say you can wait a couple of months before buying, hopefully they have fixes some of the issues, but for so far the core of the game is good. Like i said, mixed feelings.


UPDATE:
So i did end up playing more. AI gets worse with every race. Besides they also dont feel ballanced well. They destroy me in qualifying by severy secconds, but in the race i breeze past them like they are standing still. Catching hypercars in lmp2's, and clock fastest lap overall by 5 seconds, odd. Other than that the online is buggy to get into. All in all, more of the same, driving is still fun tho.",1708530539,1708548953,True,6,0,0.568345367908477783,0,True,False,True

I would summarize these main points:

Strengths:

Good content available for an early access game, it already has a variety of cars and tracks made in high quality, satisfactory for a product of this price, unlike the original Rfactor 2.

Positive or negative:

Force Feedback and Handling: It's a bit strange, sometimes it seems like you can feel the car and have total control over the steering until suddenly you lose it and don't quite understand why. Something like when it's good, it's good, when it's bad, it's bad. Somewhat inconsistent. The Super GT video published on February 20th on YouTube explains it better.

Negative points:

The camera is very far away for realism sake. An additional camera option on the car dashboard would be very welcome. The HUD's tachometer does not indicate the right time to change gears, unlike the tachometer inside the car. That's why it's not so good to drive with cameras outside the car. It doesn't seem good to play with a single monitor that isn't that big (mine is 27 inches).

A little heavier than the original Rfactor 2. I do not have the premium content from R2 with the clues from there that are present here for reference. But compared to older R2 content, this game is heavier. FPS drops considerably on the Le Mans track. And it seems to happen both because it demands more from the GPU and because it demands more from the CPU as well.

Very slow loading times.

I consider that there is still a lot of work to be done in optimization to avoid such long loading times and the marked difference in performance on the Le Mans track, which is the main attraction of this game.",1708547108,1708547108,False,3,1,0.538679540157318115,0,True,False,True

 Seems aligned on what I ve read | seen as review.  
- Force feedback is really great, 
- cockpit sounds are on top as well.  Graphic are ok and what you can expect today.. still today more eyes candy on AMS2 for outside world ( maybe less aliasing on L.U.  .. tbc ). 

 With my 4090 I can max everything at 2K and run at 144 FPS. ( my display only support 60hz at 4k .. which I was able to reach as well , but wheel respond on display was a little bit sluggish .. dunno if this my hw limit or the game ). 

 Wheel and pedals were assigned without any issue. 
 Wasn t able to map keyboard key for input. 
 Wasn t able to select triple displays setup through the GUI.  I will try later through ini file.  

your driving style have to be more chirurgical than AMS2 ( never tried Rfactor or iRacing ) and you don t have the feeling to drive a brick like ACC.  you can really feel the car handling improving lap after lap ( from box cold car ).   
Tried only Spa which one of each car category.  
LMP2  was the one I was able to push earlier on laps more instinctively.  

Brake's responses feels more ''racing'' than AMS2 ( totally subjective i agree ).  Tried the game with '' pro '' options.  

Rain seems at early stage on graphic side ( no spray from other car, very limited rain droplets on windshield ans side windows).  

My takeaway is this game have a lot of potential .. will see in future .... What I love from AMS2 is the car diversity.. here we have hyper Car, LMP2 et GTE ... by default all three categories are on track which is nice 

Session are very slow to load on first time .. maybe they build some files on the first time you select one session profile ( or track ).  Going from 2k to 4k was also very long loading ... 

can t wait to try MP ... regarding with people attitude on the lobby it could be heaven or hell .. even more than AMS2 I think .
Didn t had any issue with IA ... didn t play with their parameters neither

I entered 2 races at 90% difficulty and not only were the AI cars insanely slow but in both races the entire field pit after lap 1. No clue what that's about but I had fun just in practice.

I decided to try online and that was equally broken. Tried to enter a beginner race and the lobby obviously had a bunch of people that entered the race but all practice servers were completely full so I couldn't practice. So I thought alright I'll just wait 10 min for the race to start. Well the timer counted down, I was registered for the race, and nothing happened. I couldn't click to join, couldn't do anything. So I guess I'll wait a bit longer to play since I cant enter a good AI race or an online race period. So that's why I do recommend the game but as of now it launched in early access almost completely unplayable aside from single player practice sessions.

Update 3: 

Reversing my opinion. After a few hours of setup I think I have something quite good. I found a decent balance for visuals and FPS (2080TI on a Super Ultrawide). 

Driving experience is good as expected, the UI is slightly better after the update. Still quite a few crashes.

--- 
Update 2:

Starting to have some success, the UI is still sluggish in session, but faster in the main menu when vsync is turned on.

Update 1:

If you are having FFB issues with nothing in the middle and extreme at the sides, toggle the ""Invert FFB"" option in settings.

To speed up the menu: ALT+Tab to refresh the pages (not a great solution, but it works).

This game is great, it has a very good format, che cars are amazing and the tracks are high detail, for it's Early Access this is a great game.
It has that rFactor 2 and Assetto Corsa Competizione mix and i love it.
The cars tend to spin out very easily in first and second gear but thatìs ok.

The 24 hour cycle is great, it shows the work.

A lot is still missing! Like the optimisation of the game it becomes very laggy with all the cars and it would be nice tp have an FPS limiter. Reaply mode absent, lagging when you enter the practice session interface before heading out on the track and you cannot save your sessions

The driving experience is already excellent, the sounds are superb, and I've never had an easier time setting up my wheel and pedals and peripherals in a brand new racing game.

The ball is entirely in the dev's court now. If they update this game frequently and listen to what the players want, it could become a really great game.

At the moment, Studio 397 are using the community to ""brute force"" the game, so bugs that hinder the experience and emersion can be patched. Therefore, if you want to play and help the developers find as many bugs as possible, you Should buy the game.

It all comes down to whether or not you need to play the game as early as possible.

From my understanding, the physics is quite good. You definitely feel the car going through the corners, and when you flat-spot the tyres, the entire car vibrates.

---------------------------------------------------
The immersive racing experience in single player mode.
The physics is really, really, really good.
Driving is challenging and requires learning.
FFB is communicative (Fanatec DD).
Graphics run well on a 3060 at medium to high settings.
The AI makes mistakes, fights for position, and is well calibrated.
Hypercars, LMP2s, and GTEs are more enjoyable to drive than GT3s.
I appreciate the sound design very much.
I am looking forward to multiplayer; it seems promising with daily and weekly race programs and driver rank matching (not tried yet, and I hope for a growing player base).
I like it as ACC with different car classes and much better AI.

I don't like, but its in early access, so no big deal:
---------------------------------------------------
Close proximity arrows or radar are not implemented.
The spotter does not work.
There are a few bugs in racing mechanics here and there.
The mid-race saving functionality is not available.
There is no pit crew animation.
The loading times are long.
Undertray sparks are not visible (only in the look-behind view).

Pros
- simple to set up!!!!!! NO BLOATED CRAP! I was driving around a track within a few minutes of settings tweaking
- controller works right away, easy to rebind stuff and generally find what you want settings wise
- sounds great
- tracks are good AF in their modelling; Sebring WILL kill you
- handling is not bad on controller, easy to adapt to (but not as good as it could be imo)
- online servers have good connection (based off the 1 race I did, no netcode issues or stuff like that)

Cons
- currently, changing settings while paused at speed will crash the game with the car going at light speed lmao
- vibration is directly tied in to controller force feedback (but I do love having controller FFB!)
- setting menus are a bit laggy and can cause the game to hang/close itself sometimes
- long loading times

Ofc lots of bugs have already been noted and it is going to be messy in places its early access - people should stop expecting the world 12 seconds in, but after my first online race fighting for a podium on the last lap I can say I had a lot of fun, which is what games are about - I really hope the studio sticks with this and keeps fixing/adding stuff over time because this so far is promising!!!

And yes, I do have concerns that this will never be finished owing to MSG's perilous financial standing. But there is a huge amount of promise here, and I really hope that S397 are given the time and money needed to finish it.

LMU is essentially rF2.5. A lot of the settings in rF2 carry over. You can configure triple screens and (rudimentary) VR by using rF2 settings copied into the the correct .ini files. The UI is leagues ahead of rF2's. It's not great, but it's servicable. It looks much nicer, but suffers some of the same UX foibles from it's older brother.

The graphics are (for the most part) great. The tracks look good and the lighting looks good. The car interiors and, specifically, the materials, are gorgeous. Sebring looks bumpy (and feels even moreso), though there could be a greater variation in track-side objects (specifically the motorhomes). Fuji does need a bit of a tart up, but S397 have said that it will  be getting one soon.

Audio is epic. The sound of the regen in the 499P is absolutely spot-on. The engines all sound exactly as they should. The only issue is the crash sounds, which are lacking somewhat. But then that's an issue in just about every game I've ever played.

The attention to detail is great as well - they have the correct tyre warmer rules that the WEC used last season. Namely: there are no tyre warmers at any track except Le Mans. And trying to get heat into the tyres can be tricky, as it is in real life (remember the 499P crashing at Spa on cold tyres? Yeah, that's very repeatable here!). Once the tyres do have heat though, they feel great. On my TS-XW you can feel the tyres loading up. You can feel when you've entered a corner a bit hot and get some understeer or four-wheel sliding.

And now to the star of the show: The LMP2 is an absolute blast. So incredibly rewarding. Easy to drive, but difficult to get the best out of. It makes total sense though how rich old people are able to jump in one and not die but also see how there's such a pace disparity. I fucking love driving it. It makes the iRacing one feel numb and boring. It drives how it looks when you watch the real ones. They do that lateral bouncing over kerbs. You can feel the tyres loading up. You can really feel the tyres coming up to temp, and you need to work at them to keep them in range. But not too much, else you'll cook them. It's forgiving, but only to a point. Can get away with a lot more than you can in the iRacing version; it allows you to get the tail out a bit and not die. It might just be the best and most fun car I've ever sim raced. It's amazing.

There's a lot to like here, but there's also a lot to be weary of. Yes, it's early access, so some of it can be expected. But some of the same rF2 bugs are present (disappearing force-feedback namely) which is a bit irritating. Navigating the settings menu in a race session is borderline impossible due to the lag, but they do work fine when not in a race session. Performance can be very hit-or-miss, with massive dips in FPS occasionally. For the most part though, it does run fairly well. It doesn't do any FSR/DLSS though, so extracting extra performance isn't that simple yet.

If you're happy to spend some time fettling settings and playing around in .ini files and can tolerate some random crash-to-desktops, then I fully recommend this game. If you're not, then maybe wait a bit. S397 have a potential gem on their hands. Time will tell if MSG let them polish it.",1708519287,1708519382,True,24,0,0.689288020133972168,0,True,False,True

Well, I usually don't write reviews, BUT I have to say it's worth to do it for this game!

I was really excited for the release - and yes - even if it is Early Access. 

So, after a couple of hours playing that game and trying to find solutions for the basic setup - especially for the FFB - (I have a Moza R16) I was kinda dissapointed because I thought I managed to get it working, but it still doesn't. Due to a missleading description in an infobox. 
Solution: I've searched for the LMU support Discord channel and asked some of my question. (Should have done that earlier) xD
It didn't take longer than 10minutes to solve all of my problems. One or two were already solved by the community in a community support channel and the other ones were directly solved by the Developers itself. 

Now, I have to say: Damn, this game is fckn AWESOME! - Yes it is early access, and yes there are still some minor errors, but it is Day 1, and tbh, I can't understand why people are complaining about it. I guess the major issue of people complaining, is that they are not able to use the support. 
!!!BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I SEE A SUPPORT THAT IS ACTUALLY A SUPPORT THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE!!!
And with something like this as a really really good foundation - we as a COMMUNITY - have to work together with the developers to make this game bigger and bring it to a final release with awesome content. Nothing will happen if people just say: game is shit because they are no able to get it working without giving any information or even trying to find a solution. Because the developers want to work with us and want to tweak this game in a direction we want to have it.

In conclusion: 
I really have to say that it is woth playing it. And as I already said, after fixing some minor problems the game is just awesome, especially for the stage where it is right now. The physics are very good and completey understandable. It doesn't feel arcady and is a real Simulation in my opinion. FFB is also really good and you can really feel what the car is doing. Moreover, I guess we, as a community, can make this game big and even better than ACC to get it on the top of the list of Sim racing games.

To come to an end,
 Great work 397! Congratulations for a decend start and Day1!  Please keep the hard work with the community and your support up. Don't let everything fade away after a few weeks! Because this is not what we need and you want.

I know it is Early access, but there are a few things that should have been fixed already... in rf2.
I know the studio have some great devs with a lot of potential! but I would suggest to wait a bit on this one.

THE GOOD:
- the model of multiplayer is great! daily / weekly events is a must have on modern racing games
- to have a official license is fun
- the DNA of the game (rFactor 2) is good and have a lot of potential!

THE BAD:
- really poor optimization
- FFB is a disaster for low spec wheels (like the G29)
- the UI is even worse than the original rF2
- lots and lots of bugs... same stuff you've got on the rF2

Only track/car I played so far was Le Mans with the Peugeot 9X8

Initial impressions are good, the FFB feels nice and the sound is great. I use a MOZA R12 and the game instantly recognized it and did button bindings which was nice. It was fun to play around with the hybrid boost regen and power, nice little detail.

Graphics are good, the FPS is weird. I've had times where its over 60 and times where its just 20 for a whole race, kind of difficult. My GPU is a 3070 running ultra-wide 1440p so I wasn't expecting huge numbers from a new game (VRAM kinda limits in most games). The graphics settings are just what was defaulted on boot-up, I'm gonna try the High preset, maybe it will work better.

The elephant in the room is obviously the super laggy menus when in a session. Hopefully it gets patched because I was pulling out of sessions to change my settings. I haven't had any crashes (knock on wood) so far like other reviews have mentioned (5800X CPU and 32gb ram, game is on SSD)

The solo driving experience is nice, I mainly got this game to play around with the LMDh cars so its exactly what I wanted. Once the bugs are ironed out and VR support is added I think it will be a great game. I recommend getting it, if you have crashes, return it, but if not just wait through the bugs, I think its worth it.

Kind of important since the tyres are frozen for the first 2-3 laps. That being said, the LMP2 and GTEs dont suffer from this dead FFB issue, only the Hypercars. Very strange

Also, for some reason, at low speeds (in the pits) the FFB feels super grainy, feels like my wheel base is set in sandpaper. Not an issue once you get going, but really takes away from the driving experience. tried all sorts of settings but couldnt sort it out. Wheelbase is a Simagic Alpha Mini

Frame drops can be expected. was not an issue on spa or LM or portimao. but was very frequent on bahrain and sebring night. PC build > 5800x, 4080, 32gb DDR4, game installed on Crucial P3 2TB ssd

Brakes are closer to IRacing (more finesse needed, trail braking needed or you will lock your brakes) than ACC (brake mashing simulator). Although i would say FFB and driving experience of both Iracing and ACC are better than LMU in its current state

driving feel makes or breaks a sim for me. i dont really care about in-game content or weather or online experience as much. Apples to Apples, the 963 and Cadillac in IRacing feel leagues better than in LMU. Much more communicative and intuitive to drive. Challenging to drive but not prohibitive. In LMU you cant really feel where the grip is, not much sensation of downforce which also affects the brakes because you dont know when to start trailing.

Right now, Iracing and ACC driving experience > LMU driving experience

ACC, F123, and myriad other racing games support G29s out of the box, or at the very least, the settings menus make it easy to tweak. Not only is LMU's FFB soft to the point of comedy, but changing it involves navigating a menu with so much input latency it feels like you might be tweaking strength ratios 1% at a time from Mars. 

After 45 minutes of clicking every option up and down individually to try and diagnose my problem, only to have to reset to default, which also changes all the settings on other pages including wheel max angle, then clicking the button individually to bring it back down to 360, then try tweaking another setting to no avail, I gave up and asked for the first refund I have ever requested on Steam.

Once you are able to get it running with your antivirus (common issue) it seems to set up quite well (although slow).
At this stage the selection of cars and tracks is a bit light but early access will do that!
The AI race you as though you don't exist and are much faster (even in a straight line side by side with similar corner exit)
With the standard setup the rear end is always a bit slippy and will come around at the slightest chance (very reminiscent of early AMS2).
The tracks seems OK (only used Spa and LeMans at this stage) and the choices for setting a race seem OK at this stage except for # of competitors is strangely missing.
Handling and audio seem OK.
My first entry into the car cockpit put the vision on the left screen for straight ahead using triples, but switching camera views (there are many to find the right one) sorted that out.
As it's early access I'll give it a thumbs up for now (look at how well AMS2 developed from early access but this is S397 so, maybe......)
Hopefully the future is bright, but right now I'd prefer AMS2 with Endurance pack but I'll keep working this and see how it goes. :)

Being an early access game it has all sorts of issues which I'm sure they'll fix with time, but the core gameplay of driving is really solid. The audio in particular is mindblowingly phenomenal. I use a Fanatec DD 8NM and quite enjoy the FFB offered in the game. The handling of the cars feels great, and driving a Hybrid without assists is a fun challenge! 

Due to the issues there is a fair amount of friction that can stand in the way between you and getting to what you want to do which is drive the car in a race or online. They've already got a fairly extensive list of known issues on their forums that I'd imagine they are prioritizing pushing out fixes for. 

The absence of key features such as Career, Co-op, and VR is definitely disappointing, but after almost an hour of gameplay I am very excited for what this game has to offer not only now with the great driving, but in the future when the rest of the features are added. 

If you're OK with a bit of friction getting in the way and making things a bit difficult, whats there to enjoy is a lot of fun. I definitely recommend getting the game. Obviously, this friction isn't for everyone, and the key features missing are genuinely important, so I don't expect the early access experience will be what everyone wants and that a lot of people will wait. 

I chose not to wait, because I really like the core concept of what the devs are going for, and I've wanted a game like this for a really long time. By buying now I am letting the devs know with my money that I support the game, their vision, and that I want to see it succeed. It would be such a shame, with the current state of Motorsport Games, for this wonderful endeavor by Studio 397 to be hindered. At least I can look back, regardless of how they are able to handle early access, and be satisfied that I did what I could to support it, instead of being filled with regret of doing nothing by waiting X time for it to be finished. 

Also they will be raising the price throughout early access as they add more features. I think they were originally wanting the full release to cost $50-60 USD?

In conclusion, for the current price, the current state of Early Access, even in an update or 2, is absolutely worth it IMO. Know what you are getting yourself into, know what you can do and what you can't, and if it's something you want, go ahead and get it as it is a lot of fun.

No issues. 
Then I started doing the practice/qualy/race and as soon as I started skipping sessions the game started to crash. 

The first time it crashed was when I started a race at Sebring and then after a couple of laps I wanted to restart the race. It went back to the screen where you can select to watch or to drive, but it would not allow me to select drive, just watch. But it wouldn't even respond to clicking on watch. Then it crashed. 

Then I tried several times at Sebring skipping either the practice or qualy and it would crash. After the 3rd or 4th time that the game crashed, I would not be able to open the game again until I stopped and restarted Steam. 

Then in another race, I had to take a call and crashed at the turn 1 at Sebring, then hit ""I"" for the AI to take over while I was talking on the phone, but the AI crashed right away and stopped the car. 

In another time, it seems like it didn't like the setting with a minimum time for a race at Sebring, as it would crash as soon as I hit Continue to start the race weekend.

No crashes for me yet. I appreciate the small details so far. When I’m in menu, my Fanatec wheel shows an “LM” on the wheel display. 

Only driven the Cadillac Lmdh at Le Mans so far but it feels good once getting the brake balance dialed in.  It has its own feel but it drives well and FFB is intuitive.

This is another one like Forza Motorsport that had all kinds of hype and the trailers looked amazing, but then when you finally get in the game t falls far short on pretty much every aspect. Graphically someone else said it basically looks like  mod for rF2 and I think they hit the nail on the head. The trailers had this sim looking better than AC or ACC. In reality it looks more like the original rFactor. I have a pretty healthy system and so I have all graphic settings maxed out. It looks like something from 10-15 years ago. On top of that, the controls are lacking in that there are some things not included (like a hand brake or seat positioning) that just aren't there. It is somewhat limited in car selection and VERY limited in track selection. I also have to go in and change some settings with every race. It seemed like every time I got in a car I had to tell it I wanted private practice and clear weather. And it was totally ncessary to have a private practice because if there was any AI on the track, framerates dropped dramatically. By myself I could get consistent 70-80 fps or more with maxed out graphics. With AI, that number dropped down to 10-20 fps at the most. I've heard the AI is terrible but I wouldn't know cuz I could never get even remotely decent frame rates if I had AI on the track. The replay graphics were also terrible. There were lots of graphical artifacts and unwanted transparencies, and the cars all looked like they were sped up to like, 1.5X. Very bad. 
The GTE cars drove very well, as did the LMP2 cars. They hypercars all drove like they were on ice. Also, some of the in car audio (engine sounds) were just plain awful.

Initial thoughts
Look - The game is very pretty and runs on a triple screen out of the box. There is no VR yet. But this is on the things to do list.
Stability - I had a single crash to desktop in my 8 hours of play. But this could be on my end as I was doing things with other programs outside of this game. I can imagine a 10 hour race being lost would be devastating.
Wheel Support - I had no issues with connecting my Fanatec DD wheel and peddles. Though it was not automatically picked up like in other games.
Features - There are still a number of lacking features in the game. But it is early access and feels bare bones so far.
Content - With 6-7 tracks and less than a dozen cars. The initial early access release feels empty. But they are high quality.
Race Feel - The Proto2's feel great on track. And the GT-E Porsche  feels good. The Hypercar Peurgeot was to much to handle for my little skill.

Issues
Changing race length takes far too long and could have 30 minute increments for adjustment over 1 minute.
Opponent AI needs work. I have been taken out far to many times from overly aggressive AI. And have rear ended the AI several dozen times, when they break far to much for corners. These can be adjusted with AI aggressive/AI skill sliders. I feel a Proto2 should not be able to overtake Hypercar's, let alone lap them in a race due to pure corner speed. I will have to play with both of these settings to see if this changes my initial impression. This review was from base settings.

One of my biggest annoyances, was the enormous loading time for the race. When using a 5th Gen M.2. drive you get used to speed. But this like loading windows from a 4800rpm HDD.

(Inserted Edit):The Loading times.... it's a killer... I feel I'm getting ancient waiting for a track same as RF2.

The good is that it's focused in a series of motorsport instead of a general simcade

The game retains the same usability problems as it's predecesors even the inability to rightly setup your control or wheel (where's the speed sensitivity?!!! it has too much controller input even for a g pro), a more streamlined settings page could help... A LOT!

The Graphics... well, what would you expect from an elder engine?... should be nice to see many more photorealistic effects , mhmh did I mentioned something about older .mas files? whatever, ACC or Rennsport Beta with it's UE5 are doing better!!! I expected you to do better!!! ah!!! I forgot it! the intro!!... no words... good for a beta test I guess...

When racing the delta lap reaches up to 9.999 or -9.999 seconds (what about more or less than 10?), the setup page is ok if you know what means each adjustment!, but believe me or not no one will understand what means P4 in a Wing, add more explanation for newcomers (don't be lazy make me feel i'm using something new) and of course more clear with it's physical effects on vehicles.

FFB is ok... or it seems so...

Sound, the sound... another major issue... it desyncs and sometimes I need audio feedback on my skidding tires... I feel the force, I see the trail but sometimes I lost the skidding sound to know if i'm still on tire limits (don't make feel I'm a Jedi trusting only what I can feel LOL).

For the newcomers or the iRacers... seems ok... for the experienced it's still a simcade.

The content, no commets it's a Open Beta, sorry!!! Early Access, my apologies.

I expect huge and major changes before putting a hand on it, I'll play it again when it really becomes a finished product (6 months or so... in my early... calculations).

1)	Menus turn unusable when a track/car is loaded. Very difficult to mess with car setup, controls, options etc in this situation, extremely lagged (Windows 10 64 bits)
2)	Stuttering mainly with many trees are loaded as where at Hunaudières straight before Mulsanne. The effect is boosted when many cars are loaded (RAM issue? 32 Gb here).
3)	AI is too much aggressive in first lap even lowering their aggressiveness in options menu (e.g. 25%), causing many collisions at multiclass racing starts and, in other hand, they become hesitant to overtake slower classes when race is stabilized.
4)	The rear end of all cars is way too loose, and it’s even more in fastest HY cars. Very unstable behaviour running on the kerbs and much oversteer when lift the gas pedal and/or in slow corners exit. I’ve never driven a Le Mans hyper car but if all cars were like this, 0 cars would finish the 24 hours. Maybe is a default setup issue, but it’s almost impossible to setup a car with the very slow menu in my side.

Secondarily, those aspects would be good if improved:

1)	The anti-aliasing is not good and if you’re set to max, FPS goes way (RTX3080)
2)	Some graphics and models are not very well done as the pit guy dummy.
3)	Tripple screen only configurable through dx11_config.ini right now.
4)	Strange steering behaviour in some hypercars, steering is too sensitive and not configurable even using custom rotation angles. GTEs and LMP2 are good in contrast of. 
5)	When starts to rain there’s a delay until AI drops their speed. They keep racing as be dry when you’re clearly struggling 1 – 2 seconds per lap due the wet surface. When eventually they start to suffer, the human player was overtaken and is way behind.

Aside that, it’s the rF2 physics, so it blows most of “simulators” on market. I can see the positives:

1)	Very, very well modelled cars and tracks. 
2)	Menus are a bit better and cooler than regular rF2.
3)	Light effects seem to be better than regular rF2 mainly during night.
4)     Arguably best sound in a racing simulator so far.",1708477885,1708478123,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,True

Virtual Mirror (Also needed badly for multiplayer)

after setting everything up it runs really nice, had to go into settings and change something to get the stutters away(they are very noticable but after completely gone) the menus also seem to be inpacted by the overall graphic settings, wich is weird. but running on high/medium mix made the menus responsive and the game still looking really good. looking forward to VR support but it is not something i miss would just be a nice gimic to have aswell.
the AI need some work the are very aggressive even on 5% aggression they do feel very human to race around with mistakes and occasional crashes, suprisingly my first online race was the same experience as offline where half the field was wiped out at turn 1, online has some bugs related to joining and it not loading or freezing a quick restart fixes this most times.
the physics feel really nice altough some cars feel very oversteery but that is fixable in setup, not the easiest when online races have fixed setup in the beginner playlist, but you can drive around it.

righty now for me the game in a full lobby runs around 200 fps on a 5600x and a 3060Ti so i can definitly put everything to high but menus are not a fan of that yet, still it looks very good

I had to run it on a large virtual screen in my headset (Steam theatre mode) to see just how much the textures and things have improved, and it's a significant jump. Can't wait for VR (which already sort of works), so we can see the quality of the modelling/textures/lighting in all its glory.

The bugs which currently seem to drive the negative reviews will be ironed out quickly, I'm sure, as they are mainly UI issues. It runs well for me in menus and in game on High settings, with 72FPS locked at 5120×1440 on my 3800/5800X3D setup. So the issues certainly don't affect everyone.

There is no better FFB and physics on the market in my opinion, but it is at least on a par with AC and iR if those are your preferences.

I've been in the Race Control system on rF2 for a few months and it works really well, so I don't doubt it will be the same in LMU. Safe drivers get rewarded with access to more advanced races/setups and you get put on grids with people of a similar skill level.

- MGU Launch in Hypercars, I mean come on that will always be a Pro.
- Sounds are excellent. They really bring to life the cars in a way that not many other sims can touch.
- Cold Tires, I have NEVER felt cold tires like it in a sim.

Cons;
- Performance is terrible. I have a system above reccomended specs and still stuggled, sometimes even unplayable frame rates.
- Menu's do not work at all, they just hang. 
- Graphics setup was not saving on my triples so needed configuring everytime I loaded up the game
- Loading times are long
- AI bugs out sometimes so you load into a session and there is none
- Should be an option to use a fixed steering wheel with no visible hands
- Head wobble cannot be turned and is motion sick inducing

-7 entirely laser scanned tracks day 1

If you like rF2, you'll like this! 

Driving physics are great (it's definitely rF2 underneath), tracks are amazingly detailed, I've tried a few cars over a few practice sessions, Toyota LMH and Ferrari GTE are the 2 best for me so far. 

As for the tracks - just try Sebring out! Driving it in a GTE car around it with a huge grin on my face!

Audio is spot on, some great details from the sound engine, and definitely a step up from rF2.

I've encountered lots of bugs, mainly UI based where the race length isn't actually what I set it as as a few others in the UI. The Ferrari LMH feels a bit strange (known issue) and I failed to join a practice session online then couldn't do anything in the menus, I had to restart the game. But it is early access so I can forgive it for a first release. I imagine it's the kind of stuff that'll be fixed quickly.

No performance issues for me (mostly medium settings on a R7 5800X3D, 32GB RAM, 2080Ti) game ran perfectly smoothly over the past 3 hours, I feel I can crank some settings for sure and still maintain steady FPS.

There's a huge list of known issues on their forum, they're working on it. As a base for early access this is a very good start. I've played much worse full releases in the past year.

I wasn't going to review at this stage, but seeing a lot of negative reviews who clearly don't understand what early access is, or those who just don't like MSG... (anyone else noticed MSG isn't even mentioned anywhere on this page? Or in recent press releases?) Some are rightly negative because of crashes and other major issues though hopefully those people can experience this soon!

UI is simple and clear.

Physics and FFB are excellent as expected. The new tires are awesome, feeling of grip very detailed. It seems to me that the curbs have become less slippery.

I liked the sound of the car and the effects.

The new special effects are also amazing, smoke from the wheels, dust from the off-track, it seems to me new sparks, glowing headlights, reflections on the car, haze in the distance, image in mirrors. Everything looks great.

The car models are also great. And the new tracks Fuji and Portimao are simply mind-blowing!

Performance has also increased significantly from rf2!

However, to my surprise, it's basically Assetto Corsa Competizione but with WEC cars. Sure, there's no career mode, but it launched TODAY (as of me writing this) in early access, it could be added later on (and I really hope it will be).

As for the online, I can't say anything since I've spent my 100 minutes getting used to the physics engine using the #24 Ferrari GTE car at Bahrain.

As for the Physics, they're really solid. I am mostly used to Gran Turismo, so to play something more sim-like is very nice.

There are, however, a few cons
- The side mirrors basically don't allow you to see anything. By the time you can see a car in them, either one of 2 scenarios will play out: either you'll have already collided, or they've already passed you
- The lack of an ACC-style radar. Especially when driving slower classes, it can be a little tough to see when a car is next to you. Of course, camera controls exist, but when you're racing wheel-to-wheel it's a little tough to focus on using the camera controls as well as driving
- The default graphics the game launches with aren't that great, most notably a lack of anti-aliasing. This was played on an RTX 3060 Ti with 8GB of VRAM. Of course, this can be fixed by tweaking the settings, but I wanted to hop into the driving first since I didn't know if I wanted to end up refunding the game or not. This point might be voided later on
- I've said this before, but the lack of a (proper) career mode. I think it would be insanely cool if you could start a team with team members you've hired yourself, or when driving alongside other drivers

Is it worth your money? If it were more than €30, I'd say a definite NO. In it's current state, however? it's not 100% worth it at the moment, but if you just want to recreate something like the Spa 6h or the Le Mans 24h without installing mods on the original Assetto Corsa, it's really worth it. And even then, this game gives you slightly more depth-filled controls than AC. I, of course, still see that this game has a long way to go, and I'm going to be with it every step of the way

The driving model in this game is incredible. GTEs especially are among the best cars I've had the pleasure of driving in any simulator to date.

I believe the devs are actively sorting out issues the players are reporting for further updates, so a little lack of polish here and there is excusable.

I had one option which was to race alone, no AI, nothing.

You can only race in online functions which are so overcrowded anywhere from 30 -60 available slots total. TOTAL for everyone jumping on and wanting to do a little race across the entire internet. i luckily managed to register and then the game wouldn't let me join, so pointless registering as it does nothing and does not hold a slot for you as the space which was available disappeared.

Some of you might think, that's okay i don't mind just setting some lap-times, well that is also flawed. when playing i get huge lag spikes, so bad that at a braking points it makes the game unplayable.

So in the current state, this game is unplayable and a complete waste of money, I shall refund and wait for all bugs to be fixed and might pick it up at a later point when all the problems are ironed out, but currently. this is closer to a poor demo with plenty of problems than early access.

There isnt alot of cars and tracks but thats to be expected for an early access title

The hick ups are as advertised but when you get it working you race yourself into one of the most promessing sim racing games of this decade.
Hypercar is the most technoligical advanced racing series of the moment, LMP 2 is fun and fast and GTE is the best point to get to know the advanced sports car series that is WEC.
With more cars incoming (new evolutions of hypercar and new manufacturers), the new GT3 cars and a level of detail that wil only evolve it's a must have for anny sim racing enthousiast.
Are there better sims? Probably but variation is always needed and everybody has a different flavour for racing so have a taste of everything and find what you like.
The cars feel fantastic on a Thrustmaster t818 with fanatec clubsport v3 pedals. It will only get better with driver updates and further support since there are so manny options for DD Bases or belt driven variants.
Since we are far past the point of universal software to run those bases some technical issues are expected for the launch of anny race game. Again, patience.

The FFB is great, a little slow - it's MSG so it was obviously gonna feel like rFactor
The sound design is incredible (except for the tire screech)
The visuals are very good (read below)

The Bad:
The cars feel like they're on ice almost constantly, regardless of tire warmth
Banished to the understeer zone on entry
Banished to the oversteer zone on exit
Banished to the both zone mid-corner
Aero exists until it doesn't
Trail braking does nothing until the apex
You can't push without being punished
Lockups flattening the tire and making the wheel shake is cool until you're violently vibrating

The Ugly:
HOLY SHIT THE PERFORMANCE IS SO BAD - Loading times like GTA Online, Menus are so so so laggy- what did they even test this on?? Don't even think about running high graphics, if you have to go to the settings menu in a race you lose minimum 10 minutes of your life. I'm on a 4070 and having major issues with the menus in a race, I can't imagine how painful this is for others.
THE AI SUCKS DONKEY DICK - People were saying the AI was bad and I just thought the AI didn't drive well, but no. The AI just crashes. constantly. Maybe mono-class it's decent, but multiclass is horrendous.

Some players are reporting crash issue, but I've faced none. Others are complaining about slow UI, what indeed I also faced, but just in the first minutes of gameplay. After that the UI started to work properly.

Talking about positive aspects, there is not to much to say once this game has all RFactor 2 qualities. I just would like to point out how great is the Force Feedback in this game. For me, RFactor 2 Force Feedback is the best in the market, and it is in Le Mans Ultimate.

-Amazing Graphics at certain times of day with good weather ( other weather types look pretty bad rn ngl ) 
-Car details and interiors are amazing
-Tracks are very Detailed and Accurate ( Love the new SPA update finally a game with a accurate version ) 
-Race weekend can be fun when it works

-A good amount of Game breaking bugs ( like crashes to desktop  ) 
-Cloudy and Raining weather looks pretty bad 
-Car taillight emissives ( lights ) are way too over brightened and saturated

Despite owning a high-end PC that runs every other game flawlessly, this title struggles to perform smoothly. From UI bugs in ultrawide resolutions to persistent issues with the escape menu, the experience is simply ridiculous. I won't even delve into the handling of the cars, as it's subpar compared to what even a platform like Roblox offers.

The GTE cars are particularly troublesome, lacking responsiveness in steering, while the Oreca stands out as the only decent option, ironically because it's a ported car from another game. Furthermore, the LMH cars suffer from inconsistent force feedback across models, with some feeling numb and lacking detail.

I haven't yet clocked many hours into the game, so these are my first impressions of it.

The basis -of course- is formed by the rFactor 2 engine. Some may like that, others don't. In this case, this truly feels like an evolution, an rF3 in my opinion. So even if you didn't like rF2, I would give this a try. It certainly is an improvement. The graphics look way nicer, the handling is great and improved, you really need to warm the tires with mistakes being punished and the sounds have definitely improved. FFB also feels better than rF2 (This is coming from someone who's put a lot of hours into that sim and really enjoyed it). You actually feel connected, a massive plus from before! The game in that regard feels finished. Also, the UI has received a nice new bit of paint and looks stunning. Hats of to S397. There are only a few things which do show the basis is formed by rF2 and it's engine: the marshal who points you the way you should go as well as the engineer who sounds still like a robot shouting your times.  

Content wise, you can't complain. For an Early Access title, the content is actually complete. (I'm referring to the cars here) This also is the case for the tracks. You can see S397 put a lot of time into developing LMU. It's not just a cheap port of rF2. For example, they could have easily ported the old Spa track from rF2, put some modern signs around it and call it a day. Yet, they didn't do this. This is the most modern version of Spa, with the new gravel traps, the new grandstands and the changed Eau Rouge-Radillion section. Theremay be a few things missing feature wise, but this is the most complete EA sim I got to enjoy. To make a comparison, I can still remember how few ACC gave you during EA for the same price! That sim was actually barren. This is not. Yes, not everything is present yet, but the basis is there and it's complete. 

In terms of problems, I can say I experienced only one. The menu is slow while in game, so changing a control input or a setup takes a while and a lot of patience. That is however the only problem I have faced (yet). No crashes, no bugs. 

Before I end this review (for now), I want to address the haters of the sim and generally those giving a negative review. As all of you can see, the negative reviews are mostly shallow and short. Yes there are a few things missing and some problems, but calling this unfinished goes a bridge too far. This is EA, and like I said before, the game actually feels very finished for an EA game. Tastes can differ, but the hate this is receiving is unjustified to say the least. 

I at least can't wait for this game to get more and more updates, and of course more content like GT3s and new LMDh cars of the 2024 season. Thank you S397 for giving us this EA.

I personally haven't had any serious performance issues running the game on the ultra preset, but my FPS was low on Le Mans. (kinda ironic its the worst performing track but its also the biggest)

Pros:
*In my experience, an Xbox Elite 2 controller DOES work

Decent pit mechanics
Loads of settings to create your ideal race weekend
Plenty of cars to choose from in each class

Lots of assist so most people could enjoy the experience even though its a sim
Great sound design

I think the best way to summarise it is saying this is rF2.5, as there are a lot of similarities both physics wise but also in the UI etc, but i'd say thats a good thing.

To start, I have had zero crashes or bugs, and performance has been great (easily reaching 144fps at 2K with everything set to high. I have a 3080 RTX, 32GB RAM, i9 CPU)
These seem to be the largest complaints from other users, and tbh, I have no idea what they are talking about. The user experience has been very smooth.

And also navigating the UI, (which was the bane of my existence in rF2) feels somewhat less clunky and the binding of controls is far more intuitive and easy than it used to be.

Anyway, onto probably the most important topic, Physics.
Overall i'd say they are very good, almost identical to rF2 (you're probably noticing a theme here) with some slight improvements here and there. 
And for the first time ever in sim we get the virtual fuel tank correctly implemented, so bonus points for that!
When it comes to FFB (on a fanatec DD1) I was able to use my default profile for rF2 with no tweaks and it felt great out of the box.
Basically, if you like rF2, you will like this.

When it comes to damage modelling it is fairly generic, much the same as rF2 or the style we get in ACC. Its nothing groundbreaking, but good enough.

I would also like to touch upon the AI for a bit, id say that generally they are ok, but just ok.
There isnt anything particularly special, they just do the job. Better than the likes of ACC at least.
They have good racecraft, and are predictable.
They are good to race against in mixed conditions.
Fairly good at navigating the other classes. (I dont think the AI on any sim can do this better though, its always been a weak point for sim racing)
My biggest and only real complaint here is that their speed between circuits isnt very consistant (at 100% i was about a second off the pace at Sebring, but then at 100% AI at Fuji it was me who was about a second faster... not ideal but easy to workaround for the user, and should be an easy fix for S397)

I think that's everything I wanted to say. I may come back to this review to edit it once ive played the sim some more.
But overall i'm very pleased and its definitely worth the £25 (a bloody bargain)
It is definitely up there amongst all the other flagship sim racing titles already, despite being labelled as early access, and I can foresee myself putting a lot more hours into this sim in the future.",1708446431,1708446712,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The physics engine is fantastic as expected from creator of rFactor 2. The sound of the car is exquisite which really adds to the immersion. The UI is well designed, easy to navigate and quite good looking. 

But this is definitely an unfinished game  as of now. Loading screen takes forever. Changing settings mid session is pretty much impossible due to how much lag there is. I barely got 60 FPS on medium setting with an RTX 3060. Overall, it’s just an un-optimized mess at the moment.

2. Only 'Race Weekend' is available - which consists of selecting one track. Career mode or some sort of championship mode does not exist. You're unable to customise driver names, talent profiles, and you cannot even specify individually how many cars are on track

However my first impression is absolutely positive.
Physics and ffb feels very detailled and a step forward from rF2. The tire model is very fine grained and seems believable in their certain conditions. This is top notch. You need have some skills to master driving such modern LMHs, LMP2 and GT3s. But it's very rewarding.
Graphics are realistic and offers nice lighting and a good amtosphere. The sound is outstanding. The Ui and HUD are clear, modern interpreted and very easy to use. The design fits pretty good to the WEC/content.
So far, the ai is also on a decent level and very fun to race and competitive.

Of course there are also some (from my point of view) minor bumps which is absolutely clear for the current status of the game like longer loading times.

At the bottom line for a title released at the stage of an EA/Beta...this is on a very high level. I know very well how other sims like ACC or AMS2 (just to have an example and nothing against both...I like them very much too, since I play all sims), but at this stage LMU is on a very very decent and promising level.

MP still not touched so far. I will do this in the short-term.

I am personally happy and looking forward for the game evolution.

Had personally no crash or perf issues but i do have a very very strong setting (3080Ti, 32G RAM DDR6, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, playing in 4K - Ultra settings).",1708443458,1708443554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1.you need to stop looking this game as AAA racing game title this game wasn't made by huge studios like T10, and plus its early access like all other game games early access is used to take feedback and work on it and fund the continued development
2. gameplay wise i had more fun than any other racing game like FM7,FM,F1, though not even remotely polished it definitely has its upsides,
3. more optimization is needed nonetheless i kinda expected this i play on medium on 5900x and 3070ti
4. ai is acutally decent and is far better than all forza series and car feels amazing

To start out with, it looks like there is a lot of problems with Nvidia cards, most of the performance issues i see from them
On AMD, i'm running this game on max settings with 140+ fps (7900 XTX, R7 5800X3D)
There is some problems with the UI at times in game, and menu sometimes gets really slow for unknown reason.

Its not the worst problems, and i dont think its going to be hard to fix.
But here comes why i think this game is worth getting.

First off, the content itself, everything feels amazing, some of the best simracing cars on the market, and the tracks are really nice too!
This is what i would say an improved rF2, with better physics and FFB, you could also make a bit of fun with their being some rF2 bugs :P 

The tracks also just feels really good, and the ambiance of the tracks are nice too, they feel very alive in a sense. 
(Bahrains night lights are also just shef kiss) 

But the main reason, i think is the multiplayer, launches with a system like iRacing, with ranked races, from fixed series like LMP2 or GTE, to full on multiclass races, and it feels very good too, but the formation lap is a bit confusing.

Overall a decent launch, but i hope they come out with some patches quick to fix the UI and performance issues.",1708443016,1708443016,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

Negatives:

1 - Multiplayer is only available for daily, weekly, and special events and you cant make custom lobbies with friends and other games like Assetto Corsa, F1-23, and other racing games allow custom lobbies
2 - Offline is great, but would love to see some sort of campaign because right now it is very bare-bones.
3 - Optimization is pretty bad, noticed the game was taking up much of my ram and the graphics look pretty bad unless you set it to ultra (you can't).
4 - The AI is kind of sucks, it will sometimes just randomly turn in on you and is very unpleasant.
5 - The loading screen to get into an offline race let alone an online one is atrociously long.
6 - found a minor bug in offline mode, not sure if its and online thing but the game will stutter mid lap and if you were up time on your delta it would get rid of it which angered me a little bit.

Positives:
1 - Handling feels amazing
2 - Sound is amazing
3 - Car and track design are incredible, felt very real

Some slight performance hiccups here and there and very very long loading times aside my first hour with the game was stable. No problems connecting online, races were about as solid as RFactor2. Which is understandable given it uses the same RaceControl architecture, ranked racing works in more or less the same way as it did there.

The AI definitely needs more work currently, if you are primarily an AI racer then I'd recommend checking out some gameplay before making your purchase. T1 and T2 into Monza was a total pileup, but you could argue that's just simulating the online experience perfectly.

In terms of driving feel it's very RFactor 2.5, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you enjoy RFactor 2's physics. It's a marked improvement over it, but a lot of the characteristics are still there,

All in all, a very solid foundation to build upon from here, it can only get better from here on out. I'm excited to see what Studio 397 have in store as Early Access progresses and the game is updated.",1708435995,1708435995,True,2,1,0.509316742420196533,0,True,False,True

However from what u experienced was a solid entry into the sim racing genre. The car controls are awesome. Braking is really good. Lockups are actually a thing. The FFB settings are good. Though it felt alittle weak but im sure I can adjust it more to my liking.
