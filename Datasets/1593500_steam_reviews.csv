Gameplaywise, its a walking simulator with one type of puzzle repeated over and over again throughout the whole game. Its really repetitive. The sections when you just walk arent that exciting because of how slow the main character is, the map is usually ultra-linear, but there are specific parts of the game with a lot of passageways and if you get lost, it becomes really stressful how slow the mobility is.""

Thats an extract of my Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice review. On the other hand, if we're talking about video games set in norse mythology in which you have a head hanging from your waist, God of War (2018) is the better game. God of War (2018) in fact is an amazing game. Really good and smooth gameplay, amazing writing, charming characters and villains, really good lore. This game in my opinion is the whole package. It can offer you super good boss fights that need real skill to overcome, and it can also give you incredible cutscenes with a mind-blowing emotional weight that can make you cry. Much more so if you played the original trilogy, as I did. I love the evolution of Kratos as a character and I love this father-son story set in a world as interesting as midgard. I'm very happy to be able to enjoy this game on steam, I'm very excited for the inevitable release of God of War Ragnarok on pc. Hope its soon. It's not a perfect game, nor is it a perfect port. But as a whole, it's totally worth it. Really recommend this one!

First of all, I didn't play any God of War games past the PS2 a decent few years ago. I watched a recap of GOW1-3's story before playing just to get my brain right towards the game's setting.. but surprised to see that from Greek Mythology we went into Norse Mythology! Which is also probably the most interesting mythology in my opinion.

So firstly the game is challenging. I am playing through the ""Give me challenge"" difficulty which is almost the hardest difficulty to pick up. The gameplay is VERY fun and in the past 2 weeks I probably was quite addicted to this game. 
On the other hand, I was blown from the fact GOW (well, at least this one, I can't really recall for the older titles) is very story rich. And the story is realllly good and interesting. I am literally wanting to see more every second of it and it keeps me on my toes. It's a lot more interesting if you have interest in the Norse Mythology as well! 

The attention to detail in this game is also solid. The level design is fucking mind blowing. There are those small things that you encounter in this game and it's just things you know you will only encounter in a god of war game. One of the MSQ level design got me really impressed. To keep it as spoiler-free as possible (skip this next 2 sentences if you want to ignore a minor level design spoiler) 

----------SLIGHT LEVEL DESIGN STORY SPOILER ------- a whole level is based on top and around a giant's dead frozen body. A real fucking giant. And it's HUGE. This giant also has facial hair (you literally walk past it's head) and it's fucking blowing in the wind. not to mention this giant also has NOSE HAIR. AND IT'S BLOWING IN THE WIND AS WELL. The attention to detail is just.. incredible in the level design.
------------ SPOILER END ---------

The graphics are reallly good. The atmosphere and the visuals are stunning. The gameplay is fun, challenging and addicting. And the performance is great, I always have high frames and no stutters/drops. Although, sadly the game did crash twice for me in 21h of playtime, but twice in 21h is acceptable. At least it wasn't during an intense boss battle or a cutscene!

Overall, I'd really recommend trying this game. The hack n' slash combat is solid, theres a good sense of progression and you can easily find challenge around the game. There are a lot of mysteries to resolve, side quests, collectibles and whatnot. I can't say for certain, but getting this game to 100% completion is for sure gonna take a while, I'm just around halfway through the game and I feel like I missed out a lot of side content that I'd have to go back and experience.

PLUS - the game is kind off open world? well, it is very open and you can basically go back to any point you visited during the game, and there is a some sort of fast travel you unlock sometime after the early game, AND there are 0 loading screens in-between. It's VERY open and the world is very big but I wouldn't call it a true open world game. Some areas are also locked behind mechanics which are unlocked later on the story.

Anyways - this is a great game. Highly addictive, fun and challenging. Definitely a 9/10 from me. for the most parts, I could not stop playing.
And for everyone who wonders why I gave it a 9/10 and not 10/10, it's because while the story is really good, rich and interesting (and long), the voice acting can be a little bit off sometimes, characters can repeat sentences in a robotic way at certain times, Kratos's running animation is a bit wonky and the movement animations could use a bit of a polish.
I am 100% certain this is intended, but whoever voiced Kratos is just.. I can't even explain it. You gotta play to understand. Great game.

The relationship between Kratos and Atreus is well done, the whole thing with Baldur and his mom felt like an afterthought. Most of the side characters were pretty interesting though. Some parts of the game, like when going into Jörmungandr's stomach, felt like a way to make the game longer without really adding anything.

Enemy variety is lacking. There is like 10 enemy archetypes and then those can be either fiery or icy. This is not enough for a game of this length. Boss fights are scarce and disappointing, although they have cool set pieces and epic moments.
 
Nifelheim, Muspelheim and the Valkyries are a giant pain in the ass. You have to put in a lot of effort for mostly copy and paste loot with a few unique armor pieces here and there. Honestly these extra locations actually detract from the main game.

The exploration and puzzles were simple but effective. The puzzles were very formulaic and this became very tedious after a while. The platforming and traversal are extremely basic and uninteresting.

The combat is simple, satisfying. Nothing too special. The ""Glory Kills"" that you can perform when enemies are stunned have little variety, they only seem to change depending on the enemy being either a standard unit or a fire bender etc., which is strange. Bigger enemies suffer from the same issue. Didn't care much for the armour and crafting system.

You can see why this game was big when it came out. It appeals to a wide audience and has enough depth for casual gamers to enjoy.

Minor Issues: Manual saves don't work. Camera is placed in a way that maximizes cinematography but hinders gameplay. After the end of the game Atreus will not shut up and repeats the same line over and over.",1673127305,1708895729,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From start to finish the game tries to tell you this emotional story of a father, son and mother, yet if falls flat. The biggest issues I have with God of War is the poor writing and the lack of player motivation.

First off, the writing: The narrative likes to drop new conflicts and whatnot into the story and tosses it out as quickly as it was introduced. One example was in the very beginning: While exploring, your son Artreus asks how it is to kill a person and Kratos, your character, explains that killing is part of surviving. “Close your heart” Kratos says. Fast forward five minutes and in a battle, Artreus kills a person. He is visibly shocked and feeling down. Not even a minute passes and this entire shtick is tossed out the window, never to be brought back again. There are plenty of these moments, where some sort of obstacle is presented for both Kratos and Artreus only for it to be discarded minutes later. And with this the pacing also feels very off. Everything moves too fast. Conflicts aren’t real. They are only here to give you the illusion of conflict. They might as well remove them and it would still play out the same.

Now the motivation part is a bit difficult to explain but I try my best: The groups entire motivation for this game’s story is to scatter the ashes of Kratos’ deceased wife on the peak of the highest mountain. It is after all her last wish. Who is this wife? I don’t know. And the game doesn’t tell me either. I understand that Kratos, her husband, and Artreus, her son, want to honor her wish. But me? The player? This isn’t a movie where I watch the characters do what they do. I am in direct control. Both the characters and me should share the same motivation. But I couldn’t care less about this woman. I never even get to see her, so why should I care.

The gameplay is a mixed bag. Combat is serviceable at best. First off, the camera is way to close to your character. It feels more like a third person shooter. Spatial awareness is thus gone. But I feel the developers knew this and added an indicator at the bottom, warning you if an enemy is behind you or if it is attacking. With this the combat becomes laughably easy. Beat an enemy until one of those indicators turn red, turn around by 180° and block. Rinse and repeat. It feels claustrophobic and all threat is gone. The game is a button masher with no real strategy or depth. The charged axe attack, you can unlock pretty much from the beginning, allows you to deal massive damage to a single normal sized target and cause it to stay limp on the floor for a short time. But enough time for you to run towards him and do the same charged attack again. The game also has RPG elements, such as enemy levels and gear levels. They could’ve just skipped those. Not every game needs to play like an action-RPG.

Graphics and sound are good. No complains here. Music isn’t anything special, but that’s just me.",1702497369,1708816283,False,2,0,0.348916471004486084,0,True,False,False

Santa Monica Studio has not only revived Kratos but has also reinvented the entire God of War franchise, giving players a deeply emotional and compelling journey that stands out as one of the finest in gaming history.

The narrative takes center stage, weaving a poignant tale of fatherhood, redemption, and the consequences of one's past actions. Kratos, once a rage-fueled Spartan seeking vengeance, now finds himself in the world of Norse mythology, accompanied by his son Atreus. The dynamic between father and son forms the heart of the story, creating a bond that is as vulnerable as it is powerful.

Graphically, God of War is a visual spectacle. The attention to detail in the character models, environments, and cinematic sequences is breathtaking. From the mythical landscapes of Midgard to the intimidating creatures that inhabit it, every aspect of the game is a testament to the capabilities of modern gaming technology.

The combat system is a perfect blend of visceral action and strategic depth. Kratos' Leviathan Axe is not only a devastating weapon but also a versatile tool that can be thrown and recalled with precision. The integration of Atreus into combat adds an extra layer of strategy, as players can command him to shoot arrows, providing crowd control and setting up combos.

Exploration is encouraged, and the world of God of War is rich with lore, hidden secrets, and challenging puzzles. The game seamlessly combines a linear narrative with open-world elements, offering a balance that keeps players engaged without feeling overwhelmed.

The soundtrack, composed by Bear McCreary, complements the game's emotional beats perfectly. From haunting melodies to powerful orchestral compositions, the music enhances every moment, drawing players deeper into the world of God of War.

One of the most commendable aspects of the game is its single-shot camera style, a technical marvel that adds a cinematic quality to the entire experience. The continuous shot creates a sense of immersion, eliminating loading screens and maintaining a seamless flow from one scene to the next.

God of War (2022) is a triumph on all fronts, a game that pushes the boundaries of storytelling, gameplay mechanics, and technical achievement. It stands as a shining example of what the video game medium is capable of when approached with passion, creativity, and a commitment to excellence. Santa Monica Studio has not only redefined the God of War series but has set a new standard for the industry as a whole. This is not just a game; it's an epic journey that will resonate with players for years to come.",1696316196,1708713608,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Very rarely do I run into games where after I play, I not only crave for more of the experience, but I feel completely satisfied that my time was worth spending experiencing a game's world, lore, and characters. God of War (2018) is not just a video game, it is a cinematic experience that can seamlessly transition between video game and cinema.

The cinema aspect comes from the game's story about a father (Kratos) and his son (Atreus) and their journey to spread their mother's ashes on top of the highest peak in all the realms. It’s a story about parenting, and how Kratos and Atreus learn to become better people in wake of the mother’s passing. Kratos learns to become a better father for Atreus, and also for himself to be a bigger person than the murderous enraged wrecking ball he used to be in the previous games. Atreus learns to become a man through Kratos’s teachings and experience, slowly getting stronger and stronger as his learns from mistake after mistake. Kratos and Atreus’s personal journey is brilliantly contrasted by the game’s main antagonist, Baldur. For a great explanation on why Baldur is such a great villain in this game, I would recommend checking out this YouTube video by FatBrett. He makes great analysis videos on the characters within this game and its sequel, Ragnarok: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vSCABh1K8

Speaking of Kratos, this game is technically the 4th entry in the God of War series. Despite this, I went into this game without any knowledge of God of War, and I followed along with the story and characters easily. Halfway through the game, I realized that anyone could pick up this game and easily understand what was going on without any prior knowledge of Kratos or other characters. If that turned you off from picking up this game, I can assure you you’re only robbing yourself from an unforgettable experience by delaying your purchase of this game (No, this review isn’t sponsored).

The gameplay is akin to hack-and-slash RPGs such as the first two Kingdom Hearts games and Dark Souls, and gives the traditional hack-and-slash game genre a more cinematic flare with its dynamic camera angles and fluid controls. The game also has a great amount of optional exploration involved, where if you’re willing to sink even more hours into this game, you will be greatly rewarded with upgrades and weapons that’ll help you with late game enemies and bosses.

In my opinion, I would not classify this as a game. Rather, I’d classify God of War as an ‘experience’. It easily makes my Top 5 video games of all time, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in a single-player experience they’re willing to drown hours upon hours of time.",1708650235,1708650235,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The visuals are truly fantastic at some points and it really shows what the latest hardware is capable of when using DLSS and FSR, the soundtrack could have been better by adding Norse music or something similar its a bit disappointing compared to the rest of the game. An intriguing story that continues throughout the game and provides some interesting insights about the continuing story line of the 'God of war' series. Action packed with great atmosphere although a bit repetitive at times, in terms of games it is a masterpiece because it gets 9.5/10 for visuals and 9/10 for game play and 9/10 for story content and just lacks slightly 6/10 for sounds.  I would recommend to most people and maybe not kids, the violence and gore is not as bad when compared to other games. overall 'God of War' gets 9/10 and sits on the 'Hall of Fame'",1708645744,1708645744,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

God of War 2018 is a tedious disappointment that tricked critics & newcomers to the series into loving it by its stunning graphics & lies.

God of War has lost its identity, no longer is it seen as a high-octane game meant to combat the Japanese side of the ""Hack 'n' Slash"" market against games alike Devil May Cry, as in attempt to prove the Westerns can produce high-quality action-adventure games with deep game-play. Now God of War is produced to be a ""movie-like experience"", even the developers see & describe it as such. God of War has lost its spirit and what defined it. God of War is gone.
And while studious alike Capcom still strive with their wonderful continuations of Devil May Cry, without losing sight of what essentially defined the series. God of War on the other hand has completely failed at what it set-out to do.



[h1] Combat & systems [/h1]

The game no longer is based upon a smart resource management system. The entire magic-meter is gone. Now it's been replaced with a cooldown system, meaning it's all about just getting as many big attacks out ASAP so that you can use them quicker again. It's no longer playing offensively, no, you're now playing defensively. It's a horrible mesh of mushed mechanics. It's like the game's priorities is just honing in on looking nice & keeping you lulled into a sense of satisfaction by the false feeling of might; just so you can play all the way through it and think it was any good. It's been corporate manufactured to be able to coast through the entire game without thinking [b]ONCE[/b]. But when I'm not thinking, I'm not engaged.

The enemies in this game are OK at best. Though there's over 70+ different enemies!!!! [b]WOAAHHH[/b] tots rad dude. Or, well, actually just 3 and 67 re-skins. I counted myself, no need to fact-check it. You'll be fighting the exact same dudes from the beginning of the game 'till the very end, just in different colour variant. Combat quickly gets stale due to this, I've fought the ogre & gorilla bosses more times than I have teeth in my mouth.
""but hey this time the ogre is red and has more health!"" yet they're all just dudes. Brown dude, blue dude, human dude, green dude, red dude, purple dude, stone dude, magic dude.... [b]JUST DO SOMETHING ORIGINAL![/b]
Remember all the wacky enemies from the hexology and how diverse the cast is? God of War 2018 [b]REALLY[/b] needed a larger & more diverse cast of enemies; add some cryptid enemies from Northern mythology or [b]SOMETHING![/b]



[h1] A husk, a shell, a f#cking ghost of its former self [/h1]

How is this an ""upgrade"" by any standards? Platforming has been reduced to pressing 'Space' over small holes & climbing flypaper walls.
There is no fail-state in platforming anymore. You can't jump into pits, as there's no jump-button. You can't fall from walls due to it all being scripted & there's no longer any climbing combat sequences. If I can't lose then why isn't this just a cut-scene?
I loved the classic hexology's platforming. Smart, clever, snappy, and fast. Now it's just copy-pasted Uncharted platforming... but dumber... somehow.

The camera in this game is godawful. They removed the fixed camera beloved from the classic, and instead replaced it with the same one from The Last of Us. This change just doesn't work whatsoever.
In a combat-focused game where you can get surrounded by multiple enemies you [b]NEED[/b] a camera to see 360 view of your character. Santa Monica, instead of making a good camera, instead just added some dumb radar at the bottom of the screen to show where the enemies are, thinking that'll fix the entire problem. Spoiler alert: it doesn't.
It plays like a shooter, with its over-the-shoulder camera & projectile-like attacks. It's why it plays so much better on KB/M than controller.

Puzzles has been reduced to puzzles you'd see in a dentist's waiting room. ""Hit that object with your axe"" is every single puzzle in this game. There's no variety.
I remember the awesome puzzles of God of War 3, where you'd get sh!t like [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baupn8cT7ZY&ab_channel=WikiGameGuides] this [/url] or [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eV8rQxlAvo&ab_channel=Soltronkv] this [/url]
The puzzles don't need to be hard, they just need to be fun & unique.
Actually, the closest thing you get to a puzzle in this game is deciphering whether a ""+5% burn damage resistance"" is wristband is better than the ""+0.5% run speed"" poop sock.

And the loss of in-air combat? Sad.
Forget about double-jumping; here you can't even single-jump.



[h1] Death of music [/h1]

This music is so goddarn boring I'm gonna die.
There's so little to talk about, it's so generic. Gone are the epic choirs & rancid orchestra of the classic games, now replaced by the most underwhelming & bland music ever forged by mankind.
I can't name a single track, any beat, or any singular sound of the soundtrack. It's so incredibly forgettable & lame. Most of the time I forget it's there, as it's just occasional generic drum beats.



[h1] Open-world [/h1]


I don't think I've ever played such an pale & bland open-world as God of War 2018's world, ever.
Also the game has no need to be an open-world. It's like Santa Monica saw Horizon Zero Dawn and said ""we gotta do that"", and thus tried so... and succeeded in making it equally bad.
the world is riddled with lame-ass chests & other boring collectibles.
""You found 1 golden piss boy statue out of 765""
Also when a game forces you to use fast-travel instead of walking in specific missions, as walking the world is too boring, then you know the world is f#cked-up & empty.



[h1] Story [/h1]

Kratos has now turned into a secondary Joel Miller 2.0; they're the same exact character. He'll walk into a room and say ""boy, this place smells like a goddarn Cheetoh factory, boy."" and that's all his dialogue.
Kratos has lost any & all personality which he gained through all the classic games.
And the people talking about the maturity of Kratos also compare Cuphead to Dark Souls.
Atreus is the most annoying video-game character ever. He's like Jar Jar Binks.
Every time he speaks I just wanna punch this kid. [b]shut the f#ck up.[/b]

I think the only characters I ever truly enjoyed throughout the entire story was Mimir & Baldur....... albeit only in the first hour of their introductions. Their characters fall-off so hard after you finally get to meet them. They both started off so interesting, but then you learn Mimir is just Atreus 2.0 & Baldur gets so uninteresting when the game tries to ""humanize"" him.
Any & all other characters in this story are just bland vessels. I do not care for them. Doesn't help they never shut the f#ck up either. If Kratos doesn't care for any of these NPC characters whatsoever, then why should I, the player, care for them? They're nothing but quest-givers & noisy gobble talkers.



[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

As a long-term die-hard God of War fan since 2011, I've lost all hope for God of War the entire God of War brand.
I'll never recommend this game to anybody, and instead only direct them to the classic original hexology.

For anybody that says this is the best game in the entire series, they, a million times out a million, will fall into one of these three categories:
1. They've never played any of the original games in the series.
2. They have played the original games, but it's been a very long time since then, and thus their memory is fuzzy.
3. They're a very big The Last of Us fan.

God of War 2018 is a misunderstood & over-hyped game made for people that hate playing God of War games
It felt like an insult to play this game.
And it's sad, as it is a [i]fine[/i] game on its own. However, it's a [b]HORRIBLE[/b] God of War game. The hexology will always reign supreme, but I'd love this game if it wasn't keeping itself up to the same standards as the previous 6 games. God of War proved it could strive & fly; so when the series dips: it flops.",1647353682,1708541219,False,16,5,0.510115087032318115,16,True,False,False

But. It all breaks then you're facing enemies that are supposed to be tough - half of them are pure mechanics and they are good. Another half - camera/lockon fucks you up because fuck you. Or if you are playing on first difficulty - that makes ALL other enemies except troublesome just meh (even swarming does not mean anything). And you still gets fucked up because camera have no HP - there are some issues with enemy design and camera placement which went under the hood because of ""overwhelmly positive"" (at they still persists in Ragnarok too) reviews.
However higher difficulties make enemies much spongier while drastically rises their dmg, dunno if there are better ways - powerlevel is somewhat broken to my opinion: same River mob but pw7 oneshots you at pw3 through parry - is it good? is it so bad? it's managable to no-damage setup (evade and/or ranged combat) but most of the death will still come because of camera/lockon. And come on ranged Kratos - that's a joke, but kinda meta- gameplay on higher difficulties.
The whole power routine is trapped for my opinion: the begining is easy until pw of the mobs begins to scale up. <new weapon> on locked story part is awesome and then immidiatelly become useless until heavy upgrading. :D Also 8h gate is still in place
Also, VRAM leaks (~5-6h session on 1080p at 3080, somewhat shorter for 4K, ridiculously short for Steam Deck according to discussions). Not and issue for me, but ""another but"".

Not because it is difficult, but because of the way the difficulty is created.  If you are a glutton for punishment and rely on luck to win then perhaps it is worth playing at this difficulty level however I regret trying this.  The opponents are the same but the seemingly have MUCH shorter cooldown times on special moves than a god, their health bars decrease less easily than those of a god and they seem to move faster than a god.  Their self-healing is MUCH better than Kratos', and him a god, even if in reduced circumstances.  The opening fight promised epic, the game fights - not so much. 

When I consider that in his first fight he barefist punches a rock pillar to smithereens in a fight with a god eventually beating the god but he has difficulty punching a dent into an enemies health bar of ?mortal? grunts in a mortal world during gameplay,  Kratos swings a tree trunk to bash an opponent into orbit but his axe strokes are stopped by mortal shields? No way.  The promise of godly powers and the reality of equipment reliance disappointed me.

You cannot change the difficulty level if you elected ""God of War"" so I 'm stuck.  Example:   I'm in the Northri Stronghold looking for a whetstone, I land on a beach and face an Ogre and a Viken/Hel-Viken.  The Ogre throws stones hat curve towards you if you dodge close to the outer paved circle around the fire brazier/bowl.  Why he does not punch the rock to smithereens as he had done before I don't know.  Another example is a fight you have as you enter Helheim and try to go past the locked gate.  You have to climb down a tall spire which has a treasure chest caught in frozen vines halfway down.  After climbing down you  enter a bowl-like arena.  An ""Ice-Viken?"" appears right next to an huge gap into an abyss, you can stun him fairly easily but then Kratos throws him into the middle of the arena where he recovers instead of the abyss right next to him.  Eventually you wait for a lucky break and Kratos does throw him into the abyss.  The rest of the enemies have many ranged attacks so the combination of Ice-Viken and them is painful to overcome without luck.  I also did not experience the ""reduced damage"" the tips mentioned that battered enemies would have.  That could be simply a mathematically small percentage of total damage that is actually reduced and is difficult to see in the heat of combat.  It is also frustrating that even weak enemies have ranged attacks that are devastating to Kratos' health whereas his ranged attacks are weak - even against weak enemies.  This reduces Kratos from ""God of War"" to a simple grunt with godly aspirations trying desperately to upgrade equipment from too ineffectual to barely adequate which, to me, is a great pity.

Other than the tedium of repeating fights until you luck out.  Levelling Kratos was fun and made sense if you ignore my previous point that he's a god, not a grunt.  I enjoyed the story and the graphics is GREAT.  The keyboard/mouse combinations were easy to learn and made sense during play and combat.  Character movements and actions are brilliantly done and you can almost forget you are not watching a movie.  The difficulty setting I was unhappy with for the reasons I stated but the combination of enemies at the level I chose was obviously perfectly chosen to give the player the most difficult combination of enemies possible, I can understand that.  One surprise was that the enemies were upgraded during the same fight from level 5 in one instance to level 7, now that was unexpected.

In all I love the game even with the issues stated.  It is an old game and my comments are aimed at giving occasional players like myself a heads-up on difficulty level choices.

This part comes months later:
I finished ""God of war"" difficulty, hating the fights.  I replayed at ""Give me a challenge"" and loved the fights, you can actually use all these special moves effectively, as well as strategise some other than ""run and dodge and die till you luck out"".  The last fight with Baldur was ""run and dodge again"" but overall - play the game at ""give me a challenge"" level - great fun.",1705271449,1708352220,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""I'm not playing a game; I'm having an experience."" That’s what it is like when playing this game, an experience. The graphics, the setting, the lore, the gameplay, the set-pieces, the voice acting, the emotions, the story. All fantastic.

As a father, I’ve experienced losing a child and the grief that comes with such a loss. At the beginning of the game, I felt every bit of Kratos’ loss. I felt and understood the difficulty to bond with your child during a time of grief; the overwhelming fear that comes over you when you see your kids go down the wrong path; the pride when witnessing their growth. I also felt every bit of Frea’s pain; the compulsive need to protect your child at all costs and the consequences of doing so. Thankfully, these feelings and emotions aren't ignored infavor of action. The story gives the characters plenty of time to fully experience, explore, and process these feelings until their ultimate conclussion.

While Kratos and Andreas process their grief, they navigate through beautifully realized worlds and battle interesting and unique monsters. The battles flowed well, and the combat controls were spot on. The fight with the dragon and the various fights with the Stranger are epic in execution and scale. By the end of the game, I felt like an absolute bad ass.

Lastly, I have never played any of the previous God of War games and I did not feel lost or that I needed to have played previous installments to understand what was happening in the story. The things I needed to know were shown to me and that is a huge plus.

This game is an absolute gem and I can't wait to play Ragnarok whenever it makes it to PC.",1706224728,1708316315,True,145,4,0.916780650615692139,4,True,False,False

Magnificent world aesthetics. 
Powerful combat scenes especially when fighting bosses.

However, a few things I disliked about the game being:

1. Some mechanics are not friendly for controller users

- Valkyries are probably one of the most fun battles in the game. 
Except for one who can dash to your blind spot and by the time you move your camera slowly with your controller to find her, you'll get attacked without knowing what hit you. 
Lock-on target won't follow, it just disappears. 
And the 180-turn button? I never really use it in battle or anywhere since it makes me nauseous.

- The chests locked by 3 runes, there was one I remember vividly in Alfheim that requires you to be very quick with those axe throws, meaning if you don't hit all 3 within the time limit, the runes will relight itself very quickly. That one got me to use my mouse and keyboard control to aim instead.

2. Two side realms are fun.. just for the first time?
I got excited to see what those worlds will be like, and yes, they look very different from other realms, and the quest mechanics are different.

- Muspelheim: you'll be required to spend at least 1-hour long of mashing buttons to kill hordes of monsters.

Yes, I joke you not. There's one challenge telling you to kill 100 monsters, each wave spawning around 3-8 monsters depending on which kind they are.
Each wave probably take you around 5-10 minutes, and I'm only playing on Normal difficulty.
Let's just say there are 10 waves and you clear each wave within 5 mins, meaning it'd take you 50 minutes just for this single challenge alone.

It was fun at first, but it gets boring/tiring quick. 
I just did 2 for each sword (There are 5 swords in total, so 10 challenges to get to the Valkyrie, however, the difficulties and the time they'll take vary.) and the Valkyrie at the end, then I went back to other realms instantly.

- Niflheim: this is again another mashing buttons simulator. 
You'll need to keep grinding a maze with time limit for each run. 
You need to find ""Mists"", a resource found only here, from treasure chests placed within the maze, and there are monsters and traps along the way. 

If you want to unlock every chest and realm tear, you might have to do 10+ runs, each run might take you about 10-20 mins on Normal difficulty. (Not including the time if you get lost during the grind, you'll need to be paying attention when you grind the maze.) 
The time it takes you will vary since every run and room will spawn different monsters.
There are revenants and lizards designed to just take as much time as possible, too.

There's also a side-quest here that requires you to seal all 3 realm tears, which you'll have to grind the hell out of the maze first to unlock.

As for me, I did about 5-10 runs..? 
I defeated the Valkyrie, crafted new armors and talisman, upgraded them as far as I could, opened 2 from 4 golden chests to upgrade my axe, only sealed 1 realm tear and I'm outta there. 
It's so tiresome if you were to grind everything here. Probably will take you 4 hours+ of grinding the maze.
My recommendation? Just grind enough to craft the armors and open the 5000 mists golden chest to upgrade the axe, then leave this place.

Not only that, a bonus for the diligent players!
Each time you open a treasure chest, a specific animation will play, right? 
That animation will play every time you open any chests in the maze. 
And how many chests are there? Well, each run will probably have around 10-20 chests.
I didn't care to count, since there were so many.
I don't know if there's an option to turn off these animations but well.. Too late now anyways.

I better go play the main story, bruh.

TLDR: Some side quests are better left untouched, or at least, just get to know it for a bit, grind for whatever you may want, and go do other things before your frustration consumes you.",1708086314,1708136843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cool game - definitely worth a try!
See my profile for more details about my reviews.

I am not a God of War fan per say - I discovered the first one back in the day, that's 20 years ago or something, on a PlayStation 2 lent by a friend. I found it very refreshing, these early 2000s were the time were many big western studios tried their own take on the Zelda genre (the amazing DarkSiders 1 being another one example). Ridiculously epic, puzzles interesting enough, level design quite personal with riveting scenery, fascinating lore + bosses + climbing of the divine pantheon... The second one was not bad either, I kind of drifted away around the 3 because I had no PlayStation anyway... then I forgot about the series God of War for years.
So anyway, how does this reboot of the series fare? Very good! I am very impressed. The first couple of hours, I was worried that it would look very, very similar to Tomb Raider (the same reboot, the same American style... not bad, just okay). But eventually it went a different path, even further: I believe the scenario of this reboot is MUCH better than Tomb Raider. The tone is much more on the psychology side than the old trilogy I knew. Giving a child to the hero could have been a mistake, or a burden... but it actually creates all the spice in the scenario, the dialogues, the depth of the psychology at every corner of the narration. The boy AND the comic relief of Mimir (third character) is an excellent balance. Beware though, the tone is very grown up, probably even more than before, and as a dad this game talked to me even more. The relationships with other characters (Baldur, Freya...) are quite raw and violent, reminiscent of heavy TV series where ugly psychologies hurt each other - but smartly written, be reassured. Just... not for kids!
The gameplay itself has been a bit toned down, less brainless action, a bit heavier, a bit simpler... is it better? not sure. It is like a mix of a soft FromSoftware and any 3rd person game like Assassin Creed, Horizon Dawn etc. It is very pleasant, not too easy, not too hard. Which means, overall, the balance in this reboot puts the accent on the content rather than the form, which for me is a plus I suppose!
It will take you dozens of hours to finish with everything, but the main story is already quite generous. Now I am eager to see where they went with Ragnarok and the future of this new series, God of War is still awesome!",1707889509,1707889509,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I decided to get the platinum, and it was grindy, but not nearly as bad as you see online.

Story is a masterpiece (9/10)
Gameplay was a little repetetive especially the combat, but also good (9/10)
Graphics are beautiful (10/10)

Overall 9.3/10

This is my first Game of War game so i don't know are the others but this game is not open world in a traditional way of speaking it's openish and for me that was a bummer. On top of that if you put the movement, the bugs/the glitches, the camera and maybe the controls it turns your experience in something not very pleasant. You'll find on the internet people liking all the systems and people that really don't. I'm somewhere in the middle so you decide.

Note: For the camera i used a program called ""flawless widescreen"" because the close shoulder camera gave me motion sickness for some reason. After putting 23% on that program everything was good and could enjoy my playthrough.

After 60 hours i finished everything having 100% completation but at the end i couldn't wait to just finish it. At the end i had a couple of things to do and being stuck on parts of the map because it's not a trully open world game and had to go back the same way just to find a raven or something was really annoying. Fast travel is accesable only from some points so you have to go there and going through mystic gateways is such a boring thing ... so boring that if it's not the other part of the map i would just walk. Oh and the map ... i get it ... it's immersive and cool but sometimes i would just rather have a normal map. A switch would have been great. 

In the end if you can live with the controls it's a really good game the rest are small things. It's an incredible story and the small interactions between characters are just priceless.",1707820233,1707820233,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bonus if you do learn some of the combos, they aren't necessary, but they can make fight sequences really fun if you get used to them. If you really enjoy single player story games - this one is pretty much a 10/10 for me- just solid and nearly everything felt well polished. 

Many of the bosses are a ton of fun to fight. The Valkyrie fights, while completely optional, are very challenging and rewarding. Especially the Valkyrie queen. I probably had to fight her 20 times - I highly recommend you completely this optional quest line. Speaking of that - so much content is optional, but if you do it then you really are a God once you get around to the main story. I never felt challenged in the main quest bosses - mostly because I was probably overpowerd by the time I got around to each one I spent alot of early game exploring the optional content which lets you upgrade your armor, skills, etc. 

The puzzles are fun too, good mix of solving puzzles - and then just having to bash in enemies. Great game. Really appreciated the father son dynamic as well - they did a good job adding depth and character growth in this game. Appreciate the hard work from the studio overall, thank yall.

I've always enjoyed the God of War games and found the story quite entertaining but this is a whole new level for me. I found the story so incredibly well written. The focus is on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus (his son). Watching them grow together, seeing Kratos  mature and learn how to be a dad was wonderful. This relationship is being constainly developed as Atreus always has something to say and has some comment about what's happening and what you're doing in the moment. Seeing Kratos slowly relive his past and come terms with it and try to teach Atreus to be better was truly unexpected. I love the new direction they took him. He's no longer just a blood lust, screaming Spartan looking for revenge.

On top of that, the gameplay is also super fun! The hack and slash mechanics always feel fresh as you get new skills, which result in different combos and new ways of attacking your enemies.

One important note, I played on the steamdeck and, while the game runs quite well, even in original settings, there is a (supposedly) memory leak bug that will result in a total crash after an hour or so of gameplay. It's a shame the game is verified in such a state but there is a quite simple way to solve it! You just need to install CryoUtilities and use it to increase the deck's swap file. The creator of this tool has a very good video explainig how this works.

God of War original trilogy are the first games that really got me into gaming. I did play games before that as a kid, but I wasn't really gaming that much before them. However, when I got my ps2 back in 2010 I discovered these amazing games. I've beaten GoW and GoW2 around 8,9 times each back then. Then I rented ps3 to play God of War 3 for the first time, and it was spectacular. Even today in my opinion GoW3 is the best game in the franchise and one of my all-time favorite games. As for this game, I've already beaten it twice on ps4 before and it was a pretty good game, but for me, it definitely doesn't have the charm that previous games have.

After the events of the first three games, Kratos now lives somewhere in the north where Norse Gods rule. He is not as angry as he used to be, it seems like he has matured a lot and found his peace in the north. He has a son called Atreus and a wife who just died, and her last wish was for you to spread her ashes at the peak of the highest mountain. And that's what's happening in this game, this incredible journey to the top of the mountain. It will probably sound stupid to you when you first read it like this, but don't sweat, there is way more to this. As in all God of War games, expect that you will meet some gods on your way, it's a pretty cool journey, with a touching, emotional story about the bond between a son and his dad. The characters and acting are awesome, and later in the game, you will find [spoiler] Mimir, the smartest man alive, who will follow you and tell you so much stories about the world, gods and so on [/spoiler]

Gameplay is amazing. First of all, your main weapon unlike in the previous game is a flying axe. You can throw it literally anywhere you want and call it back. You can upgrade your axe, attach special runes to it, which let you call some kind of magic attacks. What's also new are different armor sets that you can wear, and it wasn't possible to change your armor before. You can also attach some special items to your armor slots which will improve your stats, let you slow down time, and so on. So with your axe combined with all these runes and armors, you can do a lot of different combos, and they are awesome. You will also unlock some other weapon later, but I won't spoil you that. Atreus also helps you in combat a lot. While you are fighting your enemies, he will distract other enemies, and you can order him to shoot arrows and sometimes he will find health gems if you use the correct equipment. He is definitely a big help, and I pretty much spam his arrows all the time. You also have the ability to use rage, in which Kratos is pretty much invulnerable and you will fight using your fists and deal a lot of damage. The rage meter fills up as you are fighting. Camera angles are not as before, they are now zoomed way more and fights are slower in general. Difficulty-wise game is not really hard on normal, but on hard you will need to explore side stuff to be able to overcome your enemies. I didn't even try the hardest difficulty, so I can't say for sure. 

So how's the world and side stuff? Well, the idea was cool, but I think that the execution wasn't the best. As you progress through the main story you will be able to access a few of the nine realms in Norse mythology. Most of the time you will spend in Midgard (the realm of men). While exploring side stuff you will be able to loot a lot of items, track your completion progress, fight strong Valkyries, and do some side quests. I was personally never fun of looting items, finding new gears, and so on, so I didn't really enjoy fighting while exploring. Side quests were pretty boring, so I just did them for completion. Fighting Valkyries was fun, and it was the hardest challenge in the game. I really enjoyed collecting artifacts, finding Odin's ravens, and so on. Aside from Midgard, you will also visit a few more realms, but two of them are just dungeons and combat trials, while 3 are story-related. None of these realms were particularly interesting to me, but they were fine. 

Story bosses are mediocre. The first and last boss fights are excellent, but the rest of them are mostly fighting trolls, so I think that they aren't that good, except mentioned 2 and one more. Side bosses are a similar story except for Valkyries which are awesome. Took me 50 hours to 100% complete the game on hard, but I've already beaten the game before and I really took my time, so if you only want to focus on the main story with a bit of exploring t shouldn't take you more than 35 hours. If you specifically focus on the main story, you will probably be able to finish it in around 20-25 hours. Performance is okay I guess, it ran well, but not perfect. I had occasional stutters, but they didn't bother me. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Incredible gameplay
- Outstanding dialogue and acting
- Great story
- Amazing characters 
- Touching bond between dad and his son
- Random Norse tales 
- [spoiler] Sigrun, Valkyrie queen[/spoiler] is the perfect boss

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
- Story bosses are meh, but few are good, and Valkyries rock
- Pace was meh, a lot of filler content
- Performances are okay

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
 - World is mediocre. While having multiple realms was cool, it's mostly repetitive. Side realms are boring and uninspiring, wasted potential, which I hope will be improved in the next game
- I don't really think that this formula of ""open world"" really works with God of War, which was specifically a hack and slash game, in my opinion, it would be a much better game if developers focused on the main story like before while making difficulties more balanced, so we don't have to explore the side stuff to be able to beat harder difficulties, since it wasn't that interesting to me

[h1]Verdict:[/h1] God of War 2018 is really a great game, and I had a ton of fun with it while beating it three times. It's definitely one of the best God of War games out there and definitely my top 20 favorite games of all time, however,  I think that God of War 3 is the best without a doubt. I would recommend this game to anyone who played these games before, and to people who didn't, however for the best experience you should play the original trilogy, or at least GoW3 cause it still looks awesome, and that game is a hack and slash masterpiece.

The game's universal appeal ensures that it caters to a diverse audience, and as someone who has conquered every achievement on Steam during my second playthrough (initially on Playstation 4), I can confidently say that God of War is an immersive experience that leaves a lasting impact.

For those unfamiliar with the God of War series, worry not – the game effortlessly welcomes newcomers. Kratos, our protagonist and the God of War, occasionally shares snippets from his past, adding layers to the lore without leaving newcomers feeling adrift. The narrative begins with a simple premise: Kratos, mourning the loss of his wife, embarks on a journey with his son to scatter her ashes from the highest peak across all the realms. However, it's the unforeseen adventures encountered along this path that elevate the game's entertainment value.

The developers deserve applause for their portrayal of Kratos's raw Spartan strength. The graphics are nothing short of breathtaking, delivering a visually stunning world. The combat system, characterized by its brutality and rewarding mechanics, is a testament to the game's exceptional design. The joy of free-roaming, exploration, and stumbling upon puzzles within the vast open world is addictive, urging players to leave no stone unturned.

What truly sets God of War apart is the captivating array of characters. Each one is meticulously crafted, making them not only interesting but also genuinely lovable. Even those intended to be disliked contribute to the rich tapestry of the game, showcasing the developers' skill in world-building.

Upon each replay, my love for the game deepens. God of War's characters, combined with its stunning visuals, gripping combat, and engrossing narrative, create a beautiful and brutish single-player experience. In my book, it's a solid 10/10 – a recommendation without reservations for anyone yearning for a gaming adventure that transcends the ordinary.",1706923695,1706923695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

so i have come back for my full review, so far i have played 61+ hours and more still to go and have completed all the achievement and i'm playing it again on new game plus, everything in my first reveiw is accurate and the same but, to brush upon some new points.

1. first off the basis of the games amazing exploration, and the fact that the games gets characters telling u to explore, also the fact that when you are exploring for me it is fun and entertaining as well as really well done.

2. the story as I've stated before is really well constructed the goals can come off as a bit tedious if your looking at it in script form but because the game is real good looking and the voice acting is also well done including the actual interactions the characters have turns it into a fun experience, and the puzzles are interesting and innovative, they always keep you guessing.

3.the sound for me is so well done it not only fits so well to each scene and the themes but its also been a soundtrack i listen to on spotify my favourite tune is ashes played wen they cremate Atreus's mother.

4. i cant speak too much on the way the game looks but i played on low settings and the game still looked impressive and i wished i could see it on max. 

5. on the exploration, the collectables were fun most of the time i used videos to help but for me the game was so well done that i wanted to do all that was able to be done in the game and so i did, and planning on doing it again. 

all id have to say is this game was good to the point that i put in effort to give a decent review of all my thought and for £40 its an amazing bargain as well as an opportunity for you to fall in love with a new set of character and themes, it has also sparked a desire for me to want to play the original 3 GOW, amazingly i've heard they may be remastering the original 3 GOD OF WAR'S.",1704554466,1706915293,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

God of War tells an engaging story with weighty, satisfying combat; It's not a complicated game, but it empowers the player by navigating them from peak to valley to realm with so much depth hidden beneath its play and environments. 
Novices can enjoy the story of Kratos's redemption and occasional stumble through fatherhood, and Atreus's misconceptions on how to handle responsibility growing into adulthood. 
Intermediate and techy players can invest into the combinations of Kratos's move set to really kick the ass of bosses. 
It is shocking just how much detail was crafted into the world that even the albeit sparse overworld doesn't make you feel alone- which is to say that the graphics are stunning, and the dialogue and interactions are clever and funny.

This is not God Of War. It's not bad, but the gameplay elements that make it God Of War are not here. Enemies that would have been fodder mobs in the original games are almost treated as minibosses. It's basically just a Souls-like. Once upon a time I would have forgiven this in favour of the story, but it's just hard to reconcile that Kratos has gone from beating literal gods to death with his bare hands to fighting undead generic mobs on an equal level. The modern obsession with turning every game into cinema is too much. I'm not knocking anyone's performances, but I don't care how good the acting is if the gameplay is just a clone of Sekiro or any other melee-fighting based game out there.

So fast forward to now and I decided to give it another try on the Steam Deck.  I am glad I did.  It is a great game in its own right and the story is fantastic.  It does take some getting used to and it’s way more complicated upgrade wise.  It took me quite a while to get the hang of the upgrading.  I am not the biggest fan of open world games, but this one does have a fairly linear path you can choose to follow.  I did quite a lot of side quests as I felt the gear upgrades were necessary to finish the game.  The combat is gratifying, but I prefer the original gameplay more.  With that all said, I am very glad I gave the game a second chance and happy I stuck with it and wound up enjoying it very much.  The Steam Deck plays it pretty well, but  if I played for extended times it did crash about every 2 hours…not sure why as I did try different versions of Proton but it kept happening.  Not a huge deal and it forced me to take some needed breaks I suppose.  I would recommend this game, but you have to be willing and able to get over the fact that it’s just not the same as the original games.

I liked how the relationship between Kratos and Atreus progressed throughout the game. Not only that, the new characters introduced are also pretty good with Mimir being the standout character due to his stellar voice work. 

On the gameplay side of things, the combat is great with the exception of enemies being able to start their attacks offscreen, which is kinda annoying IMO. The game would really benefit from a DMC-esque system where only enemies you can see can start their attacks. Otherwise, the combat is good with quite a lot of variety in terms of moves and runic attacks.

I've been forced to replay so many fights because, for no apparent reason, the game will stop responding to my keyboard and mouse. I mean, i'm holding the D key to strafe right and out of nowhere Kratos just stops moving. I try to hit the key to do crits and randomly get no response. Not all the key binds do this. The attack bindings on the two primary mouse buttons never fail. But sometimes the scroll button does. I have NONE of these issues in any other game.

ALSO, sometimes dialogue audio just glitches out and goes silent. Sometimes it returns out of sync with character animations. Sometimes two pieces of dialogue that aren't supposed to play over each other just do that and one interrupts the other cutting it short. Something that makes the best part of the game, the story, harder to follow.

It's also YET ANOTHER PC PORT that has a windowed mode but allows the mouse cursor to travel outside the game window. Nothing better than having combat interrupted by an out of control cursor. I have 3rd party software that locks my cursor into a smaller movement grid during gameplay since i'm used to game companies not caring about it lately, but this shouldn't be the solution. GTAV had this covered on it's PC release nearly 9 years ago. There's no excuse.

Let me make this clear, when things work i'm having a 10 out of 10 time. The problem is, these little issues are happening constantly and ruining the overall experience for me. I love what I can get to work so I don't want to quit, but I spend half my time pulling my hair out with anger over tiny issues that should have been patched out in basic QC tests. 

I can't recommend such a great game in such poor condition. But I would love to change the thumb direction on this rating. Just have some respect for your PC players and fix this nonsense.",1706379714,1706544706,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was really excited before starting the game, mainly because I hadn't played any of the God of War games before. Also, I want to know how GOW became a GOTY rather than RDR2. The start was really great and the music also made me feel awesome from the beginning. Gradually, the game made me feel repetitive because of the same things again and again for almost half of the game.The story wasn't that kind of interesting. After getting the Blades of Chaos, the game was interesting. By the play through, the game was getting more and more interesting. But RDR2 is still far better than that. 

Even though this is also a great game, it comes with great graphics, great music, amazing gameplay+ combat and an average story. The character development and the Father+Son relationship are the only key elements in the story. 

The game will be in my Top 10 list, but I will not recommend it for the full price. At the offer price, it will be worth the money.

The game loves to waste your time with time-consuming animations and there is that terrible camera for combat. I would try the game, $30 is a good price.

Kratos' character direction I think while overall a very good one, that being an oldened wisened father, does lead to a lot of whiplash and disorientation considering that in the prequel he was revenge incarnate. It really feels like we are missing an entire game's worth of character development. If the devs ever wanted to make another game in this fashion, I do think a prequel to this one but taking place after the events of GoW3 would be a great jumping point. \

I am much more mixed on a number of the gameplay decisions made. On the one hand Runic attacks and different armor effects is a really nice change and there is no denying how good the combat can feel but with that being said. The RPG leveling elements just simply don't work. Me, being the GOD OF WAR struggling to fight a mob just because it's 3 levels higher feels AWFUL and that's not to mention how utterly useless 'Spartan Rage' is in this game. In the previous titles activating your rage mode felt amazing and powerful, annihilating hordes of enemies and shredding bosses. In this game however? It lets you punch and kick, slightly regenerate HP, takes way too long to fill for how helpful it is and also does terrible damage when compared to your arsenal. 

Let's talk about that camera.

This camera choice was bad. Like really bad. To try and get that 'Sony Exclusive' vibe going they made the camera OTS, which inherently is not a bad thing...Unless you are a hack 'n' slash, then it's terrible. The reason why the genre has a more zoomed out camera is since you are being attacked from all angles at various ranges so the camera helps you see what's going on at all times. Now while they could have adjusted combat to fit the OTS option they really didn't do that, many enemies, from many ranges will attack you at all times leading you to flinging your camera around trying to find something, and all they did to fix this blatant issue was the terrible band-aid of glowing arrows around Kratos which not only ruins the immersion they were trying to make with OTS but it also just feels bad to play with. For combat sections zooming out the camera by a considerate amount would have prevented this issue all together. It's a big flaw.

Story - This is a story about what it means to be a god, but also about what it means to be a man.

Christopher Judge in the role of Kratos fits with his deep muscular voice perfectly. Game starts with death of your wife and Atreus sees you as just non interesed father. The first 15 minutes says so much about the whole game, that its something different, something unique, that you never experienced before. Some really great twists are also present, like finding blades of chaos, revealing the truth about Freya/Baldurs relation or seeing Atreus's godess powers.

The story is just awesome and you're definetly gonna enjoy it.

Gameplay - Gameplay is made entirely from ground. The environments are beautifully detailed and contribute to the storytelling. Now your camera is not fixed, but its behind your back main weapon is axe, that your wife gave you, while she was still alive. You can upgrade your weapon and give it new attributes.

Eventually you'll unlock new armor, upgrades to your son and the blades of chaos.

Gameplay is phenomenal.

I still have some stuff left to unlock, but we'll see if I decide to do that or not. GoW allows you to play with either a controller or mouse and keyboard. Because I only have an Xbox controller and not a PlayStation controller, I chose to use mouse and keyboard. I am unsure if I could use my Xbox controller, but I just felt that using that instead of a PlayStation controller would be blasphemous, thus why I chose mouse and keyboard. By the time I realized mouse and keyboard sucks for this game, I was already 2+ hours in and did not want to replay the whole intro & tutorial just to relearn the controls. That said, use a controller over mouse and keyboard. I have read the gameplay experience is much better.

With that out of the way, this game is incredible. Dare say a masterpiece. My only two real issues is first, sometimes the story left me scratching my head due to not understanding what is happening or being told to me, but I chalked that up to just forgetting part of the story from earlier. Second, [spoiler] when Kratos gets his Blades of Chaos and tells Atreus that they are gods, Atreus does not ask any questions until later. Atreus basically shrugs his shoulders and says cool. Not once does he ask about the Blades of Chaos, not even later in the story. Kratos and Atreus do discuss their godlihood as the game progresses, but you'd think being a kid and finding out he is a god [/spoiler] that there would be a lot more questions and dialogue, but there isn't. Perhaps I am just nitpicking

I know the gist of the previous GoW games but I never had the chance to play them. That said, I plan to get a PS3 soon and play all of them. I know those games are different from this soft reboot/sequel in that this game is more cinematic and story driven where the previous entries are more button mashing, hack and slash, with quick time events, but I'm a man of lore and I would like to experience those games.

There isn't a single character in this game that I did not like, and that even goes for the [spoiler] World Serpent [/spoiler], as little (lol) as he might be. Okay, maybe I didn't like the gods that Kratos has a bone to pick, but those guys were written to be disliked, so they did a job well done. The [spoiler] two Dwarves [/spoiler] and [spoiler] Mimir [/spoiler] are probably my favorites, but even then that is a hard choice because Kratos and Atreus are so fantastic.

Overall, 9/10. Maybe don't buy full price unless you plan to 100% the game, and make sure you do not use mouse and keyboard!",1706216547,1706228007,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Simple reasons:
1. Game doesn't answer your questions. There's a cliffhanger which I hate for games specially when the main story is basically trash. There are various occasions where things are explained vaguely. The only reason I was even a little bit interested was probably due to the existence of Norse mythology in reality.
2. The Side quest are also bad. More like go there and kill some enemies and then repeat at a different location.
3. The armour, build system is also disappointing. 
4. The boss, a huge number of fights in the mail story line is interrupted by the cut scenes. Although epic looking but I am here to play the game, not watch the game.
5. Your side quest don't have any influence what so ever.

In short - I have nothing to remember this game by 3-4 years down the line Cause not even once 
did I rose from my chair in any sort of emotion what so ever.

I have mixed feelings of this game. The story is ok, but not great and very short on content, well synchronized in german language though. The developers streched the whole game up by useless grinding (I killed over 1000 enemies in like 20 hours).

Than, you are climbing, running and do quests a 5 year old can solve. They doesn't matter. The Devs just extend a 10 hours content into 20 to 40 like Ubisoft used to do it. It is so much grinding to upgrade your weapons and armor instead of finding nice ones. In the end I was just glad I finished the game.

Los cambios en el combate me resultaron positivos y la evolución del personaje de Kratos desde el juego anterior y a lo largo de este es super interesante y realmente, en cuanto a historia es un 10/10 en mi opinion.
Entra en la lista de mejores juegos que jugué. Aun no está terminado pero ya lo jugué hace 3 o 4 años en PS4 (Los tiempos de carga en mi SSD son mucho mas rapidos, y la optimización del juego esta de maravilla) y mi opinión rejugandolo ahora mismo no está cambiando.

Está seguido en oferta y así lo conseguí yo, pero realmente lo vale incluso sin la oferta si nunca lo jugaste.

Recomiendo encarecidamente si este es tu primer juego de la saga, buscar un resumen de la historia del God of War 1, 2 y 3 (Hay mas juegos pero no los veo tan necesarios) para tener un mayor contexto sobre el pasado de Kratos y entender un poco mas el por qué es como es y el contexto de muchas otras cosas que se verán en la historia de este juego. Es jugable sin saber nada del anterior, pero te perdés muchisimo en el camino. (Ya despues si te gustó este, podes jugar los otros en otra plataforma o incluso leer la historia del resto de los juegos)",1706048338,1706048338,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed it so much I 100%'d the achievements.

I'll give it a 9/10 

Oh you thought I would give it a 10/10?
Yeah, I thought so too.
The story and combat was very profound and breathtaking at some parts of the game.
It's just... there's this stupid enemy that teleport away from you whenever you try to attack it. 
They're called Revenants and you need Atreus to shoot them first to stagger them.
But even if you do that, you can only get a few hits in.... 

At one point of the game, the game made me fight THREE DAMAGE SPONGE REVENANTS AT ONCE
WHY!???? JUST WHY
I WOULDN'T MIND FIGHTING ALL THE VALKYRIES AT ONCE, AT LEAST I CAN HIT THEM

但在另一方面，战神4的开放世界和RPG设计略显折磨。地图复杂且有些重复，传送点得等到游戏后期才能解锁，所以前期的探索体验相当冗长，经常得划着船满地图跑，时不时还会遇到等级压制的怪物被秒杀。一些开放世界的探索设计有一点罐头的感觉，流程都大差不差。支线任务故事性则不太够，打完之后还没有战斗的过程给人的印象深，任务奖励也很一般。所以角色成长方面，如果想要打女武神就必须获得强力的装备，而这些装备往往需要大量的时间和精力去刷重复的挑战以获得素材，这一点毫无疑问是减分项。",1705855355,1705855355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The acting is phenomenal, the child actor does an amazing job. The fluidity of gameplay is next level. Some of the best gore and finisher animations I've ever seen, and they blend so well with everything. Every single cut scene is moment to moment, no black screens so you never get lost in the story. The plot twist never end, and I love it. I would gasp as some of these moments, so unexpected.

The voice actor for Kratos must have been ejected with bull semen this guy sounds unreal (fits his character, although there's a slight accent that comes up from time to time).

Amazing game, quality-wise on a similar level Horizon Zero Dawn. I come to this game with little to no expectations, because the genre was not really my cup of tea, but boy was I surprised. I got completely immersed and loved every little bit of content, just didn't want to pit it down, 40 hours in a week and I loved every moment. The world traversing wasn't as free as e.g. in Horizon, it is a different genre after all, but definitely still open-world and you can explore/progress at you own pace.

- gorgeous landscapes together with beautiful graphics
- immersive well thought out fully curated missions, both main and optional!
- interesting stories and dialogs about lore every time you ride a boat, I've yet to hear them all
- various collectibles and accomplishments that will naturaly keep you going
- nice variety of enemy classes, good amount of bosses

Fun fact: using any DLSS actually makes the game looks much better then native imo, on close objects you won't see any difference and everything further out which is natively rendered blurry gets sharpened and cleared out.

Technical notes:
- ""technically"" playable on Steam Deck but with really low graphics and 30-ish fps, I just didn't bother.
The PC experience is infinitely better in both visual (HDR, DLLS, high resolution and fps) and controls aspect (mouse + keyboard felt much better given the number and complexity of controls)

What baffles me is the unique combat system they crafted, which unfortunately falls flat unless you're practicing solo. Standing still and waiting a full second to unleash combat skills feels like a major misstep.

The overall design of the fights turns combat into a grind, reaching extreme levels of repetition. It seems like they leaned heavily into puzzles, but they're so straightforward that even the average 35-year-old dad could breeze through them with some Viking themes sprinkled on top.

To make matters worse, most enemies turn into sponges on difficulties above the story setting, and even some basic enemies become a tedious slog. The lack of variety among enemies contributes to a sense of laziness, with mostly reskinned foes repeating the same predictable skills.

Overall, it's a rather mediocre experience. I've grown so bored, especially with the clunky and self-hating combat, that I can't stand it any longer.",1643649155,1705496536,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

God of War transcends the boundaries of video game storytelling, delivering a profoundly emotional narrative wrapped in the cloak of intense action. Kratos, once a Spartan warrior seeking vengeance, is transformed into a nuanced and deeply human character, navigating the challenging terrain of fatherhood in the haunting Norse realms. This reinvention of the series doesn't just showcase evolution in gameplay mechanics but a mature, gripping storyline that explores themes of redemption and the complexity of family relationships.

The game's technical prowess is a visual feast, with breathtaking landscapes and meticulously crafted details that breathe life into the Norse mythology-inspired world. The single-shot camera technique not only provides a seamless, cinematic experience but serves as a storytelling device, ensuring that players are entirely immersed in the journey of Kratos and Atreus. The combat system, a ballet of brutality, manages to strike a perfect balance between accessibility and depth, making every encounter a thrilling spectacle.

God of War stands as a testament to the potential of video games as an art form.

It's a level of boring that I could never have even imagined. It was enough to make me start hating this game I had grown to love, not exaggerating in the slightest. Trying to max out armor became such a miserable slog I had to actually say to myself ""what am I doing, this is such an utter waste of time"" and hurry back to main story, which is fantastic.

I love the way how it points you directions in the story, all the while making it have this weird illusion of freedom, like as if you were finding ""the things to do"" yourself, while still making it perfectly clear on what your supposed to do next, It's hard to explain but the game really immerses me so much to the point that it felt like a genuine experience.

If I'm being honest, I really love Kratos, but the lore, the story, the setting- most especially, just isn't my cup of tea, I'm not a huge fan of mythical creatures, enchantresses, Gods and whatever else kind of trope when it comes to games, it's simply my own personal taste, what's even funnier is that while this isn't a ""souls-game"", it has a slight soulslike factor to it with its combat, which, I, am not a big fan of as well.
It's amazing to me how on paper, all of the things God Of War is, it's not my taste when it comes to games.
Yet I really enjoyed this, it was cinematic, it got me hooked more than anything else, and I must say that this game has one of THE BEST combats- if not, the BEST combat I've ever had in a game, it was a perfect mixture of just, it being simple and easy to learn, yet still having some bits here and there where skill is a must, and a learning curve in your movements, especially finding out different combos and such, I genuinely can't explain how satisfying and fun it is to fight in this game. It makes you feel like a bad-ass every single second yet at the same time, it's not just mindless button mashing as you still have to focus on the combat to truly win those battles that can be easily lost in just two hits.

I have never really played any GoW game before, I've played all three but only a few hours of them, never really diving into the lore, nor even getting halfway of any of these games, so I don't know much about Kratos or the world of GoW, but I know *enough* to create a concept in my head on what is happening.
While all that is, it didn't really confuse me as it felt kind of friendly to newcomers as well, taken in a world where Kratos has, assuming, retired- You're taken into the eyes of a new beginning of some sort, even the ""lorebook"" was written by Atreus and I find that a neat touch, it's like as if it's meant to be like that, yet while still holding a deep connection with the games before yet, yet still feeling like an entirely new thing now.

One thing that I really like is how the older games were a Hack n' Slash where combat is incredibly easy, and you felt like just an absolute boss whenever you come across anybody, then when I came to this game, I was shocked as I could've swore the combat wasn't like this back then, not even close- I was taken aback at first, thinking that maybe I've made a grave mistake playing this game but immediately fell in love with it, and I like the thought that it's like this now since Kratos wasn't the man who he used to be, making combat, still a badass at it, all-the-while just a little bit more difficult with a few more technicalities, which feels about right for this new older Kratos, unlike before where he was just an absolute killing machine, I really love that.

I can't say I'll ever play any other GoW, a part of me still am not a fan of these kind of things, the gameplay, story, and everything- but this may very well just be one of the best games I've played in a long while.
I decided to not continue any more after the main mission because of it as well, but I hope to someday come back to this game and perfect it, completing every single little task, and gaining everything there is to the game, I feel this game would be so much more enjoyable like that, but I'll leave that for next time.

One greatest thing I could say about this game is its absolute AMAZING sound design, everything from the music, to the voices, to the sound effects are just straight up orgasmic, I could probably just sit down and hack my way through things just for the sake of enjoying the world of it, the sounds really bring out a lot and always do I feel shivers down my spine when I meet with evil, or hell, the World Serpent, all!
It's incredibly fun and makes me all giggly.

This game is absolutely amazing in each and every single way- I can't point out a single thing that I would even change, or even say that is slightly bad, or could've been improved on, it is AMAZING. Period.

There's nothing I can say that I disliked about it, other than it just not being my perfect game due to my tastes.

Game play feels really good, fighting feels really polished and enjoyable, and the puzzles using your weapons are really creative and make you think to solve them.  The story is very interesting and having the main cast of characters grow in such unique ways really makes you feel for them, and gets you really invested in what's happening. For people new to the series or experienced in the previous games, I believe that this was an amazing game and definitely worth playing.

For these reasons I would recommend it but the gameplay mechanics themselves kind of suck, at least for PC. There is a New Play+ feature that lets you continue playing the game (starting over while keeping your gear and stuff) but I don't see the point. It's boring outside the main story. There are a whole set of elements that are useless. Outside of a couple items you craft and maybe some upgrades the entire crafting and resource gathering is beyond pountless. The idea of selling and buying items is also pointless. Outside of the starting gear, there wasnt much of a point to upgrade until mid-game (Tyr Armor) and the late Mist Armor just makes everything easy.



Unpopular opinion, it's a good story wrapped in bad gameplay. First impression was getting a headache from the obnoxious camera shake that as if they tried to provide a POV from a dude with Parkinson's. Seriously hold the perspective steady instead of shaking the screen like a 4 year old who got a hold of their dad's VHS video recorder.

The gameplay mechanics are clunky and most of the enemies are one trick ponies, it's annoying to enter a fight with a new opponent only to basically be one shot because you have no idea how to fight them, only to then be swarmed mid-fight by random respawns of enemies that come from literally no where to ruin the fun.More like reload checkpoint simulastor.

Low on health after a fight with no means of healing? No big deal, just let your character die at the next checkjpoint so you can reload with full health, it's totally not immersion breaking. In fact 99% of the game is immersion breaking. I see now why they have a difficulty specifically for the story. I went in at the second highest because I like a challenge but this is just boring and old. I'll drop it to the lowest and suffer through the boring gameplay to see how the story plays out.

I'm glad I got it during the Steam sale but to be frank, just skip this, you arent missing anything.",1701153621,1705378092,True,0,0,0.455150485038757324,0,True,False,False

I am so glad to have finally gotten around to this game after hearing so much about it. The game has some of the best combat in a game I have experienced in a long time, that is polished but requires practice and skill in order to learn, making you feel competitive and wanting to improve. It is much different than games like Spider-Man or the Arkham series. The greatest thing about the environment/world is the grand scale. It doesn't just look big, it feels big. Everything from the world serpent to the mountain peaks looks amazing, and it feels so expansive despite the game being played on a computer screen. The dialogue and voice acting is amazing, serving the story completely and making all characters, even minor ones, memorable. And the story is engaging, I can say it has been a while since a game has made me want to play it and not do anything else. 

I will need more time to reflect on this experience, but I absolutely recommend playing this game even if you never played the games before.

There's never a lull in the plot and it made me keep returning to play the game every day after work. World building is very skilfully done and the rewards and collectibles do not feel lame like they tend to do in some story driven action games. 

The armour system was a mixed bag for me. Even though I kept improving my armour steadily as I progressed through the main story and did a few side quests here and there, I found the higher tier armour to not necessarily look as good or as ""legendary"" as I had hoped. I wish there was a transmog system where I could put on the highest tier armour pieces I owned with the best stats but visually mix and match the pieces I actually liked the look of. 

The combat gameplay is satisfying and there is a wide swathe of unlockable moves and runic attacks but it does get repetitive very soon due to the narrow enemy variety. I found myself unable to remember most of the advanced moves I unlocked in each of the weapon skill trees and stuck to only a few of them. Things get interesting if you decide to face all bosses of a certain type in the optional side quests. These bosses can and will kick your ass but do not expect amazing rewards after beating them all. Overcoming that challenge is supposed to be the real reward. The main story boss fights are a cakewalk in comparison.

I had no issues with the performance of the game on my PC, not even any frametime stutters which are unfortunately commonplace in modern open-world AAA games on PC. I didn't have even a single crash. The only major miss in this PC port is the lack of customizable FOV. The default FOV in this game is awful and would give me motion sickness during combat until I discovered that I could increase the FOV using a modding tool called Flawless Widescreen. I increased the FOV by 25%, and then everything was good.

Overall I was very pleased with the game entirely because of the story and lore and am looking forward to Ragnarok whenever it gets released on PC. I hope Santa Monica does better with the side quests, armour system and main story boss variety in the next one.",1705162002,1705162002,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First and foremost, the narrative is a tour de force. Kratos, once an indiscriminate god-killer, is reborn as a father and mentor to his son, Atreus. The transformation of Kratos from a vengeful god to a more nuanced and complex character is a triumph of character development. The emotional depth and growth exhibited by both Kratos and Atreus throughout the journey are nothing short of extraordinary. The narrative unfolds seamlessly, weaving together Norse mythology with a deeply personal and poignant father-son tale that keeps players emotionally invested from start to finish.

Visually, God of War is a spectacle to behold. The breathtaking landscapes of the Norse realms are rendered with meticulous detail. The character models, especially Kratos and Atreus, are stunningly realistic, and the creature designs are nothing short of awe-inspiring. Every frame feels like a living, breathing painting, immersing players in a world that feels both mythical and grounded.

The combat system is a triumph of fluidity and brutality. Kratos' Leviathan Axe is not just a weapon but an extension of the player's will, with each swing and throw feeling weighty and impactful. The addition of Atreus as a combat ally introduces a strategic layer to the battles, making encounters dynamic and engaging. The upgrade system is robust, allowing players to tailor Kratos' abilities to their preferred playstyle. From epic boss battles to smaller skirmishes, the combat in God of War is a symphony of chaos and control.

The soundtrack elevates the emotional resonance of the game to new heights. The Norse-inspired score complements the game's setting perfectly, enhancing the sense of grandeur and tension. The voice acting as Kratos, is top-notch, bringing the characters to life with nuance and authenticity.

God of War is more than just a game... It's a cinematic odyssey that redefines what is possible in interactive storytelling. It's a testament to the power of video games as an art form, seamlessly blending stunning visuals, compelling narrative, and satisfying gameplay. Santa Monica Studio has not only revived a beloved franchise but has set a new standard for excellence in the gaming industry. God of War is a triumph that will be remembered for years to come.",1705112319,1705112319,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This God Of War is nothing less than a masterpiece. Never have I ever felt so much like a raging bald man IRL. Fully deserved it''s game of the year award. Hat's off. 

Pros 

- Rewarding and Unbelievable Smooth Combat with a boat load of different play styles to use. 
- Amazing story which set's a different path from the carnage Kratos once caused in Sparta. 
- Amazing and Replayable exploration
- Almost every side quest, Action rewards you for your efforts with XP, Gear or Lore. So practically everything in this game feels like progression or meaningful learning. 
- Great Bosses, Companions and Well Written Characters. 


Cons

- Some enemies are cheap and somewhat Ebola Tier to fight (Revenants, Watchers and oh god.,..the Alfheim Fairy Guards...)

As a longtime fan of action games, I was thrilled when ""God of War"" finally made its way to PC, and it didn't disappoint. This isn't just a simple port; it's a well-optimized experience that brings Kratos' epic journey to life on a new platform.

Graphics and Performance:
First off, the game looks stunning on PC. The graphics are sharp, and the attention to detail in the game's world is impressive. Running on a mid-range setup, I experienced smooth gameplay with very few hiccups. The higher frame rates on PC make the combat even more fluid and satisfying than I remember on consoles.

Story and Characters:
The narrative of ""God of War"" remains its strongest point. It's a deep, engaging story that masterfully blends action with emotional depth. Watching the relationship between Kratos and Atreus evolve over the course of their journey adds a unique layer to the game that goes beyond typical action titles. Their interactions and growth are as compelling as the battles and exploration.

Gameplay:
The combat system is robust and enjoyable. With a mix of melee attacks, combos, and magical abilities, it offers enough variety to keep things interesting throughout the game. The PC controls are well-mapped, and I found them to be intuitive and responsive, though I occasionally switched to a controller for a more relaxed experience.

Puzzles and Exploration:
Beyond combat, the game offers a good balance of puzzles and exploration. The puzzles are clever without being frustrating, and exploring the different realms provides a nice break from the intensity of the main story quests.

Sound and Music:
The sound design and music are top-notch. The orchestral score elevates the epic feel of the game, and the sound effects add an immersive quality, especially during combat.

Final Thoughts:
""God of War"" on PC is an excellent port of an already fantastic game. It combines a compelling story, satisfying combat, and beautiful visuals into a package that feels right at home on PC. Whether you're a fan of the series or new to Kratos' story, this game is a must-play.",1704857984,1704857984,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first the combat felt very limited but once stuff was upgraded more it became my favorite part of the game. Atreus is a well executed assist character. The puzzles I could go either way.  As the main story is quite long, I feel I paid a fair price for good content, not just grinding or treasure hunting. The mythology and storytelling while traveling are a nice touch to motivate you to explore without becoming bored.

I should note that although it ran smoothly at max graphics on my steam deck, I experienced on average 1 crash an hour. I think it was related to autosaves, but it may also have had to do with the system heating up over time.

The writing is so damn good! And all the while the game-play keeps being engaging and challenging, without ever feeling unreasonable.  I thought it was awesome. To the point that I actually want to do the content that remains after I finished the main story-line, which is something that I basically never do.

And the world design! Holy crap, its so cool! The Lake of Nine is such an awesome concept and is so fantastically easy to get around, yet always remains diverse and always exciting! Won't say more, for the sake of spoilers, but this game has done something truly special here.

ข้อดี
- กราฟริคต้องบอกว่าสวยงาม รายละเอียดแน่นตามท้องเรื่อง

- ระบบการต่อสู้ดี คอมเบทบังคับง่ายขนาดใช้คีร์บอดเล่น ที่เป็นไฮไลท์ของมันก็คือการอัพเกรดชุดเกราะ อาวุธ ต่างๆ ที่ไม่ง่าย และ ไม่ยากจนเกินไป ทำให้การเล่นเกมไม่น่าเบื่อ ต้องคอยหาทรัพยากรต่างๆมาอัพเกรด มีชาแลนจ์ต่างๆมา ทำให้ไม่น่าเบื่อเพราะ รางวัลทีได้มันสำคัญมากๆ ทุกๆหีบ ทุกๆการรูตของล้วนสำ

- เนื้อเรื่องเหมือนจะไม่มีอะไรมาก แค่พาเถ้าแม่ไปปล่อยที่ภูเขา แต่เสน่ห์ของมันคือ รายละเอียดระหว่างทางที่ต้องเจอกับคนแคระ ตำนาน สัตว์เทพนิยาย เรื่องเล่าปรำปรา อดีตของแต่ละที่ที่เราไปล้วนน่าสนใจ

ข้อเสีย
- ศัตรูทีค่อนข้างซ้ำ
- เนื้อเรื่องจริงคือสั้นมาก แต่จะไปหนักกับเกมเพลย์ระหว่างทางเลย เหมือนว่าเกมจะยาว

-----------------------------------------------------

After playing the game for more than 50 hours, It has been an incredibly enjoyable experience, and I struggle to explain the feeling of immersing myself in the realm of Nordic gods.

GOOD:

- The graphics are undeniably beautiful, replete with details that align seamlessly with the narrative.

- The combat system is commendable, offering an easily navigable experience even with keyboard controls. 

- The standout feature lies in upgrading armor and diverse weapons. This dynamic keeps the gameplay engaging, necessitating the acquisition of various resources for upgrades and confronting diverse challenges —an endeavor that strikes a balance between being challenging yet not overly difficult. 

- The presence of meaningful rewards, whether from chests or hidden roots, adds significant value to each gaming session.

BAD:

- The enemies faced tend to be somewhat repetitive.
- Despite the richness of the world, the actual story line is surprisingly brief. However, this brevity is offset by the immersive game play, creating the impression that the game is more extensive than its narrative might suggest",1704728049,1704728049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The plot in this game is simple, the characters are complex, and if you know me that's the type of shit that gets me going, right out of the gate you meet Baldur with one of the most exhilarating boss fights i have ever experienced, then boom, you hate that motherfucker, you are aware of the fighting system and you care for your son, now, partner in battle, just a perfect start.

Combat is brutal and skillfull, it takes a while until you feel like the old Kratos again, but when you do get that feeling... it's special, the only bad thing about the combat is the mini-bosses, i think we have like 3 or 4 different minibosses throughout the whole game, thats kinda boring, but its a minor issue in the big scope of the amount of extra content this game brings you.

The feeling of exploration in this game is like no other, you are just sucked in into these little islands and caves and when you are aware again you have lost 3 hours doing side stuff, that is just as good as the main dish, with dragons to free, valkyries to beat and new areas to discover, unlike Red Dead, the open world feels like an extension of the main story in GOW.

So let's break it down, i finished this game, i beat 4 valkyries already, now i have other 4 (5) valkyries to beat, i already did all side quests, and i still have like 65% completion, there is a whole new reign (and i'm pretty sure there is one more) that i just discovered where i'm experiencing a whole new game with a new level of difficulty that is making me question if i should continue because i die every 15min (losing all gathered resources)

I can't wait to touch GOW Ragnarok as i heard the only problem i have with this game has been fixed (variety of minibosses)

First off, the visuals are BEAUTIFUL. Holy shit dude, they are amazing. I feel like I'm really in the world of Midgard, and its surrounding 9 realms.
Second, the voice acting is great. You can truly feel the raw emotion of the characters, especially Kratos. he doesn't speak too much, but when he does, you can really feel it.
third, the combat. Holy fucking shit, god damn. The combat is AMAZING. Its a bit tough to get used to it, but once you do, you can have an absolute BLAST. And that just improves once you get the blades of chaos, getting a good combo on an enemy is an absolutely AWESOME thing to do, throwing an enemy up in the air and then pulling them down with your chains, then pulling yourself closer to them to do MASSIVE damage, and then boxing them with close range blades, absolute ecstasy, thats what that is.
and finally, the story. I'm not going to say much, because I can't say much. And thats not saying that theres no story, what it means is that there is SO MUCH GOOD FUCKING STORY, that I can't even describe it.

Santa Monica Studio has taken the series in a bold new direction, and the result is a breathtaking experience that surpassed all my expectations. Graphically, the game is a showcase of testing PC's capabilities and I recommend it as the baseline . The environments are stunningly detailed, from the towering peaks of Midgard to the dark realms of Helheim. To the Eleven home of Alfheim, the challenges of Muspelheim and Niflheim. The character models, especially Kratos,Atreus, and cant forget Mimir exhibit an incredible level of realism.The narrative is a triumph. Kratos' journey through Norse mythology is not just a spectacle of violence; it's a deeply emotional and poignant story of fatherhood, redemption, and the weight of one's past. The addition of Atreus as a companion adds a layer of complexity to the gameplay and tugs at the heartstrings with their evolving father-son dynamic. Which reminds me of me and my Father who I've never been super close with but have now. Combat is a revelation. The Leviathan Axe is a joy to wield, providing a satisfying mix of power and finesse. The shift to a more methodical combat style is a welcome change, requiring strategy and skill rather than button-mashing. The variety of enemies and the challenging boss battles keep the combat fresh and engaging throughout. The open-world design enhances the sense of exploration. Midgard feels alive with secrets, puzzles, and side quests that add depth to the overall experience. The interconnected realms and the lore scattered throughout the game kept me invested which i'm almost 100% with the game.I appreciate the pacing of the game. It seamlessly weaves together moments of intense action, exploration, and quieter, character-driven scenes. The musical score is exceptional, complementing the emotional beats of the story and the epic scale of the journey. God of War (2018) isn't just a game; it's an interactive masterpiece that sets a new standard for storytelling in the medium. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, this game is an absolute must-play it's honestly one of the greatest games/story's ever.God i cant wait for Ragnarök.

The voice acting at all moments makes this world come alive and this provides epic moments that you feel completely immersed in. I truly can sing praises about this game and I refuse to spoil anything, because I do not want to take the experience away from anyone else.

The only complaint I can muster is that the final boss is really really easy if you finish all of the side content first. This isn't because you are upgraded super high (though that indeed adds to it), but because the side content is FAR more difficult than the final boss. The most difficult boss in the game is not the final boss by far, and the boss in question is one of the most difficult I have experienced in any game. By the time you return to the main story line your skills have increased greatly and the final boss becomes really trivial, though the spectacle is awesome.

Beyond this slight change in expectation, the entire game is masterful and I can only wait impatiently for the next installment to come to PC.

The combat system, ironically, is not very strong, after being what defined God of War, along with its spectacular, brutal and exaggerated scenes.

The closing of the game was a bit disappointing, especially because they make a basic writing error: if you show a gun, the gun must be fired. Obviously I'm not talking about this literally, God of War is not a shooter (although it can be if you try hard and have enough patience).

The RPG systems are fine, nothing incredible or new. I give, however, not two, but my 4 thumbs up to the fact that the game is one continuous shot, without cuts or loading screens.

The dialogue is wonderful and the voice artists were amazing.

If you're looking for fast-paced action, this may not be the right game, as you'll few challenging situations, even on the highest difficulty. However. If you want a good story, similar to watching a long movie, this may be what you want.

The core gameplay has you playing from an over-the-shoulder perspective as you hack, slash & bash your way through foes in front of you. Off to your side, your son Atreus will assist in combat when and where he can. Warning you of incoming projectiles or attacks from behind, or if an enemy risks afflicting Kratos with an ailment. Outside of combat, you’ll be running, jumping, climbing and solving puzzles as you progress through the game’s world in a mostly-linear fashion.

The story is, simply put, incredible. Kratos must venture forth to the highest summit in all of Midgard to spread the ashes of his wife Faye, as this was her last wish. Accompanying him on his journey is their son Atreus, whom along the way must learn to become stronger, smarter and more independent as the world before him is unrelenting and unforgiving.

Making their way to the mountaintop sounds, at first, like a very middling story. However, this adventure quickly tests them and forces them to depend on one-another, something Kratos had never before had to contend with. Throughout their journey, the two encounter many interesting characters, and the world begins to brim with life. Both with the characters they meet, and the tales they soon learn, discovering the history of the world which they must call home.

As a narrative, the game works as a pseudo-reboot of the original series, working independently whilst also maintaining implicit and explicit ties to Kratos’ past. You do not need to play the original games to appreciate the story, but for those who have, it will be an even richer experience.

[h1][b]Performance[/b][/h1]
The game looks & runs incredibly well, I’m happy to say. Its configuration options leave little to be desired, and it even has presets for running the game in “Original” graphics mode, which uses the same settings as the PS4 version of the game. I was able to run the game on Ultra with an RTX 3090 and maintain 120 FPS at 2560x1440, with no hitches, stutters or dips throughout. To accomplish this, I set DLSS to Quality, using the latest (at the time) version of 2.5.1. This image reconstruction looks better than native, and the performance boost is modest, taking me from 90-100 FPS, to a locked 120.

Performance scales excellently too, allowing me to reach over 200 FPS if certain settings are turned down. Load times are nearly nonexistent after boot, and the game plays incredibly smoothly.

[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]
Overall, [i][b]God of War[/b][/i] is an amazing experience from start to finish. It only takes ~50 hours to complete all that the game has to offer (including all achievements) and doesn’t overstay its welcome. The combat is fantastic, the boss fights are fun, the challenges are fair, the performance is excellent, and the story is amazing.

For those who are comfortably with over-the-shoulder games, this is a must-play!",1675062893,1704481924,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

    [*]Incredible story with rich detailed environments and dialogue; main story is self-contained from side-content and does not require adept understanding of gameplay mechanics to enjoy the experience
    [*]Very deep lore that expands and centres on Norse mythological gods and the establishment of them in the story, the Greek gods/world does also exist but is not the focal
    [*]Graphics and animations are smooth, very rare stutters/lags, gameplay is incredibly responsive and sound design is perfection
    [*]Skill trees and gearing are very linear and do not require heavy investment to succeed in the world
    [*]Combat is easy to learn & difficult to master, once you play around with different inputs you find interesting combos to chain together
    [*]Runic attacks, pommels, and talismans can make for interesting combos that accelerate in certain damage types
    [*]Kratos, Atreus, & Mimir are a fantastic well-designed cast of protagonists

[b]Rating: 6/10 - Fine[/b]

This game commits the possibly worst sin any game can commit; it's boring. Just plain boring. The game is filled with tedious walking and talking sections that really don't do much beside delivering dialogue, a lot of which just feels so damn awkward. Combat feels clunky and is, due to the minuscule amount of enemy variety, just as boring as the rest of the game which just consists of the most brain dead ""puzzles"" and walking sections where a story pretending to be great is delivered to you with voice acting way too good for it. The entire story is based on emotions caused by the death of a character I simply don't give a shit about because I didn't fucking know her. And you never really get to know her because the writers seemed to have forgotten the first rule of writing: [b]Show, don't tell[/b]. And then you're constantly annoyed with needless comments from that annoying, worthless little wretch Atreus whose entire point in the game seems to be to be annoying. I get it that he is supposed to be a grieving son, but it's still annoying to see him do and/or say some stupid shit every 10 seconds. This drags down a story based on emotional investment I can't have even more. It still has it's moments, features some good characters - even though all of them are introduced with terrible pacing, meaning that about 3 seconds after meeting them you're already buddy buddy with them because fuck getting to know someone. The only outstanding things about this game are the voice acting and the soundtrack. Just a boring slog.",1704302685,1704302685,False,7,0,0.487222433090209961,0,True,False,False

God of War (2018) is a phenomenally crafted piece of entertainment that blends the believable father-son story with a breathtaking soundtrack and very good graphics. 

This is the first God of War game I have personally played, and though I have always been aware of the series, this was my first jump into a journey with Kratos. As a newcomer, I felt that the game did a great job getting me accustom to the world with its lore explanations, character explanations, and clear indications of the end goal. The game did a surprisingly remarkable job at making me care for Kratos as a character, as he's always been known as a killing machine in the other games, as far as I'm aware, with nothing else really going on around him; so this was very pleasant to see. I feel the whole story holds up really well in fact.

As already mentioned, Bear Mccreary's compositions are masterfully constructed, with the main theme stuck in my head! 

95% of this game was an amazing time, but there were some gripes.

My main gripe is with how the game handles combat. For the most part, it's extremely satisfying to perform all the gruesome moves that Kratos has at his disposal, however, there are times where I felt I was unfairly robbed of health due to some jankyness; and I feel this is primarily the fault of the camera - it often feels way too close to Kratos, leading to a lot of times where combat can feel incredibly claustrophobic. I feel the devs knew this was an issue as well as they opt to have a reticle around Kratos that adapts colours depending when enemies would attack Kratos, and the quick-turn button. And while these are useful features, the reticle, in my opinion, could have been greatly aided by a further drawn back camera so that the player can see more around them, and the quick-turn being a D-pad button feels really awkward to use during intense fights, leading me to rarely ever using it.

I also felt that the last hour or two hurt the game's pacing. A lot of things you do towards getting to Jötunheim just feel like roadblocks for the sake of padding out the game's runtime when it could have easily wrapped up a lot sooner than it did. 

And lastly, while it didn't happen much during my playthrough, I did encounter 3 game crashes that sort of took me out the experience a little.

Apart from these small issues that I had, like I said, this was an incredible time from start to end. Santa Monica did an incredible job on this game, and I'm certainly going to be jumping back in very soon to complete some more side quests and upgrade my gear!",1704267890,1704267890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For starters, Revenants are incredibly annoying enemies. But that's only a minor gripe.
The real issues with this game are primarily centered around the absolutely suffocating quantities of collectibles and backtracking paired with all the grinding required to get some of the late game gear (and the Muspelheim grinding is easily the absolute worst). Not to mention the disproportionate amount of gear you get compared to upgrade materials. 

Though on more positive notes;
The final boss and ending are phenomenal, rewarding, and fun. Another highlight of the game is the banter. I love listening to Atreus and (The) Head talk about Norse Myhtos and stories (even though they have taken a fair number of liberties with it).

I'm sure that there are games out there with better combat systems or more detailed open worlds, but God of War stuck out to me because unlike other games, there's really nothing to gripe about. The combat and mechanics are fleshed out and fun without being insanely hard to learn. Builds have variety but aren't extremely complicated. Puzzles are engaging and often take a second to think about, but nothing is so complicated that the average gamer would need a walk through. Where God of War actively shines, however, is in its story. This game finds a balance that other games struggle to achieve, with a story that is compelling without being convoluted or overly lengthy.

I'm running an RTX 4070 and 32 GB RAM, and it easily hits 100 fps in Ultra settings at 1440p. The graphics alone made this worth the purchase at sale price. But the combat and the story take it to the next level. The combat is so satisfying and hard hitting, especially with a subwoofer near your feet and controller feedback. Play this game LOUD or with headphones. I'm using a controller so can't speak to how it performs on keyboard and mouse. I only had one crash/freeze in about 20 hrs of play so far, and that was during the first dragon battle, which is INTENSE. I turned of DLSS and haven't had any other issues, and it may have just been coincidence. I can't get over the scale of the game and how everything makes this huge, muscular main character look tiny.

God Of War 2018 is a stunning single player open world although very linear experience set in ancient Scandinavia focused the realm of Midgard, With unreal world building and in depth lore and character building focused around the main protagonist Kratos and his son Atreus. This incredible game boasts about 30 hours of campaign gameplay where you will learn all about this world and its characters featuring a huge roster of historic figures including many famous Nordic Gods. This game kept me glued to my screen from start to completion unlike many other games I have played before.
What the game lacks in certain mechanics it more than makes up for in an incredible story, In depth lore, Lovable characters, An incredible sense of adventure and it will make you feel like a real god! This game will catch all fans the RPG, Open world genre hook line and sphincter!

God of war is amazing! I played the original trilogy and was excited to finally play this game now that it's on PC. There is something about this game that the creators did so right, it brings out an anger in me while playing it, the good kind of anger and it manifests at the same time that Kratos rages and then beats the snot out of the enemy during a provoking cut scene. 

The puzzles are unique and sometimes had me stumped sometimes a little longer than I would like to admit, but it was never too hard or easy of a puzzle. The designs of the puzzles feel fun to complete especially when the two brain cells finally get it and everything falls into place.

The graphics look great, and the environment is fun to explore. I was always happy to come back and revisit old areas when I earned new weapons that opened previously locked chests and paths. The story is compelling and it always felt like I had a good reason for what I was doing next, but also giving plenty of chances to go side questing without seeming like it didn't make sense.

The weapons are fun to use and satisfying when you get a kill animation or a perfect parry. The game also allows you to build for straight damage, stun, or runic attacks which is nice to have the custom ability that wasn't seen in the original trilogy.

I think the best part of God of War are the characters, especially the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. The conversations between the two feel like real people with real problems and not a poorly written script. We also see great character development not only in both Kratos and Atreus, but also smaller side characters such as the Dwarven brothers that makes the progress throughout the story all the more satisfying.

A couple of minor downsides I feel that are worth mentioning is that first, if you're not using a controller and are rebinding controls for mouse and keyboard, there are certain buttons such as 2 that aren't initially bound to anything because it's for something later in the game, but if you rebind something to one of these buttons it resets all of your bindings without telling you what isn't working or why. This isn't game breaking but it was a little frustrating when I was adjusting bindings in the beginning. Another minor problem I had is that the field of view is not adjustable, it's pretty close and you can mostly only see over Kratos' right shoulder, limiting your view a bit. A friend says it's to add to the challenge, but to me if that's the case why isn't it at least an option to adjust it just like the difficulty setting? Again these are just minor complaints I think were at least worth a mention and do not break or ruin the game.

The game is overall amazing and I Highly recommend this game especially for people that enjoy story driven games with compelling characters and also wish they could drop a skyscraper onto their enemies when things don't go their way. Can't wait to play Ragnarok!

Felt like a walking simulator since the pace is so slow and the characters, at least at face value seem really boring. The combat is good but it's not like it's any better than most action/souls-like games these days, and it's simply too rare. For the most part you're just doing linear climbing, travelling, sailing, and 'solving' puzzles that are so simple a four year old could figure them out, but to just make the whole experience even more infuriating the characters will just tell you the answer before you even begin the puzzle. For the first few you're like ""ok, it's just the tutorial so fair enough"" but then they just keep doing it! 

My whole time with this game just felt like I was waiting to get to the good bit. After about 13 hours I just don't think there's going to be a good bit. Way too many boring cutscenes where no character establishing or development occurs. Excited boy is excited, grumpy dad is grumpy. I'm sure there's a good story somewhere in the game, but I don't have the patience to have it drip fed to me while having my time wasted with countless sections of slow pointless 'puzzles', climbing, walking, etc.

Developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, this reimagining of the iconic series transcends its hack-and-slash roots, offering players a deeply emotional and immersive experience. In this essay, we will explore the various elements that contribute to the brilliance of God of War, from its captivating narrative and character development to its breathtaking visuals and innovative gameplay mechanics.

Compelling Narrative and Character Development:

At the heart of God of War's success lies its compelling narrative, a departure from the Greek mythology that characterized previous installments. The game introduces players to a more mature and contemplative Kratos, the Spartan warrior, who now finds himself in the rich tapestry of Norse mythology. The decision to explore a new pantheon allows for a fresh narrative perspective, making the story accessible to both long-time fans and newcomers alike.

The central theme of the game revolves around Kratos' relationship with his son, Atreus. The emotional depth and complexity of their bond elevate the narrative beyond the typical action-adventure fare. Kratos, once a vengeful god, is now a father trying to navigate the challenges of parenthood while grappling with his violent past. The growth and development of these characters throughout the journey lend a poignant and relatable dimension to the narrative, resonating with players on a profound level.

The storytelling is masterfully woven into the gameplay, with seamless transitions between cinematic cutscenes and player-controlled sequences. The emotional weight of the narrative is further amplified by the stellar performances of the voice cast, particularly Christopher Judge as Kratos and Sunny Suljic as Atreus. The result is a narrative experience that transcends the boundaries of conventional gaming, evoking emotions and investment rarely seen in the medium.

Breathtaking Visuals and Artistic Design:

God of War sets a new standard for visual excellence in gaming. The game's graphics, powered by the stunning capabilities of the PlayStation 4 hardware, deliver a visual spectacle that is nothing short of breathtaking. The attention to detail in character models, environments, and atmospheric effects is a testament to the dedication of the development team.

The world of Midgard, inspired by Norse mythology, is rendered with meticulous care. From the towering peaks of the Nine Realms to the serene beauty of the Lake of Nine, each locale is a visual feast that immerses players in a mythical realm. The dynamic camera, which maintains a single shot throughout the entire game, enhances the cinematic quality of the experience, allowing players to appreciate the intricacies of the world without interruption.

The artistic design extends beyond the visual to the auditory, with a hauntingly beautiful score composed by Bear McCreary. The music complements the tone and setting of the game, heightening emotional moments and adding a layer of depth to the overall experience. The marriage of visual and auditory elements in God of War creates an immersive world that captivates players from the moment they embark on Kratos and Atreus' journey.

Innovative Gameplay Mechanics:

God of War not only excels in narrative and visuals but also introduces innovative gameplay mechanics that redefine the action-adventure genre. The combat system undergoes a significant overhaul, shifting from the fixed, cinematic camera angles of previous entries to an over-the-shoulder perspective. This change brings a newfound intimacy to the combat, allowing players to feel the weight and impact of each strike.

The Leviathan Axe, Kratos' primary weapon in this installment, introduces a satisfying and versatile combat experience. Players can throw the axe at enemies, recalling it to their hand with a satisfying thud, or engage in close-quarters combat with a combination of light and heavy attacks. The seamless integration of Atreus into the combat adds an additional layer of strategy, as players can command him to shoot arrows, providing crowd control and opening up new tactical possibilities.

The game's progression system is well-balanced, offering a variety of upgrades for both Kratos and Atreus. From new combat skills and magic abilities to weapon enhancements, the progression system encourages players to experiment with different playstyles while maintaining a sense of character growth and empowerment.

Open-World Exploration and Side Quests:

God of War introduces a more expansive and interconnected world compared to its linear predecessors. The Lake of Nine serves as a central hub, connecting various realms and offering opportunities for exploration. The decision to adopt an open-world structure enhances the sense of adventure, as players can undertake side quests, discover hidden secrets, and encounter optional bosses while progressing through the main story.

The side quests, often interwoven with Norse mythology and lore, contribute to the richness of the game world. These quests are not mere diversions but provide additional context to the narrative, fleshing out the world and its inhabitants. The open-world design encourages players to engage with the game beyond its main storyline, fostering a sense of discovery and curiosity.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, God of War stands as a pinnacle of modern gaming, seamlessly blending a compelling narrative, breathtaking visuals, innovative gameplay mechanics, and an expansive world. The evolution of Kratos as a character, the emotional depth of the narrative, and the exploration of Norse mythology contribute to a gaming experience that transcends its genre. Santa Monica Studio's meticulous attention to detail and commitment to excellence have resulted in a masterpiece that not only satisfies long-time fans of the series but also sets a new standard for the potential of storytelling in video games. God of War is not merely a game; it is an immersive journey that leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of those who experience its brilliance.

The story isnt the problem. Its quite good. Engaging and the side quests really help expand it. You want to explore to hear more LORE. However I refuse to compliment any writing team. 99% of the game is just borrowing already existing lore and stories.

RPG mechanics/geat progression and the god forsaken BOAT really ruin pacing of the game. Enemies having levels makes for artificial difficulty spikes in extremely unfun ways and leads to alot of uncreative encounters. The game WANTS you to explore but you get punished for it. Punished by having to slowly row around in that fucking boat. Punished by fighting enemies 3-4 levels higher then you randomly (which instant kill you of course). Punished later when you go back to story content and nothing is a threat.

Id rate it a 7.5/10. Its not a 7 and it sure aint an 8. Definetly not worth full price either. Bought on sale for $25 and id say if it drops to about $30 its a fair price. Long as you're the kinda person to actively explore content.

You play as Kratos, this super tough warrior dude with a cool axe, who's on an adventure with his son, Atreus. The best thing about this game? The battles are insanely cool! Kratos fights giant creatures and gods using his axe and bare hands, and it's all so intense and action-packed.

But wait, the coolest part? The story! It's like a movie you play. Kratos and Atreus travel through this amazing world based on Norse mythology, meeting all sorts of crazy characters and facing mind-blowing challenges. And their relationship throughout the game is so touching and well-done, you'll totally feel connected to them.

The graphics and world in ""God of War"" are out of this world! Seriously, it's like you're in a painting. The forests, the mountains, even the monsters look insanely real! And the way the game's camera follows you everywhere, giving you this cinematic experience? It's genius!

The game's puzzles and exploration are super fun too. You get to solve puzzles that really make you think, and the whole world is filled with secrets and treasures waiting for you to discover.

In a nutshell, ""God of War"" 2018 is a masterpiece! It's got jaw-dropping fights, an emotional story, stunning graphics, brain-teasing puzzles, and a world you'll want to explore forever. If you're into action-packed adventures with a touch of emotion and mind-blowing visuals, this game is an absolute MUST-play!

- The controls are great. 
- The menus are clean. 
- Video Sequences are very nice and can be paused. 
- Graphics are fantastic after tweaking settings. *After turning off AMD FSR 2.0 all looked great for my system. I also used 
 G-sync and mostly Ultra settings with Shadows and reflections on high. 
- Navigation is great for most of the game. 
- The story is very good.  
- Difficulty settings can be changed. 
- Touch of humor at times. 
- Boss fights are split into stages allowing you to save and continue if you die. 
- The game often gives you tips or warnings if it senses you are lost.  
- Great ending.  

 

Negative: 
- No audio narration in the codex journal. 
- Some of the combat sequences felt over the top for my liking. *Think Matrix.  
- Limitations where you can walk or jump. 
- Keeping up with button combinations for attack upgrades is a bit frustrating. 
- You can’t swing your axe when holding the shield.  
- Parts of the game make you play through certain areas again which is a little repetitive.  

 
Conclusion: 

During the first quarter of the game all I could think was “Why would anyone want to play anything else?”, it just felt that good. 

The high imagination level is well appreciated, leaving a lot of memorable areas and scenes. There are vivid colors, organic elements and clever mechanical puzzles. 

The only real drawbacks for me were somewhat minor. There was some repetitiveness about halfway through which left me a little frustrated. Otherwise, no real complaints. 

Compared to Skyrim, it’s nowhere near as dark. Instead, it provides more life, vibrancy and some human emotion.  

I am very pleased with God of War. The dynamic between father and son felt natural and believable. This combined with a likable story helped carve out one heck of an experience.

10/10

This game is seriously a home run. Watching Kratos develop from this extremely gruff character that has seen (and caused) immense tragedy to developing into a father who, although still rough, actually shows a tender side is great character development. Its crazy to me that after years of fighting in the Greek pantheon they were able to make such a smooth transition to an entirely new area with a new feel while also still keeping many of the things that we loved about the original series. The story is amazing, graphics look great, game play is smooth, and I never felt bored. A true masterclass from Sony, well done.",1703653128,1703653128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is kind of annoying sometimes, especially while playing on the hardest difficulty. Each enemy requires a certain strategy for defeating them however, more often than not, you'll have to constantly fight more than one type of enemy. Each one requiring a different strategy than the other. While you're focusing on an Ogre, for example, 7 Reavers just destroy you in 1 hit.

Gameplay-wise the game is great, I enjoyed the quasi open world, the fighting system and the RPG-elements, so if you are mostly interested in gameplay, the game won't disappoint, but if you have a great expectation from the story and from the father-son relationships this game will probably greatly disappoint you, like it did for me.

They changed the whole camera angle to give the game a cinematic feeling, and if one's is playing the game by paying attention to the story, one will be greatly let down. So many plot holes and inconsistencies. For example, it feels like Atreus is not a product of love but a mistake of a broken condom. How the fück did Kratos started a family but has zero familial bond with his son? What was he doing for 8 years, was he an absent father? It certainly feels like it. The family dynamics are very weird, and they are not explained at all. I don't understand who can play this game and enjoy the father-son's relationship.  His son literally raised his hand at his father at one point, what is completely unconscionable for anyone from a decent family. The relationship feels more like a story about trashy drunken low-class people rather than a story about gods and mythical beings, there is nothing epic about all characters in the story. If the original series had that Greek tragedy and mythology vibe to it, here we have a story about trashy scumbags with superpowers. Something like [i]The Boys[/i].

A playstation game full of a lot of ""Cinematic"" slop (because games are desperate to be movies now), but the gameplay designers mostly saved the game from being complete garbage. There are a few issues with gameplay like lack of enemy variety, bad arena designs along with the camera etc. On a first time playthrough some of the slower parts aren't as bad if you care about the story, but the ""platforming"" and world exploration could have been done in a less time wasting way, and they should have had more combat and less pretty environment sections. Combat is easy to learn hard to master and there's a lot of extra content in Niflheim / Musphelheim if you really want along with Valkeyrie fights. Combat is good 

What are some good things about this game? 
-The combat is MOSTLY fun and you can do very little or a lot with it depending on your skill / familiarity with the game 
-The story is good for the most part and kept me engaged 
-Graphics are fine 
-There's a lot of extra optional content for people who aren't normies playing this on ""Give me a story :nerdemoji:"" difficulty, yes that's the name for easy 
	-Valkeyrie fights are challenging (rage inducing) but also fun to finally beat 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are some bad things? 

-MUSPHELHEIM AND NIFLHEIM ARE FUCKING ABSOLUTE trash. They're just annoying slogs to play. Musphelheims challenges are fucking painful to finally do and niflheim just throws a shitton of annoying enemies at you while you walk around collecting shit. I might enjoy niflheim more now that I'm better at combat, but probably not. 

-The intro is painfully slow 
-There's a lot of cinematic trash like :
	-Slow AUTO CLIMBING THAT TAKES ZERO skill and is literally only there to waste your time 
	-Slow boat rowing to get to scattered little islands 
	-You can't jump and jumping ""puzzles"" you just spam jump until Kratos auto jumps for you 
	-THE CAMERA STYLE IS FUCKING TRASH and does not fit the gameplay. Another one of the decisions that Corey Barlog made that I completley disagree with. 
	
-The open world is empty and pretty scaled back from other open world games, there's not a whole lot for you to do in the open world 

-The game should have been quicker. What I mean by quicker is that movement should have been faster, the climbing sections should not even exist. There should have been more combat between spaces. The game is too slow for being a god of war game
	
-There is not enough combat during the main story and in the open world environments, it almost feels like you're walking around oepning chests 80% of the time and then 		you get to fight the other 20%, maybe less

	
-The ENEMY VARIETY is absolute fucking trash. Not only that, but some of these enemies are just painfully annoying to fight. There is a whole type of enemy that you 	literally cannot melee fight. You HAVE to throw your axe at it  and slowly very slowly chip away at it's heatlh while also making sure some other crackhead zombie 	doensn't fist you from behind while you're not paying attention. 
	(I wasn't even aware of this enemy behavior until I looked at the codex finally)

			-To explain this point further: There are like 7 different enemies with COMPLETELY different behavior that look nearly identical. (The draugr) This is 				fucking abyssmal game design and it lead to so much confusion when I was first playing the game. 
			
			-Barely any actual boss fights, they reuse the troll enemy multiple times in place of real bosses. I don't care that they ""ran out of time"" the game 				still suffers. They should have delayed the game. And no, I don't buy the idea that a boss takes a year and a half to make I don't know why I 				keep hearing that from game directors. 

-The game has very weird pacing. You go from beating encounters easily during the main story to having weirdly difficult fights that are just artificially difficult because there's like 5 enemies throwing projectiles at you one after the other at different times 

-The RPG mechanics are fucking annoying. (Which is why I decided on this latest playthrough to just download someones new game plus save, I do not want to have to worry about grinding for mats to upgrade shit, I wanted to focus on getting better at combat) This one confuses me, becuase I like loot games like diablo, and I always say they should combine looting mechanics with skill based mechanics, but it really doesn't work. At least not here. I do not want to have to go around loot hunting and loot farming to level up my armor just so that I can survive some damage. In a game like this, the focus should be on improving at the combat and mastering it, not worrying about if you need to have more vitality enchantments. I don't even know why it's here honestly. The old games were hack and slash, not looting action rpg's. If they want stuff to find in chests / in the open world and from bosses, make stuff cosmetic. There's also already the runic attacks that you can find, and health / rage upgrades.\

-I honestly don't think they did Kratos enough justice in the game. He's very quiet most of the time even when he's angry. There's not very many badass moments with him, it just feels like they missed out on some fan service in the game. The intro / outro fights do a good job of making him feel badass, (mainly the intro fight) I just wish we could have seen more of that. 

-I'm tired of projectile enemies that spawn with no indiciation in a far corner of the arena that I can't even SEE BECUASE OF THE CINEMATIC CAMERA, that throw shit at you while you're distracted with enemies you can actually hit. I do not care if you're trying to incentivize me to throw the axe, fuck off. They take like 5 - 7 axe throws to kill on higher difficulties and it's UNFUN. If you want something designed to make me throw the axe, make it a UNIQUE ENEMY THAT DOESN'T LOOK THE SAME AS THE OTHERS and isn't a fucking sponge. Also, next time make the axe throw attack options not weak as fuck. One of them makes you hold the aim key while it SLOWLY has dots appear signifying how many times it will hit. It feels sluggish and slow and I feel like it's too dangerous to use. The risk outweighs the reward massively, because it hardly does any damage. Perhaps it does decent stun damage or something? maybe it's useful if all of the enemies in the room are far away, but the point still stands. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------
Final thoughts: 
If you're going to play this and want to enjoy your time with it get a notebook / piece of paper and write down things like the button combos as you unlock them so that you have smoething to reference quickly without having to read through the attacks individually in the menu. Otherwise you'll probably forget most of them even exist, at least I did. Also, when you come across a new enemy, try to read the codex to see what bullshit you have to deal with, it will make your life so much easier and less frustrating. Try not to chuck your controller at the wall when a draugr comes up to you and you try to hit it multiple times only to do no damage to it and have half your hp gone in 5 seconds. If there is some stupid bastard on a platform throwing projectiles at you, do your best to prioritize the fucker and spam arrows / throw your axe at it while trying to avoid other enemies. Yes this review is mostly negative, because I have a lot of complaints about this game and it doesn't get enough criticism from people soyjacking over it becuase ""omg it's so mature and cinematic""

Haven't tried it out but for people like me who have bought it recently too and having problems like I'm having that if you just go to the games .exe change the name from ""GoW.exe"" to ""GoW_.exe"" from what I have been told by a few it fixes the problem I think, haven't tried it out yet but yeah this game shouldn't be verified because of this, infact that's a lie.",1703486934,1703487345,False,1,0,0.487218797206878662,2,True,False,False

Developed by Santa Monica Studio, this game is a testament to exceptional storytelling, immersive gameplay, and breathtaking visuals.

At its core, ""God of War"" is a narrative-driven journey that follows the gripping tale of Kratos, a tormented and complex character, as he navigates through the realms of Norse mythology alongside his son, Atreus. The game showcases a remarkable evolution of Kratos, transforming him from a vengeful god into a father figure striving to impart wisdom while dealing with his haunted past.

One of the game's most remarkable features is its seamless integration of storytelling and gameplay. The single-shot camera technique immerses players in a cinematic experience, creating an uninterrupted flow that enhances the emotional depth of the narrative. The bond between Kratos and Atreus is beautifully portrayed, fostering not only a compelling dynamic between the characters but also influencing gameplay mechanics and puzzle-solving elements.

The combat system in ""God of War"" is both brutal and sophisticated. It combines visceral melee combat with RPG elements, offering a diverse range of weapons, skills, and abilities that players can upgrade throughout their journey. Each encounter feels intense and rewarding, encouraging strategic thinking and mastery of combat techniques as players face challenging foes and colossal boss battles.

Furthermore, the game's attention to detail is nothing short of breathtaking. From the stunning landscapes of the Nine Realms to the intricately designed creatures and mythological beings, every aspect of the game is meticulously crafted, showcasing the developers' dedication to delivering a visually stunning and immersive world.

Beyond its technical achievements, ""God of War"" succeeds in evoking genuine emotions. It's not just a tale of epic battles but a profound exploration of themes like parenthood, sacrifice, and redemption. The emotional depth of the characters and their interactions creates a bond between players and the game world that lingers long after the credits roll.

In conclusion, ""God of War"" isn't just a game; it's a masterpiece that sets a new standard for storytelling, gameplay mechanics, and visual artistry in the gaming industry. It's a testament to the power of video games as an art form, leaving an indelible mark on anyone fortunate enough to experience its awe-inspiring journey.",1703438530,1703438530,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It feels really inconsistent whether you stagger an enemy with your hits or not. Sometimes, one hit from the blades of chaos is all it takes to stagger a large enemy, other times I hit them with an entire heavy runic attack and they don't flinch. Some monsters are slow, like draugr and hel-walkers or whatever else. Then there's the bullshit enemies.

-Revenants
They constantly teleport around, and usually end their stagger or stun by immediately teleporting away. You can't hit them at first, so you have to command Atreus to shoot them. After that, they are suddenly corporeal and you can hit them for a little while. They have very hard to see projectiles on the ground, and an acid vomit attack that has very little windup. For some reason, they also have a melee hit with their staff that is really quick. It sounds really manageable when there's just one, and it is. When there are multiple? The game has told you to go fuck yourself. At that point, all you can do is hide behind your shield in the corner and throw your axe at them repeatedly. It's not safe to go after one with melee, because you're gonna get hit by one of the others because you're not looking at it. I'm writing this review because I got 4 high level revenants in one room in Ivaldi's workshop, which has a time limit that kills you. You can't afford to play it slow and safe, yet the game keeps spawning enemies that force me to do exactly that. No guides on the internet gave me any conclusive strategy besides ""hide behind your shield and throw your axe.""

-Wulvers
Werewolves on crack. They have no fucking telegraphs. They're manageable usually, but there's a beefier version that goes into a frenzy mode where nothing can stop it and the bastard flies around like superman with unblockable attacks.

These little reptilian shitheads like to burrow into the ground and lunge at you with a yellow-circle attack. It's hard enough to deal with a group of *just* tatzelwurms, but throw other enemies into the mix and it's like pushing water uphill. There's also a poisonous variant that is somehow able to hit you for over half your health while staggered from your melee attacks. I don't see this mentioned anywhere and I don't know how to avoid it besides avoiding melee combat entirely.

-The fucking trolls
These ones aren't even hard. They're just, and I can't stress this enough, *FUCKING EVERYWHERE.* Over 75% of this game's boss fights are just recolored trolls. They fixed this in ragnarok, but this isn't a review of that game. This game's boss fights cycle between trolls and ancients, and both of them are really uninteresting. Aside from a few exceptions, of course. And those exceptions were really cool.

-Ancients
Do you like unblockable attacks? Do you like undodgeable attacks? Do you like both at the same time that requires you to hide behind map geometry? Great! Now have the same telegraph for each one of those so the player has to cower behind map geometry the whole fight anyway. And you can't even fight them normally. Outside of spartan rage, the only way to damage these fucks is to throw your axe into their mouth and throw their own shit at them. Really boring and ruins the flow of the combat. Oh, and sometimes there are other enemies to deal with too. Have fun dying because some fuckboy of a draugr came up behind you and gently tapped you, stunning you long enough to get roasted by the ancient's beam.


This game's combat just feels like they designed everything independently and threw them in groups anyway. For how nice this game is to look at and how incredibly well done the characters and story is, I just can't stand the combat. I just wish these things were explained a bit better in a lot of parts, if they have an explanation at all. The ""codex"" is just Atreus yapping about their lore + one or two obvious things about them.

On low difficulties this game is entirely too easy, on hard difficulties this game is remarkably unfair. There isn't really a sweet spot unless you intentionally neuter your own strength by bringing crappy armor.",1703371918,1703371918,False,0,0,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False

The immediate pop up of a ""playstation survey"" was already kinda hillarious but a graphical bug that appeared shortly into the game just made it unplayable. When moving and turning a grey mess of flickering pixels appears around kratos character which is really hurtful to look at. Changing graphics around in pretty much whatever way didnt fix it. As im running hundreds of other games perfectly on my machine i can only blame a lackluster console port here. 

I wanna mention that the graphics in general, even on the highest possible settings, are absolutely outdated and ugly. It looks like a playstation 2 game in some moments.

Its definitely not worth the money and if youre interested in this game you should aim for playing it on console for sure.

Also, bluetooth simply does not work regardless. I still do not recommend, original review is below.

I played and finished this game on PS5 and it was amazing, however the PC port has janky controller support for their own controllers. Dualsense through bluetooth just does not work, and when plugged in it works for movement but in menus the slightest tap of the button makes it scroll through the menus uncontrollably fast.

Somehow, a game about the God of War who's essentially a mass murderer is... heartwarming? I judge story games by how they make me feel while playing them, and God of War is excellent at emotional play. Sometimes you wanna just take a break because of how depressing it is, and other times you can't stop playing because of how fun and exciting it is. The story is riveting, the characters are surprisingly fun, and the world building is fantastic. The soundtrack is also a highlight.

Stories that are character driven are the best stories, period, and the characters all have emotional depth and great story arcs. Even the characters mentioned only once or twice have stories that you experience in subtle ways.

In terms of gameplay, God of War is super fun! The combat is obviously the highlight, but the world exploration is also really well done. Finding/earning cool new gear, weapons, and enchantments is extremely fun as well. Oh, and I can't forget the side stories, they are super entertaining.

I loved this game. So much so in fact that upon upon completion of the main story I instantly started a New Game + (which, btw, adds tons of cool new gear exclusive to NG+) and 100% completed the game (yes, even taking out every single one of Odin's ravens).

I must say, this is definitely one of the best story games of the past decade, so it's no surprise it's gotten international attention.

Overall, a 9.25/10, would highly recommend.

TL;DR - the highlights of God of War are the combat and the story, but the world exploration, soundtrack, and characters are all fantastic as well. Play this if you're looking for an entertaining yet gritty story with excellent combat mechanics.",1703294784,1703294784,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The visuals are stunning, the npc character design is so cool and interesting, the depiction of north mythos is breathtaking.
But the actual gameplay consists of mashing buttons and solving mindless repetitive puzzles and walking along a predetermined paths, the side-content is horrendous and rewards nothing but xp and steel which you will be flooded with anyway.
Upgrades do little to change the gameplay loop, unlocking a new attack means nothing when all you do is still click until enemies die.
Gear upgrades are pointless stat boosts and for some reason they insisted on going with a artifact-system to engrave your gear, which does nothing but further slightly boost said pointless stats and overcomlicate things.

Enemy-variety is already low and made even more pointless by the fact that what you do to beat any of them is still just mash buttons, and when the game actually introduces new mechanics to ""make it harder"" then its one of 3 things...
1. the enemy has a shield and you know need to bash him before you can button mash, which is just another nuisance and does nothing to make the game more interesting og change the way you engage with enemies.
2. the enemy is flying... and now you have to rely on the horrible hit registration of your weapon throws, or wait for BOY to have arrows ready.
3. its a hag and hags are literally the worst part of this game as they can only be damaged after being hit with arrows and this mechanic is so annoying that i would rather deal with hemmoroids.

Combat lacks any kind of soul or real difficulty and changing the difficulty only increases the damage you take and more importantly reduces the damage you deal.
I ended up going with the easiest difficulty simply because i got so tired of bulletsponges and more importantly to avoid grinding pisspoor sidecontent for stat upgrades.
The way you engage with enemies is always just clicking until something dies.
the only two weapons you have are the axe and chaos blades and although their attacks are slightly different both weaposn functionally just require you to click until shit dies.
In the few circumstances it was possible ij just ran across enemies, i wish there was simply a skip button for the combat sections.

Puzzles are designed to be solvable by fucking toddlers and engaging with them feels intellectually insulting, i have nothing more to add.
The game is the most standard triple-a semi-open world gooffest you could imagine.

This is not a game with cutscenes, it is cutscenes with gameplay inbetween to extend playtime.
And unless you really insist on having an anurism i would highly reccomend just watching the cutscenes on youtube, the 50 dollars i spent on this nonsense was not even close to worth it and i didnt even bother with finnishing the game because i simply got so sick of it and instead watched the last parts of the story on online.",1703154395,1703154395,False,4,0,0.436382293701171875,0,True,False,False

Personally, I find the story and ost to be pretty much the parts of the game that I hold no real animosity towards as they serve their purpose superbly and interconnect well with each other. While I do like the story and ost, it really is everything else about this game that I actively dislike. 

Perhaps the problem I have the most issue with is in regards to the gameplay, which I am not really a fan of how the designers went about certain aspects of it. Consider the following, the difficulty setting, before complaints come about about Git Gud are thrown around I believe I should explain myself and my issue with its implementation. I played the game in the hardest available difficulty available to non newgame+ players and my experience with it does not make me excited over the prospect of a higher difficulty because ultimately the way it is achieved leaves a lot to be desired. 

There are two main issues I see with it, first of all, the enemies are given more health and damage, and while one can argue this is how most games handle difficultly there is an inclusion to this that makes the gameplay so much more irritating. As it wouldn't be a real issue if the core mechanics of combat are consistent, however, due to the higher damage/level output of the enemy, they can actually break through your attempts to parry or block with your shield. So effectively you cannot block attacks as getting hit once is Game Over, thus a core aspect of the combat is literally useless to you and that makes the fights so much more boring and slower as instead of beating your opponent through timing your parries or blocking hits, you have to dodge each and every time and slowly whittle down their health... the worst part is that I am not even describing a boss in this scenario, this is literally the first big enemy you face in the overworld and you can consider every one of these opponents that you face in your journey on the same level. 

That being said, the difficulty does eventually ease... when you finally are able to level up through equipment. This in turn means that the difficulty is mainly centralized on the beginning of the game where you are still learning the ropes of the game and remember what I said about blocking and parrying. Due to how the difficulty is balanced, you don't really start to be able to properly time parries till mid-game. God of War is not a difficult game, it is an unfair game at the beginning and only mildly becomes difficult when it comes to fighting the Valkyries several times. While one can argue that I simply needed to lower the difficulty, I would, in turn, argue that nameless mob enemies didn't need their every hit to be unblockable OHKO's and the gameplay outside of parrying actually fun and engaging.

I should also mention how I hate how the level up system is based on the equipment you wear rather than any actual experience but honestly that is a minor gripe all things considered. The only thing it actually affect is how bad the early game if you are playing at a higher difficulty as I said, as well as maybe those privy towards a certain aesthetic choice in attire and want to play a game wearing certain drip. While I understand that concern, as I have said, it is a minor one. 

While not the most original criticism I do feel it is one that is necessary to point out, the overall lack of enemy diversity. This is a similar problem to what I find in Breath of the Wild, as while in a technical sense I guess one can argue that both games have quite the assortment of enemies to fight, due to how the world is designed there is no specialization in the unique locations so you generally fight the same enemies across all the different realms with the only real distinguishing feature being a color palette swap in the most generous of cases. There is one exception, however, but that one exception is a really bad example as in Alfhiem, the main assortment of enemies you usually fight are replaced with.... 1 enemy type that you fight for most of the region. Eventually another variant does get added but its far too late in the experience to matter and even then, those variants still have mostly the same attack patterns. So we left with a general sense of sameness across all the locations in terms of enemy variety.

This problem in turn starts to affect the bosses as for the most part, the majority of bosses in this game are simply beefed up enemies that you can fight in the world while exploring. Not only that but some of the bosses that you do not face while exploring are repeatable, I am, of course, talking about the Valkyries as while I do admit they are fun to fight against... the first time, you can choose to fight multiple variants of these bosses should you explore and find them. There are minor differences in their movesets but the point is you still have to fight several of them and those minor differences in movesets do not adequately justify the amount of times you do.
 
While a lot of the enemies are indeed rehashes, there is still also the issue with the bosses that are unique as they are for the most a major departure of the previous GOW titles in terms of boss design. For reference, I personally like the Boss fights against Hermes and Cronos in GOW 3, because functionally they play out more like a stage than an actual fight, you have to reach a certain point in the level and complete a couple of objectives to defeat the boss so to speak. They work almost like puzzles and this was a large part of the appeal in those games, the puzzle and the scale of enemies. Sadly, I feel this was mostly lost in the new games. For example, the only real big enemy that you fight in the game would be the Dragon. In previous games, you would've certainly been fighting on its back while it was moving and using those lightning crystals to start blowing apart each limb individually until the climactic finish, which I will admit the finisher in this game was rather old GOW in its brutality, but the point remains that the fight played out very differently. Instead you are on a circular arena and hitting the limbs of the dragon while it is just standing there for the most part. It is not cinematic and doesn't reach anywhere close to the scale as the previous games. Despite that, I would say that was the highlight of the game in terms of bosses as the other fights are either buffed enemies or humanoid ones such as Baldor or Magni and Modi. Baldor, while a great villain, I wish the final fight itself took even more lessons from the final Zeus fight. [spoiler] Such the Stone Giant actually being part of the fight instead of just a background detail like how you actually had to destroy Gaia 's heart while fighting Zeus as well as using her to heal. [/spoiler] So while the boss fights are fun, most are repetitive and the actual good ones don't quite have the same scale as the old games, which I think is a travesty.
 
While I do ultimately recommend this game, I do so reluctantly as I have already noted in explicit detail, there is a lot of things that I actually dislike about this game and not a lot that I view positively. This is also included in the fact that I do not like the direction the sequel took the series due to it not really solving the majority of the issues I had with game and in some cases only serve to exasperate some of the deeper flaws as well as just poor design choices overall but enough about the sequel. The point is this game is a relatively mixed bag for me and the more I think about it, the less positive of an impression I am left with, however, even after all these years I am still left recommending this game mostly do to its coherent narrative and story about a father teaching his BOY about being a moral and upstanding person.",1703141712,1703141834,True,0,0,0.470085442066192627,0,True,False,False

+ It`s emersive and the story is catching. The progression system  and looting is rewarding and satisfying.
+ Big world, there are a lot of riddles, bosses, god knows cutscenes and for thoose of you who are interested in hunting them, achievements.
+ The game makes you think and the combat is challenging. If you change your abbilities etc. it`ll take a long time before it gets boring
- on rare occasions you can get stun-chained by enemy groups which can be frustrating 
( i guess i suck )
+ / - its a realy beautiful game but it brought my 1400 euro PC on high settings to its limmits, and if you dont have enough d-vram the game will crash.
All in all it`s a banger game, i shredded threw the main story in like a week, really the game is addicting.
I`ll probably take another 10-15h to do everything there is to do before i wait and pray for the pc version of ragnarök. Buy it.",1703029356,1703029562,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What I will tell you is a few flaws that by no means put this below a great experience. 

The skill tree is fine, but the equipment, crafting and levelling system all seems like it's tacked on because they wanted an open world game and needed to put something in it aside from the story. 

Lastly, the combat is fine but not special. This would be fine except most of the gameplay is combat. This came to a head during the valkyrie fight in muspelheim where on top of a lot of valkyrie attacks being very fast/wide requiring perfect dodging and timing, there is an unblockable AOE attack that you can use the quick turn (apparently) to negate the damage if you don't face the attack. This is a) the first time I've actually used this mechanic throughout my 25 hour playthrough and b) not consistent. 

Great game but let down by metroidvania style post game.  8/10

[b] Overall [/b] : 9/10

God of War is a MUST HAVE for any fan of action adventure game. An epic story, beautiful graphics, great gameplay, great soundtrack, all the ingredients for one of the best game on PC and a really nice port from Playstation!.

[b] Gameplay [/b] : 9/10

The game combines exploration phase and combat phase. You have basically an semi-open world setting, as the map is divided into zones that you can explore, but within those zones, it's mostly corridor base. The exploration will allow you to find artifacts, weapons and armors that will help you grow in your journey. The combat phase is great and very dynamic. Lots of possible combos, with 2 different weapons. 

[b] Graphics [/b] : 10/10

Just magnificent. If you cam experience it in 4K HDR, that will blow your eyes. Sharp textures, great FX, beautiful lightings.

[b] Story [/b] : 9/10

If you know the God of War trilogy, this one basically follows the same character but in a different setting and much later after the events of the first 3. Having playing the trilogy helps but is definetely not a requirement.
The story is rather long and will take you across various realms. Great characters will unfold and I found the pacing very good.

[b] Achievements [/b] : 5/10

For the hunters out there, the game requires a bit of grind, and now comes THE advice. DO NOT play for your 100% attempt, on Give me God Of War difficulty (the highest). That was my mistake and it was very painful. As there is no difficulty achievement, and the highest tier is extremely punishing. You have been warmed. Otherwise, quite straightforward, but 2 achievements essentially will be annoying, requiring quite a grind to get them. Overall, it was a fun 100% thanks to the game quality.",1702915536,1702915536,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,1,True,False,False

And when it finally made its debut on steam I knew I had to get it. This game is a great game, although ive noticed its age and how it falls short. Firstly, this game has an incredible story, although the plot is very simple, the characters are three dimensional and complex. Every character feels real and grounded, which helps the player connect with and understand the intricacies of each properly. The story is easily this game's best feature. Secondly, the combat and progression in this game feels great. I loved the weight of my attacks and the satisfaction of upgrading my equipment and abilities. I played through on the second hardest difficulty, and I am looking to play again on the hardest. The gameplay is a definite win from me, even if it copied fromsoft's homework it still remains fun. Lastly, unfortunately I noticed some lagspikes and frame drops on my computer whilst playing even at the lowest settings. This type of performance is not normal for a computer such as mine, which while not top of the line still holds its own in titles such as cyberpunk and elden ring or starfield. Even so, I found the graphics to not be as I remember them on release years ago, textures were blurry even on high settings and grass and hair particularly ruined the illusion. But I digress, the game is not brand new and still manages to be beautiful as a whole.

After Horizon Zero Dawn released a while back I was optimistic that this game would release. Lo and behold, the bastards did it. And not only is this a great entry from one of my all-time favorite Playstation franchises, it's a damn well-optimized port as well-- with ultra-wide support, DLSS, and all the bells and whistles a good PC game would usually ship with.

As for the game itself, it's pretty fantastic. The combat is weighty and chock-full of impact. Every swing you land with the Leviathan axe has a palpable meatiness to it. Plus throwing the axe and having it come back to you in time for you to continue chopping away at foes just feels incredible.

Story-wise the game is also strong. In this entry Kratos fathers another child: a young, naive boy named Atreus, who knows very little of Kratos' cold, harsh temper. While it *is* a reboot in the sense that the franchise is bringing back Kratos and his familiar roots, practically all of the previous entries of the game aren't entirely forgotten-- in fact the consequences of Kratos' actions from those games take a surprisingly large part of the game's narrative here, and it directly affects his relationship with Atreus. I also like how much of these elements are delivered to the player, as it both informs newcomers to the franchise and tosses a bone to longtime fans (like me!)

There are a couple of downsides to this game that I wasn't entirely pleased about. The biggest issue was this game's glaring lack of boss variety. Sure there were some great highlights such as the fight with the Stranger in the beginning of the game, or the huge battle with Hraezlyr in the mountain, but It seems that a notable half of the game's bosses were just the same two-story, pillar-lugging troll that you've definitely seen from the E3 presentation back in 2016.
Additionally I really didn't find myself liking the PC controls as much as I thought I would be with this port. As I struggled to fidget with the controls during the first fight it was really apparent how much this game was designed to be played with controllers in mind. Actions like heavy and light attacks, paired with throwing and recalling the Leviathan axe feels awkward  with a mouse and keyboard. If you're just jumping into this game I definitely recommend that you grab a controller for this one.

Despite all the setbacks, though, I still believe this is a very good game, and definitely something to consider if you're looking for a nice single-player game to kick back to. Sony made a real good decision bringing all of these exclusive titles to PC and I definitely look forward to seeing more titles from them coming to this platform.

And before I give my reasons, one thing has to be made clear: We are at an age where decent (even good) games are being released ALL THE TIME. And games are also getting more and more expensive because of inflation. So the bar for what I can recommend must also be raised if I have to be absolutely honest.

So bearing this in mind, here is why I don't think this game is worth playing.

(1) The story: It's just not enough for a story to be thought as good simply because it resembles a movie. The story here is...just alright? Fine? Good even at places. But what started off super promising ultimately reduces to a series of fetch quests where you're constantly told that you need to get this in order to go there and in order to go there you need to do this favour for that person etc. etc. Granted, big RPGs do this all the time (even the much-revered Witcher 3 does it), but this game relies on this particular trope as a plot device so freaking often that it just gets inane and ridiculous really fast. The story, immersive at first, ultimately reminds you constantly that you are experiencing a ""video game story"" - and no amount of cinematic camerawork can salvage that. What's more, a lot of the character-building is done through dialogue with Atreus while you're roaming the world so if you don't 100% the game you literally don't get a lot of the emotional pay-off and I find this design choice ultimately to the detriment of the story. While the voice actors all did a phenomenal job, I find Atreus' anachronistic mannerisms grating at times as he almost talks like a Tik-tok kid from the 2020s, not exactly appropriate for the time period if I may say so.

(2) The gameplay is clunky: The combat is clearly inspired by the Souls formula except you'll be battling with the camera half the time because they'd rather it be cinematic than actually fun to use. And yes, while you can quick turn-around by clicking on the D-pad it's still annoying when you're fighting high-level enemies and you necessarily have your attention taken away by wrestling with the camera. You can certainly frame it as a skill issue because one can certainly master fighting and fighting with a terrible camera, doesn't mean it's a skill I'd like to - as a gamer - master though. For the hassle it caused me I just don't think mastery of this particular system would quite justify the effort it'd take to ""git gud"". There's also a Shadow of Mordor-esque/Destiny-inspired loot system which I find to be just plain obnoxious. You get 70% of the time useless items but it's all scattered around the map with a Ubisoft-checklist to pad out the game's length and ""encourage exploration"". Granted, there is a lot to see, and the details they put into the world is amazing. I still think the loot system is overwhelming and doesn't contribute to the combat as much as it contributes to the gamer's headache in trying to wrap their head around all the upgrades, runes, charms that you can equip.

(3) Terrible level-designs: Apart from one set-piece that I don't want to spoil mid-game, you mostly just traverse through tight, linear, and narrow corridors populated by generic enemies that you will default back to the same three strategies you use whenever you fight them (offensive, evasive, range-mainly). I think judging from the lukewarm reviews of Ragnarok (this game's sequel I haven't played) people are finally starting to see through the bs of the design philosophy of ""cinematic"" games where loading screens happen alongside boring walking/climbing sections where you push your joystick in one direction and sit back for exposition dumps. The enemy finishers are so few that they get repetitive really fast. The puzzles and the deathtraps also overstate their welcome very quickly. It's like they built these systems for the game and now everything has to revolve around them which means the devs can only be so creative about the types of enemy encounters and puzzle varieties. The world they've built here is not the sort of world that lends itself well to an open-world formula, and while this isn't an open-world game, it does open up gradually as you progress. But unlike Arkham Asylum for instance where you can go anywhere that's unlocked at any time of the story and use your new gadgets to access previously inaccessible areas, GoW (2018) will lock you out of areas because you're at a point in the story where it makes no sense for you to go to those regions. This is so even after unlocking diegetic fast-travel in game! At this point why not design a truly linear, unique experience with variegated levels and enemy encounters, instead of this open-world-Metroidvania-hybrid game where you don't get the joys of exploratory freedom when playing something like The Red Dead Redemption, and yet you don't get the kind of depth to level design like the levels in Dishonored either?

(4) Bizarre and outright bad game design choices: The Valkyries are not hard because they have complicated movesets. They are hard because they are damage sponges and the camera control is so awkward that you have the odds stacked against you by having to deal with the same 2 movesets for 15 minutes while your camera will over time almost certainly screw you over. You don't feel good or a sense of accomplishment by finishing these bosses off, you just get pissed off and frustrated and you try again and again until luck would have it that you beat one of them, and then you realise there're 8 more to fight. The moves that you get from investing in skills also rarely make a difference unless you're intrinsically motivated to vary your combat style just to look cooler while playing. I think it comes down to the laziness of enemy placement where if your gear is good enough you can pretty much spam the same basic combo and get by just fine, without ever having to use any of the new moves you learn. This is such a shame because that means most people will probably not be motivated to use the moves they unlock and they'd end up forgetting about most of them anyway even after finishing the game. This is different from a game like Sekiro where you literally make moves you learn your own by fully grasping what their situational uses are and so it feels much much better when you pull these off. Here you just unlock moves because...you do? And then you proceed to use the same basic-ass combos until you realise you're the source of your own misery (""You're not playing the game cinematically enough"") and YOU are ultimately responsible for changing things up because the game couldn't be bothered to force you to by featuring more creative levels. There's also the (especially towards the end) extremely predictable ""gauntlet of three"" where you get to an area, have your progress artificially impeded by some event while the game throws three waves of enemies at you. Sometimes this gets nested into a broader gauntlet of three where the event will have to play out three times so there will be a total of 9 waves. Riveting level design I know.

I know I could come off as harsh and I realise this is a game beloved by many. And yes the production value is high, the voice-acting is gold standard, and the music and sound design is excellent. Playing the game with a Dual-shock PS5 controller can be quite immersive too. If you played this and loved it there's nothing I've said that you don't already know and disagree with. This review is for people who've played a lot of games, don't really care a lot about graphics/how cinematic a story is so long as it's good, and people who just don't have all the money in the world to buy every game that looks mildly interesting. I think if you're after a story-rich game with fun combat this game is just too mid to get a recommendation:

It's got a story, just not a very rich one; and it's got a serviceable combat, but it's just not very fun to play.",1702654338,1702654450,False,13,3,0.44176676869392395,0,True,False,False

It just makes the fights annoying. The animations and visuals are great, but combat lacks the somewhat tactical feel of earlier GOW games. Definitely too much faffing about with the boy, too much story. Some people love games that are just interactive movies, but I prefer the focus to be on gameplay. Everything in this game feels scripted and stiff. Kratos, who should feel tanky and powerful, is a wimp who can only take 2-3 hits before dying. The early hours of the game are a scripted slog and play control feels like molasses compared to other high-end ARPGs I've played. Environments look great, but are relatively boring linear corridors (with the occasional obligatory boring puzzle / loop-around paths) with little in them that is interactive or destructable.

The game follows Kratos, the iconic Spartan warrior, now navigating the harsh landscapes of Norse mythology with his son, Atreus. The storytelling is masterfully executed, revealing layers of Kratos' character and exploring themes of fatherhood, loss, and redemption. The emotional resonance of the narrative is unparalleled, drawing players into a world where gods, monsters, and mortals collide in a tragic yet beautiful dance.

The visual and artistic prowess of ""God of War"" is nothing short of awe-inspiring. The game's environments are richly detailed, from the towering peaks of Midgard to the dark realms of Helheim. The character designs, especially Kratos and Atreus, are meticulously crafted, conveying a range of emotions that add depth to the storytelling. The use of a single, continuous camera shot throughout much of the game creates a sense of immersion rarely seen in the medium.

The combat system is a symphony of brutality and finesse. Kratos' Leviathan Axe becomes an extension of the player's will, offering a satisfying blend of strategic attacks and visceral executions. The addition of Atreus as a combat ally introduces a layer of strategy, providing ranged support and enabling dynamic combo possibilities. The upgrade system allows for meaningful progression, ensuring that battles remain challenging and rewarding.

Exploration in ""God of War"" is a joy in itself. The world is interconnected, filled with hidden chambers, puzzles, and lore-rich artifacts. Each area tells a story, and the game encourages players to delve into the rich tapestry of Norse mythology through a series of optional quests and collectibles.

The musical score, composed by Bear McCreary, complements the grandeur of the game. From the haunting chants to the powerful orchestral pieces, the soundtrack enhances the emotional impact of key moments, further immersing players in the epic journey.

""God of War"" is not just a game; it's an interactive masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of the medium. Its meticulous attention to detail, gripping narrative, and innovative gameplay make it a benchmark for the potential of storytelling in video games. Even years after its release, ""God of War"" remains a shining example of what can be achieved when creativity, technology, and narrative prowess converge. It's a timeless experience that will be remembered as one of the industry's finest achievements.

It has a beautiful world packed with entertaining characters that you will love. Kratos isn't the same god he was in the original trilogy, and his character change is in line with his shaky but endearing relationship with his son, Atreus.

The world building was excellent, the musical score and the visuals are great considering it is a 5 year old game now. 

A classic tale of a journey that stems from a seemingly simple request that leads into exciting fights with gods and getting murdered by strange creatures you pull out of dimensional holes.

You can't use your attacks, because you never have time to finish the attack animation. Mobs that get hit once will randomly level up and get health back (unless interrupted).

All you get is a vague arrow, pointing that a mob is in that direction. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty, and the mobs have too much health. 1 hit deals 1/20 of 1 mobs health, if they are higher level (+3).

I also have concerns about balancing of the bosses in this game, specifically that in comparison to optional bosses, the story bosses often feel weak, especially in NG+.  Better level scaling or just some balance tweaking on bosses like Baldur and Magni/Modii would make them a lot more engaging.
The combat is really fun but admittedly it's completely different from the originals of the series.  Personally, after playing all but one of the original 7 games, I'm completely fine with a bottom-up rework of the combat.  Everything you can do in this game feels satisfying and the writing is actually solid.  Voice acting is stellar and is deserving of the awards it's gotten / been nominated for.  
I think the developers decided the game either had to reinvent itself or die.  I think it's safe to say they successfully reinvented one of my favorite franchises, somehow, into one of my favorite games I've played.

My main dislike with the game is that at least 5 hours of that is half play/half cutscenes where you have to sit and hold the controller forward and watch your character walk very slowly.  There is very little dialog to keep you interested and they drag on way too long.  Then there are actual cutscenes like riding very slowly in a boat for 20 minutes or watching the characters talk and having to press a button every 5 minutes to keep the scene moving.  Of course there are also cutscenes travelling in elevators that go on for way too long.  These things completely take me out of the game and can be extremely frustrating because the amount of time I have to play is limited.

Update:  Finished the game.  The story was incredibly well written, but the game is just not well designed.  The combat is clunky and over-complicated.  The map is useless for navigation.  The fast travel even forces you to run long distances instead of just taking you from one point to the next.  There are multiple open door/chest mechanics that require you to get a certain item before you can open them, but these chests and doors are in even the very first area forcing backtracking for no real reason.  Of the 9 realms, 4 don't unlock until after you beat the game.  Two of those don't unlock unless you start a new game plus.  There is nothing interesting in them.  Just areas to grind for more armor after you've already finished the game.  A+ for the writers.  F- for the developers.",1702001311,1702309500,False,8,0,0.493677675724029541,0,True,False,False

The combat is a bit slow compared to the past games but its good, the difficulty in this game however is horrible because of the simplistic combat the only difficulty this game has is more enemies and enemies leveling up mid combat in hardest difficulty giving you sense of urgency to finish fights witch is bad in my opinion. The level system as well as armors and items is also bad you can only kill enemies once in this game which means farming for resources to get better gear is impossible, by the time you are able to collect some of the fragments to upgrade your armor you progress to the end of the game and make previous upgrades useless because you can simply craft new armor for less resources and coins.

From one long, continuous shot with no cuts, fades, or wipes to the dynamic of Kratos and Atreus you get fully emotionally invested in the exceptional Storyline and Unique GamePlay. 
When they showed the GamePlay for the first time I was skeptical about it and thought that a story about Father and Son wasn't in GOW style and Oh BOY I was proven so wrong.
The only downside I could see about God Of War 2018 is the lack of boss fights compare to previous games.

As for the gameplay, the story progressed very nicely guiding you through the story in a thoughtful way. When it comes to upgrading or improving skills I wish some of the aspects were explained a little bit more like where I can find items to upgrade or craft improved armor. The combat mechanics were really smooth on deck I would definitely recommend configuring the back paddles to some of your keys or creating some quick attack binds to better the flow of combat.

Dont always go ""straight"" down the path, look around and you'll find a ton of collectibles and points to upgrade your axe and bow.

I recommend upping the fov with Cheat Engine (it's too f*cklng low)

Negatives:
- I'm the God of War and they have me stuck by tiny ledges and stupid mini games. These would be tolerable if they were one-offs but they happen all the fucking time. 
- Scaling ledges, climbing, etc. over and over is tedious and boring. I'm the god of war. Pick up my boy and jump. 
- Enemies are hit sponges. 
- Too much random shit to pick up. Am I saving up for a duvet cover at the market? 
- Dialogue is very inconsistent. One second someone will say something cruel and the next second kind.
- You have to repetitively initiate conversations just to get through all of the disjointed dialogue. 
- Most upgrades are non-engaging and just increases the pre-existing value. Boring.
- You can't skip dialogue or cut scenes.

Positives:

-CAMERA!! oh pls, kill me. all u can see is Kratos' back and bottom covering left half of the screen. it is even worse while fighting, cuz animations cover whole screen and u can't even focus on what enemy is doing: when to dodge/blk, cuz u can't see it properly. additionaly, u have dumb ""incoming attack from behind"" indicators that (for me) SUUUCKS as new vacuum cleener.

- The story was really interesting and engaging 
- They did a great job of character development because the player could feel like they were in kratos shoes. 
- I loved grinding for loot and better weapons as well as figuring out the various puzzle to open chests. 
- The valkyrie was just the right amount of challenge. 

I am excited to see how the story evolves in the next game. I am disspointed that the new game is a ps5 exlusive and will only be released on steam in 2024-2025. I understand that they want to Encourage people to buy the ps5 but in my opinoin pc users shouldn't suffer the consequence because usually people are deciding between xbox sereies x and ps5. Not between pc xbox and ps5, if a users is on pc theyre not going to downgrade to a xbox or a ps5. I also loved the simple mechanics of the game usually fighting games tend  to be really complex with multiple different button combinations for different moves. And while that may be good for the competitive gamers casual gamers tend to what simpler and eaiser to understand controls while still being able to perform well.

Combat starts off fairly simple, but unlocking various abilities (and eventually another weapon) provides a slow approach to advanced combat, which is more than welcome. The Valkyrie fights are a must play, in my humble opinion.  The realms in God of War are diverse, however some are more fleshed out than others. Muspelheim, for example, is boiled down to combat challenges that feel more repetitive than necessary. This realm is optional, however, and allow players to continue unlocking enchantments and armor if they are hungry for more. The world progression involves simple puzzles using the axe that keeps progression simple but makes you think at times. The lore and storytelling is abundant but not overwhelming, consisting of learning lore through shrines and conversations with Mimir. 9/10 from me.

If you enjoyed this game and want to see more from this series, PS5 has every game from GOW, GOW II, GOW III, Ascension, GOW 2018 (probably dont bother buying there if you already have it on steam), and Ragnarok. 
This will kind of be like a split review of both 2018 and Ragnarok since I just beat Ragnarok. Obviously Ragnarok has many mechanics that 2018 does not such as freezing the leviathan axe to do more damage. I won't spoil R's story but I will just say that beating this game is VITAL to fully appreciating the characters and story in Ragnarok.

Going to be bias here seeing as God of War is my favorite single player series and I haven't missed a beat. The game is story rich. The ties back to the previous titles does not overshadow this one. Lore that's worth reading and plays along with the game. I personally liked the combat which is a breath of fresh air for the new format. Performed excellent for me with about 3 things happening through out my 50 hours of game play.

I don't have much on the downsides of the game for me. The blinding white light when getting hit hard, sometimes tedious travel methods, and an uneven amount of enemies ability to run away from you mid fight. Other than that, the game was amazing.

You always feel like you're innovating, adding onto your combat skills way more than some of my other favourite games like the dark souls franchise. It's so beautiful and intricate, the story is very very good and it's worth sinking your time into. Sure, this game has many cutscenes which might bore people at first(can't say i haven't felt the same about it at some points), and sure the game might have its fair share of flaws(sometimes it does suffer from enemy spam, and the balancing is a bit rough sometimes if you go do optional stuff before you finish the game). But this game compels you to do way less exploring before finishing the main content first where its honestly way more balanced than even dark souls 3, which I found adequately balanced throughout. 

One of my only complaints really is that it gives dwarf favours way earlier than you can actually finish them(I was 80% done and the first favour for sindri still had enemies that could one-shot me).

My advice for the difficulty is to pick ""give me a balanced experience"". Every difficulty is, as far as I saw, balanced well. However ""give me a story"" is more balanced as an accessibility difficulty setting with how slowed the enemies are, your vs their damage output and reaction time windows. For the average able-bodied person with time to spare(story is approximately 25-30 hour long) this difficulty setting will get you blazing through the enemies and not really requiring you to learn the combat system anymore than the basics. That's not to say the balanced experience option will teach you to the core how the system works but you will definitely feel badass learning all the combos, moves, advantages and disadvantages of enemies and you will feel satisfied and a powerful menace to the inhabitants of the realms.

It's like dry dung - people suggest you to chew on it a little more to get the taste and it will ""bloom"". But you know it's enough to sniff it a little to understand what's coming.

In a little more detail.
Click enemy to death. Everything is so dragged, long ""realistic"" animations. Terribly cheesy unispiring combat (basic punch, strong punch, block, roll and throw/return axe + Spartan rage). Maybe studio made this in favor of realism, I don't know. If so it was a bad choice.
There's also a horribly boring intro and an autistic son.
No desire to play. Going after a deer with my son - alrighty. But when a tattooed crackhead came to my house asking questions and i had to beat him three times, I dropped the game.
I remembered those dark days of gaming, when the 7th generation consoles (PS3 and X360) came out - a lot of similar cheesy artificially dragged out games came out then. Maybe the plot is somewhat interesting, but the presentation of gameplay and mechanics made in an extremely bad tone (example from the subj: for some reason in the introduction you have to click to cut down a birch tree...), this was infuriating 15 years ago. And now it's completely disgraceful to do so. To be honest, the first half hour of the game can simply be replaced by a cutscene. And teach the mechanics in a slightly more interactive way than it is.
=========================
Если коротко, то пройдите игру на ютубе. Абсолютно переоценена. Как засохшая гавеха - люди предлагают разжевать ее вдумчиво и тогда пойдет вкус и игра раскроется. Но ты знаешь, что такую игру достаточно слегка нюхнуть, чтобы понять, что к чему.

Если чуть поподробнее.
Закликай врага досмерти. Тягомотина. Жутко убогая боевка (основной удар, сильный удар, блок, перекат и кинуть/вернуть топор + спартанская ярость). Может быть в угоду реализма, не знаю. Но зря так.
Еще жутко муторное вступление и сын-аутист.
Из-за всего этого играть нет желания. Поход за оленем с сыном я еще осилил. Но вот когда татуированный зек пришел ко мне домой с какими-то вопросами и пришлось три раза его бить, я закрыл игру.
Вспомнились темные времена гейминга, когда вышли консоли 7 поколения (PS3 и X360), - тогда вышло много подобных убогих игр. Может сюжет там и сколько-то интересный, но подача геймплея и механик сделана в крайне дурном тоне (пример из сабжа: зачем-то во вступлении надо покликать, чтобы срубить березу), который бесил 15 лет назад. А сейчас так делать совсем позорно. Если честно, то первые полчаса игры можно просто заменить катсценой. А обучить механикам чуть более интерактивным путем, чем есть.",1692664140,1700493324,False,1,0,0.400972038507461548,2,True,False,False

Aside from gaming on PC, I have only ever played video games on the Xbox family of consoles. As a result, I never bothered paying attention or getting interested in this franchise as it has  always been a PlayStation exclusive. However, when I found out this game was coming to PC, I made the decision to purchase it and play it due to it being considered one of the best console exclusives of the last generation. 

I was not disappointed. This game is without a doubt one of the best action-adventure games I have ever played. I will spare you the details of describing why this game is good mechanically visually as I cannot do it justice. Rest assured, this game is not buggy, provides enough of a challenge to keep you engaged and entertained, has interesting lore, impeccable dialogue, and is visually pretty. 

But what I find most interesting about this game is the story, Sure, on the surface, it is exciting as it is basically the story of a reformed god of war coming out of retirement for another important mission. And now he has a kid! But deep down, this story is much simpler but more interesting. Looking past the Norse mythology and the established lore of Kratos, this is a story of a father and son who must learn from each other. Kratos, a tough father with a dark past, has to learn how to tell his son about who he is while also protecting him from the world around him. Atreus, a boy who wishes to be accepted by his father but chafes under his domineering nature, must learn about his complicated lineage and reconcile with the fact that his father's strict, authoritarian parenting-style is necessary to prepare him for the world he will inhabit. Together, they learn about one another and from one another in way that is both interesting and entertaining to the player.

Along with stellar gameplay, stunning visuals, and an interesting supporting cast, particularly the exploration of the relationship between an important side character and the main antagonist that provides a nice literary foil, this game is great. I would strongly recommend anybody that likes third-party action adventure to play this game.",1700425991,1700425991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

also boss fights are pitiful except one or two and I didn't see most valkyries. the crafting mechanics are bollocks to me. this is GOW wtf

I did finish the game and even tried my luck with the valkyrie on the labrynth though. I got very confused on how I would upgrade my character and it seems damn deliberate. which pushed me to leave the game without beating a single valkyrie.

the story is great. it really is. this was basically saving grace of this game to me. but on the second game, I will chose to watch it even if I get it free. barely giving this a yes

(SPOILERS AHEAD)
So I slept on this game hard and didn't play it until only a few weeks ago. My reasons for this that I never owned a PS4 and I had heard that this game was essentially an interactive movie so I put it on the backburner until it felt like the right time to play it. I greatly regret not playing this game sooner because holy crap, this game is amazing and I'll explain why.

Story:
So, GoW 4 takes place in a whole new mythology, that being Norse. Kratos made a new family in Midgard after the events of GoW 3 and sought to have a quiet, peaceful life until his wife passed away. Her final wish was to have her ashes spread from the highest point in all of the nine realms. So, Kratos and his son embark on a journey to do just that, but face many trials along the way.

This story is awesome. It shows us a side of Kratos that we really haven't seen before, that being his quiet and compassionate side. He comes to grip with the reality that the new life he had built is crumbling away and he's pretty much powerless. He also is figuring out how to be a better father to Atreus and you can see that he does love his son, but he's terrified to make mistakes so he comes off as cold and distant. This portrayal of Kratos is emotional and realistic, and I love it. This story will make you feel like a badass as well as making you feel like you grew alongside these characters.

Gameplay/Combat:
This combat is just fun as hell. It makes you feel like a complete badass as you get unbelievably strong and take down enemies effortlessly that were previously major trials. It's also reminiscent of FromSoft, but nowhere near as difficult so if you enjoy that kind of gameplay, there's something here for you.

Completionist Difficulty:
This is a pretty easy game to get all of the achievements in as it only took me 60 hours to do so. If you take your time and explore, you'll 100% this game in no time.

Nitpicks:
There's too many ravens to shoot down and Niflheim is annoying to be in.",1699819206,1699819206,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

God of has one of the most memorable stories and even most memorable characters, because it isn't afraid to tackle important issues, to focus on themes and to flesh out the essence of the characters. It starts a bonding journey between the worst father possible and a troubled BOY, but slowly and meaningfully it becomes something much more.

This is quite the adventure and I was 'all in' within a few minutes of starting. In the midst of Norse mythology, it is a sweet and heartwarming story about a father and a son building a relationship.

For me, it was a tough game, as I don't excel in combat. Thus, I played on the easiest setting which still was challenging.  There is no real penalty for death (just try again) and the explicit save system has dozens of slots.

The fights are relentless... monsters and spirits just keep showing up along your path and you do not have stealth options to avoid them.  I used 'brute-force' combat (charging forth with weapons blazing) and learned a new level of coordination with my keyboard and mouse to control special moves and runic attacks. In between encounters, there are environmental puzzles to solve, scenery to take in, and some tricky moves to open doors and chests. What a journey and I'm sorry to see it end!

You will do a fair bit of climbing and jumping but (at least in easy mode), you can't miss a jump or fall off an edge. This was much appreciated! 

Completionists will need to grind through two extra realms/areas that become accessible towards the end of the game.. Neither added anything to the story (in my opinion) and I slogged through both in search of the associated achievements.

The rest of the game is, in a word, spectacular! Great story, characters, voice acting, cinematics, etc. The game world is huge and diverse and you travel by foot, by boat and (ultimately) by fast travel through mystic gates. There are more collectibles than one can count and it pays to explore every corner of every environment. Resources abound and it was only at the end that I was short on rare items when I was trying to upgrade armor and weapons.

I can't say enough good things about God of War.  If you like 'big' game worlds with a captivating story, like Assassins Creed Origins or Horizon Zero Dawn, then this game is definitely something you will enjoy.",1699577405,1699582859,True,59,1,0.839055001735687256,4,True,False,False

The experience was entertaining, amusing and a really good comeback of the series. The game experience is now a real challenge and you can easily die if you´re not careful enough, aside from that, the world itself invites you to explore and eventually grind in order to surpass any challenge that you may face. Maybe the combat can be a little monotonous at times and I also feel that only having one main antagonist feels a little... short? At least if we compare it to GOW 3, but hey, I assume that the developers wanted to throw all the meat in Ragnarok. Solid 8.5/10 and one of my best recent investments.

La experiencia de juego ahora sí es un desafio y puedes morir fácilmente si no tienes el cuidado suficiente, y además de eso, el mundo en sí mismo te invita a explorar y eventualmente fortalecerte con tal de superar cualquier desafío al que te enfrentes. Quizás el combate en ocasiones puede sentirse monótono y también siento que solo tener un antagonista principal hace que el juego se sienta... ¿corto?

No sign of getting old.

This is one of the best grooves in the business. An extremely relaxing and satisfying rhythm. A progression and balance honed and polished in a way that does justice to the great studios that still make products like this.

God of War 2018 is a leviathan of technical prowess, delivering comfortable and satisfying gameplay and a majestic presentation. It is a complete, refined and extensive package.

It may be a derivative game without many new ideas, but it executes all its concepts practically flawlessly and in a way that puts the competition to shame. 

Very few studios are able to compete for space within the same genre, on an equal footing.

GoW is an excellent game (And that's coming from a fan who has exhausted every scrap of content from the original games and this one).

But the real problem, in this patented Sony walky-talky-semi-interactive movie, is the awful writing.  If anyone told you it was good, you can be certain that they didn't pay attention, they have abysmally low standards, or they are remarkably stupid.  Regardless of why someone might praise this game's writing, just know that they should not be listened to at all in the future.

This game has absurdly stupid dialogue.  You know that the idiots writing it really think they are being thoughtful, deep, and insightful, but they are, in fact, just idiots.

The dialogue is either extremely, painfully ham-fisted, or embarrassingly smug fourth-wall-bending high school sophistry peeking through a tattered veil of deliberate vaguery and butchered metaphors.

The characters are all idiots as well, and motivations are both paper thin and absolute.  This game is terrible.

That wish being that her ashes are spread on the highest peak of all the realms, a simple journey on which Kratos gets to finally confront his son Atreus who’s education was mainly handled by his mother.

The game’s world rapidly expands as the player progressively takes in the state of this world and its lore. Personally I was expecting a linear story filled with confrontations against numerous norse gods but this is not really what God of War is about.

God of war is a bit of a semi open world which it gradually reveals after a dynamic start in the first third of the game. Things start to settle a bit and I began to slowly realise the scope of the game and the limits it actually contained.

What I thought was going to be one long epic journey filled with epic fights against mythical gods turned out to more so be an errand run around the lake of nine where one trinket after the next needs to usually be dug up to progress the main intrigue.

None the less God of War is an outstanding game with beautiful visuals and impressive sound design, it was the first time that a game ever made my jaw drop by its way of portraying gigantism as well through its visuals than through its sound design. 

The gameplay is very fun but after the two thirds of the game it grew stale for me, I do not believe the enemy variety was high enough to have kept me engaged and I am also not the type of person that found a lot of fun in many of the unlockable skills which mainly consist of additional combos or such rather than completely new abilities that might change your approach in combat.

I however do not doubt that if challenge is what you seek then a full knowledge of the entire combat possibilities that Kratos will dispose of throughout his journey will be necessary and rewarding to master.

The fact is that this is simply an amazing video game for which my expectations might have been a bit too ludicrous due to the high praise this experience gets. 

Although I did feel some disappointment in some regards I overall felt a lot of interest and excitement and those are the feelings I wish to remember the most out of my journey throughout the realms of Midgard.

I wholeheartedly recommend this experience and hope that you too may have an extremely pleasant time.",1698184813,1698185556,True,38,1,0.767767429351806641,0,True,False,False

Even if you buy this game at full price, it's worth it. There are many puzzles, but don't get demotivated because all of them are easy. So, if you were planning to buy it, don't think too much, just go for it. God of War is the best Sony port for PC; I didn't encounter a single bug or glitch. The main story is somewhere between 16 to 20 hours, and if you aim for 100% completion, it will take around 30 to 50 hours.

Also i was inspired to make this review because of GamingWins and his '' Everthing great about God of War 2018'' video. I hope he doesn't mind that i used some of the things he says in his video. I really think you should check out the video and his channel as a whole, he has some great stuff.

As a long time player who has played throught The original trilogy, including Chains of Olympus, Ghost of Sparta, Ascension and even Betrayal + Mimir's Vision and i have listend to the God of War: The Lost Pages of Norse Myth podcast, I love the spin Cory Barlog has put on the franchise and i would even go out as far to say that this is possibly a top 2 game, excluding Ragnarok because i havent played it yet, the other one being God of War 3.

The God of War games have always been more towards re-imagening the mythologies meaning contrary to popular belief, the God of War franchise was not based on true facts and events that have happened in Greek and now Norse myth, When you think about it, there is no way that someone can travel from myth to myth because they can and not even Tyr. Actually Kratos, or how he was known in greek myth, Cratus or Cratos actually was one of the most trusted by Zeus and he never killed Ares, anyways this in an entirely other subject i won't get into right now. What i am trying to say is that inaccurate doesnt mean bad and as already stated i love the spin they put into this game.

This next part contais spoilers.

There are a few things that are left as ''plot holes'' such as Atreus being Loki. This would have been impossible as Loki is an Aesir god and we know that Faye is a giant and Kratos, well he is from a distand land, plus Loki often switches between being good and bad in myth where this isn't the case in the game. Another thing i would like to point out is that when you first go to the lake of nine, Atreus refers to Baldurs mother, which we find out later is the Vanir Goddess Freya, As Frigg. In Norse myth it is belived that frigg and Freya are possibly the same person (No on really knows as all evidance is unclear or lost to time). This is a ''plot hole'' because Atreus would just call her Freya, but it i don't know really. In this ''universe'' She might use both names interchangeably. These two are the main and really the only ones that i think are majour. 

Now that we got the criticism out of the way Lets get onto the things that made me fall in love with this game. Firstly I absolutelly love the world design as character design. The most important thing is that we See Kratos as more matued right away, but he is still ''draged down'' by his past mistakes. He turns away from his son as he wraps his bandage around his scars. This shows a much more mature Kratos, but he is still unable to forgive himself because he doesnt let go of his past. The bandage here is supossed to show how he is healing from his past, yet it only hurst him due to how he is unable to show the mistakes of his past and acts as a permenet chain that haunts him. (like the ones from the Blades of Chaos). And we later see how he becomes free of the pain as soon as he lets go of the bandage (chains). The second thing i absolutelly love about his is that he doesn't use any contreactions in his speach, which is so easy to do, yet makes him feel so much wiser. I also like how he grows as a father figure to Atreus. Kratos has never been there for his son and doesn't know how to be there for him for like half the game. The only parenting style he knows is the way of a Spartan warrior which is harsh, unforgiving and unpatiened. Kratos still knows this is wrong and later realises this isn't the way to go and starts truly to build a conection with his son (the moment i am referring to is as soon as Kratros steps out of the light of Alfheim). I will stop there, but there is so much more to talk about. I want to touch on the whole Baldur-Freya situation quickly. Baldur didn't realise that the need for vemgence is what caused his demise. To forgive is so much more about yourself than the other person, only if Baldur knew that, this wouldn't have happend and the death of this pantheon would have been prevented. YET AGAIN vengence leeds to the demise on YET another myth. I would talk about Baldur and Mangi, but they are pricks not worth talking about. They are seld-entitaled brats. The secont to last character i want to Talk about is Atreus/Loki. The part i think is most important is when he finds out he is a god and becomes a prick. This is important for the story as Kratos was scared to tell him the truth bacause he feared he would turn out like this. However Kratos managed to turn him around and make him good. This is where Kratos knew he should do everything he can to prevent the past from happening again. Last character is one who isn't present - Faye. Faye was the one who allowed for Baldur to enter the woods as she
marked the trees that she wanted Kratos to cut down. She knew that Kratros would think that Atreus wasn't ready so she marked the same trees that protected the woods. If it wasn't for her this journey would never have happened. Also Mimir is such a cool character that just makes this game so much more lively and gives us context that is important to the story. The world building and graphics.... ohhh don't get me started on the graphics. When you got that fuck-off sony money this is the AMAZING game you get.

Now for some of the small details that make we love this even more. When Kratos throws his Axe into the Lake of Nine and the World serpent returns it imbuded with Etir. Etir is the posion of the world serpent and the only thing that can kill Thor. If the axe is imbuded with it, it has the ability to kill Thor and This is why Kratos has the ability to kill him. I also love love how Thor is presented as A drunk and irresposible person which is actually true to the myth, contrasting our common missconception of him as A ''brave and fit hero''.

The game is stunning, has a compelling story, a rich lore and universe, yes.  The character's have personalities, yes.  But, really the combat is kind of clunky. Enemies have annoying abilities and I wound up throwing my axe a lot of the time because many enemies can dart in and out of melee range quickly and in seemingly unpredictable ways. It got frustrating after a while. Controls on PC seemed unnecessarily complex, and skill trees introduced new controls and abilities that were neat and impressive to look at, but felt rather gumpy in the context of actual combat. I would just panic and use my strongest ability. Such is fighting ""AI"" in every game I guess, they're usually just flighty and angry and rather boring to fight against.

God of War, the 2018 reboot of the iconic series, is a transcendent gaming experience that spent 21.5 hours unearthing the depths of Norse mythology. This reinvention of Kratos and his journey is a tour de force in storytelling, gameplay, and emotional depth.

One of the most striking aspects of the game is its narrative. Kratos, the former Greek god of war, now embarks on a new adventure in the realm of Norse mythology, alongside his son, Atreus. The story is a masterfully woven tapestry of parenthood, redemption, and grappling with one's violent past. It's a journey that is as much about self-discovery as it is about gods and monsters.

The relationship between Kratos and Atreus is at the core of the narrative. It's a portrayal of fatherhood that is both poignant and deeply moving. The way the game explores the complexities of their bond, as well as the secrets of Kratos' past, makes it a storytelling triumph in the world of gaming.

Gameplay in God of War is a revelation. The game transitions from the traditional fixed camera and hack-and-slash combat of the original series to a more cinematic, over-the-shoulder perspective. The combat system is visceral and strategic, with a Leviathan Axe that can be thrown and recalled, as well as Atreus' ranged support, adding depth to the battles.

The world of God of War is a breathtaking and expansive rendition of Norse mythology. From the towering mountain of Midgard to the realms of Alfheim and Helheim, the game's environments are not just visually stunning but also integral to the narrative. The interconnectedness of the world creates a sense of immersion and adventure rarely seen in video games.

The attention to detail in God of War is staggering, both in the environment and the characters. The game's art and character design are a visual feast, and the voice acting is nothing short of exceptional. Christopher Judge's portrayal of Kratos and Sunny Suljic's performance as Atreus are particularly outstanding.

Throughout your 21.5-hour journey, you'll encounter challenging enemies and epic boss battles. The sense of accomplishment when overcoming these obstacles is immensely satisfying. God of War strikes a balance between accessibility for newcomers and depth for series veterans.

In conclusion, God of War is a monumental achievement in the world of gaming. The reboot takes a beloved character and reinvents him in a way that deepens the narrative and emotional resonance. With 21.5 hours of playtime, you've experienced the full breadth of the game's storytelling, gameplay, and breathtaking world. It stands as a testament to the potential of storytelling in video games, proving that they can be both emotionally gripping and artistically stunning. God of War is a journey that transcends its medium and is a must-play for anyone who appreciates the power of a well-crafted narrative in gaming.",1697696451,1697696451,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 Kratos has evolved so much as a protagonist that he seemed like a completely different character at the beginning of this game. However, as you continue to play and learn about what has happened ever since we last saw him, you begin to realise that he has just grown as a person. A more mature, experienced, seasoned, wise, evolved Kratos is the protagonist that a story so emotional such as this one needs. The presence of young and sweet Atreus is a wonderful addition, he's just such a great companion and I don't only mean this from a story perspective, he was actually very useful in both combat and exploration as well. The game manages to hook you with its intriguing narrative and compelling characters that you end up liking a lot (shout-out to Mimir, Freya, and the world serpent, ilyall), while still having astonishing graphics and a really varied game-play, i.e., exploration, diverse combat systems and builds, plenty of different enemies and collectibles, side-quests, etc. 

 This third-person action-adventure is definitely a change from its prequels, but it doesn't mean something bad, it just means that it has adapted to today's trends. I am glad that this saga has been able to refurbish itself and is now thriving, it truly deserves to be as widely acclaimed as it has always been.",1697434440,1697434440,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

   The narrative intricacies of ""God of War"" are akin to a carefully woven tapestry. Kratos's journey, now set in the Norse realm, is a testament to the writers' commitment to character exploration. The game's opening, with the intimate funeral pyre scene, immediately establishes an emotional connection. The unfolding story, seamlessly blending Norse mythology with Kratos's personal odyssey, creates a narrative tapestry that is both epic and deeply personal.

**2. Character Development:**
   Kratos's evolution is not just a surface-level transformation; it's a profound metamorphosis. His struggles with the burden of his past and the challenge of guiding Atreus through a perilous world provide a depth rarely seen in gaming. Atreus, a pivotal character in his own right, grows from a curious boy to a vital companion. The nuanced interactions between father and son are scripted and performed with such authenticity that it elevates the emotional impact of the entire narrative.

**3. Visual Spectacle:**
   The visuals are a visual symphony. The game's use of the single-shot camera technique, a technical marvel, immerses players in the world without interruption. The attention to detail, from the subtle expressions on characters' faces to the dynamic weather systems, contributes to a level of realism that sets a new benchmark. Each realm, from the vibrant Alfheim to the desolate Helheim, showcases the artists' dedication to visual storytelling.

**4. Combat Excellence:**
   Combat in ""God of War"" is a choreographed dance of brutality and finesse. The Leviathan Axe, a weapon with its own narrative significance, feels weighty and responsive. The combat encounters are meticulously designed, requiring strategic thinking and adaptability. The progression system, with its array of skills and upgrades, empowers players to tailor Kratos's abilities to their preferred playstyle, adding a layer of personalization to the combat experience.

**5. Puzzles and Exploration:**
   The puzzles are not mere obstacles but integral parts of the narrative and world-building. They range from simple environmental puzzles to complex brain-teasers, seamlessly blending with the game's progression. Exploration is not just encouraged; it's rewarded with hidden chambers, lore-filled artifacts, and encounters that enrich the player's understanding of the Norse mythology underpinning the game.

**6. Sound Design and Music:**
   The sound design is a symphony of its own, capturing the crunch of Kratos's movements, the echoes of combat, and the ambient sounds of the mythical world. Bear McCreary's musical score is a masterclass, adapting to the emotional beats of the story. The use of a Nordic choir, singing in Old Norse, adds a layer of authenticity that enhances the immersive experience, making every moment more resonant.

**7. Metaphorical Depth:**
   Beyond the surface narrative, ""God of War"" is rife with metaphorical depth. The game explores themes of cyclical nature, the consequences of one's actions, and the interplay between fate and free will. The integration of mythological elements serves as a canvas for larger philosophical discussions, inviting players to reflect on their own journey within the game's narrative framework.

In essence, ""God of War"" earns its five-star rating through an unparalleled commitment to narrative, character, visual, and auditory excellence. Each element is not just a standalone feature but a crucial thread in the rich tapestry of gaming brilliance.",1697216333,1697216370,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Some fight mechanics I didn't really understand at first like the Baldur fight which led to me wasting a bunch of time, or the fact that there isn't much of a reward from ""freeing"" the valkyries even though they are probably the most difficult encounters in the game. At some point I had to buy gear to do the trials to get even better gear, then it started to turn enemies back to normal instead of big damage sponges.

Muy buen juego de acción y aventura con elementos RPG medianos. Muchos lugares que explorar. Enorme cantidad de tesoros por obtener. Finalmente una excelente historia bien escrita que no me esperaba de un juego God of War.

Muy buen apartado musical y los gráficos son sorprendentes. Siempre hay una misión que hacer, un tesoro por desenterrar o alguien mas a quien ayudar.

Definitivamente un juego digno, divertido y de buena dificultad.
