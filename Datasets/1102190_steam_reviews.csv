You must protect the train carrying the last remnant of hellfire by deploying a variety of (mostly cute) demon characters and spells to fight off waves of angels attempting to storm the train. Runs clock in at a svelte half hour ‚Äî a good lunch-break length.

While choice to stack the levels vertically instead of, as one might expect for a train, horizontally is a bit odd, the theming gives the game a distinctive look-and-feel that sets it apart within the crowded field of turn-based fantasy deckbuilders. You choose from a variety of factions with distinct powers, such as the Umbra, which devour smaller units to grow stronger, and the Melted Remnant, whose units despawn after a few turns. There are just enough hints of lore to make the world feel robust. Think Snowpiercer if it were populated entirely by Dark-type Pokemon. The soundtrack is also a total banger.

Monster Train is strong in most areas of roguelike design, but geometry it blows out of the water. The train has three levels, not counting the pyre room; within a level, units on both sides are organized in a row, which has limited space. Enemy units enter on the bottom floor, exchange attacks with the allied units targeting whichever unit is currently in front, and then move up to the next level.

The geometry, therefore, functionally has three dimensions: Horizontal, vertical, and time. To hit an enemy, an allied unit usually needs to intersect it in all three dimensions. A lot of the strategy revolves around placing units so that they intercept enemies enough times to take them out before they reach the pyre room; a common failure state is having an army that deals enough damage mathematically but not in the right place and time.

The key to the brilliance here is that the three axes all function differently. In a game with a grid map, ‚Äúone square up‚Äù and ‚Äúone square to the left‚Äù are functionally the same, but here, ‚Äúplace the unit one level up‚Äù versus ‚Äúplace the unit adjacent‚Äù can have wildly varying outcomes. A choice like ‚Äúmove all the units from level 3 to level 2‚Äù can be a game-winning move. This kind of strategic thinking is why I lean so hard on geometry as a design pillar.

And that‚Äôs Monster Train! Overall, this is a solid, well-thought-out game with tight mechanics. While the gameplay can get somewhat repetitive after a lot of replays, especially the seemingly-endless Covenant ranks, the fact that it‚Äôs gotten to ‚Äúa lot of replays‚Äù status in my library is in itself a ringing endorsement.

UNTIL I PLAYED IT MYSELF. It's definitely a wild experience and the variety between gameplay runs is quite intuitive. Easily my favorite part is how you can get a deck that you can run with and then get a head scratcher of an enemy set you are pitted up against to overcome. THAT, is what I like. It has nice challenge without adding too much fluff to make it feel bogged down or overbearing and it is quite fun in all aspects I'd say. Another strong point for me is the awesome soundtrack. That in of itself adds to the game as well as the other artwork of enemies, NPC characters, and champions and other characters alike.

Monster Train is a Roguelike Deckbuilder like Slay the Spire but with its own twist to the game. You have three levels to fight on, with a fourth floor that is the heart of the train, and if that goes to zero, you lose the run. 

The enemy attacks your allies, and then that repeats. In the multiplayer mode, you are challenged to compete against other people to beat the same seed better and faster. I like this approach to multiplayer.

They just added Workshop support to the game. Each time you beat the game, you can choose to make the game harder. You choose two allies to start your run. As you play, you will unlock more allies and cards. I am updating this review to say that I think this game is near perfect.

Monster Train is a roguelike deck building game with similar mechanics and features as other such games, but with a unique twist: the presence of a board state, similar to TCGs like Magic. Your mission is to protect your hellish train's engine from angelic invaders. There are three levels to the train (not including the engine itself), which makes for a lot of different gameplay situations. At times, you will have to fend off attackers on each level of the train. Turns can therefore take a lot of time to think about, as there are a near-endless amount of options to take each turn.

This complexity can be overwhelming at first, which is probably the reason why I did not immediately dive too deep into this game. The learning curve is steep for sure. Once you get over it, you will see that the game has a lot to offer. The complexity opens up as you stick with the game, as you discover the wealth of valid strategies and broken card combinations.

I'm 75 hours in so far with no end on the horizon yet.

There are just so many different ideas to try, and so many that feel utterly broken right up to the point you find what counters it. I've lost count of how many times I've said ""hehe, I've got this game figured out now"" only to be humbled a few turns later with yet another new discovery of something I either hadn't realized or hadn't yet fully understood.

The artwork and sound design are superb. So many little details that are just so satisfying.

The positives - the game has a lot of personality, the different clans that serve as the base of your decks are unique with their own fun mechanics, there's a good amount of depth, there's lots of ways to ""break"" the game, and each run doesn't demand too much time so this game works really well if you only have a short time to play. 

The negatives - the game can be really chaotic and it's often easy to totally lose track of what's even going on, the game falls into the common pitfall of ""some cards are must picks and many cards just straight up suck"", and other than a couple bosses most enemies feel pretty samey. 

Though to be honest those negatives aren't huge. The game is a lot of fun. 

I think the most important thing to call out here is that this game is NOT Slay the Spire. They're very different games with their own take on the deck builder genre. A lot of strategies that Slay the Spire rewards will backfire on you here. This isn't a bad thing. The reason I'm mentioning this is because I immediately got a lot better at this game and had way more fun once I stopped trying to play it like StS. For example, StS encourages you to ramp up energy per turn and your strength scales largely through passive powers. In Monster Train you're encouraged to double down on strengthening a couple cards and playing them as frequently as you can. Card Draw as a result is waaay more important in Monster Train than in StS. 

Slay the Spire is the better game between the two, but Monster Train deserves a spot in your library if you like deckbuilding roguelikes. Pick it up, it's a lot of fun.",1704759104,1704759173,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, unlike most rogulike deckbuilders, the game lacks closure. You just finish a run and that's it. In the standard version of the game, there's no true final boss, no secret boss, nothing. Once you unlocked the main heroes, there isn't much to look forward to, rather than just being a completionist.

I'd be fine with that. However, I noticed they've added a true boss that could bring closure in a paid DLC. I can not in good faith believe that this is priorizing game quality over greed - and that to me, is what's been ruining the gaming industry lately. 

It feels like they left it out of the main game on purpose, so that more people would buy the DLC - and to me, letting core content out of the standard version is worthy of a negative review. 

DLCs are fine when it adds extra heroes, cards, artifacts, etc on top of an already working product - so they are mere complements to the core experience. But something that is as crucial to the experience (to me) such as having proper closure and a proper final boss is a huge letdown. Beating it in standard version feels like you never actually beat it.

I have played many deck-building games and most of them fall into the same general format, Often they end up being shoddy knock offs of the original mechanics, card design, and game play loop that Slay the Spire nailed so perfectly. This is not that! It brings tower defense and rouge-like deck-building together in a fun unique hybrid that i really enjoyed playing hundreds of hours. And on top of that it has a fun multiplayer survival gauntlet mode that's worth playing.   

Monster Train isn't your average Slay the Spire clone. Sure, while it definitely scratches that deck-building itch, but it throws in a three-lane vertical tower defense twist that changes the game experience and strategy depth. Instead of static encounters, these monsters advance toward yours bases core as they climb floors, forcing you to juggle defense across multiple fronts Similar to Plants Vs Zombies.

Monster Train really embraces the power of card combos, letting you stack buffs and exploit mechanics to create ridiculous Damage or Debuff machines, It's not just about winning; it's about witnessing the glorious Frankenstein's monster you've built tear through the opposition.

While the learning curve is steeper than a Hell-bound express train, the payoff is immense. Every victory feels like a hard-earned conquest, a testament to your deck-building prowess. and once you feel like you've got the mechanics and progression mastered you can go online and play some multiplayer survival matches, where you try to out last or out score you opponents on a parallel run. This is a pretty neat feature that densest get the amount of credit it deserves for getting competitive multiplayer Deck-building to feel fun and functional.

The game has several clans, of which you pick two, one primary and one secondary. Primary clan provides champion unit, which is the reason why it matters, which clan you pick first.

Each clan has it's own pool of cards and they tend to certain play style. Which means that with every run you will be combining (mostly) two decks to synergise and support themselves. This interaction is the main factor that makes the game extra fresh experience for the first 600-800 hours; the game's initial content is not added, but multiplied together. If the developers decided to create one new deck and add it to the game, they would functionally add another 40% of already existing content via clan combinations and possibilities. Yes, [i]40%[/i] increase by creating one clan (there are 6 clans at the moment of this review, DLC included). The more I play, the more I adore this detail.

Of course, such game design comes with a caveat; since each deck potentially interacts with another, it means that balancing the game is extremely hard. One nerf might make some cards unpickable, another buff might make some card combo completely broken. The game doesn't try to be perfectly balanced, as often the fun you achieve in the near-end stage of your run is over-stacking and insanely boosting your strategy beyond being broken.

Overall, I had a lot of fun. I think I'll continue to have more. If you like deck builders, getting insanely strong and broken combos and a fresh variety while playing the same game for hundred of hours, I'd recommend you to try [i]Monster Train[/i].",1702753996,1702753996,True,25,2,0.733711898326873779,0,True,False,False

Most things are extremely well balanced, though I feel like the Stygian race is noticeably weaker than the rest. Though I might just not be seeing the power plays they can make as easily as the other races. The only way to I can do well with them is if I use the first hero with a focus on frostbite. But I've not found other winning strategies for them.

The art is good, the music and SFX are excellent. It all feels like a AAA game masquerading as an indie game. It's an easy 10/10, which I don't give often. I'd probably give the Slay the Spire a 9.5/10 due to its difficulty curve.

To begin with I have always enjoyed building decks but roguelikes tend to take an approach where you are supposed to master extremely barebones repetitive games with some sprinkles on top and the occasional bone the game throws you.
Which means a lot of your enjoyment hinges on the perceived quality of the basic game mechanics and their balancing, as you need to consider your ability to clear a game with extremely limited resources and options.
I get bored easily and quickly because a lot of them lack variety from the get go and increase their difficulty without a sense of progression within the game. Getting better at a game doesn't mean much to me, it's something that happens incidentally as I spend time with something I enjoy. 

What makes Monster Train such a treat is that it offers 6 different clans to play with a combination of two of them on every run. Each clan has 2 leaders each, each of which level up thrice throughout a run into 3 different specs that can be combined. Leading to a lot of variety and ways to experiment off the bat and throughout. Generally, this game gives you the most consistency among the roguelikes I have played, which makes it immensely fun and more realistic to experiment with certain builds as opposed to other games where you need pure luck and 200 runs to try out some build you thought of. The game has a collectible card aspect where you unlock new cards with cleared runs and bonus frames for clearing the extended difficulty runs. So you are encouraged to clear the game with even weird builds for a sense of progression. It is superficial but all this extra work on the presentation makes the game a joy to play. The presentation is generally fantastic even though the animations are extremely underwhelming. Monster Train is somewhat easy to start with but can grow quite challenging later on. Not to mention the DLC adds new extremely cool and surprising mechanics to the game that utterly change how you perceive units. I am far off of beating the game but I see myself coming back to it occasionally. 

Looking at the negatives, I think for extremely dedicated people it may not be hard enough, and Slay the Spire has tighter balancing, with much more weighty decisions moment to moment. The increase in consistency also means that after 100 to 200 hours, a lot of your runs might feels samey. This is great in my book as that is about as long as I am willing to play a single game anyway but it might be bad in yours. Also, the DLC is fabulous but the extensions and difficulty it offers have left a few champions behind to an extent where getting a win can be hard on higher ranks. I wish the developers had balanced the game around high covenant playthroughs because unfortunately my favourite hero is probably among the worst in the game. Among the dozen or so roguelikes I have tried, this is possibly the one I have enjoyed the most.",1701085512,1701085512,True,4,0,0.568965494632720947,0,True,False,False

One of my favourite roguelikes for sure.

Pros:

+Countless Card-Synergies, every playstyle is legit
+Lots of differently factions and combinations between them
+Polished graphics and sound
+Tons of content to unlock, goals to achieve, etc (The steam achievements on the other hand are easy)
+Deckbuilding and Tower Defense Genres are perfectly mixed here
+Optimal length of a single run (~45 minutes and you are done)
+You can read tons of lore in the encyclopedia if you want, or even show it ingame.

Cons (nothing really, I feel that you should always point out negatives as well, but they really are minor issues (except for the DLC, you will see later here)):

-The Endboss variations differ a lot in difficulty, which was quite annoying during my ""early"" runs. This is offset by the fact that you can see the endboss-variation right from the beginning on and build your deck accordingly.
-This is more or less a general roguelike problem but I point it out: Sometimes the rng just lets you loose and you can do nothing about it. Or sometimes a slight miscalculation from your side will result in a devastating loss.
-THE DLC!: I have grinded through the base game and only THEN the DLC is worth it, when you absolutley thirst for more content. Otherwise it is more likely to ruin your experience.
To break the DLC down: it ramps up the difficulty very high but lets you build ""broken"" decks. Sadly it results in mostly unfair games, a high likeliness of trail and error and makes a lot of factions and synergies useless. So basically you are fine without it (it does not create new steam achievements as well), you give it a lot of patience so that your experience is not ruined or you finished the base game and want more content.",1698926976,1700343971,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a former Hearthstone addict, Monster Train scratches the right itches without hooking you on a monetization treadmill. It's at least on par with Slay the Spire, and an improvement in many regards:

- Fast-forward toggle option lets you skip through long combat chain sequences. I REALLY appreciate this game for being considerate of the player's time. There are no tedious filler animations to wait through.
- The art is quite polished and the character designs are charming. The style is a bit tongue-in-cheek while still being cool. Very comparable to Hearthstone's aesthetic.
- The final boss is indicated at the beginning of the run, so you can draft your deck accordingly.
- Cards you win playthroughs with receive special borders, incentivizing draft variation between runs.
- Your in-game logbook records your win status with different clan combinations, so there's tons of replay value.
- RNG is thoughtfully incorporated without hinging massive swings. It serves to break up monotony more than it ever feels like a slot machine. You are guaranteed to draw a playable unit every turn, which really smooths the gameplay. 
- The ""floors"" of the train create an interesting strategy dimension for unit placement.
- You can save-scum by exiting to the main menu in combat. This restarts the battle from the beginning, forgiving your errors. 
- While there is no PvP mode, daily challenges let you compete with other players for high scores. 

A typical run for me takes 30-45 min average. This game really hits the sweet spot of being elegantly in-depth while pleasantly casual.

 Plenty of depth and a diversity of builds; I really like the concept of trying different mash-ups with the ""clans"". The daily challenge is always fun with a pseudo multiplayer element to keep it interesting.

More than 3 years later: I still play this game, almost daily. Not only did this game stay fun for more than 20 hours, it stayed fun after 50, 100, 200...Combined on Steam and my Switch, I've played well over 500 hours of Monster Train and it's one of my favourite games of all time. If you're into deckbuilders, this one is the best, hands down. Absolutely incredible game with one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. 10/10 stop reading and go buy it.

Original Review June 2020: This is the first deckbuilder game I've played and I'm absolutely loving it.  Maybe I'll get bored of it after 20 or so hours, but after just a few short hours, I can see that this game has a ton of depth and will probably keep me busy for hundreds of hours.

Game loop is pretty good, fast paced combat, with stuff to do in-between. I quite like that you get to do multipl stuff at once between fights, and not just one, like say Slay the Spire, it feels more rounded.

Unlocking new stuff feels pretty good, and the ""duo class"" combo makes it fresh. Picking the same due combination and the champion, just the 6 or how many starting cards difference can completely change how you play your run, the strategy you did previously might not work at all.

Lots of experimentation, iv played for 10 hours and only got the first class to max level and second half-way through. There is 4 more that i havent even touched.

Monster Train plays great, the mechanics are solid and fun, and the art and animations are bright and colourful. It isn't difficult to see why so many people gave it a thumbs up. If you like PvE card games or rogue games, you'll most likely enjoy this.

It is a good game, and it's always nice to have another decent single player card game, but unfortunately I'm sick of rogue games.

There's nothing like having a great hour long run going, not even coming close to losing... and then having the rug pulled out from under you because you ran into an enemy that cannot possibly be beaten. It's like, ""Well... I was having fun and did want to keep playing, but..."", the game decides nope, that's it for you. Back to the start. It's great fun while I'm actually playing it, but then I'm left with a sour feeling at the end of each run, only wishing I could have kept going and having zero desire to start from the beginning again with an entirely new random setup.

This game is great for anyone who just wants to play for short segments at a time. Otherwise, if you want to play for long stretches, be prepared to start from the beginning over. And over. And over again. There really isn't that much variation between runs to justify all of this meaningless repetition. Just let me play the damn game. But they won't, and you can't because randomisation in games has become the new padding to make up for lack of content and to give the illusion of a full game experience.

I mean, I get the idea. I've played enough of them. Get as far as you can, level up, go again. It's been done to death and I'm sick of it.

Plus, I'm not fully on board with the whole being on the side of hell versus heaven thing. I never did appreciate games like this. Especially where they try to make hell look good. The fuck is that? Some people take the concept of evil quite seriously, while others think it's a theme. Hades, Bayonetta, Monster Train... they all want to make you think being evil is cool for some reason.

It isn't hampered by odd design decisions or misunderstandings about what the player would want from this type of game. It feels polished and well intentioned. Still, for all of the pros, there are a few cons that seem to be baked innately into this sort of game.

Pros:
1. The game is built around handing the player a massive number of possible upgrades and modifications for their cards and units. This allows for an unreal number of possible synergies, some pleasingly game-breaking, and gives the game a very wide-open feel. 
2. Monster Train's varied factions each have several potential archetypes and synergies that play with the other factions in fascinating ways. Some of the concepts, such as units feeding on other friendly units to gain strength, or units that burnout like candles after a set number of turns, are really unique.
3. The Covenant levels and unlocks give the initial hours of the game an extra dopamine kick that may hook players initially as they come to grips with the game's mechanics. There is a lot here for completionists.

Cons:
1. Frequent non-gameplay. This is a byproduct of the game's design, with its multiple floors and waves of enemies coming over time, so its hard to call this a design flaw. However, often a winning strategy involves buffing a tank-y unit over and over again each turn. Spending five or ten turns playing the same few cards over and over isn't particularly engaging. 
2. Gameplay density. To that end, moments of meaningful decisions often come primarily at the start of a run and decrease as you progress. Decision making is the core component of any good roguelike, and towards the end of a run, especially a busted one, things can get a bit dull. The game encourages player's to make a deck that does one thing, and to optimize that one thing into the ground. 
3. Lack of visual immediacy. The presentation of Monster Train is about as good as it can conceivably get, so again its hard to call this a flaw. Still, its hard to know if your floor will be able to take out the next wave or the boss in advance, short of some guesswork or a calculator. Combat previews help the player understand what will happen next, but for future waves and the like it's hard to know for certain at a glance. 
4. The game doesn't feel like a card game. When cards can be changed so fundamentally, or when the deck is thinned to the point of doing the same thing every turn, and given the RNG-mitigating effects of things like priority units being drawn each turn, it doesn't feel like you're playing a card game.

I really enjoy that game so all the possibilities that come from being digital make this a no-brainer for me.  I love Slay The Spire, but this takes from that, adds Xenoshyft, and runs.

Another thing I love about this is the difficulty.  Instead of starting off impossible and slowly getting more possible (like 99.9% of roguelikes/lites), this one started easy and seems to get more difficult as you go on a win streak.  Three runs in and I haven't lost yet, but I can sense it coming.  A lot of people would count this as a strike against the game, but I really don't understand why more games aren't diverting from the norm and taking this route.  I do love roguelite elements (Hades, For the King, etc.), but it is refreshing to be able to start off easier and progressively ramp up the difficulty until you lose and break your win-streak.  I hope more games take this route.

One extremely minor gripe (not even so much against this game specifically) is that I am sick of this look/style.  I know there are limited budgets regarding how these games look, but it'd be cool to see it done ""better"".  I don't know how else to say it.

Steam really needs a review systems with more options than just ""yes"" and ""no"". I can wholeheartedly recommend this game, but the fact that this has almost as good a rating as Slay the Spire is criminal. The balance of the cards is not on the same level. The DLC increased the powerlevel by a lot, which made very many vanilla cards useless.
By comparison, in StS you can put only about 10% of the cards into the dumbster tier, while in Monster train almost half of the cards are bait most of the time (either needing insane levels of setup or very niche moments to shine or just bad in general).
Especially the new Endboss makes many strategies unviable (which were fine without the DLC). Of course many of this criticism only applies on high covenant (the difficulty mechanic in MT). For casual play, the overall experience is really fun and the mix between deckbuilder/towerdefense feels very fresh. If the devs would have balanced the game with some patches, it could be a 9 or even 10.",1692479491,1692479491,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

You beat it or die in 30 minutes - 1 hour, but as the difficulty scales with your level of play, every decision feels particularly weighted.  The game also feels more fair than other deck builders.  In Slay The Spire you could have a great deck, with a balanced defensive card representation, but still not draw a single defensive card when you need it most.  The tiered train, allows the developers to scale these things best out of three turns, so defeat feels less like a single, unfair hand.   

The expansion is also amazing, as it rewards you with new enhancements, even allowing players to combine units to make over powered hybrids, but as you take on these great buffs you also increase the difficulty.  Accrue 100 difficulty currency (pact shards) from these new upgrades and get an especially difficult boss for a more absolute victory.

[i]-wrong character[/i]
[hr][/hr]

[b]Monster Train[/b], a gimmicky card game that doesn‚Äôt feel overcomplicated and fills the void of roguelike card games by not copying the most famous example, instead creating and maintaining its own identity throughout.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Pick a main faction and a supporting one and you‚Äôll get a base deck that includes a mix of the two.

Besides the usual upgrades such as decreasing costs of a card or increasing its damage or giving it various proprieties as well as many ways to restock resources, duplicate cards and find new ones the game spots a very particular encounter style.

[h1]X-Factor[/h1]
You are on a 4 floors tall train, enemies will enter in the lowest and each turn move up by a floor to reach your 4th in order to damage your lifebar that you‚Äôll have to keep for the whole run, so it‚Äôs paramount that you deploy units on each floor seeing what units to put in front to take the burnt of the damage while trying to figure out or plan out what spells and abilities to use to weed out damage dealers in the enemie‚Äôs backlines.

Each encounter has a boss, some major some minor, but all will lock themselves on the lowest floor on the last wave and battle on until either they or your units are dead.

It‚Äôs sounds like a lot but despite that every mechanic, ability and run is very easily memoizable.

An extra layer comes from the different playstyles the various factions, and by extension the various combinations of them have, maybe you‚Äôll choose to stack arboreal tanky units in front while the much harder hitting demons stay in the back, or maybe you‚Äôll try a run with the oceanic spellcasters that get more powerful with every spell you cast combined to the emberblighted that further specialize in buffing to have units exponentially scale in power .

[h1]Story[/h1]
A very simple one, the angels have finally defeated the forces of hell and extinguished its flames, only for a small faction to survive, trying to bring the last spark that could ignite the underworld again to the pit.

[h1]Downsides[/h1]
My only gripe is a few generic tracks and VERY bland design of the game‚Äôs units and enemies.

But being an STS clone isn't a bad thing. In fact, Monster Train improves on several mechanics that make even more fun to play than STS. 

First things first, the train tracks. Like STS, you get to choose your path en route to the next boss. BUT what is good about MT is you can see which track offers the ""best benefit"" based on your situation, so it wise to switch things up and drop your one-track mind of just picking strong units. The benefits can be seen in train sight: one track shows you health recovery and an artifact, the other gives you a new spells, a unit and gold. 

Another cool feature of MH are the monsters. You get a primary class of monsters, supported by a secondary class. Each class has their own unique spells, units, and play style. You can choochoochoose which classes to get that best complement each other. 

The game IS quite short though, so it's perfect for those quick breaks during a busy day of work (one run will take 15 mins at most since you can automate it -- to an extent). The final stop (after you've defeated the boss) is a bit disappointing, unlike in STS which had a ""true ending"" mode.

The visual style can be a little off-putting at first (looks a bit ""mobile game-y to me for some reason) but once you get used to it, it becomes one of its strengths. Really adds a lot of character to the monsters, and helps with visual clarity.

Each clan has its own strengths and weaknesses, but the real strength of the game is that you can pair any 2 clans to fuse their playstyle. For example, if your bruiser clan is taking too much damage to survive to the end, you can pair them with the tank/healer clan to give them the survivability needed to maximise their damage.",1691942373,1691942373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You are the conductor of the hell train on your path to the abyss or something. On your way there you will be attacked by enemy encounters that want to destroy your pyre to stop the train from moving. Once the battle starts and the first wave of enemy units enter your train on the lowest level, you can play cards that summon monsters or play spells. Then the enemy units attack your placed units, your units attack theirs and then they move up to the next level on your train. Then you draw cards again and can place your units and cast your spells. Once they reach the fourth level, they will attack your pyre. Once the pyre is destroyed, you lose the run.

After some rounds the final boss of each encounter will spawn and instead of going up after one round will duke it out until the boss or your units on that level are dead.

After your successful encounter you have a moment of brief respite and get the chance to add cards to your deck, improve your cards or pick up relics that grant you some sort of benefit.

This makes Monster Train a deck-builder with some tower defence mechanics.

There are 5 (6 with dlc) clans that give you unique cards and champions. You have to pick a combination of two of these, with each clan having two champions to choose from. This creates up to 80 (120 with dlc) unique starting decks.

At the start of the run, you can see the main boss encounters which vary in their respective strengths and weaknesses, so you should build your deck accordingly.

You can create heavy tank builds which damage your enemies with thorns or frostbite, stack multistrike on your damage dealers and buff their attack value, summon endless hords, revive your units, debuff your enemies or simply let them fall back to the bottom floor.

With the right synergies you can create exponentially growing feedback loops that can kill bosses even before they enter your train.

Monster Train has a rich micro cosmos to explore, to learn and to apply with daily challenges adding a fun long term element of replayablity.

- [b]Upgrading Cards:[/b] Finding the right upgrades for your cards and stacking them is very satisfying. Having two upgrade slots and sometimes even three or more makes for some fun opportunities to increase the power of your best cards. 

- [b]Duplicating:[/b] Fully upgrading a card and then duplicating it is some of the most satisfying things I have done in games for a while. Especially with the merging of minions that the DLC includes. What is better than one overpowered minion? 

- [b]Synergies:[/b] You will be keeping your eye out for finding cards and abilities that fit well together. Because there are many to find. You have a great ability that happens on strike? Put some multistrike on that minion!

- [b]Lots of Content:[/b] There are more than enough cards, artefacts and upgrades to play around with. I was more than happy to play with the first 3 factions and the many combinations they provide. Each with 2 different heroes you always have at your disposal at the start. The 5 factions in the base game make for so many combinations that I have barely touched the DLC faction. As you are playing these factions you will slowly unlock new cards for them as well. And even when you have unlocked everything there is still the daily challenge, modifiers, achievements and of course the accession levels to unlock.

- [b]Leaderboards:[/b] A lot gets tracked in the game, your history to the detail of the individual choices you made. All to be compared with friends or other players.

- [b]Seed saving:[/b] A neat little feature is that you can save the seed of a run you just did and share it with friends to see how they would do. You can even turn them into challenges that can be shared with the community.

- [b]Satisfying Sound and VFX design:[/b] All the impact, rewards and just general feedback on every action you take is well done. It never gets annoying.

[h1]What I didn‚Äôt like[/h1]
- [b]Can‚Äôt observe battle when choosing:[/b] Some cards let you make a choice in the middle of battle. Like returning a specific card when it was consumed. But there is no way of glancing at the battle once you are on this screen. 

- [b]Boss stats:[/b] At the start of your run you can see what the three bosses will have for abilities, but there is no way of seeing it again once you start the run. So it either becomes a memory game or you make a screenshot/photo with your phone. This is quite bothersome. Thankfully there is a mod for it.

- [b]Hero upgrade possibilities:[/b] Every hero has three different upgrade possibilities and at the start it takes a while to know what they are. Since this is something you can always synergise with it would have been nice to see the three possible upgrades in the clan select window. Instead I now had to open the logbook everytime I forgot.

- [b]Easy Early Runs:[/b] The first two runs I did were not very challenging. The end was reached without trying too hard. It would have been nice to set a starting difficulty scale that would adjust. There is an XP system that rewards you more the better you play, but this only means you unlock all the clans and cards faster. The ascension levels take over this role later.

- [b]Losing units:[/b] At first when starting the game I was surprised to see my units not going to the discard but losing them for the entire battle. There are ways to heal them or increase their maximum health in battle but it still felt bad. Losing one unit could make things spiral out of control. Only after a couple of games did I understand that this is the core of the game. Later you also unlock a faction that turns this upside down with cards that return previously defeated units. This is a small gripe I have with the game. Maybe the tutorial should be clearer on this.

- [b]Intro video:[/b] The cutscene video when you start the game is nice but it would have been great to have an option to turn it off. Thankfully there is a mod for it.

- [b]Hellrush matchmaking:[/b] There is still enough players doing the daily challenge for a filled leaderboard but the hellrush‚Äù mode is dead. I waited for an hour on a Friday evening and didn‚Äôt get any matches. 

[h1]Why others should try it[/h1]
It took me a while to write this review. Everytime I wanted to submit it I wanted to refresh my memory and got stuck playing the game. If that is not recommendation enough I don‚Äôt know what is. The DLC is great too.

It's really fun how you get you choose two ""clans"", compared to Slay the Spire's one character at a time. It produces some super interesting and unpredictable synergies - unlike in Slay the Spire where the synergies are obvious right away. I also love how you can upgrade any card in a lot of different ways, which can sometimes lead them to be useful in ways which they weren't before. I often find that most of the drama/hardship in Slay the Spire comes from whether or not specific cards show up (randomly) in your options, whereas this game feels more dynamic than that. I think this is because there are a ton of ways to mutate your deck, some from random events, but from some the multiple different shopkeepers. It makes it feel like your choices have a meaningful impact on whether you win or lose and it's not just left to chance.

Maybe the only downside is that this game has very few mods available, and when you do use them, they disable progress through the game, whereas Slay the Spire has tons of working mods out there which have significantly prolonged my interest in it.

Coming from Slay The Spire (spending around 120 hours in that game), I couldn't find a roguelike and deckbuilder which was similar enough, but also different and varied enough to StS to scratch the same itch. Chrono Ark, despite being an amazing title, didn't cover the same feeling of enjoyment that StS did.

That's when I saw Monster Train on the steam store. Whilst initially I believed it to be some cheap mobile game port going by the font, art and screenshots, I looked closely and saw many elements resembling that of Slay the Spire, and was immediately interested in picking up the game. This was no mistake. The game, fundamentally, follows the slay the spire / roguelike deckbuilder gameplay, with spells, items, relics and story events etc to find on your journey. However, as aforementioned, the game switches it up and adds some very interesting caveats which instantly hooked me further. 

There will be more to come on this review once I hit the higher levels and unlock the rest of the covenants (I've been victorious in one run so far, and the variation I currently have, as well as all the variation and rewards ahead of me suggest that I could easily spend another 60 hours or so in this game. In any case, I intend to write a much more detailed review at that time but wished to create a review early to say the following:

If you are looking for a game like slay the spire, but believe you have more or less exhausted StS vanilla content, then try this game. It's fantastic.",1689011369,1689011369,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While superficially similar, it's very different from 'Slay the Spire' in that you manage a roster of heroes and spells, levelling them up and deploying them on three levels to fight the increasingly difficult waves. Although you start out with only two factions, there are five factions in the game which you unlock by summoning heroes. from these, you choose your main faction which gives you a champion unit witrh special abilities and a support faction which gives you spells and unique heroes.

The very early stages are a cake walk which can lure you into a false sense of security because the difficulty ramps up after three of four encounters. Then you see the need for devising a consistent upgrade strategy. Levels are quite short and can be played through quite quickly and then you get to choose your upgrade path, allowing you to upgrade your spells on one path and your heroes on another. And you can discard some of your cards or heal your pyre.

There are a tremendous number of synergies to explore here. How you upgrade your champion, which heroes to pair it with, there are so many possibilties here.  I've yet to unlock the last two factions but I'm already spoiled for choice as to what to do each run. There are even a selction of really powerful spells which can only be cast on the floor below your pyre so there's a lot of fun to be had here.",1688983018,1688983018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1102190,141740224,76561199049265223,0,5,7939,0,2158,1705565854,"I recommend the game Monster Train for newcomers to the card battler genre. Monster Train offers a simple and easy-to-understand gameplay, but with your own creativity, you can come up with hundreds of ways to combine cards and strategies to create your unique playstyle. This game features clever design, unique game mechanics, and visually stunning graphics.

I know many of you are curious about the differences between this game and Slay the Spire (STS), so I will provide a detailed comparison of these two games below, so that maybe someone reading can decide on which card game roguelite they'd wanna pick up first.

Both of these games are roguelite deckbuilders; every run you start with a basic set of cards and then progress by slowly drafting more cards level by level to make a more cohesive, synergistic deck. The key difference being, you mainly use damage and block spells in Slay, while you use units in a tower defense-like layout in Train. STS was the first notable game of its kind, and Monster Train is quite derivative but unique enough that in some ways it might even be the better game.

Both feature lots of build variety, run variance, interesting pathing, some really creative cards, and of course some juicy, juicy synergies. I wanna make a fair argument for each, and give 3 examples per game of a strong point it has that might make you consider it over the other.

STS - Strategy: There are many, many ways to make a viable deck in Slay The Spire. You don't have to rely on getting all the right cards for a build, in fact the best players don't even think in terms of ""builds"" but just draft cards to tackle the individual problems that lie ahead. On the other hand with Monster Train you might find yourself going for the same few optimal combos again and again. In particular there's a unit upgrade called Multistrike which effectively doubles or triples the impact of any damage scaling plan you have. While it's not required to win, it's kinda silly how it makes almost everything you do better.

MT - Synergy: You can totally break both of these games with absurd combos, if you know what to look for and get a little lucky. I would say it's more fun to do in Monster Train tho, you will get these broken runs more often and imo it feels better to see a row of super-buff units hold the line against hordes of enemies, than to nuke the enemy in 1-2 turns in Slay (though of course that is fun too). MT also makes card duplication and removal much more accessible, so once you come up with a winning strategy it's much easier to have it materialize and be consistent. More often than not, your final deck won't have any fluff. Each clan also has unique starting cards which means certain synergies can get rolling faster, as opposed to Slay's basic Strikes and Defends that you get with every character. On top of all that, the DLC's unit infusion mechanic takes everything to the next level, basically letting you smash 2 units into 1.

STS - Balance: There are 4 characters in STS and 3 of them are so different yet so well-balanced with each other it's a marvel. The 4th character Watcher is admittedly more consistent than them once you understand her, but the way she scales is so unique that it's fun to play her as well. You have characters that do all sorts of different things, from proccing effects by exhausting all your cards, to poisoning enemies and then turtling up, and yet all these characters and even the strategies within them are not much better/worse than the others. Genius design. In Monster Train though, some clans and champions (basically your primary unit) are definitely better than others. Sometimes you might even throw the champion away. Even within the clans there are certain units and strategies that are straight-up better, especially after the new enemies added in The Last Divinity DLC. At low Covenant levels, it won't be too much of a problem though.

MT - Content: Slay's art style is unique for sure, but to be honest Monster Train's is just a lot better. Aesthetically the things you're doing, the units you're controlling, the enemies you're fighting and how you're attacking each other, looks awesome. The soundtrack slaps, the card art is animated, everything has interesting flavor text and a lot more lore than Slay The Spire. I have to admit when I first played STS I was a bit put off by the designs, and I didn't really experience that with MT. There's also a Logbook that keeps track of your achievements and progress in a more in-depth way than Slay does, and is more convenient overall.

STS - Difficulty: Some people want a challenge, a game with a very high skill ceiling, that will take months and months to master. Slay The Spire is for those types of people. Ascension 20 is brutal, especially with the bonus boss that I won't spoil. On the other hand, Covenant 25 in Train is still a relatively stress-free experience, and the secret boss of MT does hard-counter certain strategies but it's not too much of a difficulty jump, just more specific in the problems it wants you to answer. I try to keep up with both communities and have noticed MT winstreaks go into the several dozens, whereas in STS even a streak of 10 is very impressive. It's very satisfying to make all the right plays, reach the boss all cut up and bruised, and eek out the win with your rag-tag collection of cards that you were smart enough to make work together.

MT - Difficulty: Wait, again? Yeah I decided this was a strong point for both of them depending on your perspective. Monster Train is still plenty challenging in its own right and it does not hold your hand, but it is more approachable and gives you more tools to make the perfect deck. As previously mentioned, duplication and removal are more accessible, in STS you'll be lucky to even duplicate one card. But also, you can put exactly the upgrades you want in units and spells, whereas Slay's cards have preset upgrades. Making any spell you want -1 cost, or be held over for every single turn, would be absurdly broken in Slay The Spire, but in Monster Train it's a regular occurrence. It's also easier to avoid permanent damage, while STS has you constantly taking chip damage. You get more rewards between each combat, while STS might have you fighting several enemies before your first shop. I could go on. A lot of what you'll get used to in Monster Train could make Slay The Spire look brutal and frustrating by comparison, while still being difficult enough to be rewarding.

I honestly can't say which one of theses games I prefer. I want to say Monster Train but that might just be recency bias, and the fact that I'm new to card games so I lean towards the more accessible one. But hopefully these key points helps you decide which one is more your style. I can honestly say both of them are some of the most addicting games I've played. I have yet to play other deckbuilders like Roguebook or Griftlands, but the bar is set very, very high.",1688972022,1688972022,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, if you compare it to STS, the extra steps and the suboptimal status indicators make every turn take longer without any reason. It simply lacks the straight forward plain gameplay that STS has. Now, it comes with a few extra things, like having basically two tribes that form your deck, and you can alter the cards' stats. But if we compare it to a more fleshed out and complex Deckbuilder, like Griftlands, it simply does not stand up.

The positioning mechanics are interesting at first, but sadly very bland after an hour and not worth the complexity. The multiple floors are interesting at first, but not having the whole battle visible at once gets tiring quickly. I got it on a 60% sale, and probably won't play it much further.

I like the tower defense part, but for the price tag it gets repetetive very fast. Every deck a very smoll number of monsters & spells and you end up aiming / shooting for the same thing over and over. Other synergies just do not keep up in tempting you to try them. Especially when they take super long to set up / build, but then the run is over after what is it? 5 battles? It feels sad at first to be kicked out of a smooth run, and in later difficulty feels like you were meant to have more time to build something before facing the boss. Decks at that point are half finished at best, killing the aspect that's meant to be satisfying and the actual fun of ""succeeding"".

If there was more different cards / options / modes(1) outside of the DLC I would probably upvote it. But I am not getting enough playtime out of this. The first 12 or so hours were enjoyable, the last couple sittings I forced myself to keep trying as I did not want to waste my money.

However it didn't click as much for me, maybe because it stands in a weird uncanny vally where the game is overly produced, but the UI and overall information on screen are so cluttered it feels like an unprofessional mobile game. It's really hard to quickly understand everything that is happening since there is a wall of text in every direction

I'm sure if I've spent a lot of playing time it would all eventually feel natural and I could just enjoy all the details and make the most of all the mechanics the game has to offer, but everytime I feel like playing a quick game, I just go to an alternative.

Still recommend it, since there is a lot of effort and gameplay to enjoy, and it seems there are regular updates. But if you are a fan of Slay the Spire and wanted another fix, there may be better games for you, like Dicey Dungeons or Griftlands, both extremely well-designed and, in my opinion, have a way better user experience than Monster Train.",1607828592,1685140570,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Reminding myself if I should revisit and if you should purchase.

[b]ELEVATOR PITCH: On Par with Slay the Spire[/b]
LIKED: A different twist on the popular card battler genre using tower defense, the ability to mix factions into a deck, and creating some abusive OP combos. It's a breath of fresh air compared to the constrained, stress inducing, tactical, can‚Äôt mess up a decision ascension runs that is Slay the Spire. If you like seeing big damage numbers pop, this would be your jam. As you can see, I didn't hit the 30 minute review threshold, I went over the damn thing because I was having too much fun!
DISLIKED: I guess the demonic theme may turn some off, but I really think it's the snobby gamer who thinks Slay the Spire is the only card game in town is the real audience missing out.

It actively encourages you to fuse cards essences to strengthen other cards, has magic or unit upgrade shops depending on which rail road path you take,  and it just offers so much freedom and creativity with its gameplay. Im still finding things, like for example, freezing the bone dog card, which prevents it from being played, and giving it hold over means it will restore five pyre health, every single turn.

Very diverse roguelike: a lot of different in-game mechanics lead to many random-overlapping choices, with may result in some insanely crazy combinations. With that much random the game feels somewhat unbalanced (in player's favor), but also very fun. You can win with very, very different approaches, which is very satisfying.
 
Once you realize that you can restart any battle from its beginning - it becomes rather difficult to lose in this roguelike. But, often you are playing with such haphazard crazy decks, that 'restart maneuver' transforms the game into an interesting puzzle, where you have to find a path to victory.

Also: the music is amazing. One of the best orchestral soundtrack I've heard in games. Practically every single track is great, the boss ones are just masterpieces (my favorite being Fel and Archus themes). Though the most beautiful track (called The Descent) is in the credits, accessible right from the main menu. According to corresponding achievement - only 15% of game players heard this one. A shame.

10/10 - Monster Train may be unbalanced, but very fun gameplay-wise

It's too easy: The first ten covenant levels can be a tad easy, sure, but those levels are largely where you are being exposed to what works and what doesn't in the game. Does a unit and spell combo ""sort of"" work at covenant 10? Then you will be absolutely clobbered 20+. In the ""easier"" parts of the game, pay attention, even if it feels unnecessary. Learning which unit infusions work and which ones don't can be the difference between winning and losing later on.

There isn't enough content (not enough enemy units, not enough effective strategies): The later portion of this complaint tells me the player didn't learn the game. There are so many cards that appear low-value at first but are game-changing when upgraded in a certain way or paired with another card. The complaint about there being a lack of enemy units is fair enough.

The game is ""shallow"": A similar complaint to there not being enough effective strategies, which is completely ridiculous. Underpowered units can find their place in a covenant 25 run and not even the most unfortunate run generation is beyond conquering.

To sum up once more, this is a more accessible slay the spire. Unlike the aforementioned game, you won't have to sit in a single combat for an hour+, trying to figure out just a handful of turns with a calculator. This game has plenty of depth in deck-building and combat strategy while avoiding the strenuous and, at times, overly random nature of slay the spire.",1681286056,1681286056,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While the scripted artifact and card drops may make the game easier in some ways, they don't detract from the fun of playing the game. In fact, the real enjoyment comes from the clan interactions, which provide a lot of variety in terms of playstyle and strategy. 

What's even better for people like me is you can actually start and finish a run in one sit. The game doesn't overstay its welcome. Unlike Slay the Spire, which can sometimes feel like a slog, Monster Train's runs are relatively short and sweet. This makes it easy to jump in for a quick game, and keeps you coming back for more.

I lost my Roguelike virginity to this game!
This game wasn't a simple, seen it and bought it... I went on a flippin' journey for this one!

Welcome to my essay on why Monster Train can have my babbies:
Let's set the stage: I got 3 free months of XBox Game Pass from Discord more than a year ago.
Not wanting to waste those 3 months, I held onto the code right before it expired, then activated it and started to explore all the possibilities. I didn't wanna waste time trying to download Halo or something, so I just downloaded a bunch of games that were small in file size. However, even after downloading these games, I struggled to play them... The thing is, I like to consider myself a Gamer, but I find myself lacking in what the kids call ""Gamer Energy,"" and because of this, more often than not, I stick to a small handful of games I enjoy, barely straying from said games.
Modded Minecraft, Terraria, Stardew Valley, Sudoku, Picross, A whole lotta Nintendo Gams!
I enjoyed playing games that had a story, gave a bunch of tasks to do, or just let you solve some shite.
RPG, Action, Adventure, Survival, Platformer, Puzzle, Strategy, Rhythm, Shooter, Beat-em up, Fighting!
I liked many genres, and my indecisiveness helped me not stick with a single genre for long.
Though, with all these great genres, there was one genre that I really despised... [u] Roguelikes! [/u] [b] DUN DUN DUUUUN! [/b]

No, but seriously... I didn't like Roguelike games for the longest time.
Since I lacked that ""Gamer Energy,"" playing a game where starting over again was the main idea had me looking at these games as if they were just throwing your hard work away to start a fresh game... [b] BOY WAS I WRONG! [/b]
Since I was having a tough time playing the games I downloaded from Game Pass, I felt that I needed to force myself to play ANYTHING before I lost my membership.
[i] ""Oh look, a Roguelike. I can play this, and then when I lose within 2 minutes, I can just quit and get on with my life."" [/i] - Said the naive Roguelike Virgin.

I played a round and lost. [i] ""But, I feel like that was going somewhere..."" [/i]
I played another round and won. [i] ""Wow, that was a neat build, but I feel it could've been better..."" [/i]
I played ANOTHER round, and then I realised that the round I was playing was actually my 10th, and it was almost 5 in the morning.
After that night, I felt like I needed to show this new wonder I found to someone.
So I got my lil sister to sit down and build a deck with me; after that round, she asked me if we could do another one. Then, the next day, she asked if we could play it again.
[b] WE SPENT THOSE 3 MONTHS PLAYING THIS GAME! [/b]

This game surprised me... I played Slay the Spire before this game, and yet, for some reason, Slay the Spire didn't click with me. Though, after playing this game, I went back to play Slay the Spire and found that I was able to enjoy it a bit more the second time... I also started to try out other Roguelikes, and now I have many new Roguelikes occupying my wishlist. Monster Train changed me.
When the 3 months were up, I went straight to Steam and bought this game without a second thought. I haven't done something so impulsive in years, and usually now-a-days when I buy something that isn't groceries, I get a bit of buyer's remorse... Yet, this triggered no such thing.
I did it for the core game, and the moment they released DLC, I did it for that. LATER, when it was released on the Switch, I bought that motherducker without ANY restraint!
They're still working on the Google Play version of the game as I write this, and I'll tell you this now: I'm buying it. [b] ZERO SELF-CONTROL!! [/b]

I love this game and only hope that it can grow in popularity.
Ever since they released the workshop, I've checked on the mods all the time to see whats new, and for some time now, there hasn't been anything...
It has its fans (*points at self*), but there just isn't a lot of noise going on for it compared to other Roguelike games doing similar things. Though I still cross my fingers every night when I drift off to Sleepytime Junction for this game to blow up and get all the attention.

Sorry for this long-winded review... I just really love this game, dude!
Please, for the love of all that's lovely in this world, [b] SUPPORT THIS GAME! [/b]
It's a great Roguelike card game where you are trying to save Hell from freezing over.

[b]What can I say?[/b] Monster Train is one hell of a game! Pun intended. From the moment I started playing, I was hooked. I purchased the game at 8pm last night, and before I knew it, the clock struck 6pm the next day, and I had already logged over 16 hours. That's right, more than Dead Space, which I've owned for over two weeks.

The game's premise is simple: defend your train from the forces of heaven with a team of monsters. But don't let the simplicity fool you. There's a lot of strategy involved in building and managing your deck, choosing the right monsters, and upgrading your spells and abilities.

The graphics are beautifully designed, and the music fits the game's hellish charm perfectly. The gameplay is challenging but not frustrating, and the replay value is excellent, with plenty of customization options to keep things fresh.

If you're a fan of card games or strategy games, Monster Train is a must-play. And if you're not, well, you might just find yourself addicted like me. All aboard the Monster Train!

Monster Train is a well loved addition to the roguelite genre. However, it didn't fit with me. There is clearly a large structure in place to keep runs changing and evolving over time. However, in a singular run fights can feel very similar. Part of the issue is that Monster Train is close to an auto battler. You place down your units in a specific order, possibly use a spell or two, then you let the scenario play out. When I first started I though including a fast forward button was silly, now I realize that even on the fastest speed I see myself reaching for my phone as the blurs on screen play out as they will. I know people love games like auto chess, but that combined with each fight in a run feeling fairly similar with small adjustments I just don't feel like an active participant.

Monster Train is a roguelike card game - which means that it doesn't contain a campaign mode or anything of the sort. Instead, you'll be battling the same enemies and bosses, but using different cards. Subsequently, you'll unlock more cards that you can play with. There are several suits (or colors, if you like) of cards in the game. Each of these suits is represented by 2 heroes, which are powerful cards that are always in your opening hand. At the start of your run, you choose a hero and a support suite (which must be different from the one your hero is in). You get some random starting cards in both suites, and off you go to the first level. A standard run consists of 8 levels packed with artifacts and opportunities to improve your deck. There is a fight at the end of each level, and a boss in each of these fights.
There are only several different mechanics in Monster Train, mostly associated with a single suit. However, you can still make interesting decks that are bursting with synergy - and ultimately, that's what card games are all about. There really isn't that many cards in the game, and you'll soon know them all by heart. Alas, that also means it won't take long to see all the game has to offer. When you become completely familiar with the game, a run only takes about half an hour or so. Somewhere around that point, the game stops being amusing.
Monster Train is cleverly designed, simple and fun. I would recommend it to anyone who likes deck-building and the combinatorics of card games. It's a shame it doesn't feature more cards and enemies, the game would be a lot better.

It's the deckbuilder I've played the most by far. There's so much replayability here! Lots of factions, each of which can be primary or secondary, each with their own set of cards. It has a cool tactical element in that you have to play units to specific floors, unlike just playing cards directly to reduce enemies' HP.

It lets you feel smart and strong since you basically have to combat the enemy's absurdly overpowered units with your own overpowered units :)

Your deck is comprised of one champion, a variety of units (which may be placed onto floors of the train to fight), and a variety of spells. Cards primarily come from a pool of three sources: your champion (who comes with his/her own set of basic default cards), your primary clan, and your secondary clan. With two diverse champions within each of the five factions, there are 40 (=2 * 2 *  (5 Choose 2)) truly unique combinations to experience.

Pros:
[list]
[*] Great diversity all around, from the feel and interaction of the factions, the champions, the events, and the enemies.
[*] The overarching implementation of leveling up your deck after each fight through the a choice of one of two tracks to take (each of which with different rewards) lent a sense of control and strategy to the deckbuilding.
[*] Each run was easy to get into and was of the perfect length.
[*] Imaginative unique creatures.
[*] Deck refinements (card upgrades, trashing cards) were well done.
[*] Extremely well-priced on sale.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] All single-player, turn-based games need an Undo button for deterministic moves. Mis-clicks happen.
[/list]

Summary: I finished Rank 25 with all 40 combinations. I found some of the combinations a bit too taxing (i.e. you need good luck overall with your offerings), but that may be expected with so many interactions. On the whole, I found that the Rank 25 difficulty was right where I wanted it to be (as compared to StS which I personally find much too hard) and all combinations had their own source of enjoyment to find. I got a great deal of time out of this title and for anyone who enjoys card-battlers, this is an easy recommend.

It's a deck builder where you're not overly stressed about your choices, since it's abundantly clear when some card or relic will launch your deck into the synergy stratosphere. Hp isn't so precious, and defense isn't always necessary or rewarded, so you spend more time leaning on the gas and less time making responsible decisions. 

STS worked because you felt extremely smart identifying synergies, and could only Break the Game every so often. Monster Train works because the line is so clear that you can just sit back and feed off the power start to finish. Remains to be seen how that nature affects its infinite-replayability score vs other roguelites, but I will at least stick around long enough to get through the in-game completionist incentives. Easy recommend for any fan of deck builders.

The game was fun for the first 7 hours but I think other roguelites offer more value than this one tbh. I did play the game for 45 hours actually but I feel like the only reason I did was because I was bored and this is the sort of game that's good to play while your listening to a youtube vid for example. It wasn't a bad time but most of my playtime has been really mid with this game.

I'll start with the good things about the game. Game mechanics are fun and the game has strategic depth. It has creatively designed cards and overall the gameplay, while it derives a lot from Slay The Spire, has a lot of personality. The game is relatively easy for a veteran card gamer, but it gets challenging with the covenant levels and I feel like the difficulty curve is extremely fair. The game is also pretty intuitive to understand.

Alright so here are the issues. I feel like winning doesn't feel satisfying enough. I think the main reason behind that is because a run is pretty short (30 min) and also there aren't enough surprises along the journey. The way the encounters and bosses function is quite monotonous as well. Tho the biggest problem this game has is it's repetitive nature, lack of content and a lack of unique strategies / deck archetypes. The pool of cards for a given class is too small and while the game has a cool dual class system, it seems like most classes don't mix well together, so it seems like you only wanna build your deck around your primary class and only take some cards from the secondary. Also I feel like another thing that amplifies this issue is that most classes have extremely strong starting cards. This makes it so that as you increase the difficulty of the game, you end up having to build more and more around these starting cards, which suppresses experimentation. Also the game gives you a lot of agency over how many cards you're able to purge/add to your deck. On paper that sounds good, but what this ultimately means is that there's no need to improvise and there's no risk in fishing for the right cards and rejecting everything that doesn't match your vision. The only exception from this monotonous deck building is that sometimes you find cool artifacts that you can build your deck around, but unfortunately it's pretty rare, since most artifacts in this game are basic. So this game is really fun when you're still figuring out which cards are good and which ones not, but after that it's really mid, and that's the issue.",1677582276,1677582276,False,0,0,0.459132194519042969,0,True,False,False

I was put off at first by the weird name and cartoony, hearthstone-clone, F2P-look the game's store page has, and only bought it because it was heavily discounted. I needn't have worried - underneath the slightly strange branding there's an absolutely stellar game.

The mechanics are perfect - it's easy to understand but hard to master. Card games can be difficult to get right - it's often fairly straight forward to play 'optimally', and then you're basically at the mercy of the RNG and just along for the ride. That's certainly how I felt with Hearthstone. But Monster Train gets it right: there's still a lot of RNG - it's a rouge-like after all - but there's a lot of strategy as well in terms of what you play where; which battles you choose to fight and which you leave to a different floor. There's also a good amount of 'right, how can I make this deck work?' too; there's not [i]that[/i] many opportunities to draft units, so while you can have an ideal build in mind, you have to be willing to change direction.

I've spent many happy hours playing Slay the Spire, but this has replaced it as my 'I've got an hour to kill, what can I do?' game. It's easy to drop into and easy to save and come back to if you can't afford the full hour a run typically takes. There are still cursed runs, just like in any roguelike, but it's still enjoyable even when you're never drawing right. And when you get a bit of luck and a build that really synergizes: it's a blast.

My only critique is that I wish it were easier to 'come back'. Usually when a run starts going bad it's really difficult to recover.

With that price in mind, I would almost recommend the game. However, I think the game is clearly lacking in many aspects. 

After 15 hours on the game, the only thing that comes to my mind is: ""Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle"".
The first 10 hours of the game feel great, you unlock many cards and clans, you learn things, and all is good.
But after that, you soon realise that every run is just the same and that the more you unlock, the weaker you actually get (while enemies kind of stagnate despite their buffs). A lot of great cards are quickly unlocked, but higher levels cards feel more like obstacles than potential assets. They will just dilute the previously owned good ones, preventing you from playing the way you want. 

Difficulty levels are also way too numerous. They put the highest to 25, but you need to win as many times to unlock it. The problem is that there are not that many differences between each level of difficulty, leading to very repetitive runs. You don't feel any progress. ""Why?"", you ask. Because there is absolutely no variety in terms of enemies or bosses. 2-4 runs are enough to see all bosses and enemies. That's it. Nothing new later on. I get that it is to prevent too much randomness, but added to the fact that you only have a very limited amount of events, and that every (of the two) path you can choose from is quite the same, you end up repeating the same runs over and over just to get a slight penalty and worse cards. Add to this that most of the big bosses are HP sponges, and you get very few viable options for clans combinations and decks.

The game is far from being horrible, it would be a decent 3/5. But it gets stale pretty quickly.
For these reasons and because I know that there are better options on the market for the same range of price, I cannot truly recommend it.",1676898246,1676898369,False,12,1,0.566110193729400635,0,True,False,False

These are two completely different experiences. 

The easiest place to start is the core gameplay experience. Both games have similar core gameplay loops where a player's combat capabilities are determined by a deck of cards. Within combat, this deck is shuffled so a player never knows exactly what combat capabilities they will have going into a turn. Cards have an associated cost to play and affect the gameplay in any number of ways. The player moves between combat scenarios and intermissions where they may affect the content of their deck of cards as well as observing special events/healing/etc. If player health hits 0, the run is over and if the player is able to kill the final boss, they win the run.

I think the most obvious difference between the two games lies in understanding how they want the player to learn and execute optimal pairings within combat. First of all, of the 4 StS classes, none of them have one ‚Äúbest‚Äù strategy. Each of them has numerous strengths and synergies that can bring the player to the final boss. In general, I would describe the cards/relics as ‚Äúdeliberate.‚Äù Interactions between cards/relics/potions are intricate and it‚Äôs difficult to explain without knowledge of the game. The important thing to understand is that cards/relics impact each other in surprising ways. This is exemplified by the fact that each card has one specific upgrade that can completely change the way the card can/should be used. So more often than not, the decision to take a card/relic depends heavily on the makeup of the current deck and if there are valuable synergies to be had. The problem (and where the real strategy comes in) is that there are enough cards/relics and few enough opportunities to add them to your collection that going into a run with a strategy in mind is just about a premature death sentence. When two players win separate runs with the same class, it‚Äôs all but guaranteed that they were forced to use different strategies. Even two players on a run with the same seed will likely end up with polar opposite decks. Then, of course, is not knowing what enemies one will encounter until they get into a fight and not knowing what boss they need to prepare for until they defeat the previous one. For players to be successful, StS requires that they be adaptable and understand how cards/relics work together while having the forethought to decide if a card is worth taking when there is no guarantee of getting the other card required to maximize the deck synergy. 

While the run-to-run variability within a single class is definitely present within MT, it's to a much lesser degree. Relics/cards don‚Äôt quite have the same ‚Äúdeliberate‚Äù nature to them. Each class has a narrower scope than the 4 StS classes, so a given run will have more obvious playstyles and cards are more easily adapted to a given run as cards have 2 upgrade slots and the player is able to pick from a list of modifiers as opposed to one unique one. Within battle, the major strategy comes from knowing when and where to summon your monsters as you have 3 combat floors all occurring at once. Each floor has a maximum amount of monsters it can hold, and each monster has its own effects/strength/health. Bosses are mostly the same and predictable. Overall, strategy lies more within liking the playstyle of a given class and understanding how the different classes interact with each other. It's still satisfying killing the final boss. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs better or worse, just different. You‚Äôll get the itch for one and then the other. If you like StS, this is worth checking out.

More ""classes"", more unlocks, more build variety, added late-game challenge, and a bigger pool of bosses make Monster Train a bigger bundle, but the on-screen instant math that helps you calculate if targets will perish, keeps the pace every bit as fast as Slay the Spire (which again, I love) while having three full lanes of action to balance with. 

The soundtrack is one of the best of the year. It has a real momentum and weight to the action tracks with the ambient tracks having nice mix of strings and older instruments that keep an engaging atmosphere.

You get a diversity of factions' combinations and their champions but quickly learn that not all of them are equally good, some provide really good synergy while other combos have antagonistic effect.

It's probably just a me-thing but the gap between synergistic factions/champions/secondary cards and these that feel like they're not supposed to be used together is so huge that I feel like 60-70% of an apparent customization is neglectable.

For me, deck-building roguelites require a certain nuanced depth to keep you pulled in: the itch to start a new run and a need to progress. Spire, in each combat, can at times be blunt, but much of the play requires calculation. You can't just play the same every single combat, even with a particular deck. Monster Train however seems to trend in the other direction, where the deck is played the same in every combat, and either it works or it doesn't. The depth in play isn't there within a single run. Across runs, yes, but then runs take too long to get that return. So, when I'm feeling that urge to play a casual game like this for a run or two, it's simply much easier to just jump into Spire. The return is better.

Why Tower Defense feels? You try and place your units as tactically as possible on 3 floors. Waves of enemies will enter the train and they will keep ascending, unless you vanquish them in time. When they reach the 4 th floor, that's a problem because that is where the heart of your train is (called Pyre)... it can defend itself, but also has limited health. If the Pyre reaches 0 health: It's game over, man! Game over!

The game stays interesting to play, because there's different Clans to unlock which offer different styles of play. By playing these Clans, you will unlock more cards, items and map events, which will expand your deck possibilities and ultimately survivability.

The real challenge in this game begins as you up the difficulty (called Covenant level). These Covenant levels are comparable to the increase in run difficulty in other Deckbuilders. There's a Leaderboard (with your Steam friends on it) and more unlocks to motivate you to keep playing, trying to incrementally beat the available Covenant levels.

There's also a DLC for Monster Train that will offer even more variation and flexibility, but I haven't had the urge to touch it yet, as I'm still learning the ropes in the base game. 

Definitely worth your money!

1. When you beat the game you unlock challenge mood which makes the game much harder as the enemies unit and bosses (particularly the bosses ) power up as you power up which makes the later round bosses too hard.

2. Seraph the chaste.  Is a boss that is just way too over powered as his buff abilities make the fight unfair and near impossible to win.  His first ability reduces the buffs on your units by half and the negative abilities on enemies units by half which makes it harder to power up your units to be strong enough to kill him and his second buff causes him for the first 15 hits that he does on your units to heal back the damage worth that he causes for these hits.  This means that you either need to kill him very fast before he starts attacking or do enough damage and have your unit be strong enough to over power the heal;th regain when he start to attack which is not easy because of his ability to half the buff values on your units.

As I play I wish there was a better solution to super battle speed.

Addictive and satisfying, this game does a great job at making you want to keep unlocking cards and factions to play around with and add to your strategies, allowing for some wiggle room with snowballing and becoming god like in the later levels. The three floor system is unique, I found it tedious at times because I found the cards that incorporate them as a mechanic weren't as useful as a straight up spell or unit cards and wasn't worth the mana resource, but I loved setting up units in a kind if tower defence feeling way.

Compared to others in the genre it's not as difficult (Although it has challenges and modifiers to supplement this) and the runs feel quite short, I find this makes it more addictive and tempts you into testing out the modifiers and covenant levels. Losing isn't too frustrating because you'll still pick up exp and faction levels based on achievements during the run.

Pros:
 - Addictive and satisfying
 - Varied play styles and factions to mix with
 - Seemingly endless challenge and difficulty modes add to the play time

 - Can feel repetitive despite variation, due to run length, the same bosses, enemies and back drop

Easier than Slay the Spire, but with a metric ton more variability and options than Slay the Spire. Even at covenant 25, I always felt there were multiple routes that I could take to get to the win, whereas in Slay the Spire every run at the high ascensions just felt...the same. 

Breaking strategies are certainly easier to pull off than in Slay the Spire -- hell, the game encourages it -- but I also find that as part of its charm.

The theme is pretty neat. I have a soft spot for the ""devils are the good guys"" plot. I ran a Pathfinder game that was more or less this, with a supremely powerful tyrannical oligarchy of angels as the bad guys. 

The game doesn't have a complex story, which might be a minus to some, but it's great when all you want to do is sit down and play some strategic battles with digital cards. It is what it is and I like that it doesn't try to be more. :) Each of the playable races has its own quirks and specialties, and being able to choose a secondary race makes for varied and interesting card synergies. I am a fan of the aquatic race that's very direct-damage oriented. :)

The difficulty is not so punishing it's un-fun. I've only won maybe 2-3 times at the time of this writing. I know people who have won much more. But I've made it a point to do the extra achievements every level so I can max my gold input, which does tend to get more dangerous the further your train goes through Hell's gates.

I've found more hidden combos in this game than any other card game I've played. And on top of that I've had so many ""This deck is NOT going to work out"" and then it brings a victory.

My 2nd run ever was already busted.

Almost 1 tapped him with just my juiced imp LOL.

I had some artifact that made spells free if they were below the cost of the played spell, so in combination with +draws, I was basically casting a full hand of buffs each turn to steroid the hell out of my imp.

Very cool combos/synergies so far, and the ""four train floors"" mechanic is actually pretty cool that adds another layer of strategy to how you wish to assign units.

Different factions means the game changes pretty wildly between play throughs.

The game starts simple and gets as difficult as you would like. If you can stay alive and focus enough you can achieve most any build you would like on lower difficulty (covenant). You have to adapt on higher difficulty.

I am 35.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

You choose a primary clan and secondary clan, which function similar to a ""class"" system, and you can get cards from both classes during your run.
I really enjoy it, but the variance is a blessing and a curse. Each run feels very unique but sometimes it just doesn't go your way and the game hits you with a level you aren't prepared for.
There is a large emphasis on balancing big upgrades that also increase enemy difficulty, so you need to carefully decide if you need the power-level increase or keep the enemies weaker.

If you don't find a broken combo to exploit, chances are that you're done.

Personally, I'm not much into tower defense games. This game had overwhelmingly positive reviews and it seemed like a card battler, so I bought it on sale. It was not until later that I realized it was not a kind of game that I liked, and that instead of using combos with your cards, you use your cards to lay towers to defend yourself with and support them, while your opponent plays a completely different game.

The game is good; that is undeniable. It has variability, it leans hard of trying to make itself fun to replay over and over, and you can tweak it from pretty easy to punishingly hard; it always tries to make you play it in a slightly harder mode, dangling unlocks and golden fonts for you so you'd want to.  I don't have a problem on how well it is made, how polished the mechanics are, how nice the graphics are, or nothing like that.

I simply didn't like it as a personal preference. I don't like tower defense as a concept in general, and I mistakenly bought one without realizing it. I even got the DLC before checking that it was something that I would most likely not enjoy, even after seeing a short video, not realizing what I was in for.

I got annoyed at the game the moment I realized the second umbra champion basically requires you to luck out and roll the monster that keeps the bonuses early on to make him really worth taking over the starter champion. (no it doesn't require it to win, but it makes the second hero purely luck based and kind of pointless if you don't get the purple rarity monster early)

Another game where you are just going to hit ""restart"" over and over until you get a good setup. BTW, each champion basically has one build route to go, there is almost zero player choice in the game, and even if there are maybe two or so build routes you can go, again, the game doesn't give you enough player freedom to actually manipulate your deck.

Original review: I have only stuck to the standard, single player games, with the exception of the occasional multi-player speed runs. I have to say this game is very fun, addictive, and well done in every aspect. If you are a fan of these type of turn based, roguelike climbers, then you will love this one. It seemed like an odd concept at first, playing the minions of Hell fighting against the forces of good, but I quickly became enamored with my little minions and all their oddities.

I'd put myself in the more casual camp of Slay the Spire (StS) players, so I was really surprised that I beat the final boss on just my 2nd run. I don't think I had one of those ""broken"" builds, but maybe I accidentally stumbled into one without realizing it. Monster Train feels more ""streamlined"" compared to StS. I'm sure the game gets more difficult as you go, and there are optional ways to increase the difficulty, but if you found yourself getting frustrated with StS but want something like it, pick this one up. And while it's 75% through November 29, it's a no-brainer - get this game!

My primary gripe at this very early point: The enemy noises on attack/hit are a little harsh and don't have a lot of variety, so it's kind of an unpleasant cacophony if there's lots of enemies you're tearing through, or fighting a boss that you slowly whittle down. It's just *SKWAK*SKREE*SKWAK*SKREE*SKWAK*SKREE*SKWAK*SKREE* until the boss is dead.

Replayability is a key part of any roguelike/roguelite, and I don't anticipate that being an issue - it seems you're incentivized to try and beat a run with all the possible combos of clans. The music is rad, art is great, and I appreciate that you can speed up the animations once you end your turn. I'm looking forward to seeing more of the cards, too - I can tell there's going to be tons of fun combos to discover.",1669182931,1669182931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a great game for casual players and I am relatively casual in my gaming.  It's pretty easy to get into the concept and what you start off with kind of sucks.  But that's the point of a roguelike.  As you go through you get more powerful and understand the synergies and strategies for different bosses become apparent.  It's quite short to make one run through... and maybe that's what bothers me.  

I don't really see a point in unlocking all the cards, all the covenants, all the things.  It's not new and fun anymore.  I mean, I get it, the covenants give you different ""penalties"" or things to potentially change your strategy, but you never really have to sweat it too much.  Maybe I just don't like going through the same 9 levels over and over again with no variety.  

I know I'm in the minority, but I just don't find the game fun anymore.  But I thought Slay the Spire was boring too so maybe I don't like card battlers.  Actually, maybe just roguelike card battlers.  I loved Epic of Gilgamech, and Griftlands but they're not really roguelikes (especially not Gilgamech).

The game - and this is probably why it is rated this high - is fun in the beginning, when you have stuff to explore and learn the ropes. After a few quick runs (and they are very quick!) a certain same-y-ness starts to sneak in.
There is little progression, little diversion, the game plays mostly the same, deck build almost entirely dependent on who you chose as your champion aka from the start on, because that's how the game works. There's little depth in all of this. The game itself is very easy in itself and (of course) gets progressively harder the more you turn up the extra difficulty (covenants), something which I've always hated - but that is just me.

It's a fine 6/10 for me, but after a few hours the fun curve significantly drops, and this game has neither depth nor content to really even tempt me to grind. I'd rather just start another slay the spire run.",1667749061,1667749061,False,10,2,0.590595901012420654,0,True,False,False

It is part deckbuilder, part tower defense, and part autobattler in various amounts. You play units onto a three-tiered train to hell which take turns attack enemies that enter from the bottom and try to destroy your pyre at the top. It is somewhat like Magic in the sense that you have permanent monsters and can use spells which are discarded when played. This style of gameplay gives the game a very unique feel and interesting play patterns I'm confident you won't get from other roguelite deckbuilders out there. You can't review a roguelite deckbuilder without mentioning Slay the Spire, so I won't try to avoid it. This game isn't balanced as well as StS, but it is very competent. Playing at very high challenge levels in the DLC makes some options in the game obsolete as they simply don't stack again the enemy scaling (Slay has this problem, just to a lesser degree) but if you are playing at that high of a difficulty, you won't have trouble spotting novel card choices/builds. I think the overall difficulty is less than StS as well, but the game features a covenant system similar to ascensions in StS and has additional challenge options and a new form of optional enemy scaling in the DLC (which is not necessary to get tens upon tens of hours out of the game). Overall, I think that Monster train is slightly easier game to get into without sacrificing the room to grow and improve that makes this genre so addicting. the TFT, Battlegrounds, or other autobattler inclined of you will enjoy the challenge of solving unit scaling which is a large part of what makes the gameplay feel so unique. Monster Train is one of the most fun and ""go again-able"" roguelite deckbuilders I have ever played, second only to the granddaddy of the genre itself.

I think the core issue is the same: the exponential ramp in enemy health means you're required to create a single super unit with a very particular strategy to win‚Äì especially at higher levels. The infrastructure with three floors and all these possible cards is pretty pointless. 

BUT, what this game excels at is variety. There are five base racials, ten heroes, and each hero has 3 build paths. Functionally, there are thirty different strategies give or take you can try out. In any given run, 50-90% of the cards are useless, but the specific cards you're using do change.

There's still a problem with about a quarter of the deck. When you need to deal 4k damage to the final boss, quite a few of the possibilities are simply useless and laughable. They literally serve no process outside of some early game fodder.

Overall, it's a unique defense based gameplay, a fun astethic, and the potential to have some fun and engaging gameplay, even if its often time a bit too luck based, praying that the right builds that you're commited to appear.

As a fan of the genre, I hope you'll appreciate the genius decisions made in this game as I do.

There are 6 different playable clans (1 from DLC) in the game and they are basically classes with their own themes and keyword mechanics, but there's a twist here already: you always play a combination of 2 clans, and each of them has 2 variations which add a few different cards to your base deck. One of the clans you choose will be your primary clan and with that comes an upgradable champion. Each champion is [b]completely unique[/b], including its upgrades, even when comparing the champions from the variations of the same clan.

Before a run even starts, you'll get a few more random cards added to your deck from the two clans you picked, complementing the clan cards from the variations you chose and the base minions that you always start with. Along with the starting upgrade you choose for your champion, you'll also get a free artifact and will be offered another reward but this one costs pact shards, a DLC mechanic that increases difficulty based on how many of these kind of rewards you take. So right off the bat you can already imagine the huge amount of possible combinations even before the first battle begins.

The amount of combinations is [b]really[/b] meaningful, making runs feel extremely different from one another, and of course it will only get more diverse as a run goes on. This game manages to actually translate the combinations into variety in gameplay, and there are two big factors that contribute to it: How the RNG is done, giving a lot of control to the player and the balanced viability of all game mechanics (and there are a lot of them).

Almost all cases of RNG will have the player pick from options, and even if you don't want any of the presented options, you'll still be compensated with gold, so even when you're unlucky you're still getting something back and this include events found on the map in between battles, which are mostly straight benefits and the ones that aren't that are challenges that reward you later for enduring them. But what's more special than using RNG well is choosing not to use it at times where normally it would be, and with great success, as variety is done through other means.

A form of control that tilts the RNG in a smart player's favor are the different upgrade systems. I've talked about the champion, but you can also upgrade cards (both minions and spells) and even your train after the mini bosses. The cards have two upgrade slots by default which can be filled by upgrades as simple as numeric changes and as complex as adding keyword mechanics, and you always choose where they go and how you stack them. There's even a brilliant purge mechanic that makes your card really strong the next time it is played and then remove it from the deck. The train upgrades can help accommodate different strategies by increasing the minion capacity on each floor, the amount of ember (your main resource to play cards) or the number of cards drawn each turn and there is much more depth to this than it seems.
 
I haven't mentioned yet how the battle is divided in 3 floors inside your train, and the enemies will start from the bottom and go their way up until they reach the 4th floor, where there's just your pyre to defend you, and if it's destroyed you lose. This 3-floor train layout allows for multiple layers of strategy for every deck and this goes really well with the preview feature that shows your enemies before every battle and even the mini bosses and last boss special ability right at the start of the run, so you can plan around that instead of being robbed of a win by being hard countered when you get to one of these encounters. You even have the option to give yourself a tougher challenge for great rewards during the preview screen every couple of battles.

In between battles, you'll interact with the world map by picking a path from two available options. Each path has 2-3 overworld entities (events) to interact with. Aside from merchants, none of them cost you any resources, making so that refining your deck is much easier to accomplish. One last important aspect of the world map is that there will always be 2 options and they always lead to the same next level. This map will generate really tough decisions because the options available in each path are all really valuable, but you must prioritize the essential ones for your strategy. To help even more with the planning you can see the entirety of the map from the get go, even before the first combat.

After playing with it, I can't help but compare Monster Train's world map to Slay the Spire's, which if I'm not wrong was the first world map with the branching paths but no real depth that was inspiration to many different games and most of these inspired implementations didn't change it at all as if it was an amazing mechanic. Don't get me wrong, it works just fine in StS but here there is a lot more thought that goes into every choice and the flexibility is much greater, allowing for multiple ways to strategize both short and long term. There's also the elegance of simplicity in two distinct paths but with much more depth instead of a tangle of branching paths that are either exactly the same or very close to each other like in these other games.

It's time to mention difficulty and how well it's implemented. The DLC is amazing regarding this, introducing the pact shards and a new final boss, which are both optional. Following that, there is the Covenant system, an option to increase the challenge unlocked after successfully completing a run. It has up to 25 cumulative ranks and each of them will increase the challenge by numeric values or interesting mechanics. But that's just the beginning, really. Having a fully unlocked 25th rank covenant means you can now add mutators to runs and do expert challenges. 

Mutators are modifiers to the run and they can be either beneficial or detrimental, changing the gameplay [b]drastically[/b]. The effects can alter starting options, grant buffs or debuffs to both allies and enemies, change the amount of resources gained, alter the way to modify your deck, add extra fun challenges only available in this mode and much more. The best thing is you can have up to 3 mutators turned on simultaneously. Building upon mutators, there are also expert challenges which are premade challenges consisting of specific combinations of mutators, which are extremely fun and they do a splendid job of highlighting how amazing mutators can be.

Last but not least, the multiplayer aspect of this game is done really well. You can build custom challenges and share with anyone, and they can be as restrictive as you want. You can also race your friends and compare wins using the leaderboards. There are also daily challenges and hell rush game modes so you can engage with a varied style right from the main menu. Speaking about the menu, the logbook is really complete and has an awesome collection of personal stats, along with your run history. And to top it all off it also has mod support.

I went into detail of a lot of mechanics not only for new players but also to highlight how much better this game can be at even the smallest things, and it all adds up. You can mix and match strategies every run into a unique and memorable one and the game never stops surprising me about how viable every different strategy can be, since it's not afraid of having a player become too powerful, which I love. I wholeheartedly think this is the best deckbuilding roguelike [b]by far[/b], as it builds spectacularly on concepts that worked really well and fixes many of the flaws that are present in similar games.",1657207351,1662731115,True,25,1,0.769469618797302246,0,True,False,False

The covenant system suck the fun out instead of presenting a new challenge. It's a good pickup if you aren't going to tackle that part of the game, but otherwise there's not much replayability to have.

To elaborate:
You start with a number of basic card based on the clan you pick, a number of universal basic units, and a set of random cards that consist of one rare card and several copies of the same more common cards. A large number of the covenant levels simply add more cards to one or more of the aforementioned pools. Extra starting card from main clan, extra starting card from secondary clan, etc. You get the gist. The deck become more than half-fold larger when the base deck is already quite thick.

That all compounded into an increasingly bloated starter deck, where a bad RNG (which will happen sooner or later) will screw you over. Need a unit to be meat shield? Have a hand full of spells. Need spell to snipe an important enemy backline? Get a full hand of units. Sometimes the RNG screwup happens before you even enter your first battle when the random set of cards are total garbage. Not exactly a rare happenings either.

This wouldn't even be as bad if the combat style isn't so heavily snowball-based. Every turn, all surviving enemy units climb one (or more) levels of your train and a new wave enters the lowest floor. At best, a terrible hand will lead to an extra wave of unmolested enemies you'll need to deal with at the next turn. At worst, those unmolested enemies will murder your defenders which means next turn not only you'll have to deal with more enemies, you also have less defenders to deal with them.

This lead to the sheer necessity to prioritize card remove over all else. Beeline to card removal event and spend all your money on card remove, because a bad hand early at most lead to some damage to the core but a bad hand mid-late in a run might as well end it then and there. You'll have to do all that while also try to scrounge for a late-game victory condition, which already depends on what the RNG gives you, even though you're seeing less options due to the necessity of taking the deck-thinning path.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]

Very gorgeous graphics. Most animations are top notch.


[h1] Sounds [/h1]

The music fits the ambience, it's a lot of action and voice sound effects, so it fits the genre of fighting. There is enough variation to not get the player bored of listening.


[h1] Gameplay[/h1]

It's great for passing up time. You will have a game where difficulty between learning how to play the combination of cards/factions and how to master them rise up nicely and can brake if you feel it's going too fast for you. The challenge modes spice things up and you can unlock golden border of cards, which is nice because it's a purely cosmetic reward which doesn't impact on anything if you don't care.

Each run feels different if you try to experiment with different cards and heroes. Even if you go for the exact same strategy, it STILL can feel different due to a lot of random rewards / choices you have to do along the way. The mini bosses are varied too and the final boss behaves differently each time you run against him, so the same strategy might not work all the time.

It have a unique layer of customization/strategy which is the floor you put your units or cast your spells. It's better if you spend your last 'mana' kill that soon to be attacking minion which barely escaped your monsters or it's better to buff your units on the front?

There is also plenty of achievements and challenges to complete if one is interested on it. And even a few secrets.


[h1] Story [/h1]

Story is encouraging. You are responsible for maintaining alive the last piece of hell and to rekindle it. It also explains why you run a lot of monsters in your train and why they all team together despite being different races. There is a lot of lore to chug if you take your time to read the story of each card while not in combat.


[h1] Bugs / Troubleshooting [/h1]

My notebook is an Acer VX 15.  It ran smoothly to me, no stuttering, nothing. I didn't notice any bugs.


[h1] Final Verdict  [/h1]

9.0 / 10

A great rogue like which successfully maintains the variation and the action pumping, not getting you bored if you are willing to try different things.

Some cards DO feel underpowered compared to others. Like for example, card that just move your allies on the floors and heal for the cost of [2].

+Beautiful and flashy animations on each card

-Roughly only 20-30 hours of game time. After that every faction/champ is unlocked, and you're just grinding for missing cards.
-Not really PvP
-Not actually a real deck builder game, you pick an general idea and stick with it, and add/upgrade cards after each fight.

Monsters always appear on the lowest floor, and ascend a floor when they survive your attacks. On the top floor there's a crystal that should be protected at all costs, so it's necessary that you beat all monsters before they reach that floor. This is done by playing cards, which spawn a creature on the floor of choice, or cast spells that can heal, apply buffs and debuffs etc. These mechanics work incredibly well, making Monster Train one of the most enjoying card battle games I've ever played.

The game contains 5 different decks, and you can combine two decks for each playthroughs. Each deck has a completely different playstyle, and also has two heroes to choose, who can be upgraded in several ways. To increase the replayability even more, you can switch to a higher covenant after beating the game, which adds extra challenges to your run. I have beaten the game with each faction for the first five covenants, but I'm sure I will do many more runs in the next few months. Oh and the game works great on the Steam Deck; just press a button when you see a black screen and change the video player in the settings screen.

Monster train does really well with providing player agency through multiple upgrade slots and always providing clear options in events. This often means that there are several viable paths to victory. And it definitely opens the door to building ridiculous combos than the more buttoned-up competitors.

Inevitably, this game gets compared to Slay the Spire. Both are great games. But StS is a tighter game that requires optimal decision-making at high ascensions (and luck helps).

As someone with over 200 hours in Slay the Spire, this game is aimed right at my demographic and can sit comfortably in my library alongside Ring of Pain, Dicey Dungeons, and Inscryption as secondary choices that I'll resort to when I get bored of StS.

It's not that I think MT is inferior to StS, it's just that  I've always been more a fan of combat in games being 70% standard enemies and 30% boss fights. I never got into boss rush games because the learning curve feels more jerky whereas having a bunch of smaller enemies in your game that teach the player individual mechanics that are then consolidated into a boss fight feels more natural and smooth to me.

If you like, take this as more of a review of boss rush games vs games with standard enemies, as I know that comes down entirely to preference. Some may enjoy the relatively streamlined approach of just tackling a boss fight over and over until you learn their patterns and weak spots. That said, I feel that kind of play works better in a game without random elements as my ability to win a run of MT seems to come down mostly to how early in the run I find the super tanky spiky plant man and the large gem that gives him an absurd amount of heath and attack. Randomness is obviously an integral part of deck builders but games like StS balance out that randomness by giving the player dozens of choices between boss fights and standard enemies that offer a chance to test your deck and fix your build as you go.

Train has 3 floors, and after each turn our monsters fight against enemies on the same floor. Then, enemies ascend, trying to reach a Pyre, which is mounted on the top of our wagon.

The base game contains five fractions, and in each run, we choose two of them - a main one and a support one. These fractions vary a lot - each one of them is based on another mechanic (even two mechanics, in fact), and these mechanics are really fun and original, different from what can be seen in other games. Thus, each run may be a totally new experience, when the player has to discover a way to win from the ground.

And this is a point that requires emphasizing: Monster Train is designed to discover. Not only it has many fractions, but it also rewards the player for discovering - the game contains a logbook that marks each fraction combination we have won with, and even each single card we have won with. And I had much from filling this logbook, the game strongly encourages players to do so, so they are not bored by playing the same optimal tactic again and again.

And here comes main disadvantage of Monster Train: although fractions and cards vary a lot, enemies are not that different. Yeah, some of them have some special traits, but most of them are not very surprising or don't make that big difference.  That's why choosing the best fractions and cards every time may become boring very quickly. Even though the game has 25 ascension levels, each of them making the run slightly harder. In other words, if you are 100% focused on playing the best tactic every time and you don't have fun from experimenting or taking suboptimal choices to fill the logbook, Monster Train may be not for you.

A small, but appreciated accent is that the game likes to give the player many statistics. After each run, it shows us some records we broke (and there are so many records that you will almost surely break some), and compares us to friends.

Summarizing, I had lots of fun from playing Monster Train and I really recommend this game. It brings some fresh ideas to deckbuilding genre, and it executes them very well.

It is finished product, the quality you get for the price is quite good and there are deckbuilding rogue elements in place. the reason people are buying this game for.. 

So what are the issues for me. Again I understand that this game is on its own but as it was inspired and grown on popularity of Slay the Spire I would compare those two.
The main problem I got while playing it for couple of hours that success in this game is just relying on big numbers of your units. More tanky units you have in frontline and more multi-damage units you have in backline more luckily you would be winning every run and this makes game a bit boring. There is no place to make interesting random builds based on situation or luck for certain scenario, there is very little or none chance to experiment as it is not rewarding at all but too risky instead and tbh you stick with one or two meta strategies that bring you easy wins what is just not fun in general. I can explain the A+ rate of the game in steam because it was made for casuals that don't wanna do heavy calculations and be destroyed by every other basic bandit gang on start of the game if unlucky like it was in Slay the Spire or win bosses with 1 life left while having meta build and best card drop ever on your last toss.. and the same I can tell about other game called Super Auto Pets what has more similar gameplay with Monster Train in part of battles but it feels so damn different. You never feel those adrenaline spikes and feeling of been smart and lucky at the same time by your last second decision of taking risk, changing unit or doing retoss of your deck and getting reward the unit or card you was in desperate need.. so you never would feel this in Monster Train. When Monster Train is more like walk in the park and not going through a storm.

The story is as simple as weird: Hell has frozen over and it is up to you to drive an Sbowpiercer-like train through the Nine Circles of Hell and deliver the spark that can rekindle the infernal fires. During this journey you will battle angels and priests that invade your train and try to reach the top of your train through 3 vertical levels and attack the heart. Should this 'Pyre' be destroyed, it's game over, so better prevent the heavenly hordes from doing this by summoning your own fiends and other monsters to battle them. So better start drawing those cards and flinging those spells because there is an netherworld to save.

'Choice' is one of the main keywords for this game, since a lot is offered to the player. Which clans shall I choose to play with, and then which or the unique gameplay mechanics of the chosen clan will I focus on in my run? What difficulty shall I choose, which starting artifacts and powers and which route should the train take to pickup new units and loot? The balance of all this so very well done: when you lose a run you can usually see where you made a strategic error; rarely did I had the feeling I was unjustly punished by the RNG gods.

Monster Train takes the now booming roguelike genre, into the card game genre. Others have done this before, like Slay the Spire, but what i like most about this game is how incredibly simple it is, but has massive depth as you earn new cards and clans. Like most card games, it looks super confusing because you dont know whats going on, but even after my first fight, i got the mechanics immediately and everything else followed close behind. Its just a really solid game, the 3 floors add depth that rewards planning ahead, the runs are fairly short but promotes multiple playthroughs with different clans. The mutators and covenants add some twists and turns. My only complaint is the lack of bosses. The final boss (if you dont buy the DLC) is always the same, same goes for the others minibosses. 

The last thing i will touch on is the only current DLC, The last Divinity. I looked up reviews and basically most if not all say it breaks the game. The new clan is neat, but the new additions to standard runs make the game very unenjoyable, compared to the base game anyways. I've opted to not buy it until i get bored or want more, but looking at gameplay it seems to be a little crappy.

You essentially get to pick two colors (clans) which offer different play styles, but I feel like there are only a few key win condition cards surrounded by mostly junk. It's usually quite easy to remove all the junk and duplicate the win condition cards. Then there is the ability to modify cards sometimes causing insane damage output or tanking defense making some runs just overly easy, broken and unbalanced. Occasionally you will get a run where those win condition cards aren't offered, but that is the nature of RNG.

This is that game for me.

I see the positive reviews and I wish it appealed to me.  I see people raving about how much fun overpowered combos are, but for me that is the opposite of fun - either not drawing useful things and struggling or breezing through without a challenge.

Every little thing here somehow manages to rub me exactly the wrong way.  I hate the three lane mechanic and I hate that enemies will automatically go up lanes.  I hate the stacking multiple units in each lane rather than having just one per.  I hate how after the last turn the battle just autoplays until it finishes.  I hate that there is a turn limit at all.  I hate the focus on upgrading cards to absurd degrees rather than outplaying enemies with your hand.  I hate the focus on having a single win condition that is the same for every fight.  Everything I enjoy about lane based card games (units that attack/defend different lanes, cross lane synergies, more lanes) this game just does not have.

I even hate the presentation.  I don't like the semi-animated units.  I find the music and sound effects grating enough that I turn them off.  I feel like the UI is terrible and busy.  I even dislike the artstyle for the enemies, which to me comes off as weirdly generic for something so fantastical.  The entire game would appeal to me more with just removing all the presentation work they did and putting actual cards down.

I was hoping for another Slay the Spire but this is its own thing.  The few times I have played feel much more akin to just pulling a lever on a slot machine - far more so than usual for a card game.  What I enjoy about card games is when they become a puzzle.  I like trying to think my way out of situations with what I have available to me, but this game has so far not given me even a single turn where I felt like there was a real ""choice"" about what cards I should be playing.  If I need to grind runs to get to that point, I am just not willing to.

I am glad other people enjoy this but it is astounding to me how much every aspect of this rubbed me the wrong way.  I wonder if the players that love this also enjoy auto battlers, because this game honestly reminds me of them.

(Blocks first hit, then enemies jump to the top.) Sometimes this is part of the risk/reward patterning of taking certain boons for more difficulty, but it's sudden and not gradual. The game seems to generate enemies based on your deck, for example the Stygian is based on spellcasting, but the enemies will generate with spellshields in response.

I'll probably keep playing because it tickles part of the brain that likes making creatures that feel broken, but ultimately the game doesn't deliver enough, tends to be very unrewarding and has a lot of poor design patterns. It lacks the variety of options when you strip away the facade that enemies are ""random"". You boil each faction down to a couple strategies and there's not much else. Create large creatures that can sweep all the enemies at once. Each faction just does that different.

the music & aesthetics don't totally do it for me personally but they're cleanly produced and competent. i like the character art design and lore (there's a lot if you seek it out). i would probably recommend starting with StS first because it's so damn good and incredibly balanced, and I think Monster Train moves logically forward from the roguelite deckbuilder prototype it created, but you pretty much can't go wrong with this game. also appreciate that the covenant/ascension system is less grindy than the former.",1653597320,1655737153,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Naturally, all these pretenders have failed. Along comes Monster Train by Shiny Shoe and suddenly, everything changed. 


Whilst on the surface Monster Train could be mistaken for a slay-the-spire-like, that initial belief and dismissal would result in you missing out on the best Roguelike to come out all year, and the best Deck Building in the last four. Monster Train can be summed up almost entirely by its title ‚Äì you are in control of a train, and it has monsters. Narrative ‚Äúdepth‚Äù comes from where the train is going, and who is assailing your demonic locomotive. Spoiler, it‚Äôs Hell, and they are Angels. 

Little to no time is spent on the story in Monster Train, and as is the genre staple, it is simply a means to an end. A backdrop to give the game a bit of thematic flair. Angels, demons, monsters, sentient wax people, and trains ‚Äì it all makes for quite the setting, even if it‚Äôs all surface level. Thankfully, Monster Train is much more than its fancy setting and steam-powered chugging.

Gameplay in Monster Train has you doing, as a general rule, two things. You are either picking where you are going on the bilinear map screen and engaging in whatever your path chooses OR, you are engaged in battle with the forces of Heaven. That‚Äôs it, but that ‚ÄúIT‚Äù is very compelling.   

Overall, Monster Train is outstanding. The few issues I have with it are minor at best, and what the game delivers shines through with ease. This is not only the best Roguelike I‚Äôve played all year, but quite possibly the best game. Period. It‚Äôs taken four long years for the genre to move beyond Spire, and Monster Train manages to stand beside that titan and carve its own path to greatness.

The thumbs down is very much in this context. I won't expound on what's good with the game because there's a lot of it and other reviewers have done that well already. But the key things I didn't like are:

1) The repetitiveness of the runs make this quickly feel like a chore. There are 9 battles in a run, and it's always the same battles with the same enemies in the same order every run, with only minor variations of the bosses. This removes a lot of the feeling of exploration and mystery of other roguelites.

2) The colours, special effects, and sound is all over the top; a kaleidoscope for every sense simultaneously. It's like if Michael Bay directed an anime. Not only was that distracting and overwhelming, making it hard to actually figure out whats happening in a turn, it also quickly gave me a headache.

3) There's a lot of feature bloat. Every playable clan has a slew of new mechanics which comes with their own counter that keeps track of a one-use quantity that stacks up for every unit. This gives it some replayability, but at a huge cost to cohesion as very few of these mechanics affect each other. Strategy comes from having a few simple elements that interact in uncountably many ways. Monster Train is often the opposite; like 8 different card games randomly mashed together.

That said, it's one of these games I might come back to for a game now and then. It's worth a few hours of game play for those really into deck-building rogelites, but I'd recommend playing Slay The Spire, Inscryption, and Griftlands first as I found those significantly better games in that genre in every regard.",1654183665,1655032126,False,2,1,0.44094887375831604,0,True,False,False

Both versions I'm still happily playing; I got the Switch version first (on day 1) and later on I knew I had to double-dip for the Steam version as well.

Both Monster Train and Slay the Spire stand out as two of my favourite roguelite/card battlers out there. But if I honestly had to choose which one's better, I guess Monster Train takes my pick. Slay the Spire set a gold standard for the genre of roguelite card battling as a whole, but to me, Monster Train takes what made Slay the Spire so successful and improves on them in more ways than one, also adding its unique twist to the proceedings (tower defence).

So what improvements? The main one to note is greater flexibility on deckbuilding; each battle victory rewards you with two card drafts (instead of one in StS), options to remove cards are cheaper and more frequent, and upgrading cards (both units and spells) are not limited to a specific upgrade path; so you could choose to upgrade a unit card with increased HP and Damage Shield, or perhaps Quick and Multistrike, whatever you choose is entirely down to you.
Granted what I just mentioned may regard this game as 'not challenging enough' or 'almost mindless' to some, however this point alone is what encourages to keep me coming back for more. I like having runs where I'm already planning out an exciting deck build from the get-go (especially with 5 random cards that are given to you if playing on (difficulty) Covenant 1 onwards), compared to say Slay the Spire (more often than not) that starts you with just your basic deck and nothing else, leaving me in limbo for some time and trying to plan a strategy from there. It's almost as if Monster Train hands you a canvas, paints and paintbrushes, instantly getting your creative juices flowing to paint a most depressed Seraph (?) you can come up with.

Other positives include its art style (might look strange at first, but it'll grow on you), its soundtrack, its lore (every single card and artifact has its own lore paragraph), and additional 'main characters' known as champions (10 in total, plus 2 exclusive to DLC), noting especially the MVP [spoiler]Little Fade[/spoiler], because why not.

Overall, this isn't a review to say that Slay the Spire is bad in any way (on Switch alone, I've spent at least 1,100 hours on it) and I still play that game often. However though, Monster Train for me stands out just that bit more in quite a number of ways for the reasons I've mentioned. I still love Slay the Spire which continues to set the gold standard to this day, but perhaps now Monster Train is my platinum standard?

In Slay the Spire it seems that most of the insane difficulty stems from getting shafted by bad luck. Whereas with this game, all event drops, upgrades, and card combos can be much better optimized.

The deck combos are a bit simpler but the gameplay is extremely fun and engaging thanks to the multi-level combat and that when you first start off, you're always making progress and unlocks, even with defeats.

It offers a tower defense mentality along with the random nature of scraping together a collection of synergistic cards. You select 2 different factions which provide variety in strategy and style of play. The way shops allow you to buy modifications for each monster or spell in your deck is a delight, and seeing your desired upgrade in a shop is a rush every time. I like the way the map works, because instead of choosing every single stop along the path, you're choosing packages of locations on one fork or the other. It makes you weigh exactly what you want against what you need in more categories at once. As you start to identify your play style, you can add optional challenges and compare your successes to your Friends List.

It's extremely addictive at first, with you racing to unlock all the factions and then all of their cards and relics. The game starts to struggle once you've played that far, as an awful lot of the cards feel too niche or the faction mechanics are overly specific and unreliable. When you start to realize what works best, it's often the more simple and trustworthy cards you'll gravitate to over and over to see further successes. (Especially when the ""covenant"" bonus challenges stack up against you.) It's also disappointing that the bosses are always the same each run, with only small mutators to twist exactly what precise strategy is ideal.

I prefer Slay the Spire's depth, Trials of Fire's variety, and Griftland's narrative. I still recommend Monster Train, however, because it still does plenty that feels different and I could see it appealing more than those games to the right person. I was completely addicted to it for a good 20 hours before I started to slow down, and that means it's a good game even if it isn't a new lifelong friend.

It plays great on Steam Deck. At the time of this review, the intro video doesn't load, but it's nonessential, and likely to be fixed in the future.",1654679266,1654679522,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a ton of variation both within each faction's cards/units and in the combinations of such, even more variation in the (well-balanced) events and artifacts which are thrown up along your run, and the card upgrades you're offered - and even more variation in the combat system, which is inherently much deeper than the typical slay the spire setup a lot of these games have. 

I'm highlighting opportunities for variation, because that's what will make it worth coming back for run after run after run. You have many chances to try different strategies, and you WILL get the chance to try them because you have much greater control over how the gameplan of each run develops. You're almost always presented with multiple choices whenever you get new cards/artifacts/upgrades, and unlike many other games your runs will essentially never depend on specific high-rarity enabler cards to come together. 

The design of most factions and their mechanics is cunning enough to have them be viable in different strategies for completely different reasons, which makes it feel more like you're actually discovering archetypes and putting them together yourself versus following one of a few preset lanes. Unlocking more cards and seeing more of the rare events and archetypes over time keeps things fresh, as do the various challenge modes. Even having gone out of my way to try all the options the game has to offer, I find myself still as engaged at the end as I was at the start, as I'm able to enable challenge run modifiers which make things harder in interesting, beatable ways.

All the small bits of polish here help as well - the lore and aesthetics of the game, while not front and centre, are actually quite compelling. The UI is very readable, and the thoroughness and completeness of tooltips means I never feel lied to about what's happening in combat. Even complex interactions resolve along logical and consistent lines, and the designers have been quite open minded in how cards and upgrades can be used, so you never feel like your cool ideas have been shut down. The logbook makes it easy to keep your progress through the game tracked for when you get to the completionist phase of play. 

I can't speak to the quality of the expansion, but the base game is a 10/10 for me and my only complaint is that other deckbuilders look worse by comparison. Please make more games like this.",1654668369,1654668369,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You carry with you the last flame of hell on a train. You need to protect it while the good guys want to take it from you and kill you and your monsters. It's a strategy deck building game with random elements and card drops so each run is different. A run typically takes about 30 minutes so it's easy to play and if you need to leave the game automatically saves your progress so you can continue where you were without much issues.

[H1]The good[/H1]
It's colourful, the level design is great and the music is cool. It's super addictive as there is so much to unlock and then new mechanics are introduced after you progress making the game a little bit more complex but still rewarding. There are different races and you can combine them to make your ultimate deck. 
If that is not enough there are daily challenges and you can compete with others or try a custom challenge. You can also make your own challenges by adding mutators to runs.
I also enjoyed that there are multiple events that usually give you a nice reward. There are even some secrets to be found.

[H1]The not so good[/H1]
It's super addictive :-) you will end up spending hours on perfecting your run. Then you discover multiplayer and daily competitions and you can't stop playing :-)
As you progress in the game it feels the solution to a run, narrows down to a few units or combinations. If you have an unlucky hand, you will lose and have to restart; at times this can be a little frustrating. On the other hand, you will learn strategies as to remove cards you don‚Äôt need and not to pick all the cards that are being offered. This ensures your more desirable cards show up more often.

[H1]Summary[/H1]
It's a great rogue-lite deck building game. You become more efficient as you discover what combinations work well. The music is great and adds a lot to the game. Graphics are OK. The game is optimized for small 30 minutes runs. Highly recommend if you want to play in short runs (although admittingly I played for hours just to find the right solution üòä).",1654646784,1654646784,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main thing that sticks out to me is how much influence you as a player have on your experience.  Although it's a rogue-like, you can decide to have the game automatically up the difficulty for you each win, or you can stick with the rank 1 difficulty and have fun unlocking new cards all the same.  Player choice is a core philosophy of this game's design and it shows.

Each run is made of two clans and it's a joy to unlock new cards and experiment with mad scientist brews. There's a constant unlocking of new cards and clans which keeps it fresh. There is some RNG, but there are so many countless winnable strategies that the game is more about tailoring choices to your ongoing strategy rather than hoping you find an OP artifact.

Compared to Slay the Spire, Monster Train is more forgiving.  If you're looking for a challenge though, the game can be set to up the difficulty with each win.  The higher levels of Covenant difficult require absolute mastery of card knowledge and a little bit of luck.

Just to summarize how dumb this game is, instead of actually playing it and having fun mixing decks..your best bet is to keep running the same strategy over and over until you max everything and unlock covenant 25. Shouldnt be like this.

Reasons: 
TL;DR All in all it feels kind of unfinished and didn't get me in the first 20 minutes because of missing depth.

All in all (Story, Monsters, Cards, Atmosphere) don't feel as dense. It kind of feels like a lot of depth is missing. It definitely lost me in the first 20 minutes.
The UI and the graphics are kind of basic and too simple (Should have checked more videos before buying it). UX wise: buttons and elements are not in regions where I would expect them, which gives me a feel of: yeah if I play it I will get used to it after an hour or two (same goes for the graphics and such). But I don't want to have to get used to something after hour(s), I want it to click immediately (at least for 85% of the game or so and definitely in the first 20 Minutes).

Slay the spire is probably the best roguelike deck builder I've ever played, and one of the best card games I've played as well. I can honestly say that Monster Train is probably even slightly [b] better [/b] than Slay the Spire (at least in my opinion). 

[b]The best comparison I can give is that Slay the Spire is a card game with strategy, while Monster Train is a strategy game with cards. What I mean by this is that  cards are simply used to convey what you can and cannot do, but the ultimate deciding factor is still up to you. In Slay the Spire when you play a card, thats the end of it. But in Monster Train you get to decide which lane to play the card, which lane to place your monsters, the order to place them, and possible synergies between them, this in itself adds many layers of depth not present in Slay the Spire.[/b]

I played Slay the Spire quite a bit and really enjoy the variety this game has to offer. 
There are completely different mechanics, like the 3-floor-design.  The different classes and therefore play-styles are also very entertaining. I'm very stoked to discover more of the game, since 4 hours are nothing for how much content there is.

If you liked Slay the Spire I can recommend the game 100%.
But also for everybody new to deckbuilding-roguelikes, this game is a must-try. If you don't enjoy the first 2-3 runs, just refund it.

Five clan (or 6 with the DLC), each uniquely different. Each has 2 champions, 9 units, and numerous spells. Each champion has 3 skills, each can be upgraded to level 3. But you only get 3 skillpoints per run so you have to decide how to distribute those skills. Units and spells have 2 upgrade spots with numerous options. Each run consists of 1 main clan (with a hero) and 1 support clan (no hero). Once you have beaten the game, the cards that you used will get special borders. So now, I run the game on random and lean toward cards that haven't earn the border. This forces me to change strategy to accommodate those cards.

Then along came a Monster Train and in my opinion, finally dethroned Slay the Spire as the king of this weird and addictive game type. 

For those not in the know, the game mechanics are as follows:

Each run you choose two factions. You are then put on your monster train where you need to fight multiple battles to reach the end. Each confrontation sees the player vying for control of the three floors on your train. On the left are where you will play monster cards to populate the floors and fight, and on the right the computer will be doing the same. The final, 4th level has the heart of your train and if its health reaches zero it's game over. 

Sounds simple right? Your monsters fight whatever enemy monsters have been played on the same level. Any surviving enemies after that battle move up a floor so you generally try to defeat them before they reach the trains heart. 

Now here's where it gets more complicated (and fun): You also have spells that can influence your monsters, the enemies, or the way the round plays out by altering some of the basic mechanics and defaults (such as increasing the max amount of space on a floor so you can stuff more monsters on it). Each faction is very different too and after some successful runs you'll start to unlock extra goodies for each faction such as more cards and artefacts (which have a global influence on your runs). 

Like Slay the Spire you can also upgrade your cards or alternatively, get rid of cards that aren't working for you. 

But here is the big biggy; because the game forces you to choose two factions for each run, unlike Slay the Spire you now have an entirely new angle to think about in this game: Combing certain deck types and focusing on certain types of cards within those decks to create unique strategies. Really, the list of what you can pull off is extensive to the point that you'll be returning to this game ever so often with a new idea in mind. 

When that gets boring you can up the difficulty of your runs for even more unique unlocks and rewards and then there is multiplayer where you can speed run against other opponents or just take it slow and see (point wise) how you did in comparison to others. 

There is workshop support but it isn't nearly as extensive as Slay the Spires which has an insane library of mods. I suspect the biggest reason is takes far more work to mode in these cards with all their unique animations than the rather simple look Slay the Spire went for. As far as I know there is only one workshop faction that has a good user rating, and not ironically, it's from a user who made a lot of stuff for Slay the Spire. 

Anyways, this game is crazy addictive and fun; I haven't touched the DLC yet as I am still working through the main games content, but if you check the reviews they do not seem very favourable.  The base game though? Fantastic stuff.",1651154951,1651154951,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. There are very few units in the game
2. Many clan combinations don't synergize at all, and the rest are weakly synergized. The second clan often feels like they exist just to add dead cards to your deck. It is a VERY bad system if you consider that there are 20 clan combinations but it feels like you're playing 5 clans alone with different dead cards sprinkled on top.
3. There are very few opportunities to add units to your deck - in fact you can just randomly not get the unit as a choice during the first few fights.
4. Even in individual clans, the archetypes are very disjointed and don't synergize well with themselves.
5. It doesn't feel very much like a deckbuilding game: few opportunities to tweak your deck, few cards, some determinism in the draw pattern, lack of mid range cards that help pad out the randomness, fixed number of turns you can draw cards before the boss fight.
Overall it's a 6/10. It's playable but it doesn't have any depth to it.",1650509046,1650509046,False,2,0,0.420376569032669067,0,True,False,False

I would say this game has more depth than Slay the Spire, and the variety is much more on the player side rather than the enemy side. The base game comes with 5 factions that each have 2 ""champion"" characters so basically like 10 heroes from StS. Each faction has its own unique gameplay mechanics that make it fresh, and they are all quite fun to learn and play. A few are SUPER OP but all can be made to work fairly easily.

The combat plays a bit more like a tower defense game with your 3-level train housing all of the battles, and you needing to stop enemies from reaching the top. This allows for countless different strategies depending on where you place your monsters, cast your spells etc. I didn't buy or play the expansion DLCs since I felt like it just wasn't needed, the game has plenty of content on its own. There's also Daily Challenges with random mutators and Custom Challenges made by the community. These have an interesting soft PvP element where you can see the position and score of others who are doing the same challenge at the same time, but it can be easily ignored if you're not interested.

Overall a great game that's worth full price if you love deck building games, but even if not I would still give it a go on sale.",1650465495,1650465495,True,0,0,0.487606674432754517,0,True,False,False

Monster Train has built on top of the already brilliant game that we all know STS is, and just makes it so much better in my opinion. If you haven't played Slay the Spire or any deck-builder style games I recommend you go play that game first, unless you don't mind the extra learning curve. 

2 main reasons I currently dont want to go back to STS currently:

 1: I love the blending of 2 factions to create your Monsters for each run. Every game feels incredibly different just based on the 2 different faction combinations you choose to play with. PLUS, each faction has 2 different champions and 2 different starter cards you need to choose from (So you will be choosing 1 of 4 champions/starter cards). All of this on top the variable nature of the game itself, and i've only played 4 of the 6 factions in the game after almost 50 hours of gameplay...

2: The other main reason I love this game over STS is the 3 added floors that you will be playing your units onto. After battling at the end of your turns, the enemy units will be moving up the floors of your train until it gets to your 'pyre' which is basically the life of your train. If the enemy units deplete all of your pyre's hit points you will lose. So its important that you plan carefully and the order in which you place your units in this game matters. It basically feels like you are playing an added puzzle on top of also trying to synergize the correct combination of cards to make it all work. I love this addition and is the main reason I want to keep playing this game.

Too long, or didn't read: Such an incredible and variable game. But also has a pretty steep learning curve especially if you haven't played Slay the Spire. If you are new to the genre go play that first, but I do enjoy this game much more.",1647823590,1647823590,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, it's also a game where you're likely to get (close) to the final boss on your very first run of the game, if not beat it straight up. MT relies heavily on NG+ & a player driven desire for variety rather than between-run power creep to keep you interested - And it worked! Well, until I got to NG+8 or so. At that point I was failing to gain any satisfaction from runs & stopped playing the game, despite enjoying it overall.

It's a weird one: I can definitely see some reasons why it's a better system than other rogue-likes where you're not expected to beat the game until you have a decent amount of between-run power gained, but it can also feel a bit anti-climatic climbing up the ranks until you reach a point of genuine challenge.

I guess I'll start off with this game is a 10 out of 10 hands down.  If you like Slay the Spire, you will love this too.

I'm normally not a person to say get the DLC immediately, but with this game, the expansion really makes this game unbeatable in terms of quality for how much you spend on it.

This game is punishingly hard if the deeper you get into it.  Want a bigger challenge?  Take on more pact shards.  I've read reviews that this game is too easy, well if you're playing on Covenant 0, yeah it's really easy.  When you play on 25, oh man can it get hairy fast.

This game makes me so mad.  This game makes me pump my fist when I win.  When a game can make you feel accomplishment, it's great.

I think I can summarize my praise for it by saying I've done more runs than I can count, and every run felt like an exciting story to tell. Every run has felt unique in some way that I want to share with my friends -- whether because I got an early Minor Refraction and was able to duplicate up a miniature army of demons or showing off a battle where I got exactly the right draws to load up Primordium with every kind of buff. Every run so far has managed to felt interesting and different in some crucial way: The perfect artifact early in the run or the keystone unit for defeating Seraph acquired right before confronting him. There hasn't been a run yet where I haven't felt compelled to take a few screenshots to remind myself of my build and the final composition of my units before landing the killing blow on Seraph. 

On that note, the UI is also extremely good, with everything you need to understand the run (artifacts, pyre health, covenant rank, mutators, etc.) present at all times. It's really clever: it's both useful to the player to make all that information constantly available, but also makes screenshots/streaming extremely informative. Every picture tells a story.

It certainly has enough originality to set it apart from the tide of games that have entered the market following the success of Slay the Spire. 

It's also a generous spirit. You will win a greater proportion of your runs in Monster Train than you will in Slay the Spire, but you will also find more varied playstyles between runs and a fewer 'dud' runs where nothing comes together soon enough to get a good run going. That's not to say that Monster Train is an easy game. It may give you more ways to succeed and break the game, but it will demand that maximise these opportunities and test your ability to react to unexpected challenges on the rails.

The length of the core gameplay loop is frustrating - too long to be popcornable, too short to really get invested in the deck you're building before it's all over.  And ultimately there is just a crunchiness and johnny-like combo satisfaction to other deck battler games once you get your deck humming that seems to be missing here.  In most runs you're going to get a couple of 'combo pieces' (aka op cards that are even more op together, nothing actually clever about it), then spend the rest of your gold upgrading those cards and burning the rest of your deck so you can draw and play your key pieces consistently every turn for the rest of the game.

Graphics are good and music is fitting as well.

Pros:
good graphics
nice atmosphere and music
decent decks and different too
Some options to build your deck
replayability

Cons:
- Several if not many cards seem useless
- Quick play through (some might consider a plus) but it becomes very repetetive
- I'd say it needs at least 2 more rounds and also alternative bosses when playing through - it is always nearly the same just the bosses tweak their abilities slightly
- Some cards have absolutely no value and even the choices each sub stage to build your deck are meh, there is often just one way making it the clear choice
- Watching your units fight a boss with 3k life punch for punch for punch for punch for punch... even on high speed does not make fun. You are actively just putting in a couple of cards each round, rest is automated
- not enough enemy untis to spice things up

So I do think Monster Train is a good rogue-like card deck builder, very similar to Slay The Spire. However, I would put it just a bit below Slay the Spire. The reason for that is that this game is just slower (at least for me). Generally, especially if you're new to the genre, there's just a lot of reading carefully involved to learn all the card effects. Also, what you play, while important, doesn't seem to be as important as deciding what gets put into your deck and what you can take out.

So you may have already lost a battle before even starting it. So a decision you made much earlier to create synergy within your deck, may have a hard counter at one of the random fights up to the boss. I ran into several such fights and only learned from running into those buzzsaws to be ready for these hard counters. Unfortunately, this makes you min / max everything and not get very creative with your deck building.

The pacing is just slow as well. Sometimes you have a lot of cards in your hand to play and where you will place your cards on the train is very important and requires much thought. Especially at the higher convenant (after beating the boss you can go for higher challenges), it seems to be very RNG dependent. You will get more random cards and sometimes they just don't have any synergy. Also, some cards and some artifacts are just overpowered that they make those games much easier than your other ones. I had one artifact at the beginning that made all my Stewards (starting pawn cards) just overpowered and the whole game was a breeze from the start. And then I had another one where I got the artifact late in the game, where I had already gotten rid of all my Stewards.

I had more fun with Slay the Spire. The pacing was just a lot better. I also had a lot more fun with Inscryption and Ring of Pain. This is not a bad card game. In fact, I think it's good and a bit addicting (I think I'm going cold Turkey though). It's just not among the best of this genre IMHO. Obviously though, it's rated overwhelmingly positive by Steam reviewers so I imagine there is disagreement on that conclusion.

You can theoretically ""Beat"" this game in as short as 3 hours. But the fun of a deck-building game like this is experimentation.

I spent countless hours in this game just paring different demons, spells, races, and countless other techs in the game together. You lose yourself in the multitude of options you have presented and find yourself having a unique experience because of it.

Some may focus on debuffs, others may focus on wrecking angels with pure damage focus build. The best feeling that this game conveys is that all options are valid. Sure, some builds/techniques definitely work much better than others, but the feeling of being screwed by your build feels next to non-existent.

The core game-loop is amazing if you're looking to lose yourself in building the best deck possible. this is the game for you. Especially at its low price point on sale. (I think I paid like 12 bucks, but the full price is more than worth how much content you receive in the game)

is the most apt one-line summary for Monster Train.

Mind you, the game does more than just copy the 'default hallmark for card-based combat rougelikes', as it offers you more setup choices (5 + 1 DLC 'color', combining two colors per run to form a unique choice of possible card combinations), simplifies the 'travel along routes gathering gimmicks in between combat' concept to it's core, and then adds in a multi-layered combat revolving not around a single character, but an army of card-summoned minions.

In many ways, Monster Train succeeds in removing filler and condensing down the gameplay to it's core elements, whilst not becoming too simplistic. However, it also means that 30 minutes per completed run isn't a 'speedrun', but the slow norm. It's very much a 'do a quick run in a break/lull' kind of game.

The major gripe I can find with this, is that the game balance is not as ripe as that of Slay the Spire: Whereas in the latter, you are expected to fail several times till you learn how to build a good deck to then maybe beat the tough bosses with, in Monster Train you can essentially build any kind of deck that has a strong combo/synergy, and then just need to execute that combo in each of the up to 9 combats, and that's about it. And it [i]is[/i] remarkably easy to build [i]insanely[/i] powerful combos. Sure, you can scale up the difficulty on later runs, but I think that both the entry level and the scaling of the difficulty is just way too lax for the insane combos the game makes available.

Another, lesser, issue, is the enemy diversity. Sure, there's a couple few with fancy special effects... but none which force you to truly change your strategy or approach. It's always 'wave of mooks', sometimes with offense-focus, sometimes with a defensive one, sometimes they skip a floor or have effects that trigger on death. There's no striking, powerful mechanical oddifties that force you to rethink your approach, and even the main bosses don't quite get there.


Overall, the game is nonetheless well-made, has solid production value (I particularly love the fact every single card is animated), and is a great provider of brief sessions of casual deck-building fun.

If you like deck-building games, you probably want to give this a try, and twice so if you want to get into the genre, but always figured the games are too hard to figure out.

So I do think Monster Train is a good rogue-like card deck builder, very similar to Slay The Spire. However, I would put it just a bit below Slay the Spire. The reason for that is that this game is just slower (at least for me). Generally, especially if you're new to the genre, there's just a lot of reading carefully involved to learn all the card effects. Also, what you play, while important, doesn't seem to be as important as deciding what gets put into your deck and what you can take out.

So you may have already lost a battle before even starting it. So a decision you made much earlier to create synergy within your deck, may have a hard counter at one of the random fights up to the boss. I ran into several such fights and only learned from running into those buzzsaws to be ready for these hard counters. Unfortunately, this makes you min / max everything and not get very creative with your deck building. 

The pacing is just slow as well. Sometimes you have a lot of cards in your hand to play and where you will place your cards on the train is very important and requires much thought. Especially at the higher convenant (after beating the boss you can go for higher challenges), it seems to be very RNG dependent. You will get more random cards and sometimes they just don't have any synergy. Also, some cards and some artifacts are just overpowered that they make those games much easier than your other ones. I had one artifact at the beginning that made all  my Stewards (starting pawn cards) just overpowered and the whole game was a breeze from the start. And then I had another one where I got the artifact late in the game, where I had already gotten rid of all my Stewards.

I had more fun with Slay the Spire. The pacing was just a lot better. I also had a lot more fun with Inscryption and Ring of Pain. This is not a bad card game. In fact, I think it's good and a bit addicting (I think I'm going cold Turkey though). It's just not among the best of this genre IMHO. Obviously though, it's rated overwhelmingly positive by Steam reviewers so I imagine there is disagreement on that conclusion.

The amount of replayability this game offers with 5 Clans (or 6 with DLC), each with 2 Different starting decks and acording champion units and the fact that you combine 2 of these as primary and secondary clans ultimatly giving you 120 options. If this doesn't convince you yet, the gameplay is just fun. Wether you get one BigG unit or spells that deal a billion damge (not litteraly) is really satisfying, compared to another great Roguelite Deckbuilder, Slay the Spire, where you gradually get stronger, Monster train gives you these powerspikes where your run can suddenly become utterly broken.
If after all of this you are still not sure let me give you a very special quote from the game:

Compared to Slay the Spire, This game is SUPER EASY and the runs are short.
Spike is ULTRA BROKEN (Deal damage when being attacked) can be stacked ultra high in this game since the begin you could easily stack 10+ by using plant cards you could gain 3 Spike that will never wore out VS Slay the Spire there Spike is very scarce i.e.Only available by artifacts (Limited to only 3 damage) or flame barrier (Started at 4 damage with high paywall of 2 energy and ran out in one turn).
There will be a unit that gain permanent spike +3 by getting healed. 
It took 20 gold to increase units HP when you found it in your path and that means you could easily make an ULTRA broken spike wall with 100HP+.
Set the spike and armor aside, Every cards in the game could be upgrade to not use any energy. -1 Energy with just 20 gold. Given that you found the upgrade shop in your path (Pretty easy to find one).
And there is a spell card that can do 100 damage to all units (Include friendly units). So when you upgrade this card to never use energy, you get the most broken spell in the game because most enemy has like 80HP maximum. And you could even upgrade it to turn back to your hand.

This is a deckbuilding game that is also pseudo-tower defense (in that  you place your units on various levels of a train and they fight units as they go up) with auto-battle elements added in. The game is great for two major reasons:

1) Customization. As you progress you get spells and units, then you can augment these units at the various shops, by default you can enhance cards twice, but it can be increased. You also get to pick two factions to only get cards from those two factions, so you could for example go Melting Remnants with Awoken, Melting Remnants focuses on reviving dead units and Awoken is very durable allowing you to have a strong tank while throwing units at enemies and reviving them even stronger.

2) Controlled RNG. There are so many elements in your control that losing a run is really on you 95% of the time - I say this losing plenty because I dink around with cards and make enemies stronger at the same time - But it's enjoyable to do so sometimes just to watch a unit hit 8 times and return to the top of your deck when it dies.

I think it is as good or better than Slay the Spire, but not nearly as good as Tainted Grail.  My two major complaints that make it a Not Recommend:

1) You can't bypass Covenant ranks, so if you want to try to ""beat"" the game (eg. Covenant 25) you have to grind out 25 wins.  This is extremely tedious, especially taking into account if you want to have the best chance of winning its just sticking to mostly the same builds.  You should have the option to just select whatever Rank you want.

2) Bit too much RNG.  Seems about 1/3 of the runs I'll get lucky and it will be trivially easy (but still time consuming), another 1/3 are challenging and require some good decision making, and another 1/3 are basically unwinnable, all due to RNG.  The kicker is you can fairly reliably guage how well the run is going to go just based off the artifact, extra cards, and possibly champion options you get at the very beginning.  The ""best"" strategy is just to immediately quit and restart the run a few times until you get something really good.",1641751901,1641751901,False,7,0,0.543182611465454102,0,True,False,False

I'm not gonna mention how much variation this game gives you each run, with 5 unique factions, each with  2 unique heroes to chose from and you always bring 2 factions each run with a mixed deck/cards every time.

And i'm not even gonna bore you with how damn addictive this game can be, with that good ""just one more run before bed"" feel.

The different combinations of Clans (Team/Faction) and Champions (Hero unit) offer a vast variety of build possibilites.

However, the game has a major fundamental flaw, each battle ends with a boss entering the board/battle field. After which, the game is an autobattler, no more taking turns (Though you do get use cards if the boss wipes you and moves up a floor), your units trade blows with the boss until either side dies. 
So builds that rely on usings spells or other strategies, while certainly being ""viable"" are a lot more clunky to play.

There's even a final boss which permanently (for the battle, but it is the last battle) removes the first spell you use each turn from your deck, leading you to unavoidably running out of spells, and having to rely on your minions to hold their ground.
The new DLC final boss, is also a build blocker. It will clear any debuffs after every turn, so builds that rely on stacking damage over time, or other status debuffs will struggle a lot.

So in my experience, builds that rely on building huge strong units are ultimately a lot more strong and easy to win with. Building up an imprenatable tank with damage dealing units behind, is a massively favored strategy. It also the type of strategy I enjoy the most, so good on that, but still unfortunate.

But despite the ""flaw"", the game is great fun. If there ever is a Monster Train 2, I'd be lining up to play it.",1626065215,1641315813,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

It nicely combines the deckbuilding aspect with strategic elements of unit positioning and synergies (similar to Darkest Dungeon, but on three levels). Your overall goal is to avoid that enemy units move to the top floor, where your pyre rests. Once its destroyed, you're dead.

The replayability is huge, since there are different clans (i.e., card decks). The clans play very differently due to different card mechanics. Furthermore, you not only select one clan but two for each run. This increases the combinations further. And there are ascencions, steadily increasing the difficulty after each successful run. The difficulty is pretty challenging once you reach a certain ascencion level. Similar to other deckbuilders, it's very satisfying to find a powerful deck, but it can be a bit tiresome to get there. But there is no heavy grinding, most card unlocks happen pretty quickly.

You start with some basic cards depending on your clan combination, your primary clan champion, and a set of randomised cards again from your clans. You go through a gauntlet of 7 rings, each with a fight, and 2 paths you can choose, each offering opportunities for upgrades. Standard concepts, like thinning your deck and focusing it apply too (you can remove cards a couple of different ways.) There are 2 types of cards, creatures and spells. Both feature 2 slots for upgrades (3 with the respective artifact). Each battle consists of enemy waves entering the bottom floor of your train, and each turn they attack your creatures on that floor, your creatures attack back, then surviving enemies move up a floor. You have 3 floors to kill them, if they make it to the fourth they damage your pyre, if your pyre reaches 0 health game over.

The basic concepts are simple enough, but there is a hell of a lot of nuance to everything here. The randomized seed of each run provides with unique sets of challenges and opportunities each run, as does the combination of all the clans each with 2 variants. At high levels (the game makes use of a progressive difficulty increase mechanic like slay the spire, but you can always play at lower levels than the max unlocked if you feel you need practice) the game is quite tough and requires good knowledge of mechanics and what your options each represent, but it is very rewarding and enjoyable, even if you lose. 
I rank this game on the same level as slay the spire, which set the golden standard for roguelite deckbuilders, which speaks volumes for the quality of this game. It is heaps of fun, and even though I am not very good at it, I just keep coming back for more, with the goal of scoring a divinity kill with each clan combination (final boss of the dlc) Speaking of the dlc, I consider it mandatory, it offers a lot to the game, and there is no reason not to jump in the game with the dlc active straight away other than budget constraints. The main reason for that is that many of the strategies and tactics that work pre dlc, do not work that well post dlc, so you would be learning wrong things if you spend a ton of time playing without the dlc. At least that was my personal experience, having played a lot before the dlc released, and I know it is shared with a lot of the members of the community. Speaking of which, if you like the game, or have questions about it, the discord is full of friendly and knowledgeable people that can help.

I had seen it a few times in the store because I'm a big Rouge-like deck builder games, but really the videos and screen shots just put me off. Then, Monster Train was on sale for some 60-80% off, so I was like what the heck... Boy am I glad I did give this a try, and my only regret is that I had not played this earlier ! For one, I am not one to write any review as not many games have impressed me over the last few years. A few things about Monster Train 
1. The first thing that you will notice when you start playing is the MUSIC and Sound effects. Normally after a few hours of any solo game, I turn the music off, however with Monster Train, I actually look forward to hearing it !! Far out !! 10/10
2. As it is a ""Train"" game (which I thought was a horrible idea) turns out this into a Tower D esq Rogue-like DeckBuilder game. I thought that it would add an unnecessary element to RL-DB games however, the way the game flows it triples your RL-DB experience. 9/10
3. Graphics - as I said earlier I was put off by the video and screenshots on steam. But after playing the game, the detail and animations was definitely way cooler than I thought. A big plus is that you are playing the ""evil"" ""villainous"" bad@$$ monsters with monstrous abilities. Even though, probably the lowest aspect of this game would be the graphics. All the positives totally outweigh this negative. 6/10
4. Game Play - The sheer amount of upgrades and changes to your deck ALWAYS guarantees a different play through each and every time (unless you aim for a certain type of build, but even then, the outcome always comes out different). Not only this but the sheer amount of combinations that you can manipulate in order to ""break the game"" or basically have god-like combos is well, damn near infinite. For this, I'm curious when I will ever get bored of this game. Probably never... 10/10

In the end is this game worth it? Hell yeah. Is it worth full price? Definitely. Would you recommend it to a friend? Every time.

Unlike other such deckbuilders like Slay the Spire, Griftlands or Tainted Grail, Monster Train requires you to defend the life points of the pyre not with just your main character and perhaps some minor extra help, but with an entire arsenal of monsters, which are also all upgraded separately and serve different functions on the various floors of defence. Granted, there's one hero monster you have and which can be built a strategy around if the chosen clans and artifacts favour this approach. However, Monster Train goes extreme in other directions too, from full-on spell support, extremely hardy defensive monster, floor manipulation, to really ramping up numbers in order to overcome the hellish life pools of the higher difficulty adversaries.    
Having cards of two different clans each run always offers a unique challenge to make a deck work, and while I admit that the RNG factor of getting good artifacts might be one bit too high, the feeling of success when you win against all odds becomes even better therefore.

Where Slay the Spire decisions often give the player small and incremental benefits, Monster Train encourages you to break the game with absurd multipliers and combinations that feel fantastic to pull off. Monster Train focuses on minion combat rather than a main protagonist, which means that you build little connections with each card and you'll find yourself getting excited to find an Overgorger or a specific power-up (StS has this as well, but I think it shines through a bit brighter in Monster Train). The custom soundtrack has gone way under the radar and should really be appreciated more -- I think it's pretty neat.

In my opinion, this game can be enjoyed by two types of gamers:

For someone who is new to deck games or didn't like Slay the Spire:
If you aren't familiar with deckbuilders, this game has enough beginner elements that it's a good jumping-off point into the genre, and it isn't reliant on a ton of experience to get a few wins. If you didn't like Slay the Spire, Monster Train is a bit less math-y at the lower difficulties and the minion elements and sound effects give the game a lot more character. I recommend the base game to anyone who wants to try someone new, but I would save the DLC until you're beating the higher difficulties consistently. You can buy the DLC, switch it off within the main menu, and then save it for when you've gotten the hang of the game.

For the hardcore deck builder:
This game belongs in contention with StS for the best deckbuilder created as of 2021. The control that MT gives the player over your deck in each run, combined with the build-diversity and variety of random events make it infinitely replayable ang every run is winnable. The difficulty curve within a run and as you move up the difficulty tiers feels great, with enough random events and rotating bosses to break up ""meta"" builds from carrying each run. The Last Divinity DLC is another level of complex, for better or worse, but overall it accomplishes the goal of keeping MT fresh and adds an absolutely massive amount of new content and mechanics. There are daily challenges (using positive and negative modifiers) and the ability to create and share your own if that's your thing.",1640892000,1640892253,True,7,0,0.59316331148147583,0,True,False,False

While the core gameplay loop is repetative (and that may bore many or some), I found it to be almost lie a sort of solitare for me.

A game of Monster Train never seems to last super long (longer runs seem to end just around or before an hour) but the variety and challenges are always interesting to me. It takes a bit to get the hang of but once you do the strategy element is great, and each time you beat the game it gets slightly harder so you have to push just a little harder to get further.

I do personally recommend the expansion. There's debate whether you should purchase it immediately but I think that the extra clan to unlock coupled with the new upgrade mechanic (which simultaneously makes the runs more difficult) immediately adds depth without being too complicated -- and you can ignore it if you wish.

You play by deploying monsters onto one of three floors of a train, enemies trickle in the front door, and then your monsters on each floor autobattle them before they can get to the core.

It's a simple foundation, but the game builds expertly on top of it. Gameplay feels fluid, cards are relatively simple, and everything is well explained.

In fact, if you struggled with Slay The Spire, you'll probably cruise through this. Monster Train makes its difficulty optional, and unlockable. You can slowly up the difficulty to make your runs harder, but all that does is unlock the option to make the difficulty even harder. Finishing your first run isn't momentous in Monster Train. It's a game you play because you enjoy playing it, not because you're trying to beat it.

I think some people may be turned off by that---myself among them. I play things partially for the feeling of completion, and Monster Train still has that in the form of new factions and new cards to unlock, but the story is thin and getting a game clear is not a struggle.

I still had a blast with what I've played, and I expect I'll play more before I'm done, but I also anticipate I'll burn out quicker than I did with Slay The Spire.

this game ,while having similar basic mechanics feels very different from slay the spire:
for starters you pick a race,champion and a secondary race and champion 
all of which give you different starting cards,
therefore it has about 16 different starting deck options(you could say 64 too) 
and from a certain covenant(ascension)  it gives you 5 random cards
which means every run starts differently.
every race gives different units and spells which offer you unique strategies
you use to defend your pyre from various angels.
the game is split to two parts one where you defend the train and one where 
you prepare from the next fight both offer many fun and interesting choices to make.
you can even make fights harder for extra gold which let's you upgrade your cards and buy items
during the preparation
all of which leads to a fun gameplay full of variance.
now the music is decent the game controls mostly fine but sometimes
when using spells on opponents i accidentally cast on a different floor
not sure if it's only me, what i think many would agree about is the problem with the visuals
and creature design many creature of the same race look a bit too similar which led me to have
problems identifying some creatures and angels until many hours later and even to 100 hours 
later two angel bosses are almost identical to me.
the game also looks too much like a phone game(a mobile version would be great btw)
in my opinion. not necessarily ugly but requires getting used to.
the covenant system works well and has a solid difficulty curve,i did use the fact you can reset combat
not using the reset might lead to greater frustration but using it might feel cheap.
early covenants might be too easy for more skilled players.
in the end the game is great for card game and strategy fans 
with the visuals as the only small downside

I find the game too easy. 25 different difficulty levels seem good in theory, but in reality you can only select higher one, after you beat the game on the one before. The problem is that I just got bored of the game on difficulty 11. It was still too easy.
You only have 8 fights to do each run. Some powerups in between. All fights are pretty much always the same. There are few variants of bosses, but to be honest it doesn't matter. If you would try to build a deck to focus on countering bosses speccial stuff, you would just waste time, because there often isn't enough time to build a fancy deck. You just go with most powerful combos, which are really easy to make and win regardless of what you fight.

Very easy to get into and very easy to sink countless hours into also which offers great value for money.

Plenty of variety of decks (base game has 5) and you always have 2 decks per game. So 1 deck is your main with a  champion and the second deck is a support deck. As you progress in your run cards for both decks become available to choose from providing a lot of combinations and choice.

Bottom line is the game is very fun and is an easy recommend 8.5/10.

Two improvements I would like to see are : 
1. Higher resolution textures used on all graphics
2. When a floor is packed with units have them spaced out a little more so each unit is more easily identifiable (this is a minor gripe)

If a monster train 2 is in the works I would love to see some type of amazing 3d animation as units battle and spells are used. Sorta like that 3d chess type game in star wars or like the old Amiga game Battle Chess. Not sure if this is viable because animation may slow down the flow of the game but 3d graphics done well could make this amazing.

However, these small gripes are all there is when it comes to criticising it. A game should be judged by how it plays and Monster Train is no mobile game. It's a rare gem indeed, a great product that you can get tens of hours of enjoyment from for a good price.
As a long time fan of the Slay the Spire genre, I dare say Monster Train was a little too easy for me, having beaten it at covenant 25 in about 50 hours, whereas I'm well over 100 on Slay and still haven't passed Ascension 6.
Outside of the main game, which in itself can be replayed a lot , the title offers a series of challenges that can also be played in multiplayer, something unique to Monster Train.

1.  It feels like there's little to no diversity within single factions aka classes, and the game introduces you with only 2 factions so the game feels like the same exact build multiple times until different, similarly narrow-minded factions are unlocked.

2. The progression of deck strength after each fight is so insanely fast that many of the starting cards quickly become worthless and thus an element of in-combat strategy feels lost. First fight you'll have like 2/8 creatures and 2 damage spell cards.  Second fight you'll have a couple 20/10 creatures and a couple 12 damage spell cards.  Like... what?  ""Hmm should I play this 2/8 creature or this 40/20 creature for the same cost?""

3. By the time it feels like building a well-rounded deck, it's over because there's maybe only 6 fights per run.

In MT there are three floors with the ""pyre"" room above it. Enemies start at the bottom and try to make their way to the room to attack the ""pyre"". You place units and cast spells to stop them. These are drawn from a deck that starts with basic cards then gets expanded or reduced in size by picking various options.

[b]The Good[/b]

I was discussing this game and STS on Reddit and suddenly it hit me. STS is a roguelike version of Northmark: Hour Of The Wolf and MT is a roguelike version of The Trouble With Robots.

Like TTWR it's a deckbuilding game in which you summon units and cast spells drawn randomly. This means it combines deckbuilding and tower defense - two of my favourite genres. The combination works so well because normally one of the weaker parts of the TD genre is the predictability of the towers, while deckbuilding tends to suffer from allies only being cards. MT gives you the variation of a card game and the engagement of building characters in a role-playing game.

Another strength of Monster Train, especially compared to Slay the Spire (which i thought was mediocre) is the amount of starting options. There are 6 factions (1 DLC) each with 2 paths each with a hero. You pick a faction and one of its heroes plus one of two path of a support faction. This gives you a ton of options to try out how things combine. And after that there are 26 difficulty levels (Covenant level 0-25) plus modifiers for non-official games (both boni and mali).

Some other points:

-    Games take only 25-50 minutes.
-    Optional bonus boss.
-    Tons of customisation options for both spells and units.
-    Cute theme in which the ""heavenly"" guys are the baddies.
-    All kinds of location events add more variety.
-    The game encourages taking weaker cards by giving special borders/stamps for completing a game with them.
-    Simple to learn, but with quickly ramping difficulty if you want it.
-    The mechanics are quite clever overall - this isn't Hearthstone.

[b]The Bad[/b]

-    Even at Covenant 1 the endboss has twice as much life, which i think is a bit much.
-    At higher Covenant levels you lose more easily to random bullshit like not getting the right upgrade.
-    The Endboss is a bit much at Covenant 25. You can breeze through the rest of the game and still lose.
-    Melting Remnant/Little Fade seems so much stronger than the other factions/heroes.
-    Some units/spells seem much stronger than others (i lost only once when i had a Bounty Stalker).
-    No second chances (though you can Alt+F4 before you lose and try again).
-    It's beyond annoying that you can't pick starting cards - sometimes you have to reroll a dozen times to get good ones.
-    Epic cards (purple dots) are overly rare. In 220 hours i've seen some units only 2-3 times.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

Monster Train combines two genres i love with roguelikes, which i hate. Somehow it still manages to be one of my all-time favourite games. It offers nice, quick card/TD games with a lot of variety and progress to be made. After 60 hours i actually reset my progress to start from scratch, just because it was so much fun. I never do that.

I mean, in this game you can kill the endboss with a buffed oven while both have googly eyes, what more do you want?

- Great deck battler with varied deck building options.
- All cards / deck builds / clan combo seem viable.  
- Really cool concept for different clans and I like that you can combine clan cards. 
- Never feels like you run out of options on how to play your hand, even with a bad draw. 
- Synergies between cards, clans and artefacts very well designed.

DEPENDS
- Visuals are both appealing but chaotic

CONS
- floor 6-8 bosses design/art kinda samey but it's barely a detriment",1638457580,1638457580,True,5,0,0.581749081611633301,0,True,False,False

It shines when you only have 30 or so minutes to play a game and want something to jump into without having to get invested, but the gameplay becomes incredibly stale and predictable. The higher you go, the less viable options there are, to the point where you're basically doing the same thing to win each time. And you'll know you've won by either the second or third fight, everything after that is really just going through the motions.

The two clan system is great on paper, but only some of the clans have actual synergy. More often than not, the other clan cards are just dead weight in your deck that you quickly remove. At the end of most runs, your deck is roughly 90% one clan card, then 10% the other clan. And that's only because you ran out of removal options.

The DLC added a much needed challenge, but was poorly optimized around the base game, rendering several of the hero units as not only worthless, but actively harmful to your deck because you can't remove them and always start with them in your starting hand, effectively making you play with -1 card at the start. The new clan has a really fun mechanic, but again, it lacks any real synergy with the other clans.

Worth picking up on sale. The music is great and the artwork is pretty good. And, despite the criticisms, it really isn't a bad game persay, just feels incomplete and lacking in a lot of areas. You can still have some fun before the flaws really become apparent, and it's a great way to kill time or fiddle around with while you're watching/listening to something else.",1638343384,1638343384,False,1,3,0.403106153011322021,0,True,False,False

It's time to remedy that. Don't let my 1600 or so hours mislead you, I am actually well over 2000 across multiple profiles (and more if you include time spent modding).

This game deserves every bit of the praise it gets, and to say that I overwhelmingly recommend it is an understatement. It is the single best example of evolution of the roguelike deckbuilder genre since Slay the Spire, and differentiates itself so much in the feel, strategy, and design that the two can perfectly coexist for fans of the genre. Monster Train has a staggering amount of content diversity, with six clans in the DLC that can be mixed and matched for a truckload of combos, each playing uniquely. Couple that content diversity with the game's extremely satisfying exponential power curve and you can enjoy surprisingly difficult gameplay (for those seeking it) while still highrolling out of your mind on occasion and blowing your enemies out of the sky. Another crowning achievement of this game in my opinion is how consistent the tooltips are in describing exactly what happens and how things interact. Phrases like ""play a card"" and ""summon"" are precisely used to communicate exact behaviors, and once you understand the rules of the game you can predict nearly every other interaction, even some of the more esoteric ones. There are exceptions, of course, and it's not perfect, but it's 98% of the way there and leaps and bounds beyond other games in this regard. Lastly, while the balance isn't perfect and promotes power-swings from overwhelmingly strong to unbelievably cursed runs, I am a strong proponent that every run is winnable with perfect play, and some will truly test your ability to successfully reason through the decisions presented to you.

All of this isn't to say that the game doesn't have flaws. After 2000 hours, you have the remaining bugs and the design issues memorized by heart, but they're so small compared to the overall enjoyment I've received out of this game that they're barely even worth mentioning in a Steam review. Yes, they should do more regular balance patches; yes, the Umbra clan's Morsel mechanic needs help and is currently designed into a corner; yes, they should address some of the instances of overly punishing RNG like Plink. Despite all that, if you're reading this review looking for help in deciding whether to purchase this game, I can't help but recommend that you pick it up.

I thundered through the campaign for both the base game and DLC in the space of 2-3 days. It's a deeply engaging experience with a lot of interesting challenges and typically resembles something between Hearthstone and a (less intense) darkest dungeon. The deck-building elements are great fun and combinatorial mechanics get really OP really fast if you're using certain factions (anything with Little Fade, honestly). 

The fact that the game lets this happen and promotes it is great. There's deliberate and sharp power creep for both your team and the opponent, and that only multiplies as you start playing up the covenant ranks and using the shards from the Last Divinity DLC. The DLC doesn't add as much game-time as I'd have liked for the fact it costs similar to what I paid for the base game, but the Wurmkin faction and the Last Divinity boss are cool. The shards are by far the most interesting aspect and really do contribute to an even-faster creep in power. 

Monster train has given me nearly 35 hours as of this review and I'll probably be achievement-hunting for another 15-25 over the next few weeks. It's a great game with a lot of charm and it has a bombastic setting that makes the nuttiness at least semi-believable, in its own irreverent way.

The sense of progress provided by climbing covenant ranks, earning card masteries, and unlocking card frame combined with the wide variety of each run has made this game last far longer than any other roguelike or card game for me.",1637480612,1637480612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Before writing this review, I've perused the ""community hub"" discussions for this game and, as a consequence of this, have paid close attention to negative reviews for this game. Why? The people who have negatively reviewed this game have trolled the discussion forums on this game's community hub page. They claim to have ""beaten the game"" and that there is no point in playing the game more. It only took them 60 hours to ""beat the game.""

I don't know about you, but I've won at Klondike Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, Poker, Texas Hold'em, Cribbage, Pyramid Solitaire, Blackjack, Yahtzee, Monopoly, The Game of Life, Candyland, Operation, and a whole bunch more board and card games. I've played them non-digitally and digitally. I don't think I beat any of those games. I won a ""hand of"" or a ""game of,"" but the game itself has no end. I can be good at playing such games, but I could still lose the next time I play. 

My recommendation is to not pay attention to people who claim to have ""beaten"" this game. In reality, what they have done is reach Covenant 25, the highest level possible. Does this mean you can't play the game some more? Ummmm huge nope. If you enjoy playing this game of cards, you can always do challenges and other interesting things and see how you rank among other players. You'll notice that the people who claim to have beaten the game don't talk about how they rank, or what their experience was on a challenge run. You can't beat this game, just like you can't beat any card game. You can become proficient at playing it and, if you enjoy it, you can play it a lot. You can progress through it, learn gradually about how it works. and unlock goodies along the way, and learn how the game works inside and out. You can most certainly level up quick if you wish. That really doesn't mean you beat the game. It means you got a win streak. I'd compare that to getting to the final round of a Texas Holde'em tournament. You didn't beat the game, because the game goes on after you won that particular instance of the game. Get what I mean?

The developers of Monster Train should really quit marketing the ""more playability"" in their advertising blurbs and just say you're playing a game of cards. It's really quite basic. It's a card game. Of course it's replayable. Until the end of time, if you wish. That's why Monster Train attracts trolls who repeatedly say, ""I beat the game! No need to play it again! Got myself to Covenant 25! No point in playing this game anymore!"" What they're saying is that they won a hand of Klondike Solitaire and they beat the game, no need to deal out another hand.

If you love card games and games of chance, this one is for you. If you like learning about how your decisions interact with the cards you choose for your deck (like in any trading card game), this game is for you. 

Monster Train is not for you if you wish to play a video game you can beat. There is no beating a game about playing cards. You can learn how to play it well, and win a lot of games of it, but that's it. 

If you disagree with me, show me how you definitively beat Pyramid Solitaire and Hearthstone and Klondike Solitaire and Poker. Feel free to show me you got to Covenant 25, then show me you know what that means and what the game is all about and really get into it. Randomize your clan alliances. Do a challenge.

For example, Seraph the Diligent will cause each card played at the beginning of a turn to have the consume trait, and Seraph the Chaste will half all buffs and debuffs that do not benefit him. Taking this into consideration is necessary to have a successful run, and each run has its unique concerns.

A lot of fun early in the game, but the higher the covenant rank goes, the more grindy it gets as only luck decides if a run will be winnable or not.
I still recommend the game for the first 70-ish hours of fun (which is great for the price tag!), [u]but it's a thumbs down for turning into a random-based gambling grind fest in the end game, so mind that before purchase[/u].


[b]Details[/b]
Early in the game, it's super fun: Looks great, feels great, runs great, wonderful atmosphere and the same price as Slay the Spire (which I refunded btw).

However, at and above covenant rank 22-ish the game is pure frustration, net grind and random decides if a run is winnable or not, nothing else.

Thanks to everything being random, there's little to no choice: cards, artifacts, Champion skills alike comes what the machine rolls, and on higher levels it's critical to have the right combination and boost of everything, otherwise simply the DPS or ""reform-rate"" or ""boost-rate"" are too low to win the game, no matter how good one plays.

For example, with Melting Remnant, Rector Flicker simply doesn't damage enough to be valuable vs the last boss. Little Fade it is then, right? Indeed, but Eternal Flame is a must have then, and there's a 33% chance it won't happen... One time it didn't come up as a choice about 10 times in a row...
The same applies to the rest of the cards. Most of them (again, on higher covenant levels) are weighless & useless or in the wrong combination, and mobs on higher ranks are so OP, losing is guaranteed with weaker spells and without a good combo of tank (e.g. Lady of XX) + sweep (e.g. Husk Hermit) + low-capacity multistrike DPS (e.g. Draff) units, and with dead weights like Restore or Wildwood Sap or Steelsinger (for a no-heal hand) just to mention a few, out of the 80% of trash cards, randomly rolled in or forced to the hand.
So the only way to win is with the perfect hand, or at least a fixable one, i.e. there's time to get rid of the trash cards, as well as random favors the player going forward in building a good deck.

All in all, the game basically turns into a brainless grindfest. It's very frustrating, as random decides about winning or losing a run, not the player
The game would be fun with little more choices and a little less random...


Adding to this the DLC is so annoying (see my review [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/unqlfife/recommended/1359320/][b]HERE[/b][/url]) I turned it off to play just the base game instead...

While less technically complex, Monster Train's skill ceiling isn't low so there's plenty of longevity.  The different clans (like Magic the Gathering's different mana colours) also provides plenty of variation to keep gameplay fresh.

----

Not going into too much detail in this review. Unlike say Griftlands (another game inspired by StS), I found that I could get into the gameplay for Monster Train almost immediately. It's that easy to grasp (at least for me), and it works well. A few points:


1. The main gameplay is tower defence-like. Kill enemies with static units on each floor (as in they don't chase the enemy) and spells, before they reach your pyre you are trying to protect,
2. The units & spells you use remind me of Magic the Gathering's summoned creatures and spells. There's limited place on each floor though, so choose and position your units carefully.
3. Also like M:tG, you can mix two clans (colours) to try different sterategies.
4. Each run is significantly shorter than StS, maybe a 1/3rd.",1636529727,1636529727,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first I was a bit worried when I saw the visuals, it looked like a mobile game and I wondered if it would be any good but by the time I cleared my first run I was hooked. The high level of reactive strategizing with the variety of options in each faction deck makes it very mechanically immersive. As I unlocked more and more cards and cleared more runs, I found synergy between factions I couldn't have thought of just by looking at them.

The game is also quite steep in it's difficulty, I had a fairly easy time hitting Covenant rank 7 but after that was a real trek. My last rogue like was Hades, which is more combat reactive (something I am more used to) and the cerebral reactions in this game gave a very different but just as satisfactory challenge.

Being new to these type of games, I don't have much more to say but I can very safely recommend it.

I had prepared backup of other cards with high health. I was unstoppable. Thought I broke the game. But he had one weakness. Low health. I hit a boss that had a sweep attack. Lost the run. That's the kind of variability you'll experience here. 

You even have access to modding in case the game is too hard. Like having cheat codes. There is nothing I can complain about really. Maybe that it would be nice to have more clans. But that might break that perfect balance. Every clan and clan combination (you get a 2nd backup clan to combine two in a run) is worth a try and plays competently.

If you're on the fence but you like deckbuilder roguelikes, I can safely tell you to go ahead and skip this review - you can buy Monster Train with confidence. It's fantastic and I can easily recommend it just as strongly as I would recommend Slay The Spire. The game plays great, the variance is excellently balanced, there are many valid builds for huge replayability, and overall everything is just about perfect for a game in this genre.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*] The faction system allows you to mix and match decks for a new experience every time, or to stick with a combination of elements you feel comfortable with
[*] Unlockables add more variety to each faction as you play them but aren't necessary to win - they just add more spice
[*] Art is just excellent across the board. All of the cards, characters, and set pieces are beautifully illustrated
[*] Every single unit or spell deck in your card can be upgraded in a variety of fashions for even [i]more[/i] build depth - or with the DLC, you can even mash them together!
[*] Cards are clear in what they do, the UX is excellent. The cards read well and balance form and function. Tooltips abound for expanded information. This is simply deckbuilder UX done right.
[*] The UI works very well. You can check what's in your library, what's been discarded, what the results of your action will be, etc. You don't have to spend a bunch of time calculating action paths or doing math by hand, Monster Train is non-adversarial in that regard and arms you with knowledge to ease the playthrough rather than hoping you'll trip up with bad math.
[*] Difficulty seems spot on, and can be adjusted to suit your desired challenge level. Most runs are winnable if played smart, once you know what you're doing, but the game doesn't feel easy because of that. Winning runs are usually a result of proper setup, planning, and customization. If you push your luck at the wrong time or you neglect to apply what you've learned previously, it can all fall apart on you quickly.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
My cons are mostly minor quibbles, nothing here is a big deal. There aren't a lot of flaws, and to be honest, I really had to dig to think up things to put here.
[list]
[*] Initial build-up can be a little slow. Unlock the other clans, play around for a bit, really get to know the game before you judge it. The initial options are a bit tame and the difficulty may feel too easy while it lets you learn the first few games.
[*] Some balance issues - some clans, champions, or upgrade paths are just plain not as good as others (I'm looking at you, Hellhorned). It's good to have the variety, but I wish they were more functionally useful in a greater number of cases.
[*] The music while good, lacks variety. It is subtle enough that it won't grate on you, but there aren't a ton of tracks.
[*] Sound design in general is a bit of a mixed bag. Nothing is what I would classify as bad [i]per se[/i], just some of the effects seem like strange choices and/or get repetitive. The SFX get the job done and are inoffensive, but they're not great.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I can rarely recommend a game this strongly. If you like deckbuilder roguelikes, you will like this game. It takes elements you already know and love, adds in placement zones and defense mechanics, spices it up with heavy per-run customization, and lets you choose the experience you want on every run. If you've never played a deckbuilder-style roguelike here, this (or Slay The Spire) is an excellent place to start. There's a lot to unlock, huge replayability, and the experience is consistently enjoyable from start to finish. Monster Train is an excellent buy at full price, and if you see it on sale I'd snap it up right away.",1636013847,1636013888,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Comparisons to Slay the Spire are inevitable, but ultimately this game plays differently enough to not feel like a clone. It's still squarely within the deckbuilder rougelite genre, so if you've played anything in the genre before you'll get up to speed quickly.

There's 5 clans/classes (each with an unlockable alternate sub-class) in the base game, and each one plays differently from the other. Before beginning a run you need to choose one of these, as well as a secondary allied clan from the same group of 5. This choice then determines the pool of cards and items you can run into throughout your run. Because each of the classes/clans play rather differently from each other, there's a fairly large amount of viable strategies.

Experimenting with these combinations is fun, and because each run isn't particularly lengthy (maybe anywhere from 30-60 minutes), the game seems to actively encourage this experimentation. As with all of these similar sorts of games, RNG of course plays a role, but I wouldn't say that I've ever felt quite as screwed over it by as I have in other similar games like this. Upon finishing a run, you'll level up the clans/classes you chose and unlock additional cards, challenges, and items that you might encounter in future runs.

All in all, a very solid option within this genre. Deep enough to keep veterans of the genre engaged, but still very approachable for newcomers.",1635424659,1635424659,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Looked at the clock in my first 2 hours, completed two games, both different and mind blowing.

Tried to make a pattern on hours 4 - 5 but forget that... cards, monsters, talents all change and so did the cards massing in strength.

Hour 6 cried because we lost the train.
Lost the feeling felt which was an EPIC team build on this run.... to find out not so much with one HUGE flaw, magic control. Shazam! Gone... damn.

Hour 7 tried and tried to get cards in flow, when to save and buy, artifacts and style, all the past hour in trying to be perfect... and well.... still lost. DANG IT!

Hour 8... Just a bit outside. Was almost at game end... and could see the light... now only see dead people!

Hour 9... HOLY F... I need rest, food, the restroom and lost 3 lbs from dehydration... damn Monster Train!

Would play another 9 hours for weight loss.

As such, comparisons with other games, like Slay the Spire, are inevitable. Personally, I would say that MT isn't all that different. But what it lacks in mechanical originality, it exceeds in streamlining the core experience of a deck builder; the variety of deck builds. Indeed, the base game comes with 10 different champions each with diverse upgrade paths. Throw in the fact that each run is based on a clan pairing, your pool of draftable cards has a sizeable amount of diversity. Your builds can be as varied as you like and the ability to customise mutators creates even more opportunity to experiment with your wildest theorycrafting.

I have to admit that the deciding factor between whether I enjoy a deck-building game or not is rooted in the thematic & aesthetic design. At first, the visual design did not hook me at all. I felt that the illustrations were far too exaggerated & 'cartoony'. There was a slight clash between the 3D rendered Boneshaker and its 2D occupants, the most egregious dissonance found with the train wheels. However, as I played more and more the characters started to grow on me. It's difficult to dislike the cute Umbra morsels.

Additionally, I appreciate the amount of care poured into writing the flavour text. Each card has a sizeable lore blurb that ties the MT world together. Admittedly, the story isn't particularly fleshed out but the subtle references that underpin the card descriptions, enemy encounters, and random events, truly sparks the world to life. [spoiler] Fel's Wings of Light theme seems to echo with the clang of a hammer & anvil, perhaps a nod to Heph's status as her purported daughter? [/spoiler] Ultimately, without the lore & aesthetic, you're just playing a numbers-generator.

I definitely recommend Monster Train as its given me some enjoyable experiences.

Such as, the first time you reach a bosses' Relentless phase. The moment when the words, ""Relentless"", appear evoke the Boss Warning trope √† la Mega Man. There's something visceral about seeing the boss launch themselves into your minions at Ultra speed and subsequently encase the defeated floor in solid ice.

However, the highlight of my experience would definitely be building the chonkiest, absolute unit of an Ember Forge. I found it a nice touch that there's many ways to increase both the stats and the physical size of a card unit. Seeing the Ember Forge width fill the entirety of the train floor and its chimney protruding into the floor above was particularly satisfying.

Did I complete the run successfully, of course not. But I definitely had fun!",1635263129,1635263129,True,12,0,0.624326825141906738,0,True,False,False

You like card games? Like experiment? Like rogue-like RNG? Like board game like tactics? Deck building? 

If the answers were yes, then give this game a try. Your the last hope for hell as you try to relight the Pyre by driving the Boneshaker, the train on the railway, down the tracks through each ring of hell, and picking your path and resources, while fighting off the forces of Heaven trying to destroy the heart of your train.

Each ring has multiple bosses (with boss variants), the resources RNG'd between 2 paths, you also pick one of five (six with dlc) clans with unique gameplay plus one to support, each clan has a unique champion (2 champs with dlc) with 3 upgrade paths plus , you start with a semi random deck (a set base of cards, plus 5 random ones), Each clan has 40 (41 dlc) cards to use to build a unique deck each run. Plus random events, artifacts supplying passive buffs and effects, a 4 level train (3 areas to fight and the 4th being your pyre to defend), and you have a unique run every game. Did I mention you can modify (upgrade) card with random upgrades from the merchants?

this game is a GOD DAM DELIGHT to play if you love card and board games as it combines elements from both with lots of strategy.

For those looking to buy this game and still thinking about it, maybe this would help. Think about the Darkest Dungeons, IRATUS and Magic the gathering (If you are familiar with those titles). Then put them all in a whole new adventure train to re-igniting Hell. Hell yeah!~ 

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Build your own deck and strategies 
- I haven't played a game with this much replayability. 
- It's fun to see how you compete with your friends and even the community.
- Having the rarest card collections and achievements.

It is VERY short with a very low replayability. And I know this is simple ""runs-based"" roguelike, but it is still short and subpar comparing to many good roguelikes on the market.

There is no time for any real deck bulding (which was supposed to be the point of this game), so most runs are about picking up the copies of 2-3 best cards for a faction and getting rid of weaker cards whenever possible. 80% of cards and combos in this game are mostly useless, because the run will end before you upgrade your deck and ""mana"" enough. None of the playable combos is too sophisticated either - its mostly about putting same monsters in same places in every fight and then spamming same 1-2 cards over and over. The game is also very easy - once you discover best combos and effects, you will have no motivation to search harder. All replayability and difficulty in this game is artificial  - instead of longer, more challenging runs, deck building and new encounters, its up to the player to set himself some game modifiers or pick subpar champions/factions to make his life harder. Not fun and a very lazy idea.

Its all sad because when you start the game you can spend the whole evening playing, without even noticing.

I left a quick review saying as such, and anointed it my Game of the Year 2020, which, to be honest, should really be all you need to give it a try if you have even a cursory interest in deckbuilding games.

I want to say a little more this time around, but for the most part my original thoughts are still basically the same, so I wouldn‚Äôt sweat my detailed review and instead just go get it.

Monster Train is a marvellous fusion of the tower defence and roguelite deckbuilder genres, which proves to be a jazztastic combination. Your run-to-run strategies focus on creating a defensive setup across three floors of your eponymous train; the ‚Äútowers‚Äù having been replaced by units. Once assigned to a floor it‚Äôs tricky to reassign creatures (exceptions apply), so your run is spent visualising which units will populate which floors, and in what order. You'll think about which monsters you're using to tank, and which are for damage or support, as well as what types of enemies your setup handles well, and what areas you still need to find solutions for.

Monster Train opts for a savvy design focus where the game [i]wants[/i] you to create a deck so hideously busted it threatens to collapse the train with its brilliance, and it isn‚Äôt coy about this fact. After every battle you‚Äôre given stopping points to buy powerful upgrades for your creatures and spells. Have an insane death machine that hurls out damage? How would you like to make it attack multiple times? Got a tank that can withstand a battering ram? How about making it so it always revives on death? And don‚Äôt forget the stops that let you straight up [i]duplicate a card in your deck[/i]. Got a spell that always comes back to your hand and forces enemies not to take a single attack in their journey through your train? Have another, treat yourself. Runs are about finding the thing that makes your strategy ludicrous and leaning into it‚Ä¶ [i][b]HARD[/b][/i].

And the crazy part is it never seems that unobtainable. It always feels like you‚Äôre just one draft or upgrade away from something utterly out of control. This is a far cry from Slay The Spire‚Äôs more measured progression, where something monstrous is a product of careful early choices and cautious balancing of options until later in a run. Seeing things come together in Monster Train makes you feel like a genius as your build not just hums but roars. 

And I think this has something to do with the pacing of each run. There‚Äôre only nine battles in Monster Train, and they blast past as your train rockets its way along the track towards Hell‚Äôs core. As a result, runs are a little quicker, but it‚Äôs also why you get so powerful so fast, as there‚Äôre only a handful of fights to get through before the final boss. There‚Äôs perhaps less variety in terms of opposition line-ups across the battles when compared to Slay the Spire (though some line-ups will force you to make small adjustments to your standard strategy), however I feel Monster Train avoids the tedium of the 40+ fights you endure on your way to Slay the Spire‚Äôs peak. Overall, I enjoyed the pacing and shorter timeframe for putting together a deck in the space of a run.

I haven‚Äôt even got to the glorious part of Monster Train. There‚Äôre five factions and you combine two each run (a primary and secondary). Each faction has its own keywords and basic interactions, but the mashup of two factions together means you get to combine their strengths or cover their weaknesses as you see fit. Incredibly, this combination approach provides such a vivid amount of replayability. You can be playing a run and feeling like one of the creatures you picked isn‚Äôt quite working and suddenly think ‚ÄúI wonder what it‚Äôd be like to have this other faction‚Äôs core keyword in combination with this?‚Äù And that‚Äôs your inspiration for your next run idea. There‚Äôre so many possibilities that form out of the combination system. Sure, deck design ideas sort of boil down to some core archetypes, but the process of getting there is always fascinating.

Progression in Monster Train is a bit of a mixed bag. There‚Äôre a lot of unlockables to aim for early on: additional factions, alternative champions, new cards; but you‚Äôll get most of this fairly quickly even if you‚Äôre a relatively casual player. After that you mostly focus on moving up the covenant (difficulty) ranks (more on this in a mo). There‚Äôre a few other goals you can do if you play a lot of the game e.g. winning a run gives every card used in that deck a special border to enjoy, so you can try and finish runs with cards you haven‚Äôt used before, or you can try and explore upgrade paths for champions you‚Äôve not revealed yet. But mostly the progression at this point feels a little bit like completionism more than anything else.

On the topic of the covenant ranks, they‚Äôre [i]okay[/i]. For the most part, the additional wrinkles they throw in [i]seem[/i] annoying, but winning decks rarely feel like the extra challenges are significant hurdles to them. There‚Äôre about three or four ranks that offer significant drawbacks that will really affect your play, but the fact that there‚Äôre another 21 ranks or so feels more like it would give people reasons to keep playing, rather than just lumping all the difficulty into a few tougher jumps. I don‚Äôt hate it, because there‚Äôs a lot to explore in the deckbuilding options Monster Train offers, but, for the most part, the covenant climb is more of a carrot than an obstacle.

That said, by the time you‚Äôre playing on the hardest levels of the covenant then it becomes really hard to tell whether you‚Äôre making good choices or whether you‚Äôre just being blessed by RNG. I often play runs and feel like I‚Äôm making super solid design decisions and then things just feel like they‚Äôre falling apart anyway. I try and think back on what I could‚Äôve changed and it isn‚Äôt always super clear if it would‚Äôve made any real difference. I could just be a bad player, and I know there‚Äôs for sure more I learn about strategy every time I play, but I‚Äôve played all the way to the top covenant and I feel like my decision making approach has been largely similar throughout (aside from learning what common pitfalls to avoid). Does this make the gameplay any less unsatisfying? Perhaps, but if you get that far then you‚Äôve probably got good value for money out of the game anyway.

As a final note, if you‚Äôve got a few friends (or even if not) then I‚Äôd highly recommend trying out the Hell Rush variant as well. It boggles my mind that no one thought of this mode before. Essentially, all players play the same seed run at the same time. Battles and post-battle rewards are all on a timer, and you‚Äôre forced to simply auto-resolve the remaining rounds of a fight if you run out of time. Playing along with your friends and discussing the choices you make along the way as you try and outlast them is such a wonderful experience, and you‚Äôll find your decks often diverge a lot more than you‚Äôd expect. Even more impressive is that Monster Train‚Äôs team managed to include this mode without taking resources away from the game‚Äôs overall experience at all.

Overall, I‚Äôve been massively impressed by Monster Train, and, while I don‚Äôt play it constantly, I go back to it every few months to do a little more, and it‚Äôs an enjoyable experience every time. Most recently, I‚Äôd never managed to find a reason to play Penumbra‚Äôs Architect upgrade path, and one of my most recent runs finally had a call for it, so I got to explore that area for the first time at around 120 hours of gameplay.

A quick note about the DLC: it‚Äôs good, but it‚Äôll take you a few runs to acclimatise to the changes it adds. Definitely only worth getting if you‚Äôve played a good chunk of the base game and want some more variety.",1590524163,1634923397,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many reviewers here will praise it for being fast paced and allow a lot of variety. I think it is too fast, and doesn't allow you to really do much deck building. Once you are getting close to a fun build, you are done. And a part of the difficulty scaling in the game is adding bad cards to your starting deck, that you have to spend the short game removing again. Very bad mechanic, in my opinion. I would also say, that there might be a decent amount of variety yes - but a lot of cards are deadweight if not in the correct build, meaning less flexibility. Overall I feel like there is more boring or wrong choices in this game, and many of the choices I get to make during a game is either: boring or meaningless.

StS is a survival game, and this makes me feel crummy sometimes.In MT, you make game breaking combos and decimate the bosses, except they scale exponentially too, and you can lose if you mess up. This makes it very satisfying to win but very challenging at the same time. DLC is a must, the infusion mechanic literally exponentiates the number of viable strategies.

I don't know why this game isn't more popular. I have never found a game with as much depth and replayability as Monster Train. It's like Slay the Spire + Tower defense. I like so many things about it:
1. Combination of 2 clans: You end up with 36 different overlapping card pools. Each clan has 2-3 main mechanics. Healing is primarily an Awoken thing, Spell damage is primarily Stygian and so on. This restriction also adds a lot of variety. Some runs, you will know you have no way to heal, but some runs you can go all in on tank and spank. Masterful game design.
2. Game length: 9 rounds, Each is 15 mins at most. I finish most runs in 45 mins.
3. Auto combat: The tower defense style means you don't need to painfully target each attack. (unlike Slay the Spire, which gets tedious)
4. Daily Challenges: For even more variety there are mutators you can apply to every run. And there are daily challenges with leaderboards. I have probably been playing 2 of these, the one without the DLC and the one with DLC almost daily for 2 months.
5. You can share seeds, adding a community aspect to the game.
6. Card design: I think the clans are done well. Maybe there is room for improvement, but there are very few cards that are powerless.
7. OP by design: Instead of trying to balance the cards, you win Monster Train by making an OP deck that can dish our thousands of damage in a turn. And there are many ways to make OP decks. I don't know if this was intentional, but it makes the game really satisfying. Your goal in every run is to exploit some combo and go completely out of control.
8. My recommendation would have been tepid for just the base game, but the DLC lets you infuse units into each other and exponentially explodes the number of viable strategies. Insanely good game design.

Cons:
1. Lore; There is some Hell vs Heaven lore going on but it's not super clear and not super interesting.
2. Too many bells and whistles. I like the variety but there are so many game modes. I would like to play Hell Rush, but there are often not enough people in that mode. There could be ways to fix this, e.g. have a global hell rush every 15 mins. I'm happy to wait that long to get a full lobby. Another thing is the covenants, you basically play only Cov 1 or 25, but the levels in between are just progression stages.
3. Limited variety in enemies, bosses and events: There are enough artifacts to keep runs interesting, but you start to realize that each ring can only have a few enemy types. The pool of bosses is limited. This is probably necessary to keep the game balanced w.r.t. your power level in each ring, but it feels a little too predictable after a while. This is not a shortcoming of the game implementation, but of the overall design. It'll be tough to add more enemies while still maintaining balance, and I don't see them doing it. But looking at what they did with the DLC, I wouldn't be surprised.
4. Limited variety in events: Some events like the one with the blacksmith or Dante are really fun, but you run out of events long long before you unlock all clan cards. I think this is actually a major shortcoming of the game, and realizing this was the first time I felt dissatisfied with the game.
4. Shard mechanics in the DLC are a little unclear. There seem to be 4 levels of threat, but I don't know what they do and this makes planning harder. I don't want to memorize impact of taking shards or looking it up on the wiki. If they made the impact more transparent, it would add another layer of strategy, and could resolve my complaint about lack of enemy variety.",1634103673,1634105086,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the variety in the start of the game, something I felt StS lacked. You have 5 factions each with 2 champion sets. You get to choose 2 unique factions and champion sets to start the game (although you only use 1 champion). Once you get a covenant level or two you will also receive random starting cards which further change each run. Overall I think the starting situation removes the boring start that StS has at the beginning of each run. I played through with random/random selected each run which I highly recommend so you don't get hung up on 1 strong combination.

The ability to upgrade cards can make 1 card carry a lot of weight. There are a lot of fun possibilities with just the ""Hold Over"" upgrade for spells. This combined with the simpler choice tree make it so each run you feel powerful. The choices aren't impacted by battle choice either so you really get what you want each option. Overall I just felt more consistent than StS.

I felt the covenant system progressed with you as you got better at the game. Some of the final ones were a bit too big of a step but most of them were small changes that add up. I don't remember much about the ascension levels in StS but I actually enjoyed the grind in this one and I didn't really enjoy it in StS.

The covenant system also leads into my only real cons with the game:
1. I felt the final few ranks were a bit too steep. They really make me want to play at lower ranks than try to actually go the completionist route of winning with each faction/champion combination. After beating rank 25 once, I'm pretty much done with the game unless there is DLC released.

2. The expert challenges should have been unlocked prior to rank 25. I think they add a much needed variety for when you get frustrated with the covenant grind. I also wish you could play them not at rank 25.

3. I wish there was an undo button. A lot of strategy games do this but when my cat walks across my keyboard and hits the end turn button, I would really like to undo that instead of having quit the game and restart the fight which is pretty close to cheating imo. I also sometimes misplayed spells from either wanting to put them back into my hand or my mouse slid last minute and it casted on the wrong target. Overall I think if I'm playing a game solo, there should be no reason to not be able to undo your last action or even entire turn.

Overall for the price this game offers a fantastic deck builder that I feel like almost anyone can get their money's worth. I plan on buying the DLC next sale.",1633811537,1633811537,True,2,0,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False

It fuses the elements that work from other popular deckbuilders and weaves them perfectly into its Tower Defense-like gameplay. I personally really love the upgrades system- each card has 2 slots for upgrades, and you can add basically any combination you can think of to them! This makes it really refreshing to what StS clones typically do, where they have the base card and a flat upgraded form, since YOU decide what the card's upgraded form does! 
On top of this, each clan leader card has three upgrade trees, each going to a level of 3, that you can mix and match to create some devestating combinations. I really love how no option feels awful, just not your style, at worst. Take the Melting Remnant's tree that gives him a large attack and health pool, as well as Burnout- sure, you lose out on Reform each turn, but if you get enough Reform spells later in your run, you now have an absolute beast of a unit to play!

Each of the clans in the game are insanely fun, to boot! I found the beginner clan options to be the worst, obviously, with complete duds that feel super hard to win with, but as you unlock more clans, you get to truly experience what makes Monster Train a master class in its genre. 

My favorite clan combination is Melting Remnant primary / Umbra secondary. They both play into themes of having units die in combat, and overall synergize really well. Melting Remnant is truly the hardest class to put down- something about it just clicks with me. It's part ""number gets larger"" and part ""graveyard recursion"" that just makes it so satiafying.

This is a 10/10 game for anyone that's a fan of roguelike deckbuilders. If you're looking for a game that isn't just a Slay the Spire clone, look no further!

The game is kind of a combination of slay the spire, hearthstone, autobattlers, and possibly even a little tower defense in an abstract way.

My biggest gripe though is that you can't just be 'good', you have to be 'broken'.

It's obviously similar in the way that you draw and play cards and turn-based combat happens, and the functions of some of the cards are similar/the same, as is the idea of using energy (ember) to play cards,  but there's a whole lot that's different too.

There are two types of cards - spell cards and unit cards. The primary means of combat is by spawning several units (by playing cards) which do the fighting for you, then you use your cards to heal, buff etc. those units using spells. Spells can also be used to damage enemies directly, and apply debuffs to them, but for most builds the units do most of the work.

There are 5 different ""clans"" in the base-game, each of which has 2 ""champion"" units. Each champion unit brings a different skillset, and different cards along with it (though there is some crossover between the two champions in each clan), and then for each run you also pick an ""allied"" clan and champion (though you don't actually *get* the champion card) which again influences the cards and units you get. This means there's a whole load of different combinations of ""builds"" that you can run with, just with the initial choice of which champion/allied clan (I think that's 80 combinations?), and then each of those clans has different combos of starter cards you can get randomly, and 3 different champion upgrades, of which you get a choice of 2 each time randomly. And I guess that's a lot of randomness but it's within set confines and it never feels like you're without good choices.

All of the clans and champions are very different. They've done a *really* good job of making the gameplay for each champion and clan different. There are a lot of mechanics which totally change the way you play for a run, and there's something for every play style.

Ultimately, I would say that, comparing it to Slay the Spire, there is probably more depth with Monster Train, though it's not so brutally hard,

The only real thing I've run into that's a bit frustrating is sometimes the abilities of the final boss in particular can *really* screw you over and it can feel like there's not that much you can do about it. Mostly, with careful play you can get around these abilities but once in a while it just feels like you get screwed.

Overall though, very fun, lots of replay value, and I think I'll keep coming back to it.

Spire can be downright brutal even at the early levels, but Monster Train is just more forgiving. The graphics are gorgeous, and I didn't see any inconsistencies with language or keywords - which is paramount for a card game that relies on such nuances.  

For the negatives here, balance of factions comes quickly to mind. Some are just obscenely easy to finish consistently with, and others rely on outright tons of RNG (both in what cards you take, what artifacts you gain, and your literal draw in a match). Overall though, the curve is much smoother even with the most RNG-based faction than Spire. 

The other big negative is the ""roguelike"" aspect where finishing and leveling up factions can actually hamper you - when you first unlock a faction, it's SUPER consistent because your card pool is so limited. You know what you are going to get in virtually every run. Once you level up and unlock more cards, well... that dilutes your card pool from the initial starting stock. Some of the additional cards can be great, others not so much. In the end, you play with what you are dealt, but it's an aspect of the game that feels out of place. Instead of earning more, it can feel like a punishment.

Compared to e.g. Slay the Spire, it ramps up the power of your deck very fast, and there seems to be more of a choice in how to play as you between stages always divert your path to pick what kind of nodes you are interested in.

Nodes are spell upgrade, unit upgrade or artifact shops; main faction or allied faction unit drops; gold, health or artifact drops; card duplication; up to two card discard; and special events.

Factions are basically melee offence focused Hellhorned, restoration and growth focused Awoken, spell and debuff focused Stygian Guard, environmental and consumptive focused Umbra, and decay and replacement focused Melting Remnant. Each faction has two champions with different properties and starting cards, and in a run you choose one faction for your in-play champion and half your cards, and one allied faction out-of-play champion for the other half of your cards. Well, there are non-faction cards as well, but the main gist is still the same.

Each fight you have three floors with a non-combat fourth floor with the pyre you're trying to defend at the top. Fights are done by using your energy and cards from your hand to place units on the floors, cast spells or remove junk cards. Enemies normally move up a floor each turn they survive. Every fight is concluded by a boss fight, but every so often you get a major boss who is present outside the floor but moving between floors, having some effect on their current floor. Each of the major bosses has a few different modes.

Welcome to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/]Monster Train[/url], a deck building game where you have to summon creatures and cast spells to defeat invading enemies.

[h2]Visuals and Audio[/h2]

First off, the art style is very vibrant. The train and its creatures all stand out. Colours pop out, from the backgrounds to your cards in your hand. Your spells, like explosions, have effects that look like they fit in the game. Everything has that polished stylised artwork as it's a bit cartoony but not overly so. A plus is that the game does not take itself too seriously. It has a bit of humour with flavour text and the like. The music is great and fits the style of the game. The sound effects like ice crystalizing or hitting enemies with a tree trunk all all sound good as well.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
You get a starting deck of cards with basic creatures and spells that are based on one of the 5 clans (6 with the DLC). They all have different play styles. For example: The Hellhorned do high damage and have armour synergies while The Stygian Guard will have weaker units but have strong debuffs and spells.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2599405481 

Once you choose the starting deck you enter the core game loop. Battles and Deck Building.

[list][*]Battles are fought on 3 floors at a time. The bottom, middle and top parts of the train are all locations you can place creatures that you randomly draw from your deck. Once you play your turn, the enemies turn start by attacking on their floor followed by your creature counter attack. The invaders then move one level up if they survive. Your goal is to make them not go through the top floor as that's when they damage your train's life points. Lose all your life points and the game is over.

[*]After winning battles you get the chance to upgrade your cards. You can then customise your deck by getting new cards or upgrading current ones. And this part makes the game for me, you get to experiment a lot which is a big plus. The game is designed to create BIG damaging combos.[/list]

[h2]What's my Point of View[/h2]

This is one of the few games that I played that I cannot find a bad thing about it. Each time you try a run there is something new to discover like a new combo, new bonuses or even changing the rules of a battle in your opponents favour. Monster Train is simple and entertaining while offering just enough challenge.

What I find the most fun in MT is figuring out the puzzle of the run to make it a winning run, going from zero to ravaging monstruous steamroller.

The combat is also fun in its unique way, it is a constant balance between long-term and short-term decisions. I‚Äôm coming from Slay the Spire (StS), and I find it satisfies the same itch, but if you don‚Äôt like Slay the Spire you might be overlooking Monster Train because those two games are still very different.

MT has a unique approach to CCG (computer card game.) It is very consistent yet each run is unique and fun in their own way.  The map design is very restricted: Each run has 8 battles, 3 of which are bosses. Between each battle, you have to select between two sets of 3 event tiles (which can be shops, random events, card removal etc.) Your choice will most of the time be guided by the needs and opportunities you identified in your deck. This means [b]you improve through choices you made in event tiles[/b]. I would say the decisions you make in event tiles are more important than your combat abilities.

The way combat works in MT gives you a lot of room for planning. It looks like a tower defense game, where you have 3 floors to ready before invasion by enemies. The enemies spawn at the bottom and work their way up, you have to eliminate them all before they get to the top. Each combat ends with a midboss that has to kill everything on a floor before proceeding to the next. Preparing for the midboss is key to victory. This results in a more strategic gameplay than a StS. In StS each combat turn is basically a procedurally generated puzzle you have to solve, you have to do some planning within combats but it‚Äôs a minor part of it. In MT, because enemies move through your train one level at a time, and the game gives you a combat preview, it‚Äôs easy to know what is coming and you can plan accordingly.  The combat then becomes a fight to get your plan to execute properly, you have to balance short-term and long-term decisions in order to be ready for the ‚Äúfinal wave‚Äù and stomp on the midboss. It‚Äôs a very different feel but it‚Äôs equally fun!

Actually, I decided to write this review after a particularly fun run, I hope this doesn‚Äôt read like an alien language to someone who never played the game‚Ä¶ The run had an insane combination that made short work of the final boss. I had a [i]hellhorned brute[/i], and a [i]horned warrior[/i] that could hit twice per turn. [i]Rage[/i] gives +2 damage to your unit, and with [i]hellhorned brute[/i] it gives +5. I had [i]Ritual of battle[/i] which gives +10 rage to a unit when played. I could use that card to improve the damage of my [i]horned warrior[/i] by 100! (5 * 10 * 2 hits) I made sure to buff the HP of both units so they survive hits. I also upgraded my [i]Ritual of Battle[/i] to make it cheaper to play and with [i]Holdover[/i] which let me draw it each turn. So each turn, I would increase the damage output of my units by 100, plus whatever more I could do that turn (which amounted to about 100 more damage.) The result was that no enemy unit could pass the first level of my train and the final boss ate it at the second turn of the final wave. And this is pretty much the most basic interaction you can get working.

Each of the 5 classes in MT has their own mechanics that I feel can get out of control in their own way. It‚Äôs terribly fun and after 20 hours of gameplay I feel like I only scratched the surface.

I have a few very minor complaints with the game, but really nothing to detract from the fun it is:
[list]
[*] The music. I turned it off after my first run because I did not like it at all. And I‚Äôm someone very easy to please with game soundtracks. The sound effects are also not good, but not bad either.
[*] The graphics are no more than functional. I find the enemy units to be very ugly and boring, the player units are alright but no more. 
[*] The UI is sometimes a bit wonky. You have to navigate more menus than necessary to do things (especially starting a run.) The clickable areas are too small and I‚Äôve had one case of the wrong card being selected for an effect (although I could correct it before confirming.) But the core gameplay UI works well enough for the weirdness to not be noticeable when playing.
[*] The performance on 4K. It just requires way more resources for 4K than necessary. I have the GPU to run it, but for a CCG, I don‚Äôt see why a top of the line GPU is necessary. I manage to get better performance by using a custom Proton version on Linux with FSR upscaling injection. But direct support for FSR would be welcome, as the FSR injection hack makes the UI look uglier.

This game is somewhat about RNG sure but most of it is literally you sitting there, playing a card expecting an amazing result only to realize that you didn't consider a consequence and now your unit is DEAD. Or you're doing amazing, so confident, your deck is perfect and all of the sudden, you lose, your pyre is dead. So you sit there and just stare at the screen because you have NO IDEA what just happened. My favorite is playing a card, it's awesome, you think you just made the game winning move, you figured it all out but.. you didn't read the fine print on a boss. They have stealth. You put alllll of your damage on your first row of enemies and they will all DIE and not do a single hit of the 400 DMG you thought they'd do so.. you sit there with your hands in your hair, your head leaned back and scream at the ceiling because what else are you gonna do. Quite literally, 80% of me playing this game is me going ""WHY DID YOU JUST DO THAT!?"" or ""WHAT DID YOU JUST DO!!??"" to myself and my cats staring at me like i'm insane. 

That is this game in a nut shell. Some RNG but most is completely you and going back and trying to be better. 18 hours and I only have 2 victories. This is my first deck builder ever so I'm sure that people out there with a ton of experience think that's pretty sad but man, those 2 victories, man did they feel good. And I will say, a lot of the YT's that I've been watching fail A LOT of the time so I'd recommend if you are new like I am or a veteran to the genre. It seems to be quite the challenge for many but in my opinion, not due to a poorly balanced game.

Your objective is to make it through the nine circles of Hell and relight the pyres that the angels have snuffed out. The angelic hordes will attack your train in waves, climbing the three floors where you play your demonic defenders and eventually attacking the Pyre at the top. If the Pyre loses all health, your run is over and you lose. If you can survive all the fights and defeat the final boss, you win.

Each game will involve cards from two of the demonic clans, which give a good variety of mechanics that will play the game substantially differently. One of the two clans will also give you a champion, a very powerful unit that starts each fight in your hand.

This is a well crafted game that takes the formula that Slay the Spire put together and iterates on it in several ways. Earning access to more cards and relics as you go keeps you coming back for more, and the variety of the various clan combinations does a lot to keep the game fresh",1630348562,1630348562,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game perfectly fits my personality and play-style: I am a control freak who wants to build the perfect deck and destroy my enemies DECISIVELY. Monster Train usually let's you do this (especially in the lower difficulty levels). This is because there are things that the game ALWAYS allows you to do at specific points in the game: remove cards, increase card draw, reduce card cost, etc. I can usually get my deck down to just the (very powerful) cards I want and have them drawn each turn. The game also has a fixed number of levels with some bosses visible to you from the beginning. So after playing a couple dozen times, you get a sense of the game's rhythm and can start to think several steps ahead.

Compare this to STS which has many different paths, no guaranteed upgrades, unknown bosses, and lots of randomness. Sure it's quite satisfying when you get that amazing run, but for me, I play this game as a stress reliever and a release (i.e. I want the satisfaction of WINNING and winning OVERWHELMINGLY). I really don't mind win streaks that are hundreds of games long. The thing is, even though I can reliably win runs in Monster Train, it ALWAYS feels like a fresh and unique accomplishment each time. And I am always finding new, game-breaking combos even after a thousand hours. And even though it's obviously designed this way, it always feels like the combo was truly a bug in the code and something that I ""discovered.""

And on that note about game-breaking combos. I think the funnest part of the game is the clan-synergizing (sorry, can't think of a better term). In each run, you choose two clans, where each clan has their own specialties. The game-breaking aspect comes when you take the specialty of one clan and magnify it with the specialty of the other. For example, one clan helps you draw many, many cards while another clan increases your attack and damage every time you play a card. Or one clan benefits from summoning and killing units, while another clan resurrects killed units and upgrades them.

The last thing I'll say is that the devs know exactly what makes this game good. Case in point: the DLC, the Last Divinity. This DLC adds a whole lot of gasoline to the fire: it gives you EVEN MORE control over your units and cards; allowing you to create even more absurd decks (with mega units, overpowered spells) to fight even more difficult enemies. All that said, if you're like me and would like to micromanage your way to the perfect deck, there really is no other option.",1630288912,1630288912,True,54,0,0.829470038414001465,0,True,False,False

All that changes is you unlock challenges where they take the exact same battles (over and over again :D ) only the monsters have extra difficulty so they get stronger.

Really wanted to like this game, but it is beyond ridiculous. Along with essentially doing the same battles over and over...if you build a good deck, as you progress the game compensates and your deck becomes instantly under-powered on the next tier. Just like other reviewers said...this game is essentially - build a good deck, do good for a round or two - then get destroyed.

It would seem literally the key to success is to try and make a stupid weak deck early on, keep it stupid, until trying to power up before the last 2 tiers. 

Not sure why people have rated this so high. Find it underwhelming and boring. It feels a lot like playing chess with the other player always making the same moves...over and over again! :D

This game makes even a dumbass like me feel good and smart at card games! It's great at making you feel OP as hell until it doesn't. Exploring the different available combinations and synergies between the different clans is absurdly satisfying. The DLC is also 100% worth it for the extra challenge and experimentations and possible-OP-ness (either for you or the enemy) it allows.

The deckbuilding layer is comprehensive and lends itself to interesting inter-faction combos and some solid long-term decision making. The strategic side is tight and well-designed, with crisp animations of your demons crushing their angelic enemies (hopefully). The overmap is well-designed: you can see ahead of you an infinite amount so if you're into planning (I am not) then you can map out your every move. All of your rewards are randomized, so typically you really just need to pick left or right path, and you gain the three little perks of that side. 

It ties together seamlessly, and I want to have a special HUGE SHOUTOUT to the world design team and the writers. The world is always in the background, told through flavor text on enemies, artifacts, and items. Most things, really. Everybody's got a little backstory, and it ties together beautifully. The world feels alive and vibrant in a way that you don't often see in video games. The Melting Remnant is my favorite- a faction of candle-folks who melt away and are reborn again.

+UPDATE: AMAZING DLC
+ Visually pleasing
+ no performance problems
+ next to no bugs found after 40h gameplay
+ cheap price, espacially for the hours of fun you can have with this
+ nice feeling of progress even after some won runs
+ daily challanges
+ devs tham seem to care
+ long term scaling difficulty
+ HUGE amounts of Contens/challanges for comletionists

CONS:
- wierd, timed multiplayer
- no private lobbys/ no way to play with your friends
- basline game is a bit too easy to be intresting ( UPDATE: No longer the case if you at least play with shards aka COV 1)
- scaling difficulty comes with more randomness, most of it is fine but some feels a bit cheap ( UPDATE: some of the key perks from COV difficulty scaling were reworked for mostly the better and are way less random! so no longer a negative!)
- some runs aren't winnable doesn't matter how good you play
- higher difficulties seem to limit the amount of stratagys viable (Update: with the new boss this one became better and worse at the same time: If your have an awesome run you finally have a fitting endboss that most of the time doesn't fall over after 2-3 turns, but if you don't and for many ""builds"" this is the case: you have next to no chance vs the new endboss)

UPDATE:
I don't know if these changes only apply if you have bought the dlc, but I did:
The game already was one of my favourites in the entire genre but the dlc with the new shards system made it a whole lot better!
They also rebalnced some old cards and some of the key covenant perks making the difficulty scaling not only better AND less random but also giving a whole other/additional way to make your games not only more difficult but more intresting aswell.
I do like the new endboss even tho you really need an exceptional amount of damage to win and you basicly need to dicide early on if you want/can try to get there.

-----

In Monster Train, you play 30-120 minute games where you build out a deck with creatures and spells to beat up evil birdies that are invading your train... of monsters...  

Every round you choose a main clan with a playable 'champion', and a sub-clan.  Your starting cards (creatures and spells) as well as most cards found along the way will be from these two clans.  The game + DLC (which I highly recommend) offer 6 different clans, each with 2 different champions, for a huuuge variety of possible combinations.  You unlock access to these clans as you play, as well as 25 difficulty levels that greatly increase the challenge - but only gradually, with a very nice difficulty curve due to the single minor hardship added by each  new difficulty.

Everything is (mostly) well balanced and extremely well-polished, with nice graphics, music/sound, and even a fun semi-story that you only discover by reading the battle quips and lore included on every card (TURN ON THE LORE TOOLTIPS.  DO IT NOW!)  The devs have also kept up with patches to fix things that are too out of whack and add even more content.

[b] IMPORTANT TIP:[/b]  For those who hate the idea of investing an hour into building the perfect deck and then losing due to a single mistaken decision, you can even restart a battle by quitting to the main menu and retrying - at higher levels this may be necessary unless you can tolerate a lot of punishment.   Of course, the RNG and deck order is determined at the start of the battle and remains mostly the same when you reload, so you still need to avoid poor life choices as you build and upgrade your deck.   However, this can help you learn the best way to position units, or simply retry a battle when you accidentally play your spells in the wrong order - without losing an hour of progress.   This also allows you to play the higher difficulty levels as sort of a 'strategy-puzzle-rpg', figuring out which placement of units/spells will let you solve a given battle.  (Yes, some people will see this as evil savescumming cheatery, but use it or don't at your own discretion to whatever amount you feel is fair - it's a single player game, so do whatever you find to be fun!)

Story: 2/10 
Similar to slay the spire, there's only a brief overall story-line. However, the encounters feel extra bland to me and there are very limited unique encounters. Thus, repetitions happen a lot quicker and there's less excitement after a few playthroughs.

Character/Art: 6/10 
Monster's trains ""monsters"" all look fairly generic to me. There isn't a specific character I find that looks incredibly unique. 
If other players ask me what main characters there are, I just have a vague memory of ""well there's a red one, then a green one..""and so forth. The same goes for bosses where there is a lack of uniqueness and I never found myself immersed or shocked by one of their designs.

And make no mistake, it's a very good game. But if you're reading the reviews you're probably looking for something a bit more informative than ""DIS GAME GUD"", no?

If that's the case, then let me start off by saying that the only real 'bad' things in this game are:
 - it has this mobile game aesthetic 
 - there really is a lot to learn. The skill ceiling is incredibly high and it takes a very long time to reach it - even though I beat the main game (Covenant 25) I'm 100% sure there's still more for me to learn, and there are expert challenges to boot

There. Now all I'm going to say is good things, but I'll also attempt to dive a little deeper.

[h1]Breaking the game: The Game[/h1]
Obviously, this is a roguelike deckbuilder. What makes this one special is it's 'breakability' and it's relationship to being broken. Let me explain.

Each card can be upgraded twice (thrice in special cases). There are 'low tier upgrades' and 'high tier upgrades' (the latter are, for example, making the monster attack one more time or the spell appearing in your next hand after you've used it, making it possible to cast it every turn). As you can probably imagine, those upgrades when coupled with particular cards can totally 'break' the game. As in, the challenge seems to disappear. You think you're all set. But no, turns out that what was game-breaking up to now, is barely enough for the upcoming part. So you build your deck further: you duplicate the card. Ok, two game breaking cards, this gotta be enough, right? Well, yes. Up until it isn't. And so on.

After you beat the final boss once, you unlock ""covenant"" - small incrementing increases in difficulty after every win. This is the main progression of the game. You will notice that what you thought OP before is barely cutting it now. You constantly have to be on the lookout for making the best out of your build. ""Forcing"" a build almost always end in a disaster: you have to keep going with the flow. And the difficulty curve is very pleasant. There's one spike around Cov-19 (heh), but apart from that it always feels fair.

[h1]The music and the lore[/h1]
Music is probably not why you're playing this, but let me just say that this game's music has no business being as good as it is. It's very musically complex, and there's a very nice use of leitmotifs here and there. This is not one of those games where you'll just turn off the music and rock your own playlist.

Now for the more important part: The lore. You're on a train, trying to save the last shard of hellfire from the invading forces of the Winged (think angels). That doesn't mean you're the bad guys - the Winged are shown as ruthless, cunning and traitorous. The hellborne (demons - you) are shown as a very complex bunch of many clans, living in something resembling harmony. But that's not even the lore that I'm talking about.

Every card has its own description, clearly all authored by the same individual. Who are they? The game very nonchalantly ignores such questions, leaving you to think for yourself. The characters - in particular the bosses and your champions - often say stuff. Some of those tidbits throw your entire understanding of the game world into question. Some unique events also can be very revelatory. And most importantly - the game -does not care-. It's all treated as inconsequential chatter. You're just supposed to get your damn train to the final ring of hell. And that's what makes it so appealing.

I can't stress this enough: it's GREAT. It's Dark Souls approach, except taken a step further. And the lore itself is incredibly interesting as well. It's filled with characters and events that have no real appearance in the game, all echoes of history. Or... maybe that's not even true either?

[h1]Endless unlocks[/h1]
To wrap things up: there are so, so many unlocks. There are 5 clans of hell (initially only 2 are available), all of them have their own EXP levels, and every level up you gain new cards, new artifacts, and at level 5 a new champion. You always play as 2 clans at once - one primary and one secondary. That determines what sort of cards and artifacts you can find. That means there's quite a few combinations - 5 clans x 4 secondary = 20 combinations. With the DLC there's a 6th clan, so there's 6 x 5 = 30. (And no, having clan A primary and B secondary is not the same as B primary and A secondary - the balance is different and you play as different champions)

Well, here you go. It really is a no brainer, even if you're not that fond of deckbuilder roguelikes. It's just a damn fine game.",1627480901,1627480901,True,23,1,0.759808957576751709,0,True,False,False

As a huge fan of Slay the Spire, which introduced me to this genre, I didn't have a lot of hope that any game thereafter would give me the same sense of excitement and dedication as it did. That was until I played Monster Train. One of the things I appreciate the most about Monster Train is that there's always something new to explore: some combination of clans, cards, or some other game-breaking combos. I didn't really feel that about Slay the Spire beyond the initial leveling of the 3 main characters (and eventually 4th). Once I gave up on ever defeating the heart (is it even possible?) I never felt like there was anything else out there driving me to continue to play the game. With Monster Train I feel like there is always something to do--some combo to complete, covenant rank to unlock, or expert challenge to beat. All of this is accompanied by a logbook that clearly shows you what you have achieved and what you still need to complete. I love this concept--as a perfectionist in games I really want to see all of it lit up. I never had something like it in Slay the Spire, so the addition of it in Monster Train is really what keeps me coming back game after game. My one criticism of the game is its level of difficulty. I either know that I'm going to lose the game by floor 3 OR I think I have an awesome thing going and then get totally destroyed when I get to the last boss. This is similar to what frustrated me about Slay the Spire's final heart.

There's surprisingly few decisions in a run of Monster Train that aren't obvious and little need to consider the odds or take risk/reward gambles. As a simple example, cards taht make you draw will increase your draw for next turn, so you don't need to consider the chances oif what you will draw this turn and if a draw card is worth it.

Further, there are only a few viable builds/archetypes (often just one, with some variations) for each clan pair, which means you know going in roughly what you're shooting for, instead of needing to cobble together a deck along the way, which can make it feel ""less RNG"". I'm not convinced it's *actually* less RNG once you know what you're doing in each respective game, but Monster Train makes it harder to blame the game for your own failures.

If all that sounds appealing, then go for it. Monster Train's graphics, music, and setting won't dissapoint and there's still some strategy in optimizing your runs for win streaks.

Slay the Spire is probably a better designed game overall, and more balanced. But, Monster Train is more fun to me because of how incredibly strong runs can get. In Slay the Sprie, your cards and deck get slowly better, adding up to a winning deck. In Monster Train these power curves are just steeper, you can get a card that just completely shifts how strong your deck is. I love that aspect.",1626975279,1626975279,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In my opinion, Monster Train is a superb card battler. Instead of a single health pool that you have to zealously guard, you summon units on your train to defend your health pool. Each battle the units reset, allowing you to build up unit combinations to defend against the waves of enemies that threaten you. Instead of locking into a single playstyle when you start a run, you pick two clans (decks) and can develop a strategy with the synergies. Each deck has some really powerful characteristics, so you really get the power fantasy feeling from your first 3 runs, as opposed to StS where it takes like 15 runs to finally feel accomplished.",1626670099,1626670099,True,5,0,0.528780758380889893,0,True,False,False

There are 5 clans in total, and for each run, you need to select a primary clan and an allied clan, where the primary clan decides your champion. That gives you 20 clan combinations to choose from. Each clan can be levelled up to lvl 10, with each level unlocking new cards, and when a clan reaches lvl 6, you unlock its exiled champion as well as its exiled starter card. 

For a standard run, there are 25 Covenant Ranks available, which basically decide the difficulty of each run. Each additional Covenant Rank adds a new rule to make the game more difficult, such as giving enemies more health or adding deadweight cards to your deck, and so on. You must win a run on one Covenant Rank in order to unlock the next Covenant Rank. It doesn't matter which clan combination you use, and you are free to replay any unlocked Covenant Rank. The game doesn't force you to play on the highest available Covenant Rank. When you first play the game, you start with Covenant Ranks turned off, and you only unlock Covenant 1 by beating the game for the first time, so technically there are 26 difficulty levels if you count the default difficulty with no Covenants. Beating the game on Covenant 25 will unlock Expert Challenges. It took me 80+ hours just to beat Covenant 25 for the first time, and I've only ever beaten it twice. I haven't even attempted any of the Expert Challenges yet.

Apart from the standard mode, you have 3 challenge modes to choose from: Hell Rush, Daily Challenge and Community Challenges. I've only tried the Daily Challenge, and it's pretty fun playing those randomised challenges with some wacky rules added. Daily Challenges have a fixed difficulty of Covenant 1, so they are fairly easy to beat, but the real challenge comes from trying to get the highest score to top the leaderboard.

All of the above combined results in a game with amazing replayability! You might have noticed that I didn't mention how the gameplay works, but that's because I don't think I can do it justice! All I can say is that it's a turn-based strategy roguelike card battler, and it's fun as hell!",1625504607,1626618313,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR: If you're considering buying this or Slay the Spire, buy this.

I got into Monster Train on a recommendation and loved it, then got Slay the Spire because hey, it has amazing reviews and it started the deckbuilder/roguelike genre! About half an hour in my jaw had almost hit the floor - I was shocked by how poorly StS compared to this game. It's improved on nearly every basic feature: more exciting items! More character choices! Better turn flow! I credit the StS devs with inventing a new genre, but hey...I'd rather buy the new and improved version than the first stab at the concept.

Monster Train is perfect for strategy gamers and trading card players (I'm a longtime Magic fan). It might be hard to beat the bosses if you don't have much experience with card games specifically, I'm not sure - Slay the Spire might be the better game for new players. But MT has it beat on depth of mechanics and overall quality of life. 

The one major drawback is the lack of boss variety - you ultimately ""beat"" the game by beating the final boss 25 times, which is a 30+ hour time commitment and starts to feel repetitive (although they add modifiers to the gameplay as you go). I'd really like some sort of built-in Endless Mode or just more boss variety to make for a longer, crazier experience.",1625940648,1625940701,True,3,0,0.509620130062103271,0,True,False,False

The art style feels a little simplistic at times, but the design of the factions and the world do a lot of heavy lifting to make up for it.

Their poor game play design choosing a short campaign means that you don't have enough time to bend the shape of your deck to one that suits your vision, forcing your to rely heavily on the very few random node rolls and random results to offer you what you need to fit your particular cookie cutter.

Worse is as if in acknowledgment of this games lack of luster the modding community is tiny. I have no idea how it gets reviews as good as it does.

I found myself actually enjoying this game more because it wasn't as difficult as Slay the Spire to start off with, but I can definitely feel the difficulty creeping up with the ""Covenant"" levels (this game's version of Ascension). Somehow, the losses just don't feel as bad as the losses I get in StS, and I'm more inclined to jump back into another run.  This is further incentivized with the way you can combine two different clans/factions as well as having a different champions for each of these factions.

Firstly, the game offers a lot of different combinations. You pick your main deck which has a powerful, free and scaling champion unit you get at the start of every combat. You then pick a secondary faction which opens up a roster of card and game play mechanics exclusive to them such as unit upgrades, card upgrades and artifacts to augment your abilities. Your goal is to find syngeries and abuse the hell out of them. In the base game, there's 5 factions (an extra sixth is included in the dlc), and all the factions have an alternate side which replace the starting card and champion. Furthermore, the champion units themselves have 3 different paths to upgrade as you progress. Admittedly, some of these are more niche, less viable and ultimately less reliable than others which becomes more apparent as you scale difficulty. Although, this only mildly undermines just how much the game gives you to play with in terms of content.

The general gameplay loop is you pick one of two paths before each combat, get stronger and then fight. What makes this so crucial is that the game gives you near complete information of what rewards you'll get in the future. At any time you can scroll further down the map to see what your options are, including the kind of flavour the end boss is and what his mechanics are. There are some fixed reward types and general flow to each run and unlike slay the spire, there is absolutely no negative events to worry about. You feel completely in control of your decisions and most of your failures will be your own rather than at the mercy of the game. Certain rewards can also be skipped and will give you some gold to use as compensation such as cards and artifacts. Even better is that the game generously gives multiple draw pick 1 reward types so you always get strong choices to make.

Before each combat you get the choice to add an additional modifier to your fight to get extra goodies. The DLC also adds shards which you can take to get more rewards at the cost of fighting randomly buffed enemies depending on many shards you've willingly taken on. Most of my failed runs are out of making bad calls without consulting what information the game was giving me OR by biting off way more than I could chew. This is what makes the game so immensely fun.

Combat is fairly simple. You control 3 levels and a core level. You plonk down dudes to defend and play cards to buff or kill foes. Enemies pop in the bottom floor and will ascend a level after each round of fighting until they die or reach the core. Once you take too much core damage, you lose. After you end your turn, your enemies attack FIRST then you. You'll need to make clever use of your units and cards to either mitigate the attrition or plan around it. After some rounds of combat you'll fight a boss who will make his way to the core and the cycle repeats. The game will tell you who dies and damage before you end the turn so you know how badly you're losing or well you're winning so you can better make decisions.

Finally, after a successful run you'll unlock a new covenant level up to the max of 25. These add additional handicaps to keep the game challenging as you push through to new heights. The first covenant in particular adds random cards to your deck from your factions as a way to incentivise you trying them out or making a strategy with those draws in mind.

Monster train is hands down the most cleverly designed card games. It's addictive, challenging and all the while makes it so most losses will boil down to you rather than bad RNG. You can't ask for much better than this. Even if the main game gets tiresome, there's the daily challenge and mutators to make runs more wacky. An absolute gem packed full of content.",1625753725,1625768172,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The comparison to StS is inevitable, so let's get it out of the way: as a fan of both, this game feels a lot more... dense, which is not to say it's harder (I haven't reached covenant 25 but ascension 20 in StS is pretty hard), but while the base systems feel similar, StS is a lot more streamlined. Where StS has one shop, Monster Train has three. Where StS has 4 room types, MT has.. 7? 8? Something like that. Where StS has 3 classes/unique deck pools, MT has 6, and every run combines two of them, and has a unique champion on top of it. Whereas StS has your main character fight enemies, MT has you engaging in this tower defense mini game with a lot of interesting positioning elements... You get the point. This leads to a game that just feels like ""a lot"".

Personally I prefer the simpler, more stripped down style of StS (not to say it is a simple game, StS has A LOT of content), but this game and its complexity has a certain charm, and works surprisingly well. The decks feel orthogonal enough in unique ways, that combining them feels interesting and good and allows ridiculous combos and makes you want to try all of them, while forcing the player to adapt to the cards offered. The champions feel really good, they're often strong enough to allow you to create a strategy around them, while not completely eclipsing your other cards. Overall I feel this game must have been a heck to balance but it just feels really good, when you get a good deck going you feel really powerful but the enemies still feel potent and close to overwhelming you.

In the end, I like this game a lot and feel all its moving parts work surprisingly well together. I would recommend to fans of the genre and people who like somewhat dense games that you can dive really deep into.",1625749512,1625749512,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Comparatively, at least at the default level, Monster Train is a much easier game. Path choices are a straightforward dichotomy each time (although the choices between the two have more different consequences so are sometimes a difficulty call). More to the point. I have played dozens of runs of Monster Train and lost only a handful of times, whereas with Slay the Spire I'm pretty sure I've lost the majority of the runs I've attempted. That being said, this perhaps makes Monster Train a more favorable game for relative beginners in this genre (or someone you want to introduce to the genre).

What stands out to me about Monster Train, though, is the customization options for your play experience. The many different factions with different playstyles are interesting, especially since you combine two strategies for any one run, with different ""Champion"" options which in turn have different ability tree choices, but also different build style options even within one particular pairing. This is far wider variety than the 4 classes of Slay the Spire even considering the distinct build styles you can pursue within each of those classes. You can also increase the difficulty of any particular encounter in exchange for greater rewards. And like Slay the Spire you can ""ascend"" the overall difficulty. I'm sure there are other options that I'm forgetting as well.

This review centers on a comparison with Slay the Spire, but that's a compliment.

I find that monster train is a bit more chill to play and more fun to watch because there's actually some action going on on screen along with a great soundtrack and you dont really have to cycle through your entire deck and make a 100 decisions to win. Its way easier than slay the spire in terms of beating the real final boss atleast and i think thats a bit of a problem.

I managed to beat him in one day in and i imagine some people would just quit playing right there because why continue playing and unlocking stuff when you've already beaten the final boss right? So i got into that dilemma myself but decided to continue playing and im at rank 15 cov atm. Its getting a bit harder. It would be cool if there was a ""real"" real final boss in this game though XD

The only problem I've had is that the more you ramp up the difficulty, the more likely it is that your success hinges less on your tactics/knowledge of the game and more on RNG giving you the cards you need to succeed(or even just drawing your cards in the right order).

""Monster Train"" is not too hard to beat, but not too easy either. The idea and the graphics are amazing.
The concept is a tower (in this case train) defense with deck building. The use of different races give lots of opportunities and card combinations. You always use 2 of the 5 (with DLC 6) races.
You can raise the difficulty by doing challenges or by ascending in the covenant path.

It still has PLENTY of challenge if that last sentence made you worry, as not only are your opportunities to get cards more limited, but the level of your train AND the front-middle-back placing of your units can make or break a boss encounter.

There are so many different possibilities given how you can mix clans.  The clans you choose even influence what relics you can get AND what unit upgrades you can get (besides the pool of ""Clanless"" general units and upgrades.  Each of the major bosses have 3-4 different abilities they can have, and you can even increase the difficulty of each encounter between bosses for more rewards.

I do think there are some cards in the game that need to be refined because they aren't very good (in MY opinion), and it'd be nice if you could have a completely hybrid Champion (there are 3 possible upgrade trees for each Champion, and you can only have 3 ranks in one, or a 2/1 or 1/2 split between two different trees), but there's already just SO MUCH POSSIBILITY.

- The replayability is super well made, with the starting cards being random and with so many clans to choose from, you have a huge number of combinations that will keep you entertained for a long time.

The clans are super charming and feel very unique, I'm having a blast trying stuff out in the daily challenges as well as the community challenges.

However, I think that one of the best indicators of a good game is that it gets more fun as it gets more difficult. This game fails that test in a rather epic fashion. 

Firstly, the decks seem to get worse the more cards that you get. The increasing number of cards means that you never seem to get the right combination of cards that were already present in the starter deck. It is very frustrating that you cannot curate your deck. I feel I should feel stronger with better cards, not weaker!

Secondly, difficulty mechanic is pretty bad. It simply adds more difficult 'facets' as you progress without adding any new mechanics. So as your deck gets worse, the game gets harder until it feels more frustrating than fun.

 Finally, the wormkin expansion deck just seems worse than almost any other race. It's just disappointing. Certain mechanics can be powerful, but they require such specific cards so that it most often just falls on its face.

I cannot even end the program in task manager. The only solution is to restart the PC. I encounter this problem on daily basis. Normally after first restart then I am able to play the game. Luckily I have my window on SSD so restart only took around 10 sec or so.

I have the latest NVIDIA driver and I am using RTX 3070 so I dont think it has anything to do with the GPU.

Today, I restarted my PC 3 times and the game still refused to start. I guess this is the final straw and I decided to uninstall the game and post this review. 

I have not encounter this issue with any other game.

I hope the developer will be able to fix this bug. I would love to play this game again.

------------------------
Purchased the DLC and it seems that I no longer encounter the problem of starting this game. Not sure what has changed. I did updated the NVIDIA driver to the latest one (version 466.27).

It is a roguelite deckbuilder, which means you start a run with a set of weak cards and get new cards or upgrade your existing cards during the run.

You'll be given a random set of upgrades or cards to choose from, but your choices determine which sets of upgrades you might get. The execution is really smooth though, it is even better than it sounds.

The only real negative is that the DLC is quite unbalanced, with the new clan being by far the worst, the difficulty too high, and the balance being pretty far off the mark.

I had a lot of fun discovering synergies across the different groups of monsters, there's wild variety between and within the groups, and you can run into some really interesting interactions with enemies. That said, in my experience, skill can only carry you so far. 

As with Slay the Spire, you can eventually hit an RNG wall that means you're going to repeat runs ad nauseum because you didn't get some artifact you need or you didn't pull one of the cards required for high damage attacks against the increasingly difficult bosses. Certain groups, eg the stygian guard, tend to develop more slowly than others, and have trouble keeping up with the curve of the enemies. It sucks to stomp the first encounters and then get completely dominated by the last one, then try again, fail, try again, fail, and keep doing that for like 10 hours.

I am not a roguelite player. I am not in to deck building. I don't know what made me try out this game but I'm sure glad I did. Forget these reviewers that say ""Who wants to play the same game over and over again?"" It's not! Every run I've done so far has been new and challenging. Every time you click you are making a decision with consequences. Most of those consequences you will feel the weight of at some point. 

Keep passing up a card because it doesn't appeal to you? Pick it! Pick it and watch how you play the game change. My first round with Morsel Units...abysmal. My third round with them....one of the best runs I've ever had. 

Kicking Fel's ass never fails to satisfy me. I love the sound design in this game. There are moments when all seems lost and you throw a hail mary out there in hopes of doing something useful and it changes the entire course of the round. Sometimes when I sit down to play I have a run that is exploding with artifacts that either help or hinder me. Sometimes I have runs where I barely pick up any artifacts at all and I have to really rely on numbers and strategy to succeed. I love the choosing which side of the rails to visit after each battle. Need a little pyre health? Or risk the health to go shopping and beef up your warriors? Good stuff.

Like StS you follow a path of somewhat your own selection (in the vein of FTL) selecting what way along a map (or in this case rail) you want to go, you can see more though in Monster Train what awaits you than in Slay the Spire as far as which fork in the road will lead to a shop to increase your spells vs. increase your monsters, however there is still choices to be made and you can still pick the wrong route.

Also Monster Train adds a neat twist of giving you three levels two defend and (at least as far as what I saw during my hour and a half play time) seven waves of mobs to fight against, each with different twist on them.   Some may half you buffs and debuffs, some you may have to kill a particular mob to avoid multistrike and so on.   All in all it adds more tactical depth than StS to some extent.

I can't believe I waited so long to try the game out.  I purchased it a while back but it has been sitting in my backlog and I finally got around to trying it and I am glad I did.  I didn't have any game breaking errors, however for some reason on the opening cinematic it went laggy and I thought it was going to lock up.  I didn't close out and retry and had no further problems past that graphical or otherwise so I think it was just a fluke.   I was on a machine with a 1060 GTX 3GB with up to date GeForce drivers at the time.      

Anyway, otherwise the game was a blast and I look forward to playing more of it.

If you like ""Slay the Spire"" game, you should definitely try this one too. And vise-versa, though I have feeling this game is in many ways superior. I will compare them for you:

+ shorter game sessions: just 9 battles;
+ each battle can be easily replayed (unless crystal is destroyed) by exiting to main menu and loading the game;
+ battles are more ""strategic"": 3 floors and few waves before fighting mini-/maxy-/end-boss;
+ no ""bad"" events, anything what happens is either good or can be skipped;
+ ""smart"" shuffle cards: there is guaranteed unit accompany the hero, similar cards aren't bundled, etc.;
+ no need to build ""perfect rotation"" decks, it's relatively easy to remove cards and upgrade, though both are limited;
+ there are just 2 path to select one after each fight;
+ there are many things to master after beating the game (which for me is to complete all the achievements).

Random can still hurt, especially on a higher difficulties, when starting deck is bloated with mostly poor cards. Removing cards is easy. Upgrading units or spells cards is always a hard choice as well as maintaining a crystal health.

First, the story. Hell has frozen over and you are tasked with saving it by delivering the last spark via a pyre crystal inside the Monster Train. It's not gonna be easy, as the forces of heaven are trying to stop you from reaching your destination. Different factions of Hell are coming together to assist you, can you save Hell?

The gameplay looks complicated, but is really simple to grasp. There are five factions to choose from (but you start off with 2), each with their own champions. You choose 2 per run, a main faction, and supporting faction. This changes your starting deck of cards that consist of units, spells, buffs, etc. With each stop you can use acquired gold to upgrade units, spells, your champion (every few stations), and more. There are branching pathways you have to decide from to give your deck varying advantages (or disadvantages). 

Combat is fun as you have 3 floors you have to defend. Enemies come in from the bottom floor, and work their way up one floor at a time each turn. You have to place your units carefully and stop the enemy from destroying the pyre. Each faction plays differently which adds soooo much fun to the gameplay. One is all about brute strength, another is about healing and sustaining hits, the other is about casting spells, and the last two are super unique! One is about using these tiny throwaway units that are used to be consumed by your other units to make them stronger, and the last faction gives you strong units who burn away after a set amount of turns. Each faction also has two different champions, with different upgrade trees that you can mix and match. Needless to say, the combinations are plentiful and makes for very fun and varied runs!
If this seems overwhelming, do not worry. The game does an excellent job of slowly introducing new cards to you as you keep playing. The first few runs will seem nearly impossible to beat, but as you keep playing and unlocking new units, spells, artifacts, etc., you'll start beating back the forces of heaven with new vigor!

Feel like the game is getting too easy and want a challenge? No worries, you can take on special challenges with each stage, there are challenge modes to play, and you can compare your stats with you friends and others on the leaderboards!

Gripes with the game? I have none. Even when I lose runs, I find myself having a great time and eagerly waiting to try the run again. Heck, I'm at the point where I choose random and just work with whatever the game gives me just because it's fun to challenge myself and see how far I can make it.

Final verdict? If you want a strategic deck-building game or if you liked Slay the Spire, then you NEED to play this game. It's so addictive and fun that I can't put it down. There is even a DLC faction that adds a new spin on everything (but I suggest waiting til you unlock more things before tackling that). So stop reading this, and get on the train to save Hell!

This review has been a long time coming.

Monster Train is a game about the last denizens of Hell travelling to the source of the heat. Citizens of Heaven are attempting to stop them by any means necessary, and (With the recent addition of The Last Divinity), it created a time loop where the same thing repeats over and over again. It's up to you to help your chosen clan fight through Heaven's Finest, picking up creatures and critters along the way to assist you in that task.

What kind of playstyle do you prefer? Do you prefer the hyper-aggressive style of the Hellhorned, Devils and Imp with Armour and Rage? Do you enjoy being a tactical healer, the Wildwood being your bread and butter with healing and regen? Would you much rather a tactical onslaught with your spells? In that case, you should pick the Water-Bound Stygian, who have Incant and Frostbite to build units up over time or push the enemies towards their graves. Would you rather a virtual army of buffs and stat gain? Snag yourself the Umbra, who focus around the Morsels and Constructs of the mines. If you'd enjoy a go at a fast-paced, all-around power, then the Melting Remnants have your back- From the slums of Dregs to the Vanity of the rich, they all focus around Burnout and how to counter it. Or, if you want to play with fire and enjoy watching it burn, the Wurmkin are fit to the nines with Inspire and Etch and Crystals abound.

It's up to you how you want to play, and it's up to you who joins your train. There's a fair amount of dicerolling involved, but when it slots together just right and you get that victory, it never gets old- it's like a rush of dopamine, directly to the system. You deserve to feel that victory, because you worked to earn it.

Which brings us to why I've played Monster Train for so long. As of writing, I am 171 hours in with all achievements- however, I am NOWHERE near finished with the game, about 50% of the way in. A game like Monster Train has Slay the Spire in its blood, but enough differences to make it feel unique and fresh. So many units, so many cards assigned to each clan, as well as many events and modifiers that can keep you playing for a long, long time.

And it never gets dull. That's something I was worried about- I was worried that around Covenant 10 (The game's version of levels of difficulty), I was going to get sick of repeating the same thing over and over, but that simply never came up. Sure, I got frustrated. I lost several times in a row, would rage quit, come back to it in a week; not to mention the new final boss is COMPLETE ASS in difficulty scaling, but besides all of that, I never broke with the game and stopped enjoying it.

The effects of their mana wings, and movements are well-done and the auras of light around their bodies or from their wings feels dramatic and powerful.

It's very addictive and fun though very challenging once attempting to clear higher tiers of runs.

 If I had a complaint it would be that there is not much incentive to try the ""pvp"" mode which is really just a race vs other players against the ai. Multiplayer really needs a boost of some sort - Maybe some co-op or rewards that break away from the main concept in an interesting and/or fun way.

 I bought the Divinity expansion and it really opens the game up a bit but also forces me to play segregated from those who don't have the expansion unless I de-activate the expansion. The purchasable faction offers more variety while not really giving me an unbalanced advantage so why can I not flex my pretty Wyrmkin in general population? It's a small complaint though.

Pros:
1. Quirky, friendly vibrant artstyle.
2. New spin on the roguelite tower defence genre, 3 lanes (floors) to manage and defend but keeps it incredibly simplistic.
3. This game has a lot of charm, great freedom of choice and a massive selection of cards.
4. Customisable playstyle, no run is ever the same and multiple Monster Factions (Clans) to choose from.
5. All aboard, Choo choo!

Cons:
1. There is no story line to the game just pure gameplay.
2. The gameplay loop felt a tiny bit slow, there is always the setup period before things start happening.
3. A lot of the cards can be quite useless compared to others, some balancing issues and tweaks needed.
4. I was not as addicted to this as I have been other card game roguelites.

Overall:
Monster train was a treat to playthrough as every faction, they all play vastly different from each other in terms of mechanics. I just felt it wasn't as addictive as it should have been and I can't quite place my finger on what was missing. 
All in all great game and worth playing if this genre is your thing.

There's definite balance stories where certain champions are VASTLY better than others (requiring less things to come together or just practically carrying their side by themselves) but they're all playable and there's nice mixtures.

The constant randomness is both a joy and at the same time can make late cov25 play feel like it has a 20% up/down based on if the dice like you.  A variety of champions or setups have aligned artifacts that are significant force multipliers for them, so there's definitely a level of fishing for them.  Getting the wrong third tier enchantment showing up can also considerably sway the flow of a run.   It lends to skill and awareness of the options (what do you do with bad hands or when not to take challenges) but there's absolutely an unevenness between runs at the same difficulty.

Playing the Imp Queen?  Well this run we won't spawn any high rarity Imps and you'll run into quick or multistrike.  Playing a heavy hitter?  How about endless regularly?  Totally happens.

    [*]Some clans are certainly straightforward but I was surprised how diverse the later ones you unlock are. They are fun as hell and allow you to have a very diverse gameplay since you can combine clans in your runs.

Varied game play through different factions, each faction having two classes. Play as the hard hitting Hellborned, the regenerative thorny Awoken, the magical and frosty Stygian Guard, the ravenous and gluttonous Umbra or the waxy and ephemeral Melting Remnant. Hell has frozen over, let's thaw it out.

Game is well executed, challenging, and offers 'speed chess' style competitive game play, daily challenges, as well as the ability to challenge others based on your first run of a seed.  I have not yet picked up the expansion so I can't speak much to it yet. Design your own run and challenge others.

If you like rogue-like deck builders, give this one a shot.

Scoring mechanic leaves a little to be desired. Opt in for all the hard stuff, beat the boss on the first endless wave, and save your coin and you get a high score. It is not how I would have implemented scoring but its simple and effective.  Some factions have an unbalanced advantage via score due to their cash generating options.

On a scale of 0-10, with a 5 being recommend buy and you'll get minimum 1 Hour/$ spent, this one is a solid 8. (Shout out to Schmug Marfman for the price metric).

Bonus points for being walk away capable for the primary game mode.  Those of you gamer parents or low key gamers that can't devote 1-2 hours non stop attention will be pleased with this style of game play. It can be quite addictive though.  Stats are very well executed, comparing you to your Steam Friends.

So I go on playing, and I finally beat the last boss and,.... That's it? I get a score recap screen and I am invited to play on the next level (or ""covenant rank"").
Okay....Whatever, I keep playing because I'm thinking, maybe there are hidden bosses or narrative rewards, so let's see....

It starts a bit too easy if you're familiar with StS, and although it automatically upgrades you to the next difficulty on every win, you feel like you're always running ahead in the first alliance rounds. That is until you reach a wall of difficulty because on every new difficulty the games just keeps upping the enemies' health and damage, giving you handicaps, and putting so much garbage cards into your deck that toward the end you have little more strategy than turning your deck into a machine gun of low-quality spells.

You can feel tempted to try to specialize in one strategy and try to refine it, but out of the 8 leaders the base game offers, there is one that makes the game very easy with a 75% win rate, and the seven other are extremely difficult to bring to victory after a certain level of difficulty.

As much as I dislike StS, I have to recognize it's pretty smart in the mechanics department, the enemies offer many challenging problems to solve and your own cards can offer you (when RNGeesus allows it) a lot of different tactics to overcome.
Here sadly, it's just a game of numbers, you mostly buff your allies and debuff the enemy on every round, and you spend alot of time doing mental arithmetics to the point where it can become a bit tedious.
The enemy systematically puts tank enemies on the front line with huge health and armor, and hides the big hitters and buffing units on the back line with low health but huge damage.
Some enemy units or bosses will stop your run dead in its tracks if you are unlucky enough to have them appear (like that very hard to kill last boss assistant, which reduce all your mana to zero on every turn).

The core gameplay of MT is a tower defense game, and most of the time it feels more like you're playing tower defense with randomized units than a deckbuilder game. There is something very repetitive and boring about it. Just big numbers against big numbers.
Every level plays like a round with every unit attacking in turn and is resolved at the end with the ascension of the surviving enemies to the higher floor.

I REALLY don't like the grind you have to do to unlock every card and artifact. It was acceptable in StS because it was very short. Here, it took me about 60 hours to unlock all the cards and artifacts of the game, which prevented me from deploying some strategies because the cards were hidden.

The graphics are okay, but I don't know why they decided to make parts of the level in 3D. It doesn't look as good as if it was all 2D.
The music is very nice, but a bit too present at times and I found myself muting it.

In conclusion, it manages to be even more autistic and unfun than StS, which is some kind of achievement....

Not quite as complex as Slay the Spire and does not require trial and error like most roquelike games to forehand knowledge of what to be expecting so you don't get absolutely rekt out of nowhere for not knowing.

The game has 25 challenge difficulties with handicaps you can increasingly climb to with a successful run on a highest challenge level you've unlocked. On the most part the game is fun until either you grow tired of it or if you're like me feel salty I lose certain runs because the RNG elements didn't offer me the opportunity to draft the necessary pieces of cards to win a run. 

To elaborate further to win a successful run in this game: You need basically to meet 3 conditions:
1) Enough damage output from  your units to kill enemy tanks fast enough
2) Someway to deal direct damage or AOE damage to consistently get rid of Glass Cannon units in the enemies back line behind their tank
3) Some method of consistently tanking the damage output  from the aforementioned enemy Glass Cannon units if you can't kill them before they attack your units.

The basics of the game is you choose a primary clan and secondary clan and throughout the run you draft cards and artifacts (passive items with support effects) predominantly from the the clans chosen. Unfortunately the synergy between certain clans don't work as well and so RNG can determine your successful your run can be. Of course you can always just continuously do runs with only the 2 clans of your choice that synergize well...but what is the fun in that?

8/10. A solid game but RNG elements can still ruin your day.

Unlike Slay the Spire, you do not play as ""your character"". Instead, think of all the characters as minions, and yourself as the ""Boss"". If your minions do not stop the enemies ascend through 3 floors, the enemies then attack you directly and damage you. 

Every faction offers different minions, spells, and mechanics. 
Some focus on healing and buffing, others on giving your minions temporary health (Armour) and damage, others focus on using LOTS of throw-away minions that they can remake again and again, and those minions grow stronger with every remake. 

The spells are a nice advance from Slay the Spire. You have the standard fare of damage dealing, healing, buffing, and debuffing cards, you have cards that have strong effects but require you discard cards, you have cards that affect your minions and the enemy minions, there's an evne that lets you build your own card from a selection, and there's cards that grow permanently (as in during that run, not between runs), as well as cards you can only play in specific floors, albeit there's only 1 or 2 of those. Overall, a very good selecton of effects, and quite a few that allow you to really strategize your turn.

Without the DLC, the base game has, basically, NG+25, as every successful run unlocks a new difficulty, with different effects. Up to Level 25. the DLC adds a new, tough endboss, a new mechanic, and new cards, as well as a whole new faction to play as.

I whole-heartedly recommend it. 

The game is very stable (for me, I have not had a single crash or freeze in all my hours). I did have two instances of the game not reacting for a few seconds, but I cannot reproduce those.

The difficulty curve is smooth, the factions you play as are all very interesting, the learning curve is not too steep, but you will repeatedly find yourself thinking ""Hmm, I wonder if this combination works"" and it will work more often than not.

I [b]love[/b] this game. From the gameplay to the crazy synergies to the visual design. Everything in this game amazes me.

So what is Monster Train about? As I wrote above, it's a deckbuilding rogue-like. This means you start with a weak starter deck and during your run you add different cards to the deck that make it stronger. The runs are always randomized and you never know what kind of cards or enemies you will get and the idea is to make the best out of what the game gives you.
In monster Train you don't have a single character but instead have to defend a train from boarding enemies. You summon units on one of three floors and cast spells on either your units or the enemies. Each round a wave of enemies spawns on the lowest floor, you get a chance to play your cards and once you end the round, the enemies will attack, then your units attack, then the enemies will move up one floor. This repeats until you win or loose the fight. To win you have to kill all waves but the last wave contains a strong boss which attacks until every unit is dead. You loose if you cannot defeat the enemies and they reach and destroy the pyre room which reprents your health bar.
Each run has exactly 8 battles with 3 being major boss battles which have fixed bosses with different variant types. The finbal boss has 4 different variants and during the start of the run the game will tell you what type of variant he will be so you can build your deck around it.

Cards in monster train have two different upgrade slots which can be filled with upgrades bought in shops. Spells and units have each their own unique upgrades. Spells can cost less energy to play, monsters generally get stat improvements. 
During your run you will stop at different rings and each ring has a selection of two routes, each with its own rewards. This way you can decide if you want to take healing, meet a shop, remove cards from your deck and more. Additionally you always get gold and card rewards for beaten battles.

A special card in your deck is your champion which is the closet thing to represent your character in this game. The champion is a super powerful unit that has better stats than most units and unique abilities. Champions can be upgraded at the start of the run and after the first two major bosses with one of three different upgrade paths. These all fit into different strategies and can synergize greatly with your deck.

Monster Train features 5 different clans which determine what cards you can find during the run. You can select two different clans for your run, the first clan you take also decides what Champion you get. If you start the game, you will have to unlock three of the five clans. The other two, Hellhorned and Awoken, are beginner friendly and help  new players to get a good understanding of the game. They are also less specific in their type of strategies and gimmicks.
Hellhorned are generally strong units with high attack or high armor for protection. They are the most straightforward clan, having both attackers and tanks and even some damage spells. They can summon imps, small and weak units, that provide different summon effects.
Awoken are mainly tanks and healers. They have super toughj tanks with a lot of HP and these tanks activate abilities if they are healed.
Stygian, for most the first unlocked clan, are spellcasters. Hhey have the most damaging spells in the game and have both high instant damage and damage over time. Their units also get buffs when you activate spells.
Umbra summon small units, that are eaten by other units to give them better stats and buffs. They also come with damage shields and lifesteal and are overall good in protecting your units.
Melting remnant on the other hand does not care for death in your ranks. Their units are disposable and meant to die. They can revive and improve your units but in return those units have a short lifespan. Some of their units activate effects only when they die.

Experimenting with the clans and finding out how they play together is part of the charme of the game. For players who like many different combinations that you can try out this is a very welcome sight. Each clan also has its own set of artifacts which will also improveyour playstyle and makes up for crazy strategies. Melting Remnant has an artifact that gives +10 damage to units when they die, Awoken has a unit with 3 attacks. Let this unit die over and over and revive it again and again and suddenly you have a unit with 90 attack damage and 3 attacks. You can be even crazier and use another units who auto-revives cards for you when it dies and give them 40 extra attack. That way you can create a loop of dying and buffing.

This is just the tip of the iceberg and I could go on how great the synergies in this game are. Best way to find this out is play for yourself which is why you shoudl get this game.
You will get a lot of hours into the game, just winning with every clan bombination can take you a long time. Not to mention that the game features 25 difficulty ranks. These ranks are designed that they increase the difficulty over time so you get better and understand better what combinations work well tgether.
I also think this is one of the best balanced games. Every card has its own value even if it does not look like it at first. Of course there are always cards that have more value than others but I actually think there is no useless card in the game that I would never pick.

Also, I love the soundtrack of this game. It fits the game perfectly. When I played Slay the Spire, I found myself to deactivate the soundtrack because I foudn it distracting. In this game I always play with the music enabled.",1617824563,1617824563,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nice concept, nice arts, nice mechanics - the only thing I was missing compared to STS was a true final boss, since I was able to beat the game after only a few runs (but I kept playing since there is a mode where each run it gets harder triggering some extra challanges and to unlock all factions/heroes) - now the DLC delivered what I was missing, and added even more interesting mechanics.

Definitely one of my fav single player CGC!

The pacing is on point. Sessions last exactly as long as they're welcome. It rains upgrades, delicious little decisions, and then you're back in the battle machine. Content unlocks at the right pace, and there's a huge amount of it. The five clans (six with DLC) are similar to the elemental colors of MTG and each have their own well-realized tricks.

The balance is in a great place. As the difficulty gets higher, the game intentionally, deliberately becomes more and more about finding something to exploit, and doing so scratches that itch every lover of this kind of strategy chases across genres. The disgusting combos are real and they are glorious.

Try Hadean Tactics or Vault of the Void instead. Unless you haven't played StS yet, of course ;)",1617671726,1617671726,False,1,2,0.341634601354598999,0,True,False,False

I usually play MMOs but sometimes, i try something new and i am happy i did. I have not much experience in neither Roguelikes nor Card games. I played some Darkest Dungeon before, but thats about. Oh well i finished For the King once. 

However, this game really got me. I love it and i hope that there will be more DLCs coming. I have yet to buy the DLC and i will, but i am still trying to complete every possible combination at rank 25 etc etc and i have a lot of fun. Every run feels different, every ""Class"" feels different. The devs really put in so many different mechanics and those mechanics mix up pretty darn good with others.

I also love that it just takes about an hour to finish one round so it is nice to just hop in and play 1 round or 2... or maybe 10 lol. I cant stop it and this happens rarely to me. I have spent 60 hrs by now which at least for me, is pretty solid for 1 week. As i said, every run feels different, lots of things you can try and work towards, long time motivation and it is not too punishing. I mean not punishing at all cause you just lose maybe 1 hr of a run and than you start over again. 

So yeah, i didnt enjoy a game like this since ehm, i played Mutant Year Zero, which ofc you cant compare because it is a different genre but i am having a blast. So please Devs, i read the DLC is awesome as well and i am excited, hopefully you continue on this game with more good content.

The DLC feels light on content but it adds a much better difficulty scaling feature. The covenant system is kinda lame with how it just keeps adding useless cards or adding health/damage to enemies but it's inclusion is necessary as the game's difficulty at lower levels becomes trivial once you know what the cards are. These are minor gripes though, overall the game is a blast and purchasing the DLC was an easy decision considering how much mileage I had already gotten out of the game.

So, there's not a lot of deckbuilding Roguelike games out there but with this latest update this is basically the best one. Also, if you are a fan of more turn based games where you can mull over your decisions, this is the best one of those with a roguelike bent (not even sure if that's a thing). The amount of new decisions added in this latest expansion increase what was already a deep game to upper tiers of deep thought you don't always see in solo card games.

With 6 factions and now a second final (optional) boss and new ways to upgrade your run, even the same starting point will be drastically different from the last end point you reached last time with that same configuration.

Tried to verify integrity of files, reinstalled the game entirlely and scoured fourms for how to fix it. In case you don't allready know this game is known to have the black screen on launch issue. It has always been a problem and affects some users more aggresivly than others. I was preaty lucky to not have any techniqual issues until now where it flat out refuses to run anymore no matter what i do.

So take it from me. Don't purchase this game if you value your money not being taken from you for shoddy products that don't actually do the bare minimum of whats expected and you know actually work.

Edit: this review will stay up unless this company's lackluster customer service finally decides to listen and fix the issue.

Edit 2.0: game works now. If you have any issues with black screen of death unsubscribe from all your mods. They are causing the game to be unstable and a lot of others have had similer issues.

There are so many ways to mix and match the different factions, and even within a single faction there are different viable builds, so much that pretty much any run can be winnable as long as you make the right decisions along the way and manage your risks vs. rewards.

There are some things that I absolutely love about this game compared to others of similar genre that might get overlooked by some reviewers.  One is the logbook and the sheer amount of collectibles.  Once you get the gist of the game, it shouldn't take you that long to eventually beat your first run, but the game doesn't really end there as you are unlocking new difficulty levels (called covenants) and leveling up your factions to unlock more cards. And the cards you win a run with now get a Mastered card backing, and there are other achievements that unlock additional card backings.  The logbook is beautiful and is loaded with your stats and everything you've seen and mastered, and for game completionists it's a dream come true, and there is a LOT to unlock.

Next is the multiplayer aspects, which really doesn't need to exist at all but I'm glad it does.  Hell rush is fun speedrun mode where you compete with other players to see who can get the highest score, or just survive, though recently it's been difficult to get games populated to enjoy it sometimes.  But the daily runs are also done with the same multiplayer aspect where you can see everyone else who is playing at the same time as you.  It's honestly pointless but I just think it's cool and makes it feel less lonely I guess.

The game's a blast and I think I'll be playing this a little bit every day trying to fill out my logbook.",1608519118,1616950289,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

While you can certainly influence the game by placing your units in different ways on the levels decks and the decisions you make about which cards to keep and play in your run are very important, if you don't get the right drops of items, units or special effects throughout the run, it will be very difficult for you. I know this feature is present in many other games, but in this game it feels heavily present and effectual. Each run just feels like a lottery, hoping for the right items or drops. If you don't get them, it will very hard for you and  perhaps no fun for you (or less). If you do get them, you will steam roll to victory and the margin for error will be so high. It can be a bit boring that way. You know if you get the right items, it will be easy. Or that if you don't it will be hard and a grind. There is no mystery to the run. I don't feel like I can pull myself up by my bootstraps and make a bad run good. I just feel like if it is bad, it is bad, if it is good, it is good. There isn't a lot of complexity there to the game

While I get that that art of this game is good and they have put effort into the class system, ultimately it feels a bit 2 dimensional, especially compared to some in the genre. Once you understand how each champion works, whether you will win the run just depends on what items you get in the run. You can't turn a good run bad, or a bad run good. Or at least, it is very difficult to do so. You will either be having a party on round 2 cause you are steamrolling your enemies without any effort on your behalf, or you will be sweating away round by round, hoping not too much damage gets done to your pyre in that one..",1616659567,1616659803,False,4,2,0.411030352115631104,0,True,False,False

But there is one tragic flaw with this game, and the reason for my negative review: the randomness of the cards being dealt will be the reason you lose a run nine times out of ten. You won't lose because you did something wrong that you can learn from, you will lose because the game isn't giving you the cards you need. For instance, with the first hand of the battle, you should be given mostly units, but most of the time you'll be dealt your champion and maybe one other unit, along with some other cards you don't yet need. Well, if in the first round of battle the enemies outnumber the two units you were dealt, you can most likely say goodbye to your champion right off the bat, greatly reducing your chances of winning that battle -- or at least, your pyre keeping much of its health before winning that battle. Also, I can't count how many times I needed a card to replenish a unit's health to only be dealt a health card after the unit dies. 

As I said before, it's addictive and fun and I do appreciate the art style. The game does have its redeeming qualities, and I think anyone who plays it will enjoy it, but I can't give it a positive review as anyone who plays it will also find a lot of frustration.",1616621280,1616621280,False,5,0,0.295663058757781982,0,True,False,False

Where to start, where to start:
I was one of the  people that played Slay the Spire and thought ""Man i love the game, and i would love it even more if it was not as dense as it is"" , if you are in a very similar situation, congratulations, you may enjoy this game, i'm not 100% sure, but you know, at least i think that way, the game still gives a couple of kick square in the Nuts, so you better prepare some extra ice.
Lets start complaining:

-Seraph the patient: almost all my problems begin and end with this absolute unit of RNG curses, it will come a time when you are used to go full ""RNGesus is my lord and savior."" and you will only ask to not have your run halted by it's presence, he is just so much more tedious to figth compared to any other enemy in the game, he is the only seraph that attacks your units when you are building you ""army"", he is the only one wich true penalty is still in effect when you start the final wave, he is the only one that complatly changes the way you buld you deck, so yeah he is not fun, you could say that i writed this entire review just to say f*ck him, anyways.

-The cards as a whole feel over-balanced; that can be either a positive or a negative depending in what kind of person you are, to me there is nothing really explosive about the way combos work in this game, combos in on themseselves are non-existent, instead we have synergies, and you know, in a mostly sigle player game that is kinda boring in my humble opinion.

-The game as a whole feels completely explored, each clan highligths a system of the game and thus you find your favorite synergy rather quick, i personally dont feel like is anything else to explore and as any modern deck building game it feels like there is no point in keep playing it; there is not a lot WOW moments after the 20 hour mark it's all primitive pattern finding satisfaction and that may get old fast if you are the kind of person that hates busy work.

As always this is my personal opinnion and you may not see these points as a negative, feel free curse me all you want, nothing new there.",1611225536,1613947104,True,0,0,0.458579868078231812,0,True,False,False

The runs turn around much faster, averaging around 45 minutes depending on how you play. Because of this, you are less ""locked-in"" each run and there is less emphasis on building an enormous deck. You also have much more control over what you pick, so you have a lot more flexibility and seemingly mediocre run can turn around rather quickly.

The card types are split into Minions and Spells, and you can choose to emphasize either one or both; the minions offer a huge variety is probably my favorite difference from Slay the Spire. The minions vary widely in terms of their stats and many of them have some unique mechanics that can really change a run.

You have the progression and the deck types, which is probably my favorite part of the game. Each run, you'll choose a Primary faction that gives you one of two heroes to start with as well as the deck you'll draw from. You'll also pick a  Secondary faction from which you will also draw cards. Each faction has two heroes, and each hero has three specializations that will get upgraded along the run. If you've done the math, that's a lot of widely varied playstyles. The faction are also widely different to play at a fundamental level. I won't spoil the fun, but the three unlocked factions are super interesting from a design perspective and dramatically change the way you approach each run.

Overall, this game is a fantastic rogue-lite that is most easily compared to Slay the Spire, but manages to improve on that game and also carve out a niche for itself.

At first I was afraid it was too easy because I would frequently get far into the game with little effort and I won my first game after only five runs. Like other Rogue-lites, there's several hurdles of grind you have to jump over to progress because of the difficulty ramping up with every win. Once I unlocked everything for most clans, I blew through difficulty levels with no issue until about Covenant 10, with Covenant 12 filtering me for a few days. 

Unfortunately this game turns from playing a FNM draft to a top tier tournament where you have to run abusive strategies of playing your whole deck in one turn. When you use a non-creature card, it will go into your ""discard"" pile which gets shuffled into your draw pile if your draw pile is emptied, similar to a non-CCG tabletop card game. This results in easy loops on top of some clans getting access to playing cards removed from the game (the actual discard piles). Tryharding can still be difficult because of the randomized starting cards you are assigned; some bosses are just broken garbage that require very specific strategies to beat which might not be available to you depending on your clan picks. Overall the clans are decently balanced but I feel Hellhorned & Stygian primaries require *very* specific strategies to win with (Stygian especially likes to screw my runs with bad RNG).

Outside of the card game elements, this game is pretty average except for the good soundtrack. Animations are barebones, sound effects sound like library edits, and the graphics (from technical and art style standpoints) look like something from a mobile game. There is technically multiplayer (but I don't think anyone ever cared for it judging by the Steam forum) and you have your typical daily challenges and custom community challenges, but the meat of the game is still climbing difficulties in Standard Runs.

It might sound like I'm really bashing Monster Train but I actually I really enjoyed this game until I got filtered by higher difficulties. I'm looking forward to future patches and DLC bring balancing improvements to certain bosses and the narrower clans with any new content. This is an easy recommend to CCG fans but Rogue-lite fans need to realize this is more of a CCG with harder RNG than a Rogue-lite with cards.",1613325505,1613325505,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

What really sells it for me though is how much it differs from Slay the Spire, an extremely popular deck builder that I don't quite like that much. For example, in Spire you pick a character and the deck you get almost solely relies on their card drops to be built. Monster Train instead lets you pick a faction with it's hero, card etc. BUT THEN, they let you draft another faction to help add more variety to the deck, and even than through random events you can get cards related to other factions you didn't pick for true variety. You can even see the bosses that you will face in the run, to properly be able to build your deck around it, instead of being blindsided by a boss that counters your deck after 40 minutes of playing. *cough* Time Eater *cough*

With 20 hours, I have most of the major unlocks but plenty of minor ones are still out there, and I'm still encountering new events, artifacts, and cards.

I bought it because I really like slay the spire and it is indeed similar however significantly different to make it not more of the same.  One of the best things about Monster train compared to slay the spire is that it shows the amount of damage an enemie will take which avoids a lot of calculations to be done.
The classes are very different and having a main and subclass in every run gives a lot of options. The 2 champions for each class are also hugely different and after 16 hours I didn't try them all yet(or even unlocked all) so if you are buying this you can easily spend 40+hours on this game which is considering the price already a good thing.
Also after each succesful run the diffeculty increases(you can turn it off) which I think keeps the game challenging at all moments.
However it is not all good, some cards seem much stronger than others and some championns and cards have very litttle synergy.  Overall I think there can be more balance applied. Some quick improvements would be an instant resolve battle and 4th option for general improvement which is more risky because it doesn't buff the pyre.

Having played this game after Slay the Spire, I can say that this game triumphs in many aspects. The soundtrack is beautiful, the strategy element is more complex but not too confusing to comprehend, luck plays less of a factor here, there are just so many categories that this game tops StS.

Starting with combat, each game, you have a train with 4 floors- Three base floors, followed by your Pyre Room (acting as the heart of your run- It's health is your health). The base floors can have units placed on them to defend your Pyre room, and enemy units flood into your train starting with the bottom floor. If they aren't defeated when comparing health and power, they will move up a floor the following turn. Some enemies have abilities like Thorns (deals damage when hurt) and Haste (Skips the second base room when ascending a floor after combat) making strategies require more thinking than just blindly playing cards. On top of these units, each run gives you a set of spell cards that allows you to hurt the enemies, augment your own creatures, draw cards, and heal your allies among many other effects.

Units and spells can be upgraded at the expense of some money you pick up along the way, either boosting their overall power, or giving them a new ability. However, this money can instead be saved in the event that a shop in the future of your current run possesses better items to buy.

Bosses all have random abilities per run, making each playthrough unique. Sometimes you get an enemy that strongly opposes your current strategy, like one of the bosses negating the buffs of your allies. If you played a run that supports buffs, it becomes more difficult, but still doable. 

When playing, you have the choice of five (and counting!) different clans, all with different playstyles and cards that come with them. Each clan has one extra strong unit called a champion, that you upgrade as the run progresses for free. This champion always starts in your opening hand, and provides some more unique elements to deckbuilding. As you play, each clan unlocks an additional champion, which allows you to tap into the different playstyles of each clan. After choosing your main clan, you can select a supporting clan, which you won't get a champion from, but supporting cards in your deck and as the run progresses. Try out unique combinations like Hellhorned and Awakened, to heal your tanky creatures, or Umbra and Awakened to buff your multistrike and quick units, so on and so forth. 

The game provides Artifacts, which are passive buffs that help you in battle, whether they increase your unit capacity per floor or how many cards you can use in a turn. Some encourage unique strategies like playing a bunch of units at once, or playing with higher cost spells at the expense that they have random casting costs.

By far, this game is one of the better deckbuilding roguelikes I have played in a while, the art and music are stunning, and variations per run are very high. There is so much more to this game that I didn't even get to mention, too, so I recommend you give the game a shot and see it for yourself.

I love Slay the Spire, but Monster Train somehow lacks that game's fluidity: perhaps it's the way the battles and the upgrade stages of the game feel like they're separate from one another, so you lose your angel-killin' rhythm; perhaps it's that there are only eight battles per run, so you rarely get the same feeling that you're on a roll.

The variety of the different decks is great, make no mistake: I love the way that they encourage different strategies, and mixing and matching your allies is a brilliant idea. At the same time the baddies can't match this variety: the mooks feel like much of a muchness, while the way the bosses' qualities change from run to run (on some runs reacting to spellcasting, on others reacting to summoning creatures, etc) mean that no single boss has that strong an identity, either visually or in terms of their behaviour.

A lot of people love this game, and there's a lot of work and heart which has gone into (and is still going into) it.

EDIT: this was normaly a negative review, but i didn't got the errors anymore and i wouldn't want to bash on a game that is honestly very well made with seemingly caring developers.

BUT everytime a room loads, if you tab out of the game or sometimes (although this is a very slim chance) on its own the game crashes, but not just crashes, it can fuck up things running on your pc. Youtube only showing the video and everything else being blacked out, other apps having the same issue of being blacked out partialy or entirely making it a drag to navigate through your pc but the worst was one time where my entire screen blacked out and i had to forcefully quit my pc (alt tabbing, opening task manager, escaping, going into sleep mode, all those options failed then).

Never have i experience crashes like this with games so far and i would've given it a positive review if it crashed from time to time but just instantly closes the game in response, but this and the toll it can demand on my pc is too much. I'd like better crash support from the game and a better response to getting stuck, starting with the game terminating itself easier in such occassions instead of straining my other applications.

I just finished the last main big difficulty spike, Covenant Level 25/25 and have been the game with every class and ally combination - it was a pretty big puzzle! The game coaxes you into it with upgrades that DRASTICALLY change how good your monsters and spells are. Something that is garbage when you pick it up because an unstoppable killing machine after a few well placed upgrades from the shop and before you know it, you start steamrolling over everything in sight because you found the god combo!

That's the thing... the game is DESIGNED around you finding the god combo and that's what makes it great! If you don't find it or the enemies trip you up in a way you don't expect, your perfect set up falls apart and the run is just... over. Pfffft, just like that. Into the later stages of the game, it really starts to feel like a puzzle... every level between bosses has a more difficult mode with better rewards and going from good to great is gauging how much you think you can handle (or sacrifice) to get those extra goodies - I love that. Not to mention there's easy to read branching paths between levels that let you pick how you want to adjust your deck and spend your gold; there's a lot of customization! Is it as break crunching as Slay the Spire? No! I'm glad it's not actually, it makes it a refreshing game to sit down and keep going back to and that's why it's so much fun.

Not to mention, the music for this game? It's actually pretty frickin' good. The art seems a little all over the place, but after seeing the final credits roll and all the people that put in their ideas for neat and interesting monsters... you come to appreciate the love they put into it.

At the very minimum I'd say I play three times a week.  The graphics quickly grew on me.  At first sight I wasn't crazy about them but now they look great and fit nicely.

I don't know know if there will be a card game quite this good for a very long time.    This game is beautiful and I think it will be looked back on as a staple in the genre.

I'd almost say it does for card games what Divinity Original Sin did for CRPG's...and that's a huge compliment.  If for some reason you're reading this and haven't bought / tried this game you owe it to yourself.  Just buy it and play less than two hours.  If for some reason you don't like it then you can get a refund.  

It is seriously a masterpiece .  I'll buy any and all DLC as well as follow the developer for any future games.


__OLD REVIEW BELOW__

I've only played this six hours and I can say it is amazing.  I enjoyed Slay The Spire but this feels way more streamlined.  I felt like in StS there were just some garbage battles I didn't care for.  This game feels like fewer more ...""epic"" battles.  

I don't know if i'll ever be ""done"" w/this game but I assume it'll get me well over 40 hours if not over 80.  I had 88 hours in StS and I didn't even beat the real last boss.  

I will say the graphics initially made me hesitant to buy this game...just wasn't for me.  That being said no review on youtube really captured what this game was for me.  You can always return it if you don't like it within two hours......but I don't see many people not liking it.

Who placed the cold side (where the angels are) up front and the hot side (where your troops are) at the back?

I mean in an old steamtrain you woud shovel the coal from the tender into the engine.
Why do the winged / wingless ... the stupid angel troops not attack through flying from above landing on the roof of the train and work down to the enginge/ ember shard to destroy / stop the train ?

It's so cool that they're still adding new (endgame) content. I have to say, after unlocking everything and getting all achievements I do not play the game a ton anymore, but it still took me almost 140h to do so, so that's absolutely fine for me and in any case absolutely worth the money. I do still watch videos on the daily challenges because I love the crazy combos used there (costumization to more directly try some of that would be a cool addition I think - maybe like a ""training room"" where you can freely set up enemies and define your deck). Also, I will definitely come back to it once the new content is available (wouldn't even mind paying for it to support the game) and again, better add some solid endgame content later than just anything boring.

At the core of the game it is very easy to get into and when going deeper into the meta and schematics of each clan card building it becomes more and more of a chemistry vibe, where each card can work greater with another.
The whole deck building of each run of how you would like your run to go is heavy RNG based and each run is almost certainly different than the other, once you get familiar with each card of each clan, the outcome of how the end deck looks is very enjoyable and the difficulty always stays the same, unless you wish for a challenge. The game can certainly give you many options if you wish for greater difficulty.

[b] Monster Train, Is a fantastic experience and deserves love. [/b]

A lot of people compare this to Slay the Spire or Hearthstone and say it is lacking, well these are obviously fan boys or girls of those games that dislike believing that another game can take the stage, Monster Train is well worth the gamble and if you were a fan of those I know you will fall in love with it.

When we talk about Monster Train it is inevitable to draw comparisons to Slay the Spire, so first and foremost, we can draw a few differences between them.

-StP is based around a single character with different moves and artefacts, meanwhile MT works around units and positions.
-StP can sometimes be unforgiving, a mistake can just ruin a run without any way for the player to avoid getting killed in the next combat, on that regard, any combat in MT can be won, even with one hit point left.
-StP has four main characters with a set of builds and possibilities, MT has six clans that always start the run with an allied clan that offers less depth, but more variability.
-StP can have long runs, averageing one hour per run, MT tend to be much shorter, many successful runs can end in 30 minutes with no issue.

Monster train is a game that may look shorter and more shallow, but in return offers much more freedom for the player to experiment, there is rarely a wrong move, even the starting stewards can become very powerful if they're buffed and supported correctly. Especially now, with the option to fuse units, it's extremely hard to get the same run or to get the same gimmick twice, even if you try to imitate a successful strategy, you will only get something similar, and it may not work again.

Music, art and sound effects are charming, all units can be told apart from others.

It has a multiplayer mode, it works like single player, but with a timer, to punish those who take too long, and a score system, to pick a winner.
It also has a challenge mode, that allows players to make runs with conditions, both advantageous and otherwise, once again competing for high scores. Both modes are a nice addition that keeps the game fresh and allows the player to try something different if they got stuck with the main mode.

One of my few complaints is about Seraph, the final boss, and the fact that while there are many versions of it, there is only one design, with a palette swap per version.

In the end this is the kind of game that you start thinking that after 10 hours you will be done with it, only to check the clock and see that you have already spent 30 and you're not even near covenant 25, where the game truly shows its teeth.

Give it a shot, it's worth whatever it costs right now, you will get your money's worth and then some.",1610228830,1610228830,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have only put 22 hours into this game but its addictive and it can be brutal at times. I like the deck building but sometimes you can just start a run with a losing combination of random cards which sometimes is a bummer. Sometimes you just get random cards that you know will carry you far. I wish there was a bit more animation to the characters and enemies but that is fine the art style works.

It is not overly ""expensive"" for the game to potentially keep a good pace of publishing DLCs or any other content which will stress gameplay, not the art part. This game is about good gameplay. 

The difficulty curve is very good in my opinion. The covenant rank difficulty approach is at point. Every clan mechanics has a unique part in it. Mastering a clan takes time. Understanding and mastering each card is a fascinating and interesting process. And this process has different layers of depth. 

About the upgrades when progressing through the rings of hell... At first I thought capacity upgrade is always the way to go. But later I understood the value of other upgrades for different clans and different circumstances. Relics are very meaningful and add a direction to your play or give great support for you.

Balance is striking. This game has little useless cards, relics, units.

What would be great is more enemies. The variety is quite poor. But the difficulty change overrides the lack of new enemy mechanics/combinations. 

It would be great to add a player vs player runs. You build your deck against other player's decks. And race to bring the pyre to ignite hell. I think this is what this game needs in future versions. 

The mods support out of the box and the ability to design new cards and new clans and publish it for the players is amazing! Fascinating opportunity to bring so much gameplay and different mechanics to the world. This game is at the top. Very good game and IMO can cost even more.

This game is a fantastic deckbuilder - very similar at first glance to critically acclaimed Slay the Spire. Would absolutely 100% recommend for fans of the genre - don't wait for sale its too good. Having combat over 3+1 floors and having to pick between 2 of 5 decks (major and supporting) allows for a ton of customisation - really fun runs.

The only criticism I have is that with StS the elites and final bosses all had unique abilities and artwork. 
With Monster Train the mini bosses and final bosses DO come in 3 different variants but the artwork is almost identical so it feels like you are just fighting the same 3 guys every run. Would be nice to see different artworks even if the 3 current variants were the same

The challenge is figuring out what strengths or weaknesses your deck has, and if any new cards offered to you will make your deck better or worse.

Monster train is a cardgame/tower defense roguelike that has you defending a pyre atop 3 levels of a moving hellbound locomotive trying to re-ignite a literal frozen-over Hell. You play monsters and spells in synergistic ways do defeat waves of enemies, with the ability to upgrade you spells and units as the run progresses, picking up relics which give various unique effects.

The closest similarity is Slay the Spire, but the game has various differences that make it stand out, I won't go into details about specifics as that requires familiarity with the game but just broad strokes:

[b] Shorter, intense runs:[/b] The runs in this game are quite short compared to most others in the genre, averaging between 20-45 mins, what this means is your deck and options scale fast, meaningful decisions happen early and often.

This encourages multiple playthroughs and definitely has that ""just one more"" quality. In addition the game informs you of all the main bosses, the end boss and gives a complete map ahead of time, so pausing runs for later is never a problem, just take a look at the map and you can easily figure out what you were building towards

[b] Far less RNG:[/b] The game uses various levels on the train, with enemies starting at the bottom, in addition you always draw your champion who is powerful and consistent at the start of each battle along with any banner(class) units every turn, this leads to runs where variance occurs but you never feel outright screwed because you didn't draw your block in time.

[b] A much better difficulty curve:[/b] The game actually starts out pretty easy, the card variety is far more limited, you can't play the hard factions before unlocking them and there is a lot of discovery and experimentation, which is really fun! It's so easy in the beginning you get to check out the cool bosses and experience a lot with little pressure and it makes unlocking and beating the harder difficulties more rewarding in comparison.

[b] Presentation and flair:[/b] The game has an amazing soundtrack, interesting lore and an abundance of easter eggs and little quirks like any good roguelike, it also has a speed up option and various set speeds, with a logbook that shows your progress in terms of unlocks, wins, cards etc, which is really handy and motivates you to play more. The presentation is excellent which is a welcome surprise because a lot of these mechanics first games have pretty meh aesthetics. 

[b] The faction diversity:[/b] The game has 5 different factions to mix and match with two champions each, when playing you chose a main faction which supplies your champion and a supporting one. This leads to a ton of variety thematically and gameplay wise, covering all the archetypes you would expect such as graveyard synergy, big bois, spellslinger, consuming to grow etc. It also draws out many players to various favorites, which is always a good sign. Playing demons, hellspawn, imps and eldritch horrors is just more fun and interesting than being the good guy like in the majority of games.

At the current price its a steal, tonnes of content, great music, replayability, challenge and with it's excellently paced difficulty curve you can be a complete newbie to this genre or hardened min/maxing theorycrafting veteran and have just as much fun. [spoiler] It also has a skeleton doggo that heals your pyre every turn. [/spoiler]

Edit: So I've put more time into the game, and after reaching Cov25 the game just doesn't really feel balanced at all, doing a random-random run feels like banging your head into a brick wall, there are so many synergies that flat out don't work and the path to victory often involves ignoring half your deck and just focusing on what synergies jump out while removing as many cards as possible. 

I feel like if it wasn't for the upcoming DLC I would honestly give up on the game at this point, although it did give me a good amount of hours it doesn't really live up to games like Slay the Spire etc, the attention to detail regarding balance just isn't there, some classes struggle too much to clear backline and the vast difficulty jump between most Seraphs and The Patient is sort of glaring when you look at it, you can have a perfectly valid strategy but the Patient can kinda just shut it down.",1606935732,1609754700,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's loud and flashy, but the game is mostly won at the strategy layer, where it's a game of matching units and spells to the upgrades they need to be effective. Individual battles generally don't involve a lot of skill. The switch from drawing being abundant and energy being very rare to drawing being very rare and energy being abundant means it's common for the player to dump their entire hand every turn.

But despite both being deckbuilders with clear, focused, well-communicated design, Monster Train is aiming for a different experience. Slay the Spire is about assembling a toolbox, where you will never be more than a few suboptimal choices away from defeat. That's incredible game design, but it can also be stressful. Monster Train is a game about figuring out how to make yourself invincible using the components the game has given you.

I hate to knock Slay the Spire as it was the first card based game I really enjoyed but this just takes everything STS does and cranks it up to 11.

If you are a fan of Slay the Spire or similar games you owe it to yourself to try this one.

1. There is stupid amount of replay ability and variety: 10 ""champion"" cards to pick from after you unlock them all (which if you love games like this will take you a few evenings of addictive fun), picking allied clan/champion means that you have 40 possible starting decks to choose from, which then get further customized at the start by addition of 5 random cards from your covenant lvl. This means that each run starts very uniquely. 
Add to this the fact that you get randomized bosses, and even if you get exact same set-up at the start, you need to change your strategy to fit the final encounter. 

2. From the moment your run start the game tells you what main 3 enemies you will face. No surprises here, instead you get to start preparing a unique strategy for how your deck should evolve from round one. This means that, while there is still a fair amount of randomness in the game, it's just the right amount to give you options, but you will never be surprised by and end boss that just so happens to counter your build. Instead, you get to make sure you counter his.

3.The lore/ art direction is interesting. At first this put me off from buying the game but it's actually quite refreshing. You have a 4-story tall train that you need to defend against an army of angels (who honestly seem to be the bad guys here) as it makes its way towards the frozen heart of hell itself. Pretty weird and quirky.

First, runs start off way more interesting. There's only a handful of combats in this game, so you get RIGHT to the interesting decisions. Decks are smaller. There's way less relic-hunting. Upgrades are fat and sweet.

Secondly, the combat itself is so much more satisfying. You are actually playing out units a bit like a simplified tower defense game, and placement matters. You're never just playing out your hand on auto-pilot like StS feels sometimes. 

At first I thought the theme was goofy and made no sense (It's a train! But only one tall and skinny car? And it's all along one path? And you are going through various circles of hell to fight.. angels? And it's kind of steampunky?)  I'll admit I'm still not a huge fan of the art style, but the gameplay brings childlike glee when you smash your big monsters against each other and the childlike theming has warmed on me. 

And for what it's worth, the classes are pretty cool and have been very well thought out. You pick two for each run. There's a lot of crazy mechanisms, and sometimes mixing them doesn't work the way you think, or you get burned by not understanding what's going on, but overall I am pretty satisfied with easy mechanics are to pick up. I am comparing this to Griftlands, which made my head hurt to learn all the different mechanics, often confusingly named. And mechanics are very siloed in general, so it makes it that much less fun to learn.

As a criticism, some of the numbers involved get stupid big. Thank goodness the game does calculations for you and has a fast forward button.

Also, the game is not nearly as forgiving on hardware as Slay the Spire. For a game that's not any prettier, it will chug on my laptop and consume battery 3x as quickly.

A lot of people are comparing this to Slay the Spire, so let's compare it to Slay the Spire as someone with shy of 400 hours on StS and 50 hours in MT. Both games follow the same format as a roguelite deckbuilder. You have a series of maps with some altering paths along the way, adding cards to your deck as you progress, and every turn in combat you have a limited amount of energy to play your cards. Sometimes, you pick up relics that modify how the game plays.

In my eyes, that's where the similarities end. Monster Train has several ""layers"" to it that the enemies try to scale to reach the Pyre, which acts as your health pool. You summon creatures to impede the enemies path, and combat takes place on each individual layer independently. If enemies are not defeated, they advance. Boss units at the end of each fight battle until they lose, or your monsters lose, instead of just one round.

The clans add a lot of fun variety, and being able to pick a secondary clan to diversify the card pool is a lot of fun. The card pools per clan are much smaller than card pools per character in StS, but mixing and matching clans gets you far more variety. There are two major bosses per major boss stage until you get the the end, and each major boss has small variations in their play style (such as attacking immediately or granting buffs to their allies), and the final boss has several styles of his own, which is more than StS has.

However, Monster Train is much, MUCH more forgiving, and in my eyes, far easier than StS. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing depends on the individual player; I personally find StS' challenge very satisfying, and while Monster Train is a fun little time killer, speeding through all the Champion/clan combinations and up to Covenant rank 11 with one or two losses lacks the same sense of accomplishment. However, StS can be rough, so if you're looking for an easier or more casual time, Monster Train may be perfect for you.

I still recommend Monster Train, even as someone that prefers Slay The Spire. I love any card-based game that uses lanes (RIP SolForge) and I like that it tracks your friends' scores. Hell Train is fun (a strictly timed competition between five players for the best score). The lore for the clans are great. I look forward to what kind of content future updates will bring.

Rector Flicker/Awoken trivializes the game thus far.

There are 5 races to play with and 3 of them unlock over time.  I just unlocked the 5th.  The achievement states that 65.5% of players have it.  I am guessing it took 40-50 hours of play to get there.  People that like a roguelike card battler really do like this game.  The other things to know about the 5 races is that you pick 2 for each run.  One is your lead and determines your champion.  A zero cost unit that always starts in your hand.  I think this gives you 10 different combinations that you can run.

You fight 7 battles to complete a play through, unless you get killed early.  The later battles can take awhile to complete.  I haven't timed a run but it seems like it takes 90 minutes but is probably 2-3 hours.

After the first 6 battles you get to choose between two sets of upgrades.  Upgrading spells or creatures.  Card removal.  Artifacts.  Random encounter goodness.  Restore health to train so that you might survive the next bad fight.  Duplicate a card.  Get 75 coins.  Some of these will be in one group and some in the other.  You get to choose which set you explore.  Sometimes there will be selection that both choices access.  The upgrades for your cards are still random.  You get three random selections that you can buy individually.  You can pay 50 coins for a random restock.  If you have banked enough coins you can buy all 3, restock, buy the 3 replacements.  

There is a lot of ability to jack up the game difficulty.  At first the game seems way too easy.  I won my first 3 in a row without really trying.  Then I lost.  Each time I played I had jacked the game difficulty up by 1.  I won't play the easiest 2 settings, but after that it depends on how much I have unlocked for the races I am running.  There are 25 difficulty settings, if I remember correctly...  That is pretty awesome.  I will try to beat the game on Covenant level 5 today, and keep working my way up.

This game is hard. One misplayed card can ruin your run, and there is no undo button.
It also seems really buggy. I regularly get failed save errors, the pyre health meter in the top left is often inaccurate, I've had the game freeze many times after the final boss, win or lose. Get a failed to save run error all the time. Freezes when I try to load run history.
It's ok but it lacks polish.

Update
Haven't experienced lately any technical issues mentioned above, which is great.
The more I play though the more flaws I see in the game.
One of the games factions is way more powerful then the others.
So much of a successful run comes down to RNG right at the start of the run.
Your starting cards, choice of two starting artifacts and hero options are decided for you.

It's basically the best parts of Slay the Spire crossed with the best parts of a tower defense game. During each run, you draft a handful of monsters and spells (how many depends on your build and preference but 20-30 is likely) and customize them with a variety of mix-and-match upgrades to help them defeat waves of invaders followed by a boss. There's a wide variety of monsters with varying purposes, both as combatants and for utility, and an equal variety of spells.

There are 5 monster clans to play as, each of whom have a couple specific focuses and very different gameplay. But in each run you play as an alliance of two clans, with a powerful ""champion"" from one of them who you can upgrade down three paths. And each faction has two champions (and two sets of starter spells). Taken together, there's a ton of different teamups you can apply even before you draft your first card, and one of the early difficulty modifiers adds a few random cards to your starting deck each run for more variety.

Speaking of, it has a difficulty scaling system similar to Slay the Spire. Each time you win on your highest Covenant level you unlock another level with a tweak to make it slightly harder (the new challenges being cumulative). Unlike STS, you advance on this scale for all factions at the same time, which is for the best since there's more of them. In a nice touch, as long as you're playing at least Covenant level 1 you unlock an alternate card border for any card you beat the game with, encouraging you to try out new cards and new builds. Within a run, each level except the three major bosses also has an optional challenge you can activate for an extra reward (such as extra gold if you give all the enemies a buff).

Enemies have a variety of unique abilities designed to punish over reliance on a certain strategy and force you to be flexible. There's also several variations of each major boss with similarly varied abilities. Another nice feature is that you get a preview of the major bosses (particularly the final boss) at the start of a run to help you plan your build, and before each level you get a preview of the level boss and of the enemy with the most notable special ability (with a description of said ability).

There's also daily challenges (with leaderboards) which apply a variety of modifiers to the game to make it easier or harder, and you can mix and match those modifiers yourself for a custom game. And heck, there's a few more extra modes I haven't even tried yet. This game has tons of replayability.

Production values are very high, with great visuals, music and sound design. The story premise is simple if you want to be but if you like lore there's in-character descriptions for every card and artifact in the between-runs logbook, along with in-battle dialog, which you can put together for a broader story.",1608614267,1608614267,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Simply wonderful. Easy to understand, very little hand-holding required. A superb example of how a roguelike should be done. Keeps you coming back for more. Comparisons to Slay the Spire and Hearthstone are where this game belongs and in my opinion, is a far more well rounded game than those.

Lets begin - graphically, it's what you'd expect. Some nice artwork, very nicely drawn. The sounds are brilliantly done and the soundtrack is phenomenal. But what will keep you clicking ""next run"" is that promise of the perfect deck. That one run where Seraph finally gets absolutely smashed by a team of demons you've assembled specifically to rip his annoying de-buffing face right off. 

There's so much to keep coming back for, catered to all play styles. You can be the simple physical smash deck with Hellbound or you can do something a little bit different by having weak starter cards and buff them gradually with something like Umbra. The champions are well balanced, although being honest - anything with multistrike absolutely destroys. Usually....

The developers need commending here. What a game. 10/10. Would lose hours of my life without realising again.

The gameplay TD-ish in the sense that you have three floors/lanes, enemies spawn from the bottom and advance up each turn. Combat happens automatically with Attack stats striking defense stats, and enemies attacking first unless you have abilities that do otherwise.

It borrows a bit from deck-builders like Smash Up! in the sense that there are many different factions with their own cardpools and champions. You select one faction to be your primary (and you get to use their Champion -- a creature that always starts in your hand that you often will build around), and another to be your secondary. These will be the two cardpools and artifact pools you work with and draft from thru the game.

Champions have upgrade paths and each faction has two champions. Between each floor are upgrade/shop floors to upgrade cards, get events, artifacts, and so on.

The main issue I personally have is the art style, it seems the artist cannot decide between full pre-mature ejaculation fan service, or covered head to toe in armour modest.

I've expected it to be more like roguelite deckbuilder game with a MtG/Hearthstone-style creature battle system. Instead it plays like a TD, a genre I am not a fan of. You basically set up a defence using limited space and then see how it fares against the boss. Rince and repeat. It's very puzzle-ish.

My main issue with the game is that it just feels so random, and that's coming from someone who enjoys roguelikes and card games. While in Slay the Spire you more or less understand why you've lost (aha, I should not have picked all those low impact powers in Act 3 against the Awakened One), in this game, you are left wondering what exactly went wrong. Some of the games you just stomp with absolutely no challenge, and some games feel hopeless. Overall balance just feels wild. In Slay the Spire, upgrading a card can make it 2 times better, in this game, it can make it... 10 times better?

While there are 5 factions you can combine (leading into total of 10/20 combinations depending on how you count), game does not appear to be that varied. Every faction has very few strategies. Green? Well, 90% of your synergies will be with heal and thorns. Blue? Well, you will have to go spell-heavy. Mixing them up does not change your gameplan, you have your main and supporting factions. No dual color cards.

Decks are built using monster and spell cards rather than attack and skill cards making deckbuilding more akin to traditional versus card games like Magic and Hearthstone. The combat itself happens over the course of 3 levels of your train + the top Pyre floor with surviving enemies going up a floor after each combat. The 5 factions all have unique gameplay elements and the champions gameplay varies even among the same champion as you can choose their upgrade path. 

There are several game modes, difficulties, and as mentioned above factions that you can play giving it a lot of replay value. The only downside I've found is that playing the same faction over and over can get stale since there are only so many cards and you tend to get forced into an archetype based on your champion's abilities.

[b]The game is fun and I enjoyed finishing all the classes.[/b] However, the Overwhelmingly Positive is not quite deserved, the game is overrated. At first, the game is way too easy (and that might not a bad thing for some casual players) but at the current price of 20‚Ç¨ I cannot recommend this game.

After finishing the game with a class, you can play on a new difficulty mode called ""Covenant Rank"" which goes from 1 to 25; so that you have an idea covenant 1 starts to be challenging (compared to the base difficulty which is non-existing) and RNG plays a big role. The more you play the more repetitive the run feels, the added difficulty is very artificial.

Monster Train is much easier than Slay The Spire generally speaking. Graphically, both have their charm. Both feel slick while playing. 

The core mechanics in both games vary just a bit and in my opinion Slay The Spire does a much better job overall, however, they share several things like the stops between fights, artifacts, etc. I would only recommend Monster Train if you own and finished Slay The Spire - at least with the basic characters - on the default difficulty.

[h1]Slay the Spire or Monster Train if I have none of them?[/h1]
Slay the Spire, without a doubt. Unless you are looking to play in ""zen"" mode, totally casual, in which case you might find Monster Train more appealing.

Ultimately, both Spire The Slay and Monster train can get a bit repetitive, is just that the mechanics of Monster Train makes it a bit more annoying.

[h1]How is the game, though?[/h1]
Graphics are good, music is decent, the game runs smooth. At first, the game is very interesting and definitively fun, but it gets repetitive very fast once you win with all the classes.

The ""covenant"" difficulty is not very well calibrated, covenant 1 is orders of magnitude more difficult than the default and you depend on the RNG a lot more.

In my case I already played Slay the Spire which I got from some bundle and I enjoyed Monster Train, which is essentially a copy of it. And so, I found Monster Train refreshing, but I cannot advise anyone to play this game first and then Slay The Spire to be honest.

You can beat the game with all classes in a few hours, your first run win can be in less than an hour, so it¬¥s that easy. IMHO, there should be more tracks per run, at least one more should be added.

The game at the full price is arguably expensive, I got it on 20% discount which is not that much after you see its content.

[b]What about replayability?[/b]
It has pvp, daily run and challenges. Since it has many classes and combinations together with covenant modes I can say there is a ton of replayability in Monster Train. Unfortunately, it gets boring rather fast and the difficulty added by the 25 Covenant Ranks is just tedious rather than fun.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
The game is fun (even if not for too long). You should play Slay the Spire first except if you want to play on ""easy mode"" only.

You can easily get up to ~30h of gameplay having fun before you enter Covenant Ranks, then it gets a bit tedious and more repetitive but if you are looking for a challenge you should play Slay the Spire.",1600615165,1607535586,False,2,0,0.463687151670455933,0,True,False,False

It is a sort of mixture of a card battler and a turn based tower defense where the towers are demons and minions you put down to fight against the hordes of angelic freaks out to destroy the life source of your train. It is pretty unique and great fun with various factions to choose from. Each play through you pick two factions and will only draw cards from those two factions and some neutral cards. You also get a much stronger and unique champion unit from your main faction. After enough play time you eventually unlock a second champion for each faction that can mix up the starting cards and playstyle quite a bit.

Each faction also plays quite differently from the rest. For example the starting faction has a lot of units and cards built around rage. Another faction is more plant based and seems built around tanks, spikes, and healing. It can be really interesting to mix and match the various factions to see how they complement each other. My favorite faction is really unique compared to the rest here and essentially involves making the front unit stronger through cannibalizing other units. 

Just like slay the spire, it is essential to find a way to scale, and there are various paths to do so. Just because a faction may be good at a particular strategy doesn't mean you will always roll that strategy and trying something new can surprise you. 

One thing I like is that after the initial run, each following run will display the three main bosses (like act bosses) at the beginning of the run. That way you can read ahead of time what each will do to be sure you don't build a deck that will be hard countered by them. It is important to read these, can be frustrating to scale via buffs then find out the final boss will just purge your buffs anyways making the DPS race much harder.

I do think Monster Train is one of the best card battlers out there and will be a mainstay along with Slay the Spire. My only real gripe with it is the same as other card battlers and that is they entice players to keep playing by challenging themselves on higher ascension difficulties. I had fun climbing them for a while but at some point some of the curses that come with the higher difficulty just got annoying -  such as stunning the top floor when you place a monster there. I understand the challenges are ways to force you to strategize more and vary your usual playstyles but at some point difficulty becomes less of a fun factor and more of a frustration. That is me though, there are certainly many out there that love the challenge.

Besides, nothing forces you to keep ascending. There are many records and a card compendium to fill out - can always just continue running normal playthroughs and attempt win streaks or just play for fun. It's a great game and can keep you going for a long while.",1607448798,1607448798,True,11,0,0.61015021800994873,1,True,False,False

If you came here for a change of pace from Slay the Spire or other deck builders, it is a little different but it is useful for comparisons. Overall I would say that a good run on monster train is way shorter than Slay the Spire, and that may be a positive for some as you get more runs, I dislike that fact, because it limits the amount of deck building choices you make. Each run in monster train feels like an act and a half in Slay the Spire, and this has consequences.

There is no early, medium, or late cards, its what cards fit into your already existing archetype--so when in Slay the Spire you may pick up a card to survive the early game or avoid a good card because its too late to be good, this game lacks those decisions, once you start a deck a card is either good in your deck or it wont ever be. The shorter game also limits the amount of satisfaction i feel from making a good deck, by the time its working its over.

Instead all the choices are based within the combat, where you set up your units and let them auto battle. On your turn you generally either buff your units, put more units into play, or attack or debuff the enemy. Since you can't easily rearrange your units, each battle seems more like a puzzle than combat. I love that, finding a balance between wiping mobs and making sure the resources are properly distributed to handle the boss.

The covenant system is supposed to be like Slay the Spires ascension, but I think it needs reworking. Some of them don't really impact the game all that much, and the ones that do are really boring effects, like a small buff to enemy damage. I still struggle to beat Slay the Spire's higher difficulties, but monster train, once I got a hang of it, I flew through the early covenants not sure if they were supposed to make the game harder or not.

Overall the game is good, I just wish there was at least an option to have longer runs with more deck building opportunities.

The gameplay involves you choosing an alliance between two factions and getting a hero unit in which you will use to defend the bases core in a 3 tier tower defense style play.

The fun comes from all the support units and spells you get that are represented as cards in a deck. You draft from a selection in the overworld and then play them out in turn based combat.

The challenge comes from punishing Rogue-like mechanics which reset you back to start should you lose.

The variety is that everytime you restart a new shuffled game awaits.

When you add on top of that a large number of clan cards and shops that can upgrade those cards along the way and artefacts that actually influence the run, you get huge replay value.

The game also has daily challenges and a ""multiplayer"" where multiple people start the same run and everyone has to play against the clock and the winner is the one with the most points. 

Also, the game is very polished and the UX is for the most part very good.

The game both plays and looks very similarly to Slay the Spire. It's a deck building rougelite with ""floors"".
As for the story, hell has frozen over and you, playing as factions from hell, try to reignite the fires. Heaven has sent beings to stop you.

I ""beat"" the game 2 hours in meaning I defeated the final boss for the first time but doing so I unlocked Covenant, effectively the same as Slay the Spire's Ascension.


- (Content) Because it is so similar to Slay the Spire, it also has its pitfalls: dead runs from the start and limited variation. However, there is slightly more variation due to having 5 clans and choosing a primary and ally clan each time means there's many unique ways to theme your deck.

~ (Story) There's a small story about the wars between Heaven and Hell.
~ It is VERY similar Slay the Spire. It has copied: artefacts, upgrades, Ascension and risk vs. reward fights just to name a few. Perhaps they are a staple to this relatively new genre? There are a few unique mechanics though: the levels on the train and the 2-class system. 

+ (Audio) Music sounds like a battle between heaven and hell. Strong clangs battling heavenly strings. The sound effects are also satisfying clangs or metal or blood squelches.
+ (Content, Replayability) Covenant ranks extend the life of the game making you want to repeat it with added difficulties.
+ (Replayability) The game is quick to pick (back) up and I definitely will be coming back to it in the future to further my Covenant rank and get victories with primary/ally clan combinations that I haven't gotten.
+ Discovering new combinations of cards and then beating the game gives a good sense of accomplishment.

Best: Building up a massive multistrike backline and spikes frontline combo and destroying a boss.
Worst: It feels too much like Slay the Spire and so doesn't feel fresh. If I'd played this first, it probably would be the other way round.",1599483461,1606818925,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Much like Slay the Spire, you build a deck by drafting cards while navigating a map and engaging in battles, in this case, you are riding a train through the now-frozen 9 circles of Hell with the last vestige of the Pyre which can re-ignite Hell to it's former blazing glory.

What differentiates this is that you choose a combination of 2 factions, one which is your main and one your secondary.  The main faction will determine who your Champion, a special card, is while the combination of both will determine the contents of your starting deck.  The game consist of 8 multi-wave battles on your 4-level train as the forces of ""good"" try to climb its floors and extinguish your pyre which sits on the topmost floor.  You play cards either Units or Spells to defeat each wave until the boss Spawns.

Once you complete the game the first time, you unlock Covenant levels which are similar to Ascendancy levels.  Each subsequent level will give you penalties to make the run harder.

Another very nice feature is the ability to creature custom challenges that can be shared and played simultaneously among friends each challenge having their own leader boards.

The developers have no qualms about the fact that this game was inspired by slay the spire (going as far as offering a 20% discount for Slay The Spire owners at launch), but has a huge number of variations to make it a different game on its own. There is an extra element of strategy involved in unit placement (borrowed from tower defence games) which can make or break your run. In one of my runs, I got destroyed by a boss because I forgot that he can directly climb from floor 3 to floor 1 and floor 2 had my most powerful units.

Think if you could get Silent cards as the Ironclad and just laugh at your 999 defence only to face an enemy that deals direct health damage instead of shield damage.

If you need some better insight on the game, I'd suggest watching Northerlions YouTube, the egg is hilariously bad which makes you want to get the game just to do better.

Monster Train is a deck building rogue-like. Expect to play through the game many times (this isn't a bad thing). Here's how it works: You'll choose a primary and secondary faction to join you in your quest to protect your demon train as it travels through the tracks on its way to relight the pyres of hell. At each stop you'll face a boss and its minions. You'll play cards to bring out minions of your own. The object of each level is to keep the angelic minions from reaching the top of the train and destroying the last pyre of hell.

Okay, it may sound a touch confusing, but it's super easy to learn.

If you like deck building games, as I do, you'll probably like Monster Train. Each game can take up to an HOUR to play through, so it's similar to a digital board game in many respects. Maybe you make it to the pyres and relight them, probably you'll get killed by Fel ... or that ass with the bombs. But you WILL have fun along the way.

I really enjoy the thought and originality that went into creating this game, but it's hard to give this a solid 100% yes. The gameplay is a lot of fun. Clearly inspired by Slay the Spire, the objective is to defend your train by building a deck; from this deck you play creatures to a train with three different floors, or cast spells. After you pass your turn, the game almost works more like a tower defense; the enemy creatures attack, then your creatures attack, and then all the remaining enemies advance one floor upward, or fight it out with your pyre (sort of like your ""base"" in tower defense games).

You create a starting deck from two factions: a primary, and a secondary. The primary clan gives you a champion (one of two), a powerful and free creature which you always begin each combat with. Otherwise, what clan you pick only determines which cards you start with and which cards/relics will be available for the run. After this, you alternate between combat, and choosing one of two sets of rewards. Every third combat is a boss battle.

While the spells and creatures have some interesting interactions, and it can feel incredibly rewarding to pull off some of the combos, my main problem with this game is that it feels fairly limited in its challenges. Each level has only one or two sets of enemies to fight against, with an optional random ""modifier"" you can apply to make the fight harder in exchange for an additional reward. While these can create some interesting new challenges, ultimately, I found that quickly, it felt pretty, well, same-y. You either have a strong engine, or you don't. Once I get a strong engine/start, usually, I find the game becomes too easy (even at high ascension levels). If I don't, it's either a rough climb, or a quick loss. The bosses, while they have some variations on the same six possibilities (I believe there's two or three variants of two possible boss encounters, except the final boss, which is the same with three variants). 

It's hard to put my finger on exactly what it is about this game that doesn't quick click, in my opinion, like Slay the Spire did; because even in StS, there were only so many possible encounters. But I think if I had to pick a few reasons, they would be 1) that in each run, you're locked into the same reward-fight-reward-fight pattern, which feels a bit old after a while; 2) that your relics you encounter don't feel as rewarding as in Slay the Spire, as they often feel either too powerful, or not powerful at all (and thus, you can't use them to milk extra effectiveness out of how you play quite as much); and 3) that, while there are six factions to play with, each of which with their own unique champions and mechanics, ultimately, they all serve the same purpose: to spam huge buffs on one or two crucial units, which then carry the whole game for you.

That being said, the game has some great things going for it. The soundtrack is great, the devs seem responsive to player feedback, there are some multiplayer/community options (such as a ""race"" mode), and the gameplay is genuinely fun and unique. I would say this is definitely worth checking out if it sounds interesting to you, and you'll get your money's worth.

The aforementioned games approached lanes in their various ways, but the approach in Monster Train feels not only the most intuitive, but genuinely adds to the game's strategy and fun, while feeling streamlined instead of cumbersome.  Even without the lane mechanic, Monster Train would be an interesting and enjoyable card fighter, brandishing a personality that sets it apart from the saturated genre.  It's smooth, fast, interesting, fun, has professional quality and depth, and just downright feels good to play.  Definitely compels the ""just one more run!"" user experience that signals the hallmarks of a good game.  Highly recommended!

When starting out, it is best to experiment with each clan with the following recommendations:

*  When selecting units or spells  it is best to take the paths towards your primary clan.
*  When you only have spells or units from your support clan look for ones that offer the best utility.
*  You want to have a Tank, DPS, and some type of buff unity.
*  You will typically want to place your hero on the top or middle floor so you have time to setup floors.
*  Look to add units or spells that offer incant or buffs.
*  You typically want to take additional draws or add draw cards to your hand so that you can buff your primary damage units.
* For unit bufffs. you should prioritize add health to your tanks, and multistrike & damage to your damage heroes.
* For spells you should look to reduce the cost for your bigger spells, add endless to your best buffs or sweeping spells.
* Make sure to also remove the Train Stewards and starting spells.  I typically will add a damage / consume to spells and prioritize removing stewards first.

The skill ceiling gets progressively harder as you complete covenants with each level adding changes to the the play environment.  You will had to adjust your approach in order to put out the needed DPS and debuffs.

Monster Train is the best deckbuilding roguelike I've played, after Slay the Spire. The gameplay is a fusion of ""summoning followers"" style card games (MtG, Hearthstone), deckbuilding roguelikes (StS), and tower defense Games. 


[h1] PROS:[/h1] 
[*] [b]A lot of combinations.[/b] There are 5 classes, and in each run you have one as the main and one as the sub. So there's 20 different combination of ways to play with each classes' unique and interesting mechanics. After almost 10 hours, I haven't even tried the last class yet, as there is so many combinations to explore. 

[*] [b]Much less ""grindy"" combat.[/b] In StS, some of the beginning rounds can be absolutely boring to play. Monster Train solves this by having every fight have a boss at the end, and reducing the amount of fights needed to win.

[*] [b]The UI.[/b] Everything is clear, everything can be learned from the UI. You don't even need to do maths, the UI does it for you. One of the best game UIs I have ever seen.

[/list]

[h1] CONS:[/h1] 
 [*] [b]Balancing issues.[/b] Due to the insane amount of combinations, this was to be expected. The game is still new as of the time I'm writing this, so maybe the devs would work on the balancing. Holdover, Multistrike are two of the upgrades I find absolutely broken. One of the most broken card imo  is ""Unleash the Wildwood"", a 0 cost green card that heals everyone to full. At the first glance, I assumed it consumed the card. 

[*] [b]Weird Difficulty Curve.[/b] Imo, the early game is more difficult than the late game. Most of the time when you reach the Seraph (final boss), your deck is strong enough to beat him easily. However, in the earlier battles, you sometimes take so much damage in the first few battles, and it usually is completely out of one's control. Due to summoned creatures not recycled into the discard, some games, especially in the early game, can be over when your champion dies. 

[*] [b] Randomness affects runs too much.[/b] Compared to StS, there are much fewer chances to add cards into the deck, so the likelihood of the run getting ruined by bad rng is higher. Starting from Covenant 1 (this game's version of Ascension), you get random cards added to the deck at the start of runs. That can ruin the run, or make it really easy. Also some events are busted, like the make 5 duplicates of a card event. 

[*] [b]The sound[/b] It can be really annoying for the boss fights. Maybe add an instant end effect.

[/list]

Despite its flaws, Monster Train is still an amazing game, and I believe it would keep improving. At of time of this review, I have been playing at the difficulty of Covenant 1/2, so my opinions are based on that.",1591419675,1606524251,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game's dual-clan system adds a lot of replayability in a genre that already lives of it. With a flat 10 different clan combinations and several playable build for each, many hours can be spent to just explore what suits your playstyle. The clans themselves are varied, althought I'd say the power difference between some are a bit steep (sorry Hellborne, you suck). The most interesting difference in my opinion is the use of a three-floor stage, further adding to the strategic complexity. You can split units evenly amongst them, leave some open for AoE spells, overstack the top floor etc. Higher difficulties can directly impact the floor system, which in my opinion are some of the most penalties.

The downside, in my humble opinion, is the aestethics. The music is fair enough, some soundtracks are actually awesome, but the graphics is unappealing to me. It's polished enough, but somehow it reminds me of a mobile game. Not enough to keep me away from playing it, thought.

So if you're looking for a strategy game that can be played in relatively short bursts for months to come, or if you really liked Slay the Spire, don't hesitate. Totally worth it even at full price as a lot added content has been free!

This game can be very easily compared to slay the spire as it shares many basic features, however this game notably allows you to combine different factions for various synergies and strategies. Also unlike STS this game involves the placement of minions rather than attacking directly. The battles in this game take place on several vertically stacked fields, where enemies that arent killed or hindered ascend each round. Due to these features there is a lot more strategizing to be done in this game than in STS. 

The only thing I remotely dislike is the visual style of the game, it can be a little inconsistent and some of the animations don't make sense or don't have the correct weight to them. Rector Flicker's lanterns specifically don't make much sense, they seem to float around a little,  and the Hornbreaker prince's weapons slide around in his hands in an odd way.

Replayability - with 5 clans, and 2 variable starting champions each (as well as 3 different upgrade paths you can mix), there are so many options to build a deck around. Plus, cards in this game don't have set upgrade path(s) but you can purchase from a relatively large pool of upgrades, furthermore increasing variability in the decks you can make. Like StS, there is mod support, so the game will only become even bigger. Also, I quite enjoy the daily challenges and comparing scores with friends and looking at the different strategies others have used successfully to beat the same run.
Mechanics - There is greater depth in the game mechanics compared to its peers. You have to consider not only mana and card advantage, but also the different floors and space/room on each floor (playing umbra for the first time made this painfully clear). There is more to think about regarding the path you take, like do you want to upgrade your spells or your creatures? Do you take the challenge in the upcoming battle for a chance at a greater reward (maybe trading pyre health for additional gold/score)? Is that challenge feasible for your current deck? How do I best combine the strengths of the two current clans? Coming from a guy who has put hundreds of hours into StS, compared to this game, StS is quite ""barebones"".

You'll love this. I didn't even wait for a sale, it's that good.

PROS: More complex than Slay the Spire. You pick a MAIN/ASSIST each time, so you have more combos to replay. There's also a difficulty scale that increases the encounters with more rewards. AND each mini boss has a challenge if you toggle it you get more rewards. 

Trinkets/artifacts/etc are often RNG 

The FINAL BOSS is pretty meh. It just feels like another mini boss but this is on lower levels, I haven't worked my way up yet.

So far this is actually MORE fun than Slay the Spire, but that may be the 'newness' of it. It clearly took a lot of inspiration from that game in all the best ways.

So yeah, if you liked Slay the Spire buy this now, don't even wait for a sale. You'll love it.
