And if it weren't for the dozens or even hundreds of hours I've spent playing Civ3, coupled with fatigue from its limitations and dumb AI ‚Äî Civ4 could, potentially, became my favourite instalment in the whole series. Looking back, the fourth part seems to be the most polished and competent iteration of the iconic franchise. Especially if you compare the basic versions, without the paid DLC and add-ons, which the creators of the series are so like to abuse nowadays. Sid Meier's Civilization IV inherited the best features of its predecessors, polished its mechanics and made a lot of small changes and improvements to the well-established formula. Thanks to a much more user-friendly and informative interface, fancier graphics, mature stylistics (hello to cartoonish Civ6 and Revolution) and FullHD resolution support ‚Äî the project looks and plays pleasantly to this day. And the amount of starting content, old and new civilizations, as well as the presence of alternative leaders are surprising. Of the drawbacks, I could mention the traditionally inadequate behaviour of the AI (especially when playing at marathon speed on huge maps with the maximum number of opponents), as well as the ""unfair"" difficulty, which increases not via the ""cunning"" AI, but through a system of bonuses for computer opponents and penalties for the player. But both of these problems are the scourge of the entire series, which the developers have successfully ignored for over two decades. Despite its solid age, Sid Meier's Civilization IV is a great starting point for getting to know the series, especially if you're not interested in online multiplayer. Unlike the newer instalments, Sid Meier's IV is much less demanding in terms of hardware and finances but is just as addictive.",1707823392,1707823392,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately 5 will always be my preferred option due to combat alone. Seriously, combat in 4 (BTS) is awful, and significantly holds the game back in my opinion. I come back every once in a while, but I never stay long. Recommend if you're looking for a cheap/ low spec entry to the franchise or prefer background complexity over proper turn based combat. This game blows the whole franchise out of the water until a war starts, which depending on your playstyle might not even be a large portion of the game. God combat fucking sucks though, whose idea was it to make air power useless at a certain strength % against ships?

-Most people have their hours in BTS, disregard mine. I don't have a ton on for 4 anyways but it was the first I got not counting Revolution, so the rose tinted glasses hit hard.

Also Take Two is a genuinely shitty company, and you'll have to agree to their privacy policy to get in. I don't hate valve, but you could probably just pirate a copy without all that jazz. Beyond that, I genuinely don't think Firaxis or 2k have earned your money anymore, seeing what they spent it on for 6. The game is practically live service at this point, and civilization 7 probably will be. If you're really committed to doing things the legal way I'd work through GoG and minimize the profit made off of you, they also have Alpha Centauri which is quite probably the best IP with Sids name on it. Even if you have plenty to spare, respect your dollar more; it's the only power you have in the digital marketplace.

Blue thumb instead of red thumb because it's definitely a good game, and I generally agree with the arguments that the franchise started going downhill from here (5 is still my favorite, but that's after modding it to be more like 4). I just promise that unless you're one of the old spergs high off of Adderall and nostalgia you're going to hate combat and wish it were skippable.

As a leader of one of the eighteen civilizations of the base game (that can become even more with the two expansions, Warlords and Beyond the Sword) the player is expected to explore the surrounding lands (in a potentially procedurally generated map) and expand their city borders, found new cities or conquer others to gradually become an empire and eventually win a campaign that spans from the stone age to the near future of 2050. Victory can be achieved in many ways, from being the first civilization to reach outer space, to remaining the only civilization that is left on the map. The most interesting and addicting factor of Civilization IV are the choices the player takes, each one leading their civilization‚Äôs progress in a different direction. The technology tree is interesting and varied, allowing to focus on military prowess in one game or scientific progress in another; each choice could be the better one, depending on the map, the adversaries and the success in building world wonders or founding religions. Accompanying these potentially endless games are decent graphics that are clear to understand despite the complexity of the system and an incredibly (and award winning!) soundtrack. The Warlord expansion adds six more civilizations, more leaders and unique scenarios to the main game, but is otherwise unremarkable. The Beyond the Sword expansions is a lot better, adding ten more civilizations, more leaders, more unique scenarios and late game buildings; it also adds natural disasters and expanded victory conditions, making the end game a lot more interesting.

Do they run well on a laptop from 2013 with no gaming optimization and charging port you need to use duct tape to make work? No, I thought not. This game fucking rocks. It is the George Clooney of 4X strategy games: a charismatic grey fox that only gets better with age. Everyone else may have moved on, I say let them. There's only one civ game that's number 1 in my heart, and that's Civilization 4.",1695477475,1695477475,True,17,2,0.687272906303405762,1,True,False,False

The system is deep and nuanced, allowing players to use a variety of tactics to achieve their goals, from coercion and bribery to charm and flattery. The system also takes into account each civilization's unique characteristics, creating a dynamic and unpredictable playing field.

In addition to its gameplay, Civilization IV also boasts stunning visuals and a beautiful soundtrack that immerses players in the game's world. The attention to detail in the game's design is impressive, from the unique unit models to the lush environments and cityscapes.

Overall, Sid Meier's Civilization IV is a true masterpiece of the strategy genre.

1. My playtime is a lie. Beyond the fact that the DLCs act as standalone games, and your playtime on them doesn't contribute to the base game, I also owned the CD-ROM version back in the day, and played it until disc rot made it literally unplayable.

2. The base game isn't the definitive way to enjoy this game. Get the Beyond the Sword expansion, because you're honestly doing yourself a disservice if you don't.

Now, onto the review.

I am a historian. It's an integral part of me. It's what I've studied, it's what I explore in my free time, it's what I can talk about for hours without a pause. Civilisation 4 is a large part of the reason why. It came out when I was pretty young and I was always terrible at it, but for hours an hours on end, after I came home from school, I would play Civ 4. Hundreds of hours. Thousands of hours. I played this game for [b]years[/b] almost religiously. As mentioned above, the CD-ROM I played it on eventually succumbed to disc rot because of how much I was handling it.

Even without Civilisation's long and impressive pedigree, this is quite possibly the perfect historical 4x game. It's easy to jump into at low levels, but with layers upon layers of strategy to dig down into. The graphics are aged, sure, the sound design is rough around the edges, and even through my extremely rose-tinted glasses I can acknowledge that it has its jank and weird moments, but getting through that rewards you with an endlessly replayable experience, always fresh, always there, always ready for you to make your mark on the world. It [b]oozes[/b] charm and care. The technology quotes are narrated by the late Leonard Nimoy for Christ's sake! (One of his only non-Star Trek related video game credits alongside Kingdom Hearts, funnily enough.)

I still go back to it, year after year. Partially out of nostalgia, yes, but also because it hooks me like no other Civ game really can. Civ 5 is excellent, yes, and SM:AC probably some of the best science fiction ever put into video game format, but Civ 4 will always be my beloved.

And, if you've somehow extracted all the dopamine from the base game, fear not. The modding community for this game is prodigious, and it even comes bundled with a few of them to give you a taste. My personal recommendation, if you find the base game too slow or not detailed enough, is the truly ludicrous mod of Caveman2Cosmos.

I say this as someone who has played every civilization game except for Civ VI. I got the original game as a birthday present from my parents and became obsessed with each one since, so I know the strengths and weaknesses of them. The early civilization games were good, but had flaws. For instance, if you screwed up even a little bit, your game was finished. Never ending wars were a constant issue in civ 1-3 to the point where it became like Orwell's 1984; ""we were always at war with Ghandi..."" It was only truly fixed in this game where peace treaties became binding and it was not possible to cross borders without an open borders agreement (in the old games, you could keep troops in your opponent's territory and they would have to tell you to get out or declare war, after which most AI would declare war). So Civ 4 (this game) fixed these issues whilst still retaining the core gameplay which was utterly decimated in Civ V and newer versions. Later versions changed the core gameplay a lot and added complexity which doesn't really complement the game at all. Most people were happy that unit stacks were removed (i.e. you could no longer have 20 riflemen, 10 artillery, and 5 catapults on one tile) and with other changes to how combat works, but I feel that it ruined the game. It made combat more strategic in a way, but also more complicated in a bad way for gameplay & enjoyability. It's hard to describe exactly why, but Civ IV had the best of both worlds: the beginning of improvements that made civ better whilst also retaining the game mechanics and spirit of the old civ. 

Oh, and I actually have 300 hours on this game, plus a bit more from when I owned it before having a steam account. I don't know why, but it reset my hours when I reinstalled this game on my new PC.

With this fourth attempt, the series has cleaned up almost all of its old shortcomings. The interface is nearly as streamlined as gameplay this complex will allow, and the controversial ‚Äústrategic resources‚Äù from [i]III[/i] have been made more plentiful and less decisive. In fact, due to overhauls of several mechanics, especially combat, this is probably the most balanced these games have ever been. It feels more organic than past titles as well ‚Äì large cities spill out into adjacent tiles, the spread of religion across societies is only moderately controllable, and there are more numerous and interesting options for government style, unit promotion, and Great Person behaviour. The only remaining issues that aren‚Äôt endemic to the genre (such as game speed) are in the presentation. Outside of the famously incredible title theme, the music is quite boring, there are some odd sound effect choices, and the jump to 3D visuals had mixed results.

But games like solitaire and the ubiquitous merging games found on cell phones and computers today simply bore me to tears.  I have been playing Civilization from when the very first edition came out in 1991.  I welcomed CIV II and CIV III, but the advent of CIV VI gave me the strategy game I really was looking for.

I play CIV IV because it gives me the opportunity to win by diplomacy, cultural spread, and the space race as alternatives to outright war against the other civilizations. I play just the desktop mode, and generally customize to run the largest maps with marathon speed to let me really get into micromanaging the cities and units in games that might take me months to win, depending the real life time I have available to me.  

For me it is the journey  I take in developing my civilization, rather than the winning over the others that I enjoy.  I set the game to always be in a state of peace (which I know is unrealistic) and dive in to the complexities of diplomacy and culture to either work together with the AI's civilizations or to entice them to join me through my culture development (usually by culture bombing the border cities by having Great Artists move to those locations and creating their Great Works). 

I have yet to find another strategy game that caters as much to those players who don't enjoy warfare focused games as they do to those who are more interested in military conquest.

Hearts of Iron IV and Ark: Survival Evolved being those two other games. It was a Mitigation measure to ensure i wouldn't spend a whole night playing due to the sheer craftsmanship of these 3 Games that would keep me at my keyboard thinking about what to do next. it's a diplomatically polite way to admit to the Addictive properties behind the Designs of all three Games. HOI4 was the first inclusion but without thinking I had no doubt Civilization IV already stirred the same experience from the whirlwind of a mind under Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD, thou very mild and mitigated when the ""Hyperfixiation"" symptom that Asperger's Syndrome is known for comes into play).

good buy for only 5-7 USD in a Steam Sale for every Expansion. Beyond the Sword Especially i Consider the Definitive Civ 4 Expansion since Warlords and Colonization were likely more of a Gameplay Experiment.

Might of Been the Nintendo Switch Version as my only Experience of Civ VI but the Cohesion of the Experience Especially when Compared to Civ IV... It did not hold up. the same song being used through the entire game with different time period sound fonts felt like a broken Record and at some points I don't know when it transitioned to Another Era. At least Civ IV had a Better soundtrack for this from it's own Ancient tracks and Antiquity down to the Rennaisance and Medieval Pieces from Public Domain. Civ III Tracks even made it in. VI barely felt like a True Sid Meier's Civ game though i can blame that on my General Incompetence with a Controller and the Tech and Cultural Trees Feeling Awkward. Also used to IV's Squares instead of Hexagons. I Felt like the Map Needed to be Bigger, i Ran out of Room quick in a my Capitols to Build Manufactories and I had a Whole Continent to myself in the New World. 

It Hit uncanny Valley when i went to China to Sent an Embassy there and Realized that not only Qin Shi Huang was the leader of China instead of a Later dynasty like the Ming or Qing but that They Had Bullet Trains in the Early 1900s (I was Expecting WW1) and that the Hunnic Migrations never Quite had it's Consequences End with the Poles being Further West then the Vistula (The Rabbit Hole that Is Studying the Fall of Rome to see How it could Repeat when MIT (that Massachusetts Institution of Technology) Literally Predicted not that long Ago that Society will collapse Bronze Age style Within this Century). At Least Gilgamesh was a Good Friend when they Founded the New World in the Late 1800s. At least somewhat predictable in the Event that Medieval Europe never was subjected to Muslim Expansionism since Discovery was Fueled by the Fall of Constantinople and the Sheer Will to Bypass the Silk Road under Ottoman Control. Yes Learning History is something else i do to Stave boredom like it's the Plague and i found many Humors while doing so; Plague doctor jargon aside to the Blood letting table. suppose i'm such a late bloomer that i only now think of the idea of making custom scenarios. ideas are a dime a dozen and products and prototypes are the Gold of the Gold Standard that Backs a Worthy Suggestion. I digress my rant, my ADHD turns me into an Abraham Lincoln and Vladimir Putin when it comes to Keeping the Unions between Country-states together and keeping a concise meaning in a world wall of the different shades of print

Better experience over graphics any day would happen to be the Bias i Shine like a Motto at. the Tier list war amongst the Franchise Playerbase has convinced me thoroughly that Civ 4 is the Best Civ Game. if it wasn't for that i would have never come to know that IV was the Final and Apex of Sid's work; Akin to How Final Fantasy 9 was Composer Nobuo Uematsu's Final Game (where he composed solely, he was passing 10 to a successor concurrently) and in his own words ""Magnum Opus"" though i Consider FF6's Soundtrack to be the Best.

A: Yes I turned on comments because a Humanly debate amuses me when video games fail to accomplish the ole Roman Bread and Circus mechanic used by most modern deep states and Our Civilization's Very own Political Machine.

3900,102860627,76561198326827953,0,9,950,0,866,1660741721,"   The Civilization series's marvellous! Perfect if you want to just chill, drink coffee, relax, and multi-task; since it's a turn-taking game. This is the one you want if your computer can't quite run Civilization 5 properly and it's the one you buy when Civilization 3 is just too primitive for you. Yes! This one's sure got a bundle of a bunch more spice than Civilization 3; however if you're looking for less of a challenge then turn back, right now. The A.I. still practically does almost everything it can do in it's power; once the planet-map's made; to completely work against you.. The only way I've discovered of keeping up to them and becoming somewhat of a super-power-nation, is to go with the flow; and hope to Jesus Christ that you've got some really great resources in the early game. (You want either a massive river or river-system/delta, you want one of your cities to be on the coast with fish, or/and any amount of stone/copper/iron/silver/gold/gems/diamonds in your close-reaching-grasp.) ((Big fertile lands of rivers with great farmland is just perfect for building up a large population to get things done or simply to raise a simple/large army/navy; although, you're definitely going to want at least one city in your empire to be on the ocean with some sort of type of fish... And don't forget to go nuts over things that either bring you much money: or things that'll upgrade the quality of your peoples' tools/weapons.)) A small army with an abundance of copper can easily annihilate a massive army of simple people who don't have access to creating bronze weapons out of a certain tin/copper consistency. I hope the game takes into account that hardened bronze takes at least 3 years to become hardened to almost it's maximum potential. It'd be even more silly if you had stone walls before the enemy tried breaking in with their soldiers, armed with bronze weapons: because if you researched archery and have some guys with bows/arrows in your walled-city - it can be crazy-difficult for the enemy to break into that. So, no... You really don't need copper and tin to become powerful, though, you need them to make bronze if you're going on the offensive. Which reminds me, if you choose to make your nation a slave-trade, which happens in the early game: after researching the ability to have bronze, you can become a slave-trade. I highly recommend that you do become a slave trade if you want to be successful at an incredible rate because it's simply one of the steps Mankind has to take in order to compete strongly with many other nations of men. (It's practically the only way to become a strong super power in the early game which usually means you actually have a shot at survival; I've done many games without doing the slave-trade thing and it always ends up with my nation getting left in the dust and fighting off against hoards of barbarians or simply getting erased by an enemy nation, who did decide to become a slave trade.) ((But to become a super successful slave trade, towering over all of your enemies, nearby: you absolutely need a source of copper connected with roads to your most military-enhanced city; which's usually got to either be your capital city or one that you created a barracks in, right off the bat.)) As far as becoming an extremely massive slave-trade, you really need to conduct assaults with the dudes who have bronze, 2-handed, axes.. Often just a few of these bronze-axe-men combatant armies can, easily and absolutely, wreck an enemy nation who isn't immersed with an amount of abundant copper. It's necessary to conquer these militaristically 'weaker' nations because: as a slave trade; you need to enslave many other people, you can't be enslaving many of your own people or there'll be turmoil in the streets and wonders of your own empire! As a slave trade, you must conquer at least one other nation; no matter how kind they are; or suffer radical and economic collapse. This is how you can become an economic powerhouse in the early times of the world or be prepared to be easily picked off a tree and eaten by; barbarians, your own people, or/and another slave-trading empire: it's practically like this anyway... To tell you the truth, complex strategy and being responsive in many ways are how you take off from being a slave trade. Choose a good religion for your people which suits the overall strategy of you and your empire. If you don't go a strong religious route and are not very successful in becoming a good and quite religious empire; then be prepared for your empire to go into revolution after revolution against you. I personally, always try to hit religion at the same time that Christianity is introduced in the game-match; it's also alright to take that religion from another nation: as long as you end up on top of them, at some point; power-wise. If your nation's the one that Christianity happens in via enabling a bit of liberty so it's much more possible - then you have the best ability to subdue the other nations, both with peace, obligations, or simply war. If your nation's the first Christian nation; you've really got the game in the bag and you really ought to save the game right then and there. I say this because the rest of the game's going to require much more, complex and responsive, immensely great strategy and tactics. Pick up as much iron as you can by this time; you need to prepare for the era of the future world wars: if they even erupt. You have to get ready to make complex machinery on an industrial level; definitely become a monarch along the way, too. You need oil deposits. If you don't have at least 2 deposits of iron connected with roads to your military production centres; and if you don't have at least one deposit of oil connected in the same way; you don't stand a chance in a world war. Become a thinker like an industrial revolutionary leader!!!!! If you don't have at least 2 units of infantry and at least one unit of some sort of combat-vehicle; like tanks, bomber-planes, or artillery: then go back to that save file that I told you to make, earlier. If you don't; then if a world war happens: and it's highly likely in this game: you're getting stomped and your nation will belong to another in a hurry. For the amount of raw, non-politically-correct, and difficult: realism: I give this game a 10/10. It really doesn't need the hottest graphics and sure lacks a bit in the quality of the sprites and what you get visually: this game isn't even for a wide screen monitor.. But, for what it's taught me about just how competitive you need to be as a people; in order to survive for thousands of years, even making choices that're considered major mistakes today: in order to maintain your people on a competitive level... I will not take off any of my rating for the lack of great visuals. (It's not the worst game on a graphic and visual level, but it could sure use a wide-screen version.) You're all the very best for reading my review and dedicating your time to check out my profile! Thank you all very much for your time and energy, take care, have a good time, stay safe, enjoy, and good bye for now!!

I have a windows  10 operation system.... I'm sorry Steam but if you are offering these games off your platform then you should ensure they work. I cannot get this game to work (and i have tried at least 2 fixes off the community page so far) and from a platform (such and yours) that  is offering classic games such as this and others, it should work through your platform. i love the civilization series but if your going to sell these nostalgic games and not ensure that they function on all Systems that is a real problem.... 
it's like selling a used car and  asking full price on that used car that is broke down and not working and you nor fixing it and telling the owner to just ""figure it out""
A honestly another thing....The system of reporting glitches in your platform is the biggest most ridiculous thing...in that it is practically non-existent!!!!!!  and i hate to say it if it's some legal issue say 2k or firaxis games won't let you modify code in the game to make the game function on modern systems....then they are really dumb. cause that means a loss in profits for yourselves and possibly them....i guess by some proxy maybe.",1636730346,1636730346,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

You balance the development of your cities' infrastructure, the quantity and quality of your military, your research projects, and trade routes. And using whatever means you can, you vie for victory by achieving any of a variety of victory conditions, such as being the first to colonize space or by becoming the uncontested global superpower.

I played the balls absolutely off of Civilization II back in the Windows 98 days. It was an exceptional game for its time. But Civilization IV became my favorite entry into the late 2000s. The territory game mechanic in particular was a much appreciated improvement, in addition to graphical, UI, and music modernization efforts.

I only ever have two complaints with Civ IV, or with most of the Civilization games, One, that city management over long periods of time can be obnoxious to micromanage. It can be time consuming and aggravating to try and keep your cities keeping up with their infrastructure, and some of the later AI improvements to help automate this aren't always the best. Two, sometimes you get absolutely whacked by a large number of units that appear suddenly out of nowhere deep within your territory. I wish Civ IV had the mechanic included in even older Total War games to reduce this frustration, namely the ability for military units to construct watchtowers to maintain visibility (instead of requiring engineers to build forts).

In single playthroughs, these are not nearly enough to eliminate the fun of the game. But it does prevent playability without long breaks of time in between game installs.

Pros:
+ Nice graphics (for its time)
+ Nice UI (for its time) and map navigation
+ Large variety of Civs, Units, and city buildings
+ Hatshepsut is a cutie

Cons:
- Micromanaging can be exceptionally time consuming, which can make longer games boring, and hurts replayability
- You can't build watchtowers with military units to help with map visibility, guaranteeing that large stacks of enemy troops will somehow zip past your suburbs to whack you deep behind the actual front.

Rating: A- (for its time), B+ (for 2021)

At its normal price of $19.99? It's not worth it in 2021. But it regularly goes on sale for 70 or 70% off. At that price its a no brainer if you like turn-based strategy games.",1631333018,1631333285,True,3,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

I play Civ V and Vi on Emperor difficulty, but that proved too much of a challenge for me while learning Civ IV. Like other civilization games, civ IV has a built in civilopedia, and I recommend you use it, or the online version, whenever you discover a new social policy, building, or anything else that intrigues you. If you enjoy the process of learning a game, Civ IV is rich in mechanical complexity, perhaps even more so than its sequels, but you are by no means required to understand all of it on your first, or even your third, playthrough.

I wound up getting this game again during the Summer Sale for nostalgia, and was pleasantly surprised to find it still held up 15 years (!) after release!


Music: Great quality, great selection, not to mention the Grammy-winning ""Baba Yetu"" as the main menu theme. 9/10.

Graphics: Dated, but very well detailed on max settings. Mods like Blue Marble exist that push things even further. 7/10.

Gameplay: Many consider this the best Civ game, including me. Civ IV gave this series its modern look and feel, and it is a formula that is still in use even with Civ VI, 15 years later. Where this loses its point is the lack of an interactive tutorial for new Civ players, but the Civilopedia is useful to help with this. 9/10.

Learning curve: Easy if you've played a Civ game before, hard to learn if you haven't. The Civilopedia has some info, but you'll need to figure some stuff out yourself. 7/10


Final Point Tally: 32/40 (Excellent)

Final Verdict: Buy this game. The expansions are not needed but will enhance the playthrough further, though they are not compatible with each other (to my knowledge). I had some issues downloading Beyond the Sword right away, though leaving it in your account for a few days should be enough to get it to work.",1593913141,1593913141,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a bit hard to talk about Civilization IV today. In many ways, Civilization IV is, you see, arguably the last genuinely great Civilization game. In many ways, its successor, Civilization V, is a superior game--more polished, more focused, with greater depth and better balance--and the definitive Civilization experience. But at the same time, I can't help but lament how unambitious subsequent Civilization games are--and that lack of ambition seems to be a patter currently affecting all of developer Firaxis' output. Rough around the edges though it may be, Civilization IV is still a fantastically engrossing and addictive turn-based grand strategy game, with hugely ambitious standalone expansions that radically transform the core rules and mechanics. Going back into Civilization IV today, one might be disappointed by the lack of modern polish--most especially the absence of tooltips and proliferation of awkward iconography in their stead--but despite it's self-evident age, I think Civilization IV still stands proud as a landmark 4x game.

And if Civilization IV on its own does not merit revisiting in the wake of Civilization V, its expansions--most notably Beyond the Sword--most certainly do.

Do you will be able to master the history?

In my opinion it is the best game of the civ brand.
In this one is introduced for the first time the world religions aspect, that was absent in civ III, are perfected the government forms meccanics (is up to you what to chose), the diplomacy with other nations and the different resources that you can find on the world map.
All those aspects are related togheter and more tattical oriented.
The tecnological tree is more deep and interconnected. To search for a tecnolgy, before of an other, have a real strategical meaning now.
The militar units choice is more tattical then civ 3 and 5. You can put more then 1 unit for square and you have to chose the unit on the base of the use you will do of it, giving so a deeper strategy  then the other games where a tecnological advanced militar unit was taking all others obsolete and meaningless.
Plus is added a better veteran promotion bonuses sistem.

You can personalize your games in many aspects, you can set the game speed and dimension on your taste.
There is a multiplayer section where you can iven play in two players directly on your computer.

From the graphics to the sounds to the gameplay.  While its not perfect I believe it is worth it for a low price.  I prefer this game over all other Civ computer games, although Civilization Revolution is by far my favorite it is only for console and I am tired of playing it.  I have played it so much.  I have also played Civ 4 PC a lot, way more than steam shows, because I also have the CD version of the game installed.  That is because I prefer to mod it and the steam version is not as mod-friendly IMO.  Although it can be I suppose if you install it to something like C:\civ4\ or some easily accessed directory.   Being able to modify most aspects of this game is really awesome.  It really is a game changer.

I have figured out that if you use custom continents and use tiny map and 4+ continents and only 2 other civs the game can be quite good.  It is a grind though.  I wish I had another human to play this with it would be awesome, however it is a huge time commitment and you will find it extremely hard to find someone to commit that time at the same time, as you.

Also I have modified the XML to remove all leader traits and change a couple unbalanced early game units.

I am liking a lot of the music in this game now, but not all of it, but I am modifying that as well since you can easily replace the MP3's in the game folder.

Well below here is my negative review, it is kind of funny, but true..  after I finished my first super long space race victory game..... space race in this game isnt for me, it's very tedious and feels like a chore, espcially compared  to Civ revolutions.... I was super suprised at all the global warming near the end of the game, LOL, I guess it was because of all my coal plants and and a few nukes detonated over China capital, lol... I have now modified the global warming chance also in the XML files.... seriously though it was out of control there was like 3-4 tiles every turn turning to desert in my main cities and it was pissing me off big time...
------------------gonna leave it for fun---------------


I have bought this but mainly played Warlords, however it is basically the same thing.  As a huge fan of Civilization 3, I wanted to like this game so much.  The graphics are well done, and the camera does not allow rotation which I much prefer in any strategy game.

  Of course the first thing I noticed is the game is totally unbalanced.  The Africans get an attacking unit right at the start that can move 2 spaces and other civs cant move 2 spaces for like 200 more turns.  The ""industrious"" leaders all get a +50 or is it 100% bonus to great wonder building speed.  Why is that unbalanced?  Well because this game is 70% building great wonders there is a great wonder for almost every technology.  These types of things are  unacceptable in a strategy game really and I noticed they have all been fixed in Civ 6.  Well, what I did is I modified the XML files of this game.  It is surprisingly modifiable and that is a plus.  Of course you can't modify a lot of things and it is a hassle to figure out.

Okay lets talk about the audio.  You have Nimoy narrating which is fine with me, but when he tries to joke, awkward.  The sounds when managing cities, which you have to do alot, are annoying.  The music system is rediculous.  So what happens is it plays the ""world theme"" unless you zoom in, and then it plays your ""civilization theme.""  It gets louder and softer depending on your zoom level, and there is a spot in between where it plays no music basically.  This is also the spot where the graphics look the best but its still playable.  Now if you play it zoomed out like most you are going to find the ""world theme"" to be not very good, and when it changes to the modern age you will have some disturbing modern classical ""doomed world"" theme to listen to.

Speaking of doomed world, the game tries very hard to make it feel that way, closer you get to the end, you will be bombarded with GLOBAL WARMING destroying your cities I kid you not.  Also on the ""Internet"" wonder they have a picture of AL GORE and I think they paid him to be in the game and use his global warming MYTH that I guess he has a copyright on?

Now lets talk AI.  The AI is just as bad if not worse than Civ 3.  Barbarians appear out of nowhere anywhere there is fog of war, as do other civilizations that attack you.  I don't think other civilizations have to even research or produce units in their cities at all.  Their units just show up out of the fog of war after a certain amount of turns.  Modifying XML files probably does not even affect a computer controlled opponent.  When in war, they will have maybe one invasion force, if you defeat that or they cant land or regardless they are going to go around just destroying your fishing boats and fishing spots.  Most annoying thing ever and not fun.  The AI will never attack you, until about 1850 AD and if you are winning, and then of course they will always declare war on you.  The enemy moves don't animate properly most of the time, leading to enemy just magically appearing without the camera tracking them or even showing them at all.  Due to the way the game shows multiple units there can be a huge force under one weak unit and you cannot tell.

Other forms of victory like space race is way too difficult and then the game just ends with no reward but a short crappy cutscene of you staring at earth from a window.  Nukes are underpowered and unsatisfying.  If you play the game with ""standard"" size map get ready for your game to last 100+ hours.  The map size changes on the type you choose and its really hard to create the right size map.  There are in reality no random maps there are continents, pangea, or waterworld, and one called fractal which I have found just creates continents or pangea.  I like to play maps with both continents and smaller islands and this game will not generate a map like that.

I highly recommend Civilization Revolutions over this, a great game for xbox 360, not perfect but way way better.",1560774096,1561033510,True,0,0,0.45649072527885437,0,True,False,False

What I want from a game is frequently being given lots of not-obvious decisions that matter, where the right answer can be deduced through careful thought and thorough knowledge of the game.  I'm wanting a game where these choices matter far more than the dice.  What I don't particularly care about are the graphics, the story, or the ""emersive experience"" of feeling like I'm really talking to Cleopatra.

In Civ IV, one worker option is cottages, which are the short-term loss/long-term gain option.  Civ IV balances it well enough that thinking long term isn't necessarily the right choice; you have to assess the odds of a war within 10-50 turns and think about it.

Another home-run is the civics.  Many of the options are niche-strategies, but collectively, it's likely that you should eventually choose a niche.  For instance, one average, theocracy is bad.  But sometimes, a war is coming, and the free experience motivates building an army and crushing someone.  Even in games where I don't do this, the fact that I had this option looming over every single turn from turns 100-200 drives home how open ended the game is for players who want to explore the frontiers of just how high of a difficulty level can be beaten.

Also more so than Civ V and VI, I find myself taking different tech paths each time, which helps keep the game fresh and different each time.  In Civ V, I quickly felt like I had found the ""right"" strategy, and was now only testing to see how far it could take me.

Turn based. Strategically place your cities to maximize growth and production, while seeking out game changing resources like iron, coal, and oil. Produce workers and settlers to work and expand your territory, various military units to give your empire the edge on the battlefield, and buildings to give your cities vital perks. Construct wonders grant bonuses and give an edge in many areas. Research technologies that boost your advantage over your neighbors. Spread your religion(s) through your own lands and those of other civilizations, giving you a common cause.

One of the parts that makes the game timeless. Immerses you in the current age, from beating on tribal drums to [i]Miserere mei Deus[/i] to Piano Concerto no. 20. And who could ever forget Civ IV's theme?

Even so many years later, Civilization IV is a classic. Lots of replayability, with two DLC that add new civilizations, units, wonders and scenarios. Full price or on sale, worth your pennies.

Civilization IV is a really fun game, based on a formula of expansion, growth, and conquest. However, it does have some flaws.

Graphics- The graphics on this game are, by all standards, nothing special, but a vast improvement over previous Civ titles. Besides, graphics in a strategy game aren't really the main focus.

Sound- The game has some great music tracks, which are era specific and usually appropriate. While the music does get a bit repetitive, I still haven't gotten tired of the opening title. The sound effects are pretty funny, which help contribute to the feeling that Civ4 is ""just a game"". A good thing, in my opinion. Also, Leonard Nimoy speaks to you every time you research a technology.

Gameplay- This is where Civ4 really shines. The game is really infinitely replayable, with infinite possibilities and completely ludicrous historical combinations to try! The city building and expanding mechanic is very solid, however combat needs A LOT of work. Battles are simplistic and very unbalanced at best, relying almost completely on numbers and tech level rather than strategy or practicality. I for one, feel that stone age spearmen should never be able to defeat attack helicopters. In addition to this, some of the civics and the entire religion mechanic are completely pointless, which is a shame, considering they could have been put to very good use. Ultimately though, the game is still very good, and very addictive. I give it an 8.",1388517815,1548189310,True,32,1,0.699809610843658447,1,True,False,False

The gameplay is pretty self-explanatory: you get to control a build one of the myriad world civilizations, and you must defend it and defeat your opponent. There are different ways to defeat your enemy, but it must be done before the time limit elapses. This s a turn-based game, which means after you play your turn, the computer plays its turn, and so on. Lots of different resources are available, for example gold, fish, iron, copper, ivory, stone, and more. With the passage of time, your civilization progresses from stone age all the way to the modern age. 

One of the major drawbacks of this game is the amount of effort and time that one must spend on managing the myriad resources in your territory; for example, if you assign villagers to cut down a forest, you must constantly check whether they have finished cutting a particular patch of the forest. After they are done, you have to order them to cut another patch of forest, for they will not do it automatically. Also there are so many different technologies and warrior upgrades available that it is very difficult to keep track of the prerequisites for each. For example, if I want to upgrade my arrowmen to crossbowmen, I must meticulously research the technologies/warrior required to get it done in the right sequence.  While the AI in this game is incredible, the difficulty of the game is extremely frustrating. Personally, I could not go past the third level of difficulty because of the ENDLESS twists and turns. And as I have mentioned before, this game is INSANELY addictive. For this reason I think the cons of this game outweight its pros.

It feels like the development of the cities is more realistic at the start, especially in the countrysides due to the whole cottage/hamlet/village/town aspect. That is so interesting to me, that you can build the beginnings of villages and towns. Civ 5 is great too, as it has a darker feel, and the strategy of single unit per hex is great. The ideologies make for some incredible end game world wars. Civ 6 did a nice job on the city regions, like campuses and so on. But if you want something simple that will surprise you if you've only played 5 and 6, then try Civ 4. For me, the lack of villages and towns in Civ 5 and 6 was always sort of confusing to me. I kept wondering if they were just implied within the farming communities or what. But Civ 4 eased my wounds.

Sid Meier's Civilization IV, however, was the crucial turning point of the game series, aesthetic and graphics-wise. Civilization IV also brung in new features such as a built-in and accessible World Editor, where you can assemble maps, and simultaneously place nukes in 2000BC to annihilate Gandhi incase he gains nuclear technology in the distant future.
It also brung in actual terrain, like hills, grasslands, 3D forests, mountains and even moving rivers! It also brought a huge modding community dedicated to updating this game with their own, such as Realism Invictus and Rhye's and Fall of Civilization.

Nonetheless, Civilization IV has some bad things. It essentially lost it's sterness and a little bit of realism after the implementation of easily accessible cheats, and kinda looks like something a young player would be on, hours and hours during the day. 

In conclusion, Civilization IV is the default turning point of Civilization, and effected the recent games such as Civilization V and VI.

Pros:
[list]
[*]Extreme modding flexibility. You can do some slight modification with XML, but man, you can do A LOT with python. The engine is so robust that you can play a fantasy world (Fall From Heaven 2), a civil war (RevolutionDCM), the neolithic age (Caveman2Cosmos) and so much more.
[*]Cities have their own identity. There's no bullcrap about some third world colony somehow making your citizens mad; not every war is Vietnam. Not to mention, culture is actually culture, foreign nationals will hate you and want to return to their country. This is further enhanced by RevolutionDCM.
[*]Your empire-building choices are diverse. There's no single answer to every choice you make; you have to design your cities to develop your country. You can move towards having industrial powerhouses, settle cities specifically for commerce and tax money, settle in far lands to establish cultural dominance, establish a corporate center, fill your coffers with the tithe of a holy city, feed your citizens specifically to enslave them, and so on and so forth. You have to work for your +50 gold, not click on some OP religious bonus.
[*]Your government is flexible. Communism and Fascism isn't fully fleshed out in the game probably for fear of poltical backlash, but all of the obsolete policies before modern government do have their merits. A caste system helps you with making sure you have a lot of merchants, slavery ensures you have fast production, mercantilism makes sure the benefits of trade isn't shared with your enemies.
[*]There is a war before war. Civ4 espionage and diplomacy is especially well-developed as there's no such thing as simple friend or enemy. Political blocs do exist, and there will be civs that support your power to ensure their safety, but they all have their intrigue to make sure you're not too powerful. Information war and proper war-planning exists in this game; if you don't have vision of your enemy's cities or units, you might end up with a severe counter of axemen destroying your swordsmen. Destroying your rival's economy can be done through espionage as well as poisoning the wells of their wonderful cities can hold them back, and yes, there is a chance for you to destroy a 1-turn progress towards building a wonder.

Cons:
[list]
[*]You need to think. Civ4 isn't dumbed down for the wide market like Civ5 or Civ6.
[*]You will lose track of time.
[*]No Steam workshop. This is an old game.
[*]Old graphics, but with the right mods it can be repaired.
[*]Turn times may get very slow, especially with huge mods like Caveman2Cosmos.
[/list]
Overall, I would only recommend this to gamers who know strategy or history very well. In my opinion, I think playing without victory conditions can be very fun as role-playing countries can be a wonderful experience, and developing mods can be a joy as Civ4 becomes your alternative history simulator.",1537312273,1537312273,True,29,8,0.676429092884063721,0,True,False,False

TLDR: Vanilla version of CivIV:Beyond the Sword. Play that instead for better covert ops, quest lines and more.

Civilization IV is a great place to go back to when wanting to see older mechanics and design choices in this series. However, given that the vanilla version of Civ IV is a simplified, more accessible version of Beyond the Sword. It is difficult to recommend it over the more recent Civilization games which also streamline those designs and mechanics.

So my recommendation would be to play a more modern Civ if you need to get past the learning curve or get familiar again with the basic mechanics, or go to Beyond the Sword for the full experience instead.

Civilization lets you take control of the first settlers who founded a nation on earth. Of course, not every nation is represented but the most important ones are. As you take control, you start in roughly 4000 BC. From there, you must expand your civilization by colonising new lands or capturing enemy cities. As you progress through time, you can research new technologies that benefit your empire. You empire is more than the sum of all of your cities and you also have technology, diplomatic relations, influence over land, terrain improvements and governement policies. You are the master of your civilization and how you play will dictate history itself.

In this version of Cilization, you have a 3D world for the first time. The graphics look nice and are obviously improved from Civ III. I haven't found any bugs in the game and the music is fantastic. They've used classical music mostly and it sounds great. There is no unit customization but the game has faction-specific units. As an example, the Americans have SEAL infantry, with unique strenghts. Otherwise, there are new wonders to build and the religious buildings are religion-specific. 

Overall a fantastic game, had a lot of fun. My 188h of playtime attest to that!",1532307682,1532307682,True,6,0,0.586403608322143555,0,True,False,False

Nostalgia aside, this is definitely tied for the title of ""Best Civilization Game"" with Civilization 5. There's a lot to like and there's some stuff to dislike about it. First, the positives.

The game looks like a game that came out in 2005 but it's not a bad looking game by any means. What you see in the screenshots on the Steam page is what it looks like in game. I also think that the game has a much higher learning curve compared to the newer iterations of the Civilization franchise, or at the very least compared to 5, BE, and 6. There's a lot more micromanaging in this game than the newer games. 

Moving on to the negatives, the game does feel very dated, and that becomes appearent at some of the mechanics. The movement isn't as good, since in Civ 4 they were still using square tiles, which makes some combat and movement feel terrible at times. The newer games have hexagonical tiles instead, and they're vastly superior to the square tiles of earlier games. But more importantly, the UI isn't that great. It can be a bit confusing, especially to newer players. 

Finally, some of the mechanics are completely barebone. There's a lot of stuff here to have fun with, but some mechanics aren't fleshed out enough (like city health) and just means that you have one more thing to micromanage instead of it being a completely different thing to keep track of.

Overall though, I would still recommend it because while it is starting to show its age, it's good enough that you can overlook some of the minor flaws that the game has. Also, it has one of the best soundtracks in the history of games period. Definitely pick this one up if you're a fan of 4X turn-based strategy games.",1521758885,1530327970,True,27,0,0.734476208686828613,0,True,False,False

Civilization takes place on a large strategic map, representing the entire world,  that's divided into tiles that each have their own features and terrain. War is waged by moving military units across these tiles.

The problem with 1UPT is a matter of perspective, and the matter of strategic vs. tactical combat. ""Strategy"" refers to the grand overall execution of a war by a nation's military, while ""tactics"" refers to the actions that a military unit takes in a single battle. A game series that's well-known for featuring both the strategic and tactical view of armies is Total War, and it shifts between the perspectives very well.

The problem is that Civilization does not shift between these perspectives (not that I really want it to, as I think that goes against the spirit of the game), so Civilization V and Civilization VI have tactical combat taking place on a map meant for strategic combat. In Civilization IV and all prior Civ games, you move your military units and when they meet an opposing force, RNG simulates what happens on a tactical level. It makes sense and it fits the strategic perspective of the playing field.

Civ5 and Civ6 use the same perspective, but the 1UPT restriction makes it so that on 1 tile, which represents a few hundred square miles, you have only one military unit. That doesn't make sense!

And I understand why there's a number of people who prefer it. They hate so-called ""Stacks of Doom"". In every Civ game through Civ4, you can have a theoretically infinite number of military units on one tile. These can quickly decimate a defending city's military if the stack of attacking units is large enough.

But that's the point!

If the enemy is able to defeat you with a stack of doom, then it's on you for not making your own stack to defend. Civilization isn't just about combat. It's also what happens between combat. It can also be about avoiding combat, if that's what you're going for. You need to build up the production of your cities, and then you need to produce wisely. Civilization is about more than managing a military, it's about managing your economy and infrastructure.

Forcing tactical combat on Civ puts too much weight on the military aspect of the game, since you have the headache of figuring out which military unit goes on which tile. And because Civ has ways to win the game peacefully, it goes against the spirit of the game to put that much weight on management of the military.

So, until Civilization reverses the horribly-flawed design choice of 1UPT, Civilization IV is still the prototypical Civilization game. It is the pinnacle of everything that Civilization is meant to be, and I hope that in time, Firaxis will understand the error of their ways and leave the 1UPT nonsense to games that are actually meant to be tactical combat games.

I have had more fun with Civ IV over the years, than I had watching the entire works of the cast of Monty Python and the infamous 5lbs Harebo ""Digestable"" Sugar  Free Gummy Bear review combined. The gameplay is phenominal. I think all other titles in the series pale in comparison, maybe bar Civ VI. If you're looking for a comparison of Civ IV to Civ VI, you won't find it in this post. That is because I enjoy both so equally right now, that I couldn't form an opinion of it if my life depended on it. The opening theme for Civ IV is amazing. I only recently learned that the lyrics to the game's opening theme translate to The Lord's Prayer, which is merely an interesting tidbit. Though I find the former interesting, in combination with the fact that Civ IV introduced  religion mechanics to the series. I doubt that that is a coincidence. This is the first Civ game I played to any level of seriousness or competency. I have sunk hundreds of hours into every Civ game since Civ III.

Fun, fast paced gameplay, extensive research trees, interesting tech that completely changes the landscape of the playing field. Being over a decade old, the visual aspect of the game is understandably lacking nowadays, but you see everything you need to. The extensive choice of rulers and perks that come with different civs is commendable. It provides the player with the feeling that they have much more control over the course of their civilization, and this gives a unique depth to the world. As is the standard with Sid Meier's video games, the player truly feels like they are discovering something never before seen when they trek the vast expanse of water in their Caravan for the first time. Multiplayer mechanic is a perfect platform for competitive players or cocky friends to challenge each other to a great, long run of civ and gives way to an incredible, unique experience that no other game can quite achieve. A truly unique game that spans across generations, and will surely be remembered for its incredible run as the go-to RTS game. I speak with a heavy dose of bias, and the game does suffer a bit from graphical glitches, bugs, the occasional crash, etc., but it's an experience everybody deserves to have at least once.

Which is something i plan on doing soon. I would recommend this game! Thanks for Reading, and have a nice day!",1466534570,1466534570,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

 it has a great 3D world with great detail and design as well; the HUD is very user friendly and nothing is hard to find. One of my favorite parts is when you complete a wonder, It gives you a nice animation showing the blue prints then the wonder being built. The units look great too, more so when battling other units.

 The camera angles can be a bit off sometimes but its not often; the customization is really good! You can change your nation's name and description; then pick what victories are allowed and which ones are not.

Moscow started as a small farming city. With little to no army but an expansive amount of fields and pastures. But soon enough we were running out of space. We decided to found 3 more cities all in the continet we resided in. After exploring the continent the Russians met two other Empire who lived nearby first was Asoka of India, and secondly was Saladin of Arabia. Asoka and Flazam became good allies, Russia would send some of are livestock from are farms and in return he would give us money.  For 1000 years we remained a humble farming civilization. That was until the scholars in Moscow came to there great leader Flazam II with some reseach. Gun Powder, this new discovery allowed are civilization great new oppitunties, and so in 1245 AD Russias militisation began. Are Armies grew with the most advanced soilders in the planet. Grenidiers, Riflemen galore. We gained a reputation so great two nearby Arabian cities revolted to join are Empire. Quickly Russia became the greatest military might, but still we remained close Allies with are neibhour Asoka, a relationship that had stood the test of time. Saladin however attempt to convert my people to Taoism and was spreading vile rumours about are wise ally Asoka. After hearing this news Flazam II got his noble stead and rode to Mumbai to discuss the pesky Saladin. it seemed India too resented him, therefore Flazam II gave are knowledge of gun powder to Asoka, with this gift Flazam II made a proposition. The Russia-Indian alliance should combine on a common enemy of Saladin and to unify the continet  under are great alliance. Therefore in 1348 war on Saladin was declared by both are nations. We quickly mobilised are troops on the eastern front storm 3 of Saladins cities adding them to are now vast empire. The war on the west was more vicious India was suffering some large casulties, therefore Flazam II sent some of the best fighters in are Empire from St Petersburg to aid in that front. With the help we pushed both fronts right back to the circumference of Saladins capital. In only 25 years Saladin was on his knees. India accept a treaty with Saladin. Flazam II was furious. India had left when we were so close. However Flazam II peristed the battle around Saladins capital was a bloody one. Lasting 40 years and draining the great Russian empire, slaves in St Petersburg were on strike and the War was begining to drag on. Therefore Flazam persuaded India to join the war once more in a final battle on the capital, and the famous Battle of 1 Turn occured. Saladin was destroyed and The Russia-India Alliance were victorious, but Flazam II still rembered how Asoka has betrayed him and the Alliance was on thin ice, Flazam II spent the next 300 years picking up the pieces of his problems in the Russian cities. The people demanded democracy and in the summer of 1789 Flazam II abdicated and was replaced by the New Russian president. Moscow was well known for its scientfic discoveries, and in 1867 we discovered Urianium and began the Manhattan project. Meanwhile over the past 200 years Asoka had entered a golden age with an empire far superior to ares. This competion began a Cold War with Russia the alliance broke down and times were tough. By the dawn of 20th centuary we had completed the Manhattan project and in 1920's the Cold War became increasingly serious. India mobilised troops round are borders and began sending spies. After India blockaded are Urianium farms the Cold War esclated and in 1935 the Russian president declared War on India, the next year we launched 3 nucleur bombs on Indias cities. India suffered but however they invaded are Urianium fields and launched a vicious offense. Russia was overwhelmed with a war on 5 fronts. And in 1977 we were on are knees all are cities were on the brink of revolution and Asoka had captured 1 of are cities. Russia pleaded with India and India agreed and the war ended albeit with a harsh treaty. India empire flourished as we attempt to pick up ares. In 2014 the Greek Empire was getting worryingly large. It was on a separate continet sharing there land with Mao Zedong. I negotiate with Mao. I asked him to declare war on the Greeks. I pretended to ally with Mao but really I only wanted Mao to invade Greece because I knew the Greeks growth would slow, I secretly however knew Mao would lose albeit it would take at least a hundred years. In 2050 the game ended with India its victors

more map and leader options
great graphics and details

I cant find a way to prebuild a custom map
worldbuilder after game starts make cheating too easy and tempting

So, the main differences from Civ 3 I can see are these: it's got a lot more different types of resources; the tech tree has been tweaked and had a few more items added in; there are more Wonders and types of Wonder; there's the whole new ""religions"" stream of progress options (very Pokemon, in a way - collect them all!);  there's better animation of your units (and you can see your unit as a group, rather than a single individual); civic rules are a lot more customisable across a variety of dimensions (political, economic, social, religious); and you've lost the ability to tweak your palace or view your city close-up.  Oh, and the game can be customised to a much greater degree than before.

It still has a lot of the same basic assumptions (and thus a lot of the same basic pitfalls) as the earlier games in the series.  A victory via conquest or other aggressive means is always going to out-score a victory by cultural hegemony or other such peaceful means.  The view of ""progress"" is still very linear, and there's very much a perspective of ""the only way is up"" (now, admittedly, I haven't really got to the modern era all that often, so I don't know whether there's still the pollution and global warming hazards to be aware of - I really should read the manual to be sure).  The world leaders you're playing are very much biased toward European and Western cultures (there's China, Japan and India representing Asia; Mali and Egypt representing Africa; and the Incas representing South America; meanwhile there's the USA, England, Spain, France, Germany, Russia, Greece, Rome and Persia representing Europe and the global West), so the whole issue of over-emphasis on technologies found useful in the global ""West"" is a thing.  However, as I said, these are standard problems (of the ""this thing I like is somewhat problematic"" variety) with the entire series - it's very much a case of either they're deal-breakers for you  as a player, or you accept the game for what it is, and make a mental note of the problematic bits to think about later.

Gameplay-wise, it's much the same as all the other iterations of the series: you move any pieces you have available to move, and press enter to signal the end of your turn.  If you don't have any pieces to move, the game will sit there prompting you to press ""enter"" until the skies fall (my biggest gameplay annoyance, quite honestly), but then, this [i]is[/i] a turn-based game, and that's what you're in for as a result of playing it.  (Oh, and if you didn't already have every single turn-based game known to humanity sitting in your Steam preview queue before you started playing, you will shortly afterwards... or maybe that's just me).

I can't comment on the multi-player aspect of the game, because I don't play multi-player (I play games to relax, not to stress myself out by getting pounded into the dirt).  The music is very pleasant (and very repetitive) and you're able to turn it down or off as this suits you.  

Given I play this game to relax, and I'm not really into high scores or anything like that, I'm probably not the best person to review it.  But overall, I'm finding Civ 4 to be an interesting upgrade from Civ 3, and I'm really liking finding out how to handle all the new bits and pieces in the game.",1454051499,1454051499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Big fan of the Civ titles, some more than others. Played Civ III for the majority of my childhood on a regular basis, Great game, crazy learning curve

Then, picked up Civ V on a wim and was actually rather disapointed. not a BAD game, but not on par with the early'r instalments. To simple, by comparison. (Dumbed down for the casual gamer I guess?)

When i stumbled on civ IV on sale I desided to take a risk on it. Best choice of my adult life. Though I haven't had the time to really sink my teeth into it hours wise. the gameplay is so solid I knew I had been shorting my self for all these years. Has much of the complexity of the third title but slightly less intimedating, plus, losts of features that should have been in the games from the get go, such as a state religion. 

10/10 for turn based perfection

This is arguably the best 4x game ever made; I don't think I am alone in this opinion.   What make it so is a combination of things, not just individual features.   The variety of strategies, the diplomacy, the range of units possible, the difference in the character of the Civs, I don't know I could go on and on and I think there are people who can say it better.

There are two points I do want to make in passing, however.   First, Civ IV was an evolution of Civ 1, 2, and 3.   Some people criticize it because it is an evolution, not a revolutionary new take on 4x.    Personally, I think taking all the good stuff and making it better and adding little stuff that made the whole pie a beautiful thing to experience is a very, very good thing.    Second, Civ IV Vanilla was a very good game, but not a world beater.   The addition of Warlords and especially Beyond the Sword is what made it great.    Of course there are a  lot of mods out there if you want, but the fact is that the only mod I think you might want to get a great gaming experience is the Bug Mod, which doesn't change the game play at all but adds a lot of helpful tools.

10/10  Best Ever.

So my in-laws bought me Civilization III, which was really fun. I then saw that Civilization IV was on sale, along with the expansions, so I bought the main game and a couple of the expansions. I am currently enjoying the happily ever after.
This is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. My husband and I are enjoying a hotseat match in which I am sure will end in a bloodbath. In Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword I am preparing to conquer the world with my mighty Celtic army. Civilization IV is an awesome strategy game in which almost anything is possible. There are so many different leaders to choose, and many different ways to beat the game. Sure, you could do a military victory, but you can also win diplomatically, artistically, and financially. There is also the Space Race...
For those of you kind of wary of strategy titles, let me assure you this is a very newbie friendly game. There are a variety of difficulties, and very detailed tutorials to help out. Also, being turn based has a huge advantage in being able to think out what you want to do. Having played Paradox Interactive titles like Victoria II, this is a far cry from the level of complexity found in those games. Nor is it very concerned with historical authenticity. When I first played as Boudicca, a warrior queen of the Celts, I expected to run into one of the Caesars, but instead I ran into General Bismark! My husband demonstrated some interesting divergents from history by having his Germans found Judaism 8), Christianity, and Islam. By what should have been mid-early Dark Ages, his musketmen were busy conquering the Russian Civilization. By the Industrial Revolution, his assorted tanks were conquering the world. He then won peacefully by using the UN to vote himself as the ruler of the world. Yeah...you definitely couldn't do that in a Paradox Interactive title.

So anyway, first of all there's a bunch of empires all with their own technologies, pros, cons and so on. And for each empire you get at least one leader. Each empire comes with a unique unit which can alter gameplay, such as the English redcoat, the French musketeer or the German Panzer Tank.

That brings me to the next great part - the units in the game. You start off with one city, and from there you can choose to make/train anything you have the technologies and resources to make/train. For example, you can train a warrior to fight, a scout to explore the map, a settler to find a new city, and later in the game (literally almost at the end), if you have the right stuff, you can make nukes!

The real icing on the cake is the fact that it is all so - well, real. You make contact with a new country, you make peace with them, you trade with them, you give them stuff - and then they can turn on you. Honestly Germany, why did you? You beat me, and I had grenadiers, war elephants and artillery; all you had were a few archers and a single catapult!

And last but not least, there's the winning. You can win by lots of ways: getting the most points by 2050, getting to Alpha Centauri first (space victory), controlling at least half the world, killing all other civilizations etc. All this great stuff turns the game into a real life simulation that is addictive and super fun. 10/10",1402519013,1409166977,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

Each new version is an improvement on an already good original, adding new refinements and fresh idea's to enhance the game play.  The diplomatic options have come on in leaps and bounds, eliminating one of the few flaws in the first version.  The variety of ways the game can be won, and the option to have a new map every time, ensures each game is different to the last.  The number of Nations that can be played is excellent, and each Nation and it's leaders bring their own skills to the table.  As a result, you can persue a victory based on your Nation's strengths if you wish, or just unleash your Army regardless and go for the hard kill.  A number of difficulty levels change the challenge to match your experience, and the huge customization available gives you the chance to make things as you wish for a specific play.  As an example, if you want a huge Navy select a world type based on islands with a world surface heavy on the water, select a Nation with a nautical skill or Special Unit and get it on.
