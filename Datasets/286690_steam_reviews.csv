There were some aspects to this game that I liked, but at every turn there's a poorly explained mechanic, odd level design, inconsistent stealth, a story that's poorly told, and an ending chapter that decides to take every awful gaming cliche and throw it in the blender. The setting is really interesting and I would have liked more freedom in exploring it, but this is a very linear shooter. Some people compare this to Fallout, but they have nothing in common other than the post apocalyptic setting. This isn't an open world rpg full of exploration, this is a nearly on rails shooter with occasional areas that open up a bit allowing you to get through either with combat, stealth, or a combo of both. It also has two endings, but since one is official and carries over into the next game I see no reason for even including the other. It's possible I'm reviewing this too much through the eyes of 2024 and not when it came out, but things like graphics and sound were fine for me. I don't think I would have liked a lot of the gameplay elements had I played it day one. I know my review won't have any effect on this game or it's legacy, but it just does too many things wrong for me to give it a thumbs up. It would be a thumbs sideways if that were an option, but sadly it still isn't so even though it might be a 49 to 51 split, I still have to downvote this.

I picked up Metro Exodus, the most recent game in the series at the time of writing this, at some unknown point, and with no games I really wanted to play, I checked it out. Right away, this game is very much not my usual kind of game: I like high fantasy, RPG, etc. Other nerdy shit. But after playing Exodus for some time, I came to see a lot of the same bones of a traditional fantasy RPG with a Russian coat of paint and it was... endearing. Curious about the intro that says, ""based on the book"", I got curious and found out there was other games in the franchise and it was, in fact a series. Stopping my playthrough dead in my tracks on Exodus, I saw that Metro 2033 Redux was not only on sale for $1.99 (fucking WHAT??) but the whole series was on sale. Deciding there was no harm, I purchased 2033, Last Light and all the DLC that comes with them. Now I wasn't expecting anything from Metro 2033. It was the first in the series and clearly this was the remastered version and it shows. So much of this game is polished up from the original, but to spare you the read, Metro 2033 Redux had an amazing world with engaging characters. It felt lived in, and borderline believable. I fell in love with the characters, and even the way it told a Man vs. Nature story that I rarely seem to find in videogames. The combat is a little silly sometimes, but with all the loot, guns, customization and secrets, you very quickly stop caring. 

Aside from the combat being kind of silly sometimes, there is a certain jankiness to the stealth that seems to be present across the Metro series. Its not bad, necessarily, but it is really forgiving and a lot of times it makes me laugh. Personally, I would also have difficulty sometimes shooting targets with weapons like the Helsing despite them being directly in my crosshairs, I'd miss completely, and that would end up getting me absolutely deleted. As I said, the game's definitely not perfect, but a lot of times the story makes up for it in spades. You can argue that there's a lot of Hollywood style coincidences where shit goes so off the rails (sometimes literally) but works out that detract from the overall value of the individual event sequences, but there's a certain point where you have to just let go and have some fun with it.

I don't normally say this, but I give this game a very solid 8.5/10. If the combat could be a little tighter, and some small things could be changed, it might even be a perfect 10.

All that said, I am achievement hunting the game atm, and replaying it shows me a lot of stuff I missed in the story on my first run. This game has layers, like an ogre, and I'm eager to finally unravel what this world has, and eagerly await the next installment in the Metro series here in 2024. 

[Side note, I also began reading the book which I HIGHLY recommend despite not being much of a book guy. It's very engrossing and helps build onto the world depicted in the game.]

Doesn't deserve overwhelmingly good reviews. The backdrop and atmosphere of the (original) game made it a cult-classic. Cult-classics can often get away with bad writing because their backstories appeal to people. Or maybe people just have low standards. Or maybe they are mentally incapable of identifying bad writing.

Once I learned about them...I still didn't use them lol.

I think this game is pretty easy despite me playing on survivor mode (less ammo and stuff compared to spartan), so don't worry about the ammo warning or anything, I didn't buy anything, not even gas filters, I even found all the guns I liked. That being said the game has a pretty good stealth system and even if you get caught, every guy you take out stealth is net positive on ammo.

Recomendado. 

A primeira run foi survival + ranger hardcore e dificultou bastante o início do jogo, a falta de UI e dicas inicialmente fez falta, como o uso do recharger pra lanterna e night vision por exemplo. Mas assim que você entende a pegada do jogo tudo flui muito bem. Os gráficos são exatamente o que você espera e com certeza vai surpreender em algumas cenas mais ""especiais"".

This was disappointing, especially for the ak47 which had a nice punchy and heavy sound in the original.

A good thing I noticed is that the frame rate is more stable than the first game, but I was running it at 1920x1440, so probably that's why.

If sneaking and/or killing your way through a post-apocalyptic hellscape to save your settlement from an existential threat sounds fun, you will likely enjoy this game more than enough to justify its purchase, even if it isn't anything new.

Take this review with a grain of salt, as I don't often play FPS games. When I do, I tend to stick to narrative driven single-player experiences like the Half-Life or Bioshock franchises. Compared to those titles, Metro 2033 feels pretty reserved in its scope and environments, but they have done a laudable job in creating a universe that feels lived in and appropriately oppressive.

Based on a Russian novel, the story starts 20 years on from a war that has destroyed life as we know it, the people of Moscow live in the titular metro system, having formed small city-states at different stations. The population is tiny, and they get by mainly through scavenging the ruins of the old world, with the surface now covered by toxic atmosphere, intense radiation, and dangerous mutated creatures. A new threat has emerged on the northern boundaries of this society, and is wiping out defenders with attacks that leave them mentally devastated. You play as Artyom, a young man who is seemingly immune to these attacks, as he sets out on a journey to rally the defenders of the metro system to strike at this new threat.

The story is fine; it's nothing wildly new or unique, but the environment feels like the real main character. In your trek you'll have to cross miles of untamed tunnels, break the frontlines of a war raging between nazis and communists, and brave the surface to achieve your goals. The maps feel appropriately cramped, but big enough to leave room for exploration, and the threats feel real without relying on too many jumpscares.

As far as the gameplay goes, Metro isn't really doing anything revolutionary. Most missions will see you killing plenty of enemies, with optional stealth mechanics that never felt unfair or frustrating. You can carry up to three weapons at a time, and there are a decent number to choose from. None of them felt terribly novel, though I did like the air pressure-powered ball bearing weapons that you have to periodically pump to maintain sufficient stopping power. It feels like they intended for the game to have survival horror ammo management challenges, but even playing on the Survival mode I never felt starved for ammunition. I played on Normal difficulty, so maybe on harder settings you'll find yourself having to switch up ammo types due to scarcity, but I felt like they were a little too generous with it.

My only real complaint with this game is with its ending and moral system. The problem is that which ending you get depends on actions you've taken during the course of the game. That sounds fine, but this system is never explained, and the ""good"" actions can be arbitrary. Want the ""good"" ending? You'd better stop what you're doing to listen to certain background NPC conversations and make sure to loot specific stashes. Basically, if you don't follow a guide the entire game you're almost guaranteed to get the ""bad"" ending, without even really knowing that you could have changed it. On top of that, having played the sequel (Last Light) I know that your choice doesn't ultimately impact the world, as that story assumes one specific ending and moves on. If the player doesn't have any meaningful agency, why add the illusion of it, then hide that behind an unexplained system.

Overall, this is a pretty run-of-the-mill narrative shooter with a fine story, fantastic atmosphere, and a poorly-executed morality system that you should probably ignore on your first playthrough if you don't want to ruin the experience. Just plan for a hand-holding second run if you want to see the less gloomy ending.",1707845529,1707845529,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As Artyom, I found myself immersed in a world filled with danger, mystery, and heart-pounding action. Late nights and early mornings were spent exploring the depths of the Metro, uncovering its secrets and facing off against terrifying mutants and hostile factions.

What struck me most about the game was its attention to detail. From the eerie ambiance of the tunnels to the haunting beauty of the ruined surface, every location felt alive with history and atmosphere. I often found myself pausing just to admire the scenery, marveling at the intricate design and imagining the stories behind each crumbling building and darkened alleyway.

The stealth and survival mechanics kept me on the edge of my seat throughout my playthrough. Whether I was sneaking past patrolling enemies or engaging in intense firefights, every encounter felt tense and exhilarating. I spent countless hours strategizing my approach, carefully managing my resources, and adapting to the ever-changing threats lurking in the shadows.

But ""Metro 2033"" is more than just a thrilling shooter. It's a deep and thought-provoking journey into the human condition. Through Artyom's interactions with fellow survivors and the haunting remnants of a once-great civilization, I was forced to confront difficult moral choices and existential questions. These moments of reflection lingered with me long after I had put down the controller, adding an extra layer of depth to an already compelling narrative.

And let's not forget the game's stunning visuals and immersive sound design. The eerie echoes of distant screams and the flickering glow of my gas mask's flashlight added to the game's atmosphere, drawing me further into its dark and desolate world.

Finnaly, I've spend wonderful late night and early mornings throughwith Metro, i enjoyed, definetly you must try this game, i bought it in 2019 and just now i found the time and the interes to play it, so now im moving to next part which will be Last Light.

The gameplay is repetitive, the story is kind of a mess, I got so frustrated that I actually debated abandoning the game multiple times, and the game would glitch out sometimes and not save properly (adding to my frustration). Despite all this, I found the game oddly addicting. When I wasn't playing I'd often find myself thinking about what would happen next (I went in blind with no spoilers) or how I could get through the section I was stuck at. The gunplay feels great and the stealth is fun to mess with and exploit, but I didn't really get into the story outside of the basics sadly.

There was a scripted moment where you have to run through a place while getting shot, I kept dying here cause I didn't know where the f*** I had to go... it's full of scripted bs moments like this; everytime a so called demon catches you, you get hanged in a quick time event... The ending is a bit Half-Lifey, and the game doesn't give three damns about explaining it to you, so good luck trying to figure out the story.

I'd go into this one with a degree of hesitation because although the gunplay is fine and theres plenty of accessibility with difficulty/game modes etc, some of the missions are just downright annoying and not fun to play. Game won me over again towards the end but there was a lull in the middle where I just wanted it to be over. 

voice acting ranges from OK to laughable, story is really interesting and [spoiler] you feel like the game only scratches the surface of whats going on (in a good way), you get the impression that your character doesn't have to understand the full picture, only the details relevant to the circumstances hes in. Long story short it doesn't over-explain too much with the lore, which I appreciated. [/spoiler]

definitely worth picking up in the sales but don't expect it to be a jolly old time dancing through the apocalyptic landscapes, there'll be some tough times to get through soldier. 

Enjoy and, side note (something cool) you can convert a .38 revolver into a carbine rifle. That's gotta count for something right!?

The remastering of this game has definitely done its job, since i enjoyed it quite a lot, and it is much more polished than the original in all the good ways, this is the best way to play the game. This game had an amazing atmosphere, pretty acceptable graphics for a remastered old game, but stunning visuals. the story is pretty good as well as well as some engaging gameplay.

The redux edition is quite definitely the best way to play this, with obviously better graphical fidelity, better balancing option, better AI, and more gameplay elements than the original. This is how remasters should be done.

The extremely eerie post-apocalyptic atmosphere and feeling of this game is quite unmatched. it is so immersive in almost all situations, be it scary and dark underground tunnels, eerie, void of life above ground destroyed cities.

The graphical fidelity is much better than the original for sure, but don't expect next-gen models and textures, it can still look like an old game.
But this excused with the stunning visuals of the environment art and the lighting that goes with it.

The story is a nice one and complements the game greatly, there are many characters you meet along the way and most are pretty like-able.

The gameplay is pretty great, especially when you are against other humans, because sneaking around an enemy outpost, trying to sneakily take them out, and then if you get seen you go guns blazing, but still have to worry about limited ammo, is very fun, and it makes you feel like a professional special ops.

Character starts off in one place, trots through dozens of other places and ends up at a tower........oh and fights monster type things along the way. The interactions with the npc's were poor at best, I had no feeling of involvement with anyone.
The monster things were never explained ( as in could they even be killed?), and while I found lots of ammo at times, it constantly ran out due to the numerical superiority of the opposition - and that included bandits and so on.
Not to put spoilers out there - for noobs like myself - there's a ride in a railcart where you man the turret - worst controls ever and an overheating gun.
Terrible save system.

To start with, the game throws you right in the middle of a big fight where you end up being pinned down by monsters. I was really confused about what was going on. Then the actual story starts. You are Artyom, a man who wants to save his home from a new emerging threat that appeared on the surface of the Earth, the Dark Ones, after mutants have taken over. You are guiding him throughout the story, uncovering the secrets of the deadly and atmospheric post-apocalyptic world. Personally, I found the story interesting enough for me to finish the game in 3 sittings. 

Performance-wise, being an older game, I expected it to run well on my relatively decent PC (Ryzen 7 5700G, RTX 4060, 32GB RAM), so I cranked all the settings to max. To my surprise, I was getting around 50 - 60 FPS most of the time (even going down to the 30s) and my GPU usage was pinned to 100%. I did find the culprit though, SSAA, more about it [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/286690/discussions/0/34096318957879276/] here [/url].

As far as gameplay is concerned, gunplay feels good enough especially when you get to modify your weapons or find already modified weapons after defeating enemies as loot or scattered around.  The game seems to prioritize being stealthy, even recommending it in the tips, though I really suck at stealth games so I just ended up using firepower to get through the levels that involved stealth.  This proved to be a bit of a problem since some of the enemies seem to be bullet sponges so I had to make use of a lot of ammo and grenades.

Level design-wise, I sometimes found it confusing. The game gives you a compass that shows you where to go but even with that, I got lost here and there when I was following the direction that it was showing me. I did find the compass mechanic interesting but also a bit annoying since it shares the same button as the button to use the lighter, M. Also, there is a journal paper on the compass, where Artyom writes down your current objective. You can see it if you have the compass out and press the right-click.

There is also a mechanic that isn't really explained, how to charge your flashlight and night-vision battery. Hold F and the charger pops up. Press the right-click multiple times until it is fully charged (it was probably explained in the original Metro 2033 game and it assumes you already played it, I suppose).

I would like to note that I played the game on normal difficulty and the Survival Mode (which is more akin to the original Metro 2033 game). 

As a closing note, overall, I enjoyed the game. It really scratched the itch I had for the 2010s singleplayer shooters. The atmosphere was well done, even making me get jumpscared here and there by some attacking enemies. It also make me feel the fear of the unknown.

I think the current price of about £1 is fair, but the usual price of almost £18 us laughable.

This is like buying a """"""fun"""""" zised chocolate bar. I want the whole thing, man. The missions were fairly easy, and I felt handheld through the story with very railroad-y cutscenes. I wasn't super impressed with the gameplay balence and v easy difficulty, but matched with a runtime that doesn't even crack double digits, I don't see this having much replayability outside of trophy hunting for the sake of it. The gameplay felt second to the story, that wasn't super well developed. Maybe I've just overdosed on generic dystopias with mutants?

Spoiler territory: How would nuking the surface even help? We've seen that the tunnels are absolutely infested with mutant life, so if we are to believe that nuking the surface should kill them all, shouldn't that kill all the metro dwellers too? The whole time I was under the impression we were saving one station, but at the end, they act like the world has been saved.

I was frightened. Playing on the highest difficulty made me so paranoid and actually fearful and invested. I'm always looking around me to see if anyone is going to suddenly ambush me. The Slavic setting and humor are perfect, and the voice acting makes all the characters memorable forever. There is definitely a cult for this franchise for a long time. 

What I appreciate the most is its simple but meaningful take on linear gameplay. There was no need to overcomplicate it with extra filler or open-world boundaries. The gunplay is excellent, too.

The environments all are really well crafted to bring this across. 

And the other key ingredient that helps it come off so well is the characters, they’re all charmingly human in terms of their writing and behavior, and while Artyom himself is silent, his short banters during loading screens do give him enough character to be invested in his journey. That being said, the story is more about the place than the people, it’s a really good example of having well defined characters helping worldbuilding tremendously. I will say tho: Fuck. The. Turret. Section. That is the one blemish in an otherwise really well-paced and slower campaign. 

In terms of the gameplay itself, it also does put emphasis on the survival aspect, as it does limit ammo for your weapons and the enemies, while not tough, do tend to swarm you and overwhelm you and make you waste what little ammo you have; which is why stealth is highly encouraged, and honestly, stealth in this game isn’t as pace breaking as it would be in other games because all-out combat isn’t that bombastic or crazy to begin with, and it does fit with Artyom's character of being just some random guy who’s only getting a taste of the world beyond his home, going up against entire armies.

Combined with the old early 2000's graphics makes this game a nostalgic masterpiece. The story this game tells is serious enough to keep me engaged with all its characters and beautiful environment, even if its a dark metro tunnel. Each setting is filled with a interactive environment with plenty of little details when looking at level design. For a small shooter game, I absolutely love the clunky combat and weapon mechanics. For the gun play itself, its really enjoyable in my opinion. Upgrading and scavenging for guns and ammo is really enjoyable if that's the type of game play you're into. The game allows various play styles like Stealth and Loud approaches, stealth first then going loud or vise versa. Either way both are enjoyable options, metro also implements a ""karma"" system to its game play. So if you want a good ending you'll need to explore the world and play a certain way. All and all Its a very good game and it holds up very well on my low end PC. When I purchased the game I bought it in a 4.99 bundle with Metro 2033 redux and Metro Last light redux, knowing what I know now Id genuinely would buy this game for a tripple A title release price of 60 USD.

This is the first game of the Metro saga based off the books with (in this case) the same name and i simply cant explain how much i loved this game and all of the games that came after this.

oh god what a surprise of a game.

From some of the people who made the stalker games we got this game with settled on a post apocaliptic moscow in the year 2033 where the world has been destroyed due to WW 3, as a consequence of this now the world is filled with monsters and the surface is so toxic and radioactive that the people had to go underground and make their lifes in the moscow metro system.

The first thing I want to talk about its his atmosphere which oh god how I loved it, every level tells you more about the world just by how it is done, the dirty and filthy metro tunnels where monster crawl and can attack you anytime, always told to maintain your guard up cuz you never know when you're going to get attacked by one of the monsters that walk around those same tunnels. How in every station you visit you can see the state people have to live and survive in, how in many occasions throughout the games we celebrate with our friends after surviving a trip through those tunnels and the surface cuz the fact that we're alive after facing those hazards is a real miracle..

[Spoilers] And moments like the mission where the kid we're rescuing is amazed by the sky, something he has never seen and talks about how he is going to tells his friends about it.

[Not more spoilers] The game is crafted in a way that you can inmerse yourself into his world in such an easy way that you're gonna find yourself cheering everytime you come alive of a trip in the surface, smilign with your commrades everytime you come out alive with them, feeling the death of some of them and feeling your heart beat faster everytime you're in a situation close to death. Fr the game is really helpfull with the autosaves, saving everytime you enter a new zone but still you dont feel fear cuz you're gonna have to go back and do everything again, you're gonna feel pain cuz you're going to be so inmerse that you're gonna do anything to survive like if that was the only life you had..

Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn`t have to much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stalker there among them had a Helsing on his hip
Helsing on his hip

It might`ve been early in the morning, when he rode in through the tram
He came ridin from the North line, slowly looking all around
He deserted from the frontlines, came the whisper from each lip
And he`s here to see Miller with a message from his kin
Message from his kin

In the Metro ran a rumor of a massive mutant threat,
Many men had tried to take them, and that meny men were dead
20 men had left the station, not one survived the trip
21 would be the stalker with the Helsing on his hip
Helsing on his hip

Now the stalker started talking, made it plain to folks around
Was an Exhibition dweller, wouldn`t be too long around
He came here to find the Rangers, with or without any help
And he said it didn`t matter, for his homeland was in threat
His homeland was in threat

Wasn`t long before the message was relayed to Ranger Miller,
So he called up a meeting, for the matter was urgent
They knew what was coming and the North needed some help
But the council simply denied his petition in a swift
Faster than a swift

Miller called up the stalker, told him he had a plan
It was 20 past 11 when he walked out to the streets
They fitted their gasmasks well, so as to not hold their breath
They knew they couldn`t fail, or Polis would meet its end
Polis would meet its end

They were merely 40 feet in when the Watchmen made their play
But the swiftness of the Rangers is stilled talked about today
They were headed for the Library, not a mutie would stop them
And the stalker`s aim was deadly with the Helsing on his hip
Helsing on his hip

It was over in a moment and the Rangers gathered round
There before them lay the Library, with not a soul around

The game takes you on a journey through the dark and dangerous tunnels of the Moscow Metro, where you face mutant creatures, hostile factions, and paranormal phenomena. You play as Artyom, a young man who holds the key to humanity's salvation, and must fight your way to the heart of the Metro to deliver a message that could change the fate of the world.

The game features two modes of gameplay: Survival and Spartan. Survival mode is closer to the original Metro 2033, with scarce resources, limited ammo, and slower pacing. Spartan mode is more action-oriented, with more ammo, faster combat, and streamlined stealth. You can also choose between two difficulty levels: Normal and Hardcore. Hardcore mode removes the HUD, crosshair, and quick-time events, making the game more challenging and realistic.

The game's graphics are stunning, with improved lighting, shadows, textures, and animations. The game runs smoothly on the PS4, Xbox One, and PC, with no noticeable glitches or bugs. The sound design is also impressive, with realistic gunshots, explosions, and environmental noises. The voice acting is decent, although some of the accents are a bit exaggerated. The music is atmospheric and fitting, with a mix of orchestral and electronic tracks.

Gameplay: It has a very interesting story and a very intriguing way of explaining it, as the mechanics of the game are repeated a bit. It has a variety of weapons and very good quality in details and characters. It has serious, mysterious, comic and dark characters. Including very aggressive enemies which make the game more exciting. The game includes two Combat/Item difficulties which have quite striking challenges.

Achievements: Includes 49 campaign/weapon/map achievements, including the two endings.

Soundtracks: Incredible, quite moving and of good quality, the one I liked the most is when we meet Khan which is called ""Ghost Tunnels"".

Maps: The scenarios are incredible and very large to collect objects and strategize how to eliminate enemies.

DLC: Does not include downloadable content but it would be nice if it had content at least from the game's soundtracks.

NOTE: Before purchasing this product on Steam, I tested the XBOX One version and I have to say that the PC version has problems with some animations that would be good to review for computer platforms.

[list]
[*]The visuals give a great sense of atmosphere, every area in the game feels real which is really immersive imho. All the buildings, metro stations, outfits, makeshift weapons etc. are cohesive and form a consistent world that's enjoyable to play in
[*]The story is very good with lots of interesting points that drive the player forward wanting to find out more and more. Some of them are resolved, some are left for your own interpretation, which in here is done well imho. I wish the nature of the Dark Ones was better explained to give a player a better understanding of the true story and the endings
[*]Interesting characters with good dialogues. A lot of them are memorable with their unique behaviors and style
[*]Great world building, I think it shows a very real side of human nature when forced into these circumstances
[*]The gunplay feels satisfying, most guns are responsive and punchy with good sounds and nice animations
[*]Really cool stealth system. Too bad the game doesn't even mention it's a feature
[*]You have the option to play with or without HUD which is neat if you're looking for a more immersive gameplay. Even the prompts can be disabled
[*]Interesting trading system with valuable bullets as currency which can also be used for extra damage during gameplay
[*]Most weapons have mags you can partially see through to check how many bullets you have left, and optionally what ammo type is currently loaded in. And I really like the rest of the interface essentially being integrated as ingame items rather than HUD elements
[/list]

[h1]Mixed[/h1]
[list]
[*]Some weapons have pretty janky reload animations
[*]Quite a few weapons feels really clunky to use and powerless against enemies. Pneumatic weapons for example feel underpowered compared to everything else. Not only I have to maintain the pressure manually (which is just a hassle), but they feel straight up worse than other weapons
[*]Speech during loading screens is way too loud compared to the rest of the game
[*]There's a really weird fog effect when using NVGs, but only in the center of the screen? I don't get what's happening here because you have clear vision around the edges of the screen, this fog only blocks sight towards the center and beyond a certain ingame distance. It's kind of annoying. Even when the given area has no fog or dust at all, you'll still see this cloud in front of you blocking a major part of your vision if objects are far enough
[*]Your watch isn't visible at all when you're using the LMG shotgun
[*]I like the ammo trading system, but I think there aren't enough traders in total so you don't get to experience the full arsenal the game has to offer
[/list]

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[list]
[*]Silent protagonist. I don't like when NPCs talk to me and my character just says nothing, it's so dumb and awkward. Not to mention lots of situations could have been avoided if I could tell the group what I've seen, information I've heard, my thoughts etc.
[*]Terrible stuttering out of the box, it makes the game almost unplayable. The only fix I found was to disable [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Metro_2033_Redux#:~:text=fix%5B16%5D-,Micro%20Stuttering,-%E2%80%A2%20Link]CPU core parking[/url]
[*]Low default FOV which imho isn't enjoyable to play. You can easily fix it but that'll mess up some animations, and the FOV in the ending sequence will go to unplayable levels. You'll have to manually dial it back for that section of the game
[*]Really weird mouse sensitivity and different speeds for vertical and horizontal movements. It's an easy fix tho, check the above link. Visual effects overlaid on the screen also break with higher FOV than default
[*]The interactions tutorial is misleading. It requires you to 'press and hold' on the very first one, but the rest of the game is just the regular 'press once' and done. This makes no sense and it's unintuitive
[*]Mutants sometimes don't die properly and continue their animation and sounds without doing any damage beyond that point. This can be funny or really annoying depending on the map
[*]When you fall into water there's a strange animation of you just floating there for a few seconds before the game teleports you out to the nearest ledge and gives you back control. It's really awkward and lasts way too long
[*]The karma system to get the good ending can be tedious and boring after the first playthrough
[*]Sprinting feels clunky, and after some interactions you can't start running instantly which can get you killed
[*]Some mutants are overtuned imho; they seem to take way too many shots to kill and/or deal too much damage to the player
[*]Fighting non-human enemies isn't fun because of the clunky running, enemy attack +movement speeds and unclear damage feedback. Lurkers are a great example of this. They're way more annoying than enjoyable
[*]The game sometimes throws an unreasonable amount of enemies at you at once which isn't fun in the slightest, especially when taking the other points into account
[*]In some weapons you can't tell how many bullets are left in the mag and what ammo type is loaded
[*]Most scopes are barely upgrades over iron sights. The red dot-style sight is probably the best, as the magnified scopes don't make it ovbious where you're aiming. The center of the reticle blends into the scope's texture and the background almost all the time

I have right now like a million games to play - and movies to see, and series to watch, and books to read, plus a job to sustain all of such luxuries. I haven't even played its sequels already. Time is of essence... and yet this is a game that, for its moments of clumsiness, fascinated me enough to make me play it three times. So what's up about it that made me so enamoured to it?

The gameplay would be a start. Being a single-player FPS, ""2033"" lays emphasis in PvE, and the different things players have to do in order to make it through the levels. There are so many commands at play here, so many things to memorise, that it can get a bit frustrating at first. In certain environments, you need to put on a gas-mask, and you have to remember to always clean it up when it starts getting grimy and dirty; it also starts cracking up when you take damage. You can see how much time you have left of air, and you have to change the filter after enough time. There's the basic flashlight, and then there's a lighter to burn through spiderwebs; there's also night vision. The C key is for throwable items, such as explosives and knifes, while the V key is for meele. If you hold R, you can change the ammo type, or ""recharge"" your weapon, depending of what kind of weapon you're holding. And don't forget your medkits!

All of this may feel unnecessarily bloated, as if the developers had all these cool ideas and wanted to implement them all. But I cannot help but to admire how many commands I had: it really made me fell like I'm a survivor, packing several essential things to survive. And smarter players may use all the tools at their disposal.

Despite being based on the book by Dmitry Glukhovsky (gotta love games based on books), it's clear ""2033"" was really meant as a spiritual successor to the ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R."" games, with its gloomy, post-apocalyptic Eastern European setting. The main difference is that while ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R."" took place in large open world environments, ""2033"" is mostly set in the dark undergrounds of Moscow. And taking place at tunnels means this game is fairly linear.

I don't know if I would classify it as a semi-open world, like ""Dead Rising"" or ""Dark Souls"". But scenarios are large, multi-layered and interconnected enough to hold logs (because it's video game law), dead bodies with ammo, and keys for safes. The curious thing is that sometimes you may find a key but not the safe, and vise-versa: where there is one, there is always the other. Despite the linearity, environments grew so large that I got lost on them, as the path forwards is not always very clear: it's not a very visually vibrant game, and paths of interest may blend in with environments. It was then that I discovered an ""Alien: Isolation""-like compass that could guide me to the right path - yet another command. 

Of course there are levels on the outside, showing the decrepit, snowy, ""12 Monkeys""-like streets of Moscow, but even those levels are mostly linear. In fact, the game is not really about solving puzzles, scouting people or any other things. It's about going from point A to point B, while facing enemies standing against your progress; sometimes with mates, sometimes on your own. There are some situations in which you have to hold your ground, and a moment when you carry a rather talkative boy to safety and movement becomes limited. But the game overall plays like this, and I guess this simplicity about it is a triumph. There are also levels with no combat at all, taking place at populated areas, where you can buy and upgrade weapons and talk to other dwellers.

Then, there's the combat. As I said, there are a bazillion commands to do, which means there are different ways of killing your enemies. Some levels were designed to support stealth and the usage of quiet weapons. You can go guns blazing if that's your thing, but the issue however is that ""2033"" was really designed as a survivor game: this is not ""Call of Duty"". To go guns blazing can be incredibly stressful, and it doesn't help that your character is not very mobile: in fact, he's rather quite slow, having this walking sound that I can only describe as ""rusty"".

On easy mode, the combat becomes much more pleasant and forgiving, and the game becomes less demanding, more conventional. You can focus on collecting things and better exploring the environments: some paths can lead to behind or above enemies, giving you an advantage. At some moments, you may find fuse boxes and turn the lights off, leaving your enemies in the dark.

Combat is much better when it's against humans, since creatures just jump at you in packs, and you're not the most mobile character. Particularly hateful is a flying monster that grabs you like the Wall Master, flies with you around, and then tosses you to the ground: it makes outside exploration even more annoying. There are also some moments when you have to operate machines and turrets, and I wish they were better developed, since they're not as fun as I hoped them to be.

Guns can be redesigned to your preference, but you can only carry three, and there'll be moments when you may come across interesting guns that will make you leave one of yours behind. The shotgun chain gun is one of the most satisfying shotguns I have ever seen in a video game, but it only shows at the final stretch. There are pneumatic weapons and electric charged ones, which you have to circumstantially recharge as I mentioned earlier. And then there are your traditional rifles, that can be loaded with a special kind of ammo. This brings me to one of the most interesting aspects of the game: the currency. At gun shops, you use this special incendiary ammo to buy and sell stuff. Not only it makes perfect sense in the context of the game - as this ammo is valuable in this world - it can also lead you to tough decisions when your normal ammunition runs out. Will you literally toss money away?

Following in the footsteps of ""BioShock"", the game presents players with a good and a bad ending, and to reach them, there are many choice moments through the game. The issue however is that these points are not best presented to players: at one moment, a comrade will casually tell you that you can hear children laugh if you put your head close to the pipes, so you have to stand next to the pipes long enough for you to hear laughter. Some points will be obvious enough, such as when you save the talkative boy and refuse payment. You're informed of the choices you made by a sound and a visual cue. It is very much a game that invites players to come back for collectibles, achievements, different play styles and alternative endings.

I've been playing this game simultaneously to ""The Last of Us, Part 1"", and it's curious to see how ""2033"" did all that the Naughty Dog classic did before it, and perhaps better. While its 2014 double-A graphics are no ""Crysis"" (some kids I came across felt like they had plastic hair), everything is full with detail, as the scenarios, models and art direction really sell this game: some tunnels feel claustrophobic, but the outside feels dangerous and inhospitable. At the two first times I played the game, I opted for Russian dialogues, to add to the immersion factor; now, I'm playing it in English, so I won't be so bothered with reading subtitles.

It is so clearly is a work of love from its developers, the Malta-based Ukranian 4A Games, which went through hell with this war and had to relocate its developers. By playing this game, I cannot help but to think about them, and what they've been put through.

Snowy wasteland is the coolest setting. The characters and story are drenched in charm amidst a post-apocalyptic, radiation, and mutant infested backdrop. Well worth a play if you're into a single player fps with a fantastic story set in a world devastated by a toxic wasteland. Don't let the dated look deter you, it's not that bad and the story plus the actual gameplay is worth it. Give the journal entries a read for insight into Artyom's thoughts and more about the world/himself/his friends and fellow rangers. These games are based on books and have a lot of quotable moments.

-If ya played Exodus first then ya won't enjoy this much, but have to thanks to this for the Exodus
-Graphics, characters are well done
-Plot, SFX, BGM, OST, VA are decent

-But however some CONS that lead me to a thumbs down
-Quick-time reaction events but not ""quick"", instead of put a big flashy text font on the screen to get players' attention, it's just show the same line as subtitle ""Quickly press E"", nothing else, no highlight, no flashy
-First weapon system is suck (Included the sound) the mighty .50 cal Dushka became a joke (also the DShK automatic-shotgun modified, look at the cartridge size bruhhh it's larger than normal 12 gauge) damage of weapons are unbalanced, SMGs on mutations just ammo-wasting, and sound is unrealistic
-Artyom's animations was slow and mutations' attack were fast (and they're bullet-sponge), human enemies detection were ridiculous
-Some bugs, some crashes, some screen freezes again
-Oh this one is personal tho, I don't like carry Sasha boi on the back, hearing voice next to my ears is creepy and extra weight
-Almost forgot, The Dark Ones, not so impressive, have to do much wayyy more than that to make me (and other players) reconsider not to yeet 3 missiles from afar and end all of it's kind.

An amazing graphics improvements! Lighting, atmosphere, models, textures! Fck me <3.
The main reason why I hated this game was that I was playing on the hardest possible difficulty and I have had made up myself in a fascist front line level dying a lot of times there. 
I mean the low gamma and no night vision mode (at the beggining ofc I know that u'll get it further) pissed me off a LOT! So I decided to tell the truth about atmosphere that this will gave u headache but not because it is too painful but from dying over and over again and hearing those fcking russian voices same fcking sentences jesus! 

So I have completed it and all I can tell u is that the game is almost perfect but what is not perfect is that there's no well made up characters. I mean there's no any relationships. Just a sad days of duty. They need to make a call, they need to go somewhere, they need to bring some goods for someone from someone etc.
So there's no amazing characters like Vass Montenegro from Far Cry 3 or Frank Woods from Cod Bo1.
I loved playing with shotgun fck me. The double barrel and the other with six shots one of the sexiest as not the sexiest one I have ever used in any game <3. 
Playing stealth and getting them by knife was awesome! I loved those executions. 
Enemy types monsters, humans were made up outstanding. But what I was seeing is that all u need to have is a good position and then u'll kill em all in stealth and in combat for sure. 
The whole graphics is one big fcking masterpiece and u can clearly compare it to crysis. The best ways to admire was on open space outdoor the building's. So fcking great trust me, believe me.
The whole story was made up to one goal destroy some ugly assholes by the end, but to be there to climb the final building and to clear up... not everything but some big space, u'll be suffering a lot!
And by the end of that review I'm suprised that I did enyoj the game and suprised that Im an idiot and didn't complete it before xD. U shall all have it and play it! But one big request from me, play it on spartan mode and on hard or if u must on stalker do not open it up on survival and stalker hard, JUST DO NOT ! Cuz u'll be like me instead of enyojing suffering a lot with total disaster and disbelieve to complete it. And u'll be gone at some point and have a big pain of headache. 

That's all a total banger and I can't wait to play the continue parts with my lovely shooty shotgun with my throwing knifes and like a boss Blazkowicz executions style! 
A very succesful life Im wishing you all happy Christmas cuz he was born today ! 
And remember the only disadvantage in this game is characters. They're just a soldiers like you. Don't mean much but matter much ! Ah u'll see :*

This is another one of those games people still recommend in the 2020's and refer to as the best yadida but to me the gameplay, characters and story are SO BORING every hour progressing through the monotonous different environments (I counted three: dirty tunnels, dirty city in ruins and dirty empty buildings that are sometimes offices and not offices) felt to me like a total waste of time. 

Now that would be totally OK the gunplay wasn't so bland and unimpactful. The gist of combat is to either use stealth when possible, trigger or wait for a monster standing-like-an-idiot behavior so you can get a headshot (just spend all your ammo, that's cool too). Repeatedly for 6 hours while listening to some NPC's boring you to death. 

In fact it's only scary because the autosaves force you to hear the same childish dialogue lines over and over at the beginning of each scripted peak difficulty events (there aren't that many). 

And last, you know how those games with slow narrative full of mystery make you wonder if the end will suck, answer zero questions or redeem the whole experience, but it's just wishful thinking? Well. Guess what.",1703405227,1703405650,False,2,1,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

You'll need to play the whole game at least twice to 100% it.  Luckily all the levels can be replayed individually so level-specific achievements aren't extremely annoying.  There's a hidden morality system in this game that affects your ending (which is also tied to achievements), so my recommendation would be to play the game once to experience it yourself and then use a guide to ensure you get the other ending on your following playthrough.",1703277096,1703277096,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I got it from the ""not-so-legal"" site and played the hell out of it, even though it was running in 20 frames per second. It's a great game with a great story and, for the time it released at, amazing graphics as well. The Redux improved a lot in the graphics and performance departament, but the change in lighting diminished that gritty, scary look the original game had.

Unfortunately, the game suffers from stuttering. I'm not sure, if it's something on my side, but it does stutter a lot, especially in combat. The hardware doesn't matter.",1548969684,1702906448,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You could prevent so much if he stopped taking 30s to get up every 5minutes.

Aside from that? I really enjoyed the gunplay of this game, Aside from Librarians two full assault rifle clips to take one down after my third librarian i was out of ammo and had to sprint the level.

The game's strength lies in its atmospheric storytelling. The post-apocalyptic world of Metro 2033 is hauntingly beautiful, with every dimly lit tunnel and desolate surface telling a story of survival and desperation. The attention to detail in the environments, coupled with the subtle narrative cues, creates a truly immersive experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The dark and claustrophobic metro tunnels, infested with mutated creatures, set the stage for intense and nerve-wracking encounters. The game masterfully blends survival horror elements with a compelling narrative, making each step forward a tense and unpredictable journey. The scarcity of resources adds another layer of challenge, forcing players to carefully manage their supplies and make tough decisions.

The character development and world-building in Metro 2033 Redux are exceptional. Artyom's journey is not just about survival; it's a voyage through a society struggling to exist in the aftermath of a devastating nuclear war. The diverse cast of characters you encounter adds depth to the narrative, making you genuinely care about their fates.

Graphics: ★★★★☆
Metro 2033 Redux features a significant visual overhaul, with improved textures, lighting effects, and character models. The atmospheric design of the Moscow Metro system is hauntingly immersive, capturing the bleakness and despair of a post-apocalyptic world. While not cutting-edge, the graphical enhancements contribute to the overall atmosphere.

Gameplay: ★★★★☆
The gameplay in Metro 2033 Redux combines first-person shooting with survival horror elements. The scarcity of resources, including ammunition and filters for your gas mask, creates a tense and immersive experience. The gunplay feels weighty, and the stealth mechanics add variety to encounters. However, some may find the controls slightly clunky compared to more modern shooters.

Story: ★★★★★
Based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novel, Metro 2033 Redux weaves a compelling narrative set in the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse. The story is rich in atmosphere, exploring themes of survival, morality, and the consequences of humanity's actions. The well-developed characters and the exploration of the dark tunnels of the Moscow Metro contribute to a narrative that is both captivating and thought-provoking.

Soundtrack: ★★★★★
The haunting and atmospheric soundtrack of Metro 2033 Redux enhances the game's immersive qualities. The ambient sounds of the metro, the echoes of distant screams, and the subtle musical cues all contribute to a chilling and memorable audio experience. The use of sound plays a crucial role in building tension and conveying the oppressive atmosphere of the game.

Level Design: ★★★★☆
The level design in Metro 2033 Redux is a mix of linear tunnels and more open areas on the surface. The claustrophobic metro tunnels contrast with the desolate landscapes above ground, offering a varied and visually interesting world to explore. The attention to detail in the environments adds to the overall sense of immersion.

Replayability: ★★★☆☆
While Metro 2033 Redux offers multiple endings based on player choices, the linear nature of the narrative and the scarcity of resources may limit replayability for some. However, the gripping story and the immersive atmosphere may still encourage some players to revisit the Moscow Metro for a second or third playthrough.

Overall: ★★★★☆
Metro 2033 Redux is a testament to the power of storytelling in video games. With its atmospheric graphics, engaging narrative, and chilling soundtrack, it successfully delivers an immersive post-apocalyptic experience. While the gameplay mechanics may show signs of age, the overall package makes Metro 2033 Redux a must-play for fans of atmospheric shooters and narrative-driven games.",1702619584,1702619584,True,7,0,0.608121275901794434,0,True,False,False

There's an overwhelming feeling of gritty desperation in the art style that conveys the mental image of what living underground in subway tunnels would truly be like, especially in the older tunnels of post Soviet Russia. The game delivers a solid survival/action experience I would compare to The Last of Us in terms of depth and development.

Технічно гра непогана, був здивований, бо спершу проходив третю частину, а зараз вирішив першу. І майже все було взято з цієї першої частини, але просто кращі текстури і розвиток сюжету. 

Категорично не сподобалося сюжетне розкриття ""антагоніста"" і кінцівки. Просто задонать на початку кілька дорогоцінних пуль бомжам, нікого не вбивай (В ШУТЕРІ ТВОЮМАТІНКУНЕХАЙ), або просто вирубай їх ударом з локоточка, і тоді в тебе буде хороша кінцівка. При цьому, більшість ворогів - прибічники ворожих, небезпечних фракцій, і залюбки вбили б вас у спину. А стелс-механіка працює на рівні атарві і викінь. В дізоноред наприклад набагато краще продумано цей момент, і якщо наприклад нікого не вбивати - це, по-перше, дозволить головному герою прославитися і заробити хорошу репутацію, адже він був помічником королеви чи кого там, по-друге - більшість ворогів - це лише звичайні люди, які залежать від влади і її наказів. В метро у нас просто треба бути хорошим (що максимально не реалістично, і якщо це дань книзі, то це тупорила дань, бо книгу написати може кожен, наділити долею героя, прєдназначєніє і тому подібне, додали б ще поні туди чи шо). Якщо ти будеш вбивати противників, то в тебе буде погана кінцівка. 

Стосовно кінцівки - конфлікт з чорними ніяк не розкривається. Вони просто погані і повинні померти. Я не читав усіх заміток, але якщо сюжет про них був розказаний в цих замітках, то це тільки погіршує ситуацію. Давайте замість кіно читати книжки, клас! Чи дають нам вибір, якби ми через сюжет зрозуміли, що вони, наприклад, не погані? Не дають, ми просто типу зомбовані, і якщо погано себе поводили - то всьо, погана кінцівка. Чи були до цього вибори, які спричинили нашу зомбацію? Не було, хіба що вибором можна назвати стиль гри. Спершу буде реп без рим, потім п*р*о без баб, а потім - шутер без пострілів. Занадто тупо і однобоко. А шкода. 

А ще є баги. Деякі ключі не заспавнились. Ну і кривувато загалом. Напевно, для свого часу це було класно, але зараз це розчарування.",1702484195,1702484195,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

you play a soldier who has never fired a gun and has no muscle, hence the absurd recoil that forces you to shoot like a barn door is a pinpoint sniper target.
i then got to a market and had the game completely freeze every time i tried to modify a shotgun there. can buy the gun and all others, plus mod all others, but when i try to back out from mod section for this shotgun, freeze. have to sign out of windows to shut it down.
had no issues that seem to be common for others but the ridiculous recoil that had my shotgun bouncing out of my hands with every shot (clearly a bug as was doing things not physically possible) and machine guns not much better, i then got stuck leaving the town with another character where we got surrounded by demons. here i fell into a loop of being killed instantly by one from behind, even though my back was to a corner wall. with a shotgun doing things physically impossible, after 12 times of reloading checkpoint and trying yet again i had enough. 

had i not bought on the cheap i would be livid, but i paid a pittance and is now only good as a library filler, nothing more.

This game was truly ahead of it's time, it's the first time I play it never played it on release in 2010 even tho I owned it and I really slept on this game.

The voice actor in english have a very funny accent/realistic it makes the immersion even better. 

The gun's feels genuine and it's really engaging, hard thing to get right but the mechanics to me were perfect. Never really ran out of ammo even on survival, all guns are equally fun to play except the flamethrower. Because I just hate flamethrowers. 

The length of the story (finishing just under 10 hours) was perfect (bought it for 2$) because I don't like drawn out game just for the sake of playtime/money spent. I like games that know where they need to wrap up or to put it at a good pace.

I played in survival mode which was the original mode and it felt truly sometime immersive like ""GET OFF ME YOU RADIOACTIVE MONKEY"".

This is the redux version which if I understood correctly is the remastered version so I don't know much about graphics in the non-redux version but expect graphics from an AAA game from 2010 but like way better.

Boy oh boy, I should have robbed a bank sooner because I couldn't believed I MISSED playing this gem earlier!

Metro 2033 is a perfect suit for any survival crackhead like me, a great balance between desolated horror of post-apocalypse and hopeful optimistic narrative it tries to evoke. It definitely is not something new in literature but this one certainly touches the right spot. The atmosphere really digged in me but I couldnt stop playing because somehow I cared about this young russian lad traversing the sewers beneath crumbled Moscow.

The game, based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novel, has been enhanced and revamped in the Redux edition, providing players with improved graphics, gameplay mechanics, and overall polish.

From the very beginning, the game establishes a unique and atmospheric tone. The opening scenes thrust you into the desolate and dark world of the Moscow Metro, setting the stage for the challenges and horrors that lie ahead. The revamped graphics immediately catch the eye, portraying a hauntingly beautiful but dangerous environment that begs exploration.

As you progress, the game's atmospheric world-building becomes increasingly apparent. The attention to detail in the metro stations, the desolate landscapes above ground, and the mutated creatures that roam the tunnels contribute to an immersive storytelling experience. The Redux edition's enhanced visuals showcase the eerie beauty of this post-apocalyptic setting, making every moment visually striking.

The gameplay in Metro 2033 Redux seamlessly blends intense first-person shooter action with survival horror elements. From the outset, ammunition is scarce, encouraging players to think strategically about resource management. The diverse array of weapons and customization options allows for different approaches to combat, adding depth to the overall gameplay.

The narrative unfolds as a dark and compelling story, exploring themes of survival, morality, and the consequences of human actions in the face of extreme adversity. The characters you encounter are well-developed, and their stories contribute to the emotional weight of the overall narrative.

Playing Metro 2033 Redux at night elevates the experience to a new level. The carefully crafted lighting and shadow effects, coupled with the game's haunting ambient soundtrack, intensify the sense of isolation and fear. The subdued lighting and environmental details create a captivating ambiance, making nighttime gameplay a uniquely immersive and spine-chilling experience.

In essence, Metro 2033 Redux may not showcase the pinnacle of 2023 graphics, but its ability to deliver a compelling narrative, engaging gameplay, and a truly atmospheric experience sets it apart. It proves that a game's appeal goes beyond cutting-edge visuals, offering a testament to the timeless power of well-crafted storytelling and gameplay.",1702178223,1702178223,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not full of a ton of systems that aren't well-thought out, just a tuned gaming experience that borders between experiencing a novel in the medium of a game at times, and like an action movie at others.  The story is great, with the backdrop being common Russian sci fi tropes which are always great, like in S.T.A.L.K.E.R or any of the Roadside Picnic - spawned entertainment. So dystopian, apocalyptic future post-nuclear event with fascist factions vying for power amongst a deeper struggle with other entities.

The developers specifically tried to make every level a new experience, so sometimes you have a crazy chase sequence, and sometimes you stealth, sometimes you massacre large groups of enemies.  Overall a well paced, and fun game.  And you can get it on sale for dirt cheap, so definitely worth experiencing atleast once.

I would say 8 hrs to finish this game but if you actually take your time and interact with your surroundings unlike my first playthrough, it would be much longer.

Buy it! Although for me wait for a sale since its much more worth it if its on like 50%. I bought the whole saga for 90% off because of VR Fest 2023. 

The story is REALLY GOOD. GAMEPLAY IS GOOD TOO. Play this then Last Light then Exodus after that because the story is really good. I wont talk about what's the story that much but I will say the slow journey of the Main Character and the Main Character making like these diaries or something every start of the level where he talks.

Spoiler kinda:

I love how the MC becomes from a normal civilian to a Ranger of an elite group! Although you will fully experience this on Last Light and mostly on Exodus.",1702124224,1702124224,True,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

Metro 2033 was a game i've seen and heard about. At first, I didn't think much about it. Back then when this game originally came out, I was over the whole zombies apocalypse stuff you'd see being pumped out year in and year out. Every company wanted to be like Call of duty black ops zombies. It got really repetitive, and saturated. Metro 2033 redux is a very compelling story were your world is infested with monsters. It's a world where you cannot breath the air since it's polluted with harmful toxins. You always have to put your safety mask on, and it makes me appreciate the fact that you can go outside and breath the air without the fear of suffocation. 

The gameplay is simple, you basically shoot the demon monsters. There are humans that will hunt you down to stop your progress to reach to Polis. On the way you'll meet up with other comrades and see how they live underground. The community, the people, kids. How they all live underground, and you feel for them. Like how did life get all sh** like this? Even though this is a fictional world, it makes you wonder. If life got so bad, could it ever turn out to be like this? Like if all computers failed, and everything went corrupt. What would life be like with limited resources? This game makes you think if there are ways to overcome an apocalypse, and thats essentially the mission in this game. 

I never read the books that this game was based off, but I really do want to now. I really like the world, although depressing. You see another side to Moscow Russia that you would have never imagined, and that vision was done perfectly for Metro 2033 redux. I'd HIGHLY recommend this game, if you want a story that will you grab your attention to the very end. You MUST Check out Metro 2033 Redux.

first, the game is GREAT very immersive for the most part, I say that because of the very noticeable bugs that are scattered around the game. It's nothing game breaking if you're worried, minor things like characters clipping forward while running, bricks staying in the air, so on. what also kind of breaks the immersion is the occasionally corny and poorly acted voices. Its mainly the children and some side characters, but switching the audio to the Russian dub gives it more of a authentic feeling.

I often times find myself confused during playing some FPS games of where to go, Metro's compass has fixed this issue for me buy actually being really accurate and reliable. The game plays very smoothly, with INCREDIBLE gun play, movement and mechanics. 

Metro's story is also very well written as a whole, probably since the writer of the original novel was on the writing team, some dialog felt a bit clunky and fell off some times but it really is not that bad. 

Was this game good? Yes. 
Was it scary? Very.

[h3]Settings:[/h3]
[list]
[*]Played on Survival + Ranger Hardcore
[*]Crosshair off
[*]Hints off
[*]Max graphics; advanced PhysX
[/list]

[h3]Expectations:[/h3]

I was expecting a linear STALKER with how major fans talk up this game and talk about its similarity to STALKER. I expected that I would be missing some information about how the game is played due to turning off hints, but I was recommended the above settings by the accompanying Metro Discord community.

[h2]Pros:[/h2]
[list]
[*]Environments are delightfully interactable and fully featured. lots of little cool details; lots of it occurs via voice acting, which can be hit or miss
[*]There's a ton of little conversations here and there between characters that you can easily miss (that are actually interesting and not pointless drivel like other games)
[*]Visuals are fantastic
[*]Actual human vs human combat is pretty solid and reminiscent of STALKER in how dangerous it can be.
[*]Silhouettes, anomalies, etc are really reminiscent of STALKER
[*]Neat details of looting, like pushing corpses over to get access to pockets 
[*]The later parts of the game where you are no longer handheld are pretty good. A bit tough to handle due to the sheer amount of enemies, but handleable and fun. Very linear though
[*]Scorpions are cool as FUCK and a super smart use of the flashlight
[/list]

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
[list]
[*]QOL/Bugs
[list]
[*]Boot up sequence takes you a full minute to get to the main menu. I'm not exaggerating.
[*]Intro/end cutscene is 30 fps
[*]There's the normal difficulty selection when you start a new game, but there's also Normal and Hardcore in the options. There is no explanation for this; I had to ask in the Discord
[*]Subtitles are extremely large for no reason
[*]In the mission where you get to the library, there is a trap that has an invisible trigger. It's debris falling from the library. There is no hint/signal anywhere that this is a trap, just kinda happens.
[*]If you shoot lurkers as they come out of the tunnel and kill them instantly, they finish the animation of exiting the tunnel and THEN die. Lurkers also have issues with frequent random clipping into the ground, making them invincible when they approach you as your bullets don't hit them.
[/list]

[*]AI & NPCs
[list]
[*]Friendly NPCs dont walk/run as fast as you
[*]NPC dialogue (so far) is tending to be on the CoD side of trying to be badass over realistic (STALKER does this too)
[*]The voice acting is really bad at times (STALKER does this too)
[*]Khan's (a friendly NPC in the game) mysterious shtick is just honestly really annoying lol
[*]Often enemies will only attack you and not friendly AI, even when said friendlies are in the way between the monster and you
[/list]

[*]Game & Enemy Design
[list]
[*]Game begins with an intro where you climb up a rusty ladder which breaks and barely get caught in time. Not a good first impression unless you're trying to set the tone for a generic linear shooter (this is 5D foreshadowing rofl)
[*]You are handheld by AI for almost every encounter in the first 3-4 hours of the game.
[*]Red flashing constantly when you are immensely hurt. It doesn't stop until you get health. WHY?
[*]This game is not immersive. Running from 15+ cops firing assault weapons at me and magically dodging them all as well as watching a friendly jump-stab a Nazi (that he could've shot) who was about to execute me is fucking Call of Duty tier shit, not an ""immersive shooter"". It's about as immersive as Wolfenstein.
[*]Melee hitreg is awful. Speaking of melee combat, if you sneak up on someone and try to backstab, it'll do the animation even though the regular melee is an instant kill. This can cause scenarios where the animation is screwing you over because it gives enemies too much time to potentially see you and blow your cover.
[*]STEALTH: Not Good. The stealth AI is awful, and they're terrible at clearing a room; they seem to not be able to see you if you aren't in the path of their searchlight, which is serviceable if your stealth sequences are at night, but one stealth sequence was at sunset, and they definitely should've seen me but didn't. Also, there is a three minute (at best) uninterrupted stealth sequence where you have to sneak through the Communists' side of a warzone and then the Nazis' side of the warzone. It's awful and I had to exploit dumb AI in order to do it. There is no checkpoint for a very long time (much longer than what is normal for the game). Suppressors also don't make a noticeable difference on your ability to be stealthy (hello???).
[*]The Librarians are cool in concept, but the effect it has of you having to memorize where the holes and doors are while one slowly stalks you and the other is flanking you is awful.
[/list]
[/list]

[h3]Cons Specific to My Settings[/h3]
My difficulty options, while more immersive, did actually end up affecting my experience of the game. Here are some of the various issues I encountered that I am certain or at least believe stem from my setting selection.
[list]
[*]No UI showing for QTEs. i just had to spam M1, W, and E and guess one of them will do the trick lol
[*]I've had to look up multiple times how to do basic things like how to select my throwing knives. Can't do it though cuz no weapon wheel. 
[*]You cannot aim down sights with the shotgun. This is only bad because you don't have a crosshair.
[*]Looting consists of mashing E everywhere; ammo and other resources don't stand out enough to be selective about where you press E.
[*]Friendly NPCs (whom you fight with a LOT) do not do as much damage as you (they do more like a quarter of the damage you do); it's generally a good idea to let them do most of the fighting (which isn't immersive) and stay a distance away to avoid wasting ammo, only using it to help yourself. This is most important in the end-game after you leave for the library due to there not being another ammo shop past this point. Had some pretty major close calls with ammo.
[*]Hold M and then press right click to bring up your HUD and ammo counts. I did not know this was a thing at all until the very end of the game.
[*]You can charge your flashlight by holding F and then clicking mouse 1. I didn't know this was a thing until I accidentally held F for too long.
[*]You cannot carry a third weapon. It says you can in the binds, but you can't due to the Ranger Hardcore difficulty.
[*]It appears that there's some sort of moral system in place; this is not made obvious to you if you are not familiar with the game already. I noticed it due to musical cues, but it's very easy to miss.
[/list]

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]
Metro 2033 is not STALKER. I'd say it's not even close enough comparatively for fans of STALKER's gameplay to enjoy it. What I will say is that it fills a middle ground if someone was put off by STALKER's sheer difficulty and slower-paced gameplay, but wanted to experience the atmosphere and ideas. I don't hate Metro 2033, but I definitely don't love it. If I want COD, I'd play COD. If I want STALKER, I'm playing STALKER.

Metro 2033 Redux typically takes 10 to 12 hours to complete the main storyline. Players who explore and immerse themselves in the game's atmosphere may spend over 15 hours, while those focusing solely on the main story can finish in around 8 to 10 hours. Overall, playtime varies based on individual preferences.

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 13/20[/b]

Metro 2033 Redux features dynamic gameplay elements that complement its gripping narrative. Survival is paramount as players manage a gas mask and filters, emphasizing the harsh post-apocalyptic environment. A robust weapon customization system allows for personalized arsenals, and a currency system based on high-value bullets introduces a risk-reward dynamic. The adaptive enemy AI keeps encounters unpredictable, demanding varied strategies. These gameplay nuances, including the dynamic environment, survival mechanics, weapon customization, currency system, and adaptive AI, contribute to an immersive and challenging post-apocalyptic experience unlike any other. However, there are quite a few drawbacks.
 
Let's now address the flaws of the gameplay aspect of Metro 2033 Redux, which stands out as a significant weakness in this Redux package. The gameplay remains unchanged from the original release and feels outdated and clunky. While the developers didn't make notable improvements, addressing these minor issues could have significantly improved the overall experience. The input from the keyboard and mouse seem detached, especially noticeable at higher difficulty levels. The interactive elements also fall short of modern gaming standards, sometimes resembling a game from the early 2000s rather than a newer title. Although the object interaction functions correctly most of the time, there are instances where it frustratingly fails to react as intended. Managing items in close proximity becomes an annoyance, with the game often selecting the wrong thing. Navigating ladders can be problematic as well.

The game's combat mechanics, particularly mutant attacks, exhibit glitches, making it challenging to evade damage despite quick reactions. Two-thirds of all mutant attacks seem unavoidable, leading to accumulating frustration. Throwable items, like explosive grenades, suffer from their own specific issues, making precise throws impossible. However, molotovs and knives perform as expected. In close combat scenarios, the melee weapon proves useless once you run out of bullets, and attempting to escape may not always be a viable solution. A tip: conserve ammo and use your companion soldiers as shields when necessary. Unfortunately, the absence of a FOV (Field of View - TotalBiscuit's biggest nightmare) slider is notable. Attempts to adjust FOV values in the config file can lead to unsatisfactory results, pulling the camera back to the point of breaking animations. Consequently, sticking with the original FOV is recommended to maintain a visually pleasing experience.

[b]Rating: 15/20[/b]

Regarding graphics quality, the game's atmosphere and surroundings stand out as the main positive aspects. However, outdoor environments appear somewhat flat and incomplete compared to indoor areas. Additionally, the lack of customizable graphical options is a notable drawback. It's worth mentioning occasional flashing visual glitches indoors and outdoors. The soundtrack complements the story well and is a strong point. Weapon sounds are impressive, dialogue is decent, and ambient sounds contribute to a realistic atmosphere. On the downside, Artyom's grunting sounds during actions like jumping seem mismatched, detracting from the overall experience.

Crowd and enemy dialogue, initially bearable, becomes repetitive upon closer inspection. Regarding visuals, examining the crowd reveals that a significant portion consists of identical models with minor variations in hairstyles and outfits. This lack of diversity can be immersion-breaking for those who notice such details. The game's animation system generally meets expectations for the genre and scale of the game. However, mutant animations are subpar and fall flat compared to the rest of the presentation. The inaccurate movement occasionally leads to missed melee attacks or jumps, as I discussed in the gameplay section.

[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 20/20[/b]

Metro 2033 Redux is a gripping first-person shooter set in the post-apocalyptic ruins of Moscow. Two decades after a devastating nuclear war, survivors now inhabit the underground metro tunnels, struggling to survive against mutated creatures and hostile factions. As Artyom, a young man born before the apocalypse, players embark on a dangerous journey across the desolate metro system. Artyom's quest becomes a brutal exploration of the human spirit in the face of extinction. The game combines intense combat, atmospheric storytelling, and a hauntingly immersive world to deliver a memorable experience in the haunting depths of a shattered society. The narrative stands out as a unique and exceptional experience in gaming, with no similar title coming close to its originality. The numerous small pieces contribute to a captivating storyline, seamlessly transitioning and expanding into Metro: Last Light.

However, when it comes to the replay value, unless you're one of those gamers dedicated to unlocking every achievement, there's not much to it after the initial playthrough. Worth noting is that Metro 2033 is not that type of game. While the game features collectibles, such as safes containing bullets and notes resembling journals that enhance the story's depth, the overall gameplay is relatively linear. Beyond a handful of brief side activities, the freedom of traversal is limited. The characters you interact with have depth and don't just fill the area, and every detail serves a purpose, be it in gameplay or story. The game revolves around small, dark, and narrow tunnels and does an exceptional job of creating an atmosphere that feels real and engaging. Despite some shortcomings, the strength of the narrative and the attractive metro environments compensate well for any drawbacks.

[h1][b]Technicalities[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 17/20[/b]

Even upon its initial launch, the game's system requirements were high, and that release frequently served as a benchmark. Back then, if a system could handle Metro 2033 and the original Crysis, it could play anything. All Metro games, including this one, need powerful PC hardware, a point worth noting. While the Redux version should run smoothly on modern hardware, it's advisable to bear this in mind. Upon launching the game for the first time, something will be missing. Hmmm, what could it be? Vsync! Even on high-refresh-rate monitors, Metro 2033 Redux caps itself at 60 FPS.

Despite attempting various methods to remove this FPS cap with Vsync enabled (on a 165Hz Gsync monitor), nothing appears to work. Nvidia's Fast Sync in the control panel proves ineffective, and modifications to the configuration file don't produce positive results either. Consequently, there are two ways to play the game: either tolerate the 60 FPS cap with Vsync enabled (which, frankly, feels less smooth and underutilizes the system's potential for a higher framerate) or deal with unattractive screen tearing by disabling Vsync and unlocking the framerate. The FPS cap is about the only bad thing tech-wise.

[h1][b]Final Verdict[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 85/100[/b]

Metro 2033 Redux combines an impressive narrative and improved visuals, puts them carefully into some of the most captivating and unique locations in any video game, and mixes it with unimpressive gameplay that doesn't take away from its unforgettable experience that will forever stay in your memory.

The story is interesting, thanks to the novel it is based on. In the beginning of every level, there is a book-styled note that tells us main character thoughts. I thinks its great.

Graphics are very beautiful.

[h1]What I didn't like[/h1]
First of all, there are no manual saves, only checkpoints. It is a big problem, because checkpoints are not always placed correctly, and it's annoying to re-spawn at the middle of the level when you almost completed it, but accidentally died.

Secondly, weapons behavior is a bit questionable. It takes 1 magazine of automatic rifle, or 4 shotgun shells to kill a monster, but killing the same monster with tiny revolver takes only 2 bullets.

Thirdly, stealth is awkward. When you stand, enemies notice you even through a concrete wall. When you crouch, you can be almost in front of enemies eyes and they will not see you.",1686911051,1701186860,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-The game doesn't use raw mouse input (fixed by mod)

The storytelling has triumphant and explosive moments, and keeps you guessing what sort of nightmarish creature is around each corner. This game sets itself apart from other FPS experiences by incorporating small realistic mechanics such as charging up your manual crank-battery night vision and flashlight, as well as keeping track of gas mask and filter quality, which is of vital importance in areas that have a dangerous atmosphere. I enjoyed the combat and the designs of the creatures and especially the winged 'Demons'!

TOP FUN THINGS TO DO:
⭐️ Exploring this post-apocalyptic world.
⭐️ Feeling overrun with hell beasts.
⭐️ Hardcore ranger mode will test your skills.

THE UNIQUES:
💎 Some weapons / gadgets require to be pumped.
💎 Playing things stealthily and passive will reward you moral points.
💎 Immense story.

PLAYER GAMING REQUIREMENTS:
💼 FPS.
💼 Post-apocalyptic.
💼 Story Rich.

PROS:
+ A huge upgrade from the original Metro 2033 version. (Look up the comparisons on YouTube)
+ Deep survival elements, bullets are scarce (In ranger mode) and attacks laid on you are impactful it's truly the best way to play Metro.
+ Military bullets are treated as currency.
+ Weaponry feels detailed with it's post-apocalyptic to thank for. Aka, some weapons require to be pumped.
+ Enemies attack with speed, which enhances your reactions.
+ It's atmospheric to the final detail, the fog setting once outside the tunnels all the way to wiping the blood and grime from your gas-mask to see.
+ The story is good enough to be turned into a movie, there's already books about it so a movie wouldn't be a huge stretch.

CONS:
- It's a short game. (About 9 hours to complete)
- Modding your weapons is a little lacking.
- Shooting from the hip feels most effective.... which I don't like.

VERDICT:
I'm here to say that this game deserves every positive review it receives, I never had the honour to play it's original release but the Redux version is truly a masterpiece to the Metro collection. If you have this game sitting in your library, don't hesitate any longer, you're missing out on a game of a lifetime. Same to the players who don't own this, it's cheap enough to obtain and well worth your time. If I realised this sooner, I would've played Metro 2033 many years ago.

Total Score = 93/100.

GAMEPLAY:
The story is based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novel of the same name, where survivors of a nuclear war have taken refuge in the Metro tunnels of Moscow. Players control Artyom, a man who must save his home station from the dangers lurking within the Metro. In the game, players encounter human and mutant enemies, who can be killed with a variety of firearms. Players must also wear a gas mask to explore areas covered in fallout radiation, both underground and on the surface.

You could go back to the tunnels and be relieved to find some bandit group; at least they're still human. But you realize you're in an abandoned Metro station.

So, while I was perusing Steam sales one day, I came on Metro 2033 Redux on sale. I'd read a lot about Metro Exodus and the shenanigans with Steam and the Epic Game store, but I'd heard good things about this one and thought I would give it a try. While I can't say it was horrible, I didn't really care for it.

Metro 2033 takes place in Moscow, after a nuclear war has devastated the surface. Survivors have taken refuge in the tunnels of the Moscow subway, turning stations into makeshift habitats. Political factions struggle for control, individual stations struggle for survival, and mutants, bandits, and other dangers lurk in the tunnels between stations, to say nothing of what's going on above ground. The player is cast in the role of Artyom, a young man on a mission to deliver his message to a larger station-village to seek help for own settlement, and the story is off.

Control scheme is fairly standard, as is interaction with objects and individuals. On top of difficulty, there are two game modes: Spartan and Survival. The latter makes Metro 2033 more of a horror-survival game, where Spartan makes more ammo available and makes the character more durable. In theory.

The game's progression is fairly linear as Artyom makes his way through the tunnels and occasional jaunts above ground into the stormy ruin of Moscow. The underground areas are dark and dank and enemies pop out at any time (above ground isn't much better). Some areas are littered with tripwires that ignite painful or fatal traps, though the player can disarm most of these. A handful of these areas have neat and unique challenges, such as the area where the Soviet Reds and reborn Nazis are fighting it out. Both will kill Artyom, so you have to decide to sneak through, or gun them all down, or some blend of the two. There are areas, especially above ground, where Artyom's gas mask is crucial and managing his limited supply of canisters for the mask becomes challenging. At different points, you will have NPC partners, though they generally go their own way after a short period, or get pasted by enemies. The depot stations en route usually offer a place to barter for weapons, ammunition, and other supplies--though, as a side note, .44 Magnum ammunition in Russia felt like a mistake (there is a caliber called "".44 Russian"" but Magnum ammo was not commonly used in the country then or now) but I admit, that's just me nitpicking.

Two small things I did like. One, currency in the metro is in the form of military-grade rounds made before the war. These rounds are exchanged for other ammo and supplies. They can also be used in some weapons and are far more powerful than ammo made after the war. This means that when faced with difficult fights, the player must choose whether or not to literally fire money away. I like that dilemma. Two, the player had a handheld charger for their flashlights and night-vision goggles. They must bring it out at times and actually click to re-power their equipment. It's a small touch but beats the items recharging on their own or having to wait for a recharge station or something.

There are beasts to fight and kill, and enemy humans who will do their best to gun down the player. I found the combat to be more frustrating than anything. Combat against humans is relatively straightforward. The mutant enemies, however, seem made of iron. They thrash you around, messing up your camera angle and making it hard to fire. The hit boxes for enemies felt quite small; I repeatedly unloaded double-shotgun blasts into ape-like mutants called nosalis ... only for them to keep attacking. I guess I was missing but seriously? At point-blank range with a shotgun, when they're filling the screen, you ought to hit more than you miss. Even in Spartan mode, ammo is never overly plentiful and you are often attacked by many enemies at a time. You can carry medkits but they are literally too slow to use in combat. Enemies continue ripping you limb from limb for the duration of the two-second healing animation, making it almost pointless, except as a ""between waves"" thing. Is the delay more realistic? Sure. Does it make for a better game? Debatable.

While in general I didn't mind the combat sequences in the tunnels (even some of the ones set on railcars, the style of which I normally abhor), I hated the ones outdoors, or the outdoor levels in general. Whereas the tunnels are pretty easy to navigate, the outdoor areas are nebulous and there's often no clear direction as to where to go. That would be fine, but for the fact that your rapidly dwindling mask canisters are all that stand between you and suffocating. If you run past a doorway or something, it may take you precious minutes to backtrack and find it, when every second counts. The monsters blend into the scenery even more above ground than in the tunnels. I actually preferred them bounding out of the dark because at least if I got my light on, I could see them. I died multiple times when a monster attacked from a bush and was knocking me around so much I could literally see nothing but red and shrub. Because the game works on a crappy checkpoint save system, that means starting the level over, at least partway.

None of this even mentions the bat-like demons who sweep down and toss you to the ground from high above. Fortunately, to the point I played, they only appeared outdoors.

While the story was generally interesting and the depot ""cities"" were well-rendered and filled with interesting ambiance (such as listening to all the side conversations of the citizens), I found the heavy Russian accents highly annoying. I mean, the player's character is Russian, all the other characters are Russian, and they won't hear their own accents. It all should have been subtitled with the original language still spoken, or just spoken in plain English. Pet peeve of mine.

I didn't experience any crashes or instability issues. The game seemed to load quickly and run pretty well, so that was nice. I also didn't get a lot of Steam achievements done in my partial run but they all seem doable, just based on reading the descriptions, though it will take at least two play-throughs to get them all (completing a full game each in Spartan and Survival modes).

I made it to Polis Station, which someone told me is about 2/3 of the way through. After dying multiple times in the following segment and exhausting supplies, I realized I just wasn't having fun. Some will say ""get good, noob."" That's fine. But not for something I'm really not enjoying that much in the first place. I expect players that like the challenge and the horror elements will like this but honestly, I've played survival horror like Bioshock and System Shock 2 that were simply more fun to me.

Metro 20033 wasn't quite what I was looking for. I might revisit this sometime in the future when I'm feeling the urge to try something different. If I do, I'll update this review. But for now, I'm going to give the rest of it a pass.

Pros
- Some interesting game elements and level design
- Players who like a challenge will probably enjoy it

Cons
- Crappy combat mechanics
- Outdoor areas are not fun
- Checkpoint-only save system

Metro 2033 offers a great FPS horror survival experience! The game has a linear story with a decent level exploration initiated by the need to find resources for your suvival, both on the surface and underground, and by the curiosity to find out the full story from the perspective of Artyom, your character, by collecting his journal pages scattered across the levels. 

Honestly if you think you would like to play it but are not sure, just go for it! I do not know how the Metro books are but this game has been very fun to play given that I usually do not enjoy playing horror games. I don't know how the next games in the collection are but will give them a go as well, given how this is proving to be (I haven't finished it as of writing this review, but I believe I am close to the end).

It definitely gives you the feeling of traveling unsafely underground, surrounded by cobwebs, ruined structures, radioactive pollution, abandoned places, corpses and all kinds of mutated creatures. But there are already other games that give you some of these, so what makes Metro different? Although Metro seems like a classic thriller - FPS game at first glance, it is actually one of the best anti-war works of art ever created. The game literally pushes you to think about the damage of wars to both humanity and the nature, thanks to its atmosphere and scenario, as well as game mechanics.

You get ""morality points"" towards the good ending by exploring (and looting) out of the way spots, listening to incidental conversations all the way through (civilians and enemies both), doing good deeds and avoiding enemy casualties. If you explore well enough, you can skip the pacifist angle and still get the good ending though.

Don't worry about getting separated from your allies. They will always wait for you to finish exploring, safe and sound.

In the Redux version of the game, many stealth sections are based around advancing as far as you can without being detected to trigger a conversation that will make the enemies move on to more convenient spots. If you're playing the original version, this doesn't happen, and stealth is mostly a way to thin out the enemies before the inevitable firefight.

Throwing knives, if you score a good hit with them, will stealthily instakill most enemies and you can pick the knife back up. Don't forget about them.

The revolver is a very reliable weapon and can take you through the entire game, though not worth silencing. If you're killing people stealthily the throwing knives are a much better option anyway.

Listen to NPC chatter. Seriously: the stories they tell are absolutely beautiful at times, and really draw you in.

Early on you get a chance to spend some time with a prostitute. Don't do this unless you want to lose all your money.

Buy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of ammo at every shop (but when a dude tells you to buy gas mask filters, get those first)

The game will automatically force Artyom to switch filters when one runs out. The only reason to switch manually is to avoid the distraction in the middle of combat / if you hate listening to choking noises.

The Helsing gun is very powerful and has reusable ammo - you pretty much need it to finish the game as one part has a lot of strong enemies that simply suck up ammo (In the Redux version, you *really* want to avoid fighting these, Helsing or no).

Long-range scopes are practically useless - you never fight at a range that will require sniping.",1699867579,1699867579,True,3,0,0.555555582046508789,0,True,False,False

Basically just a standard follow the story FPS that is seen in many other games such as Bioshock Infinite, Call of Duty, Wolfenstein etc. Graphics are absolutely top-notch, and the lighting gives the game an amazing atmosphere. Music is ok, nothing exceptional, but the voice acting is good and npc's that you interact with are really well done and make the game very immersive (apart from the children's voices...omg!). The combat is great and I really enjoyed the stealth option on certain levels.

For the negatives, I felt the game didn't give you much info or tutorials on the weapons or equipment you were using and just let you figure it out for yourself. I love the idea of not being hand-held throughout games, but I did feel at times it needed to explain a little more on certain things. The compass and clipboard felt very clumsy to use, infact the whole UI was a bit arkward to use, especially for things like grenades or throwing knives. It will probably take a couple of playthroughs to fully get to grips with how everything works.

I did enjoy it though, it's atmospheric, very immersive, and looks amazing and the story kept me hooked all the way through, but for me it just lacked that extra special something to push it to the next level.

A solid atmospheric immersive story-driven FPS, and would definitely recommend it.

Damn, what a game. Before this, I haven't heard of the Metro franchise but holy shit I should've found it sooner. Metro 2033 Redux is a remaster of, of course, Metro 2033, which itself is a video game adaptation of Dmitry Glukhovsky's science fiction novel, Metro 2033. Set in Moscow and its' tunnels 20 years after a nuclear holocaust caused by WW3, Artyom must explore the Metro to find help in defending his home station against the next evolution of mankind. After running it thrice, finishing the game in Ranger Hardcore and achieving 100%, this game is such an amazing experience. This game's lore is stacked with mysteries, the story is well told (just like the novel), the characters are likable and the enemy variations are enough to make you not feel bored, from humans like communists and fascists to mutants such as nosalises and my God, the librarians. BEWARE OF THE LIBRARIANS. That all due to being kind of an old game, some mechanics are janky like the stealth and movement. I encountered some wall hitboxes that sent me straight through the air and sometimes enemies just instantly found out where you are. In conclusion, Metro 2033 Redux is a masterpiece of a game that planted the seed for an amazing franchise that I will play next, I would RECOMMEND this game.",1698721879,1699459000,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story line is adequate, and the English voice acting is very well done. I would say that this games only weaknesses are that it has a tendency to crash every so often, and that there are a lot of stealth based achievements, but this being an older title, the stealth mechanics don't feel competently fleshed out. This can lead to some frustration when say, you want to knock out human enemies, or do stealth kills, or using the throwing knives, (which for me was really troublesome because it's a little janky. Especially when fighting fast moving foes.) However, if you can look past this minor inconvenience then this game is very solid. It has many S.T.A.L.K.E.R. references in it as well, so personally, I would recommend that you play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl at least once to get those little hint-hint nudge-nudge moments thrown throughout here-and-there in this game.

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world that is located in the depths of the Moscow Metro. The Redux version of the game features enhanced graphics and refined gameplay, which makes it even more immersive than the original, and a must-play for anyone who loves atmospheric, story-driven shooters.

The game design is incredibly detailed, which immerses players in a world where the last remnants of humanity struggle to survive in the tunnels beneath a destroyed city. The game's attention to detail is remarkable, from the flickering lights and eerie echoes in the dark tunnels to the hauntingly beautiful surface world that has been transformed into a barren wasteland inhabited by terrifying creatures. The game world feels incredibly real and every location in the game has a story to tell, which makes the world-building exceptional and sets Metro 2033 Redux apart from other games.

The game's story is a gripping tale of survival that is filled with hope, despair, and moral dilemmas. Players take on the role of Artyom, a young man trying to save his people from an unknown threat. The game's characters are incredibly well-developed, which makes them feel real, with their own dreams and struggles. Players can't help but become emotionally invested in their fates, which makes the game a truly immersive experience.

The gameplay in Metro 2033 Redux is a well-balanced mix of stealth and intense gunfights, which offers players the freedom to choose their approach. The game's scarcity of resources adds an extra layer of tension to every encounter, forcing players to make tough decisions about how to survive. The game's revamped controls and improved AI in this Redux version make the experience smoother and more satisfying than ever.

The sound design is another area where Metro 2033 Redux excels, adding to the game's emotional impact. The game's sound effects are incredibly immersive, from the eerie whispers of the Metro to the echoing gunshots and the haunting musical score. These elements all contribute to the game's immersive world.

In conclusion, Metro 2033 Redux is a captivating and emotionally charged game that will stay with players long after they've completed the game. If you're looking for a video game that not only offers a gripping story but also an immersive world that tugs at your heartstrings, then Metro 2033 Redux is a must-play. The game's exceptional attention to detail, well-developed characters, and immersive gameplay make it a true masterpiece. Dive into the depths of the Moscow Metro, experience the desolation, fear, and hope, and emerge from the game world as a changed person.",1699415237,1699415237,False,0,0,0.413793116807937622,0,True,True,False

There seems to be so much purpose to Artyoms' journey through the metro tunnels. Seeking help for his home station. The Dark Ones presenting an enemy against which they have no defence. The paranormal / psychological elements to Metro 2033 Redux add a lot of depth to the world.

It's a story of survival in a claustrophobic and dangerous world. The murky tunnels infested with mutants and anomalies, which Artyom would in theory be experiencing for the first time on his own. This anticipation is what I personally enjoyed so much. 

Taking a passive approach see's you act as a fly on the wall. Taking stock of the different factions and ideologies held by groups found in the Metro. Grounded in humanity and the faults that we share. 

Human's are just as violent if not more so than any of the Mutants lurking in the tunnels. The moral choices you are presented allow for different endings, depending on your style of play and interaction. 

Weapon sounds are perfect, and have plenty of weight. The chonky gun models / art style are much preferred personally over the realistic route taken in future titles. 

I will admit that this game does not like to be rushed. 

So take some time to stop and smell the irradiated mushrooms as you stroll through post apocalyptic Russia.

[code] Once again, this game is a masterpiece game. In fact, all Metro series are masterpiece. No matter how old this game was. No problem on the game, no bug, no glitch, no error, everything works fine. Every penny you spent on this game is worth. Sadly for me, I played the wrong sequence. First I played Metro Exodus which was the first game series I purchased and then Metro Last Light and lastly Metro 2033. Metro 2033 and Last Light are connected, exodus is a different story. Overall conclusion, this game is solid go buy it guys it is so good ( if you like post-apocalyptic games).

Pros for me:
+Smooth game play
+ Post apocalyptic
+ Not much adult scene but the story is great
+ Awesome action scene
+ Masterpiece

Cons
+ None at all.

STAY SAFE METRO LOVERS!

Comparison to Metro Exodus ee:
Exodus ee looks better regarding light quality and geometry, has larger levels, better audio, more interactions with characters is a longer game etc.
Exodus ee has worse textures, as they implemented dlss poorly and has major cpu bottlenecks in some areas (sams story).

I found exodus ending to be more creepy, though the ending here in 2033 was not less pleasing and still one hell of a ride!

I only got lost once for 10min in 2033.

* Few levels on Hardcore are obscenely difficult due to enemy AI being overly reactive with instant snapping to you, everything else feels fair
* Resource management is necessary for the feeling of horror and survival, but lack of manual saves creates some moments where if you mess up your planning there's no going back (not objectively bad, just annoying)

For years Metro 2033 was used as a benchmark test for the latest graphics cards, so it feels strange to already be seeing a remastered version hit the digital shelves. It's easy to be cynical and assume that Metro 2033 Redux is aimed squarely at the console market, whose under-TV boxes have only just caught up with Metro 2033's full majesty. It's finally a way for living-room dwellers to see what the game is like with all its video options switched on. But what's the value for PC players?

Well, Metro 2033 Redux is an honest to goodness, genuine remaster. A collection of tweaks and polishes, do-overs and rejigs that elevates the game to even greater heights, this is a full visual revamp that brings it in line with Last Light in terms of graphical tech.

If you haven't played Metro 2033 before, this will now be the best place to start. It's post-apocalyptic FPSing at its finest, with a uniquely grim backdrop and appropriately negative portrayal of mankind in the midst of that. The premise of Metro is that the surface of Earth is scorched and irradiated, so the people of Moscow live within the tunnels of the metro (hey, that's the name of the game!) while the Dark Ones above their heads plot against them.

A feature which gives you the option of bartering high-grade ammunition for better guns/upgrades or using them to, you know, shoot mutants is a standout innovation that creates tension in how you approach combat. Scarcity of ammo is a staple of the survival horror genre, but never before has finding a stash of bullets prompted such an internal conflict.

For a game with a grim colour filter, 2010's 2033 was also remarkably pretty. 2014's version is a marked difference. I'm not talking a little texture upgrade here, I'm talking new meshes, new animations and reworked environments. Metro 2033 Redux is Metro 2033 tweaked and polished to a high standard; this feels like the definitive version of the game 4A originally wanted to make.

Even down to the main menu screen. It's the same, but vastly improved. It's not like the old one is looking particularly weathered, it's just that the difference in production values here make it worth paying for again.

There are other smaller changes to the Redux edition. Cutscenes have been reworked so that the camera never leaves protagonist Artyom's perspective. Again, there was nothing wrong with wresting the non-interactive viewpoint away from the player from time to time in 2033, but such a change demonstrates that this is closer to their vision of how this story should be told. In such a tense, atmospheric game heightening the player's engagement with the narrative like this just feels like common sense.

4A has revisited every aspect of 2033, evident in the improved lighting and weather effects, the expanded environments, added secrets or even the addition of some of Metro: Last Light's better features, like weapon customisation.

So is it worth buying again? Absolutely. Especially since you can grab Metro 2033 Redux for half price on Steam if you already own Metro 2033. If you don't already own it, then $24.99/£17 for an excellent game that you should have played by now anyway is a pretty damn good deal.",1697748293,1697748293,True,7,1,0.562896490097045898,0,True,False,False

Однією з найвидатніших особливостей гри є її атмосфера. Метро-універсум, в якому розгортається дія, є по-справжньому захоплюючим та занурює гравця в постапокаліптичний світ, де людство виживає в підземних тунелях, борючись з небезпечними мутантами та іншими загрозами. Відмінною роботою команди розробників є відтворення цього світу з вражаючою увагою до деталей та атмосферними ефектами, які роблять кожну локацію відчутною та неймовірною.

Геймплей в Metro: 2033 Redux поєднує елементи виживання, стрілянини та експлорації. Ви будете витрачати уважно ресурси, управляти амуніцією та розглядати оточення для виживання. Важливо робити тактичні рішення про те, коли стріляти, а коли приховуватися, оскільки амуніція обмежена, а вороги дуже небезпечні. Ця система гри робить Metro: 2033 Redux особливо відчутною, а надзвичайно різноманітні локації і завдання додають грі варіативності та глибини.

Сюжет Metro: 2033 Redux - це ще один сильний аспект гри. Ви будете подорожувати разом з головним героєм, Артемом, через небезпечний метро-світ, долаючи перепони і розгадуючи таємниці. Цей нарратив відчувається важливим і захоплюючим, з багатьма непередбачуваними поворотами сюжету.

Загалом, Metro: 2033 Redux - це незабутня гра, яка поєднує в собі захоплюючий сюжет, унікальну атмосферу і захоплюючий геймплей. Це гра, яка обов'язково сподобається фанатам постапокаліптичних шутерів та історій виживання.

Cons: 

1: Reliance on Stealth on higher difficulties (Not a problem for me personally) 
2: AI can be very dumb, especially during stealth sections.

The brighter art style of the Redux is clearly just to show off some of the good texture work that goes unnoticed in the original. In all honesty, I prefer the Redux 90 percent of the time. The original lacks plenty of quality of life and immersive elements, such as being able to wipe your mask off. Redux has a clearer stealth system with less frustration and overall better presentation and storytelling; the original has actual cutscenes and shows Artyom's full body at numerous times, whereas the redux goes for a Half-Life style of presentation where the perspective never leaves Artyom's eyes. The benefits to the original are darker, more atmospheric lighting, and much better sound effects.

The story is simple, you are Artyom, a dweller of Exhibition Station, a neutral station in the Metro, where other stations are ruled by factions such as The Red Line (the commies), or The Fourth Reich (the nazis), the Spartan Order (also known as the Rangers, basically a neutral police faction), or The Hanseatic League (aka, the Hansa, the largest and most influential trade faction) Most, especially Hanza, aren't really explained in the game. the Reds and the Fourth Reich are self explanatory, just second iterations of these two political ideologies, however Hanza is largely unknown to you through this game (and the others in the series, its entirely possible to just not know who the Hanza are if you don't read the novels); I had to turn to the book to learn who they actually were. Most factions are obviously your enemy, but Hanza is interesting, as they do present a big threat, but they aren't your enemies, its more their paranoia and suspicion that Artyom has to deal with. You are Artyom, a young man in his early-to-mid 20s and who longs to see the outside world, collecting postcards depicting cities and places all over the world. When your station is compromised by mutants after the arrival of the Ranger Hunter, a friend of your adoptive father, Hunter embarks on a mission, and gives Artyom his Ranger dogtags, telling him to warn the Order of the Dark Ones, a psionic species of creatures that took over the surface after nuclear armaggeddon. Thus you embark on your journey with a single goal, get to the Order and give them Hunter's warning. To do this you'll do through various ordeals, such as sneaking behind enemy lines, dealing with mutants, bandits, etc, and surviving treks to the surface. The story unfolds similarly to Half Life or HL2, with each level feeding into the next in a linear path that feels more like a long journey than a traditional story, as well as the Redux version (this one) never leaving Artyom's perspective.

Graphically, its dated but thanks to good lighting and textures, it holds up fine.
Sound design is great, atmosphere is appropriate and the voice acting is largely good--this game uses a lot of Barbara Goodson, and while she is an iconic voice actor, her voice is super distinctive and doesn't quite work for the various kid roles they gave her; everyone else in the English cast is generally excellent. The one thing is guns don't sound brilliant-most lack punch, with the revolver, using a stock sound effect that you can hear in The Martix, oddly being the punchiest.

Stealth can feel a little underbaked and buggy at times, and the AI is not smart, but those are relatively minor. The original has much smarter AI, but loses the fun of being able to stealth through entire encounters, as without a silent takedown system (except throwing knives), the enemies tend to discover you quickly and force you to drain resources, something that makes later levels much more challenging.

Gameplay is immersive and fun, and never too difficult, as long as you're exploring as much as you can, especially on the Ranger modes. The Redux version of the game also offers a choice between the original 2033's ""Survival"" gameplay or it sequel, Last Light's ""Spartan"" gameplay. Like most people i recommend survival, the resource management and such adds tension to the story that it lacks otherwise.

Playing all three current Metro games sequentially provides a great, immersive world and overall storyline for Artyom as a character.
 
My biggest criticism of the game is with its morality system, moreso its effect of the ending. At various points in the story, Artyom is presented with a moral dilemma. None of them are hard to choose (give a begger a bullet, take ammo as payment from a starving group) and some of them are just given to you for exploring, making it easy to get the good ending of the game where you stop at the last minute from doing something terrible. the problems are A, the bad ending is canonical, meaning if you want the best experience for the whole series, you can't go for the points and B, since some points are just given to you for finding a specific body or room, its really too easy to get the good ending.

The rest of the review is full of spoilers and such so if you've decided to get the game, great, just don't read on. 

I've edited this review multiple times in the last week as ive been doing my second PC playthrough, third overall, and have been reading the books finally. I recommend it if you like this game, there's a lot more to learn about each faction and such through the books, just be wary that the books are absolutely not the same as the games, save 2033 somewhat. Metro 2033 actually adapts the book rather well (with obvious concessions so as to make the game actually fun). The book, once it gets going, starts with the same conversation between Artyom's stepfather (Alex in game, Sukhoi in book) and Hunter, albeit just in different circumstances. Like the game, Exhibition Station (VDNKh), has been under attack, but not from nosalis packs, from the Dark Ones specifically. Like the game, Artyom had, at a very young age, left open the hermetic seals open at the Botanical Gardens, letting the Dark Ones in (something more explored in Last Light), and like the game, has to go to Polis station to find Melnik (Miller being the character and a nickname, in Metro Exodus, he refers to himself as 'Colonel Melnikov'). The actual plot is pretty similar too, from reluctantly going alongside Bourban to meeting and befriending Khan, a tunnel mystic.

If i have a complaint about the entire series, its the fact that characters aren't shared between games, especially Exodus, which gives the player an entire crew of Spartan Rangers, albeit with only 2 that return from older games. In Metro 2033, you'll meet Miller and Ulman, alongside Pavel, Stepan, and Boris (all of whom die trying to either help Artyom accomplish his mission, or during the course of their own duties.) Miller, Ulman, and Khan go on to star in Last Light, but only Miller is in all three. Pavel dies trying to get you to Black Station, and Boris and Stepan die during the capture of D6. Last Light will introduce Anya (Anna) to the main three but those are the only three that go from these first two games to the last (Artyom, Miller, and Anya,) as Exodus introduces several characters that just should've been involved earlier.",1671245780,1694389760,True,9,0,0.654941856861114502,0,True,False,False

You play as Artyom, a silent inexperienced FPS protagonist who has a lot to say in his journal pages about the hellish, dismal but also slightly cozy places he visits, such as crowded metro stations full of worried but hardy refugees as well as the endless winter wastelands of the surface, where you have to wear a gas mask or suffocate on radiation when you're not busy trying to stave off countless giant mutants who want to rip your face off with a devastating three-hit melee combo, plus the frequent groups of trigger happy sociopathic bandit groups.

Story revolves around Artyom's journey to leave home and unravel the mysteries of the enigmatic and feared Dark Ones, shadowy giant humanoid creatures with telepathic powers who leave humans catatonic whenever they make contact. 

There's a certain type of narrative in place for the story and it's not exactly subtle (gameplay loop and moral points scale encourages the player to be stealthy and avoid killing human foes when possible), but aside from that narrative, the gameplay is excellent, one of the best examples of linear thriller stealth horror, even better than Dead Space.

Gameplay is broken up into level sections. Sometimes, you listen to people talk about their hopes and dreams and survival concerns in npc hubs for extra moral points that will help give you access to the good ending, if you want to shoot for it.

Other times, you can spend several minutes at a shop, listening to idle npc chatter and looking over the available firearm upgrades and attachments while debating with yourself on whether or not the military grade rounds you use as money (or extremely rare and powerful flaming machine gun bullets) are worth spending on a stock or a reflex scope or a quad barrel duplet shotgun upgrade when you're likely going to find an equivalent or better upgrade through scavenging corpses tucked away in storage caches in the next level section. If you're good at scavenging, you won't have to buy upgrades or extra ammo or grenades, and the game encourages the player to save MGR rounds for money and/or extreme combat emergencies, but given that you can have over 1000 MGRs in the endgame with nothing to spend it on aside from using them as ammunition against giant gorilla mutants... the player has a lot of flexibility for how they want to spend their hard-earned resources and bullets.

Sometimes, you go up to the surface and have frantic combat encounters with dangerous mutants where you blast away foe after foe with your shotgun of choice. You can also learn that due to the way atmosphere damage accumulates and resets upon putting your gas mask back on, you can get away with taking off Artyom's gas mask for around 3-10 seconds before he suffocates and then put the gas mask back on for a split second. It's a very cheap trick that the devs probably didn't intend with the game engine, but it's a great way to massively extend filter time if you're worried about running out of filters and/or getting your gas mask shattered by mutants and/or bandits, as the gas mask breaks slowly from mutants and breaks quickly when you get shot at with bullets and grenades.

Other times, you have interesting stealth segments that reward the player for using non-lethal melee takedowns from behind unaware roaming hostile humans as you listen to their idle chatter and discover hidden ammo caches and weapons for extra resources and moral points. You can also go guns blazing but it's not recommended due to all of the humans with heavy armor that makes anything other than assault rifle/pistol/metal ball/arrowhead headshots viable, and shotgun rounds are always best saved for mutants. Or you can use your overpowered, infinitely reusable throwing knives to silently kill everyone if you get frustrated by the stealth level layouts and light/flame source positioning, which is also a valid tactic that I myself hesitated to use at first due to the moral points system.

Overall, Metro 2033 Redux and Metro Last Light offer unique gameplay and story experiences that you really don't get from other survival/horror/FPS/TPS games (Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Dead Space, FEAR, those various other games that are post-apocalyptic survival horror similar to Metro like Stalker/Chernobylite, etc). The two games in the Metro trilogy are highly recommended classis, especially if you get the franchise sale bundle.",1694263638,1694263746,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A lot of the game play just mostly consists of you walking in dark hallways and the action isn't too entertaining other than 1 or two levels .Even though i do think that the atmosphere that they created for the game is great, i often found myself wondering and confused on what to do next in the game. More often than not i had to google on what i had to do in a lot of levels because the game doesn't properly teach all the useful mechanics. I feel that this game would have worked better if more hints and/or instructions were added.

A lot of people say that the real highlight of this game is the story. And yes i did feel that the story of this game is genuinely better than most considering that its adapting a highly acclaimed novel. But quite honestly for me, the story doesn't really matter if the game play in itself isn't entertaining.

I don't really recommend this game to any FPS fans out there. There are a shit ton of FPS games out there that offer high octane action and/or great story and atmosphere for more or less the same price. (Black Mesa, F.E.A.R, Trepang2, L4D2, Remnant From The Ashes, STALKER series, etc.)

Quick note: Arachnophobes should avoid this franchise. The spiders are huge, they are everywhere, and there are even moments where they literally crawl on your gas mask.

Classic game remade with a more modernized engine mostly as a way for nvidia to show off what their GPUs could do back then.

The lighting and post processing are amazing even by today's standards, but the animations are of course mostly pre-2010 standards still. Controls are still a bit jank and the storyline is pretty simple by modern standards, the chances of anyone getting the ""good"" ending are basically zilch without a guide but luckily the ""bad"" ending is canonical; yes you are a fated to be a huge fuckup.

Aims for an immersive experience and doesn't do a bad job of it, it's borderline an immersive sim.


As for must-know gameplay mechanics that the game never tells you:

Most importantly you can burn spiderwebs with your lighter (tap m by default). There's a point in the game where you're blocked by a spiderweb you can't just push through, and the game doesn't do ANYTHING to tell you how to get past.

Hold down the reload button to swap your assault rifle to pre-war military ammo. This ammo is treated as money, but the game is quick to move you past a point where there are any stores to buy stuff from. This ammo does a lot more damage than the regular stuff, late in the game it's likely to save your hide.",1693415570,1693415570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gunplay also offers a highly satisfying experience, complemented by an extensive array of weapons for players to choose from and dabble with.

I get a playable 15-30 fps with my Intel HD Graphics 4600 on 1080P Low and managed through it. And truly, most of the time you're in dark tunnels or with a gas mask, so high graphics may not be much better than low.
Weapons are pretty fun, I usually play with an AK-74M/Kalash or later an AK-2012/Kalash 2012 with reflex sight, laser designator, ext. mag(Kalash only) and suppressor, a shotgun (Shambler or later the machine-shotgun) and a revolver with stock&fore end, ext. barrel and 2x sight for sniping (you might want to swap for a Lolife in Last Light for higher mag capacity).
Only thing I want to complain about is the nightvision experience. When you have NVG on, there's a weird IR flashlight that you can't turn off. Not that it compromises your location, you know, it's IR, but it makes everything washed out and it's extremely difficult to see things beyond like 20 meters. That's not what I'm expecting from the ""redux"" version of a game!

Overall I'm pleased with the game tho, and here's some tips for newcomers:
1. Holding a particular key results in a different behavior from pressing it. Like when you have a gas mask on, pressing G wipes its visor, while holding G takes it off.
2. Don't forget to charge your flashlight and NVG! Hold the default lighter/charger button to bring up the universal charger and press LMB until the hand on the meter reaches peak.
3. You'll need to charge weapons that use compressed air or battery like the Tikhar, Hellbreath and Flamethrower or they won't fire. Hold down R and press LMB.
4. Those keys with a glowing red ribbon will open a locked safe in the same level, just pay attention to corners and places you might miss.",1678612013,1693277725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just weapons you can find/buy and customize a bit. The story wasn’t much and the ending-choice can be reloaded, but I was greatly intrigued by the lore unfolding mostly through random conversations you overhear or the things you see, during your travels. Played it on hardest difficulty (Hardcore Ranger) for 35 hours to explore everything. There are many areas that become unreachable once you progress the main path, so I had to replay some chapters. It also required a lot of stealth and crazy-careful ammunition and utility management, without any UI. Had to google a couple of keys, but the immersion was worth it. Also, I had to reload most fights for ammo conservation, but I still enjoyed them all. The game’s best points come from its great graphics, its beautifully dreadful and mostly claustrophobic environment designs and its natural animations and sound effects, which together create a constant feeling of danger, plus some very cinematic and satisfying shooting of hideous monsters.

However, even though this is a remaster, there are many critical unresolved technical issues like:
* The maximum in-game resolution is 1600x1200. This bug is related to having multiple displays connected. It can be fixed by using Special K's borderless windowed mode.
* Tesselation leads to missing geometry, such as holes in walls with the raw background being visible.

Fun little story: I bought the original Metro 2033 back in 2010 when it first released, but was only ever able to play a couple of hours into it before I had to stop playing, as back then I was on a crappy PC that couldn't really handle it. Now, over 10 years later, I can finally say I've beaten Metro 2033 after returning to play the redux version!

I've never read the Dimitri Glukhovsky novel on which this game is based, so I'm going to be judging Metro 2033 Redux purely on its own merits without any external reference point. The game puts you in the shoes of Artyom, a man living in a postapocalyptic Moscow where the remnants of humanity are forced to live in the tunnels of the old metro system, fending off attacks by mutant beasts that stalk the ruins. When his home station is threatened, Artyom sets out on a journey across the metro to find help, encountering plenty of interesting friends - and more than a few enemies, human and non-human. That's the basic premise of the story; I found it nice and engaging.

The graphics of this redux version of the game are fine, giving the metro a sufficiently dark, grimy aesthetic. Sound design is also on point, helping to bring everything to life. The gameplay is exactly what you'd expect of any first-person shooter, with a mix of options for running and gunning versus taking a more stealthy approach. There's a variety of weapons for you to get your teeth into, but you can only carry three different guns at a time - so you'll have to pick and choose which ones you want carefully.

Given this is a postapocalyptic setting, weapons can be divided into two broad categories. There are proper firearms left behind from the end of the world, such as AKs and the like; these are the guns you really want to get your hands on, as they're powerful. However, ammo for them tends to be more scarce (something exacerbated by the fact that in the metro, military-grade ammo serves as currency for buying equipment and upgrades, so you'll never want to use all of your military-grade ammo for fighting). Then there are the improvised firearms that the metro dwellers have crafted from whatever junk they have lying around; these tend to be weaker than proper military weapons and might have their own quirks (such as air-propelled weapons that require you to pressurise them by hand), but ammo for them is makeshift and therefore tends to be more plentiful. So part of the game is about balancing your ammo currency and the types of weapons you carry, figuring out what sort of upgrades to buy for them.

Other weapons and equipment you'll need: throwing knives and grenades always come in handy, and you'll always need to ensure you have plenty of filters for your gas mask. Your gas mask is vital - the surface of Moscow and more than a few of its metro tunnels are irradiated and thus will kill you if you venture out without protection. This is where exploration becomes vital to the gameplay; do not race through levels blindly. Take your time to explore every nook and cranny, as quite often you'll find goodies hidden everywhere - ammo, gas mask filters, even keys to safes crammed with lots of pickups. In short, the game rewards you for examining your surroundings!

Overall, the game isn't too long either - I beat it in roughly 10 hours or so, which I felt to be just the right length for the story it was telling. On the whole, therefore, I highly recommend Metro 2033 Redux!

A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age.

The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station-Cities struggle for survival, with each other, and the mutant horrors that await outside. You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised underground. Having never ventured beyond the city limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat. Your journey takes you from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands above, where your actions will determine the fate of mankind. But what if the real threat comes from within? Great and Awesome Game to play! Improved graphics and interesting story itself! The gunplay is on another level. From pumps to AK!

У 2013 році світ був спустошений апокаліптичною подією, яка знищила майже все людство та перетворила поверхню Землі на отруйну пустку. Жменька тих, хто вижив, сховалася в глибинах московського підпілля, і людська цивілізація вступила в новий темний вік.

Настав 2033 рік. Ціле покоління народилося та виросло під землею, а їхні міста-станції метро, ​​які знаходяться в облозі, борються за виживання одне з одним і жахливими мутантами, які чекають зовні. Ви Артем, народжений в останні дні перед пожежею, але виріс під землею. Ніколи не виходячи за межі міста, одна доленосна подія викликає відчайдушну місію в серце системи метро, ​​щоб попередити залишки людства про жахливу загрозу, що насувається. Ваша подорож перенесе вас із забутих катакомб під метро до безлюдних пусток угорі, де ваші дії визначатимуть долю людства. Але що, якщо справжня загроза йде зсередини? Чудова і приголомшлива гра! Покращена графіка і сама цікава історія! Перестрілка на іншому рівні. Від насосів до АК! Ви можете вибрати різні варіанти. Допомогти або відмовити і т. д. Оточення зруйнованої Москви, що може бути краще цього! Однозначно рекомендую перевірити цю гру, якщо ви ніколи не робили цього! Від наших українських друзів! Слава Україні!

Only spent a few hours on it, but I have zero interest to continue.

Being a Fallout fan and after hearing a lot about Metro, I finally gave it another try and loved it. I do not finish a lot of games, and having completed it at least once proves how much I loved it. The mechanics are great, and if you ignore the bugs (I only had it once or twice), it's perfect, except for the fact that you cannot reload a saved game and go back to change your decisions.

It's also interesting how it forces you to manage a pretty small inventory of three guns unlike other games that let you carry more weapons but have you micromanage your inventory. I was worried that I would run our of ammo or gas masks, but with my play-style (on Sparta mode), not being an expert gamer, especially after I had to leave my keyboard+mouse combo due to RSI, I could still survive till the end.

The game does get a little frustratingly difficult at times, especially for a story-based gamer like me, but it still sort of worked out with a little strategy.

[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
1. Realistic Combat
I was awed by the way the monsters moved in combat. The movements looked fluid compared to combat in Half Life, where the fight between characters were ""blockish"" or ""robotic"". E.g. The watchers attacking Bourbon and Artyom while moving to Riga Station.

2. Interactive Background
It is amazing to see the demons fly around in the background and see them swoop into the active zone. Compared to other games where the background is just an unending cinematic loop, this provides a sense of realism. E.g. The demons flying around Moscow.  

3. Moral Points
It is interesting to note that there are points that will affect your morals in this game. While they are not explicitly shown, it is a good point to note.

4. Traps
Holes in the ground, tripwires, hidden cans. All these traps make the game so much more exciting. 

5. Sneaking
There are some occasions where you can sneak by and avoid combat totally. This really gives the game variety. If you prefer to fight, you can fight.

6. Story
Some Cthulu-like parts included. Interesting. The dream modes don't really make sense but they are an interesting aspect.

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
1. Movement
Following characters around isn't smooth. E.g. Bourbon leaving Exhibition to use the tunnels. Bourbon will walk to a point and rotate about that point before continuing his walk.

2. Guns
Crappy simulation. For a country that makes tons of weapons, it is strange that their post-apocalyptic nightmare will have such rudimentary weapons like the Bastard. You would think that their technology would at least be in the 21st century, not Cold-War era.

3. Repetitive model
The adults look the same. In 2 different zones, the children scribble on the floor wearing the same clothes. Boring.

4. Lousy Tutorials
Tutorials do not teach you how to use the sticky grenade or the knife throw.

5. Confusing situations
The scenario in the hidden subway with the child ghost was retarded. Every other spider web in the game can be pushed through, yet this scenario requires you to turn on your lighter to burn the web. There are no hints to use fire and people are known to get stuck at this particular scenario.

6. The gas mask.
How does it change the game? The only difference is an annoying ""Press T to change the filter"" and minor cracks in your mask to simulate damage taken.",1434934046,1692374858,True,1,0,0.514680922031402588,0,True,False,False

The combat is repetitive and the stealth is half-baked. It's often not clear when enemies can see you and it's not usually worth it to avoid conflict anyway. Visually, it's not very impressive. The whole thing felt like a 7th gen console game rather than a PC game in the worst way. The story seems pretty interesting at first, but it really doesn't go anywhere, and it gets rather heavy-handed at parts. I cannot stress enough how bad the stealth is, and it's not like you can build your loadout around stealth either since there are many areas where you're forced to fight out in the open. I found this game to be very cryptic in its storytelling, and the ending left me confused. [spoiler]There is a true ending that can only be obtained by getting enough ""points"" throughout the game. This is never explained. The way you get these points is by either performing good deeds like donating a few shells to beggars or exploring hidden corners of the map and finding evidence of life before the apocalypse, which is sometimes accompanied by a flashback. (It is never explained how Artyom is able to see these.) The only indication that you have received one of these points is a sound cue and a white flash on your screen. It is not explained what the significance of collecting these points is, how many you have, how many you need to get the good ending, or even that collecting them yields a better ending than the default one.[/spoiler] I'm all for secrets in games but finding the secrets in this game did not feel rewarding.

[h1]Books[/h1]
If you've read the books, this is an incredibly shallow adaptation where everything is oversimplified into a shooting gallery. If you did not read the books, then you still get a story that's falling apart with instantly forgettable characters who all look and sound the same, with a very anti-climactic ending. You will find files to read that add to the context but it's a very out of place and outdated format to add more depth to a story they sort of failed to well represent. Artyom having inner mologues during some walking or crawling sections could've been better, perhaps.

[h1]Overall atmosphere[/h1]
What the game is incredibly good at is providing you with a unique atmosphere. It *is* beautiful in it's own, post-apocalyptic way, and there are some much welcome mechanics that modern games no longer use such as stealth where enemies are not blind-deaf, smartly placed wire traps I've last seen in Vietcong. This is very much a rail-FPS and pun aside that means there are no choices, and maybe only one or two levels have small optional routes for discovery. Checking corners is very rewarding, but in general you should not worry about ammo or ""money-ammo"" you'll have more than plenty enough in hard + survival on your first playthrough. 
[h1]Lenght[/h1]
The game is roughly 8-9 hours long, my playtime comes from starting and abandoning it twice in the past decade until I finally finished it now. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
One off from the bucket list, but honestly? I've been shooting at giant rats, giant monkeys, and giant gorillas - all the same ""it runs at you so you shoot it"" archetype of 0 creativity enemies, so the overall gameplay is quite boring when it comes to monsters, the best parts of the game are definitely the stealthy-firefights against hostile people. 

Is it worth it? Look, if you've not picked this up on one of the million Steam sales, Steam free gifts, Epic free gift, Fanatical / GMG / Humble bundles, you can pick this up for 4,99 anytime you want during any sale of any store. But to me, it was a little bit of a wasted time because as an FPS it's not too creative or exciting, as a METRO story you are way better off reading the books for an even better atmoshpere and far more depth. I think the developers chose the wrong format to adapt this story, it should've been a survival horror with action elements, instead it's a rail shooter action game with *some* horror / survival elements at certain points. Resident Evil 7 and 8 managed to do twice as much story and mystery with actually satisfying discovery of the story, from the fraction of the source material METRO devs had.",1691346973,1691346973,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3]Steam Deck Notes:[/h3]

Even though this game released a long time ago, it runs and looks like what at AAA game would for the Steam Deck. Besides the amazing animations, my favorite part is the forgiving aim assist. It makes the game so much more relaxing. 

My only complaint is that the load times do last about a minute per level. But each level lasts about 30 minutes. A small price to pay if you ask me.

[b] Overall [/b]: 7/10

Metro 2033 is all about a great post-apocalyptical story, spread across numerous chapters, and packed into a nice FPS. A definitive must do for any shooter lover who is looking for a great scenario.

[b] Gameplay [/b] : 7/10

The game tries to remain as realistic as possible while maintaining some fun. Therefore, the gunplay can feel a bit heavy at times and movements are not the smoothest I know. However, I loved the fact that we can choose between 2 game modes, one turned toward realism and one more arcady.

[b] Graphics [/b] : 7/10

A nice engine, nice FX. Very much acceptable for 2022 even.

[b] Story [/b] : 9/10

No spoilers but a great adventure set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow.

[b] Achievements [/b] : 9/10

All of the achievements are straightforward and can be grabbed along the story. 2 playthrough required. No Grinding.",1656933817,1691010879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Steam really needs to add a neutral rating. I can let slide:

- The childish anticommunism
- Terrible optimization
- Console port
- FOV
- Bad hitboxes, mediocre gunplay in general
- Bland economy system
- Underwhelming stealth
- Pointless mechanics like oxigen/battery charging
- Weak ending


But only because this game has a very immersive setting/atmosphere that will make it up for the faults. People say the writting is good but honestly it didn't click with me. The gimmicky mechanics and combat will overstay their welcome even though it is a relatively short game.

I played the original for 2 hours straight and couldn't get into it but decided to buy the Redux version a couple of years later to give it a fair shake. I still didn't like it so even more years later I am playing it again and sadly, I am still just not impressed.

The game feels janky. There is a slight microstutter that isn't consistently there. No frame dips though and the game does run smooth in terms of performance. The mouse doesn't suffer from the janky-ness though it does have an issue in which the horizontal sensitivity is significantly higher than the vertical. This cannot be adjusted independently.
Speaking of janky, the animations aren't smooth to me at all. This makes the creatures so difficult to shoot. Coupled with the fact that the character moves so ridiculously slow, the combat feels terribly unbalanced. It's like the game can't decide if it wants to be a fast paced action shooter like Doom or something slower and more methodical so they tried to pick a middle ground and got it all wrong. This will of course be subjective opinion.
The game supports 21:9 but the FOV is SICKENINGLY NARROW and cannot be adjusted in game.
The sound effects, which are one of the most important things to me in a game, are terrible. Guns sound like toys and all the other little things are weak sounding as well. I would say the poor sound effects are by far the most disappointing aspect.

They talk about being a survival horror game but to succeed at that I think they need to clean up the animations some and slow the creatures down as well as spawn in less of them then provide less ammo to balance it out. The hit boxes are off a bit too as I occasionally shoot one like 5 ft away and I see dust/snow kick up off the ground behind it but yet the creature seems unaffected.

I like the theme and setting plus the level design really is impressive when it comes down to the little details. However, the beauty of a game's visuals is never enough to save it, in my mind.

EDIT: one last thing I forgot to mention...there is no manual saving. No quicksaving either. Just stupid checkpoint autosaves.",1690757586,1690757677,False,1,0,0.495085328817367554,0,True,False,False

The only reason it took me around 10hrs to finish it was due to some faulty checkpoints and some exploration,speakin of which...

There were some instances where the game actually punished me for exploring and wouldnt let me just admire the enviroments,to the point i literally legged the hell out of two entire sections of the game in frustration and some glitches forced me to wander around wasting ammo and time which led me to look up gameplay videos only to realize the npcs didnt said their lines to let me know what was i supposed to do in a new section where theres literally no indication of what you are supposed to do unless you wander around getting swarmed by mutants and get lucky pressing the action button on 2 very specific spots.

The plot is okay and interesting at some points,it has some sort of supernatural element,sadly,it does nothing to expand it and ends up feeling lackluster by the end. 

The dynamic between the characters whenever you are in an squad is entertaining and decent enough.

The fire grenades are useless,somehow throwing 5 of them at a bunch of mutants clipping in to eachother is less effective than a couple of well placed handgun shots and i couldnt find a single instance on which i could rely on them which sucks,considering there are several parts where you get swarmed by enemies and its one of the resources you loot the most.

Constant crashes towards the last 3 hours of the game turned an otherwise good experience in to a frustrating rush to the next check point,managed to fix them but the damage to my experience was already done,so i am very glad i bought it dirt cheap during a sale,otherwise i would be furious.

I really wanted to love this game (the atmosphere,the enviroments,the setting and the characters are really good),but for everything it did right,there were atleast 2 or 3 frustrating things setting it back from being great,id argue it would have worked better as an interactive story game rather than a shooter.",1690627461,1690628041,False,0,0,0.46875,0,True,False,False

Most notably, the game feels like a classic FPS story. Great world, based on a book series. Systems that make you feel connected to the world and do not undermine your immersion, a common issue in modern games.

To be fair, it does have significantly better graphics and other quality of life improvements. But the cons outweigh the pros for me. It's a shame the classic Metro 2033 is so hard to find. It will rarely pop up on the Steam Store for free for a limited time, but other than that it's gone. However, if you really want to try this game, wait for this one to be on sale and give it a try.

This is such a great experience for a 10-year old game. It's a short but very fun game and the setting is surprisingly very unique from other post-apocalyptic worlds in gaming. A bit mediocre gameplay and story-wise due to its age but I still had a blast playing it.

Story: The story is pretty basic and nothing special even from the previous decades' standards. It's just the typical story where the main character is trying to fight the horrors of the apocalypse and possibly saving the world. I won't deny, it actually gets pretty bland in the latter half and the last 2 chapters before the last one bored me quite a bit. There are also moments in the game that seemed too convenient for the player to just run into or discover.

Gameplay: The gameplay is also your average 2000s FPS with short and easy platforming and little to nothing puzzle solving. However, the small details in the gameplay is what makes it so special, like pumping your pneumatic guns, charging your flashlight manually, looting bombs from disabled traps, even wiping your gas mask and many more. These simple things really brings out the post-apocalyptic vibe and adds a sense of realism and scarcity in resources. I also love the iron sights on this game as it felt accurate compared to other games from its era where the iron sights are total garbage. Aside from gun combat you can also opt to kill enemies stealthily although I do not recommend this because the stealth in this game is very very clunky.

Sound & Visuals: The graphics are all right, they are nothing new, nothing special. Although, I appreciate that they revamped most of the major character's faces so that you can distinguish them more properly now compared to the original. The guns' design and customization are amazing, you can really see that the developers tried their best to fit the look of these guns in the post-apocalyptic setting. The ambiance also is amazing, its has that constant eerie, unsettling and dangerous vibe in it that you seemingly cannot escape even in safe areas. On the other hand, the voice acting is very bad, it seemed just like the minimal effort from most of the main characters while the children NPCs are downright cringe-inducing. It also did not help that the main character had a non-speaking role which breaks the immersion.

Enjoyment: Although a lot of bad things can be said about this game, it is still actually pretty enjoyable even in today's standards. As long as you can put up with the mediocrity of the other aspects of the game the immersion will carry it for you.",1690292736,1690292736,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a section in the game where you are put on a ""Onrails"" shooting section that is possibly the most difficult thing in the entire series. I'm not even joking. It is around halfway in and I won't be going into spoilers but it is something that ruined my game for around a day.

There is a bug where the enemies won't spawn at one section, which somehow makes you vehicle instantly die when taking any form of damage at the next part of the level. Which is an absolute pain in the ass. No matter what happens, you will always die. Even if every enemy is killed.

To pass this part, exit to the main menu and restart the entire level. If it happens again, restart it again. And this is on the easiest difficulty of Normal. I haven't tried it on the harder difficulties.",1689132902,1689857457,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Visually, the shadows could use some work, so maybe set your gamma a bit higher than what's recommended, if your eyes strain from the darkness. The story is probably my favorite part. You walk in and out of many distinct characters lives, getting a good incomplete picture of all the major sites from whats left of civilization. 

     Wish some areas were more interactive. The outside scenes of action were, while when you arrive at a new station they are mostly a pretty sight with places to stock up on ammo and medicine. Sometimes I get the feeling I'm an outsider watching a long cinematic rather than playing as Artyom. 

     And why make him the silent type? It works in Half-Life because you spend it mostly alone, but here you get repeated questions and directives, awaiting a response, followed by an awkward silence, all because the only narration you offer must oddly be kept to reading aloud from your diary at the end of a chapter. Also, typos and bad grammar in them. And while I'm complaining: locking a ""good"" ending behind collectables is always a bad decision. It makes the surreal sequences and warnings from Khan feel like a buildup to nothing. I get that it's incentive to replay, but for such a short scene I could just look it up instead of tediously collecting notes and whatever else. The game is a bit buggy, as it froze once, and apparently more often for others. The physics of the game engine is wonky. If you've played a Source Engine game and ever tried moving an object against wall, then see as it proceeds to have a breakdown, you'll get what I mean. And the NPC kids live in uncanny valley territory. 

    Still, the majority of the story remains atmospheric with memorable characters. More common than those sore spots of melodrama are sequences where the story finds life in homespun stoicisms. Khan is my favorite, as his presence brought an otherwordliness the dream sequences could not. The environmental storytelling is on par with other good post-apocalyptic entries. The world is starkly, even disgustingly beautiful. Crawling out of the dark to see a cloudy sky eventually fills you with both relief and dread. Those scenes of terror from holding off mutants with, becoming a one-man-army in the process, are so much fun. I could sense every step, every bullet taken. Whether alone or with NPCs, yelling into dark, the experience is always a roller coaster. First impressions of this are pretty positive.

Starting with the game play itself, Metro is not overly complex however elements of tracking heals and gas mask filters is vital especially in the harder difficulties. The atmosphere in the world is unreal, so many times i would catch myself fully immersed only to be taken out by getting scared. While not being predominantly a horror the elements of horror really shine thanks to the atmosphere players find themselves in. While playing this game i felt as though the plot was rather consistent with very little blunders in it, even the notes found help deepen the understanding of this apocalyptic world and its horrors on the surface.

My only real flaw with this game was the gun play, by no means being bad the variety was very minimal while making sense for the setting the subsequent games have more variety while only being set a year ahead of 2033. I found myself only really using two guns and while stealth was often encouraged many places it felt very unreliable whether its against creatures on the surface or humans underground. But by no means does this ruin the game it is just one aspect and the only one i disliked.

Overall, this is the best story game i have played in years. Having me on the edge of my seat so often, its world building allowed me to place myself in the Metro world and really enjoy what the game has to offer.

Set in a post-apocalyptic Russia after a nuclear strike by the West, it follows Artyom's journey through the Russian metro system to warn other stations of an incoming attack by some strange forces.

The game is pretty linear, meaning you have to go from point A to point B to advance to the next level and so on, it does have some markets in some stations to buy or trade for weapons, bullets, medkits, filters, etc.

Overall I recommend it, the game holds up pretty well by today's standards and the story will keep you entertained for a while. It has a very dark atmosphere and it's very immersive too. It also features 2 endings which is nice and gives some replayability.

Bad: This is one of those games that try to be 'realistic' with its game mechanics. Your character has bad aim unless you upgrade your weapons. The monsters have wonky hitboxes. Combine the two and you get a fun time. It also has a very annoying mechanic: the gas masks. Sometimes you have to go into places with bad air and you need to put on a gas mask. They use filters that you have to scavenge for or buy. This feels like being rushed and you just can't explore...

This game has like 2 game modes and 2 difficulty levels or something which change the experience; I forget what they do and don't care.

I was recommended this game because I enjoyed S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The person who told me about said it was ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but better."" And I didn't believe them at first because a bit of clunky aiming and getting used to the controls on my part. But once I got into it, I couldn't stop. 

""Animal"" Enemies where a pain in my ass- as they should me. The surface is clear for a reason. And Killing every Nazi and general stain on my boot human enemy in my wake was satisfying when I got used to the controls. 

I played it on baby mode because I wanted to engage with the story and it didn't disappoint.  If you want a good story on Human hopelessness and a bit of civil unrest, I would pick this up. It's about 10 Hours if you play from start to finish on baby mode. 

-My only complaint was sometimes I got backed into a corner because an enemy pushed me there because it was having a hard time tracking and i was mauled to death on more than one occasion.

Pro:
- Great Story/Characters
- Great Visuals
-Great Voice Acting and really cool we can also toggle Russian Voice Acting with subtitles
- Makes every resource matter and makes it rewarding to search every nook, space, body  for valuable resources.

Cons:
- Lackluster/barely any weapon customization/upgrades
- Weapons felt like they did  terrible damage like enemies still living after several headshots with a shotgun or ak.
- Enemies have too much health. 
- Only has autosave and no option to save progress manually

Based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novel, this game is a remarkable survival horror experience that immerses you in a world where humanity clings to existence amidst mutated creatures and political turmoil.

The atmosphere in Metro 2033 Redux is nothing short of captivating. The dimly lit tunnels, dripping with suspense and tension, create an oppressive and claustrophobic ambiance. The attention to detail in the environmental design, from graffiti-covered walls to dilapidated stations, adds to the immersion and paints a vivid picture of a world ravaged by a nuclear catastrophe.

The storytelling in Metro 2033 Redux is masterful. The narrative unfolds through the eyes of Artyom, a young survivor tasked with navigating the hostile Metro and its factions. The richly developed characters, coupled with the exploration of moral choices and the exploration of the human condition, create a thought-provoking and emotionally engaging experience.

Gameplay-wise, Metro 2033 Redux strikes a balance between intense combat and stealth. Ammunition is scarce, encouraging resourceful approaches and well-timed stealth takedowns. The array of weapons and attachments allows for customization and adaptation to different combat situations. However, it's important to note that the game truly shines in its ability to make you feel vulnerable and in constant danger.

The Redux version of Metro 2033 brings improved graphics and enhanced gameplay mechanics, further immersing you in the haunting atmosphere of the Moscow Metro. The updated visuals make the world come alive with increased detail and atmospheric lighting effects. Combined with the exceptional sound design, the game delivers an audio-visual experience that heightens the tension and makes every encounter pulse-pounding.

In conclusion, Metro 2033 Redux is a gripping and atmospheric journey through the depths of the Metro. With its immersive storytelling, oppressive atmosphere, and a perfect blend of combat and stealth mechanics, it stands as a testament to the power of narrative-driven survival horror. If you crave a post-apocalyptic experience that challenges both your skills and your conscience, Metro 2033 Redux is a must-play.",1688488055,1688488055,True,12,0,0.642252266407012939,0,True,False,False

My only one gripe with the game, however, is with the ending sequence:[spoiler]Why end an fps survival game with a really empty and pointless parkour run? It's so out of place for the game and just feels so rushed. [/spoiler] Other than that? It's a fantastic game overall.

500 gram tavuk göğüs eti
2 su bardağı pirinç
1 çay bardağı şehriye
3 yemek kaşığı tereyağı
1 su bardağı tavuk suyu
2 su bardağı kaynamış su
1 tatlı kaşığı tuz
1/2 (yarım) tatlı kaşığı karabiber

Tavuklu Pilav Tarifi Nasıl Yapılır?

İlk olarak tavuklarımızı haşlamak için tencereye koyuyoruz ve üzerini bir parmak geçecek şekilde su ekleyerek kaynamaya bırakıyoruz.
Haşlanan tavuklarımızı soğuması için kenara alıyoruz.
Biraz soğuduğunda tavuklarımızı tiftikliyeceğiz.
Bu sırada pirinçlerimizi de ılık suya koyup nişastasının çıkmasını bekliyoruz.
Pilav tenceresine yağımızı ekleyip eridiğinde şehriyelerimizi kavuruyoruz.
Şehriyelerin rengi değişip, kokusu çıktığında pirinçlerimizi de ekliyoruz ve 5-10 dakika kadar daha kavuruyoruz.
Daha sonra pirinçimizin üzerine tiftiklediğimiz tavuğumuzu ekliyoruz.
1 bardak tavuk suyu ve 2 bardak kaynamış suyunu da ekledikten sonra tuz ve karabiberi de ilave edip bir kere karıştırıyoruz ve kapağını kapatarak kısık ateşte pişmeye bırakıyoruz. Ben pilav pişirirken çok fazla karıştırmıyorum size de böyle tavsiye ederim.
Pilavımız suyunu çekip tane tane olduğunda altını kapatıp, kapağın üzerine demlenmesi için kağıt havlu koyuyoruz. Servis yaparken havluyu alarak afiyetle pilavımızı yiyoruz. Ellerinize sağlık.

I recently got to play the redux version for the first time. I can’t really tell which content was directly taken over from last light (or the redux which I didn’t play) as I don’t have that many memories with that game as I played only the original a couple of times. Original review [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lord_Sithaniel/recommended/43110/] here [/url]


[u]Gameplay[/u]
I think the biggest and best change was the economy. If you play on survival mode on the highest difficulty, you don’t have tons of money anymore to spare due to you not directly getting a super expensive weapon 1/3 through the game which you can use throughout the rest of the game or sell for lots of bullets. The whole weapon evolution is done in a way much proper manner, meaning you can find or buy better versions of existing weapons slowly throughout the game, forcing you to use different types of weapons.  Also you can buy attachments for weapons on your own.

Additionally, you aren’t required to have a revolver, and can sell weapons and just go with whatever you find. I don’t like that the grenade and knife aren’t equipable items anymore, takes off a bit of the realism but gameplay wise they are way much more useful now, so I give it a pass.

Gameplay is still the same, although the maps that have optional stealth sequences are now way much better suited for that playstyle, making more logical map layouts trough very small changes. I like this a lot, especially that you can now knock out or right out kill people in melee combat in a silent way. For some reason the non-lethal method is faster than the lethal one making it rather useless to use.

Also new weapons are added which as mentioned slowly upgrade your gear but also keep the homemade weapon fashion. My highlight was a revolving shotgun made with a bike saddle as a shoulder stock. Great stuff!

On a side note, I’m not really sure but I feel the game is way much more difficult. Gun handling changed slightly but on both spartan and survivor modes more enemies appeared, or they took much more of a beating. Welcome change as I found the base game too easy, even on max difficulty combat encounters aren’t that much of a challenge.

[u]Sound[/u]
There are new musical pieces who I really really like. Most noticeable during the loading screens, but some environmental ones changed too, I really like that, giving me something new and fresh while still fitting to the tone of the game.

[u]Graphics[/u]
General improvement in every aspect, albeit I didn’t overanalyse any changes or anything. It just looks in general much better, additionally gasmasks have now actual huge visual impact. You can even clean it if it goes dirty via blood mostly but its fading away eventually on its own and the visual hinderance is not that big.

The only negative thing I have to say is the reload animation for the old weapons. It’s weird, for the spartan mode these are sped up, and for survivor slowed down. But some are apparently animated for the sped-up version first and then slowed down and for some its vice versa making some odd looking/feeling reloading animations. And even then, the base weapons from the original had better ones, having way much more weight behind the gun, especially when Artyom is slamming the magazine inside or onto the gun.

Also i personally liked the old hud way much more, this one is clearly more tendered towards a console audience. There is also a bug i didnt had in the previous version, when i hit ESC to open the menu/pause the game, my mouse often gets stuck at one corner of the screen, probably due to my second screen.

Big warning tough, the game has terrible performance if you turn SSAA. I have a 3060(laptop) and AMD Ryzen 5600h and 16GB Ram. If i put everything on max, and SSAA off i have 144+ FPS with SSAA 4x 32 FPS+-. No idea what they did wrong, isnt SSAA supposed to be better FPS wise than MSAA? Anyways if someone has problems just lower the SSAA as they did something wrong there.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
Really successful remake of a game I liked. Everything except the tedious trailing missions are now improved, from gun upgrades to better suited reworks of stealth focused maps or general upgrades of the graphical aspects of this game.  While some aspects i personally prefered from the older games, i solely dislike that they dont give you the decision anymore which edition to play, as i really like playing both and seeing the differences.

Great fps where the redux improves some combat aspects and a lot of visuals.

(Played on Ranger Survival Diff, well... tried to play as in original)

Tried to play this game on controller with a gyro enabled and welp... you can't You either have to play it on keyboard + mouse or simply don't play it at all.

Enemies are... something. In original game I didn't like how literally the same looking mutants are called differently. Nosalies, watchers, pugs, pegions. Only thing that was different color gradient, from more brighter to pitch black textures. Here enemies do visually differ, but they totally broke their behavior. Now all their unscripted animations are extremely twitchy and their models flies everywhere. Looks like Get Down - Geddan, legit. You're done if you couldn't manage to kill mutants in their scripted appear / scene animation, be cause when ""Geddan"" by ""Get Down"" starts right after it, they'll shorten the distance between you and them in a brief moment and will shake your screen so gawd damn hard you won't feel ur left leg, making shootin near imposible (damage is not that big even on Ranger diff, feels too weak after playing games like STALKER Anomaly, Gamma and Misery).

Yea, it's not that big of a deal when you got mass damage dealing weapons, high damage & rate of fire ARs and SMGs and shottys. Again - ""when you got"" them. At the very beggining of the game when you're about to enter Riga Station if I remember it right, you'll have shootout with mutants and you CLEARLY can see that their animation is not supposed to be like that when machine gun from the other side starts to shoot them. Their models just go haywire.

Stealth is even more broken than in original. You might be at the very start of the level and enemies on the other end of the map are somehow already aware of your presence, that's how it feels...

TL;DR

Visuals - Better than original.
Gameplay - Significantly worse than original.

First game of the Metro Series and although the game is a bit short, and is turning 10 years old next year, I still recommend this for a play through.  It is a FPS but is quite slow and atmospheric.  It's not the typical FPS which is full of action.  There's quite a limited variety of guns and enemies and generic story.  I am not a fan of the last stage which is a trial and error without much action, but I appreciate them trying to mix up the game play.  It's sort of like a survival horror at times, and maybe when it was first released, it had more impact.  Still, I treat this as an introduction to the series and it made me excited to play the next 2 installments so good job on giving a nice first game to the series.",1687125565,1687125565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But this game SEVERELY lacks enemy variety. At the point where I quit playing about 7 and a half hours in, there's been only about 4 non-human enemies up to that point with only one type dominating most of the encounters. 

The gameplay is really just a drag-and-drop first-person shooter. No bells and whistles added just point and click. Which is too bad because the game seriously could use something extra to not end up boring me to tears. The game also often utilizes respawning enemies with you being required to grab a certain item to progress. I found that really annoying and disappointing. If you like that type of gameplay though then perhaps this is for you. But I just can't recommend a game that bored me and doesn't have much unique outside of the world. Not to mention there is an atrocious on-rails shooting section which just keeps going.

I originally had the game on Xbox and absolutely loved it - the environments, gunplay and graphics were fantastic and I played through multiple times.

I didn't buy Redux when it initially came out, but when I saw it on sale recently I had the urge to play through it again so I picked it up on the cheap. Seeing it with updated graphics made me fall in love with it all over again - the Redux version is fantastic and for anyone who loves atmospheric games, shooters, stealth or even survival horror games should definitely pick this up too.

If you're new to this, I'd recommend playing on Spartan mode to ease yourself into it and then after your first playthrough you have to play on Ranger Hardcore (survival). It basically turns the game into an extremely challenging survival horror experience which is incredibly satisfying to complete. Also, for added atmosphere, keep your brightness low and play with Russian language enabled with English subtitles.

The only negatives I can say is that I did experience a couple of random CTDs for seemingly no reason and often background chatter subtitles don't actually appear which means you can miss some tidbits of information. This isn't a huge issue, but if like me you enjoy playing it in Russian with English subtitles for that added immersion then you can miss some dialogue.

I've been a FPS fan since I played Far Cry 3. I heard a lot about the [b]Metro[/b] franchise. The story developed brilliantly throughout the whole franchise. I'll point out some of the things that I liked most...

[+] Voice Acting was good as for the NPCs

[+] Graphical Details were top notch

[+] Gun Mechanism & Gunfire sound was satisfying

[+] No pointless quests

[+] Lighting of the Environment was truly mind-blowing!

[+] None of the weapon felt overpowered & there were quite a variety of them

[+] Loots & Resources were well balanced

[+] No noticeable problem with graphics optimisation

[+] Animation physics were excellent.. like pulling off the gas mask, opening doors etc

[+] Story was engaging & made sense


[-] Will [b]Artyom[/b] ever talk?

[-] No real guideline often puzzled the path

but not gonna lie to you lot but this game sucks balls
Graphics are beautiful, setting is amazing, story is pretty easy to catch on (and actually good), but the gameplay is ass 
There are like three choices throughout the game where basically A do good or B do bad
the other choice being that you dont kill people. Killing people earns like a bad karma each people so if you play the whole game without killing people youre bound to get a good ending. which is shite. 
Like I mentioned in my steam bio, I am a coward when it comes to games, so I always pick the easiest difficulty. And in that note I dont have any problems with saving or managing any bullets as I can find them easily through scouring the dead bodies. This aspect is very fun though i'll tell you what.
At least the bad ending is canon, which means that im content enough with my decisions (mind you all the possible choices except killing i chose the good guy desicions because i am a very nice person)

The game successfully captures the essence of the source material, offering a gripping plot, atmospheric environments, and detailed gameplay mechanics.

However, a notable drawback of the game is its fast-paced gameplay, which can detract from fully understanding and appreciating the world and its events. The protagonist is constantly pushed to complete tasks quickly, making it difficult to take in the intricacies of the environment. This rushed gameplay undermines the sense of immersion and discovery that could have been achieved.

Furthermore, Metro 2033 Redux lacks a comprehensive narrative that delves into the backstory of the world and its characters. While the plot is engaging, there is a missed opportunity to provide deeper context and a more fleshed-out exploration of the game's universe. Additionally, the predefined levels often offer only one way to progress, limiting the player's freedom and sometimes leading to unclear paths.

Another aspect that could have been improved is the absence of in-game tutorials. Many important mechanics and features must be discovered by the player themselves, which can be frustrating and hinder the overall experience.

To start, visual fidelity. It's a mixed bag, mostly due to the game's age. Animations are stiff and wonky, some effects (like flies buzzing on your gasmask) are not very well done, and there can be some clipping issues. However, this all pales in comparison to the actual textures, models, and environments. The game is a gorgeous look even all these years later. Everything looks dreary, dilapidated, and grungy. The monsters are horrific mutants, the tunnels feel abandoned and desolate, it's just an extremely well executed visual style.

Audio design is top notch as well, bar the voice acting. Guns range from sounding like they were made with shoddily crafted parts (a good thing in this case) to sounding like real powerhouses. Monsters sound fierce, and each has an extremely distinct audio design as well which is much appreciated. Voice Acting is a bit meh though. Very few actual voice actors worked on the game (14 in Total) with each of them not really putting much effort into making every character sound unique or interesting, which is annoying given the sheer volume of dialogue you'll hear. Hell, half the characters are Yuri Lowenthal doing one of the most lazy Russian accents I've heard, and I don't dislike the guy.

For the story, you'll hate me for this. [b]The book did it better.[/b] With that out of the way, the story isn't bad but it has some caveats. You're a wanna be Ranger who gets given a mission to save your underground station home from a new threat in the metro tunnels of a post apocalypse Moscow. It has plenty of action, plenty of horror, and a bit of intrigue. The problems I have with it is that you don't really get attached to characters, and that the ending is abrupt. I won't delve into why for the sake of spoilers, but just know it's not as character driven as you might like.

Gameplay is varied, with there being two modes. Spartan and Survival. Spartan mode offers a more relaxed experience with more ammo, resources and a faster movement speed. Survival is the opposite, with fewer bullets, resources and a slower movement speed. I personally believe Survival is the better experience, as it makes every action count far more. Aside from the obvious of shoot enemies and move forward in the levels, as the game is linear, there are other mechanics that help the game feel unique and interesting. When on the surface or in poison fog, you'll need to both wear a gas mask and change it's filters. Stealth is entirely optional but allows the saving of resources for when you need them most. Cobwebs blocking your sight can be burned, and oil lamps can be short to set environments on fire. Gunplay is a little dated, but certainly not terrible. The only bad part is the excessive flinching when you are damaged, your character's camera will jump a foot up each time and it can get annoying.

Put all this together and you have a game that, while a bit dated, provides a unique FPS experience compared to other games in the genre. It's a great first game for the Metro series, and I'm glad it didn't end up forgotten by the world like Singularity or TimeShift.",1685221328,1685236348,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are stunning, sound design is quite good and music is impeccable. The environments feel so realistically horrifying and help with delivering the main messages and themes of the game to the player.

Throughout the entire game I only had 2 problems: the English voice acting is a bit goofy (I just switched to Russian Voice, English Subtitles) and the alternate ending is annoying to get: you have to make all the good decisions, listen to some conversations, play the game stealthily against humans (because apparently fighting back at extremist soldiers is bad) alongside other miscellaneous objectives. All of which is never explained to the player and they barely even know if they progressed in the morality system or not. Not only that, this doesn't even give the canon ending! Even though I engaged in most fights stealthily and made every good moral decision I came across, I didn't get this alternate ending so I ended up just watching a video on it instead of replaying the game with the wiki open to engage with this bullshit system.

While it offers a dark and atmospheric world, it ultimately disappoints with its technical issues, lackluster gameplay mechanics, and missed opportunities for innovation.

One of the main drawbacks of Metro 2033 Redux is its inconsistent technical performance. Despite the visual enhancements, the game suffers from frequent frame rate drops, occasional glitches, and unresponsive controls. These issues detract from the immersive experience and can frustrate players, hindering their ability to fully engage with the narrative.

While the original Metro 2033 was known for its immersive storytelling, the Redux edition fails to capitalize on this aspect. The narrative feels disjointed at times, lacking the cohesion and emotional depth that made the original so compelling. Character development is underwhelming, with many individuals feeling one-dimensional and lacking meaningful interactions. As a result, it becomes challenging to form a genuine connection with the game's world and its inhabitants.

The gameplay in Metro 2033 Redux also leaves much to be desired. While the core mechanics remain intact, they feel dated and uninspired compared to modern first-person shooters. The combat encounters often devolve into repetitive shootouts, with limited variation in enemy encounters and tactics. Stealth mechanics, while present, feel underutilized and lack the depth and nuance seen in other stealth-focused games.

Another missed opportunity in Metro 2033 Redux is the lack of significant innovation or improvements beyond the visual upgrade. While the enhanced graphics are commendable, they alone cannot salvage a game that fails to deliver fresh ideas or meaningful gameplay enhancements. The Redux edition feels like a missed chance to introduce new mechanics, refine existing systems, or address long-standing player feedback.

Furthermore, the additional content included in Redux, such as the Ranger Mode, feels more like an afterthought than a substantial addition. While it does increase the game's difficulty, the lack of proper balancing and the absence of other noteworthy additions dampen its impact.

In conclusion, Metro 2033 Redux falls short of its potential as a remastered edition. Despite its atmospheric setting and the allure of the post-apocalyptic world, the game is marred by technical issues, underwhelming storytelling, and lackluster gameplay mechanics. While fans of the original may find some enjoyment in revisiting the Metro universe, newcomers may be left unimpressed by its outdated design and missed opportunities for innovation. Ultimately, Metro 2033 Redux fails to capture the essence of what made its predecessor a standout title in the genre.",1685119910,1685140805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had just played S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl, and this game took all of that and raised it up dramatically into a visually stunning narrative.  It was truly immersed from the first moment until the last.

Now in 2023, I bought it in a package with the sequels (which I haven't played yet!) and just played through a good amount of it last night on Steam Deck.  Not only does it play perfectly on Deck, but it brought me right back to the same mental place I was in 2010.  I don't think hardcore or survival was an option the first time I played, and it definitely makes the horror of the experience that much more intense.  I can only survive a few hits and ammo is scarce, so I'm finding myself bypassing many more enemies instead of engaging, which absolutely adds to the immersion.

From the moment you start playing, you are immediately immersed in the world. The attention to detail in the setting is amazing, and captures the beauty of the destruction of civilisation. Every flickering light, crumbling ruins and lurking shadows add to the tension and create an amazing experience.

Based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novel of the same name, the story follows Artyom's quest to travel underground to save his people from an impending threat. The great story combined with characters you meet along the way, add to the depth and emotional weight of the overall experience. The game amazingly ties in considerations, personal struggles and emotional questions to make you feel more than just an ordinary shooter. 

In terms of gameplay, Metro excels in offering different styles of approach. Resources are scarce, which forces you to shoot carefully and to count your shots, it also heavily encourages you to scrounge for supplies such as ammo, filters and other essentials. The game rewards you and encourages you to use the shadows and stealth to your advantage to eliminate enemies. However when the fighting kicks up, the game becomes a stressful and adrenaline pumping experience, with a total of 10 weapons at your disposal and with a variety of customisation such as sights, lasers and silencers.

In addition to all that, the Redux version includes ""Ranger mode"", which is a fantastic option for those looking for more challenges and realism.

Metro 2033 Redux is an unforgettable post apocalyptic world, with a captivating narrative, beautiful setting and amazing gameplay, and it is a testament to the power of story telling which games these days are so lacking of. Whether you're a fan of shooters or just want an engaging immersive experience, Metro 2033 is a game that will leave you in awe.",1684840222,1684840821,True,5,0,0.601964354515075684,0,True,False,False

I love everything about the gameplay except the janky gunplay, you do get used to it however.
The game's atmosphere and world/weapon/monster design are top notch.

The english dub is very bad but I can't recommend playing with russian dub because not all dialogue has subtitles.

The story and characters are pretty forgettable but never uninteresting to the point where it invokes boredom. The game felt very polished except for two game breaking bugs one of which required restarting the game several times and help from google to fix.

Not just for the graphics (though they do look spectacular, even compared to the original version) but for the many minor improvements to the gameplay experience.

The first game is based on a novel with the same name - which I also highly recommend reading. Although the novel is more complex and many of the events and characters go differently, the core story is the same. The setting is based on a future post-apocalyptic Russia in the aftermath of a nuclear war (here's to still hoping this increasingly believable scenario never turns into reality). The games and novels are set within Moscow in particular, where the survivors dwell within the Metro stations and over time formed multiple communities and factions, and are often at conflict with one another and face political struggles. Some are neutral, some are capitalist, some are fascist, and some even communist. However, mankind's inability to unite and make peace is just part of the problem as the city's outdoors are drenched with radiation and both, the city and the Metro alike are full of dangerous mutants. Suffice to see, the world is as grim as it can get. There is something disturbing about the fact that some kids are born without ever having seen Earth's sky. The story follows Artyom, one of many Metro dwellers being tasked by a Ranger to assist with an upcoming threat involving ""Dark Ones"" - a group of mysterious mutants that are almost impossible to kill, and ""appear"" to be threatening what remains of humanity's existence.

The game has a fantastic setting and plot that truly grips you. Though the journey is linear, the game does have a moral point system that adds up depending on some choices you make along the way (e.g. choosing stealth over combat, sparing lives etc) and how much of your environment you are willing to explore and scavenge. If enough points are gained, then it is possible to experience 2 possible endings (though only one is canon). There are some truly inventive weapons along the way that Artyom can add to his arsenal, assuming the player is willing check various corners and barter/trade when able. In the Metro's world, bullets are the currency, not cash money. Thus it is important to both scavenge and conserve as much ammo as possible if you want to obtain some very cool weaponry. The player will experience many different scenarios along the way, from sneaking past (or fighting) Reds and Nazis in the tunnels to facing the terrifying librarians in the archives on Moscow's surface. 4A Games nailed many things, but nothing did they nail better than the incredibly dense and dark atmosphere - I can never forget the sequence walking with Khan past the ghosts.

So how does the Redux version fare compared to the original aside from graphics? Well, it is the same game for the most part. However, character models are different, and the gameplay is much more polished. The vanilla Metro 2033 suffered from broken stealth segments where it was not only difficult to avoid getting spotted, but also to stealth kill without raising the alarm. Thus combat was often inevitable if you didn't want to reload checkpoints multiple times. Redux fixes all that with much smoother stealth mechanics: you know more or less when you are visible or not, and you can either knock out or stealth-kill enemies without unexpectedly alerting the whole garrison. This time you have a genuine choice in how to approach situations, and that's all from just a bit of much-needed polish. Thank you for that!

I definitely recommend the series as a whole, but it's imperative that you start with this one. Metro 2033 is a great start to a deeply emotional trilogy, and in my opinion it nails the gloomy atmosphere the best. The fact that this Redux improves the whole experience is a welcome bonus.

I love this series. I obviously started with this game and immediately moved over to Last Light and Exodus and I must say, this has been one of the most fun and rewarding series of games I've ever played. This series is a must-play in my book for anyone who enjoys single-player games. 

Onto this game specifically, it is a true classic. The story is fantastic and is enthralling from the first mission to the very last. I decided to play a very normal way with the average difficulty and the easier play style instead of a harder difficulty and Spartan Mode, which I will be playing soon as I plan to replay the series again on the harder mode. The gun-play is also a standout feature, that melds together incredibly with the economy of the game. Another part of the game that made it so unique is both the setting and the enemies. The way the game keeps the underground levels fresh and interesting is wonderful considering how many studios of their size would usually use the same assets everywhere making the environment feel too familiar, they also do a great job of including things outside of the Metro to really spice things up. The monsters are also very different and interesting. The inclusion of some decent AI pathing and interactions with the environment, along with the variety of different monsters that really test your skills makes this game (and series) stand out.

Overall, I'll give this game a solid 9/10.",1633811221,1684602599,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Metro doesn't need an open world. 

In Exodus, filled with bugs, you can explore an ""open"" world in which there are three or four enemy bases per level, for clearing which you get four bullets and one first-aid kit, even though you have spent half of your ammo. 

This game carefully tells you the story. And because of its linearity, it has no bugs.

Metro 2033 Redux is a gripping game that immerses players in the dark depths of a post-apocalyptic Moscow! As a fan of atmospheric shooters, I found myself enthralled by the game's rich storytelling, tense gameplay, and chilling atmosphere.

The gameplay seeks a balance between stealth and furious first-person shooting combat. Players must explore hazardous environments while using stealth to eliminate enemies quietly or engage in heart-pounding firefights with a variety of weaponry. The scarcity of resources and ammo adds suspense and strategy to the game, forcing players to think carefully before engaging in combat. The survival mechanics, such as managing gas mask filters and using a hand-cranked torch, add to the immersion and difficulty of the game.

One of the game's strongest points is its attention to detail and world-building. The Metro is its own society, full with unique personalities and factions, each with its own set of objectives and beliefs. Conversations with these characters and observing their hardships bring depth and nuance to the story, making the world feel alive.

The Metro 2033 is an absolute must-play for fans of atmospheric and story-driven shooters. Its dark and immersive atmosphere, captivating narrative, stressful gameplay, and dedication to detail combine to create a remarkable post-apocalyptic journey.

[TL;DR]

The graphics are beautiful and the atmosphere is nicely made. Good so far.
The rest is one massive meh.

[Plot]

By most part it is a conceptual ripoff of Fallout series morphed into FPS. Post-apocalyptic world, travel between stations which are full of demoralised people fallen into decadence. Interesting idea, but not particularly developed into anything more, thus monotonous. Gets boring quickly. The game is supposed to have some humour, but it is all just ancient Russian memes. You need to be Russian to find them funny.

[Graphics]

Pretty nice. Pretty, great ambience and colours.

[Gameplay]

There's probably an audience for this kind of games. It is not a traditional FPS, the whole gameplay revolves around walking around without any danger only to enter the dangerous zone where you have to fight the mandatory monster. Not just this grind is insane, boring and requires a huge investment of time and precise calculation, it feels dated and, again monotonous.

What else? Skip, not worth it. Unless you like grind for grind's sake.",1684243202,1684243202,False,0,0,0.400000005960464478,0,True,False,False

3:)  the demons can some times glitch and grab u out of nowhere and if u play on the hardest difficulty it will kill you instantly but the game has good checkpoints

虽说小说没有看全，但三部游戏是一点没落下。比较感慨的就是在相同的世界观下阿尔乔姆的命运完全不一样啊！
游戏里他有信赖他的队友与一起合作的伙伴，小说里全然是怀疑与种种灾难。。。
三部的评测就一起写了。
2033。老游戏但是重置过，主玩剧情，难度不高，主页面音乐与好结局音乐很好听。危机感塑造的还行，人物形象到位，只是由于制作方面的种种原因我总觉得代入感没有想象的那么强，算是有点可惜（我本认为能做的更好的）。主打一个剧情共鸣，这点我甚是喜欢，需亲自游玩。游戏难度不高，轻微有点点恐怖元素（我是一点不怕，考虑到我有个玩l4d2都害怕的朋友，我认为对于恐怖的定义还是不怎么好说）。
The Last Light（最后的曙光）。大部分同上，感觉末日带来的震撼感要更强一点，并且主要以侧面刻画，算是我比较讨厌的人类战，因为不擅长潜行之类的，个人更偏向于喜欢打隧道垃圾（就是游戏里最常见的变异怪）。重点就是有着全系列最经典也是最好听的音乐The farewell，我真的是太太太太太喜欢这首歌了，如果感兴趣请务必欣赏！
Exodus（离去/离乡）一改前两作的线性流程，走的半开放式玩法，总体更加多样更耐玩，游戏流程时长也是肉眼可见的涨，美术制作等各方面大幅度优化（除了游戏本体，号称显卡杀手）。剧情一贯是在绝望中找寻希望，只不过这次由原地徘徊变为了踏上旅途，结识了许多地区的各种各样的人，也少不了危险（不详细叙述）。风景也很漂亮啊，支持高画质的可以闲的没事欣赏风景。另外由于时长的增加与大地区的变换，结束后给玩家带来的“戒断反应”也将更加强烈，也就是空虚感，类似思考人生，感慨万千。
三部游戏的通病就是，bug。恶性bug导致游戏无法过关的现象不在少数，小型不影响通关的地形或显示bug更是常见，这点必须要吐槽。
以上，综合来讲还是十分推荐的。

I watched and read many walk-through items so I was finally able to figure out what to do, where to go, how to use things which took a lot of the frustration away. The mfrs could (should) have done a better job in the explanation department for the 'non-pro' gamer as it was a huge waste of time. The 2nd play through was more enjoyable, for sure (except for the cut scenes). There are some really good parts of the game....... but as a pretty casual (non-expert) gamer I found way too much stupid s#@t while playing, even in the Normal (easiest) difficulty. For instance, every time the game starts there is a long scene that can't be skipped. I personally  would not have remembered the game is based on a book (hopefully much better than the game) after the initial 25 times this scene plays out when I started the game. Now I start the game & walk away for a couple of minutes. There also seem to be way too many cut scenes. This seems strange because even with all the stoppages it was usually extremely hard to figure out what to do or where to go. At times this was especially frustrating because while you were attempting to determine who, what or where you get attacked. Quite often more enemies attack at once than you can shoot bullets to kill because reloading or switching weapons is too slow compared to the attack rates (IE: a Nosalis can be killed, usually with 1-2 shotgun head shots. The best shotgun holds 6 rounds & takes ~5 seconds to reload. The Nosalis may attack in an ongoing group of 10-15+). So when under an intense all sided attack, IF you actually land 6 head-shots (kills)  AND run away to reload you often get chased down & slaughtered like a dog. Or if you just switch weapons many need to be loaded & cocked before using. You also NEED to explore to have enough oxygen masks/filters yet as you do this you're using up what you had been looking for & being attacked relentlessly. I turned the game off many, many times just saying ""this is too fricken dumb"". IDK, to me the entire point of a game is to be somewhat enjoyable & exciting. The game did not do that for me. Maybe if I was a much better gamer I would like it as the game does have many favorable reviews.",1682801184,1683999926,False,0,1,0.480769246816635132,0,True,False,False

[i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i] is a first person shooter game, although it contains a dose of survival. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear war. Beneath the ruins of Moscow, humans begin to live and survive in the subway stations. Radiation shaped the earth and sculpted new life forms, giving rise to new species that many of them will menace human existence. Soon the Exhibition Station will be under peril from Nosalis raids, as well as constantly facing mysterious enemies named the Dark ones. Hunter (Хантер), an elite Spartan ranger, decides to trek to Polis to report the situation to his superiors. However, with the presentiment of not returning, he consigns his dog tags to the young protagonist, Artyom (Артём), so that he can relay the message entrusted by his stepfather. This is how the journey to the Polis begins: going through dead places, tunnels and stations full of hostilities.

The narrative and script of the game is based on the novel of the same name written by Dmitry Glukhovsky. This game is an adaptation, in which we can partake in the circumstances of that world while we’re embodied in a silent character. The way of relating the story is ensured through chapters. Always Artyom reveals his insightful and intimate thoughts. We read his notes with a lyrical tone of his uncertainties, views and visions. While on the ride he becomes silent to interchange for an outside dialogue. Thus we can heed, eavesdrop or listen to them through an excellent narrative twist and role swapping that allows us to understand their context through opinions and anecdotes. The game tries to show us Artyom's intimate journey, made on purpose in a first person camera and with a brilliant script. It’s shrewd, insightful, ironic, cynical, and with a wide variety of tones and voices. Without a doubt, this is an excellent narrative game as if it were an interactive novel.

The game suggestions three varieties of sensations: fear of hostility, loneliness, and the feeling of home in subway stations. We can perceive all of this in the design of the levels, enemies and characters, as well as its artistic side. On the one hand we have an oppressive and dark atmosphere dominated by unknown hostiles. Where exploration becomes a deadly trap. The game manages to convey that feeling of constant danger. Outside, the dead city, is visible by dilapidated buildings with dying vegetation. The colour palette between blue, grey and white are appropriate with which they expose deterioration and loneliness. The tunnels remain in the dark and with its mystery. The diversity of mutants overwhelms the player. While in the stations offer the opposite: warmth, security, a breather or a pause before continuing on the path. Ruled by a colour palette with warm tones (orange, brown), but always showing deterioration and decadence. A good job has been done of having various scenarios that generate numerous tensions. From the liveliness of Polis to the loneliness in the library.

[b]Playability[/b] 9/10

At the beginning of the game, we can choose one of the two game modes: Spartan (action) and Survival. The first focuses on a common shooter, with plenty of resources and no need for stealth. In the second case or mode it’s the opposition to the first.

Stealth is something that’s well implemented, especially when playing the highest difficulties. So we must watch our movements and not step on broken glass, or stumble over traps (made of cans, booby-traps or spike traps). All of them make a noise that can trigger combat. Being crouched with the lights off, we attract less attention. Enemies are usually alert when running into a corpse, they see us walking/sprinting or when they’ve heard our footsteps. They won't stop looking for us. There are actions to shoot down or take down an enemy stealthily. For the first case there are throwing knives as we can also attach a silencer to some weapons. For the second case, being behind the enemy: we can eliminate him or leave him unconscious. Other actions that allow better stealth is the action of deactivating traps, turning off generators or shooting lights. Darkness and silence becomes the best condition to play stealth. It all depends on how we move and use our surroundings.

We get resources and weapons in two ways. Some we can buy, sell and trade at stalls and kiosks located in some stations, while others we find while exploring and looting different places (crates, strongboxes or bodies). The in-game currency is military-grade bullets. First aid kits and filters will be important in the game. We can also purchase and add attachments to weapons. An important note, only rifles can utilize both ammos, so it's important to verify the appearance of bullets contained in the magazine. The gas mask plays an important role during exploration. It requires constant filters: a clock will display duration of a filter. Once consumed it will emit a beep to replace it. If the mask breaks, we agonize suffocated. Although there will be bodies with masks with which we can change them. To avoid getting lost, we have a compass and a board where our objectives and indications are. We also have some other items that will help us on our expedition. The indicators are simple and that would be the basic elements of the game. It all depends on the player.

[b]Music and FX[/b] 10/10

The soundtrack was composed by Alexey Omelchuk and Geology Beloglazov. The music expresses Artyom's journey and also contains two main themes: the new civilization inside the metro and the ruins of Moscow (or the ruin of civilization). There are three musical styles within the game. The classical guitar that we hear in the intro and in the subway stations. The melody is warm, mellifluous and a bit nostalgic. Through the arpeggios and the warm chords it gives that homely but ominous feeling that resides or belong to the subway. The music of the guitar causes that need to be together with people and it does it well by wanting to stay in a station. That is one of the leitmotivs that reflects the new life in the subway. That and mixed with the noise of the crowd talking.

The other musical style present is electronic music. It does this in a few brief moments by implementing music similar to action movies. That accentuates the drama of the action. Although such music was not necessary. For that there is a counterweight, minimal dark ambient (with drone and down tempo noise) in some places that instigates fear, disturbing and horror. A good mix for those ambient sounds, consists of the presence of noise from environment (distant moans, mutants howl or growl, the wind rustles or some object falls from its place). The third style is condensed and concentrated on the leitmotiv for Artyom. They are symphonic pieces that accentuate the narrative drama of the game. Many of these are already found in the chords played on the guitar. The symphony shows us the cruel, dark and harsh atmosphere in which the world has been transformed. It uses many dark and gloomy tones. Always it highlights the strings. But it manages to provoke us that feeling of fear, commotion and astonish at every moment. As a plus, a good soundtrack will always have something of a miscellany — a little rock or a waltz, maybe?

[b]Duration[/b] 9/10

Redux is a better-quality version of the previous game of the same name. Apart from its various difficulties, the game contains a brilliant narrative. I played both versions. In the end, a seed of nostalgia grew in me when visiting each place in this game. The game is durable, the exploration is not demanding, and the high difficulty is not ruthless. The journey of this messenger is worth enjoying. Without a good script the game would be hollow, sterile and empty.

If you've played the original, then the shooting and movement feel much smoother and it looks much better. Additionally, you can now pick up groups of items at a time instead of individually, which makes scavenging for items a little less time consuming. They also added additional notes which you can pick up, which function as audio logs, and these add additional information about the world and help flesh out Artyom as a character, although there are some spelling/grammatical errors in these files near the end of the game. The main problem that I have with the game overall is that you can't hold as much ammunition as the original. Some players may prefer this, but I kind of liked being able to horde ammo for the end-game. It felt like a reward for successfully using stealth throughout the early and mid-game. They also removed the ability to buy armor and the stealth suit from the Redux version, which is kind of disappointing because that choice allowed players to enhance their preferred playstyle. However, these gripes are pretty minor and should not be a reason why you don't play this game.  Definitely check this one out.",1683583807,1683583807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, it is noticeable that the first game of the trilogy lacks a clear path, and its quality is rather mediocre when compared to its successors. The game tries hard to be like F.E.A.R., with its dark corridors, ghostly apparitions, and sudden visions in long hallways, forcing you to flee from something. The inspiration is clear, but what's cool is that you can approach many combat encounters stealthily, which takes some time, but it makes you feel pretty cool. The world is the actual star of the game, with its bombed-out Moscow, abandoned ruins on the surface, and shantytowns underground in the titular Metro, with the crowded survivors seemingly going about their daily lives. The game is atmospheric, even though some of the dialogue with Russian dialects feels a bit cringe. Some characters also behave illogically, like Sasha, a little boy whose uncle has just died. Without knowing me, he just goes off with a stranger and seems happy instead of mourning his uncle's death. When not sneaking, you shoot monsters and people with up to three weapons. The weapons are standard, but the game has a twist: ammunition is the currency to buy items and weapons. It's pretty cool, but managing ammo on normal difficulty is never really essential, but that changes on higher settings. You travel from station to station, from railway station to railway station, through dark atmospheric corridors, to reach the end. The ending is rushed, but bombastic, and it basically leads into the second part, which takes things up a notch.

The game is more annoying then enjoyable. This is my own take even though the majority of people like the game, i hated 80% of my play through.

The game excels in crafting an incredible atmosphere and providing an engaging survival experience, immersing players in a chilling, captivating world that leaves a lasting impression.

The visual design in Metro 2033 is masterfully crafted, with dimly lit tunnels, eerie shadows, and desolate, frozen landscapes perfectly capturing the essence of a world ravaged by nuclear war. The attention to detail in the environments, from the makeshift settlements to the remnants of the past world, serves to draw players deeper into the world of Metro 2033.

The story follows Artyom, a young man born in the underground Metro, as he embarks on a perilous journey through the tunnels to save his home station from an impending threat.

The game's themes of hope, sacrifice, and the nature of humanity resonate deeply with players.

The atmosphere in Metro 2033 is nothing short of exceptional. The pacing balances moments of tense, claustrophobic horror with brief glimpses of beauty in the devastated world above. The game's sound design further enhances this atmosphere, with the distant howls of mutated creatures and the creaking of the decaying Metro tunnels instilling a constant sense of unease.

Gameplay in Metro 2033 combines first-person shooter mechanics with survival horror elements, requiring players to manage resources such as ammunition and air filters carefully. The game also features stealth mechanics, allowing players to navigate through dangerous situations by either confronting enemies head-on or using the shadows to their advantage. These gameplay elements serve to create a sense of vulnerability and tension that keeps players engaged and connected to the game world.

In conclusion, Metro 2033 is a masterfully designed experience that effectively transports players to a hauntingly beautiful post-apocalyptic world. With its captivating narrative, stunning visuals, exceptional atmosphere, and engaging survival elements, Metro 2033 stands as a testament to the power of atmospheric, story-driven games.

This game is absolutely superb. It is disappointing to see that this game does not have the recognition it deserves (at least in the west), as this game ought to be on top FPS lists everywhere. This is my favorite game out of the current trilogy, but the others are still absolutely spectacular. I will now dive deeper into the specifics of what makes this game truly remarkable.

Firstly, the story needs to be dealt with. This game is based on a book series, Metro (2033, 2034, and 2035), which was written by the Russian author Dmitry Glukovsky. The books are excellent as well, I highly recommend that you pick them up as well (there are English, French, Polish, German, and Russian versions if I can recall correctly). This game (2033) is based more on the original source material than the later two entries in the series and the story mostly follows the plot of the first book, Metro 2033. The adaptation of the book into a video game was done fabulously and the story is gripping and emotional. The only way I feel the game doesn't quite get from the books is Artyom's naivety; he is a silent protagonist in the game and feels like an expert on everything while he is quite the noob in the books. In my opinion, this doesn't really detract from the game's story and emotion though, it is just different from the source material.

Gameplay is unique and feels specifically like its own thing. It is very recognizable movement, stealth, and shooting that feels like Metro. This game is not really a run and gun shooter like Titanfall or Quake, it is a slower paced stealth based shooter. Realism is a key part of the game here with Artyom needing to replace gas mask filters to stay alive and only a few bullets can take him out. There is even a mode that removes the HUD for full immersion. My only gripe is that movement feels loose and kind of clunky at times, but the game design is very compensating of the way movement works, so this really isn't that much of a problem. Overall, incredibly good.

The game is very technically impressive as well with stunning graphics for its age and very good performance. The game is very well optimized and runs at very high FPS (hits my 144hz cap) on max settings  on my RTX 3060 Laptop. Character animations and models are also very good for its time and even hold up well today. The main impressive feature of the game is the lighting which really gives a good creepy vibe to the game and enhances gameplay alongside the stealth features. This game is still very beautiful today. New AAA games should be held to this game's standards.

Graphics: 10/10

I don't know anything about the book or the universe beyond what this game has shown me so far, but I have completed the campaign and am intrigued to find out what the sequels offer. Metro starts you off in a battle alongside the Rangers, fighting with strange beast creatures. At one point during the fight, you flashback to a time when you not a member of the fighting force. You are just an armed citizen of the Metro. You are Artyom, and you are tasked with saving the Metro, unknowingly at the time. As you proceed through the campaign, you will get to fight many strange enemies, human or not, with a increasingly more potent array of weapons and gear. All of which is scavenged. Eventually, you emerge from the tunnels to complete your mission, deal with a terrible walking mission, and then BOOM credits roll.
Pretty good.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
+The atmosphere is STUNNING.
+Visual style is very good, even for a game that is over 10 years old at this point.
+If bought recently, runs flawlessly. No frame hiccups, no audio issues, no crashing.
+Audio engine really supports all of the ambiance and effects. This really has you feeling claustrophobic in the tunnels, and very different in the chasms and larger areas.
+Weapons are great. Every weapons has a unique usage style, and also support attachments to tweak each gun. Big shotgun? Get a hip fire laser. Big revolver? Get a scope and suppressor on that bad boy. The style of the weapons fits the theme, and are pretty sweet to look at as well. the animations for all the guns are very well done as well.
+Introduction to the universe was a slow burn, but also doesn't leave me wondering what all of this was about. READ THE NOTES YOU FIND and the game becomes much more than just a tense tunnel shooter.
+Never feeling lost after returning to this game in the back log. I completed the game in roughly 8 hours over the course of several years of ownership, and at the beginning of each session I remembered the events before. Not too many games can pull off having so many good clinch moments to jump in and out of a game with, so this is a MAJOR plus!
+Works offline.

[h1] Cons [/h1]
-The game is a tunnel, both in theme and game play. 1 and done, unless you want to try certain parts in different ways. The game is linear. I completed the campaign in 8 hours (spread across several years of ownership) and honestly, I don't think I'll ever do another run again.
-Playing without the use of headphones is DETRIMENTAL to the experience. Most games have a pretty decent stereo mixing setup for tv/speaker users, but this game just doesn't do well in that regard. Make sure to play this one with some headphones.
-The walking mission at the end. What was the point of turning that into game play? It could have been a trippy cut scene with a few QTEs sprinkled in. As a hater of QTEs, I think that they would have been a better alternative to what that part offered.

metro 2033 redux is a FPS survival horror game developed by 4A games and published by deep silver. this is a remaster of metro 2033, a game that came out in march 2010 based on dmitry glukhovsky's novel of the same name. metro 2033 was the debut title for 4A games, whose founders had experience working on the s.t.a.l.k.e.r. games before founding the studio. metro 2033 was originally published by THQ, but deep silver acquired the publishing rights from them before releasing the sequel, metro last light in 2013. in august of 2014, both games were remastered for PC, PS4, & xbox one. it was also later released on the nintendo switch in 2020.

metro 2033 redux is a classic first person shooter with a linear level layout. it's predominantly set in the tunnels of the moscow metro so it makes sense narratively at least. the game does feature survival horror elements so you want to preserve ammunition and have a constant need to scavenge for supplies on dead bodies and throughout the level. ammunition also acts as currency, and it can be traded for weapons and upgrades. the atmosphere and immersion you get as a result is considered one of the game's highlights, as it puts you right into the amazing dark post-apocalyptic setting. the AI definitely needs some work as it is entirely too easy on every difficulty and the best way to play the game is to start ion the highest difficulty with survival/hardcore mode turned on. 

i definitely recommend waiting for a sale for this game as you can get it for $3.99 on it's own, or in the metro saga bundle, you can get this game, last light redux, and metro exodus for around $15. those are great prices for a couple almost-decade-old remasters, PLUS you get the third game in the saga and it's season pass.",1682732375,1682735951,True,1,0,0.464366346597671509,0,True,False,False

Absolute garbage. Don't waste your time on this dumpsterfire.

-Old, clunky and frustrating mechanics.
-Unsatisfying combat. Absolutely horrible and clunky.
-Empty characters that you feel nothing for.
-Boring, repetitive missions basically going from point A to point B every single time.
-Linear, bland, same old overused fallout schtick. Anybody who tags this game ''story rich'' clearly never played an actual story rich game in their lives. If this game is story rich then super mario is story rich too. Not to insult super mario, that game isn't so bad.
-No skill tree. No crafting. No character customization. No item customization that makes a difference whatsoever.
-No real choices.
-No immersion whatsoever. BORING.
-Not engaging at all, I basically forced myself to play just to see if anything would improve but it didn't. Felt like doing a chore.
-Graphics are pretty outdated.
-Lazy map design, invisible walls everywhere you can't go to. Makes the game even more linear. And I fell through a map once so there's also invisible gaps you can fall through and die. That tells a lot about how bad it is.
-No freedom to roam around besides there's nothing to explore. It's just empty.
-Short. Game can be finished in 6 hours maybe less, I afk'd a lot cos I couldn't stand the boredom. I kept alt-tabbing mid-game to watch videos of paint drying on youtube. It was a lot more interesting than this garbage.
-Economy. Lazy design again. Everything on market if you wanna sell something you don't gain much at all, but if you wanna buy something you buy it for like x7 times the price you'd sell. Ridiculous.
-Difficulty settings. The only difference between normal mode and hard mode is the HUD. I find that hilarious. That's what it comes down to? Just disabling the hud? That's all you got? I mean sure a new player will struggle but after one playthough when you get familiar with the game and keybinds it doesn't make the slightest difference. Just dumb. You will already know what keys to press.

Nothing. Just nothing. Completely forgettable. A bad game is an understatement. All you do is follow an npc or go to a designated point alone and kill some overgrown dogs along the way. Point A to Point B. It's basically a WALKING SIMULATOR. It doesn't feel ''atmospheric'' AT ALL. It's certainly not ''horror'' or ''story rich'' or ''survival'' or any of that. I don't know who made these tags but you might need to lay off on that vodka a little bit comrade.  I assume the only reason this game has so many positive reviews is the sheer number of russian fanboys on steam and herd psychology. It's also very cheap and has low system reqs. Thus they can actually afford to play it. Ha. Got em.

Set in the ruins of Moscow after a devastating nuclear war, Metro 2033 follows the story of Artyom, a young man who must fight for survival in the harsh and dangerous underground metro tunnels. The game features a compelling narrative, with well-developed characters and a deep lore that draws you into the world.

The graphics of the game are stunning, with detailed environments that evoke a sense of dread and despair. The lighting and sound design are also top-notch, creating a tense and atmospheric atmosphere throughout the game.

One of the most impressive aspects of Metro 2033 is its unique gameplay mechanics. The game features a combination of first-person shooter and survival horror elements, with a heavy emphasis on stealth and resource management. The player must scavenge for supplies, craft weapons and ammunition, and carefully navigate the dangerous tunnels filled with hostile creatures and enemy factions.

Overall, Metro 2033 is an amazing game that manages to deliver a truly immersive and engaging experience.

A forewarning before I elaborate further, there will be some spoilers in this review and I will note such spoilers as such by blacking them out in my review. View these spoilers at your own risk, as that is your choice if you ruin the game’s story for yourself. You have been warned.

Pros – Elaborations:

[b]Good remastered graphics[/b]

I like that this game was cleaned up and polished for newer hardware and made to look better than it had before. I very much liked how the game looked.

[b]Improved mechanics[/b]

Props on 4A games for improving the mechanics of the old game and adding quality of life features from Exodus such as giving the ability to wipe the gas mask visor off, for example. 

[b]Decent story[/b]

I liked how the story of Artyom thrust a young, 20 year old man out into the brutal world of the Metro, only to find out that he was the one to be lucky enough to understand the words of [spoiler]The Dark Ones, where they desperately try to communicate with him and tell him who they really are[/spoiler].


[b]Likable characters for the most part[/b]

I enjoyed the characters Artyom is introduced to in his journey such as Khan, Bourbon, along with his [spoiler]Ranger brothers[/spoiler] and how they interacted with him.

Cons – Elaborations:

[b]Game-breaking bugs remain even long after the game was released[/b]

This is especially notable with the Tihar, a semi-automatic multi-stroke air gun that you get which ends up being a pretty good silent weapon to easily and stealthily take out enemies. The bug started occurring with me later in the game where [spoiler]the Nazis were on the surface of the Metro in a outpost[/spoiler]. This game-breaking bug occurs when you over-pressurize the Tihar, causing functions such as lowering and raising your [spoiler]Night Vision Goggles[/spoiler] as well as making it impossible to aim down the sights of any weapon. I learned about this bug later on and ended up ditching the Tihar as a result. This bug still remains in Metro 2033 Redux as far as I am aware.

[b]Metro 2033 having multiple endings was completely pointless[/b] 

Having more than one ending was pointless and putting stock into one of them [spoiler](The ‘Enlightened’ Ending)[/spoiler] was a complete and utter waste of time. If you want to be less disappointed in the ending of this game, just go for the other ending [spoiler](The Canon Ending, known as the ‘Ranger Ending)[/spoiler]. While I’m not at all against [spoiler]dark, depressing endings that are full of dread and tragedy,[/spoiler] I take issue with it when the following game after doesn’t acknowledge the other ending in any way. I’m not saying it has to follow through in the next game or anything, but tie it off somehow to fit it in the ending the developers clearly wanted you to play and get. 

[b]The ally AI was pretty much useless[/b]

I get that in most shooters that you are supposed to be the one killing the enemies and living out a power fantasy. But when it seems as if your allies are as blind as bats, as deaf as Beethoven, and have guns loaded with .22 caliber rounds to kill mutants it makes them pretty much a liability and completely useless.

Anyway, that’s my review and to some extent, a bit of vent about a game I liked. I don’t suggest this game unless you get just this game or the bundle it’s in on deep discount.

My score: 7.6 out of 10

Stealth is still broken, wonky, and just plain dumb as hell (also not fun). Survival is a worthless difficulty option; all it does is make everything more cumbersome and you'll likely be playing on Ranger which limits you to two weapons so the ""less pickups"" shit hardly matters at all. Speaking of Ranger, what absolute moron thought to NOT include a simple tutorial for the controls at the beginning, especially since half of the controls are the most dumb shit ever (M for the fucking lighter?).
There's still tons of annoying bugs/crashes that force you to reload chapters, still a bunch of goofy sound effects that ruin the atmosphere (a big deal in this game since the atmosphere is the ONLY good part), annoying gimmick sections, some with bad controls, and you STILL have to manually fix the god awful FOV and even when you do you can still tell it's fucked up.

As a fan of Fallout, Last of Us, sneaking (Metal Gear Solid, hello!) and general survival games, this was an absolute treat - I'm sorry I didn't play it earlier and kept on passing it over.

Oftentimes it was difficult to know where to go navigation wise, which lead to wasting time and filters, but I guess that only lends itself to the tension of trying to balance supplies, acting quickly yet cautiously, and avoiding or, depending on one's playstyle, engaging enemies.  I enjoyed being able to choose my style of knocking out human enemies, and how curiosity was rewarded well in this game (though often a sheer necessity when looking for supplies).  Sometimes instructions were unclear for certain missions - on one I was left fighting waves of enemies only to discover I had to actually go out into the fray and find supplies to stop the attacks, but that was only ascertained after I had completely run out of bullets trying to defend an outpost and died several times.

I hate to say it but the librarians scared the living daylights out of me more than anything else and I ended up doing a speedrun through that level (hah!).  If I never run into one again, I'll be immensely happy.

This version makes a few tweaks to the original, but the overall experience is the same. This last time I played it felt a little more like a shooter than adventure/survival. There were plenty of ammo and health packs (in a world that supposedly struggling to survive so much that ammo is literally the new currency), and I was able to run and gun a little more than I had wanted to. That was probably based on the settings and difficulty I set it at, however. Despite that, this game still feels very unique. You have to make sure your flashlight and night vision goggles are fully charged, you can use a lighter for a slight bit of light as well as burning spiderwebs, and check your objectives in real time ton your clipboard.

A lot of people MIGHT compare this  to the Fallout series, and say that it's just a ""linear, non open world version"" of those games, and while I can see where they're coming from, I feel this is nowhere near the case. Yeah, they're both set in a post nuclear apocalypse setting, the tones and game play aren't supposed to resemble each other. This game is cramped and claustrophobic on purpose, as it's all set within the confines of the subway tunnels. You're supposed to feel trapped and confined in this game, and the story has far less humor than the Fallout games. 

My only complaint with this versions is I found a few texture glitches that I hadn't seen in the original (layers of textures not playing nice and clipping and tearing through each other whenever I would move to look at things, as well as a couple spelling errors within the journals), but they weren't anything that I felt destroyed my experience with this one.

Definitely try this one out if you haven't played these games yet. It's certainly one of my favorites. Even if you've played Last Light or Exodus first, if you haven't played Metro 2033, it's well worth a play through.",1678633911,1679932988,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is pretty standard for the genre, just your average post-apocalyptic plot where the main character has to go from point A to point B, however the gameplay speaks for itself. I played on Survival and I don't regret it, it's challenging, but fair. It feels rewarding when you actually explore some of the linear environments and find better supplies. You also get this very satisfying feeling whenever you swap out one of your ammo-less guns with ones that do have plenty of ammo, just in time before you get ate up by those monsters or fascists bullets. It's heavily reminiscent of the STALKER games, (which it's most likely inspired by), but with prettier visuals and guns that actually hit something most of the time. The best parts of the game is whenever you fight the human enemies, they do not f*ck around and have a lot of armor, which makes it euphoric whenever you mow them all down with whatever arsenal you have in stock. Metro 2033 Redux has it's fair share of bugs though, pretty much the game's only blunder. I'm not just talking about goofy ragdoll effects, I'm talking about falling through the world sometimes and the game refusing to move ahead, forcing me to reload the closest checkpoint. Not too many glitches, but these took me out of the game and can be spotted easily. It's a great game though, worth the experience and price.",1679689697,1679689795,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Where other FPS relish in how much they can give the player, new weapons, abilities, skill trees, Metro excels through what it manages to take away.  Fewer weapons, limited upgrades, limited currency (that you can use as ammo in a pinch), few light sources, and linear level-design allow Metro to expertly curate your experience so that you get the most out of the world of the metro, and the mysteries unfolding within it.

A complaint that I've seen a lot of people have with this game is that it's linear, and while that is understandable, I think that the game is stronger for its focused execution.  It didn't feel linear while I played it for the first time.  There is a genuine thrill to feeling your way around in the dark, trying to find any to keep pushing forward to accomplish your seemingly impossible journey.  Every scripted moment felt genuinely surprising and the danger felt very real.  The game is still difficult, and it still rewards deviating off the beaten path, if only slightly.  The linear nature of the game also serves the story incredibly well, as it just continues to build momentum.  By the end, you are locked in.

Metro 2033 Redux is... interesting in its way. Playing through both Survivor and Spartan Modes of the game, I could only gather a mixed bag of a game review. However, before I go into details, I'll put a disclaimer and admit that I never played the original game, nor did I interact with the franchise prior, so this is purely a standalone game review, not comparison to the original product review.

Metro 2033 takes place in Moscow, twenty years after World War III devastates the capital of Russia, and, subsequently, the world. Most of the surface has become uninhabitable, courtesy of nuclear fallout and mutated creatures taking over, forcing the survivors to descend into the Moscow Metropolitan to outlast and overcome the extinction threat. The game narrates the story of Artyom, the inhabitant of 'Exhibition' subway station, whose survival routine is interrupted by his family's friend, Hunter, gone missing after a mutant raid on the station. True to his word, the protagonist goes out of his way to find out the truth behind the incident, going deep into the tunnels of the Metro.

The gameplay is similar to FPS's of its time, namely Call of Duty: Modern Warfare or Far Cry. The weapon arsenal, although isn't as big, varies a lot, ranging from makeshift weapons to WWIII-era assault rifles, which can be customized with laser dots, holographic sights and suppressors. On topic of in-game economy, the most prominent feature is the currency: as the world economy was blasted away with a number of nuclear strikes, the Metro citizens adapted ammunition as means to trade with each other. On paper, this sounds like a great game feature, making you choose between conserving gun ammo to buy other tools of survival, such as med-kits or throwing knives. In practice, however, the 'ammo currency' is only applied to High-End Ammunition, which can only be used in pair with certain weapons you may not get access to until late game, but by this time you've already gotten every gun that flat-out excels High-End Ammo demanding weapons. The makeshift ammo, which you're going to use for the majority of the game, is easy to come by and can be bought for a relatively cheap price from vendors.

The story and lore were interesting to dive into at first, but eventually got dull and sometimes lacking, with some prominent plot holes being left behind. The whole concept of The Dark Ones and them being portrayed as the primary antagonists, who, in reality, only appeared in Artyom's daydreams, which by themselves were merely a plot device to keep you on feet with the supernatural theme of the apocalypse. Khan was a missed opportunity for a main character, only appearing twice in the entire game and only for a short period of time. Some of the supporting characters were exaggerated in terms of altruism and comradeship, easily sacrificing themselves with a grenade in their arm after being overwhelmed by the enemies; one or two sequences like that could be fine for the overall atmosphere, but this theme continued throughout the entire game, with at least three characters ultimately throwing themselves into a horde of enemies to let the protagonist progress through the story.

The reason why I woudn't recommend buying Metro 2033 Redux at full price is concealed within its main glaring flaw, that being the target audience. From what I could tell, the game is clearly tailored for the two categories of people: die-hard STALKER fans and Russian/East European players, and that is not an exaggeration by any means. Alas, I did not fall under either of these categories, which I think is the main reason why the game didn't appeal to me. This is by no means an offense to the aforementioned people, I'd say this is a disclaimer for the West European and North American players out there like myself.

Ultimately, I found Metro 2033 an outdated and underwhelming product, given its gameplay and length, so I'd only recommend it to the people metioned above or someone looking for an eerie gameplay experience. Even for a sticker price of ~$15 CND, I'd advise to be better safe and sorry and grab it on sale if you don't want to lose much.

I myself haven’t beaten the game and am stuck on the level with the librarians. Honestly not really vibing with it past this point but I’m sure there’s worst games out there.

The atmosphere, lighting, voice acting(that part is unique in the way that its obvious theres only like 4 voice actors that play the same act for every character and its hilarious), and overall gunfights are A1. Theres also the old saying that comes into play; theres more than one way to skin a cat. Meaning theres more than one way to clear a level. And theres so many secrets in the game that i havent found yet, i used to play this game on my xbox when it came out and im still finding new things. But thats also cuz i kinda just play the game rather than search for things. And sometimes its just downright terrifying, especially against nosalises and watchmen, sometimes theyll just come outta the woodwork and scare ya. It also tends to play on your morality, in the sense that a watchman will defend her helpless babies and you decide their fate. Play it, you wont regret it. The book is worth a read as well

First, most of the game is walking behind a guide NPC while they constantly stop, tell you to wait, while something ""spooky"" happens.  This is ok once in a while, but it gets old and just pads out the game's playtime without any real gameplay.

Second, too many fights with the dog/rat/mole monsters where everything just stops while you fight a few waves of them.  This gets old really fast, and the game does it over and over again.

Third, forced first-person platforming with controls and ground collision boxes that are not made for this.  Lots of deaths to falling after making a best-effort jump.  Also an area where you need to drop down to the lowest level, but the game will kill you even dropping a few meters, unless you find the exact spot where they wanted you to drop down.

Finally, I hit a point in the Front Line chapter where the game auto-saved me right in front of an enemy vehicle coming down a tunnel.  No option to load a previous save, and I was pretty much forced to restart the whole mission or reload over and over until I got extremely lucky and executed everything just right to get out of the situation.  It was like when you accidentally quicksave right before you die, except the game did it for me of no fault of my own.

The game really shines when it lets you go in an area by yourself without any NPC guide, but these segments are few and far between, and I feel like it would be maybe 2 hours long if it only included these segments.

Techinical infomation about the Steam Deck, if you care. I ran the game at high/medium settings just with the buggy physics and motion blur off. The game ran 60 through out, though cinematic cut scenes are 30 (the beginning and ending cutscenes) and there are some audio hiccups in cutscenes. The game had a few consistent bug, mostly that certain combinations of soundFXs cause the audio to crack for a second, but a bit loud. The game isn't bugfree by any means and I fell through the floor at the end of a level (level still completed), Audio glitches, Hardlocked twice and crashed once in 7 hours of playing (thankfully the game auto saves so basically no progress was lost). The most annoying glitch was that after I got the night vision goggles I entered a cutscene with them on and since most cutscenes are in engine I had the night vision filter over the enter cutscene. That alone wouldn't realy be an issue but for the next like 5 cutscenes My guy quick threw the goggles on even though I didn't have them on and they would play in night vision. It also had me do a rail gunning section in night vision and also I had to go through two hubs with night vision on with no way to take it off (The battery actually died once in a town and I was glad because I finally had normal vision).

My only complaint is that v-sync is capped at 60fps so I left it off and had a lot of screen tearing in my playthrough (didn't think to enable v-sync by control panel which probably would have fixed this issue) but that is a relatively minor complaint considering the quality of this game.

Metro 2033 Redux - це дуже захоплююча гра, яка змушує гравця відчувати напруження та відчай, які владні в постапокаліптичному світі. Гра базується на романі Дмитра Глуховського ""Метро 2033"" і переносить гравця в майбутнє, де людство виживає в мережі тунелів московського метро після ядерної війни.

Гра має дуже глибоку та емоційну історію з вражаючими персонажами, які відтворені в деталях. Гравець відчуває багато емоцій, що змушують його зосередитися на грі і відчувати все, що відбувається в грі.

Один з найбільших плюсів гри - це атмосфера. Гра відтворює дуже відчутне враження постапокаліптичного світу, з його пустелі та небезпеками. Визначними особливостями є хороша візуальна графіка та звукове супроводження, які створюють неперевершену атмосферу.

Загалом, Metro 2033 Redux - це дуже захоплююча гра, яка буде цікава для любителів постапокаліптичних ігор та фантастики. Я б рекомендував цю гру всім, хто хоче насолодитися незабутнім досвідом гри в захоплюючому світі.

ENG:
Metro 2033 Redux is a very addictive game that makes the player feel the tension and desperation that reigns in the post-apocalyptic world. The game is based on the novel ""Metro 2033"" by Dmitry Glukhovsky and takes the player to the future, where humanity survives in the network of tunnels of the Moscow Metro after a nuclear war.

The game has a very deep and emotional story with impressive characters that are reproduced in detail. The player feels many emotions that make him focus on the game and feel everything that is happening in the game.

One of the biggest pluses of the game is the atmosphere. The game reproduces a very tangible impression of a post-apocalyptic world, with its desert and dangers. Distinctive features are good visual graphics and soundtrack, which create an unparalleled atmosphere.

In general, Metro 2033 Redux is a very exciting game that will be interesting for fans of post-apocalyptic games and fantasy. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to enjoy an unforgettable gaming experience in an exciting world.",1677327319,1677327319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's an RPG with a strong emphasis on the story, and it's the kind of game in which you can lose yourself in thanks to the lack of distracting HUD elements, much like in Dead Space.

I ended up crashing twice across my two playthroughs. once at the end of my first playthrough and once more within the Dead City during my second. Other than that, I had a great time playing with no issues at all.

To get 100%, you only need to play through the game twice, as there are no particularly difficult achievements.

NOTE: Those who are afraid of spiders or may have arachnophobia should hold off buying. there are big spider-like creatures in the game. Do your own research to see if its something you can handle.

The underground tunnels are pretty similar occasionally interrupted by a visit to the surface. The combat of this game is not smooth with slow reload mechanic and clunky movement.

This game manages to perfectly capture the sense of tension and dread that comes with surviving in a world ravaged by nuclear war.

The graphics and overall visual design of the game are truly stunning. The game world feels fully realized and immersive, with a level of detail that really brings the world to life. The sound design is also top-notch, with an excellent soundtrack and atmospheric sound effects that help to set the mood.

The game play is incredibly engaging, with a great mix of stealth, combat, and exploration. The mechanics are well-designed and easy to pick up, but still provide a satisfying challenge. The game also has a great story, with well-developed characters and an intriguing plot that kept me hooked from start to finish.

Overall, Metro 2033 Redux is an outstanding game that is definitely worth playing.

1. Game not launching
The game might not launch for you. Its fixable if that's the case. There is a link to download a C++ redistributable to fix that ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679 ). The game should launch after it's run and shouldn't have any more issues related to launches. You might still experience some minor lag/stuttering but they are rare and don't happen in the same areas once reloaded. I haven't experienced any crashes so far.

2. Spiderwebs and your lighter
You might notice that going through spider webs will slow down your movement. You can destroy the webs by equipping your lighter (press M). It also will have the added bonus of getting rid of the spiders if you're an arachnophobe. 

3. Battery and charge
You won't really notice at first, but as time goes on your trusty flashlight will go from bright to dog-shit rather quickly. You have a recharger with you that the games doesn't tell you about for some reason. It becomes especially useful after you gain access to some night-vision goggles. (Press and hold F to equip the recharger and right click repeatedly to recharge your batteries).

4. Weapon selection and throwables
You won't really find out if you don't look at your keyboard/controller binds in the menu, but you can have a more detailed view on weapon and equipment loadouts than just the number keys at the top of your keyboard. It shows you what weapons you have, all the ammo you have (for weapons you do or don't have including military-grade ammo), how much time you have left on your filters, and your throwables (press/maybe hold onto tab). You can select your throwables in the bottom left of that menu and you can then throw them in combat (press C). 

5. Military-Grade ammo and regular ammo
You have access to two different types of ammo depending on your currently equipped weapon. They are military-grade ammo and regular ammo. The regular ammo is the one you pick up the most and is what you would preferably use through most of the game. Military-Grade ammo is the currency of the game (used to buy weapons and their attachments, regular ammo, throwables, filters, and health kits), however it can be used in a pinch to defend yourself (Hold R to switch between ammo types). As far as I know, military-grade ammo is only able to be used in modern weaponry, not in the makeshift weapons or in pistols. Do keep in mind that it is only advisable to use military-grade ammo in emergencies as depleting it will mean that you won't have any to purchase upgrades or resupply when the opportunity presents itself. 

And that's everything that comes to mind as of right now. This is a solid game with some small hiccups, but they shouldn't discourage you from getting it. They are fixable or can be accessed with the right knowledge. I will update this review as things come to my attention as I'm still a ways into the game.

Post-apocalyptic mayhem: Who doesn't love a good end-of-the-world scenario? With Metro 2033 Redux, you get to experience the thrill of surviving in a world that has been utterly destroyed by nuclear war. Plus, it's a great way to prepare for the inevitable zombie apocalypse.

Immersive atmosphere: The game's stunning graphics and eerie sounds will transport you to a post-apocalyptic Moscow that's teeming with danger and suspense. It's so immersive, you'll feel like you're really there, dodging mutants and scavenging for supplies.

Engaging storyline: Metro 2033 Redux has a gripping storyline that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. You play as Artyom, a survivor who must journey through the underground Metro tunnels to save his people from a new threat. It's like a Russian version of The Walking Dead, but with more guns.

Challenging gameplay: The game's challenging mechanics will keep you on your toes, whether you're sneaking past mutants or engaging in intense firefights with enemy soldiers. It's a game that rewards strategy and quick reflexes, so get ready to think fast and shoot even faster.

Multiple endings: Your choices in the game affect the outcome of the story, so there's plenty of replayability. With multiple endings to discover, you'll want to go back and try different approaches to see how the story plays out.

Gas mask: Let's be honest, the real reason to play Metro 2033 Redux is so you can feel like a total badass wearing a gas mask. It's like being a superhero, but with radiation poisoning. Plus, it's a great way to keep the coronavirus at bay.",1677012587,1677012587,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Metro is a universe created by Dmitri Gloukhovski and most like other contomporary works of fiction written by individuals from the other side of the world (like The Witcher), this universe has been adapted as a videogame series and quite amazingly so, I might add.

In this very atmospheric FPS, you take on the role of Arteum (or Artyom, whatever you fancy), who was born and raised in an underground station. Thing is, after the nuclear bombs fell, the surface world has become uninhabitable... and to discover the waste that lies upstairs, you'd have to wear anti-radiation gear and arm yourself to the teeth to fight off all the mutated hordes of hungry rabbits, sheep and fliers that live and strive in the radiation. Humanity, living now in Metro Stations, must make do with whatever food supplies they have down there before they send their ""rangers"" up there for supply runs. It's a genious idea and a very probable apocalyptic scenario. Arteum will find himself, in no time, entangled in a plot bigger than all of the Metro network.

The game does absolutly great when it comes to the weapon play... As a typical shooter, you're allowed to take aim and enjoy headshots and whatnot... but unlike other typical shooters, the mutated specimens strewn around the Metro and the surface allow for some very costly jumpscares... One frightening case of ""poop my pants"" was the Librarian; a mutated humanoid blob of... irradiated matter... who stalks you and strikes at the most opportune of moments.

The only let down with this game was the Russian English accent... NOOOO! I'm gonna get the biggest backlash because of this, but it's true! You might have a much better experience with Metro games if you just suffer through the Russian English with subtitles, than to actually play it with the atrocious Russian English accent... Imagine The Witcher with a Polish English accent, wouldn't that have been annoying as all hell? Anyways, the game is awesome... the accent makes it not so immersive, but it's still very original. [b] 9/10 [/b] FPS that was way ahead of its time.

Everything is going perfectly, you buy some ice cream, you enjoy yourself, and then the world around you burns. Missiles crash into the ground and explode, and later nukes, you hastily retreat into the underground city metro. Although this scenario is quite extreme it is what happened to the people of Moscow in the Metro 2033 world by Dmitry Glukhovsky, and what you as the player wake up to after a few years living in the metro. Metro 2033 is a great game, here's why. (and you should play it!)
	Metro 2033 takes place in the near future after a global nuclear conflict has left, at least Moscow, totally destroyed and in a nuclear winter. You play as someone named Artyom and start his adventure through the tunnels of the Metro and onto the surface of the destroyed world. With 12.8 almost 13 hours in Metro 2033 and having finished the entire series after many more hours, I can say that it is more than good. Metro 2033 has many amazing aspects so we will go one section at a time discussing them.

Story ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
	The Metro 2033 story is amazing; due to the fact that it's based on a book series of the same name by Dmitry Glukhovsky. With five million copies sold in 37 different countries, you can expect the book and therefore the story to be good and the stats back that up, on amazon, the book has 4.7 stars with 79% of those being 5-star reviews. This amazing narrative makes the game's story make sense and keeps everything following. His book is the foundation of the game and creates a very powerful story-driving narrative.
	That gets me to my next point. Metro 2033 is a story-based game, now I won't get into the details of the story to avoid spoilers but it is good. Some of you are now turned away from the game, ¨ew a story-based game? All I want to do is to shoot monsters!¨ but believe me when I say many many monsters will die at your hands, and much like Yin and Yang the story revolves around combat and combat around the story.

Combat ⭐⭐⭐⭐
	Metros combat is solid, although not the best I've played. The combat system is split into two paths, stealth, and fighting. There are a total of ten weapons Metro has to offer all with modifications and attachments available that do drastically change the play style of a gun, surprisingly the revolver is pretty versatile. Obviously, you can go for a combat and fighting play style, always shooting your way through every encounter, and the game does have settings that make this option more fun and doable. But the game is designed in a survival stealth play style that you can easily increase in difficulty in the start menu. When playing this way your supplies will be very limited and stealth is the most effective way to get through your enemies, especially humans. Personally, I find the stealth play style very fun and it fits the game really well, having to sneak past enemies looting and to get behind them to silently take them down. The game's flashlight is also designed around this as enemies will see it if it's on and start shooting, whereas, with the night vision goggles, this debuff is removed.

Setting ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
	The metro setting is insanely well done, you can tell the game developers put a lot of effort into making you feel as though you are there, with good headphones this effect is very potent. The general ambiance of the metro tunnels is perfect, dark, scary, radioactive glowing mushrooms, corpses of brave souls who died, you are never sure what will be ahead, your flashlight only going a bit ahead of you. But occasionally there are moments when you can feel safe, light coming down from the world above. The metro stations, their version of towns, are full of life, even though there are not that many NPCs walking around or vendors selling goods, the stations feel more alive than countless of the other games have played, you can tell what it would be like to live in these settlements, always in fear, not much space, and food always being an issue. One of the best touches to make this world feel alive is the currency, military-grade bullets, you can shoot them and they do more damage, but the vendors take them as money, showing how much weapons and bullets are needed to keep everyone alive and safe and how dangerous the tunnels truly are. 
The surface is a different story, there are no moments of peace on the surface, and you are in constant fear. There could be any number of dangers around every bend, from packs of hungry mutants to flying demons. You literally are never safe. You also have more to manage on the surface which can lead to very tense situations, your gas mask needs its filter changed every few minutes and if its alarm goes off during combat you are in for a sticky situation, that is if it's not already broken from being hit… 

Settings/Graphics ⭐⭐⭐⭐/⭐⭐⭐
	Metro has a large variety of gameplay settings, with five different difficulty settings and four levels of graphic settings; your game can be however you want on any system you want. I really don't have much to say here but I'll mention a few things. First, the difficulty settings are very good in this game, turning up the difficulty level will affect how you play the game. If you want more information I would go look at the wiki. Second, the graphics are pretty good for a 13-year-old game. They can stand up to time. The graphics setting will allow for any modern system to run Metro, the recommended settings on Steam show you only need 4GB of ram and a GeForce GTX 480 to run, and a 280 for minimum settings, the game will not be pretty but it will run with such low graphics. If you have anywhere near a modern system you should easily be able to run the game with max settings. With max settings, the game looks good, a few areas should look better, but for a 13-year-old game the graphics are amazing at max and after a while, of playing you won't notice the lack of photorealistic graphics. And if you do notice, there are mods that you can get that add in way more enhanced graphics, and/or raytracing!

In conclusion, I believe that Metro 2033 is a great game. For the low price of $20; It has an amazing story, an amazing setting, good combat, and decent graphics. From a story-based gamer's perspective, this game could even be up with RDR2 in its story. And I am not alone Metro 2033 has almost 60,000 reviews on steam and 88% of those are positive reviews, and 95% of the 870 recent reviews are also positive, there are still active players and still people reviewing the game. Even though it's 13 years old it still puts up a hell of a fight.

It doesn't look bad texture wise but some of the animations can seem a bit stiff and robotic, so if you wan't ultimate graphics, you came to the wrong game.

Now that we have that out of the way, lets start with the actual review. For starters, I'll talk about the story(without going into too much detail). You play as Artyom, a Russian boy who grew up living in the metros of a post-apocalyptic Moscow. One day your uncle comes to visit your settlement, of which is promptly attacked by the mutated creatures that now roam the metros and surface wastes. After defending your settlement from a mutant invasion, your uncle is informed about an attack that is occurring and leaves, giving you a message to deliver to the group he is a part of. From there the game takes you on a wild run through the desolate metro tunnels and toxic surface wastes, helping and killing people along the way. The game has some decisions that when made could lead to one of two different endings. Some of the decisions can be really easy to miss which can make getting a desired ending kind of annoying without the use of a guide. All in all, the story is good, though nothing particularly special, and definitely worth at least one playthrough.

The gameplay is a bit of a different beast. While it advertises itself as a horror game, I personally wouldn't classify it as such. Granted, I played on normal, so maybe the hardest difficulty is more scary, though I imagine that is only the case because the hardest difficulty makes supplies like ammunition and the like incredibly scarce. Though even on normal difficulty resource management can be a bit of a challenge. The mutant enemies in this game tank rounds like miniature panzers; which can result in you loosing vast quantities of your ammunition stores very quickly every time you have to enter combat with a hoard of them. The human enemies are far more enjoyable to fight as you always are given multiple solutions to a problem. You can go in loud and messy, or quiet and clean. The stealth works very well, with only the occasionally weird enemy detection. My only gripe is that once they have been alerted to the fact that you're there, they never stop looking, no matter how long you stay hidden. Besides that, I would say the combat is very solid when fighting humans, and a bit frustrating when tackling any of the mutants. I will say that you need to be careful with resources though as the game has no qualms with essentially soft locking you if you run out of things like filters or ammo and can't find any nearby. I was almost unable to beat the game as I ran out of regular bullets for all my guns at the very end, and one of the last cutscenes requires you to shoot an enemy in order to progress. Luckily the bullets that you use as currency can also be used in certain guns, of which I just happened to be carrying on me.

Now for the problems. The game is buggy and a bit unoptimized. Not game breaking by any means, but it certainly has its fair share of problems. The game can be kinda laggy any time you are in a cutscene, though in my experience the rest of the game ran rather well. This is a little bit of a bummer as the games cutscene aren't terrible, and would be better if not for the massive frame drops I was getting. Mind you, I'm not running on an old system either. I have a 2080ti, Ryzen 7 3800x and 64gb of 3600mhz ram. I have a beefy computer, but the game still struggled to stay at a consistent 60 at times. As for the bugs, those range from visual, AI/gameplay, to full blown crashes. While I say crashes, I have only every crashed once, but I know that several other people are running into issues with the game crashing, so I figured it is still something to keep in mind. The visual bugs can be ignored as the are mostly just things like z fighting in several areas, but nothing that actually affects the gameplay. The AI and gameplay can be a bit of a bigger problem though. I've encountered everything from enemies continuing to stand after being killed, them snapping backwards as if they just turned on their lag switch to them just not responding to being shot. I've also run into a couple of gameplay bugs, such as getting grabbed by an enemy and upon getting out of the grab; the player model got stuck to the enemy and I was dragged around and eventually forced to reload as I couldn't move. This was probably the biggest and most breaking of bugs I found, though I only encountered it once, so I would say overall isn't anything like a Bethesda title in terms of its bugs/glitches.

Overall the game is worth getting despite the few gripes I have mentioned above. It is a definitive must play, especially if you can get the game series while its on sale, though for the amount of hours put in, I will still say it is worth picking up at full price.",1665975105,1675960995,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But more importantly, it kills exploration, as you are always in a rush, and fun, and turns the game into some kind of a sadistic exercise by the developers.  Then throw in lack of ammo on harder difficulty settings, and it's just a shit-show all around.

I'll give an example: 
There is a mission towards the end where you and a group of elite rangers sneak into archives. A massive firefight against Nosalises (mutants) begins. These elite rangers cannot hit the side of a barn with their full auto weapons, so all the Nosalises just march past them in slow motion and head toward you. You have to spend all your ammo to take them down, and then the next level begins without even giving you a chance to buy new ammo. There is stuff hidden around here and there, but it will kill all your fun to be constantly desperately searching for filters or ammo, while being seconds away from failing the level.

[b]Good Points: Good Script and Art Direction[/b]

Despite being an old game, Metro has a really good Graphics in comparison with the games released around the same year, as an CGI Artist I can say the game explore really well: 

- Good adaptation from Dmitry Glukhovsky Universe
- The environment and World Build 
- Good Modelling and textured objects 
- Really well made camera effects, creating realistic experience

[b]Bad Points: Bad Gaming Design in general[/b]

- Enemy AI dont make a Noise when approaching, as a Hardcore FPS player playing on the maximum difficulty with no HUD, is really frustrating when an enemy creature come from behind and kill you, without making a single noise, we're talking about a bear sized creature.

- Throwables keep stucking in the middle of the air sometimes, despite any FOV changes.

- Multiple commands in a single key, misleading the character action in game sometimes 

- A lot of camera effects turns the screen really polluted in some game parts

- When playing some chapters with ally AI, enemy AI will always focus the player, wich is really annoying because sometimes you're walking in the map with 3 allies and 10 creatures starts jumping on you without a single attack on friendly AI",1675602178,1675602956,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game had a really good balance between action/scary moments/relief/story - in other words, pacing. It was really enjoyable to go through the missions, but not in the ''Ok, gotta collect X, Y, and Z resources, level up, and gear up"" grindy way that keeps you hooked but isn't actually enjoyable thoroughly. I played the game on normal mode, and if I wasn't doing stupid things, I didn't really struggle for filters or ammo like I was scared I'd be. I could upgrade my weapons, but I'm not sure in the end how much of a difference that made. There's no stats to anything. I had a 3 weapon combo that just worked for me so I kept them the whole game without issue.

For me, the atmosphere was great in the game - besides the visuals: as far as we're concerned, Artyom is just a young guy given a mission that genuinely could kill him at every step of the way, but there really is no other way. There's no mentor who can help you master every skill you need before the quest, you just have to buy/scavenge as much gear as you can and get on with it, because if not you - then who? Artyom is a silent and faceless protagonist, which allows us to empathise with him all the more. He's not a badass witcher trained from childhood and mutated to suit the purpose he's given. He's us; an average girl/guy handed a gun and told ""see that horde of monsters? Let's go! Woops, actually you're on your own now, good luck."" This makes completing each mission so beautifully satisfying for lack of better word.

The world is immersive despite limited ability to interact with it in non-essential ways, and being composed of essentially corridors. Each dialogue and overheard conversation is worth hearing, and the world - although fantastical - is realistic. And the story, considering the ending, great :) 

Although I gotta say it was annoying at times, as others mentioned, how many hidden mechanics you have to discover yourself with no hint from the game - I had no idea the whole game that you could actually know how visible you are/how much time on a filter you have/you can wipe your mask clean. Many things I had to look up e.g. that you can destroy some doors with attacks, and I did get lost a bit.

All in all, solid 8/10. It's just genuinely a good, enjoyable experience. Shooting mechanics are good, all the stats and numbers are taken out, allowing you to just live the story, and not stress about craft/grind so often found in games. And if it's hostile, you kill it.

The combat system is challenging, forcing the player to think strategically and make every shot count. The use of scarce resources adds a layer of tension to each encounter. The A.I. of the enemies is also noteworthy, as they behave realistically and can catch the player off guard.

The story is engaging, painting a bleak picture of a world struggling to survive. The characters are well developed and the player can sense their desperation and hopelessness. The decision-making mechanic adds an additional level of depth, allowing the player to shape the story in their own way.

Animator Andrii Korzinkin, who worked at developer 4A Games, has died following a combat mission in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The news was confirmed by designer Leonid Stepanov, who worked with Korzinkin at 4A on Metro Exodus before leaving to work at Remedy Entertainment.

""Andrii 'Nizrok' Korzinkin died while performing a combat mission in the struggle for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" wrote Stepanov. A talented animator, incredible person and real hero.""

Korzinkin began his animation career as a 3D animator at Ukrainian studio Pixelation, during which he worked on the TV series Angel Baby. In 2017, he entered the game industry as a senior animator for 4A as it was working on 2019's Metro Exodus. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, Korzinkin voluntarily enlisted into the Ukrainian military.

""Andrii was an awesome human being, very responsive and supportive, always ready to help, incredibly responsible and dedicated person,"" wrote 4A's technical designer Vitalii Keda. ""He always stood out with his dry humor and strive for excellence. [...] You will be missed, dear friend. Rest in peace. Heroyam slava!""

About the game:
The game's atmosphere and unique design choices will make it a worthwhile experience for some, but Metro 2033 suffers from a number of issues (poor implementation of stealth, recurring glitches, etc.).

In Dishonored you had the level design specifically crafted for both stealthy and aggressive approaches, but here, the way it is, it just invites the player to do everything to survive. For example, when it comes to gameplay the crouch is so badly designed, you don't know whether the enemies can see you or not even if you're behind an obstacle - which makes finishing a level in a stealthy way quite difficult.

Now I could deal with some of those aspects, you see?

But I can't deal with the terrible pacing throughout the game; the slow lines of dialog and their deadpan delivery by the voice actors, the long walks of just watching and hearing people speaking to one another.

The vain attempt from the game to try to create a credible atmosphere gets reduced to the graphical fidelity; but it can't only be relegated to that, right? There has to be more to make the world believable and real, and since it's also a game, well, shouldn't the game have its focus in its gameplay and interactions more than in its presentation and story?

At least in the gameplay segments I do believe there's an argument to be made here.

My only complaint is that there are still several level mesh/environment bugs when loading into new areas. Sometimes it flickers, and other times just doesn't show up.

then i got to the boring fucking library which went on for way too long and just when you thought it was over, here come the sewers. stairs up and down and two librarians. repeat ad nauseum.

so i get past that.. and the base. the tunnel with the spoiler weapon. finish that.

gates open. game crashes. i end up back in the library. did it again. crashes again.

no way in hell is the game so good i am playing that section more than twice.
bought the entire trilogy and wanted to experience that, but i guess now i won't.

This was actually my first experience with Metro 2033 I ended up playing the original quite a while after playing this version. Realistically, this is the superior version on a technical level. It runs better, plays much better and doesn't have the bugs and such that the original has as a result of a lack of support.

That being said, there will be people who are peeved at the way certain elements of the originals art-design have been messed with. The game is remastered based on the visuals of Last Light, however not just on a technical level. This game uses a totally different lighting system to that of the original and combined with a lot of new/updated character models, this game has a different identity to that of the original. The old version is much darker and depressing imo, this new version is might brighter and it does contrast in strange ways in certain areas.

It's not gonna be noticeable for most people, but if you're a hardcore fan there will certainly be minor details that will bother you.

Years later in 2014 was released Redux version of the game, technically it’s the same 2033 but with improved graphics. Due to developers notifications said - were improved also AI of the opponents and stealth.

Metro 2033 is one of the few games which I played more then one time. So I played original 2033 version in 2013, then in 2014, after the release I played Redux version. And now I played the console Redux version of the game.

2033 Redux today looks the same good, it’s wonderful game about post-apocalypse. Developers wonderfully showed not only the dark atmosphere but also all nuances and details of the city. Walking through the post-apocalypse Moscow you see city in all details, and you have feeling that it’s real. In some periods of the game it feels not only dark, but as a thriller with some elements of horror. In the game you won’t see screamers, but due to the atmosphere you feel scared to move through location.

The game remained exactly as I remember it from the first playthrough - gloomy, intriguing and addictive. Years past but I still remember how scary I was when used to pass first location alone, and when I first have seen librarian.

About gameplay it’s regular shooter, as Call of Duty, with good plot. But to kill opponents you need not only skill, because one headshot is not enough. It’s really hardcore game, where opponents have much health and you need at least 2 headshots to make a kill. But for me it was not bad, I enjoyed it.

The game has two endings, about which I didn’t know before. To get the good one you need to make good things during the game.

If you only want to get into Metro universe and thinking about playing 2033 or go straight to Exodus version - you definitely need to try the 2033 Redux version. But to understand the plot it is not necessary to play the first part, Exodus has a minimum of references to its predecessors. Rather, it is worth playing in 2033 to expand understanding of the world, which is discussed in the sequels of this universe.",1673692231,1673692231,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

At the height of FPS games (CoD, Battlefield, CSGO etc) you'd think the aiming would be decent, but even at max movement speed it feels sluggish and unresponsive. Mechanics gotta work well in a survivor shooter.

That aside, the game is well paced and segmented with respect to levels and chapters. The plot is fine enough; nothing convoluted or that takes itself too seriously. The sound design is very good; it makes the stealth sections easier to complete since you can hear where enemies are when not in immediate view. Levels are fairly compact and well laid out as expected of a linear shooter game. Supplies are plentiful enough; on Survivor difficulty I was never wanting for ammo or money until the final level (though that is clearly by design).

Just wish the way the game plays and controls were better. It really feels like the game was coded 10 years before it even released. Plus the game frankly isn't critical to play the others. Wouldn't pay above $5 for this.",1673676905,1673676905,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The games take upon the base of Metro and turn it into an intensive, immersive experience. It's a relatively simple and straightforward game as far as mechanics go, but the way everything is broken into chapters/acts is quite fun and gives the player a break between events.

One of the things that stood out to me about Metro 2033 Redux was the attention to detail in the environments and character models. The game does an excellent job of conveying the harsh realities of life in a world that has been devastated by nuclear war. The tense and claustrophobic atmosphere is further enhanced by the use of limited resources and the need to constantly be on the lookout for danger.

This means it has a nasty, low field of view, decent enough graphics with noisy textures and lots of weird post-processing effects and colour-correction, and very okay gunplay.

The story is okay, but many of the philosophical, sci-fi, horror, various other ideas contained within the game are in themselves probably more interesting than the story itself. Artyom's tale is perfectly adequate, though there's some problems with it, such as the game not doing a very good job of explaining what it is your goal actually is, how you intend to go about solving the problem, and how you even obtained the information the leads to the solution at the end of the game. I'm being vague cuz spoilers.

Metro 2033 is a very easy game, I played on Hardcore and it's what I would recommend for new players trying it out for the first time - Ranger mode and Ranger Hardcore mode are both not worth playing because, while I like a lacking HUD for extra immersion and I think the game is somewhat capable of it, it feels very haphazardly implemented because it hides EVERYTHING. Including tutorial prompts, which is very bad for your first time playing, as well as interact prompts. This is problematic if you haven't played the game at least a couple times beforehand and already know every step inside and out.

Aside from difficulty selection, the game is very easy in general. You almost always have an AI partner who will do most of the work for you, and the game only will filter out one or two enemies in a pack to focus you, and those are the only ones you really have to deal with. The amount of loot is pretty ridiculous too, so you'll never really be short of gear so long as you give your surroundings a cursory glance. This didn't really impact my enjoyment.

Since this is in spirit a 360 console shooter, it has all the hallmarks, it has vehicle sections, on rails sections, turret sections, it has all of that stuff. It also has no final boss, as in traditional FPS games - as was the style at the time, in favour of a cutscene.

There's a fair selection of weapons you can pick up through the game, but I felt the balance was a little inadequate, all you really need is the throwing knives and any suppressed weapon to deal with every human enemy in the game silently and efficiently, and for mutants all you need is any shotgun. Even the 'earlygame' duplex will work quite late into the game because they never get stronger, so for the entire game my loadout was the revolver, an AK, and a duplex/shambler/other shotgun. I guess it's fine?

There's only two endings in the game and you can get both of them by just reloading the last checkpoint, basically, and picking the other ending (as far as I know) so uh, that's nice I guess.

Overall it's a perfectly good game and I enjoyed my time playing it, it has a lovely melancholy tone, some good graphics, great accents, and some okay characters kind of. It's worth playing for the story, maybe pick it up on sale if you just really love FPS games and you need a shooter to play.",1673019776,1673019776,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played around 50 hrs on console previously. Its still a game i daydream ,comes up in conversation every now and then.For a game with a grim colour filter, 2010's 2033 was also remarkably pretty. 2014's version is a marked difference. I'm not talking a little texture upgrade here, I'm talking new meshes, new animations and reworked environments/particle effects, improve SSMA,AA etc. Metro 2033 Redux is Metro 2033 tweaked and polished to a high standard making it look still fairly modern in 2020, 'Almost metro exodus'
Amazing as when i played it decade ago on Ps3.
This is definitely a game worth buying, throughout the entire game I didn't spot any bugs or glitches, the enemies are indeed a challenge and combat wise you can modify your weapons and load out to suit multiple play styles. They also balanced the combat so that it isn't just a game full of intense combat making you feel combat fatigued it also offers time for you to look around and explore the world a little  in fallout esque open world feel, some areas are far more linear . but in open area the more inquistive and explorative types they are sometimes rewarded by finding a hidden stash that you may find yourself in desperate need of on the harder levels of difficulty. Ammo is everything in the game, always in short supply. if your a scav. Ammo is currency as it is, what you need to survive, there common and  reloaded grade. and pre war Military Grade Rounds, MGR currency, or sometimes refered to as 'Premium grade or top shelf ammo' is main Money due to its value increasing as its becoming rarer. The value yeilds higher for than gold and silver. , due to good ammunition is held to high value due to that all parts and settlements of metro will always be willing to trade for it.

The story keeps you interested throughout the entire game and they did a good job at building an entire world to immerse yourself in with underground towns and markets to explore even going down to the small details like the blood,rain or radioactive waste splattering against your gas mask if you've just had a close encounter with an enemy or the way it fogs up occasionally or cracks if you were fall over or get stray bullet skims you.. The game also doesn't give much background music instead allowing you to immerse yourself and focus on the sounds in the environment.Expect for 'Stalker campfire' Moments.
Metro has alot to thank For stalker setting alot foundations, but metro expands on stratospheric gameplay, and does far better to modern standard. by far the metro series are one most immersive games ive played 
Moral Points form a hidden system in the Metro video game series that follows Artyom's progress and affects the ending of each game.It is commonly understood that every time Artyom gets a moral point, the screen flashes light blue and whispers or the sound of water dripping can be heard. When Artyom loses a moral point, the screen darkens and an ominous sound can be heard. There are more opportunities to gain moral points than to lose them, and moral points that are gained and lost are speculated to vary in severity. Moral points can be gained through making morally correct decisions, being stealthy in certain levels, but can also be awarded for exploring every part of the map to get weapons and supplies. The best way to gain moral points is to knock out enemies and spare lives when possible - doing so will almost always activate the good endings. This is hidden system for the most part, but note worthy , if not a bit of spoiler.
The crane missions in D6, is still by far,the most annoying/Frustrating moment in the game as you have to raise the crane to full height with very little in the way of instructions (quite buggy), To extract the Coils, fuck that mission.
Melee combat was abit unbalanced as its you Hit slowly with your knife,instead butstock of the gun (4x slower than the enemy).And by the end of the game you will want to create the extinction of the  librarians.

I'm writing this review right after finishing the game for the first time. It's my first time with a Metro series game but because I like a more challenging gameplay I decided on the Ranger Hardcore difficulty which makes the game a little more ""realistic"" having to really manage your resources like ammo, gas mask filters , medkits... Artyom can die very quickly to the point of being one-shot but you also deal more damage to enemies.

It's a game that suits all types of players, those who like a more stealth gameplay or Rambo mode and both can be extremely fun to play. As I was on Ranger Hardcore difficulty I opted for Stealth for most of the game since otherwise I would die every 2 seconds, but the parts where you just shoot everywhere are also incredibly fun.

Also not forgetting the fact that being a Survival Horror this game has an incredible ability to make your heart race with suspense/jump scare moments, or to relieve you with cozy environments or make you freak out because you think a scene would be scary and ends up being relieving.

In the most Metro 2033 Redux is a complete game to please everyone, great setting and graphics for its time, it also does not shy away from the adaptation of the novel by Dmitriy Glukhovskiy, a very calm pace and smooth learning curve.

I played this on my 2017 13'' Macbook Air (really bad for gaming), and i was able to get consistent 40 fps with the lowest graphics setting. 

While some parts can get frustrating at times due to the lack of information given regarding directions (died a few times because of this) and some gameplay mechanics (i wasnt able to figure out how to use throwables until i looked up a guide for it), the immersive gameplay and story makes up for it. Gunplay experience is pretty decent and there a quite a bunch of options when it comes to gun selections, although the customisation options for some guns are kinda lacking. As for the story, you take the role of the (almost) mute protagonist Artyom, as he embarks on a journey to save the people living in the metro system from mysterious creatures called ""The Dark Ones"".

For starters, almost nothing is really explained in regards to controls/difficulty, so it takes some tinkering to figure things out. The story goes places I guess, but from what I've read, while there is a choice it is completely disregarded in the sequel, so is there even a choice?

Graphics don't look that bad, but it's nothing special either. Lens flares are extremely annoying however and it seems that the AI is not affected by your flashlight at all, while they can blind you completely. 

Gunplay is subpar most of the time, and there sometimes seems to be some sort of input lag/delay. Movement also feels extremely janky. It feels like vertical and horizontal sensitivities aren't the same, I could be wrong tho.

All of that I would get over and would even finish this game and probably give it a mixed-positive rating, if it weren't for the level ""Trolley Combat"". Whoever thought this level was a good idea should teach a course ""How to make bad and needlessly frustrating video games"". It's such a bad and annoying level, you die and have no control over the RNG of whether you'll make it through or no. So I stopped playing at that point.

I usually cant be bothered to leave reviews, but this game was so damn good that I felt obligated to show some appreciation to the developers. Note, that this more a rant about how much I love this series rather than an objective review. 

Good Lord, the atmosphere of this entire franchise is just insane. Imo, the metro games are the #1 most atmospheric video game franchise of all time.  Dark, bleak, clostrophobic, underground, melancholic. If you are deciding on whether to buy this, if the atmosphere in the screenshots and gameplay looks like your cup of tea, then you cannot miss out on this one. 

Don't expect this game to have the best FPS mechanics. It's plays just like any other single player FPS and it is linear and not open world. But the game makes it work and there are still plenty to explore in these linear levels. 

Something I wasn't expecting was how much of a tactical FPS experience this game can be. When facing monsters, the gameplay is like any other FPS, but i can be quite intense, because you're often in tight areas, and they are hard to out run. It really makes you feel trapped underground and forced to confront these mutants. However, when facing human enemies, because you can use stealth, one shot them in the head, the gameplay can become basically a horror themed tactical shooter experience, if you choose to play that way, and I think that is amazing. 

This is only game series I know of, that has level of atmosphere, combined with gameplay that while isn't necessarily innovative, provides a duality of both intense slow paced and face paced gunplay, and the option to choose stealth as well. 

If someone were to force me to choose what my favorite video game of all time is, you can bet on me saying its Metro. Happy new year to the Metro developers, I'm very late to say this, but fantastic job on this video game adaptation.

PROS:
-Good plot
-Tense dark levels: the developer cleverly guides the player along a well sculpted linear path.
-A reasonable amount of good first person animations further aid the atmosphere and immersion

NEUTRALS:
-The gunplay is very basic, but sufficient. 
-The original lacked some basic ""quality of life"" features, but the redux version remedies most of those issues

CONS:
-The gameplay mechanics are barely explained. Most are self-explanatory, but a few (like the morality system which dictates the games ending) is never really explained or mentioned at all.

From my experience, Metro 2033 is a quite linear corridor shooter with some sprinkle of open spaced area in between to keep things fresh. Atmosphere and sound design is top notch, immersing you in the storyline and combat.

Gameplay wise, there are not much to say about this game. Nothing quite outstanding in every aspect but in a good way. It might not be the next innovation in this genre but it did everything just right.

Resource wise, you will have to manage a few types. One for crafting filters for mask and weapon upgrades, one for currency that also is higher damage ammo. 
Stealth is not quite great but is a viable option.
Gunplay is okay within your expectation of how weapon behaves in FPS genre.
Graphic wise, it has aged quite well in my opinion. Even from 2022 standard.

Within my playthrough, I have encountered a few problems:
- Some scripted segment have really small room for error. 
- Sometimes, game just drop you in a quite big area and leave you to solve puzzles or looking for next objective on your own. (You have compass that points you to next objective but that's it) Forcing you to trial and error, dying over and over again.

I would totally recommend buying this alongside next 2 sequel in a bundle if you are interested.

I play this game for the maximum dificulty's immersion, and the level design.
I like not having UI, having to swap my items and know wich is equipped by the sound, and check my ammo and which i'm using manually, and i like having the option to go full sneak mode, with 0 kills.

This first-person shooter, set in the ruins of Moscow, will have you fighting for survival against all sorts of creepy crawlies and otherworldly creatures.

But don't let the monsters scare you off - the real thrill of Metro 2033 comes from its immersive atmosphere and rich storytelling. As you journey through the desolate subway tunnels, you'll encounter a cast of memorable characters and uncover the mystery behind the world's downfall.

One thing that really sets Metro 2033 apart is its unique blend of stealth and action gameplay. Whether you prefer to sneak around or go in guns blazing, there's a playstyle for everyone. And with a variety of weapons and upgrades at your disposal, the combat never gets stale.

But be warned - this game is not for the faint of heart. The intense action and heart-pounding moments will have you gripping your controller so tight, you might just break it.

All in all, Metro 2033 is a must-play for any fan of the post-apocalyptic genre. Just make sure you bring plenty of ammo and a sturdy flashlight - you never know what lurks in the shadows.",1672065010,1672065010,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is both amazing and infuriating. For every time my jaw dropped when witnessing the level of detail put into the engine, I spent another cursing the save system or [u]absolute lack of direction or explanation of mechanics[/u]. You have to figure almost every mechanic out by getting stuck and looking up a guide, or dying and learning, ""Well, guess I can't do that. Back to the last checkpoint.""

Will I play the next game in the series? Absolutely. Will I tip the scales of this review into the positive? No. I was annoyed more than engaged.

As far as the Spartan/Survival goes, Spartan is basically an easier difficulty: you get more health, ammo,  filter duration, and a more accurate filter timer. However, [u]even in Spartan, this is not a standard FPS[/u]. Plenty of things will still insta-kill you, and ammo still needs conserved in some levels.

STALKER fans will appreciate the similar world and a number of the same devs. However, remember that this entry in the Metro series is very linear, with more emphasis on story, stealth and survival.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
+Multiple gameplay difficulties
+You can replay levels if you missed something
+Having to watch for and disarm traps was nice
+Stealth mechanics are done pretty well
+The details in carrying Sasha were praiseworthy
+NPC pathing is semi-random
+The moment of choice was nicely done (avoiding spoilers there)

[h1]YMMV[/h1]
~Levels are largely linear
~Many levels have time limits
~Jumpscares
~Occasional quicktime events
~Game loves insta-killing you, even on easier difficulties
~Screw those clipping Demons
~Many environments are fascinating, but you can't actually explore much

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
-[u]Game explains almost no mechanics, and there are plenty[/u]
-Game frequently fails to explain objectives
-Needlessly complicated controls on KB&M
-Checkpoint save system (especially for stealth gameplay)
-Occasional unmarked points of no return
-NPCs frequently talk over one another
-Long, unskippable title screens (can be removed with file edits)
-""Next Page"" diary key can't be changed, making it unusuable if 'F' bound elsewhere
-Enemies can sometimes see or hit you through walls/floors
-Takedown prompt doesn't always appear, ruining everything
-Occasional clipping issues resulting in death or spastic movement
-That final segment of trial and error platforming was incredibly annoying

But at what cost?

Really enjoyed it. Shame I bothered to google how to charge the batteries - holding F - less than an hour before finishing the game, was sure night goggles were just bugged.
On the other hand it amped the difficulty for me, and I very much enjoyed the darkness side of the game.

The downsides of the game are very short lived and don't hinder much from the overall experience of a very immersive dystopia with great horror-ish levels where you just want to reach point B, crawling through whatever corridor you encounter.

Story isn't 100% but is very nice when ignoring the few cliches, most of which the game addresses with humor. Offers some ideologies and a few NPC stories to offer, which I found worthy listening to.

i can play most fps games fine, with the right FOV, pivot, and responsiveness. but this game always has something slightly off that triggers the nausea. Usually if i can't fix it in the settings, i'd just refund the game.

HOWEVER, Metro 2033 is special to me. i bought the original on the Xbox360, and it was love at first play-through. The original Metro 2033 is a cult classic for a reason, its clunky, had weird controls, low budget acting, and the cutscenes are unskippable, on top of the motion-sickness. But back then, no other game made me feel the way this game felt, and that's enough for me to power through.

it has realism. Not realistic, because its not. Metro creates the feel of being fully immersed in the game. You have this mindset to stay alive, not because you die easily, but because just 'being' occupies your attention. This leads to some interesting gameplay, like forgetting to remove my gasmask when i dont need it and not turning my headlamp back on, and so i cant see wth im doing. Also:
[h1] You can shoot your money for maximum firepower!!1 [/h1]

Metro 2033 is the kind of game that you either ""get it"" or you don't. Slight spoilers follow: 
[spoiler]There's 2 endings, but you don't just choose 1 at the end (like the notorious Mass Effect 3 launch.) The game has a mechanic to sort of see how you play the game, and if you check enough boxes, the game gives you the option for the Good ending, otherwise you're stuck with the Canon ending. i'll remember this forever since i felt like i have to earn that ending, or in other words, the game checks to see if i understand enough to deserve the good end.[/spoiler]

Redux is essentially a remaster, mainly to match Metro Last Light's engine. You can change controls now, and the short levels of the original, which were engine limited, are combined into longer levels, so there's less interruption to the story for loading. im not sure if i remember correctly, but i think we couldn't takedown enemies before, which made the original hard as hell. Some players have noted that difficulty changes were made to Ranger mode that are not true to the original.

Overall a pretty positive ""Redux"" its just a shame it didn't really address any motion-sickness issues, or add windowed mode/borderless fullscreen etc. I wouldn't recommend Metro 2033 Redux to just anyone, but it's still a unique experience for the right player.",1670707657,1670726943,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Probably not my type of game - you just have to sneak and sometimes you shoot something, but you have to manage your ammo constantly which is a giantic pain in the butt. When you actually get to do some shooting, you mostly shoot the same thing over and over again. The most irritating fact about it is that enemies have awful animations overall, and they almost never react to getting shot and when they do it looks so janky you're not sure if they are staggered or dead so you're constantly at risk of either wasting ammo or getting hit for free by enemy.

I love this game, and I own it on Playstation, GOG, Humble Bundle, and steam.
I have played it on Windows, Linux, and PlayStation.
This review will be based around Linux/Windows, and then I will add stuff from the other gameplays into it.

Storyline: 5 out of 5
This game has a remarkable story, and as I understand it, these games are based on 2 Russian books called metro 2033 and Metro 2035. Metro Exodus is the only game that is not based on a book; if I recall right.
I like how you are following the main protagonist for the whole game series. The main protagonist Is the youngest and newest member. He unofficially became a Ranger when Hunter assigned him his first mission to get to Polis to find Miller.

Design: 4 out of 5
You can see and feel it a Russian game, but it works well, and since it's happening in Russia, that makes it so much better. I like how they make you feel afraid when you in the dark or when you have to sneak around and turn off the light to keep hitten. Also, they have an excellent light effect that makes the game even more emerged.

Mechanics: 4 out of 5
I like the mechanic I mostly play this game with a controller, even on pc, and rarely do I find an FPS game fun and good with a controller. The only other game I can remember is Halo.

Music and Voice Acting: 4 out of 5
The music is good even if i don't listen that much to it, but the voice acting is a triple A game worthed.
I love the voice acting in the first two games. I'm not too fond of the voice acting in Metro Exodus. It doesn't feel as smooth and natural as in these first two games, and it feels kind of force. All the jokes they make feel forced on you in Metro Exodus, and it makes the game brah.

System: 4 out of 5
The system is simple, and it works. It doesn't try to be somthing it's not, and it gives you a lot of options to customize your weapons the way you want them. I am a silencer kind of guy i want to be as silent as i can when i shoot and take people down without noise. i also like that you are paying with army grade bullets since they are hard to get your hands on, so they are worth a lot. It's also cool that you need to recharge your batteries and re-pump your deadly bb-gun. Or how the light is hurting the spiders. Thats a nice touch that make them deadly but at the same time give you a fighting chance to kill them.

Conclusion 5 out of 5
my overall Conclusion is this game even if it from 2014 is still one of the best game in 2020/21 i feel like too many shitty games is getting out and to many don't see the quality and don't mind playing shitty games and still rate them high, but this game deserves to be ranked high, and i want to see more games like this where people put their soul into the game and want to make a game that is worth playing and people love to come back to or love to own more copies of it. 

If you play this game on Linux, i would recommend the steam version. It's more optimize and runs better I was playing this game on Proton 5.13, and I have to say it was running better than on windows and loads on 0-3 sec. One time I had pushed X before the screen was even loaded. That how fast it can load, and that's on an M.2 SSD.

[b] Is it worth your time? [/b]
Yes, this game isn't without it's flaws, but it's a hell of a fun ride with lots of unique moments, and a rich backstory based off the novels by the same name. Furthermore it's the first in the series out of three, which I highly recommend playing in order. 

[b] What are the pros? [/b]
Challenging but not impossible to play with a couple different difficulty options depending on your preference. Great gunplay - the firearms and other weapons feel impactful and snappy, and have different customization options. Ammo is scarce but not impossible to find depending on which gameplay style you choose (I chose ""Spartan"" meaning more available ammo) you have to consider each shot you take, but there's still room for some spray and pray. The story is immersive and draws you in, there are several ""just one more level"" moments, and as mentioned before the lore is well established due to the novels. Though I didn't, there are multiple playthrough options with different available endings if you enjoy replaying a game a few times to try it out.

[b] What are the cons? [/b]
This may be me personally but I HATE the checkpoint system, the fact that you can't quicksave is huge drawback for me - not a dealbreaker by any means but still annoying. I did notice that even at ""Normal"" difficulty the game is pretty challenging, this didn't bother me at all, but I'm listing it as a con because there are only two options for your playthrough - normal and hardcore; I think every game should have an easy option for someone who wants to play more for the story less for the challenge. Also, this may be me nitpicking a bit but the game utilizes a compass system to navigate, meaning you have to literally take it out to see which direction you need to go and holster your weapon in the process, I hated this but some people find it immersive, so take that one as more of a neutral less of a con depending on your style of play.

[b] TLDR [/b]
It's fun, story is great, gunplay is great, navigation and checkpoint system are not my my favorite, but it didn't ruin the experience. Pick it up on sale, you wont regret it.",1670080424,1670080505,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u]Story[/u]

After a short introduction to the world of Metro and what's to come, Metro 2033 starts off in the Exhibition, a Metro Station that Artyom (the game protagonist) lives in. After a short walk through the station, you meet up with Hunter, a Ranger who is a part of the Spartan Order, a group of elite battle hardened soldiers that roam the wasteland.

Slight spoilers for the purpose of explaining the start of the story:
[spoiler]Shortly after an attack, you find out there is a lot more to the problem at hand than originally thought. Afterwards you're tasked with finding a man named Miller, in the event that Hunter does not return. You then set out on a journey to find Colonel Miller.[/spoiler]

The story is very well written, and gives you an immersive experience that puts you right in the heart of Russia's Metro twenty years after the nuclear war. You get to experience first-hand what life in the Metro is like, and must do what you can to survive the harsh environments, avoiding both mutants and human enemies alike.

[u]Characters / Relationships[/u]

Every single character is unique and genuine in their personalities. The relationships between Artyom and the rest of the characters you meet along the way were all well-written and developed throughout the entirety of the game. Every person you come across on your journey serves a different purpose to help you get to where you're supposed to be. Miller plays an especially important role for Artyom, and reaching him is your goal throughout the first half of the game. Artyom bonds with each character on a different level, and some stick around longer than others. The rest of the Order who serve under Colonel Miller all have an incredible bond, and they act more like brethren than fellow soldiers. This is portrayed throughout the game and was very well developed.

[u]Gameplay / Mechanics[/u]

Being the first game in the franchise, it set the foundation for what we all came to love.

The gameplay is absolutely astonishing. You're put in the deep end of the gritty, dark metro, with little to no supplies. Survival is only possible if you scrounge for resources, such as ammo, medkits, filters, throwables and of course MGRs, which are military grade rounds. Not only are they used for that little bit of extra punch when attacking enemies, they're also the main currency of Metro 2033.

Throughout the world of Metro, there are locations in which Artyom can buy and trade several things. Ranging from weapons, medkits, throwables, filters and of course ammunition. (All of which are bought using MGRs, so searching for supplies is a must!)

The game also allows you to handle the majority of the levels using stealth. While you of course can't stealth levels which are against monsters, almost all levels which have humans in them can be finished using stealth.

[u]Graphics / General Environment[/u]

For the year this game came out, it is still absolutely stunning to look at. They really captured the dark, dingy and eerie atmosphere of the Metro tunnels, and gave you a small glimpse into the Russians' world of poverty and survival. The few times you're able to leave the Metro and explore the surface, you see it is desolate, and crawling with mutants created by the vast levels of radiation. The developers really paid attention to detail, for no two bodies you come across are the same. They went above and beyond to create individual and believable remains throughout the game, and nothing appeared to be copy-pasted. This added to the believability of the nuclear war, and just how powerful radiation can be.

Spoilers:
[spoiler]The D6 Bunker you are tasked with finding was mapped out phenomenally. The attention to details the developers paid attention to did not go unnoticed, for this bunker is one of a kind, and extremely realistic looking to what you'd expect of an actual underground bunker.[/spoiler]

[u]Enemies / Monsters[/u]

You come across a variety of enemies and monsters throughout the game. (Will mark for spoilers in case you don't want to know about them before playing).

[spoiler]This can range from Demons (mutated bats), to Watchmen (these appear to be giant rats, although they're more canine like in the sense they travel in packs). You will also come across shadow people, which are ghost-like silhouettes of those who have perished either on the surface or in the Metro. They add to the eerie and sad atmosphere of the overall game. Aside from mutants, you also come across bandits, Fascists, and Nazis that you must face in combat.[/spoiler]

[u]Missions / Side Quests[/u]

Metro 2033 follows a linear path, where you don't get any side quests to follow. You're given main missions that further progress the game. Playing the game at a slower pace can allow you to fit more dialog than if you played it to just finish the game.

[u]Game Modes / Difficulties[/u]

Each game mode is different from one another. In total the game has the following four modes: Easy, Normal, Hardcore and Ranger Hardcore which is also known as Stalker Mode.

I personally played through Hardcore and Ranger Hardcore most as I enjoy the franchise the most that way. The resources are scarcer while the enemies hit harder, but so do you! Stealth really shines on higher difficulties, but the loud approach isn't out of the equation as long as you use everything at your disposal. All difficulties are enjoyable to play through, and it is entirely possible to take a stealth approach, a loud approach, or a combination of both in every single game mode available, so be sure to read the in-game description and choose the one you prefer the most!

[u]Achievements / Replayability[/u]

Achievements in this game are absolutely fun to collect. If you're aiming to get all the achievements and 100% the game, you'll have to play through the game multiple times. The replayability due to that alone is great. Some achievements are based on stealth, not being seen, killing or knocking someone out, while some are based on the amount of people killed. They're specifically challenging to get on higher difficulties, but fun. You'll enjoy getting them no matter what difficulty you're on or how you play the game.

[u]Voice Acting / Sounds[/u]

The sound effects were done extremely well, especially when paired with the naturally eerie environment of the Metro. The voice acting was done phenomenally, and they had quite a few well known voice actors. (Steve Blum, Kirk Thorton, and Yuri Lowenthal, for example).

[u]Alternate Endings[/u]

There is one alternative ending for this game. Whether you get the original ending or the alternative one is entirely dependent on your choices throughout the game. Each choice has a severe impact on the overall outcome of the game, which adds to the immersion that you are essentially living out Artyom's life for him. While both endings are good, I personally prefer the original ending (which is the canonical ending).

[u]Conclusion[/u]

First installment, but should be in everyone's library. The game is absolutely spot on in every aspect. The developers care about the game, especially as it is based off the Metro 2033 book written by Dmitry Glukhovsky. I definitely recommend buying Metro 2033!",1596745532,1669150577,True,14,0,0.678024947643280029,0,True,False,False

Eu queria muito gostar desse jogo, meu objetivo era zerar os 3, mas esse aqui não tem como. To ligado que ele fez história quando lançou e muita gente gosta mas eu acho essa gameplay dele horrível e sem querer ficar metendo muito pau, mas a história n me agrada muito também. A sonorização é bem triste, controles são travados, os combates são pouco impactante e frequentes demais e o jogo tem um costume desnecessário em ficar te zoando com coisas irritantes (tipo bater a cabeça na parte do trem). Eu to negativando pq essa review é sobre a minha opinião, mas eu acho que pre ser justo devo dizer que esse (até onde eu sei) é o primeiro game de renome dessa dev, ele tem seu charme e com as melhorias gráficas do redux, a atmosfera é bem boa. Não posso dizer que não vale a pena o teste, mas eu n gostei...",1643841883,1668826745,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

The Good
 - gameplay is solid
 - sound is great. Gunfire, sound effects, voiceovers 
 - characters feel fleshed out

The Not so Good
 - companion AI is wonky due to the game being released a while ago. enemies attack only you and companions are slow to aid at parts
 - the game doesn't hold your hand nor does it have modern day comforts like quest markers, quest pathing, or minimap. This led to some confusion at times but I felt it added to the charm. I can see where others would not enjoy that though.

Artyom's desperate, haunting voyage through the irradiated remains of Moscow is every bit as engaging today as it was when it first released back in 2010, and this Redux version benefits massively from overhauled AI, gameplay mechanics and visuals. In terms of first-person shooters or survival horror games on PC, this is one of the very best.

A valuable remake that makes the original Metro feel complete on PC.

I have to be honest. The first encounter I had with Metro was years ago, when I had no idea of the franchise and thought of Metro: Last Light as a standalone title. Well, as it turned out, it was the second of a series and while I was a little confused sometimes, it actually already explained to me what happened in this one. This might also be the reason, why it took me years to play the first one, and I have to say... it wasn't really necessary.
There is literally nothing in the story that is new or interesting if you have played the second part first. The pacing is very weird, with sometimes being too slow and other times too fast. To explain, you are constantly with new people who you just met. All they do is slow you down until they die far too early, so it's not even dramatic. Why? Because I just met those people! It feels like the game wants those deaths to have an impact on you, but I don't even remember their faces half the time.
Which brings me to the next part. Sure, it's an old game, I get that. But if your graphics are limited. Give the characters some special features, so I can recognize them. I think there are only 2 of the dozens of people I met that I could recognize immediately. Which sucks if they tell you to follow someone else...
Anyway, the game looks pretty good and detailed for its age if you forget about the faces (and the children). But there is so much focus on companions that it's still only one point on graphics for me.
There is a similar problem with the sound design. While the ambiance and music is absolutely superb, the voice acting is more mediocre. Which, again, sucks when meeting new characters is literally a thing every 5 minutes.
The game-play theoretically was fine. It just felt really clunky. For an old game, that's nothing special, but in this case, it was somewhat bothersome when the game wants you to fight big hordes of enemies. Most times, I felt like I'll just have to tank it while reloading.
In any case. Considering, Metro 2033 is over a decade old. It's not a bad game. It's just not really needed any more. Everything this game does is done better by Last Light and you don't even need the story part either. So if you want to play it you can, but I would recommend to just start with Metro: Last Light.
Whatever you do. Thanks for reading and I hope it helped :)",1668536956,1668536956,False,1,2,0.470588237047195435,0,True,False,False

The only people who survived were the ones who sought shelter underground. In Moscow, Russia, a lot of people fled in to the metro stations. Due to the radiation on the surface, they had no choice but to make the metro their new home.

The game takes place 20 years after the Last War. You play as Artyom, a young man who lives in one of the stations, Exhibition (which is VDNKh station in real life). Life in the metro is hard. The war may be over, but underground new and old wars continue. Besides poverty, there are conflicting political ideologies, corruption, greed, irrational fear of one another and violence. Will humanity ever learn? On the surface the situation isn't much better. Due to the radiation, you cannot even go outside without a gas mask. On top of that, it is now swarming with dangerous, hungry mutants, with the latest threat being the Dark Ones...

Initially, this game attracted me, because I have traveled a bit through Russia myself and have seen and visited many of the locations in it. Whoever made use of the Moscow Metro knows that the stations are works of art; almost like mini-museums. Here in this game not so much. They are still impressive, but in a much darker and sadder way. Other things that appealed to me, after playing the game, are the subtle 'moral points' that you receive for 'doing the right thing' (although, admittedly, in this game that often means eavesdropping on random conversations between NPCs or simply exploring every nook and cranny) and this will even determine which ending you will get. I also really enjoyed Artyom's internal monologue between levels, as his way of thinking resonated with me.

However, I do have some critique as well. I play with an X-Box controller and it took me way too long to figure out all the buttons. I had to search for help online. It wasn't always clear to me where I needed to go either and on the surface that is a problem, since your gas mask runs out of air when you run out of filters. Sometimes I had to speed-run through a level and - as someone who plays like a turtle and likes to enjoy his surroundings - I did not enjoy that (although I am better now with managing my filters). Last but not least, I actually do have some mild critique concerning those 'moral points'... [spoiler]The 'good ending' isn't canon with the Metro series. The 'bad ending' is. So that basically means you have to sabotage your 'clean' playthrough in order not to be confused when you start [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067384854/recommended/287390/]Metro: Last Light[/url]).[/spoiler] Oh, and the English voice acting for little children is bad... really bad.

Overall, I recommend this exciting and atmospheric game, but compared to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067384854/recommended/287390/]Metro: Last Light[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067384854/recommended/412020/]Metro Exodus[/url], I do consider this the least in the series.

The immersion in these games is simply perfect, from the way you interact with your equipment, wiping off your gas mask, charging your flashlight, and the like, to scratching on your lighter and burning cobwebs as mutated spiders scurry around in the darkness, and your breath steams up your gas mask. The gameplay might not be for everyone, but it most certainly was for me, and I love how unapologetically it sticks to its vision, which makes it stand out all the more. The plot is deep, sad, but tinged with hope, showcasing the sheer stubbornness of the human spirit, and does an incredible job of adapting the novel which is one of the best pieces of post-apocalyptic fiction I've read, and you can really see the passion the devs put into every inch of this game. Metro 2033 is simply amazing, a game where worldbuilding, immersion, atmosphere and writing all melt together into a superb, cohesive whole, and if that isn't worth your time, I really don't know what is.",1667649543,1667649543,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The atmosphere, unusual weapons, the story, enemies, wonderful graphics, fantastic characters and many more. Yeah you could say, ahhh there are many other games that are better than this one, but METRO has something that makes you love it (all of them). I think Half Life is very similar franchise, because people who love it see more than just a good story, characters etc., those games have truly something more to it. The ""feel"". I've played a lot of games, not just on pc but also on xbox and playstation (all combined, more than 200), however none of them made me write a review or tell anyone to go and buy it immediately. This is my first and probably the last review and I'm glad that it's the METRO franchise that's getting the pleasure. If you can't choose between 2033, Last Light and Exodus, I can tell you that all of them are fantastic games and you should get them in the bundle, but if you just want to try it, I would go for the 2033, because it's the first chronologically. METRO Last Light has more guns, boss fights and is longer, but on the other hand, METRO 2033 is darker, which helps the atmosphere and the horror site of the game. Metro Exodus is something else completely, because it leaves the cramped spaces of the Moscow metro and decides to take the, nowadays, more popular route of the open world genre by being composed of a few semi open world areas. It still manages to keep the ""feel"" of the previous games, but I personaly just couldn't help but feel that something was off throughout the entirity of my playthrough. It has some nice ideas such as the new backpack feature or the weapon jamming, but I would honestly be happy to see METRO get back to the roots of the first two games. 

Well, I think that's it for this kinda review, which is more just saying how good the franchise is and not telling you the pros and cons, but that's exactly what I wanted to write.

From it's first moments you will be blown away by just how much attention to detail there is when interacting with the world and viewing it through your characters perspective.  

FPS games that take full advantage of their perspective to immerse the player are few and far between and it's a shame as it's one of the genre's biggest advantages.  Some standouts like the Stalker Franchise really drive the point home, going almost for a simulation feel.  It just so happens that the Metro series was developed by part of the team behind Stalker, and it plays like it.  2033 is a great first entry to the series and basically gives us a taste of what a linear Stalker game could be. Despite losing a lot of what makes Stalker great, it doesn't hurt the experience, it is equally as enthralling in it's own way.  I like to think that Metro is to Stalker as Rage is to Fallout 3+, or as Arx Fatalis is to Elder Scrolls if you like.

Metro 2033 is an extremely tightly crafted linear FPS that has the feel of an Immersive Sim in some respects, and a survival horror game in others, which is an awesome combination.",1667017088,1667017088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The diversified characters would be a good example that immediately caught my eye. The old Metro 2033 had a lot of recycled human models, which made it feel a bit unrealistic and sterile. 

However, the moment I started the game, I missed Artyoms old voice. His whiny, despair filled voice was so much more fitting to the setting of the game imo. And I feel similar about the new soundtrack. I get the impression the developers tried to focus more on western audiences instead of the source material, because the overall vibe of the game now reminds me more of other titles like Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Not that this is a bad development, I just think it takes away from what made this game unique and immersive.

One major flaw I have to point out tough is that this game struggles with UWQHD monitors, meaning is stretches and distorts the picture depending on where I look at. If for example a human model stands right infront of me, it gets squished and looks almost a bit like a twig. If I view the same model from the edge of my monitor tough, it has the proper proportions again. So far I found no way to fix this issue, and only Metro 2033 redux has it, the other games in the series run fine.

Edit: the distortion and stretching on my monitor disappeared after some time, altough I cannot pinpoint a particular action or event that cleared the issue. It just appeared to have fixed itself when I started the game one day. 

Overall, I do not regret getting this game a second time (it was on sale), and I can recommend it to any Metro/Stalker fan.",1650748541,1667007667,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The stealth. I've heard you can not kill a single person in this game. That's not my experience. I can't figure out stealth in this game. Enemies from a distance can see you more easily than the ones I'm doing circles around at times. By doing circles, I mean that literally. I duck around and circle them praying the Knock Out prompt will appear. It rarely does. Time to kill people again.

Hitting shift when I press W as I want to run often brings up the Steam overlay. This happens in no other games I've played, but is a lot of fun in combat. LOTS.

The lack of instruction in this game is a joke. Seven hours in before I found on Google how to get to your journal. There isn't even a key bind option for this (if IDK what key something is, I go to the controls in options.) After that, I finally figured out how to charge your flashlight, as they don't tell you this. Inventory? Yep. Another 8 hours as the controls don't tell you to hold Tab down for a few seconds. I was pressing it, as one would assume. They also don't tell you that your map isn't a compass, but a wayfinder. The first few times I tried it, North(ish) was coincidentally the direction I needed to go. An e-manual would've been nice. I don't believe anyone should ever need to go online to find the basic instructions of a game. 

The game crashes. A lot. Of the hundreds of hours I've gamed this year, this is the only one I've actually lost saves on.

The story is pretty good, but unfortunately it's not done well. There wasn't enough about the Dark Ones to fully flesh them out. Side characters were ok. This is minor, as they're trying to condense a book into a short game.

Oh....The Librarians. Stand your ground, maintain eyesight, and move slowly away if approached. Half the time they just attacked for no reason. Funny though, they did no damage. It was more of a nuisance trying to get around them though.

There are positives to this game that every reviewer on here has gone on about. I just wanted to list some of the problems that are often appearing, yet not talked about. It's just another poorly made game that the devs have no intention of fixing. This, along with no instructions have been staples of declining quality in games that's not slowing down.

It's certainly not a bad game, but it's not a great one either. Immersion is impossible when you can't stop critically thinking, due to the bugs. This was every experience with stealth. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it.",1666810945,1666811285,False,1,1,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,False

It may be slightly on the short side but thats to be expected for what it is. That being a linear but tense and atmospheric experience. My favourite levels were the above ground ones where it felt even more tense due to a time restraint on filters for your gas mask. I had to restart one level and be more strategic because I didnt have enough filters to see out the end of the level. Some people might be annoyed by this as Ive seen it mentioned but I enjoyed the challenge. There were a couple of bugs and crashes to desktop on both this and Last Light, moreso in the latter, which is a direct continuation of this game. I bought these games super cheap and they were worth every penny.

I had some questions about the difficulty options as there are many, so what I did was do my inital playthrough on Spartan Hardcore, and subsequent on Survival Ranger Hardcore, which was a fantastic experience knowing the layout of the levels and controls. I did the exact same with Last Light. Two playthroughs are required for completion if you are that way inclined and starting the game on Ranger Hardcore would guarantee some unnecessary deaths and frustrations due to not knowing where items are placed in the menus and certain moments in the game where its necessary to mash the interact button, without the prompts on normal or hardcore mode it would be impossible to know when playing on Ranger mode.

It took me about 75 hours to complete both games including the DLC on Last Light but I like to take my time and enjoy the experience and soak up the atmosphere. Im currently halway through the first book which is also fantastic and the game holds through to the story in large part.

Anyways, thats my 2c. Enjoy this game and dont put it off for so long like I did. Im gonna take a break and read the rest of the books before diving into Exodus. I really am looking forward to that.",1666729161,1666729580,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To preface I've never played the original metro 2033 so I can't compare the two but I had a great time with this game. The gameplay can either be fast with lots of gunfire and pipe bombs or slow and methodical with throwing knives and silent unconventional weapons, hell you get an achievement for killing every person on a level and another achievement for not killing anyone on the same level, made the gameplay a different experience the second time around. The gameplay can have some real tension too, certain enemies on certain levels can just be terrifying, whether it's darting around trying to find the little creatures sprinting everywhere through holes in the wall or being chased by the gorilla-esque librarians that take shotgun shell after shotgun shell. The weapon choices are pretty preem too, except the bastrd gun, it's awful but everything else is pretty cool and can offer some difference in how you approach a fight and each with their own level of upgrades or modifications, not as much as I would like but last light and exodus improve on this.
Speaking of the other metro games I should mention the story. It's pretty alright, maybe one of the weaker parts of the game, I haven't read the books the story is based off of but it can be a little repetitive but ultimately worth it as gameplay and story fit almost seamlessly, like iced tea and lemonade or authority and corruption. I won't spoil any of the story but it's definitely interesting at times and by the end it's actually thought provoking, it's worth it for the gameplay if nothing else but more importantly it sets up the sequel: Metro Last Light, which builds on the story and gameplay in much more interesting ways. All in all, a great pick for a long weekend and worth it if you find it on sale with the others, worth it on it's own too but last light and exodus are big improvements. Solid 8/10, read more reviews and watch a video if you're still unsure.

Some weird hitboxes here and there, transparent stairs, bulletproof curtains, you know, the usual.
But still... AWESOME game.
I tend to take that stuff seriously and judge harshly for them, but here I just couldn't help myself but laugh it off.
Those flaws pale in comparison to the track record of this series

The world feels so alive, with the setting respected and maintained expertly in all visual and gameplay aspects.
The direction you look matters, NPCs will react to you naturally, and their dialog hits that exact line of relevance to you as a player and believability.
No two gun shops have the same dialog, everyone has their style and circumstances.
Immersion is not something you have to worry about here, at all.
Ranger mode is incredibly interesting to struggle in, ammo management is a must, and hitting heads and timing shots are essential to survive, let alone having spare ammo at the end.
Stealth is simple but sharp, one mistake can quickly turn a flawless run around into a disaster.

One small problem I have with this game is the chain of companions you go through.
While making a semblance of sense in the story, felt really contrived and called upon all the luck in the knows universe.

The writing is incredible and holds up a solid image, unafraid to reach into the important questions, the questions this game is all about.

Your choices MATTER.
Your actions MATTER.
Even the ones not presented neatly with a 'good' and 'bad' option.


What makes you human?
Why is your life worth more than the people at the end of your muzzle?


note that both games suffer from rare game breaking bugs and save errors that force full reloads and/or other fun save trickery to resolve.
if you notice anything odd, look it up and hope you can still salvage the last 5 hours of gameplay...

This is a lightly edited version of my metro last light review but I stand by it, the games are very similar, the redux especially makes them feel like an absolutely massive DLC to each other more than 'another game'.",1665764600,1666424915,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- could run a bit smoothly but the aiming felt off like i was a robot.
- textures overlapping in some parts of the game, also enemies getting clipped in the wall with one hard shotgun in the face.  
-1 Hard crash (turns of the device) a few game crash to the Steam HUD/UI But this is game braking.

I love the gunplay these Metro games have, all weapons feel fantastic. There is weight to the combat, it feels amazing to shoot people and monsters. Decent story. I had fun even on my 3rd playthrough for the 100%.

The game is kind of realistic, except for those armored blokes who can take like 5 headshots and 1-2 grenades under their feet and still survive. I fucking hate these in all shooters. If it is some kind of monster or some unknown creature being that resilient, ok you can justify that, but a regular ass human eating 5 headshots, multiple grenades, there is no armor that can withstand that, not even 1 headshot, let alone 5. And the grenade? Yeah no, especially not in this setting... it boils my blood every time devs do this.

The other thing I don't really like is the stealth, it is great that there is the option to do it but imho it doesn't work (at least for me). I have yet to play a game with decent stealth, not even in games dedicated to it.

I am 65.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.",1666038952,1666038952,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Literally, the mutants can take either 1-2 shotgun blasts to the face (2-4 with the AK) or randomly they'll need 6, despite looking identical to the others, therefore giving me no indication that they're supposed to be a stronger version or some dumb bs lmao

The post-apocalyptic stature is shown extremely accurately. The story was amazing and had a very unique plot. The Negative points are most likely because Devs must have wanted the game to look more immersive and real. Rest assured it was an amazing game - 8.5/10 from me.

My dislikes are : 
1. No extensive UI : You don't know how much health you have, where your next objective is, how much oxygen you got.
2. There's no way we can read what NPCs told us afterwards. If you missed the conversation, then you can never know what was the hint or objective given by NPC. Lack of manual save sometimes put us in weird situation, For example - I was on the surface where oxygen is really crucial. I didn't knew I was running out of oxygen (no UI) and checkpoint was saved. Shortly after that, I was stuck in a loop where ""reload last checkpoint"" gave me only 30 seconds of OXYGEN to survive. (Had to restart the game to make it right)

From level design to graphics and story / characters this game has it all! I really enjoy scrounging what I can and having that survival feeling. Music fits perfectly and the game flows just as it feel it would. You really have to give credit where it is due. 

The only thing I truly hope is worked on is the sound of Artium, or whoever may be the MC of the game, walking around. I get what they were going for, but it just doesn't sound right to me. Its a weird nit pick but honestly, it truly is the only thing that sticks out and I find myself calling out. This should go without saying, but don't let this stop you from enjoying one of the greats. Seriously, I really think this series stands as a gaming giant. A series to get others into gaming as a hobby. 

Although Metro does give off a slower burn kind of game, it throws you in right from the jump, then slows for a second to set up the story. You may run your two hours up before you know it. Not that I think you'll refund, but something to keep in mind.

One thing I love about the Metro games is that each station has tons of personality to it. It's not limited to depressing, woe-is-me sadness porn, although there is plenty of that, it also shows people trying to live and find happiness among the dark. Puppet shows for kids, brothels, salesmen showing off their wares, old photos of the surface pre-nuclear war lining the walls, these are the things you're protecting when you plunge into the terror waiting metres outside the walls - human or otherwise. All the human villains have the sympathetic side to them of being piss-terrified of dying in a desperate struggle for survival.

You occasionally go to the surface, which is also really fucking cool. Firstly it's nuclear winter, not nuclear fallout, so the aesthetic is different. The mechanics like gas mask canisters, wiping the visor, the creatures that have adapted to the surface better than you, it all makes you feel like you're absolutely 100% out of your fucking depth, like you really don't belong on the surface anymore. 

But also, the Fallout series and games like it have wrong a lot out of a nuclear apocalypse in the US, but there's something very alien about exploring Moscow - complete with some faithful recreations of popular locations, like the Library, or some boring old suburbs. It was inhabited by people seen to be the ""villains"" of the Cold War (really they're just people born on one side instead of the other), driven by the same kind of national pride that fuelled the West. And now here we are, walking among the ruins, seeing it from the perspective of someone who mourns the loss of it just like we would a non-Eastern Bloc country. There's no us and them, there's just us. It's a weird and unique feeling when you play through it for the first time. And, the enemies in the Library are terrifying and awesome.

There are also subtle supernatural elements in the metro. The thing that stands out to me is the contrast between highly industrial, cooperate, metropolitan environments and weird supernatural stuff. Inexplicable phenomena happening within a perfectly, mathematically planned subway. It's is very engaging, although I must say that, the main story notwithstanding, the game (and Last Light, too) doesn't really seem interested in explaining or even hinting at why and how all of this is happening. The mystery and ideas alone might be enough to satisfy you, but I view it the same way as a JO sesh of edging for an hour while looking for good material and then just giving up and not finishing. The lack of payoff retroactively dampens everything beforehand.

However, there's a lot about the stealth that annoys me. Firstly, a lot of rooms have a single very video gamey solution to them, in that it literally has a very clear winding path of shadow to follow in order to stay hidden from enemies. The core of good stealth gameplay is using the tools the game gives you to manipulate the environment and behaviour of enemies. seeing rooms so obviously laid out to skip that step kind of ruins my immersion. No self-respecting murderous gang would leave their defences so open. 

As for the tools with which you manipulate your environment, I would have liked there to be more. There's the classic throwing objects to attract attention to where you aren't, stealth takedowns (thankfully not pre-animated), but nothing stands out as the game's equivalent of Metal Gear Solid's cardboard box, say. There are pneumatic weapons for silent takedowns that spice things up in raw combat, but a), an AK with a silencer does the same job, is easier to get ammo for and easier to use in more situations (no pumping to reload, etc.) and b), I think stealth is far more interesting when you don't actually massacre everyone. Call me a big old stick-in-the-mud, but human life is valuable, especially in the apocalypse. The player-character being both underpowered because they don't give in to the power-hungry violence of other factions and also because they're just better at it fits a lot more into the vibe the story is going for. Also, it's fun to imagine enemies who have realised they've been stealth'd jumping up and down in frustration afterwards. They can't do that if they're all on the ground whistling through the holes in their heads.

Also, since you're underground most of the time, the visibility isn't great. Grey and black straps and jackets against grey and black concrete, that sort of thing. Floodlights/flashlights in stealth areas are often blinding, too, which makes it hard to make out where exactly an enemy's head is - and consequently whether they'll die with a single lovetap or call all of their friends because you shot their shoulder. Shooting them out also alerts everyone, fair enough, but that means that it's annoyingly hard either way. There are night vision ACOG sights, but they're not particularly pretty. You can only change them out at stations, so there's no way of knowing if you're going to be viewing the next fun action setpiece through an ugly, potentially blinding green haze if the area is well lit (since that's how night vision works) or spraying from the hip the whole time. I'll pass on both counts, thanks.

Generally, the game needs more discipline around communicating enemy paths and actions and locations.  The gold standard for this, as always, are the Thief games. The guard's footsteps are loud because they're armed and don't care about hiding. The rooms are well lit. The floor types change the amount of noise you make (a rug, wood, hard floors) and you can tell which is which by sight and sound. Knowing all those factors and working around them should be where the challenge originates. A decent chunk of my progression in stealth areas was trial and error until I knew enough about it beforehand to get through. Not all of it, it's mostly functional, but it's there.

The atmosphere and setting, I think, are definitely worth the price of admission. Actually, after writing all this out I wanna replay it, so I'm gonna go do that. Bye.",1663465334,1663465334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall – Metro 2033 may have been a fantastic game upon release…. But playing it over a decade later, it hasn’t aged well. The game feels incredibly clunky, it has a ton of game-breaking bugs…still…the game was fortunately pretty short and hopefully the series improves with each release.  Recommended if you’re planning to play the series as a whole.

The shooting is solid, headshots matter with all enemies and those knife kills.. oh god. Feels good to play especially since you feel like you are managing a tactical suit without absurd menus.

The Story:
I love the depressing/scary take on post apocalypse compared to the goofy antics of Fallout. There are funny moments but it doesn't feel out of place.

The Visuals:
A big revamp from the original 2033 which looked literally dry by comparison. If it isn't explicitly stated this is on a remake level of upgrade.

The Sound:
The guns sound crisp, the voice acting is on point, the music is perfectly somber and it helps set it's mood very well.


The Experience:
Great story based game. Some quality of life things like skippable scenes would be nice. Also a windowed fullscreen would do wonders as alt tabbing causes it to crash, otherwise excellent game.",1621936052,1663211101,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's an alright game. The atmosphere is good, the gunplay is mediocre, and the graphics hold up enough. 

But... the characters are all boring and expendable, graphics tend to be quality mismatched and flat, gun accuracy and impact aren't the best, the game has a tendency to not teach things like recharging battery, lighting is frankly pretty bad, maps and story can be sometimes hard to navigate and I kept not knowing what I was supposed to be doing, this has an odd amount of magical content that just doesnt fit in, and the pacing my god, talk about a fucking slog, there isn't enough content or story to back this game up so most of the time it's a walking/horde simulator.

Idk, would I recommend it? Sure, it's not horrible, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a lot of patience and aren't looking for anything engaging.",1663187443,1663188551,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have heard it criticized as a series of sub stories touched on but unexplored, the narrator dragged away after a glimpse, and I would argue that that is the point, it is an odyssey and a cross-section of the world. 

Gameplay is good, though it felt simultaneously too easy and overwhelming (I mow through enemies with ease and then get a pack of nosalisis that I feel can't be addressed cleanly by even a skilled player, less white-knuckling it and more farceacle dancing about) but that is nitpicky. Librarians terrified me, even after repeated runs, and the fear lasted well past the library, so there is that.

The word I would use to call this game is ""disappointing"". It's linear beyond belief and most of the game is scripted as all balls. Although the game is atmospheric, its certainly not organic. So many of the encounters are scripted, thus making the game insultingly predictable and immersion breaking.

First is scripted moments. There will be many moment in which enemies will be invincible so they can perform scripted actions, ie. jump on you and making you perform a QTE. There is one such moment at the beginning in which an enemy will jump at you and can only be killed through a QTE. You can unload as many shotgun shells as you want, it will not die unless you press E. Funnily enough, pressing E and your character melees the enemy off. Why is it funny? E is the ""use button"", they made you press the ""use"" button instead of your actual ""melee"" button.
Sometimes, the game will just spawn enemies if you find a secret. I cleared an entire building of enemies with loud shotgun fire, absolutely no hostiles left. Found a secret room, only to come out of it and find 3 enemies conveniently standing outside the door.

If like me, you want to have the most immersive experience by playing Survival Ranger difficulty, just don't. It's very clear the game was never designed to be played that way and was just nailed onto it to bait people into playing it, or at least, require you to have knowledge of a game you haven't played yet. Here's a few reasons why.

1. There will be a point in the game where your path will be blocked by spider webs, during which you'll have to burn it with your lighter. Does the game ever tell you you have a lighter? No. Does the game ever indicate it's something you can do? No. You know who will tell you all that? Your old friend Google.

2. Flashlight and Nightvisions are powered by your battery charger. Since you'll be in dark tunnels, you need the light. The battery charger is offhandedly mentioned at the beginning and never brought up again. How to use it? How it works? Never tells you any of that. You know who teaches it to you? Google does.

3. Limited weapons and ammo. What's the problem with that you ask? Firstly, the game likes to lock you in arenas and fight wave after wave of enemies. With how limited the ammo is and how tanky the enemies are, even if you saved up every bullet you can, you'll still find yourself running out before the fighting is even finished. So I found myself running in circles kiting the mobs until some scripted set piece stopped the infinitely re-spawning enemies.

In short, good setting, terrible everything else. This makes me wonder if the game I got was the same as everyone else's.",1649439912,1662070428,False,2,0,0.457386434078216553,0,True,False,False

And that's one of my biggest complains with this game, while the Original Metro 2033 was gritty, dark and an overreaching sense of 'Hopelessness', while the remake completely lacks said atmosphere and qualities.
The gameplay's just Metro Last Light + A few extra weapons and that's about it, so there isn't exactly much to write home about when it comes to it.
And as for the new designs and textures...I would have to say yet again Metro 2033's enemy designs (Especially the Librarians.) And environmental designs were much much more atmospheric and downright creepy and unsettling than the Redux's, which is a shame considering how well it was captured in the original.

It features shooting, exploration, and scavenging, but ultimately it is a linear story where you are introduced to a terrifying yet mysterious post-apocalyptic Moscow, filled with mutants and monsters, but also enigmatic beings like anomalies or ""the shadows"". Also, it has a great variety of difficulty settings, so you can suit the game to you preferred way of enjoying shooters, be it sneaky survivor or Rambo, which is great in my opinion.

Metro is one of the few ""campaign only"" games that I've replayed about 2-3 times each already (both 2033 and Last Light). There's just... something to it, that every now and then I want to go play it all over again. To relive that dark and unnerving Metro experience, without any ""crafting, survival, or day-night cycle"" bullshit, just you, your weapon, few bullets, and whatever lurks in those dark tunnels as you advance forward.

All in all, I enjoyed it. It's an FPS set in the wasteland-post apocalypse setting, with the entire shabang that being radiation, cheap handmade guns as weaponry, and various mutants taking up most of the enemy roster. I think what sets this game apart from others like Fallout or Stalker though is that it's very atmospheric and immersive, much more so than the other two franchises I just mentioned.

Metro is very slow in terms of its combat, you don't get a ton of bullets most of the time and generally there's not a lot of enemies that you're fighting at one given time, save for certain events. There's also things you need to micromanage like your gas mask air supply and flashlight charge. You even have to wipe the blood or grime off your gas mask when it gets dirty, it's pretty cool.

I didn't think the story was that good, but it got the job done. Essentially you're a guy trying to defend his home Metro station from these strange monsters called ""The Dark Ones"" which threaten to destroy it. The game revolves around finding a way to wipe them out and dealing with the harsh world at the same time, and personally although the story itself didn't amaze me I really did like the world this game has. I like the monsters and the characters, and genuinely wanted to see where humanity was gonna go next dealing with the apocalypse. The game is also gorgeous so it's really easy to just get sucked in and explore everything you can.

It's hard for me to think of any bad things with this game, I suppose it would have been cool if the game was slightly less linear, maybe something similar to how Resident Evil does with it's level design and being able to backtrack to certain areas and unlock new things using items you've gained from progressing the main story but I'm just nitpicking.

Based on the novel of the same name Metro 2033 was originally released in 2010 Redux was released in 2014 and offers a remake of Metro 2033 using features from the game's sequel.

[b] Story Summery [/b]

Set in post-apocalyptic Moscow Russia, the surface of Russia is dangerous and highly radioactive the surviving Humans have retreated underground to Russia's vast metro system. 

20 years have passed since the world was plunged in to chaos by nuclear war, remaining humans try to make a living in repurposed metro stations deep underground far from the dangers of the surface. 

As events unfold a new threat emerges.

Your home station of VDNKh is attacked by strange never seen before creatures, You play as Artyom a relatively young and naive metro survivor, VDNKh is once again attacked by mutant creatures that been encountered before, as attacks get more common Artyom decides that going to a central station to get help is a must, his also given a task of alerting a friend's commander shall he not return.

As Artyom ventures to the hostile surface it becomes clear that mutants are not the only threat, as Humans still lurk in their past of warring against each other.

Eventually Artyom reaches his goal, but the threat of those unkown creatures still lurk and a critical decision must be made.


[b] Gameplay Overview [/b]

Metro 2033 redux is a FPS game with horror and stealth elements, mostly a linear game levels encourage minor exploration in finding equipment and collectables.

Combat is to be expected from an FPS game Artyom has a decent array of weapons to use ranging from grenades, throwing knives, to guns in general.

As its a post-apocalyptic game you won't see Guns that you're used to or are easily recognizable instead most weapons are made from spare parts found in the metro our on the surface, (And some can be quite silly looking) During certain levels the player can choose to trade in his/her's current weapon for a better one or upgrade the existing one (Upgrade system is limited don't expect to change every part of your weapons)

Majority of the game takes place underground in or around metro stations, but there are a few Surface levels, Players can approach human enemies either through stealth or traditional FPS gun blazing glory.

Mostly on surface levels and some underground areas the use of a Gas mask is needed to prevent a horrible and painful death from the unbreatheable air.

Through out the game there's a hidden moral point system that can be gain through different ways, good points are usually awarded if one pays attention to events or not thinking with their guns, you lose points if you do things in said events that are deemed bad (E.g shooting a wounded soldier that poses no threat)

depending on the amount of deeds you've done (or not) it'll affect the game's ending.


[b] My Personal Experience [/b]

Personally I've enjoyed my time with the rather gloomy plot and setting, there are some moments in the game that can really make a seasoned or new player jump out of their chair, as for the gameplay it self its enjoyable sneaking around quietly in levels that have humans and picking them off one by one never gets old, the survival features and the use of the gas masks is a nice reminder that Metro 2033 isn't a mindless shooter.

The only main issue I had with this game was that the shooting controls feel a bit clunky as I'm playing with a controller aiming and shooting can feel a bit slow sometimes even with max sensitivity settings, however upon switching to keyboard and mouse it feels better.

Sadly with this style of FPS games it usually has little to no replay value I've played it once a few years ago and haven't touched it until today, it is still a good game to kill some time.

At $20 its an affordable price that will give you a unique experience.

Genrally speaking, Metro 2033 is a good game. Worth the money only on big sale, in my opinion. 
Graphics are okay, nothing too good or too bad, with only few worse moments, where looking at characters would give you a heart-attack. 

Story, comparing to book, was very, very rushed and it shows - there's not much depth into the characters, characters like Bourbon or Khan dissapear before you even have a chance to talk with them properly. It's a huge disadvantage. It's been cut to fit short gameplay (under one day, if you're not going for achievements). The changes in story are also major. [Those are spoilers from the book Metro 2033, so if you haven't read it, please skip this part of review, the fact changes were major is enough for you to know]. [spoiler] VDNKh has completely change, it looks nothing as described in the books. Same goes for Polis, the deal with Librarians and Military doesn't exist, or at least is not mentioned at all. Danila is a completely different person (which is not that bad itself, just not who I expected him to be). Characters acting out of character were also a big wtf moment, especially with our dear Miller. There are more, but those are the ones that I remembered clearly. [/spoiler]

Gameplay - I don't mind it, let's say it like that. I was playing on Survival, and let me tell you one thing: you'll never have enough filters. I would refill them up to 20 minutes (that's the max), and somehow run out of it 5 minutes later. I'm not sure if it's not a bug, 'cause it only happened after two levels. But still, filters are scarce and that's no joke. It got to the point where I had to restar chapter to find extra filters - which got annoying at some point. You can get them only twice in shop, which is not a lot, considering how much time you're spending on surface. Finding it anywhere else is a miracle sometimes, mostly you're getting showered with ammo (always had too much of it). 

Combat itself is not the best one - sometimes option to knock/kill opponents was not showing up, had to either throw knife or shoot at them. Both humans and mutants (especially Librarians) are very sensitive to any form of noise. Type of: you yawn, and they start shooting at you. Plus, even if it was showing me, that enemy can't see me (light off), I'd still get noticed and killed - yet another bug. Librarians somehow would almost always know where I'm heading or bugging in the walls (restarted three times 'cause of that). At some levels you'd have to fight hoards of mutants, which was pain in the ass - case: you blink, you dead. But that's not a complaint, rather a notice for any player. 

Equipment: There's plenty of medkits, so there's no worry about those at all. Night vision has too much contrast, my head started to hurt after I was using it for a longer period of time (but that's on me only, I suppose). Shooting is okay. Compas sucks tho, got lost a lot of times because it was showing me weird directions that were not obvious, and ended up wasting lots of time. Guns and modifications are good, same with bombs. 

The bugs I've encountered: disappearing filters, Librarians getting stuck in the wall, sometimes HUD not showing up. 

I'd especially recommend this game to those, who had never read book, like I did, 'cause I'm slightly disappointed. I had fun, true, but it's missing the sparkle from the book. If I didn't read it before, I think the game would be fun - story is full of action. And fans of Metro Universum, of course! But mind you guy what I wrote here, so you don't get your hopes to high.",1658673844,1658673911,True,8,0,0.58261263370513916,0,True,False,False

The story is pretty abstract and uncertain at first, I didn't realize what the ultimate goal was until I was about to finish the game. The game kinda switches up on you, which I didn't really like.
That's about where the negatives end though.

Despite it being 8 years old, it doesn't feel dated; the graphics are great and the environments are dense and vibrant, while still maintaining a sense of unease. The gunplay is pretty fluid and I loved the customization options for each gun; finding a loadout that worked for me was one of my favourite parts. I played on hardcore and it wasn't too bad overall, I probably could've gotten away with one of the harder modes. At least I have an excuse to replay at some point!

The Metro as a setting is a great choice; I loved how the game used it as not only a locale but also how the team used it to comment on human nature and the inhabitants' choices. The karma system makes sense for this type of game. It prioritizes the stealth aspect of the game, and gives an incentive to explore and discover things about the people and places you meet.

In it, you explore the nature of the Dark Ones, a foreign and mysterious group of questionable intent as you navigate the vast expanse of the metro, an underground Soviet subway system that refugees from the surface retreated to after an apparent World War III.
As the title suggests, the graphics also have a new coat of paint with this rendition, which especially shine on the surface portions of the game. While I've not yet played the original version of the game to compare, I can safely assume that this is one of the major success points of the redux.

To speak on the game’s triumphs more generally, I would say that Metro 2033 succeeds in three main aspects. As previously stated, the graphics (along with the music/ambience) allow the player to really buy into the grimy world of the metro while still keeping the game nice to look at. It also has a suitable selection of weapons, equipment, and pathways to meet your every need in taking on the natural and supernatural foes you encounter. Made even further better by its adherence to the makeshift aesthetic, such as can be seen in the Tihar, a pneumatic hand-pump air gun made from spare parts around the metro. Additionally, the equipment rationing and scavenge mechanics, like the gas mask filters in particular, are fun ways to add resource management in a way that makes sense while adding to the difficulty.

Of course, the story is no slouch either. Its expeditionary-like structure and journal entries work surprisingly well in adding to the tone and immersion, as well as providing ideal accommodations for any playstyle, be it stealth missions, hunker down defenses, or run-and-gun ops. Though most of the time it is up to you how you handle the situation. Conversely, the game’s weakest point, and only real problems are the somewhat frequent glitches and bugs. While I didn’t suffer any outright crashes, I did have to restart the game at a certain point because I was unable to progress. Most of the time though they can be avoided or ignored pretty easily, so there’s that at least. All in all, I would definitely say give it a shot, it’s a fun shooter with a lot to admire.",1625083772,1657928904,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For me, that leap of faith was playing a game described as survival horror - Metro 2033. The 11 hours I spent playing this game is some of the most memorable time I have spent playing games in recent years.

The gameplay mechanics were simple yet nuanced - pumping your airguns, charging your nightvision, easy weapon upgrading.

The world was brilliant, teeming with details and polish, from citizens quarreling drunkenly as you pass a bar to enemies warming their hands by a barrel fire and sharing memories of their families.

The music and sound design was perfectly crafted to make your hair stand on end in the depths of a mushroom-clouded sewer, or inspire thoughts of heroism after your friends survive an onslaught of enemies at the door of a safe zone.

The combat was a little tough at times, considering how much movement the enemies do and how scarce ammo can be, but it really hit that sweet spot of every fight feeling like a struggle without becoming unwinnable.

I have a terrible time playing horror, so for me this game was about as suspenseful and terrifying as I can take. And thankfully I took the chance, because I think everyone should be able to experience Metro 2033 Redux.",1657515188,1657515269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What does affect my rating, is that this graphically and atmospherically great game turned fighting mutants into a chore. They often just rush you mindlessly, while being pretty tanky. There are several scripted sequences where you have to defend against waves of mutants and these are easily the worst parts of the game. The other ones are where you are forced to follow a person who is essentially a tour guide a'la CoD. Oh, and the ones where you are on rails. Literally. Unfortunately, these are prevalent in the first half of the game, but it gets better eventually.
Which are the best ones? Once again, I'm going to parrot many reviewers here: the encounters with humans. Once you get the night vision goggles, you can Splinter Cell those levels by destroying all sources of light and headshotting everyone without much retaliation, if done properly. It's awesome and it feels very empowering. The example is the Front Line mission: a rather big and open level with lots of human targets. Too bad the level is followed by another rail shooter section.

There is other stuff I don't like e.g. some mechanics are just not explained at all like the flashlight charging or lighter burning cobwebs (which is required to progress through one of the earlier missions). Some of the voice acting is absolutely terrible. The library section is too long and the creatures do not always work as advertised. The game has a crappy morality system that affects the ending: you know, you should totally spare those psychotic Nazis and Commies bro, otherwise you're a bad person.

In short: it's at its best when it allows you to approach situations as you see fit, it's at its worst when it's a postapo Call of Duty. It's a good game, but overrated in my opinion.",1656794548,1657210035,True,5,1,0.580890953540802002,0,True,False,False

It's aged pretty badly, to be honest. The graphics might've been revamped to more modern standards, and the difference in comparison with the original is outstanding.

But everything else isn't. The shooting feels very clunky (a lot of times shots are poorly traced and don't hit correctly and sometimes normal enemies are just sponges that resist way too much), annoying bugs (like picked up diaries not being registered from level to level) are common and, worst of all, the AI is awful. You can exploit with relative ease the stupidity of human enemies when it comes to stealth sections, but when it comes to shooting they have pinpoint accuracy from extreme distances and even when you're completlely in the dark. Most of the game is a bit luckluster in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, I love the atmosphere and design. Every piece of scenario in this game feels unique and purposefully placed, every diary you read and every backdrop conversation you hear, it all sums up to build a very rich and horrifying world with a rather dark and complex plot that's told incredibly well thanks to a high degree of nuances and moral dilemmas. Sadly, all of it is somewhat ruined at times by the mechanics.

I still recommend it because it's not a bad game, just very rusty (which is obviously an age thing, since the original was made in 2010 and it was A4's first game). Just, don't try to play at higher difficulties, maybe Normal Ranger at most. It can get very annoying and frustrating at certain parts.",1656839995,1656839995,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are showing their age, even at the highest settings. Visually and stylistically, the game is a dim mess of washed-out grey.

Note: I played on Survival Hardcore.

+ If Metro has a reputation for anything, it's visuals and atmosphere. The game looks great, the environments are full of detail. The surface is desolate and hostile, the sun is harsh, and the wind is strong. The metro is dirty, claustrophobic, and oppressive, and the desperation is palpable. Your gas mask gets smudged, and is damp from condensation. Many of the guns look cobbled together and worn, especially when you start putting on attachments. All the little details are there. Although I haven't read the books, you can tell 4A tried to make the world of the novel come to life and it shows.
+ The music! Especially during tense scenes, it's very fitting.
+ The survival, scavenging nature of the game is excellent. There were moments where I had a dozen bullets to my name, running around dark tunnels, finally running across a body with a few bullets on it that could sustain me for a bit longer. I was on my last filter for my gask mask, running around looking for a crate somewhere, and finally stumbled upon an extra minute of reprieve from suffocation. (I will note there was one time where I suffocated during an in-engine cutscene and I had to redo the preceding fight, that kind of pissed me off, but I can admit that maybe I made a mistake earlier in the level.)
+ The difficulty was done right in my opinion. I have some caveats to this that I'll address later, but I never felt like it was too hard. If I died repeatedly, it was because I had been too trigger happy earlier, or picked the wrong guns, and I was facing the consequences for my actions. Still frustrating, but when that happened, I was annoyed with myself, not the game.

Sounds glowing so far, but that's where the positive ends unfortunately.
On the topic of atmosphere and immersion:
= The metro stations are alive and rich, full of people having conversations that you can listen in on, and so many little details that make them almost real. But...there's kind of nothing to do. Although there are a handful of exceptions, the only meaningful things to do are to buy guns and ammo, find the person you need to talk to, and then leave. So, while the stations looked alive, that didn't quite translate into gameplay.
= Voice acting is hit or miss. Some of the characters are convincing, other times the pacing of their speech (i.e. lack of pauses) is a bit jarring. There's also some weird gaps in between NPC actions, where nobody says anything for like 10-15 seconds. It threw off the pacing for me.
- On the topic of voice acting: Artyom has a voice actor! Artyom has a voice! [i]He talks during every loading screen![/i] Yet, for some reason, in gameplay, he's a Mysterious Silent Protagonist, and never says a word. Characters notice this and mention how silent he is. Characters ask him questions, and he just doesn't respond, or other people respond for him. Sure, same deal in Half-Life, but in Half-Life, Gordon [b]never[/b] talks, so it's just a bit of a weird decision here IMO.
- There's so little character and story depth, and this is [b]the most tragic fault of this game in my opinion.[/b] I beat the game and I have no idea who Artyom actually was, or most anybody for that matter. There's a war, but hardly any detail about it. (Only [spoiler]Khan[/spoiler] has some depth.)

The AI is mediocre.
- Being targeted by nosalises is fine; being targeted by nosalises who are being shot at by my comrades and who run clear past them towards me is immersion-breaking.
- Early in the game I had a demon circle me for a long time and never attack because I was under a four foot wide section of cover. It was intended behavior I guess, but immersion-breaking.
- Similarly, with a late-game enemy, one of your companions explains how they behave: [spoiler]If you look at them, they won't attack. Don't shoot them, and don't turn your back on them, and you'll be fine. Since you're reading the spoiler, it's Librarians.[/spoiler] Except, [spoiler]without provoking it, or even moving an inch, just sitting in the dark, I had one slowly walk up to me, bellow at me, and kill me.[/spoiler] Not a big deal, honestly, but it's not what the game told me to expect.
- The friendly AI is pretty stupid and has terrible aim. I had exited the game at the beginning of a combat section, and upon continuing, a nosalis charged us, but nobody shot at it until it was attempting to murder me. In a later section of the game (I'll be vague to avoid spoilers), traveling with somebody, I watched him shoot a whole stream of bullets at an enemy a couple feet from him and miss all of them.
- Tying in with AI, let's talk about stealth. Metro really wants to be stealth game but it doesn't execute it well. Stealth works simply: if you're in the dark you're hidden, and if you're in light you're visible. But this means that even in bright darkness an enemy won't see you when you're essentially in plain sight (from experience). Other times I walked right past and behind and enemy because his headlamp was facing away from me. The game has pacifist stealth achievements, and I didn't seriously attempt them because I felt like they required cheesing really stupid stealth mechanics.

The game is a bit clunky.
= There's a lot of what you might call forced camera motion, where the game takes control of you for a sequence. Although this isn't strictly a bad thing, it happens CONSTANTLY in this game and it felt a bit excessive to the point of being immersion-breaking.
= Sprinting doesn't feel great.
= [spoiler]There's a level where you carry a child on your back for part of it.[/spoiler] This screws up your aim by adding a bit of lag to your mouse movement. I realize that's the intent, but to me it just added clunk.
- There's a sequence where you use a turret and the controls for it are absolutely infuriating. You have to aim left and right with A and D, and aim up and down with the mouse. This might not sound too bad but in practice I really hated it. I even tried messing with enabling and disabling look inversion, nothing helped. It's just unnecessarily clunky.

A couple thoughts on combat:
= One very viable strategy against a wave of enemies is to backpedal in circles with the revolver. It feels a bit silly.
= The bastard is introduced to you as a shitty gun, but fully modded, it's almost too good against humans. It one-shots unhelmeted soldiers and two-shots basic helmeted ones. Its first bullet is perfectly accurate, too, so it's like a 30-round sniper rifle.

Some quick nitpicks:
- Now, I don't need a game to hold my hand, but any good game should make sure the player is familiar with any unique controls or mechanics in some way. I missed that there is a compass that points you to your target destination, and that's arguably my fault, that's fine. But, the fact that there's a detailed weapon inventory menu was never mentioned in normal gameplay. Only 7 hours in(!) did I notice when looking through the controls menu.
- You walk much faster than other people, yet are expected to walk alongside them. Your speed is slowed down at some points in the game, like in friendly stations, but not at others. The key issue is it's inconsistent, and hence annoying.

It's also just a bit buggy.
- The depth of field effect affects the reticle of your scope, and your laser sight's beam. Not a big deal but it looks weird.
- It crashed twice in my playthrough, one time requiring me to log out of the account / restart my computer because I couldn't see task manager.
- The night vision binoculars are completely broken.
- At one point a demon grabbed me while I was under cover and basically across the room from it.
- Near the end of the game I had a watchman spawn inside me of and instakill me because I ran into the room too early.

Metro 2033 is more a survival thriller than a shooter and you will realise this very quickly once mutants absorb most of your ammo. Avoidance is usually the more prudent choice where possible but you will have to resort to violence on a regular basis. Whether it's mutants or your fellow man in need of a ""negotiation"" don't forget to wipe blood off your mask, change your filter before you run out of air, charge your flashlight with a dynamo so you can see what you're doing, avoid traps lying on the ground and navigate the area via your compass. All of this happens, in game, without the interference of menus. Metro 2033 goes to great lengths to offer a diegetic experience and keep you in the world, which is great, because there is an amazing attention to detail. Before long you will be wrapped up in the Metro's captivating atmosphere. 

Topside, every detail works to tell you the story of those that didn't make it to safety and of what has been lost. Below, In the repurposed metro stations, whether it's eavesdropping on a quarrelsome couple, kids asking their parents about what the sky looks like or men ferrying provisions for transportation, there's always something happening to emphasise that the struggle to survive continues. The end result is that you very much understand the situation of the survivors and can empathise with their actions, even in their more callous moments. Artyom Is a great ""almost silent"" protagonist. What I appreciate most about him is that we are spared from his inner voice. It's all saved for the loading screen in diary format. So while I am aware of his drives, motivations and fears I don't have to listen to him comment on how dark the room is or if the door on the left is the correct door because it has the red handle. The supporting cast are fairly good but honestly, aside from Bourbon, they mostly blend in and facilitate the story rather than command it. Speaking of the story, there is a karma system but it's not entirely obvious what leads to the good ending and what leads to the bad one. Just try you best to be good I guess. I like this, I can understand that others might have gripes with it... but stuff ya! I like it. 

Unfortunately, Metro2033 does have it's problems. The most annoying is probably the sound of AK 47s. I was hoping with redux that they had rerecorded the guns sounds but sadly this is not the case and it can be a bit jarring hearing the same audio file played for each shot.
While there was always the option of stealth, it's not very well defined. Sometimes enemies can look at you from 5m away and not see you and sometimes you get spotted by someone 2 floors above you in a seemingly arbitrary way. I know that Metro goes to great lengths to be diegetic and that's mostly a pro but when it comes to stealth it feels a bit hit or miss. 

Sometimes it wasn't clear what you were supposed to do because you as the player have no idea that the objective is ""Walk to this spot to trigger a scripted event. and it gets even worse when said scripted event is triggered by an NPC partner that walks at the speed of drying paint while you are on your last 30 seconds of air time. 

Gun to my head, and it's definitely an AK, I'd give this a

286690,116816748,76561198058413662,0,123,524,0,524,1654950032,"[code] Metro 2033 Redux is an incredibly atmospheric experience that’s marred by technical problems and gameplay issues[/code]

I’ll have to start this review a warning right off the bat: [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i] only narrowly dodged a “not recommended” status here. In fact, it’s only thanks to me being really fond of single-player FPS campaigns in general that [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i] escaped its non-recommendation. Because, as I’ll point out in the following, there certainly is enough wrong with this game to warrant second thoughts about playing it.

Anyways, let’s get over the basics first. [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i] is based on the Metro books by Dmitri Alexejewitsch Gluchowski. The original [i]Metro 2033[/i] game released in 2010 and received an updated release called [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i] in 2014 – promising a bunch of technical improvements (graphics, AI, combat). That’s the version I’m discussing here of course, as the original [i]Metro 2033[/i] isn’t even sold on Steam anymore (although you might still own it, as it was given away for free shortly before it got delisted).

It's not happening often that we got videogames based on (modern) books but considering the unique setting of the [i]Metro[/i] universe, it’s not surprising: After an atomic war in 2013, the people of Moscow kept on surviving by moving deep underground – to the titular Metro tunnels. Dealing with scarce supplies, mutants, bandits and more, life in the Metro is as miserable as you might imagine. And it is here, set in 2033, where the story of protagonist Artyom starts.

The greatest strength of [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i] is, with no doubt, bringing the setting of the books to life. Be it strolling through the run down but crowded Metro stations, exploring dark and creepy tunnels or hastily moving through the desolated, radioactive surface that used to be Moscow - [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i] nails the atmosphere. The game is dark, it’s claustrophobic, it’s creepy and I’m all here for it.

I also have to mention how the gameplay is accommodating its setting: Before starting the campaign, [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i] allows you to choose between different modes (Survivor, Spartan, Ranger), matching the experience you want to have: a focus on survival or combat (I picked survival)? Though it does seem weird that the Ranger Hardcore mode with disabled UI also disables the quick time event-prompts – ah well. I also liked the idea of military grade bullets serving as both, a currency in the game or as well, bullets. And manually wiping your gas mask from blood during combat is also a nice touch.

In general, the gameplay of [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i] is what you expect from a FPS with a focus on survival: You’ll explore a level, picking up as much ammo, medkits, gas mask filters, etc. as you can – until you get into a fight where you’ll deplete your resources. Rinse and repeat, with some cutscenes, quick time events or turret sections in between. The gunplay’s fine and while I never completely ran out of ammo, I never felt like I could just mindlessly use up my resources. Weapons can be upgraded as well, which is nice, except for me reaching max upgrades with my three weapons pretty soon - which is kind of underwhelming.

To summarize so far: the setting and atmosphere is fantastic, the gameplay what you expect (= fine). Except I’ll now have to talk about the more frustrating aspects of [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i], which quickly turns “gameplay = fine” into something else.

Let’s start of by some minor irritations: Artyom, the protagonist, never speaks in-game. Not only does this make some scenes incredibly awkward, but it’s also even weirder because he actually got a voice in-game: During all loading screens between levels, he reads an excerpt from his diary. So why isn’t he allowed to talk during gameplay? Because the typical answer to “are you okay, Artyom?” is tightly gripping a railcar pole? Come on.

More minor irritations concern enemy behavior or AI. As “improved AI” was a selling point for the [i]Redux[/i] version, I was quite surprised by how bad it behaved sometimes. It got stuck, it kept on repeating the same actions (ducking, standing, ducking, standing, duck-) or it kept ignoring the gunfire of multiple NPCs and instead charged at me, the player, who was not shooting and also far away.

Even more irritating is how enemies react to stealth approaches. Yes, [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i] allows for good old “crouch and slowly move” FPS stealth – including assassinations from behind and throwing knives. What the game can’t decide on, however, is when to detect the player and when not. Sometimes I remained hidden by sneaking in front of enemies even though I was in plain sight. Sometimes I was detected while doing nothing but crouching in an entirely separate & dark room. These inconsistencies made me quickly disregard stealth as a valuable tactic and I just went for straight-up gunfights as long as the enemy presence was manageable.

An unexpected frustrations turned out to be checkpoints. As I played on the “hard” difficulty, I did see my fair share of deaths of course. What I didn’t expected to see is just how far the checkpoints are apart at times. Especially chapter 4 of the game made me go through multiple, spread out enemy sections before granting me a checkpoint. To keep this review spoiler-free, I won’t go into details here - but going through huge chunks of the level over and over because the AI glitched out again in the end is definitely not fun.

And speaking of “definitely not fun”, let’s talk about the technical issues of [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i]. Some of them can’t be helped: NPCs for example, have aged noticeably. While the environments still hold up quite well, the NPC faces do remind you that you’re still playing a videogame after all. But again, the [i]Redux[/i] version released in 2014. I also had issues using Surround sound, which basically muted NPCs dialogue if I wasn’t directly looking at them. I was also unable to get the game to run in full-screen mode at first and had to apply some technical workarounds.

The most frustrating part of [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i], however, was a game-breaking bug I ran into. Near the end of a long chapter, my NPC companion glitched out, which in turn made it impossible to continue as they were supposed to open a gate. Even reloading checkpoints didn’t help – I googled and found out this bug has been plaguing the game for a long time now. Only solution – restarting the entire chapter (!). That’s definitely not something I want to see in a so-called [i]Redux[/i] version of game and apparently, according to Google, it’s not even the only one.

Concluding, [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i] is an extremely atmospheric game with okay gameplay to go along with it. However, multiple issues regarding AI, stealth, checkpoints and technical bugs really drag down the experience. I don’t regret playing [i]Metro 2033 Redux[/i] but there were certainly a few times where I considering just dropping the game entirely. This is wishful thinking, but a Redux [i]Redux[/i] version is what this game really needs for its strengths to shine.",1654955402,1654955402,True,7,0,0.60732799768447876,3,True,False,False

Compelling narrative.
A tense, immersive environment
Good voice acting
Excellent graphics (for the era).
I beat it in just under 9 hours, and that's exactly how much game I wanted.

The meh:
Being the silent protagonist was kind of goofy. I would have preferred to have a voice.
The ammo/money system is unique, but I wanted a bit more to buy and a little more incentive to explore.
I honestly did not like the timed filter system when using the gas mask. It ups the tension, but it doesn't give you time to appreciate the environments.
It's a sausagefest. I would have enjoyed seeing some female Rangers or at least minor NPCs.
It's a great, lore-rich sci-fi world, but it does seem to wear its Stalker and Half-Life influences a bit brazenly.

The bad:
Some of the outdoor levels don't provide you with enough guidance. If you're going to make an on-rails shooter, don't tax my patience too much. Especially with my oxygen constantly running low outside. That one level trying to get around the hotel was annoying AF.

The verdict:
It's a classic, and if you like adventure FPS games like the new Wolfenstein and Tomb Raider games, you owe it to yourself to play. Can't wait to play the sequels.

The game is very linear in what to do next, and the shooting mechanics aren't great, but the game makes up for it with such a great story and awesome pacing. The atmosphere is also great, with spooky sections being scary and emotional sections being sad.
Would like to also say in advance that the stealth mechanics aren't that great and can get frustrating, sometimes just going in guns blazing is sometimes the better option in this game.

Being an old game, even the redux version, it's typical to have old style boring gameplay.
This one is no exception to the fact it is riddled with uninteresting level designs and frustrating gameplay as in boring unfun and irritating gaming experience that you cant wait for it to end sooner.

Negatives:
1. Terrible platforming sections
2. SD cutscene quality
3. Irritating filter play - some section you might need to play the dumb put on/take off filter to deal with the stupid resource management
4. Sections with the unforgiving garbage console checkpoint system
5.  Bullet sponge Enemies
6. Illogical ammo management, some section you pretty much just let your AI teammate's infinite ammo deal the damage while you sprint around avoid taking hit while doing the filter on/off dance..

Positive:
1. Lore for the trilogy, even as boring as it is in this first game.

[h1][b]Storyline: [/b][/h1]
The game is set 20 years after a nuclear holocaust that takes place in Russia. Moscow has devolved into a ruined wasteland populated by bloodthirsty mutants and the toxic air has rendered the terrain uninhabitable. The Metro tunnels are the only remaining option for the survivors. Since new creatures known as the Dark Ones have the capacity to influence people's minds, you, Artyom, are determined to eliminate the threat to humanity. Will you be able to save your fellow survivors or will their already dismal life come to an end? Play the game to find out!

The game's story, in my opinion, is quite interesting and compelling. The game's entire tone is dark, and the story is pretty fitting. The game lasts approximately 8-9 hours.

[h1][b]🎮Gameplay:[/b][/h1]
The Metro series is well known for its premise and the concept of 'searching your surroundings' for ammo and basic survival item. I mean, the game is set in a world where creatures have taken control of the surface, so collecting every bullet you find while traversing the Metro's terrifying tunnels is crucial for your survival. When vital survival equipment is scarce, mankind will naturally battle one another. As a result, you come across both humans and animals who are ready to kill you at first sight. The gameplay is filled with stealth, combat, and horror. There is no such thing as a safe spot; any bloodthirsty mutant could attack you at any time, or you could just perish from the toxic gas owing to a lack of filters.

[b]Combat: [/b]
Humans will always find a way to kill each other, even if weaponry is limited. So, there is diverse gear available for both playstyles, such as throwing knives for a stealth approach and explosives for a guns-blazing approach. Of course, there are numerous weapons to pick from in the game, all of which may be fully customized. I know that going guns-blazing is much more fun than sneaking through the enemies, however, there are two endings in the game, so your actions throughout the game will determine which one you’ll get. So, think twice before you kill someone!

[b]Environment: [/b]
The game is designed to depict a world where creatures rule and everything created by humans is in ruins. But does it actually showcase what it intends to show to the players? The answer is yes! It truly feels like you're battling for your life in a world littered with the bodies of unfortunate individuals and ruined structures, as well as human stations populated by melancholy people who frequently narrate stories about the surface. Just wait until you play the ""Depository"" mission. It's the game's scariest mission, and you'll find out why if you play it.

[b]AI and Difficulty: [/b] 
As a huge fan of the series, I completed the game on three difficulties. In every difficulty, the mutant AI is nearly identical; the only variable is the amount of damage you incur on higher difficulties. The behavior of human enemies, on the other hand, is noticeably different. On higher levels, they'll readily recognize you, making completing the game discreetly a misery. On higher levels, even the most basic HUD features and hints are missing, and the worst part is that you can't see how much ammo you have in your current clip. So, if this is your first time playing the game, stick to the Normal or Hardcore difficulties and avoid the Ranger modes!

[h1][b]📷Graphics:[/b][/h1]
The game looks decent if you can manage to run it on max settings, but if you have a low rig, then the game will look a bit outdated. But trust me, the amount of fun you’ll have while playing the game is surely worth the sacrifice. For those who can run it at max settings, there will undoubtedly be many screenshot-worthy moments as you explore the destroyed Metro tunnels. I did face some visual bugs while playing the game, but they were minor bugs and can be overlooked. The only bothersome bug worth mentioning is that you can get stuck in certain areas and have to restart the game from the latest checkpoint in order to progress. It's a pain, but I've only had it twice.

[h1][b]📝Main Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]
[b]Pros-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Engaging story.
    [*]Easy to learn gameplay mechanics.
    [*]Can run on almost all rigs. 
    [*]The post-apocalyptic environment provides a truly new experience.
    [*]The horror element is implemented perfectly into the game. 
[/list]

[b]Cons-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Some visual bugs are present. 
    [*]No multiplayer modes present.
    [*]The graphics are a bit outdated.
[/list]

[h1][b]🏷️Tips to new players:[/b][/h1] 
Don't rush through the game and take your time exploring the area. If you try to finish it quickly, you will run out of ammo and the game will become unplayable. Also, for human enemies, use assault rifles, and keep a shotgun on hand for mutants, as shotguns are far more effective against them.

[h1][b]😇Honest Rating:[/b][/h1]
If you're seeking for a horror-themed first-person shooter, don't wait any longer and purchase the game. Although twenty dollars for a single-player game is a bit excessive, I would strongly advise purchasing it during a sale.

That said, playing on harder difficulties (plus its no hand-holding approach) makes it far from being a casual experience. There's some very forgiving auto saves, but the persistence of ammo and equipment from one level to the next does give it a legitimate survival feel.

However, the reason I am loving this game is mostly because of the atmosphere and story telling. The game is based on a novel, and it shows. I get a sense of deep lore beneath the surface, like the story is much bigger than the main character. I am tempted to buy the novel even.

Gunplay is VERY satisfying and weapons are quite amazing. Addition of Knockout and Assassination of enemies was an incredible idea and fits very well. Field of View can finally be changed (although only in config files, so you have to research a little). Many loading screens have been removed in favor of a more streamlined experience and longer sub-chapters. Survival mode + Ranger Hardcore is truly a great way to play Metro 2033 Redux, if you want a proper challenge that is!

There is one (at least for me) negative point however. The atmosphere feels way less terrifying than the original Metro 2033. It's more pleasant. It's a lot more brighter, more vibrant. In my opinion, this takes away from ""Metro"" experience. That depends on your point of view in the end.

Overall, an amazing experience and game! 

SPOILER: There is a major bug at the Chapter 7: Tower, which prevented me to advance with Miller in the skeleton walkway in the mission - until I googled that many people had the same issue.

For those who have never heard of this saga, Metro 2033 is first person [i]horror[/i] shooter (more on that later) with some optional stealth sections, one interesting mechanic, and a pretty engaging post-apocalyptic setting. The story is based on a series of Russian novels of the same name, and also the novels that inspired the STALKER series. The game also draws some inspiration from the STALKER series, but besides some similarities more attributable to the plot and setting, Metro 2033 doesn't borrow too much from those games. The Redux version of this game brings better graphics and some changes to the game (which I can't review because I played the original very little).

Let's get the good out of the way. The plot is compelling, particularly when it comes to the endings, but not without its flaws. The music does it's job, but nothing remarkable. The gameplay is good for a horror game, meaning that even if you're good at the shooting aspect, the game won't be easy, and the experience is very tense, owing to the general ambience of the levels and their design, particularly the lightning (or lack thereof), sound design, and mechanics such as the gas mask that requires changing the filter every five miutes.

What's not to like? Well... Much like STALKER, certain things feel a bit janky.
Again, the game works well as a horror game, but not as well as a shooter. I started playing the game in Spartan mode (less emphasis on survival, more emphasis on shooting) and on the Hardcore difficulty, but I switched to Normal difficulty towards the end because I felt that the game was downright unfair. In both Metro and STALKER you can go down extremely quickly due to a poorly-planned gunfight or even environmental hazards. [b] In STALKER however, you had quicksaves. [/b] 

If you play this, do yourself a favour, ignore the advice when adjunting the gamma, and don't lower it too much. That way you'll be able to avoid [b] some [/b] of the instant death traps. The game will occasionally kill you without warning anyway (a wall falls in front of you around the library level). What does that add to a shooter? Play, fight, loot, die, notice and remember the death trap at that specific location, repeat, die to a trap two steps after the first one, repeat. It does add to the horror element, as it is okay for those kinds of games to feel a bit hostile, but here, they're just infuriating.

The combat is meh. You fight against monsters, which often feel like bullet sponges, and you fight humans. There aren't many fights against humans, which is a shame (although it has to do with the plot, so it makes sense), and the gunfighting isn't that special either, though I liked some of the stealth sections, at least the ones that allow you to pick out your enemies silently. Half of weapons available are good: the pistol, the shotguns, and the assault rifles. Pneumatic weaponry sucks IMO. It doesn't feel much more powerful than the regular weapons, but instead much clunkier. There is some weapon costumization, which is nice, and the original mechanic unique to this game is that you literally pay with bullets (of a premium kind, of better quality than your standard ammo).

By the way, I thought the tutorial dialogue sucked, since it usually told me information way before it was useful. If you want to take out your gas mask, long press G. If you need to pump a pneumatic gun, long press R. If you find yourself googling ""Metro 2033 stuck"" and it auto-completes with ""in train"", bring out your ligher with ""M"" and move towards the cobwebs.

The graphics? The game does look realistic, but you can't tell anything apart from anything. The world is just different shades of black (indoors), white (outdoors) and a sea of gray, with ocassional splashes of muddied green, rustied red and boring brown. Looking back at the original, while it looks less immersive, you can see the weapons, ammo pickups and traps quite clearly. Again, if you're into horror shooters, and moving your mouse like crazy to find pickups like it's a point-and-click adventure game, it won't be as bad, but if you're invested with the game mechanics, well, good luck.

What about the plot? Well, I won't spoil anything, but the endings are interesting. The game sends a very clear message, one even I could see, even though I am no Jacob Geller, nor even smart. The execution is very flawed though, absolutely ridden with clichés: the silent hero-protagonist that miraculously survives while everyone else around him dies, the ""I hope I don't get caught"" + ""Oh no I got caught!"" moment, the people who are willing to put their lives on the line for a complete stranger, and specially, the ""oh no, I'm about to be shot!"" played out very slowly while some people take their sweet time rescuing the protagonist. In a few ways you could say that it follows the trend of silent-hero protagonist, of which Half-Life's Gordon Freeman is the prime example. It's not necessarily that the formula is bad, but it's not great, and it won't do you any favours if its not well made. The voice acting in the English version doesn't help either, but switching to Russian makes it all a bit more credble, and it's nice that you can keep the text in English.

One important note on the plot (again, no spoilers): there are two endings. The ""good"" one can be very hard to get on a blind run, depeding on what sort of player you are. If you don't do stealth sections slowly, listening to every line of NPC dialogue to the very end, you don't try to be a pacifist in certain sections, and you don't find every nook and cranny in every room (see the graphics paragraph for why that would be hard), well, you don't get as many ""moral points"". It is not common knowledge if many are awarded on every event, or even how many are needed to be able to trigger (heh) the good ending, but let's just say that the guides on how to earn those (and not lose them) are a bit of a head-ache. Just a heads-up.

Was it fun? No, not really. Was the story interesting? Yes, but I found myself remember that it was a story due to the acting and the clichés of the plot. Was it frustrating? At (many) times, absolutely infuriating. Do I want to jump straight into the sequel right after finishing this one? Eh, maybe later. Would I listen to the soundtrack? Not really, but that's common for horror games. Would I recommend Metro 2033? I guess, maybe, but depending on what type of player you are, know what you're getting into.

The shooting is satisfying enough but not amazing, the movement can be a bit janky, knowing where to go can get confusing at times and the amount of stuff you need to worry about (battery charge, gas mask and filter, pneumatic pressure, lighting cobwebs) is a bit overbearing. There is a charm with these Ukrainian games that shines through in both Metro and Stalker, and I am looking forward to Last Light as I've heard it vastly improves upon the base 2033 establishes.

[b]The greatest strength of Metro 2033 Redux is the oppressive and very intense atmosphere.[/b]
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2807313023[/url]
20 years after the apocalyptic cataclysm that wiped out all life on the surface, the remaining survivors retreated to Moscow's underground.
In the widely distributed network of the metro, a new culture of life emerged from bandits, communists, fascists, mutants and mysterious creatures, which are only called the ""black ones"".
These are shadow creatures that have recently made their way into the metro and have the ability to rob people of their minds.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2807314704[/url]
Protagonist Artjom, who doesn't know what it looks like on the surface, has to say goodbye to his home, or rather his small plot, to warn another metro station about exactly these shadow creatures.
Artjom, who is immune to the attacks of the shadow creatures for initially unclear reasons, is therefore predestined for this mission. Step by step you explore the provisional camps that were built and converted in the metro.

The optical staging, which is accompanied by a very good background noise, ensures an exciting atmosphere that stretches over the entire game. Even if it sounds relatively boring that you struggle through the dark and boring metro most of the time, it's still really exciting and varied in parts and the well-placed shock and horror elements unfold their full effect.

From time to time Artjom ends up on the surface of the destroyed Moscow, which unfortunately cannot really be explored freely. The walking routes are relatively predetermined by ""barricades"" and the mood built up in the dark subway is quickly lost on the surface.

Unfortunately, there are already one or two things to complain about in the game.
Apart from the fights with human opponents and stupid hordes of mutants, which always somehow feel the same, the liveliness that I would have wished for, falls by the wayside, despite the great scenery and the many survivors, and everything seems totally lifeless.

[b]Is the game worth buying? 

Despite the flaws, yes, definitely, because it's still an intense story-driven shooter that's worth experiencing. [/b]

The atmosphere is dark and scary, especially at the Ghosts level. The game's field of view was too close for me, so I had to set it farther to make it less nauseating. Aim assist was also annoying so I had to turn it off because sometimes it would shoot anything besides your target. Both options weren't available in-game so I had to edit the game's config file manually.

The game has a good amount of weapon varieties. My go-to weapons would be anything that didn't have an absurd recoil. The enemy varieties, on the other hand, were mostly the same on most mission. The two most common ones were human enemies and the mutant, Nosalis. There are other mutants in the game, but they were only shown on a few occasions. Playing stealthily would be best until the last few stages of the game (at around the Church level).

The game is relatively simple and mostly the same because of how linear it is. I was able to finish my second playthrough relatively faster than my first one because I already knew what I was doing. I was skipping most loot and collectibles so that I could get my two final achievements which had something to do with the ending and what game mode you were playing (Survival or Spartan).

Overall, this game was an amazing experience. Even though the non-playable characters' faces are lifeless, the story is captivating enough to get your attention.

Metro 2033 is one of the best shooters I have ever played, one that isn't afraid to challenge the player in battle or leave them lost and wandering. With great shooting mechanics and different survival tools such as your charger and gas mask, you are taken through the dark, depressing and hellish landscape of post-apocalyptic Russia as Artyom. A young man from before the war who does not break when pitted against the abominations of the new world, doing what he can to fight for his people in a grey, exploded to rubble Moscow when they call on him for help. 
The gameplay makes for an enthralling FPS, leaving you without a dull moment with nothing to do and always punishing you for leaving a stone unturned or losing concentration. However, what I would compliment it most on is the fact that it takes its story more seriously than a series like Fallout, 2033 doesn't shy away from the supernatural or alien elements that made F1 an amazing story. Reality itself is unstable in these forsaken lands, and you get a sense that you can never know what is true and what is a trick of the mind. 
With the subway system sealed off from the unbreathable atmosphere inhabited by mutants, only those ready for a fight for the death may venture outside. Resources are scarce, tensions are high between the neighboring stations and to top it all, a new and mysterious supernatural race has started to weak havoc on the people of Metro.

Since the original Metro 2033 was taken off Steam I did not have any chance to complete the archievments for obvious reasons (DLC). Thats also why I bought this game in sale (got it on 100% now). Furthermore there was no reason named for those actions by Deep Silver.

Imo the redux version is not worth a play compared to the original one. I dont even know why they made this redux version. The graphics are slightley better but its not really worth mentioning. I experienced more game breaking bugs than in the original one (e.g getting dropped by a demon in a car and beeing stuck there / baited by retrieving ammo into a path where you cant get out of - stuck as well (happend in the dead city) and so on).
The game sometimes just crashes for no reason. If you tap out of the game/your screen and back in again sometimes the screen is zoomed in and its not fixable but with a restart.
Also some stuff was changed or did not happen in the original (e.g. the weapons on the bed of the blacksmith were missing / the library entrance was different / the spiders / D6 was just not scary at all and overall there have been a lot of missed opportunities to really improve this game in a remastered version.

I will remove this review if you put the original metro back up again (including dlcs). Just make it free so everyone can enjoy the start of the metro games journey.

This game has a lot of good things and a lot of bad things.
Good - Visuals, level design, weapons are pretty okay.
Bad - Story. There is still advanced civilization after nuking? Really? Maintenance alone would cripple those tunnels in a month, then weapons and train parts too. 
Monsters are like HP sponges, even with close range shotgun it takes 3 shots on average at close range to kill them.
Some tasks are extremely unexplained in very russian way. Like where you have to bomb tunnels under unending spawning monsters and you have to run around map searching what to do next. First time I ran out of bullets defending corner for 20 minutes.
Flying monsters seem invulnerable and boring. Those strange tunnel lights were also strange and the dude who spouts pseudoreligion... urgh.
Yea, stealth is pretty awful too. Knives you get are overpowered as hell and melee ""kill"" has many limitations.
Also when combat start enemy generally knows where you are and is very precise with shooting, so direct combat is mostly awful too.

But it is a really good experience, it develops a lot of atmosphere and set aside facial animations, which are pretty outdated and probably were when the game released in 2010, it still looks nice.
Both soundtrack and voice acting in English get the job done. Voice acting especially is really well done. I disliked the sound effects on some guns, though. They lack a certain ""punch"".
Speaking of things I dislike: having played Exodus before this, it's lack of ""space"" is jarring. The levels are big, don't get me wrong, but it's sooo damn linear.
The story is okay, I guess. Nothing to write home about - but it's easily forgotten when you are in combat: the game feels dark, gritty and really sells the post-apocaypse.

Metro 2033 and other entries in the series have great gameplay and an very immersive worlds, I've put hundreds of hours into the series and see myself coming back for more playthroughs every year. If its your first playthrough, I wouldn't recommend Ranger Hardcore for it, unless you're confident in your ablilties.

Though there are some bugs in the first two games, random crashes at times; It's not unplayable however, but they happen not often as for in a single playthrough you're unlikely to run into these issues. 
On Ranger Hardcore, there is a UI bug that doesn't show your throwables when you switch them with tab, with only an audio cue that will tell you which you have selected; However this is manageable if you've familiarized yourself with them on previous sittings. On Exodus this has been majorly fixed and it doesn't have this problem.
In Last Light, there is a bug where in after/during the level Bandits you loose all ability to do take downs, which heavily makes trying to get the good ending of the game difficult in later levels. 

If you're a fan of 2033 and Last light and haven't given Exodus a try because of the drift to Open World; I highly recommend you give it a try, as it doesn't feel out of place. Exodus has become one of my favorite games in the series.
With the added crafting mechanic, expanded weapon systems, and various other elements. It has a great story and the DLC's for it are great, my favorite out of the two being Sam's Story.
I have yet to give Ironmode(NG+) mode a try yet, as I don't have my old saves, but I'll update my opinion on that when I get a chance.

Overall, if you're a returning fan, a fan of games like Dishonored, Half Life, Stalker, and other FPS's, or hesitant; I highly recommend this game series to you, it's truly one of my favorite series out there.

Just 5 minutes ago i gave up on my FOURTH (!) and definitely final attempt at actually finishing this game. Every single attempt over the past years I started the game from scratch on a fresh install. Yet every single time I get about halfway through the story, some random crash deletes ALL my collectibles, ALL the control settings, and basically disables my keyboard and mouse, so once I continue playing I can't even hit ESC to get to the menu.

I tried it on two completely different PCs with different specs and on different Windows installations (7, 8, 10). Same result, the game becomes unplayable.

I can deal with random crashes, it happens in a lot of games.
I can deal with starting over ONCE. 

However, I can not deal with the game erasing all my progress and basically locking me out of the gameplay, repeatedly. Calling this ""rebuilt and remastered for next-gen"" is nothing but a joke.

The animations of the monsters in this game are hilarious and totally not scary in anyway, shape, or form. I got the series on sale for a couple bucks so I am not really upset but I hope the later games deliver. The first one is not scary, super on rails and you have a companion of some form with you for hours. Half-Life 2 is scarier and more challenging and better than this game. I'd also recommend the STALKER series over this. Similar ""vibe"" but much better in execution as far as their first entries in the series go. Kinda disappointing but maybe Last Light and Exodus are better. The lighting, combat and animations are a real let down for a survival horror game. It is all way to easy.",1649987453,1649987453,False,0,1,0,1,True,False,False

But seriously, it's not an entirely inaccurate descriptive. The game's not bad, but it could have been much better. You gotta add some extra ingredients to make the weapons decent, but even with garnish they're still not all that interesting. Plus the MC himself is about as agile as a potato. The setting seems like a great start but never gets all that interesting no matter how deep you dig into it. And there were little birsts of flavor here and there with the story, but that too ends up highly under-cooked and under-seasoned. In the end, you just find more potato. 

In terms of playtime, it was definitely less than the 10 hrs. I clocked. I had it up while afk for awhile - probably 1-2 hrs. And again, it's definitely not bad, it's just not as good as it could have been on any front, either. My biggest issue is that it seems like there's a deeper, more interesting story but you never really learn anything about it. My guess would be the other games in the series get more interesting. If so, just skip this one - you won't miss any important developments.",1649981580,1649982162,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False
