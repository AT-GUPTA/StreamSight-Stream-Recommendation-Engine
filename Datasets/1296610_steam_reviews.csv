I realize it's not full release yet, but boy do they need to work on balance. The first part, (pre-cruciball 10-ish) are fun and challenging, especially if you're picking the game up for the first time. However, after that short period, no amount of skill will allow you to win certain fights. Actually, you've only got a 50/50 chance of getting to the second stage since one, (of two) of the first level bosses is, effectively, unbeatable unless you've lucked into just the most perfect build. Random, unavoidable, occurrences often pop up and nuke your build. Some items are so incredibly rare they may as well not exist, while other garbage items pop up CONSTANTLY. 

I know you're probably thinking, ""What do you think a roguelite is, man?"". Uh huh. I thought so too. The big difference between this game and say, Binding of Isaac, or even something as simple as Vampire Survivors, is that the game WILL try to screw you over, but the decisions you make and the skill at playing the game can give you that extra little edge to win. They encourage you to ""git gud"" because your skill and forethought win games. This game tries for that, (and, like I said, the earlier levels largely deliver) but it just gives way, WAY too much power to RNG. Imagine working your butt off for an hour, doing everything right on one of those other games and just as you're about to win a giant hand comes on screen, flips a coin and says ""Whoops! You lose! Soreeeeeeeey!"". Not fun, eh? Yeah, it effectively happens on this game ALL THE TIME. It's addictive. Elements are fun. Long term? Not so much.

This game is cute and fun but far to random.
About 3 hours in I figured out the strat/a build I liked and then it was just a matter of the stars aligning for me to get something similar to what I wanted to win the game.

Because the combat doesn't have much of a skill element, random bad luck can often lead to an unwinnable state. 
In many other rogue likes, if you get bad luck you can actually out skill it and still win. Not here.

There's this boss that's a literal actual brick wall with a turn limit. Its just a massive damage check and if your build doesn't just happen to be stupid high damage consistently then you insta lose.

[h2]I cannot recommend addictive gameplay.[/h2]
[b]I know it's not addiction, but it's behavior compulsion, which is the same but for behavior, and not substance abuse.[/b]
I sure hope people don't recommend crack or cocaine out there. I sure ain't doing that. And I'm not doing it either with this game. This is more a word of warning than anything, really. Like, [b]BE CAREFUL, I HATE THIS GAME AND I'M STILL PLAYING IT![/b] kinda thing.

[h2]A Rogue-lite where Skill barely matters.[/h2]
Normally, Rogue-lites, and even Rogue-likes, have learning curves. The more you play, the better you get at it, the more bearable it is to NOT get good items and such.
In this game, it's all luck... mostly. If you can't synergize your items and orbs, your run is dead. There's only knowledge of what may or may not work with one or another, and technically that's a skill. Throwing the orb can also be consider a skill but, it does little effect in the general outcome. In the end, everything has to go right up to the boss fights.
The normal battles, and even the elite ones, are not dangerous most of the time. Only if you get really unlucky. The boss fights? Well, there's a reason why the worst boss is a [b]LITERAL WALL.[/b] They are basically Stats Check. If you can't get past them, you're not ready for the next area. But, as I already said, normal battles are not a problem most of the time.
If you lose to a boss, it's just unfortunate that synergy did not work, or was not developed enough... or you just got unlucky things did not go your way. It can be frustrating when you were actually enjoying the run.

[h2][b]HERE'S AN AMAZING ITEM![/b] but[/h2]
The game has to be balanced. For some reason. So here's a side-effect that is gonna backfire so bad, you'll think twice next time.
Most items available are either mediocre, or a double edge blade. I'm fine with having both, but only having both is... not very good. What about straight up good items? Like the Meteorite Shard? The Gift that Keeps on Giving? Which both can still backfire but not as much as any other items. Often it is required to focus on something to carry the run on, but it's mostly a matter of trial-and-error if it's gonna work. It really feels like the whole game is a double edge sword, where you might or not enjoy the run you have.
Maybe, less double edging and more actual bosses that doesn't die to a single good throw could be better. It's often better to reward than to punish.
Music still good. I don't know why they made the last boss battle theme so... uh, epic? But, sure. Some battle layouts were fixed, some still lacking and some still causes me physical pain. They are these gimmick ones, like the ones that looks like trees, or something else. The Minotaur one is actually fine now. It was terrible before.

[h2]What about the Shops?[/h2]
Useless! Or close to that. I never have money for anything when I go into it, and I have to pay to remove an orb. Now that's some great business practice. You ask FOR MONEY to remove and orb that you WILL SELL LATER to someone else, because I cannot throw it at your face. [b]STONKS.[/b]
And yes, I know it has to be balance, so abusing removing orbs just so you can use the cheese and shield combo for the win might be too broken and that's why you have to pay money, but why the price increase? It barely makes sense. Or maybe I'm only getting shops in the first area, when I have no money because I'm constantly upgrading the orbs to be able to keep up with the bullshit coming up.

I love the different characters you can unlock, each with their own unique trait, and how unlocking each of these also unlocks their specialised orbs and relics.
The variety of different relics and orbs in the game, and the different ways to obtain them means that no two runs are ever the same.

Already spent so much time in this game (just to get to Cruciball level 8 from 7 took well over 50 runs!), but still got a long way to go if I want to 100% this one!

Very fun and smart concept. The execution is a bit lacking, but having looked over the reviews from a year or two ago, it's clear this game has gone pretty far in the correct direction since then, so I'll give it a weak thumbs up in hopes that this game gets even stronger with time.

Despite what a lot of other players seem to think, I don't really have an issue with this game's balancing. I think you can make a lot of different builds work, and it's a lot of fun to play around with different set-ups! This is especially true on low cruciball runs, where the game feels much more fair and rewarding to play. The issue, especially in high cruciball runs, is that you need to really rely on RNG. Most builds seem to be viable, yes, but you have to really commit to those builds and get most/all relics and orbs that lean into that play style, which is a massive ask. The game just doesn't give you enough options, especially not for relics. There doesn't really feel like there's enough time to pivot either - once you pick a build, it feels like you must stick with it, and if it doesn't pan out, then GG, start again. Peglin can be really frustrating and anticlimactic to this end.

However, when things align well (or you're playing lower difficulties and having a more relaxed run), this game is super satisfying. Designing some maps to looks like the enemies you're facing is really creative. Others move about in really fun ways. The dragon fight was a personal favorite. There's just a lot of cool stuff going on. Wish there was more variety - 7 total bosses across 3 stages is pretty minimal, and each encounter's map has no variations. But I still think the gimmick is quite fun for quite awhile regardless.

It can be incredibly fun or insanely frustrating depending on RNG. You could get a devastating combination of balls and relics and still get wiped depending on how the pegs are oriented or you could have a godly combination of balls but get them in the worst possible order of use. But that's just how RNG goes, so yeah. The castle REALLY needs some balancing though since if you don't have any balls that hit any or all enemies in the lineup you'll get rinsed by archers and mages that can attack you each turn from any distance, and they're very frequent no matter the RNG so you'll run out of money to heal very quickly if you're don't have a relic or ball to help with gathering money. In fact the more money you're able to collect the easier the time you'll have...just like IRL! How immersive!

After another 85 hours since, I can say that the game has improved by a good margin. At least a few of the pegboards have been changed, but there's still some that are groan inducing when you see them, including the dragon boss fight's board being absolutely the worst. It can render your entire build through the whole game useless because of it's poor design.

- Has primate brain and loves to see balls bounce and numbers go up
- Loves the roguelike genre and wants a fun game to kill ~<40 min
- Needs fun classes, specialized builds and different ways to reach the end
- Enjoys being challenged the further you go on

And can deal with:

- Some losses feeling unfair, getting screwed over a few times just to crawl towards death in a dead run
- It still being developed (very sparingly)
- A limited OST (make no mistake these songs go hard. But there's like five of them)

Then you'll be smashing slimes with pebbles, daggers, swords, boulders, lasers, obelisks and whatever else you can stuff in a ball in no time.

I played the demo of this game for like 10 hours because I was broke and then finally got the game. It's been my favorite frustration over the last month or so. It's got a totally addictive vibe (who could of guessed, with this being close to peggle and PLINKO for crying out loud) and it's just plain fun. As much as I've mumbled ""oh, sure, that seemed fair"" I've also been elated by a new record to my damage output.

Wrote this review because of some negative ones I saw, and if this game was meant to be more and got rushed, I wouldn't know. I'm only judging the product I got, and it's worth the price. And hey, like I mentioned, there are still a few updates every couple of months or so it looks like - but again right now, I still think the game is that good and you won't go wrong picking it up.

Some of the good stuff first: As far as a Peggle-type game goes, this is probably the best you're getting on PC. There's a simplistic, but charming art style to it. The music is pretty good. Definitely has some catchy tunes, which is a good thing since you'll be hearing a select few CONSTANTLY for large chunks of each playthrough.

The classes have tremendous variety, each allowing for a very different way to try and build your run. Certain orbs and items are limited to one or two classes, and some can just use them better than another class can due to their starting perks. You can also make custom runs out of any combination of orbs/items you've ever taken with any class.

The difficulty curve, though, is where things get a little...off. The base game's difficulty is reasonable, and if you're decent at this type of game, you'll get the hang of and beat it pretty quick. When you start going up in Cruciball levels (This game's version of Slay the Spire's Ascensions), It's not so much a difficulty curve anymore as a difficulty CLIFF. There's 15 levels in the current version as of when I wrote this, intending for 20 in the full release. 5 is what I'd call the best balance of difficulty since the negatives it puts on you there actually make some new builds possible. 8 is a good challenge. Above 10, each level has a NASTY debuff, and winning on 14-15 requires an absurd amount of skill to get to where you even have a CHANCE of winning (if RNG lets you).

Overall though, I'd still say a good game and worth buying if you're into this.",1705042009,1705042009,True,1,0,0.506015539169311523,0,True,False,True

In the game your goal is to defeat enemies by racking up damage by hitting pegs.  You build a deck of orbs, which are your attacks.  Each has a different damage per peg hit, and often have a special effect.  They work sort of like a deck of cards, but you can see what's coming up for a long while.  Just like deckbuilders, an important part of the game is deciding what orbs to add to your deck, considering synergies, and limiting your deck to get to your powerful orbs faster.  There are also relics, which are usually small powerups you get to keep.  Though the boss relics are special, as they are often double edge swords.  Sure one might increase the damage of all shots, but it could also remove a refresh peg, limit your aim, or prevent you from picking up more gold.

Extra Positives:
*There's a freeplay mode where you can just go crazy with random combos.
*A lot of surprise interactions with ? nodes.  They thought of what happens if you lose all your orbs.
*Save scumming is possible.  If just one bad move goes horribly wrong, you can save scum with 0 consequences.
*Not very luck based with your shots.  You can aim in all directions, and it usually feels like where the ball goes is because of your aim instead of luck.
*You heal after beating the boss for an area, leading to an interesting game of surviving with just enough health to beat the boss for the full heal afterwards.
*You can build powerful decks involving avoiding hitting critical hit pegs, which is pretty interesting.

Negatives:
*There are moments when your board is almost clear, but the refresh peg is blocked by a few other pegs.  This can result in shots only doing 1 or 2 damage until you can finally reach the refresh peg.  These situations aren't fun.
*Situations where your deck isn't very powerful, but just strong enough not to get you killed.  It's unsatisfying for you to only get 20 damage done to an enemy with 700 health, multiple times in a row.
*Runs where none of the good orbs seem to show up, or they show up so late that there isn't enough time to build the rest of your deck around it.
*One of the mini-bosses in the 3rd area is just pretty annoying.  The board is build in a way it's hard to get more than 7 hits in with a shot.

   After buying it I had fun for a bit. Until I realized the game wasn't about skill at all but about luck, just as others are saying.  The relics and orbs are random and you need so much power to get through the levels but you may not get it and enemies become impossible mainly bosses.  So its not set up well.  The idea is great but there needs to be patches to make this game more enjoyable as In not making orbs so random.

   There needs to be a mode where you can continue your progress because as soon as you die you have to start all over again.
   Some relics as in random buffs dont make any sense to be on the board as they just give you negative affects but you dont even have to take them you can just walk away.   So why have them if we dont have to take them?  

I find myself having fun for a short while but always frustrated at the end.  When there is nothing i can do to prevent eminent death.

Issues I have come across:

Coins at the end of a round, would be nice if we could always hit them and get a few extra coins before navigating to the next location. This however does not always work and you get no coins for your last orb thrown.

Medieval scorpion device on level 2 (BOSS) it is way too hard, I could see it being a later boss but most often you do not have the abilities to get through it and it hits hard. I had 200 hp from a buff and some great dmg dealers yet still failed. only get past this level if a different boss shows up.

Take un-needed relics off completely that give the character loss effects.  As we wont use them anyway.  Or give every ball a positive /negative outcome

Make relics per map/level  not all the way through the game at random. This would make it easier for devs to make strategic decisions players will overcome and eventually learn.

when choosing a new orb, let us see the other orbs easily by tapping tab or something

make an easy and hard mode

Biggest problem is relic and orb bloat. Poor balancing of several of the pegboards, enemy load-outs, and events means you have to hope RNG gives you the right orbs and relics at the right time. Most Orb and relic perks aren't really strong enough to be worthwhile otherwise. You can't collect them in the wrong order either, because some are completely useless at keeping you alive long enough to find the next one. The Cruciball challenge levels make the issues even more severe.  I also don't think we should ever have to consider skipping a relic after defeating the Boss at the end of a zone. There's only two boss fights that give a reward afterwards, so is guaranteeing a useful relic reward really too much to ask for? 

Several relics are great to have in the Forest, but do nothing for you in the caves. The original versions of the gardening gloves and salt shaker had this issue, but you could still find them anywhere. Both relics have been changed, but I'd argue the gloves are actually worse now. The new salt shaker sounds nice, but it is actually useless until you have enough healing orbs or relics. 

An easy way to address the orb/relic bloat and scaling issue is to overhaul the economy. Better orbs/relics should cost more, weaker ones should be cheaper, instead of everything being the same price. The same should be the case for Orb upgrades. We should also be able to sell orbs instead of having to pay to get rid of orbs. Being able to sell Relics we don't want would be even better. Gift that keeps on giving is a great example of a very powerful relic: the dragon hoard was the Only pegboard in the game that counters the Gift, (but that pegboard was horrible no matter what your deck looked like, so I was very thankful when they flattened it out a bit!). Otherwise, the Gift can turn a losing run into a winning run. I would love to spend up to 200 G if I found it in a shop! If the shops stocked a larger fraction of the available orbs/relics, that would also significantly improve the bloat issue.

All orbs also need more upgrade potential. The price of upgrades could also vary depending on level and strength of the orb being upgraded. On a lucky run, it is possible to fully upgrade all of the starting pebbles during the Forest Level; But if you don't pick up any relics that boost the pebbles, you won't stand much of a chance at surviving in the castle when there are OP shields standing between you and a line of archers and mages that hit harder than the Slime Boss!

Slime Boss pegboard has needed overhauled for a very long time. The slime Mini-boss and Minotaur mini-boss used to have horrible pegboards, but both were significantly improved and now I enjoy them even during Cruciball!!

I also dont like a lot of the stages here. I especially don't appreciate the fact it's so hard to know where my 2nd bounce will go towards. In a game like this at the very least you should try to minimize the RNG on ball bounces by trying to predict where your ball will land after the first shot. I guess unless you spend hundreds of hours to understand the physics on this game it's simply impossible to tell. I could do that within the first hour playing Roundguard or Peggle.

However my biggest issue though is the fact some stages have extremely questionable design choices - besides being a game full of RNG already by adding a 3rd layer of RNG (besides relics and the balls bouncing around) you also have full blind stages. That stage ruined at least two of my runs and I simply could not comprehend why because I was blinded by game mechanics lol...

RNG opted to begin work on two new games. Which, for a big studio, wouldn't even be a blip. Problem is, RNG is two guys and one gal. And the gal had a new idea or two. So now Peglin's on its way to the DayZ/Star Citizen graveyard of empty promises. Don't buy this game. They have no real intent on finishing it.

The closest thing to ""complete"" Peglin will ever be is when they give up on all their promises, release one big bugfix/balance patch, and call that 1.0. It won't ever be anywhere near what the devs swore up and down it was going to be by end of last year.

It's a fun experience blending Peggle and Rougelikes which gives a lot to discover and, assuming you enjoy the genre, is great at holding your attention for the early runs - it's incredibly satisfying to discover synergies and watch as your buffs and damage numbers go crazy. However, it's a little poor in terms of replayability in one sitting - I often find myself playing one or two runs and having my fill, whereas with other rougelikes like Slay the Spire, I could do runs for hours on end. I'd recommend this game for People who enjoy strategy games. To me, the game is a 9/10 for the first few hours, then drops off to about a 7.5/10 when you've finished discovering.

The games music and art direction is endearing, and the mechanics of things like crits and bombs are very fun to play with. A particular favourite of mine is when you can get certain relics to induce a chain reaction of bombs - super satisfying to see it go off. The bosses are interesting and generally not too easy or difficult, with the notable exception of the Slime Boss in act 1 being a complete run ender at higher ascensions, and the Wall boss in act 2 being trivially easy if you've built reasonably well. I've seen some people in these reviews complain about the bosses health pools, but my experience is that with proper scaling to do enough damage this is more than manageable - none of the later bosses health pools feel unreasonable to me even at the highest Cruciballs (this game's version of ascensions). The characters all feel distinct and interesting, and how you unlock them is interesting in itself - although certain characters are noticably weaker or stronger than others and playing the weaker ones, such as Roundrel, at higher ascensions feels a little unappealing at times.

Unfortunately, the game has flaws which mostly start once the novelty of discovery wears off. Once you start reaching higher Cruciballs, runs come down more and more to luck as you start getting worn down quickly even by hallway enemies, particularly in the 2nd act. If you're not offered the right things early, including getting a tempo relic very early on, then you're kinda screwed - as in the second act you outright NEED a lot of aoe to not eat half your healthbar to certain hallway enemies - and there's RNG to get through even with a highroll, as getting unlucky with where refreshes end up can easily whittle you down fast as your pegboard depletes without a good way to refresh it. There's also a lot of frustration with the navigation, which is, like everything else in the game, decided by Pachinko gameplay. This means that bad bounces can completely screw up your planning for the act, and feel particularly unfair. While the bosses are generally good, I do feel they are slightly unbalanced in that one of the bosses is noticably harder than the other in both act 1 and 2 (and to a lesser extent even act 3). There's also a little bit of a lack of visual flare after beating enemies, but this has never really bothered me at least, and a lack of an overarching story - but that's not what I come to this type of game for.",1704216650,1704216650,True,4,0,0.574860274791717529,0,True,False,True

32 hour's in i still encounter new stuff almost every-round. there is still so much stuff to do and it its still challenging to clear all the bosses that mix up every new game. trying to make certain builds and figuring out what route to take is also allot of fun. at one point i had a build that threw bombs at the enemy for about 2 minutes killing me and the boss in the process.

a multiplayer mode would be great. as simple as taking turns or a bit more complex as pvp where at a couple of points in the game you can battle each other. but that is not what this game is about its just pure mind numbing fun.",1703944097,1703944097,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

Art style is pretty nice, and the music isn’t too intense and gives you something to vibe to as you watch a ball bounce around a box.

I’d like to see more levels added in the future, or even an endurance mode is case you get a great run going and don’t want it to end abruptly after the 3rd boss.

past cruciball ten+ it's not a roguelike anymore. 
A roguelike in the most watered down terms is a game where you have a singular run where you can't die because it resets you to the start and you have to do it all over again. thats the charm of a roguelike. 
You come out defeated but ready to get more and on the surfice peglin is just that.

But it goes wrong when you have an option that you can restart a room and the loot you get from it, and it basically becomes essential at cruciball 10+ because at that point if you get a really bad thing the run is over and you don't want to throw 30 minutes away and loose your proccess when you got so far, or not far even!

It just honestly sucks that it becomes necessary if you dont want to spent a ridicoulus amount of times throwing runs away because you got a bad option or you simply didn't get the right once at the right time.

I love this game and it might just be a skill issue, but it just looses what I love about roguelikes so much when I feel like the game wants me to do that to progress. and it kind off also destroyed the fun I had with peglin, and the fact they're going to be 5 more is so daunting to me and really makes me not to play anymore.

This game is a repetitive nightmare, the only thing that changes are the final bosses in each levels. The maps are the same, the encounters are the same and each run has felt the same, I have run several times back to back and it just felt like one endless run. unlocking characters are near impossible right now with the current balancing, out of 100 runs the max spinfection i have been able to stack on a boss is 20, and the max bulwark i have been able to stack has been 30 (skill issue? maybe!) but the game shouldn't make it this hard to unlock new things even in early access.
THAT BEING SAID, this game can be something and i am holding out hope that it gets better, it plays a little better on mobile than it does here, but it is much easier to see what you are doing and where you are aiming.
The soundtrack is fun to listen to when playing through the levels and lessen the repetitive feeling as you nod your head and blow up enemies. and the peglins! I MEAN JUST LOOK AT EM! they're so cute i wanna hug em, each enemy has this same art style and cuteness to it.

Every Patch nerfs good stuff but doesnt elevate the unusable to a useful level. Every Patch some useless Orbs and Artifacts get added that clutter the Loot table to an extend, where you know right after the Forest if you lost the game. Bosses are weirdly balanced, with the QR Code being a God amongst men, whilst the crystal thing barely does anything. It is a coinflip if you get absolutely mauled during your travel or if you breeze through the entire thing without issues. Some Elites and non Elite Fights are balanced so badly, that they are absolute run enders like the Person doing the Handstand in the last Area. 

It is a very short game which prizes itself on replayability, yet the Maps never change, there is never anything interesting and after 20 Hours of playing this on the Steam Deck I feel like I know absolutely every Event and Fight by heart. There is about 5 to 6 Hours of original Content, after that its just ""which fight havent I seen, Which Boss havent I fought and which Orbs havent I used"". 

I started off loving the game but I dont feel like its going in a good directions. Content Updates just litter the game with garbage and it is so random if you even got a shot at winning, even if you consider other pachinko games. Peglin is fun when you do well, but skill plays such little importance that you might as well blindfire.

So this is basically Slay the Spire meet Peggle. Instead of a deck of cards, you have special balls that behave in unique ways. Neat conceptually, unfortunately there's really almost no variance. A few of the orbs and relics can really influence the way you play, but most of them really don't. You're supposed to be able to unlock other characters with unique abilities, but the unlock requirements seem virtually impossible to achieve through anything but sheer dumb luck.

Speaking of luck? There are so many luck factors to this game that you basically can't plan for anything. Just pray that RNGesus is kind to you... in your map layout, the orbs you're offered, the relics you're offered, the enemies you face, the bosses you get, the order your orbs are dealt, the way your orbs bounce...

It gets just straight up frustrating at times, especially when you have a really good run, right up until the last boss and you're even doing good on that boss which you've never beaten before... then the game just decides that... you're done.

On top of that, I don't feel there's enough content to warrant the price tag. At full price the game feels incomplete. I say wait for at least 50% off.

*edit to add:
I finally managed to complete the objectives to unlock the other 3 playable characters, two of whom don't really seem any different than the base one except you're more restricted. The third, I can't tell you because the game decided not to register me winning a battle with over 100 Ballwark, which took me forever to achieve because of how many times the game was just like ""LOL, no Ballwark generation for you.""

At this point, I've uninstalled the game, and have no intention of ever going back to it. I'd rather just roll a d6 and declare that I win if I roll 3 6s in a row. Less frustrating use of my time.",1701155403,1701932154,False,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,True

The main problems are gameplay related, but for starters, the presentation just isn't there. This is a peg/pachinko game. It needs to have a good celebration when you win. It doesn't have to be fireworks and choruses when you finish a level, like peggle, but you need some kind of worthwhile celebration. That's just a staple of the gametype. 

Things get really repetitive after a while. You may say ""this is a peg/pachinko game, of course it gets repetitive"", but I'm speaking more to level progression. The worlds are always in the same order, and always have the same levels in the same locations, and there is always the same progression through the worlds. There are a few different paths to choose from on each map, but it gets tedious following the same progression and the same routes and seeing the same levels over and over. This is a peg game; it shouldn't be super complicated to program procedural levels and layouts and map progression. It wold be nice to see things changed up and not have to be stuck on the same few tracks again and again.

Poor balancing plagues the moment-to-moment gameplay. You'll cruise through levels as you crush enemies and mini-bosses, but world bosses starting with the castle have huge health boosts and make you feel pathetic. There's nothing fun about mowing through common enemies, and then watching a 10k HP boss receive 48 damage per shot for multiple shots in a row. It's like watching a train wreck, because you know there's no way you will beat the boss with the tools you have. Maybe I'm missing a key gameplay element in boss fights, but they have stupid high difficulty spikes that feel like cheap shots. I don't remember bosses being this bad when I first picked up the game, but it just feels stupid now.

Too man garbage orbs and relics clutter the game. The devs have continued adding new orbs, but too many are crap. Some of them will absolutely destroy enemies while others waste your time. It's the same with relics. Some are such garbage that you'll end up rejecting the relics offered to you instead of taking one, while others are basically a win button. Players should enjoy building their bag of orbs and experimenting, not spending their time wading through garbage in hopes of finding something useful.

There's also been a fair amount of nerfing of useful items. If your solution to poor balancing is nerfing the useful items then your design is poor. You are taking the useful items and making them garbage, which ends up making everything garbage. You should be lifting up your crap and making it better, instead of taking your good things and making them crap. As an example, lightning orbs especially have been turned into garbage. It could be argued they were OP originally, but they are absolutely useless now.

As this game is still in early access, the devs have been continually adding content to the game. But so far their additions have not positively improved the gameplay experience. Currently it seems they are shoving content into the game without taking the time to iterate on making it fun, meaningful, or interesting, while also negatively impacting what was good in their game.

Also, this line on the store page description, ""Explore a new map every time, with different orbs, enemies, and surprises along the way."", is false. It is NOT a new map every time. It is not a new map anytime EVER. Unless there is a feature that I am unaware of, the game always progresses in the same order, and while you have the option to choose different paths on each map, they always end up in the same place.

I doubt I will play this much more. I may check in again if it ever leaves early access, but as it is now, the game gets tedious after a while and often makes you feel like you've either been cheated or like you received a win button. Neither experience is fulfilling.

One last note: you cannot change the keybindings. Why? That's a basic thing to do. Weird oversight.",1701753205,1701753551,False,94,2,0.739254772663116455,0,True,False,True

The price of this game ( normally $20) of over $5 is way too high for the gameplay of this game and eventually why I did a refund after playing for a short period.

It's kinda boring in which it doesn't feel like a good pachinko game. The idea of the game is really cool- but the actual gameplay is very one-note. The ball types you get don't really change the overall feel of the game with their effects/impacts on the round. I don't feel any growth or progression outside of a variety of ball-types and leveling these balls effects.

I feel like the ""pachinko"" aspect isn't really the highlight as it tries to adapt a pinball-like physics when interacting with the pegs/stages. The RNG of physics doesn't feel heavy. Everything is a bit too bouncy imo and there's no real weight behind the ball you shoot- maybe for the best player-wise to get more pegs but it doesn't feel like pachinko outside of the way the game is framed.

I'm sure this hits for a certain audience as this game is generally well reviewed- but I really didn't care for this as a pachinko game nor as a roguelike. Maybe it's the graphic style or overall physics- but nothing hit despite being on my wishlist for a long time thinking that this game looked interesting.",1701650726,1701650726,False,2,0,0.437956184148788452,0,True,False,True

If you want to play on higher levels (Cruciballs) or you're a completionist who wants to max out the game, around Cruciball 8 it will start to be harder. After Cruciball 12 the fun will end, as game take more and more of your tools to deal with enemies. On two final Cruciball levels the suffering will start, there will be no place for fun or experimental builds, you will feel every missed shot, every awkwardly placed refresh will make you rage and you will have a list of boards which you hate. You will abandon runs, you will alt+F4 the game, you will throw hands when you die in most dominant run, just because you run into unfavorable encounter.

In general game if fun to pick up and start playing, concept is pretty nice. Unfortunately, the base of it is the reason why this game can be so frustrating on higher levels. You throw balls onto the peg board, you cannot fully control how or where it will go. You cannot control the layout of the board or where specials pegs appear. Problems with this are very apparent on higher levels where enemies have more hp, your deck is worse, your board is worse, and a single mistake can cost you even 40hp in some encounters. Two runs in a row you can see same first enemy, one time you will beat it without losing any health, and other time you will lose 20 - just because RNG hated you.

I played the demo a fair bit here and here and was looking forward to early access. 
Originally I had 65mins for my review well that's as long as it took for me to beat Peglin 3 maps ~12 choices each map and 3 bosses and I was hoping for more content because I was enjoying it.


But as of my current review my negative review still stands 
-They added what feels like 20+ orbs which is great if you want to just try something new but still a few orbs you find just prefer because they work with all builds and don't need to build everything around them
-Still kinda feels like live and die by the relics you get. No way to remove to or sell relics mistakenly take a relic that you thought my help your build but ruin it might as well restart.
-They added a shop mechanic now where you collect coins from coin pegs on the board which you can spend to buy the orbs, orb upgrade or use at the shop. Biggest improvement nice addition
-And custom mode so you can customise your start with the things you unlock.

Biggest issue I find is that at the point I feel like my ""deck"" is strong I have a good combo happening it beats everything and I don't need to adjust it for new maps or enemies just stacking what ever relics I can find and the game is over. 

This is a short Roguelite game that needs something that increase runtime so you can play longer


Alright Been almost a Year, Played just a little bit more, since they added more... Run time is still about the same. :( 

New Characters are nice what you like to see

Cruiball Is alright but really does force your build earlier on 

GAME IS MOSTLY RNG NOW.
They added so many more things like relics and more orbs that it's like that was the issue but now THERE IS A LOT OF BLOAT and it's hard to sort through it to get different builds to even play with outside of custom mode since there is only like 3-5 orbs out of 72 that fit any strong themed build 

Found more reliable to quit to menu and redo the nodes until something even close comes up to what I want

For the last patch or two the boss relic pool has been saturated by total garbage where I either am compelled to skip my pick or I take a bait relic and die as a result. A few 'powerful drawback but niche strength' relics are cool, but [url=https://peglin.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Boss_Relics] look at this pool. [/url] It's nearly every single one. Stuff like 'take a crit off the board' or 'take a refresh off the board' might not be too harsh drawbacks for some decks, or even benefits for others, but too often for the last several months (Imo the addition of Leaf the Rest for Later, which is ONLY SEMI-DECENT IN REFRESH ABUSE DECKS, THE ARCHETYPE IT IS EXPLICITLY DESIGNED FOR, YES I HAVE TRIED IT was the breaking point) it has felt like I go through the whole first two acts only to get fucked by one of my boss relics in act 3. 

Bosses don't feel good to beat anymore and haven't for a while. I shouldn't be compelled to skip the majority of my boss relics, but considering they range in quality from 'accidentally trigger a crit with a multiball in your muscircle deck and nerf your damage by >30%"" to ""kill yourself,"" it seems I have no choice.

I highly recommend this game as an investment more than anything, you may not buy it and sit down with it spending 20+ hours slinging pebballs for your entire weekend but I can guarantee it's one you come back to a lot because it really does something in this space that I don't know any other games are doing, or are doing as well as this.

What trinkets are offered, what balls, and as the difficulty level increases the game brazenly cheats, causing your orbs to bounce in ways completely contradictory to any known laws of physics. Indeed, playing on a higher difficulty and then going to a newer character on a lower difficulty setting makes this blindingly apparent, as you can rather easily predict the path the ball will take from a given bounce as it approaches the peg.
On the higher difficulties this becomes impossible, as the ball will sometimes lose all momentum upon striking the peg, despite it not being a slime peg, or bounce in the same direction as it was going when it hit, when it should very obviously have rebounded.
The first few difficulties are quite entertaining, but as the cheating becomes more and more apparent the higher you climb, the game loses all appeal as your input means less and less.",1700716543,1700716543,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The problem is physics updates.

I don't know why, but around the time they added classes the devs changed the way ball physics worked, and what had been a solid, predictable Peggle experience changed into something more akin to a pachinko machine, with much of the skill involved in ball placement and trajectory targetting being lost.

This, IMO, harms the roguelike nature of the game, since it renders the skill side of the equation more or less moot, often as early as the initial launch of your ball. This is disappointing, because a LOT of what this game does -- from the ball abilities to the visuals to the music -- is great, but without that element of control in your play, it stops being a roguelike puzzle game and, instead, turns into an experience where all you can *really* do is pick abilities and hope they work out.

I think it's fun and offers a fun unique spin on the rogue-like genre. Granted I haven't played many rogue-likes (which may be where some of my frustration stems from) but I've seen gameplay of enough to know that this is fairly unique. I also really love the simplistic art design and un-intrusive sound effects. I've experienced some frustrating parts of the game which are even more frustrating because they really dont have to be.

The game is fun and can be addicting. Some of the boards are oddly frustrating (oddly for the reason that... they shouldn't be). I'm reviewing this in early access so I understand that the overall quality has room for improvement and that the game length can be considered pretty short. I think a full run through at normal speed can be completed in around 25-30 mins depending on your build. Currently I'm okay with it because I usually play while watching a movie/youtube so I don't care. I like the possibility of potential variety of combining orbs and artifacts to customize your builds but some of the artifacts are a bit perplexing in that their negative effects do not outweigh their positives, especially considering there are artifacts only with positives which you will most likely hunt down and pick no matter what every run.

I understand that in early access there is still a lot of work that should be done to make this experience truly great and fun and I purchased after playing the free demo to support the devs in hopefully, someday, releasing the full product.

I like the challenging enemies and bosses, but it's annoying that your success essentially hinges on very specific items and sometimes nearly killing yourself to burrow through to a damn refresh peg. Currently I don't see a ton of build variety.

My suggestions for the devs off the top of my head:

- Please rework some of the boards or the physics as they can become incredibly frustrating, like beating your head against a wall smashing 1 peg per turn to get to a refresh peg that too often end up in some of the goofiest and trickiest places. It especially sucks when I've got 1 or 2 good orbs and 5 lvl-1 pebballs (the game's version of a basic bitch orb).

- Add more maps and board variety for certain encounters. 

- Rework some of the negative artifact effects.

My suggestions for the customer:

- PLAY THE DEMO to see if you like the game

- Buy the game if you feel like this game adds enough of a unique spin on roguelikes and support the devs to see this game to its full potential.

I've sit and contemplated on whether or not I actually recommend this game to people and have given it a few updates to see if anything really changed with my opinion and I think at this point I have to just give up and go with a no on the recommendation, at least overall. There's some caveats I'll get into, however. I will also be using Slay the Spire as a reference point since this game takes a lot of it's structure and underlying mechanics from that game.

Been playing this ever since there was just one class to play as, and now after all the updates and everything I feel like I have a lot to say about where I stand on the game:

For the first few maybe 10-20 hours of runs, experimenting with the different classes and climbing up to around Cruciball 5-6, you'll generally have a good time, it can be a bit more RNG heavy than your usual rogue-like/lite, but for those first few hours it's not too egregious. I cannot say it stays that way, unfortunately.

At around the Cruciball 7-ish area the game goes from ""Fun experimenting with different builds and making the most of what you've got with each class"" to ""If you don't have a very hyper-specific build going for your class, your chance of winning is 0%"" and it's like the flip of a switch. Then you hit Cruciball 10+ and it becomes ""If you don't get an even more hyper-specific build going IMMEDIATELY, you're not even going to make it through Act 1, or even halfway through it""

There's no real difficulty curve, it just does a vertical spike every 4-5 difficulty levels. Compared to something like Slay The Spire, where it does the same sort of thing with it's difficulty, but each character has much more viable build varieties and is overall just much better balanced in that game.

[h1] Issues With The Game [/h1]

To get into more specifics about the problems with this game, I'll break them down here:

[h3] Orb Rewards [/h3]

In STS each class has their own set of starting cards, with a few generic cards shared by everyone and 2 unique cards to them that [b] will not appear in any rewards [/b] outside of one specific random event that can happen. This is important because in Peglin, each character has the exact same number of starting orbs, and 1 orb that is different for each class (except Peglin and Roundrel have the exact same loadout), every one of these orbs can still be found again as a reward for beating a fight.

This creates a problem of just adding more bloat to the item pool that is already too bloated. No one is realistically ever going to take these items as a reward either, so they're literally just there to make getting a viable build harder. Add this on top of the fact that 2 Cruciball levels add even more useless junk to your starting loadout, and it's just not fun to see yet another stone or daggorb in your rewards when you desperately need something to get a run going.

[h3] Build Variety [/h3]

This is most likely the biggest issue with the game, or tied with another issue I have. As stated before, from Cruciball 0-5/6 you can get away with actually experimenting with new things and have a lot of builds work and this is where the game is at it's best. Anything past that though, you need very specific builds to even have a chance of winning.

This wouldn't be as big of a problem if not for one thing: reward bloat. Way too often will you get entirely useless rewards, or orbs/relics for builds that just straight up have no chance of actually winning, and as cruciball gets higher, less and less become viable and everything in general becomes harder to actually obtain. 

As it is at the time of this review, each class has 1, MAYBE 2 viable builds to go for in Cruciball 7+, except for default Peglin because he has access to nearly everything, which creates the bigger issue of the item pool being so bloated you'll almost never get any kind of actual build going.

[h3] Level Variety/Quality [/h3]

This is the other biggest issue with the game, there's just not enough variety in board layouts and the game becomes far too same-y much too fast. On top of that, a lot of board layouts are just really badly designed. You can very often find boards that can have your refresh option be near impossible to reach, meaning you'll be wasting shots just to dig it out of some corner. 

The game has one and ONLY one relic that can cause the refresh pegs to move, and you can add more of them through other relics, but this is still an issue that can occur unless you have, again, a very specific build to curb this issue.

[h3] Navigation [/h3]

Another issue I have with the game is the way navigation is done. After you beat a level, you have to shoot a ball into the area that goes the direction you want to go. Sometimes there are fire-pits that do damage to you for misnavigating. As an idea, I like it, however, a lot of board setups and other various issues very, VERY often cause you to go a direction you don't want to go.

This kind of navigation works for something like STS as you can plan out a route, weigh risks vs rewards and decide on last minute branches on what you want to do depending on how well a particular floor went. In Peglin, you can very desperately need to go one direction and either the board is set up in a way that makes that impossible/entirely random, or you could shoot your ball and it just so happened to shoot a bit harder than usual this time and bounce off a peg so hard it bounces in the other direction with no real control, and every time you misnavigate it almost never feels good or like you could have prevented it.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Overall with all of these issues, I can't in good faith recommend the game. It is fun for those first few hours, but once you start digging into the harder difficulties and challenges the game offers (which is the only real extra content waiting for you after beating it the first few times), things become just entirely unfun and frustrating and just gets exponentially worse in that regard the further you go.

I do hope the devs fix a lot of these issues the best they can because the game does have a lot of potential and can be fun under the right circumstances. I wouldn't have put 93 hours into this game if there wasn't something there hooking me, after all. But to anyone looking to get into it, be warned, either wait and play something like Slay The Spire instead, or if you do choose to get this game, just be prepared for the frustration that will eventually happen.

If things change in the future i'll update my review and recommendation, but as of now this is where I stand with the game for anyone looking to get into it.",1698916305,1698916305,False,52,3,0.765229880809783936,0,True,False,True

It's frustrating to play for an hour just to get beat in one match with one enemy no matter how powerful your load out is. I will change my mind if they address this issue.
The game also seems to use my cpu usage for a game that doesn't have the greatest graphics. My water pump fan runs like i'm playing some crazy 3D graphics! I hope the devs fix this and more with this game. 72 hours in and I'm not going to be able to stream this anymore.

UPDATE: 300+ Hours in and I'm really trying here. I do now recommend this game but it's not for the faint of heart. The mini-boss is somewhat manageable. The CPU/GPU usage has still not been addressed. The devs keep saying there will be classes introduced but have done nothing.

 On a positive note, I've been able to survive at some of the hardest levels of the game.

Another thing, the music of this game does not get enough credit! Whoever composed this score was blessed with some kind of crazy natural talent... you can tell them I said so!

Early game is do or die, if you don't have a proper build before the 1st boss just restart your run. Hell, if your 1st relic isn't good, then just keep restarting until you get a good one.

Item bloat is an issue, too many orbs and relics not tailored to a specific build is what cripples crucible runs. You'll either have too much or too little. God forbid you run into the 'duplicate mirror' event.

At time of writing I have over 50 hours, and just finished the last difficulty level (15) as the starting character, getting the last (as of now) achievement. I was still using a new build, unlocked a new relic.

Peglin's an amazing game to boot up for an hour for a run, or a few minutes for just a board or two, or get lost for the whole afternoon. highly recommend!",1696739969,1696739969,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I ended up taking a break after beating my first run since certain items/orbs were either completely useless or insanely broken. Coming back after a few months, the game feels easier in the best ways possible. Encounters feel challenging, yet possible, encounters like the ballista encounter is far easier with amount of piercing orbs or orbs that get around hitting the enemy in front, and frankly, I love the new gameplay options.

As an example of a glowup, the Gambler's Chip used to be significantly worse, since two of the zones were 0x. So if you were running orbs with multiball and a single one hit a 0x, your entire damage shot didn't actually matter anymore. Now, since the 0x was changed to 0,5x, you still get punished for taking it and not getting the shot lined up so it hits the 2x, but now multiball actually works in a way that doesn't completely invalidate your Gambler's Chip. 

Builds feel easier to craft, the orbs feel powerful and honestly, I really like where the game is at in terms of balance. Highly recommend, and honestly at this point, I can't wait to see any new orbs that come out",1696396060,1696396060,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Many runs will fail based purely on unpredictable and uncontrollable factors. Again, at lower difficulties this problem is not a problem, but this is not because the difficulty modifiers introduce it, simply because the lack thereof grants a sizeable buffer to random punishment that makes it manageable. Most of the game's problems are built right into its core. It would benefit greatly from a minor reduction to the difficulty of the modifiers and a serious overhaul of many of its random attributes to be more reliable.

I will amend, however, that the game is still in beta so my concerns may be addressed, and, for some, they may just be an aspect of the rogue like experience. My specific complaints may come from a dissonance of how much control I wish to have in a style of game that hinges inherently on random factors.

There just isnt a lot to do or many fun ways to combine different balls and powers. It is usually ideal to have few balls so you can get to your powerfull ones faster.

The cruciball challange doesn't add fun new ways to play but rather nerfs your character and adds clutter to your inventory, thus it wasn't really that fun to me.

Coming back to this game after several updates I find it a lot more annoying and tedious to play. Sadly it is the kind of roguelite that gets more difficult as you unlock more things. The amount of stages you go through doesn't change but there are more stuffs in the item pool so the game become a lot more RNG heavy as it keeps getting more difficult to find synergy in your builds. It's really frustrating when every run ends up having a half-build that doesn't work because the game refuses to give you anything that works well together and every wins felt like you got the better roll instead of having a better build.

Initial review:
Surprisingly fun and addictive roguelite. The balancing could use some more work and due to the nature of the game I feel like the balance will never be perfect and you can't really get rid of RNG ruining runs because of it. 

As of the time of this review the game currently has 3 maps with 2 bosses each (6 bosses in total). The bosses all have their own gimmick but none of them really play upon on peggle gameplay and more of a test to your build. There is also the usual ascension system from other roguelike in the form of Cruciball in this game, but they felt more tedious than challenging.

Compared to other roguelikes like Enter The Gungeon, Binding of Isaac and even Nuclear Throne, the game is just so short and I found myself going ""That's it?"" when I beat the last stage's boss.
There's only 3 stages which is a shame because the game is really fun and addicting but it just desperately needs more stages.

[strike]As of the time of this writing, the price for content just isn't there.  It's a great concept and a fun game, and I have no doubt that one day it will be worth $20 if the developers add content, but in Early Access, this should have been a $10 until they did that.  I understand the game is not complete, and purchases are being used to pay for development to a certain extent, but this is Early Access ー not Kickstarter.

For the first few weeks after I purchased the game, it had become pretty unbalanced and, to an extent, what I would call ""artificially difficult"".  The developers addressed this, but that artificial difficulty had been helping to mask the lack of content by gating the last 5% of the game behind difficult RNG, without making it obvious that it was only the last 5% of the game.  Right after the re-balance patch, I realized the spot I kept getting stuck on was the game's final boss fight.

You will no doubt have fun if you purchase this game, and I certainly have, but I also suspect you'll be wishing you had at least some of your money back as well.[/strike]",1664593365,1694251578,True,0,0,0.649334251880645752,0,True,False,True

The game is 3 stages, no endless mode to enjoy your crazy builds. 
Some builds are nearly impossible to get going, for a mediocre result (Healing -> dmg build), and other builds are basically a free win blindfolded.
The enemies are super limited, and even with different sprites, their attacks are limited to 4-6 mechanics.
Some relics are build defining, some relics are top tier for every build, some relics are generally strong, and some are...... OK.
The orbs are very varied, and all of them have some fun mechanics.

Sometimes you may not get the items you want or you might misinterpret how some effects / relics will interact with each other- quickly ending your run.
Sometimes you will face a random encounter that perfectly blocks your build and causes you to suffer a crippling defeat at the last second.

Despite that it’s still an amazing experience almost every time you play, especially if you focus on going with the flow and try to make new, funny, or outright strange builds as opposed to just trying to win using an “optimal” strategy.
Don’t like that? Try the cruciball [sic] instead. It may not be the hardest thing out there, but it can certainly give you a few hours of a challenging deck building experience where you’re forced to improvise and use your knowledge of game mechanics to scrape by with what you have.

Although it may not seem like it on paper- I believe that this pixelated pachinko-playing goblin simulator is an amazing standalone game that is well worth its price (plus there’s a free demo you can try).

The game in its core is a roguelike, and you'll lose and start over a million times, but if you manage to beat the game (3 worlds with around 10-13 ""levels"" each), you can start your new round with a twist, that keeps adding. So after you beat the game the first time, maybe enemies will be a bit stronger. And if you manage to beat it that way, then you also start with less gold. And if you beat it like that, then next time you'll also have less special pegs on each level. And such, and such. This means you always have a new challenge to beat. After 80 hours, I'm at Cruciball level 9 and there seems to be at least 15. And you can also change the character at some point, which brings new game modes into the table.

Cruciball 15 is now difficult, but doable if you spend a good few runs (if you dont cheat that is, otherwise its like 4-8 or so games) 

-------------REVIEW BELOW IS FROM TWO BIG UPDATES AGO, THE PROBLEMS ARE GONE. --------------------------

I'll be blunt, this game is (can be) pretty fun, but ultimately badly designed. There's way too much rng; the worst kind of rng.

I'm talking about the higher cruciball levels (the game's difficulty modifiers; 15 lvls). which the game is not at all designed around. Why? It's because a single bad thing can ruin an entire run. This includes even a single bad shot (though this is an extreme example, it happens, and enough times that its a problem). 
Much more common is a terribly placed refresh/bomb/crit, which happens too often.

Even if everything is and is going perfectly a single rng based bit of unluckiness can screw everything up, this remains the case the entire run. 
And since you need a good setup to have a shot at winning, you're probably going to have to rely on the random events. That adds even more rng. As normal fights are often not really worth the cost/risk.
I should also mention this is with constantly going in and out of the run so i can constantly be, resetting fights, rerolling artifacts, pegs, orbs and other things obsessively, which probably isn't intended.

While the rng, which governs every espect, the map, enemies, loot, peg placement, cycle of orbs you'll be firing, etc., is a problem, what makes it unbearable is all the 'checks'. 
In other words, 'you don't have the counter/solution to a problem you're extremely likely or just garenteed to face, you're dead.' These include: can you deal with shields and/or multiple enemies (multi target and pierce), red bombs (requires great healing or a lot of hp), multiple sources of dps checks (the Wall bossfight, the castle mage elite, in the castle killing enemies fast enough to get to the archers and mages before they deplete your health, 4 boxes final bosses).
The games expects you to have everything while giving nothing.

And there's a few more rare checks, like the third floors invisible enemies or how you can deal with your orbs being funneled into a single hole (looking at you dragon).

Since it's a turn based roguelike theres's no getting around bad rng with skill like, taking a populair roguelike(lite) as an example, hades or something.

The central problem revolves around not having enough resources (gold, dmg and hp) and having to constantly deplete them. This leads to constant early deaths (and deaths in general) even with good setups and thus a LOT of frustration, because of something completely out of your control. That's why i call it badly designed.
A bonus/free chooseable or in the beginning of a run, much like the free relic you get would go a long way to make it more doable. That or along with a reroll button (that can even reroll random events and what you're fighting, 'cept the bosses).",1683496262,1693412019,True,0,0,0.524098575115203857,0,True,False,True

The first few times you play through will be fun in their own right but the true fun comes after you understand what each of the balls and artifacts do. Once you have this understanding you will be able to come up with some absolutely insane combinations of powers that allow you to just obliterate your enemies. New players alike will be able to pull this off (even if by accident) as evidenced by GF giving the game a try at my request and doing better than me! I strongly recommend giving this game a shot if you want something fun and relaxing; you'll have a BALL (couldn't resist).",1692654970,1692654970,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First thing I noticed that drove me nuts is my cursor doesn't actually line up with my shot trajectory.  Got used to that, kept playing for a couple hours. Only my first run was not frustrating at every turn. Most of the relics are garbage that requires you to take a debuff to get a buff that may or may not be useful, bad enough when you're picking one (assuming you can even get one that doesn't just straight debuff you given the rest of your build), but really bad when it is just straight given to you from a ? tile.  (FYI - the coin that makes the bottom slots do 0.5x / 1x / 2x damage, and makes one of the 0.5x slots do damage to you, is just straight terrible)  The explanations of the orbs are bad. Some of them aren't too hard to figure out, but others just have an icon for what it does, and some tell you it applies some condition but doesn't tell you what that condition does. The game doesn't even tell you how your damage works to start with, you just have to click stuff and figure it out. (not that it's complicated - just cumulative based on how many pegs hit / whether you have crit active - but it's hard to be confident whether I understand the implications of various orbs' special abilities since it doesn't really explain anything)  

Shops seem like a complete waste of time since I generally get enough gold per level to buy one orb and upgrade one orb, or upgrade and heal. If I'm lucky and don't just miss all the coins while trying to just hit that dang bomb to deal with the swarm of enemies....  I never have any gold to save. 

This could be a really fun game with a little more polish and less bad RNG consequences, but as it is now it isn't, it's just frustrating. One of the discussions mentioned the game felt like it was built around a microtransaction framework without microtransactions.

So if you like Peggle, Goblins, A complete monopoly on all forms of purchases in their Peglin society, or goofy little guys you'll like this game.
TLDR: The game is good and unique.
The gameplay's good, it's pretty much a Peggle rogue-like with deck building.
It has an entirely controllable level of difficulty so no matter if you chose ""I'm too young to die"" on DOOM (The wrong choice) or master mode on Terraria (The wrong choice) or even if you're a normal person, it'll have something for you.
It has 3 unlockable characters not counting Isa-Peglin, the Balladin, Roundrell and Spinventor.
The base Peglin is a Jack of all trades, you can get most orbs and relics making for the most diversity.
The Balladin is centred around Ballwark aka shield, a Magdalene or tank of the Peglin world.
The Roundrell is like the rogue class, based around debuffs and generally being a nuisance to whatever he's fighting.
The Spinventor is a way to almost force diversity, the orbs you have get stronger if they are one of a kind, but can be not-but useless if you have many of them.
In conclusion: If you have $20, like balls and rouge-likes. Tf you waiting for? Peglin is peak rogue-like design, it can be enjoyed by literally anybody on the face of the Earth.

it's a shame because the highs of this game are incredible: pegs being hit in satisfying trickshots, monstrous destruction of enemies on god runs, even after just 6 hours there's always a desire to try another run, and early runs that aren't working can be quickly aborted. it feels like a casino every time i start up a run. the difference is that casinos don't stomp you down and draw it out over an uncomfortably long time.

peglin is a peggle roguelike, and it only succeeds at half of its' genre. it is an unabashed failure of everything that makes roguelikes great (which, with some tuning, i think it can overcome), but reinvents the peggle formula in a way that enticed me enough to buy it after seeing enough god runs on YT, but not to make me happy with my purchase.

EDIT:

forgive me. i was skill issuing hard. the new Spinventor update seems to generally make death spirals less common with a general power increase across the board. unlocking the characters is still kinda miserable but it sorta just happens as you make a very strong build. the only one i had to force was shields and that was done with Fiery Furnace + the orb that makes the shield. poison worked for me by making a bomb build with the bomb poison relic, and the slime one just happened naturally with a few slime upgrades.

game sucks if you're trying to do a dedicated orb build. just pick the powerful stuff in general and go nuts. the classes have a different enough playstyle that's satisfying enough for me. i still think this game is kind of a mess of RNG but at least now it's an enjoyable mess. don't take this game too seriously, just let things happen and it'll probably be fun/lag the hell out of your computer.",1688406923,1691667336,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,True

Mostly in the form of new balls and a couple new characters, that add a little bit of diversity. Could still use more. It doesn't quite scratch that gameplay loop itch that makes me want to keep hitting ""Play Again"" at the end of a rogue like. YMMV  but giving it a tentative thumbs up, in spite of the price being a bit too high still, and the content being somewhat lacking.

In time this could be a really fun game, but in its current early access state there is not enough content to justify the cost, even at sale price. I bought the game in a bundle on sale, and 11 hours in I feel like I've seen everything the game has to offer. 

I've won three or four runs now. I feel pretty sure I've seen all of the bosses and combat encounters, and there isn't much variety in them. There is a NG+ mode similar to STS ascensions, as most roguelikes have these days. It's fine, but nothing you haven't seen before. I also feel like I end up in the same builds every run. Attempts at experimenting with synergies or weak balls and items in hopes of hitting ""dream"" synergies just haven't felt worthwhile. 

Hopefully this will all be more fleshed out later in development, but for now this has the content of a free demo for a $10 game that is being sold for nearly double that.

DEATHS DO NOT FEEL EARNED.

You can get a nearly perfect combination of orbs and relics, yet a few unlucky throws during a battle can make that synergy evaporate in an instant. It doesn't help that the balance of the game is way off, some builds simply suck and others are unbelievably overpowered. The rewards for finding synergies are dubious. You can spend an entire game searching for a combo and never get it, or if you do, it just sucks, and even if it doesn't suck, the aforementioned unearned death could occur. This game design discourages trying new things.

A few pegboards are simply awful, which funnel your thrown orbs into death traps where they do little damage. This is made worse when your refreshes are trapped in difficult-to-reach places where the best you can do is chip away at each individual peg in the way to get to it, all the while doing tiny amounts of damage to enemies who relentlessly chip away at your health. I'm looking at you, Slime boss, Dragon boss, slime+bat fight, etc.

A few specific relics and orbs have hard counters which are impossible to predict. This issue is somewhat limited, but the worst example of this is the Gift That Keeps Giving, a BOSS RELIC, which makes it virtually impossible to defeat the dragon boss on the final stage (whose appearance is up to chance).

ALL of these issues are exacerbated when you play on Cruciball, where the game takes away the little saving grace it has. Some of the time, gaining a Cruciball level will simply increase the overall game difficulty, such as increasing enemy health and damage, which is a good way to amp up the challenge. The rest of the time, however, it severely cripples you by taking away vital game mechanics, such as refreshes, crits, gold, etc. You either get lucky and find an orb or relic to compensate, which has an opportunity cost, or you die miserably. I like that the game has progression and a goal to reach, but Cruciball makes the experience far too unforgiving and unfair. And without progression, the game gets quite stale. The best description for Cruciball is a series of compounding roadblocks that you must spend money (and luck) to remove before you can focus in on building your deck. It's a giant middle finger to people who want to have fun with the game still being replayable.

If you like heavily luck-based games, then Peglin is for you. However, if you've seen the popular YouTube videos of extremely fun or overpowered builds/synergies and want to replicate them on your own, prepare to have your patience tested. Of course, you can always relegate yourself to the custom run sandbox mode, but, in my opinion, where's the accomplishment in that?",1687045069,1691273092,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

i was honestly kinda skeptical on whether i was gonna enjoy this game or not considering the fact that i have a hard time coming back to roguelikes, but seeing all the balls bounce around and seeing the attack damage go up and up, then quickly shooting onto the enemies is just so satisfying and it keeps me coming back for more. 

the map is also formatted in a good way, where every time you kill an enemy, get a relic and etc, you have to shoot a ball into the area you wanna go to, which sounds simple enough right? well there are still pegs on the board sometimes that can push you to a different route, and while that sounds inherently negative, i kinda like it because it adds spice to the game. and even if you do fail most of the paths just diverge to themselves anyway.

the actual balls themselves are designed to be fun and used in unique ways which i love. my personal favorite are anything with multiball, which adds multiple balls on the screen, the lightning ball, which destroys multiple pegs at once, and the summoning circle, which puts 3 of whatever ball is up next in your ball ring. 

and finally, there are also upgrades in the game called relics. relics are where the game starts to get good because there are some really overpowered/fun upgrade in here. one of them will give every ball in your deck multiball at the cost of a couple attack, theres one that spawns a squirrel (which is just another ball) after every 40 pegs you hit, and so many more. 

this game is a ton of fun, and i think that the main problem is that there isnt too much content in the game yet. there is absolutely still enough to play and enjoy the game for well over 50 hours, but there is still a lot to be desired here, which is fine because its in early access anyways. 8.5/10",1691210969,1691210969,True,0,0,0.475788146257400513,0,True,False,True

1296610,143167649,76561198210875113,0,7,609,0,303,1694813175,"I want to preface this by saying that I have played this game mostly on mobile and have hit Cruciball 8+ (its challenge modifiers, about halfway through) on each of the four characters. 
I enjoy Peglin, I think the game has a great fundamental concept with some interesting mechanics, but I would not recommend this game on PC taking its price into consideration. 

You will be purchasing a heavily unbalanced and frustrating yet cute and sometimes satisfying roguelite. If you enjoy roguelites, you will enjoy Peglin. If you are looking for a polished game that feels fair with every loss/victory, constantly encourages you for trying new strategies, and makes you feel like you're improving your game skill, Peglin is not a game for you. If you feel like trying Peglin's full version, purchase it on a mobile device. It is not worth the price here. 

The Good:
- I like the core concept quite a bit. A Peggle roguelite is just neat, and how its implemented here is also that - it's neat. The physics are consistent enough and many in-game boards are interesting. This is not perfect by any means and certain boards/enemy combinations are downright terrible (Spiders, Dark Encounters, certain Shielded Knights, Slime Elite, and more). But for the majority of boards, they feel interesting.
- Good runs are very satisfying. The rare times where you make things work feel fantastic. There's many intentionally designed synergies between orbs and relics in this game that feel great to use when pulled off. 
- The presentation is very cute. The pixel art is simple but enemies are stylistic and interesting, visual effects are fun and flashy, and all the little sound effects that play with each attack feel great as you build up power. 

The Bad:
- The early game is quite awful. Every single character has a nearly identical starting set of orbs (and two have completely identical sets? I don't understand that one bit) making every early game run equally boring with every character. This is a game where you have to heavily lean into the relics you get if you want a chance to win. But even with this, in the early game, many encounters are complete slogs of you shooting your orb at a refresh peg or bomb over and over while being forced to listen to the damage sound effect constantly. All while the game is at 3x speed. There's no interesting deviation and this 15 minute part of the game feels like you just waiting to start playing. 
- The in-game economy is counter-intuitive. After winning a battle, you have a couple orbs you can purchase, the option to upgrade orbs, or the option to heal. Nearly every run where you feel forced to heal, you've already lost. That option feels like you're being laughed at. Spending money here also stinks, since if you run into a shop, prices are so bloated that you feel unable to influence your run there in any way, shape, or form. Early prices are so steep that you cannot influence your run in any massive way early on. Lategame leaves you with so much money that you just look for a shop, buy every relic, shrug, and move on. It's not fun having to ignore orb after orb, upgrade after upgrade, and then losing to some unfortunate refresh peg spawn.
- Character unlocks take way too long. The unlock prerequisites are downright confusing. I've unlocked every character, and to do so, I had to do specific runs for them over and over to hope I hit some... big ""50"" number the game wanted me to land at. I didn't win a single one of those runs. This wouldn't really be a big issue to me if the rest of the game was as fun and balanced as I'd hope. 

Peglin struggles from an overall lack of player influence. For many reasons listed above, you dive into a run hoping to get out of the first act so you can start playing. The game makes most decisions for you, although it doesn't feel like that at first. In a sense, the entire game is like a pegboard, shooting your little orb down and hoping for some sense of success. And hey, sometimes it hits. But other times, you're running through ""?"" rooms denying events that have nothing to do with your run, mashing the fire button hoping for the board to change, or doing the same exact strategy that you won the past 8 times with because, hey, why try anything else if they're all worse?

I do not recommend this game in its current state. However, if the development team focuses mostly on rebalance and absolutely overhauls most of the early game, this could absolutely be a gem. I'm not too stoked there, seeing the developers sell plushes of characters and push out more content on top of deeply flawed systems. The game is in early access and I see its potential, but either play it on mobile or hold off on your purchase for now.",1690838009,1690838009,False,170,4,0.76993560791015625,0,True,False,True

1. New runs take a long time before they start being fun. Early pegboards and orb options make the gameplay slow and unfun and it kills my desire to play again.
2. The RNG on enemy encounters is a little too random. Some runs you'll cruise from chest to chest and stroll up to the boss. Other runs you'll get several encounters with a ton of enemies each. In the case of the latter, it will often end a run before you can really even get going (which means back to the slow, boring first area.)
3. There is no sense of progression. It feels very difficult (and up to chance) to achieve any of the character unlocks, and otherwise there's no way to start with better starting orbs, fast-track through the boring first area, or get some other kind of consistent character improvement.
4. Bosses that spawn in the same area are not as weak/strong as others meaning sometimes you'll get the boss you can actually hope to beat, and other times you're facing something with way too much health and way too much damage or that can only occasionally be damaged.
5. I strongly dislike the ""lanes"" mechanic where you can only attack the enemy closest to you and everything else is protected by the meat shields up front. Especially the tree enemies that turn into logs and block attacks after they die. It is not a tricky mechanic to play around--it just means your next couple of turns will ultimately be pointless (unless you are lucky enough to draw the right orb at the right time.)
6. Many of the orbs in the game are nearly useless unless you happen to get the perfect combo of orbs over  your playthrough. It feels less like the game is pushing you to step outside of your comfort zone and try fun new playstyles, and more like you are constantly just doing the best you can with a combination of orbs that don't complement each other.
7. I am ALWAYS out of gold when I get to a shop. Shop tiles should be removed, and you should be able to visit the shop between each encounter. Instead of just 3 meager orb options, upgrading, and healing, you could get more orb and relic variety to be able to actually have some slight control over your playthrough. 
8. The appeal of these games (to me) is the satisfaction of seeing the ball go on some crazy never-ending combo down the pegboard. It seems like most of the pegboards in this game are designed to inhibit players from hitting the perfect angle to get a crazy combo, or they'll just be schockingly empty. I understand designing them to be challenging, but a lot of the design philosophy at play seems to be ""funnel(s) for the ball to get sucked into.""

This game needs to give more ability to the player to make you feel capable and let you actually have fun. It's like a rhythm game where you only have to play one note a second and if you try to go crazy and do something cool, you'll just be penalized. You are too limited in what you can and can't do when you're already relying on some unrealistic and unpredictable plinko physics to try and fight battles. The player's resources are spread far too thin between how little gold is received through the course of normal play and how much gold you must funnel into new orbs and upgrading orbs in order to have any hope of facing a boss, not to mention any gold you might find yourself having to pay to heal since there are so few other ways to meaningfully regain health. 

My experience with the game so far is that even on my best runs, I feel like there was nothing I could have done to avoid dying at the end. It doesn't feel like something I can get better at and learn to have an edge to counter poor RNG luck, it just feels like I get really invested in runs only to lose because the game decided it was time, which is very frustrating.",1690827015,1690827015,False,2,0,0.499596744775772095,0,True,False,True

I feel like you get to a point where it doesn't matter how much skill you have. You just win or lose on pure RNG. Did I get a relic/ orb that can actually beat a boss in the first couple levels? No? Oh well. Hey you wanted to go on the obviously good path that has a bunch of treasure? Nah, have fun misnavigating 10 times in a row. Gee I can only get 1 relic no matter what path I take. I hope it's good. NOPE. Hey, got a good build going on and there's an elite you wanna kill? Lets have the refresh peg spawn in the worst spot humanly possible so that you have to throw 4 orbs doing 3 damage just so you can refresh a board to actually do damage. Oh you're actually starting to figure out the game and get further up the cruciball ladder (levels of difficulty are called cruciballs)? Welp here's 5 more cruciball debuffs to your game that make it absolutely brutal even with a good build.  OH you got a fun bomb build going? WELL super sapper is your last boss so have fun dying because you exist. Don't have any orbs or relics that let you take out a bunch of pegs in one shot? Here comes the Dragon where you helplessly bounce off the side of the mountain and do 50 damage to a 15k health pool. The refresh you need? Yea that's in the bottom of the middle of the mountain that you'll never hit without special abilities or orbs that never showed up in your run because of RNG. NGL, I bought this game once, got pissed off by the RNG and refunded it, but watching other people play it I gave it another chance. And yea, if you don't care about losing 10 times in a row to things that aren't your fault at all, this game is a 10/10. But holy nutballs batman will this game make you want to gouge your eyes out with a rusty melon baller if you want any modicum of control over what happens after you click fire. It's already super RNG in the fact that it's a pachinko rogue like; Why do I have to get d!cked by map travel, crap peg spawns (crits, refresh, etc), orb selection, relic selection, end bosses that completely counter certain builds that you could never know they're coming until it's too late, and super brutal difficulty modifiers? They've added so many different orbs and relics alone into the game that just getting a build that does one thing going before act 2 is pretty hard. Especially when you have 4-5 orbs that are useless (unless you decide to keep all the stones and get god like RNG)(ASSUMING YOU EVEN GET THE OPTION TO REMOVE ANY OF THEM BECAUSE RNG). All in all, it just feels really bad the more you play this game. If you want fun, never go past like cruciball 3 or pray to RNGesus for a good run. Hopefully they change the game up in some ways with some serious quality of life changes. I'm floating around cruciball 13 with all current characters and I just want to stop playing again after like 2 tries of getting absolutely decked by RNG. Make cruciball progression modifications less brutal, make builds slightly less RNG somehow (like being able to select x amount of different orbs/ relics that show up in the run since there's so damn many), and or let us know what the last boss is at the beginning so we don't waste an hour of our lives just to lose because OH WELL YOU GET TO FIGHT THAT GUY...

Game still unbalanced and aimer still feels random when completely still compared to Peggle. 


The new character classes may as well just be defaults with custom items and artifacts
 aka they added no new classes just fluff ways to make your refund time drop.


Also the way to unlock new characters don't justify their lack of uniqueness.

Its a good Peggle clone, don't get me wrong.

Keep in mind the custom modes was not a developer plan, it was a mod before it was a plan.
But the dev should add ""actual Classes"" instead of more merchandise fluff or excuses to limit the weapons and artifacts pool to various clases.
 
like a black hole placement class where the player can place a gravity well once per room (like the black holes found in the 3rd stage) 

or a bouncy wall class
 
or inverted level + more firepower class.

or a mirror class that will RNG the map travel to either left or right a 50/50 chance
on the map choices if you don't pick center road for traveling .



Or for that matter just give us custom save slots to create our own starting classes in customs mode 

Since its clear they weren't planning on New mechanics in the first place and were focusing on making $ off plush's.

The whole starting class is pointless, they should just be more orbs and relics, and combining them should dress the character up for added bonuses.",1653077766,1690366910,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Gameplay is basically peggle but each orb has different mechanics for how it interacts with the pegs, and you accumulate new orbs as you play or level up existing orbs to become more powerful. At the same time enemies will constantly be approaching along the top of the screen, you deal damage with each peg hit based on the strength / features of the orb and you take damage if the enemies reach you.

It's a clever and simple design that's very easy to pick up and addicting to play. The only downside is that there's so little content.

If you are hoping for a roguelike Peggle, this isn't it. The physics on the balls makes for very lackluster shots. Every bounce the ball gets extremely heavier to make sure more bounces are less likely. The levels are sometimes okay, but most of the themed levels are just designed to look like something and are not well thought out level designs for a Peggle-like experience. Peggle has various mechanics that make the game feel better to play and makes it more exciting to hit a lot of pegs in one shot.

Choosing where to go on the map requires shooting a ball into a hole with pegs blocking them in various ways, but that will often mean you don't get a choice in where you go. On top of that, there is often a fire pit hole where you will just take damage if the ball goes into it. Both of these mechanics are just anti-fun.

Random encounters will often have ""take damage"" on all possible choices. If you have too low of health, choosing any of said options will just straight up kill you and end the run.

Ranged enemies shoot you every shot and is incredibly unfair.

There's a small number of ball types that are fun, but the rest are not.

After every fight you can choose to get a new ball, upgrade a ball, or heal. All of these options cost money though. If you have no money, you get nothing for beating a level and it feels terrible. There is a shop you can visit on the map that lets you buy balls or remove a ball, but the cost of everything is expensive, so you will rarely be able to buy anything. You are likely to buy a ball or upgrade a ball every time you are able to after a fight, so you rarely will have money for the shop. Healing and upgrading could stay as a cost after fights, but the balls should be free. The shop could also offer healing and upgrading at a reduced price.

Overall, the many, many games I've tried of this have not even remotely come close to reaching the level of fun I have had in Peggle games. The game is just designed to not be fun.",1690161647,1690161647,False,1,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,True

It's unusual in the genre because of it's Peggle setting, but that adds some charm to the game, and frankly makes it less RNG and more execution-dependent than most deckbuilders, which in my eyes gives it more longevity. It's simple, polished, has a surprising amount of run variety, and will give you your money's worth.

Long version: Peggle is a very simple and straightforward game in almost every sense. It's easy to pick up and understand, it has simple rules and mechanics that are quickly understood, the artstyle is simple and low-demand (good.) It offers little beyond what it says on the cover: a deckbuilder roguelike crossed with Peggle. Weird idea, but it honestly works surprisingly well. Your 'deck' is the orbs you use to pop pegs, and they come in a wide variety of effects and even shapes. This variety is what differentiates your runs, for the most part; there's only so many different stage layouts per level, so eventually you will have seen every enemy combination, elite, and boss, and figured out more or less how to play the board itself. But adapting it to the orbs you have in question? That's where the game's longevity lies, because depending on what orbs you are offered and which ones you choose, you can have radically different playstyles. It's not always about clearing as much of the board as possible, and some orbs interact directly with the board in strange and novel ways.

So how is all of this executed? Frankly Peglin is very polished. For the most part, the mechanics are well-thought out, well-rounded, and clearly a lot of care has been put into making a large amount of playstyles both fun and viable. Bugs are very few and far between, and the devs have been good about quickly addressing them. Aesthetically, the game is really simple but that works out in it's favor; the visual style is consistent and fun, a lot of creativity has been put into the details of making almost every orb have wordplay of some sort, and the soundtrack is hardly amazing or memorable, but it's never annoying or disruptive, easily above average.

The devs are very responsive; early in the development cycle, I sent a letter detailing some findings about the game, and was more than pleased to get an answer that was clearly not a canned HR letter about appreciating support; instead the developer addressed several points of the feedback and hinted at how they might be resolved in future patches (and they were indeed.) That's a rare gem. Since then, updates have not been frequent but they have been of consistently high quality and added quite a lot of content to the game.

So are there any downsides? Yes, two major ones to my taste. Firstly, some encounters are in my opinion poorly thought out and cause unnecessary frustration. The most egregious example of this is the third level featuring some stages with portals on the board that cause your shots to gravitate towards them. Now, at times this allows for some clever play with curveballs, but most of the time, it takes away one of the core components of the game, which is controlling your shots and trying to make sure they hit what you want to hit, when you want it hit, and instead add a heavy dose of randomness to your shots (technically, portals are not random, and in theory you could perfectly calculate every impact of four portals on your shot at any point, but if you seriously try to claim that you could do just that, I'm calling you a liar.) Taking control away from the player when in all other cases it's heavily rewarded, does not feel good.

The second, and much more damning in my eyes, is the difficulty scaling. Like any roguelike and especially deckbuilder, this game has NG+ levels, the equivalent of say Ascension levels in Slay the Spire. In this game they're called Cruciball levels. And I have to admit, they embody the worst of difficulty design in deckbuilders in my eyes, particularly egregious in this game. At first it is simply a challenge, but rather quickly the Cruciball levels start taking so much power away from the player that they make certain builds and playstyles simply mathematically unfeasible. It gets to the point where each playthrough feels less like a test of skill and decision-making and more an RNG grind fest of resetting chests and elite fights until you get the relics that would make up for how terrible your starting deck, health, and gold have become. Now, take this with at least some salt, I am hardly amazing at the game by any stretch of the imagination. But I did give all of this a fair shot, I got up to Cruciball 15 (the maximum currently available,) but frankly about 5 of those Cruciball levels were forced. I did not particularly enjoy getting through them because every game felt like I was fishing for very specific things, otherwise I was at the mercy of a single piece of RNG going wrong on any given stage for 30+ stages (the crit only spawned in places you can't reach? Too bad, it's mathematically impossible to kill this elite before he removes 80% of your health.) On early levels, it takes a serious streak of bad luck to end your run. With the limitations each new Cruciball level after around 7 or 8 imposes, it could just take a single instance of bad luck which makes the game so RNG-dependent that it is no longer fun. More importantly, the game starts removing a lot of the mechanics that so much thought went into. You just get to play around and enjoy the variety the game has to offer a lot less, because you get so much less resources and so much less leeway. This all to me adds up to tedium and frustration, not difficulty. It's a shame because this game format offers a lot of ways of creatively adding difficulty, such as making individual encounters more intricate with different enemy types, debuffs, etc, but instead the chosen path is letting the player do a lot less.

I am probably being unfair to the game by dedicating so much text to the very few negative points. I truly think the game is a lot of fun despite the difficulties being flawed. Even if you only do a few playthroughs of each character's different builds, and go up the first few Cruciball levels, which feel challenging but not crippling, the game still offers a lot of hours. The core loop is really satisfying, the variety is fun and engaging, and player ability matters much more than RNG. Peglin is definitely worth the price IF you are already a fan of deckbuilders. Even if you aren't, it's quite a good place to start, and I would strongly recommend this game's base difficulty and the first few levels to anyone looking for a good, light game to pass the time with. My own playtime will very likely increase, especially with new updates, and I hope that the development team continues to be as creative and polished into the future.",1690005765,1690005765,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Really glad I did - the game is fairly extensive, full of charm, and has a ton of fun relics and balls to get. What I really like is how responsive the devs have been, regularly patching to help improve balance, clarify descriptions, and add new items and characters. Peglin has a few oddities - the way the map pans when you start in particular is just kind of awkward - but it's a fun game with almost always something new to discover or try.

In terms of gameplay it mixes plinko/pachinko/bagatelle with Break Out mechanics, all set in a roguelike setting. In a lot of ways it reminds me a bit of Slay the Spire, especially the way the map is set up. The devs really seem to understand what they're doing here, even when things aren't perfectly smooth there's a clear synergy in gameplay mechanics. It's even possible to get different core mechanics to work with you, if you know what you're doing, so you can hedge more if you like.

There is not a very meaningful sense of being able to do anything strategic turn-to-turn, other than discarding a crappy orb and aiming for your first peg, or first+second if you get a unicorn horn.  Beyond that, it's just chaos - you're basically rolling dice every turn.  Which means you should pick 'value' orbs like multiballs and magnet balls that do well in most situations.  There's not a big sense of speccing into a specialized build each run like you might have with StS or similar.  It also bugs me that a lot of the orbs are basically just pebbles that do something extra on fire, like apply poison or shield, which leans away from the concept of having cool interactions with the peg board rather than towards it.  The music is pretty stale, encounter variety sucks, and metaprogression is limited to a few character unlocks and arbitrary challenge upgrades.  And the puns are cringe, sorry.

But really the big thing is the passivity on the part of the player during fights, I think something needs to change fundamentally with how the player interacts with/modifies/influences the peg board while balls are in motion to make the game feel more participatory and less like an autobattler.",1689366473,1689366473,False,1,0,0.480769246816635132,0,True,False,True

[h1]Positives:[/h1]
- Peglin is very fun, and (to my knowledge) a very original concept too
- Peglin is also a very re-playable game
- The game also has very little to no bugs

[h1]Negatives:[/h1]
- Although very re-playable, there lacks something to reward the player after a run, in some games this can be as simple as a high score being saved while in others it's something more like cosmetic, there doesn't seem to be anything like this in Peglin, making the hours spent a little less rewarding to the player.

[h1]The Negatives No Longer Apply Much[/h1]
The Cruciball mode now gives something to work towards, in addition to the newly added classes, (although the classes don't take very long to get)

Updates have been nice, adding much needed variety to the game, but the replay-ability just isn't there. The classes are hidden behind an unfair unlock requirement, and even when you do get then they dont change the way the game plays in any meaningful way.

The gameplay is pachinko / peggle (the trailer is pretty accurate for the gameplay), so if this sounds fun to you you'll probably love the game, and if this sounds boring you'll probably find the game boring and/or pointless.

One major distinction between Peglin and other roguelikes is that there are very few unlocks: whereas in most games you have to unlock the vast majority of your items, in Peglin you start with every orb and passive item unlocked. The only unlocks are the other characters and higher difficulty levels for each character. For some people this is a turn-off, but I like that there is no pressure to play characters I do not like in the game.

if you're looking for review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Tacos recipe you've come to the right place,

ingredients

1 tbsp vegetable oil
3 garlic cloves, chopped
3 x 400g cans black beans, drained and rinsed
3 tbsp cider vinegar
1 ½ tbsp honey
1 ½ tbsp smoked paprika
1 ½ tbsp ground cumin

For the guacamole

1 small garlic clove
2 tbsp roughly chopped coriander
1 green chilli, sliced
2 avocados, halved and stoned
juice 1 lime

For the salsa

110g pack pomegranate seeds
1 green chilli, finely diced
1small white onion, finely diced
small handful fresh coriander, chopped


To serve

8-12 corn or flour tortillas
chipotle or other hot sauce
soured cream or coconut yogurt


Directions

STEP 1
In a large frying pan, heat the oil and add the garlic. Fry until golden, then add the beans. Pour in the cider vinegar, honey and spices along with 1 tsp or more of salt, to taste. Cook until warmed through, crushing gently with the back of your wooden spoon, then set aside.

STEP 2
The best way to make the guacamole is with a large stone pestle and mortar, but you can use a medium bowl and a flat-ended rolling pin instead. Crush the garlic, coriander and chilli into a rough paste. Scoop in the avocado with a little salt and crush roughly – you want it chunky, not smooth. Squeeze in the lime juice and set aside.

STEP 3
Mix the salsa ingredients in a small bowl. Heat a griddle pan or steamer and quickly griddle the tortillas or steam a stack of them to warm up. Reheat the bean mixture.

STEP 4
To serve, put 1-2 heaped tbsp of beans on a tortilla. Top with a big spoonful of guacamole and some salsa, hot sauce and a dollop of soured cream or yogurt",1688658615,1688658615,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,True

You cant leave a review if you only play the demo - you need to buy it.

This game is so bad I bought it, and let it run long enough to open the review option, then returned it, [u]just[/u] to warn people not to bother with the game at all.

The game is horrible.

Go play the game that it took its failed inspiration from - Peggle. 

Peggle has better sound, better visuals, better characters, better challenges, better levels - better everything.

There is zero reason to pay to play this game rather than just play Peggle Deluxe and Peggle Nights which when on sale on Steam you can get BOTH for less than 2 bucks.

Even when NOT on sale both Peggle games TOGETHER cost less than this poor copycat.

Now if you will excuse me I have a refund request to fill out.

[i]( A note to Steam :

People always need to be able to leave a review on a games main page (as some devs are clever to separate the demo version from the games main page) if they have played a demo of a game. It seems to be a kind of shady protection for poor games, as in, in order to leave a negative review it becomes necessary to jump through the hoop of buying the game and then letting it run first, before you can leave a review, rather than be able to simply leave a review after a demo?

This [b]will[/b] distort the review pool. Because, if you play the demo, and like the game, you will buy it and leave a positive review. If you play the demo, and do not like the game, [u]most[/u] people will just move on, and not [u]buy[/u] the game to leave a negative review.

- There are maybe 10-15 stages which you play all the time, so the game gets super repetetive the second+ run you play. 
- Sometimes it feels like the physics gets junky or some items just stop working mid shot.
- Items you get are nothing special. It could use some more interesting options to choose from.
- It would be good to have some sort of an indicator on how magnet affects the orbs, as it feels in some situation that it has no effect or is buggy and in cases where you think it will have no effect, the orb starts flying all over the stage.
- Lacks variety in enemies.
- Crit runs seems a little bit too op compared to other choices.

There's a few builds that you can set up throughout the playthrough. There's builds centering around: poisoning the enemy, dealing crit damage, utilizing a very overpowered orb to deal extreme amounts of damage, building defense, stacking buffs, and lots of double edged sword relics that can spice up the run. I would love to say that all of these builds are pretty fairly balanced, but I've ran into a few of the builds where even if I had the build pretty dialed in, I still found the game way too difficult and unfair. 

The two biggest examples of the games sheer lack of balance is the defensive builds and the crit builds. The defensive build in particular suffers from not having any reliable way of building up defense. The best orb is only 1 per every 4 pegs hit, which is pitiful on a lot of stages where you're getting hit multiple times per turn. It is made much worse that the tank builds give you no way of dealing strong damage; which is understandable, but you can't tank very well so it's a pain. The crit builds just suffer from not having a super reliable way of getting crits. You have to get way luckier with this build compared to others to take advantage of this build. It's kind of frustrating.

I feel like they could just introduce more orbs dealing with crit damage and then buff all the defensive orbs; then it'd be more balanced. The class that is centered around defense is so hard to unlock. You have to get 100 defense to get it, and the most I've gotten is around 50. It's really annoying.

Despite all this; I am very addicted to this game. It's extremely fun, and the builds that are actually good, are super fun to play with. I just hope they balance this game out more, and we maybe expand on certain builds that deal with buffs.",1685235092,1687692892,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I've gone back and played the game again after the latest update. I do believe we have received quite a bit in the way of even more peg upgrades, status effects, and RNG in some of the levels. I'm changing my review to a slight positive for the time being, but I'd really like to make this a strong positive. What we need now is more variation in enemy types, new enemies, a bigger lineup of potential end-level bosses (think maybe 5 would be good enough for each level,) and some variation in each enemy's HP.  Also, more achievements would be nice, if we can come up with some clever ones that aren't the run-of-the-mill ""checkmark"" type achievements.

P.S.--I've read some notes in previous reviews that you guys weren't going to add any new areas. Are you sure that's the right move? I would think four areas, perhaps even five, would seem more well-rounded and about the right amount of time to get through the game. Three areas may be a couple too few for the price point, and again, replayability is a HUGE factor in a roguelike's potential and popularity. Thanks for listening.

Thanks for all your hard work devs, we're going in the right direction.
(Original Review Below)

This is my first negative review. That being said, this is not a hard negative, but more like a slight thumbs-down.

Peglin has many positives to point towards---wonderful artwork, a catchy soundtrack, and an overall spirit of lighthearted fun.

However, there are several things related to the gameplay itself that leave more to be desired at this point in time. While the game is still in early access, I do leave Peglin open to changing the rating to a recommended status after more polish and content have gone into the game.

Currently, I really enjoy the Peggle-esque nature of the games rules and content. Peglin also adds roguelike elements into gameplay during every run, so you can start off with performance-boosting perks like adding bonus damage to pegs you hit, adding Overflow damage to your arsenal, (overflow means damage doesn't just affect one enemy at a time, but additional ones in the lineup) among many other relics that make each of your runs through the forest and castle unique.

The feeling I'm left with after ending a run in Peglin is one of not wanting to go back and try again, and I'm not quite sure why that is. The game does not have an addicting gameplay loop for me, and it could come down to several factors: one, there is not enough enemy variation and board layout variation in the levels to create a sense of RNG. I would think having maybe three different potential board layouts for each enemy encounter should be something to add. As it stands right now, when you get a specific loadout of enemies, they are exactly the same each time. Enemies also always have the same amount of HP, so you know what you're getting into. I feel this is too predictable, and feel like there should be a percentage range variation on each enemy you come across. For example, if a typical slime has an HP of 50, perhaps there should be a reasonable variation in those enemies HP, anywhere from 25 HP to 75 HP. Sometimes adding this variation can make the game slightly easier or slightly more difficult. It also adds to the RNG feeling of the game, and slight unpredictability which would give me a feeling of ""oh well maybe I'll get lucky this run.""  The way the game plays right now, you just don't feel that.

There's a few unrealistic animations in the game, but one that bothers me the most is the bomb mechanic. You can literally hit two bombs on a board in the same turn, but the bombs always land in the same place on the battlefield and they always do the same amount of damage. At least make the bombs centered around the enemies in the lineup so it looks a bit more realistic. This is a very minor nitpick from a gameplay perspective, but it is a glaring issue.

The Slime boss in the game is unnecessarily overpowered and is almost completely a surefire way to end a run. These types of issues crop up and can cause balancing issues for the player. A well-polished RNG roguelike game should have a feeling of incremental progression, where the difficulty ramps up gradually, with a few unknowns to keep you on your toes. But instead of being excited or a bit apprehensive about a boss battle, your immediate thought is, ""well, here's the Slime boss. Guess this run is over.""  This is something that should never happen in a roguelike.

I would also appreciate more enemy variation. We have a lot of orbs (attack weapons) in the game right now and I feel like we're doing a good job there. However, new status effects, new enemies, new attack patterns, and overall just a bit more randomization in the way the enemies behave would make this feel a lot more polished.

As it stands right now, I cannot recommend the game for anyone who is looking to get a bunch of playtime out of it, as quite frankly, it's just not addictive enough--and an addicting gameplay loop is a hallmark of this genre.

Keep up the hard work, devs. I'll be watching the game as it progresses, and if satisfied with such progression, I shall change my recommendation.

You can't try to get a certain build as well as you can in other roguelikes eg Slay The Spire, and it's not like you can work with what you have as well as in other roguelikes eg BoI, Gungeon. Each of the orbs you are offered do fun and unique things, sure, but they are severly unbalanced in terms of power. Same goes for the relics you pick up. You can pick up a relic at the start of the game that  genuinely causes your run to be lost on the first turn of the last fight. 

Plus, the game has 2 unlockable characters. This would be good, if it didnt take hours of specifically trying to get them. The conditions you have to meet to unlock them arent things you would just end up doing in a normal run, you have to go out of your way to do a build that probably wont win the run, and hope along the way you dont get killed and get the right relics or orbs to complete them. The fact that less than 10% of players have one and about 5% have the other is just poor game design. There isnt even a real reward for unlocking them either, the character choice barely change how the run plays out. There are no real unique mechanics for each character, no unique orbs, no unique relics. 

The game isnt inherently awful by any means, it's fun and cute and its definitely unique, and has huge potential to be really fun, but it just falls flat and feels really empty after playing over 2 hours. Hopefully once it's out of early access it gets improved and is rebalanced with more content, otherwise it just wont be worth it.

(Edit 6/17/2023):
After coming back to Peglin, I can safely say that the developers have completely fumbled the bag on this game. There is a lot of new content in the form of new balls, boards, items, and a couple new bosses, but very few actually improve the game's replayability and fun. Spinfection is a pretty cool mechanic, but aside from that, none of the items in this game synergize well with eachother other than the bomb upgrades. Most runs boil down to hoping that you get the bomb upgrades, and hoping that the bosses you get have a lot of bombs on their boards.

I still find cheat engine is useful for speed beyond what the developers offer but overall I'd say there was some effort to address the issues of the game. Its enjoyable without mods, would definitely recommend playing with mods as well.

edit: the concept definitely is cool and has a huge amount of potential but its being executed poorly, if this game turns into something more I'd be more than happy and will gladly eat these words.

original:
This game feels like it is developed by someone who doesn't play it.

1. You almost have to use cheat engine or something to speed up the game because otherwise you'll die of boredom while waiting for the ball to bounce between pegs and waiting for the damage animations to hit the enemies. 2x speed is what normal should be at, normal feels like the game speed was actually cut in half. 3x speed doesn't feel normal, but definitely makes the game fun if you already know how to play. 5x or 6x speed is useful for trying out builds.

2. The maps in the forest area are drastically different than the other areas in two horrible ways. A: they have barely any pegs which makes them really boring and if RNG hates you, you spend most of your turns hitting one or two pegs trying to get to the reset peg and sometimes depending on your progress, its better to just restart the run. Anything where the best way to play the game even casually you have just restart runs so often is bad (might as well just make a game where you infinitely go between menus if that is the goal). B: they have barely any pegs and if you get a bad setup when starting the game, might as well just restart because if you can't do something like clear bombs on command, you'll just die anyways.

3. More applies to the castle and beyond. Navigation is an illusion of choice. Unless you've cleared most of the pegs by the end of the round and never refreshed the board, you'll have a better chance flipping a coin than you will being able to choose your path. If you have a bomb build and by the end of the battles always have a lot of bombs on the board, don't even try to decide where you're going, you'll only be disappointed.

These are the 3 most common complaints I've had while playing but there are plenty more that I'd likely be reminded of after just a few games.

Playing with mods adds a ton of fun, but I'm left confused and frustrated about why the game seems to work against the player for no reason other than to be annoying. I played to the end a few times without mods before trying the game with mods and I wish I played with mods from the beginning. The problems weren't even ""early access"" problems, they were game design problems. The mods were the only thing making this game playable without getting unnecessarily frustrated at bad game design choices and if that's the case, I wish the mod developers were developing the game instead.",1654496625,1686815057,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I remember hearing some news from the devs pretty early on in its life cycle, where they outlined their desire to turn it into a high-skill Spirelike game, where they kept careful track of balance. I was disappointed to hear that at the time, since the Pachinko mechanic that the entire system is built around is not nearly as manipulable as something like a deck of cards, and I was worried that they were going to miss out on the inherent fun of Peggle's mechanics for the sake of some nebulous ""balance"" that was never going to be terribly possible to achieve.

Whether it was a change of artistic direction, or me misunderstanding the quote, I'm overjoyed to say that that is NOT what this game has become. I'm incredibly impressed at the amount of content Peglin has these days, from new characters to new bosses, to dozens upon dozens of orbs, each offering unique playstyles that you can mix and match. The core mechanic remains fun, and important, but has become more manipulable than it used to be, thanks to the addition of things the like electropegnet, morbid, or the concentrication. The game has fully retained its charm though the incessant use of spherical puns, cutesy art, and has an added challenge system for those brave enough to face down Cruciball 15. Personally, I'm still working on the Roundrel and Balladin's ascensions, and their identities are JUST distinct enough to keep it interesting, particularly the Roundrel.

I truly love this game, but it's not perfect. I think my biggest gripe would be how short it remains. Despite all they've added to the game, it still rigidly clings to the three-act structure popularized by Slay the Spire. As with all rogue-likes, I think the best fun you can have in this game is exploring combos and finding ways to break the game, which, while possible, usually only comes online maybe halfway through Act III. The most prevalent thought I tend to have after playing a game of Peglin is ""I wish I could keep going with this."" The announcement of the dragon boss excited me, since I thought it heralded the addition of an Act IV, but sadly, it was just an additional third act boss. Say what you will about the mechanics of Backpack Hero, but its loop system is incredible, using old locations and enemies, but ramping up the challenge SIGNIFICANTLY. I'd love to see something like that Peglin. As it stands, it's still an excellent game.",1686380713,1686380713,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Most ""build"" simply cannot works when you ramp up a bit the difficult, some totally break because of random event you have no control over it, some boss are downright impossible to deal unless you have a specific type of build (easy to notice when you start increasing the difficulty).

Boss, event, relic, stone you get, everything is random to the point you are just restarting stage 1 but you need to not get the slime boss, not get the random encounter with spiders or purple slime depending on your setup, get some correct relic AND ball AND money AND upgrade them. Because increasing the difficulty ramp up the HP so much, you need very high damage.

But the frustrating part is that this game has really cool ideas and amazing potential but without new stuff to unlock there is no need for players to play it again.

The game's severally suffers from being in early access. It's a rougelike with little replay-ability which in my opinion is its biggest sin, and the base game can be beat in less than an hour, and you can probably experience all the enemies and bosses in 2.

Another gripe is the gameplay itself. They have a whole lot fancy effects with the orbs and the relics that seem to be unique and cool but they all end up doing very similar things and leads to no real build crafting and without that you're left with peggle with extra vfx. I will admit some of the orbs are pretty fun to use but they are a very small few in a sea of dull unoriginal power ups you would see in a similar game. In the end you'll probably end up going into every run looking for the same orbs and relics as only a few are fun to use.

The game updates very slow as to be expected from a small team so there's no ill will there, but the amount of content added with each update tends to be able to be experienced all in a fresh run, so you are looking at a good 20 minutes of new content on every release. I thought this wouldn't be the case with the huge update that just happened, but sadly it didn't live up to the hype they were giving off.
 
My last gripe is the price. As the game currently is I'd say it isn't worth it and I feel it'll never be worth the $20 dollar price, as the dev has said they won't be adding any new areas so the game will have a total of 3 areas and the content they add to the game is very minuscule compared to other games out there with similar price ranges. 

In conclusion the game has a solid core and some good ideas behind it, but sadly they don't live up to what they could be and end up being dull and frustrating due to the fact you know they could do better. Maybe one day the game will be fully released and I can come back and change my review, and I'll gladly do it if the game becomes the game I know it can be. Until that day I can't recommend this game as someone who's been playing since the beta.

Goblin Protag
Adorable character design and art
Cool sound effects.

Cons:
Bad gameplay. Like a lot of roguelikes, RNG is super important. Almost too important, as unlike other roughlikes, you cannot get any bonuses to swing it more in your favor. Your Peglin run will easily be decided for you within your first few rooms. The adding of new orbs and events does not help if you want to 'progress'. Progress in this case is The Crciball which only makes the game harder, not easier. Playing with it will result in your deck be just made entirely of stones, and with the changes to shops, removing them will not be easy. Some encounters upon starting the game can result in death, no matter what you do, depending entirely on rng. It's just very punishing. If you find being hit with a club entertaining, then you'll love the current game a ton of fun.

Low Replay-Value. You will get bored fast. If you plan on collecting all the things, unlocking the classes, and maxing the Crciball, you won't be experiencing anything unique. You'll come across the same boards all the time. The enemies only do a handful of things. Some are unique but that's only in the last stage. Otherwise, there's just three types. ""Melee"" which walk towards you one block at a time, ""Ranged"" which will stand still and just shoot you every turn (or every other turn), and ""Flyers"" which move two spaces towards you, and have the ability to fly over their slower counter parts. The bosses for each zone are always the same. There's only 4 zones. There's like 3 miniboss encounters per zone, one of which is unique/interesting, the other two are just melee or ranged enemies that do more damage.

To unlock the new classes you need get the orbs with the mechanics related to the new classes and stack a certain amount in a single match to unlock it. And with the way orbs are so random and underterministic to get and how huge your arsenal of orbs can become, it becomes hard to acheive those stack requirements over the course of a game. Like, one of the mechanics makes killing the enemies faster, so by the time you are close to getting the stack amount needed to get the unlock, the fight is over because it deals too much damage...

Once you get into the higher levels of Cruciball (I'm ""casually"" currently on 13) it feels like it takes an absolute miracle to get through it (i.e. you just can't possibly do enough damage to bosses and sometimes mid-bosses to kill them), so I'm not sure how well everything scales in what I suppose is the end-game; while it shouldn't be easy, I wish you had more control over the direction your run-through is going beyond just reloading the save to cheese your Shop and Chest drops while you pray for an Orboros ? node early on. I also wish the other recently released classes were available to play on Cruciball, but I understand the tuning and balance might not be quite there yet.

It doesn't go on sale for much off but I wanted to try it out so bad I caved in, and it's awesome!  I can't stop playing this game.  I play it several times a day.  I hear the music in my head all day.

This is a game that you replay many times, not one of those games you only play once.  So if you don't like playing the same thing only randomized so it's different each time you play, then this game might not be your cup of tea.  But for fans of games with high replayability factor it's a no brainer.

So what's this game about?  Well, have you ever played Peggle by Pogo Games?  This is kinda the same thing only the amount of pegs you hit determines how much damage you deal out to the enemies above.  First, there's no real story though I imagine a little Peglin on an adventure and he starts in the Forest.  There is a layout of pathways between 3 different icons: pirate-looking skull & crossbones which means a battle, Question Mark which means some kind of random scenario like ""You come upon a large tree with something in a hole in the tree.  Do you reach your hand in? (take 8 damage) or Shake the tree, or Leave? "" and you choose one of those options, the third icon is a large G enclosed in a circle which stands for the Store, where you can purchase randomized selection of balls and relics.  Stores can sometimes make or break your game.  I plan my route and try to get to the stores, if I have money that is.

Battles consist of a special arrangement of pegs (not randomized but always the same for certain enemies) that you aim your balls at and hope it bounces around and hits lots of pegs before dropping down into the abyss.  Each ball has different attack numbers.  There's regular attack and then crit. attack.  Most balls also do something else, like attacks all enemies or can attack any enemy (choose before loosing the ball) instead of the default: the one that's closest to you.

There are 3 areas: The Forest, The Castle, and ...I think it's called the Mines.  There's about 20 or so places (I'm guesstimating, I should really count one of these days) to move to in each one.  At the end of each area there is a boss.  In the Castle there are two bosses that it chooses from and 3 different bosses to choose from in the Mines.   Some of the bosses are harder than others (the Dragon!).  

Once you beat the game you go into game+ where you have unlocked the Cruciball Lv. 1, and Custom Game where you can choose which relics and balls you start with, though you don't get any achievements when playing a custom game, nor can you unlock the two extra characters.  Yes, there are two unlockable characters!  And who knows what the Devs will add to the game next.  They just did an update and added new balls, relics, and enemies.

Music is great.  There are different tunes for each area and battles have their own music.  It's got a lot of variety to it so it's not boring and it's a long repeat too.

There are Achievements.  I have not looked at them yet to see if there are any super hard ones or not.

Overall I am super happy with my purchase.  I think it's worth full price but you can also wait for a sale to save a bit if you want.  So far 20% off is the highest discount I've seen.  If your'e a fan of Peggle or Pachinko like games and also like replaying over and over then this is the game for you, just buy it!",1685158298,1685158298,True,45,1,0.845281660556793213,11,True,False,True

When taking this game a bit more seriously, you notice how limiting and unreliable building your deck is, which is what makes this game fun. 
There's not a lot of quality of life features you would expect from a roguelike (such as seeing item % chances and random ecounter %s , a library of all relics and balls, or even detailed summary of your own stats in game).
There isn't also a lot of progression other than cruciball and the only ""unlocks"" there are in this game are two mediocre characters and the ability to use additional relics in custom mode, which is like a ""godmode sandbox godmode"".

Throw your orbs, throw bombs, defeat enemies and don't get killed. And stay on cruciball (ascension system) 2-8 if you want the game to be enjoyable, otherwise it's just rolling the dice until you get extremely lucky to grab a few relics/orbs that synergise well. 

I actually liked the addition of money system instead of upgrading or healing for free, it makes you think and plan what to do next during a fight or where to go in the map. Somehow it added some level of control to players. And player's control is my main complaint. 

You are not in control. You may think you are and you may assume that you know just the right angle to throw your.. well, peglin (?) during navigation to get to this chain of relics, still it somehow bounces through the board to the opposite site in good 30% of the cases.  
Recent update with new classes and new orbs and relics (were they supposed to be class-specific? Cuz they're not and different classes do not fell much {if any} different since the pool is the same) only made it worse.
I'm on cruciball 12 with the default class and on cruciball 8-9 with new classes, I don't see classes to significantly influence my runs. It's the same RNG-fiesta most of the time. 

I like the game and I have over 100 hours played, yet it's rather a neutral review, 4-5/9 and I'm leaning towards 4 tbh. New content is usually good, now it only brings more chaos. And it's not that I'm not willing to adapt to new stuff, quite the contrary, it's that the new stuff made the game less fun. It's even more random but much more predictable now. Get a few ballad orbs and a few more crits on the board and you're good. Get relic/orb that gives muscircle for every 3/1 refreshes and get rid of the crit? You're set.  

No more swings: ""Oh, this can be really good if I find this particular relic"" or ""It will be terriball if I encounter this elite"", you're better off just throwing stones and skipping relics until you find what you need and then you're OP, otherwise you're just dead in a few common encounters.",1685045378,1685045378,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Peglin currently has three available classes for your pegging desires, but more combinations can be made with the amount of orb abilities. The ability charts read a lot like Magic: The Gathering so they're simple to understand and fun to use.

The greatest part of this game has got to be the copious amounts of balls. As a connosieur, i'd even say a snob of balls.

For example: One of my favorite powerups is durable, but there's a map, the Pyramid when you're fighting the dragon, that is literally impossible if you have durable, because you'll rarely break a peg so you can't actually hit the center of the pyramid. So if you don't have a good refresh build or something else, it's just a guaranteed lose.

This game got a lot of its ""hype"" from the fact that so many creators played it early on. And it was fun to watch, because I could speed up the video. But the play is slow. Even with 1.5x speed, let's be real with each other - it's not that great.

They tried to capture Peggle but ended up just making me miss actual Peggle and realize that this is not Peggle, even if it's heavily inspired by it.

Lastly, there are interactions which don't really make any sense. Like the ability to get bulwark but the orb deals no damage. So if I didn't get any upgrades to actually give Muscircle or Spinesse, then the run is just over. I'm tired of seeing, and sometimes playing, games where the ability to win is deterministic on specific factors. And, what's worse, you have no way to know what you might face. Sometimes it's the Wall. Sometimes it's the crossbow. Sometimes it's the dragon. How am I supposed to win when my build is really good against certain maps and not others?

TL;DR - Could have been fun, but instead just reminds you constantly that this isn't Peggle and never will be.",1684967096,1684967096,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

They've updated this game a lot recently with added classes, balls and relics all of which is great!

Sadly they've also broken it in the process. The game is wayyy too hard to play right now and unless you're looking for Dark Souls Peggle this game ain't for you. I've just played 10 games in a row beating the first stage boss only once in that time (then died in stage 2). Before the recent updates you'd beat the first stage boss most of the time and have trouble on the later levels.

[b] Don't get the game unless you're confident you'll like what you'll get. [/b]

I made my previous review on Peglin when coins didn't exist, you could quite casually do a billion damage with the right combinations of relics and orbs, and when Cruciball was capped up to Level 7.

A lot of the points I had in the previous review still hold up with the current patch notes, but I'd like to go over some positives that the dev team have introduced first:
   • The coin system does provide a little bit of control with your runs, it's a step in the right direction.
   • Relics are now (mostly) different from eachother and actually serve a purpose. It's noted that Relics now have a rarity as well.
   • They finally added a dragon lets gooooooo there were a definitive 0 dragons even though they were mentioned

However, the main criticisms I have with the game still also hold true. Events are really punishing, with a lot of events (especially in the first act) forcing you to make really detrimental decisions for your run like forcefully adding an awful orb early, or taking unavoidable damage unless you'd like three more useless deadweights. There are a few events that do balance them out by being positive, but I find that I avoid ? spaces when I do a run because they are just that punishing.

Orbs are still weirdly balanced, while the dev team acknowledge that there were really undesirable orbs, they make them ""viable"" by adding a bunch of key-words to them that only make them conditionally good, rather than giving them some other form of uniqueness. (I'm looking at the Bramblorb and Infernorb in particular, with Bramblorb having a key-word that doesn't even EFFECT some enemies without any indication of not being able to do so.) Why not make infernorb instead light pegs on fire so that the next orb that hits those pegs (that are on fire) gain some extra attack while putting the fire out?

Finally, enemies are still very hit or miss, mainly because they are used as ways to blockade off specific builds. Oh, you have the Super Sapper bomb trinket? Good luck building around that and using it against the guy who gains strength every time you throw a red bomb. You're running a somewhat slow sustain/poison build? Gee golly I sure hope there's not a boss that starts rushing towards you before instantly killing you if you take too much time! Slay the Spire does have bosses like this too, but with that game, you're able to still play around bosses that go against your build if you play well. 

Peglin could be a somewhat relaxing and satisfying game, but rather than feeling good when you pull off a tough shot or being able to express yourself by making a cool build, you're instead constantly feeling like you're butting heads with the game to try and make things work. I want to see this game do well because it's a fun concept at heart and it can be really chill, but the dev team still needs to make a lot of smart balancing decisions and put in a lot of work to make this game a bit more servicable. A lot of elements feel very lacklustre, like the new classes, which just uses content that you already are able to play with and removes some aspects of it. I'll probably revisit this game in the future, but again, I don't really recommend it at its current state.

It's a little game that came out on Steam recently, and it is garnering quite the attention. I have to say, it's one of the most exciting releases I've seen in a while.

The game is a fascinating synthesis of two major gaming pillars: ""Peggle"" and ""Slay the Spire."" It perfectly meshes the fun of physics-based gameplay with the intrigue of strategic deck-building. It's got an addictive loop that speaks volumes about the depth and complexity of its design, something that might not be obvious on the surface.

Take the way you can synergize orbs in ""Peglin"". It's a small detail, but one that I find quite intriguing. It offers the player myriad ways to engage with the game, making each playthrough a unique experience. The game also features relics, which add further layers to the strategic gameplay, a bit reminiscent Risk of Rain. It's a feature that adds a lot of replay value.

Now, let's talk about the game's aesthetics. Its visuals are bold and colorful, delivering that sweet dopamine hit every time an orb strikes a peg. And the soundtrack? It's catchy, to say the least. It's one of those tunes that just embeds itself into your subconscious, continually luring you back into the game.

Despite its many merits, ""Peglin"" does have a few areas that could use some polishing. The game feels a little short and left me wanting more. It desperately needs a level loop (repeat from the beginning after defeating the last boss at an increased level of difficulty) or additional levels to maintain the challenge and excitement. Plus, more unlockable characters, items, and orbs would be a significant boon, adding an additional layer of depth and personality to the game.

Also, I can't help but feel that once you master the mechanics, the runs become significantly easier. This can lead to a dip in the overall challenge, making the game feel a little less satisfying for seasoned players. This is an area where the developers could surely improve.

""Peglin"" is an intriguing title that any fan of indie games should seriously consider. It's an exciting blend of strategy and action, with a few hitches that keep it from being perfect. However, the potential it holds is immense, and though I'm a master now - I still come back to it daily.

A very fun and at times very satisfying game to play. But doesn't feel like it has enough to offer for the current price.

This game has some amount of build-crafting that often snowballs into very fun (but often overpowered) builds, I especially had fun finding relics that allowed me to spam crits and super bombs which would trivialise anything that wasn't a boss.

But after beating the game on my second run, and experiencing only a small handful of new events, relics and balls on subsequent attempts, I just don't feel there is enough there to keep me playing long enough to justify the price (£15.49 at time of review). The game is currently far too easy and far too short, the 3 worlds fly by ESPECIALLY when you have a half decent relic or two. Part of me thinks that 6 worlds would feel like much better pacing for how much i paid.

With that, i'd also love to have a small amount of world building / story. I beat the game, blew up countless creatures/people/things ..... but i don't know why the goblin wanted to do that? I suppose he just has a bloodthirst and a need to peg.",1684378446,1684378446,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I did really like this game...once upon a time. Let me take you back to the ancient past, when wild youtubers roamed free, grazing upon the green grasses of early access games. It was in those days, a rouge like, simple and yet satisfying found its way into the common diet. Ah yes, Peglin was fun, runs could get overpowered, enemies and events were interesting, and the gameplay was truly something special and unique. Not every run was a win, but more often than not you could make something work.

A creeping death this way comes:

Update after update was churned out. New mechanics and relics were added to the pool, and with this variety... everything became muddied and samey. New relics added an abundance of... weakness. Every new addition made anything decent far more difficult to find and punished the player for playing the game. Congratulations for winning that tough fight, here are a bunch of options that either do nothing for you or make your run objectively worse. While this increase in base difficulty wasn't necessarily welcome or necessary, it was tolerable... but all that changed when the coin nation attacked. Cash, Mint, Money, It hit like a sack of coins wielded by a heavy weight MMA champion. Now upgrades cost you, healing cost you, relics cost you. You would be locked into a spiral: Take damage because your run is weak -> skip upgrades and pay to heal so you don't die in the next fight -> take damage because your run is weak -> repeat. When MOST runs ended up like this and mechanical skill was left by the wayside with finnicky controls and RNG hell, the writing was firmly plastered all over the wall. 

An unfavorable comparison:

In the binding of Isaac, one's skill means that technically speaking, with no damage upgrades and a single spirit heart, you could win (extremely unlikely but possible). While not all runs could clear slay the spire, or monster train, or spelunky, or dead cells, or rouge legacy... every run made progress| maybe an unlock, maybe a skill increase, maybe just knowledge of the game that could make the next run a little bit more likely to progress further. Here though, abandon all hope ye who dare to take a boss relic. When there is only one or two relics that can facilitate a specific orb working or vice versa, taking them isn't just a risk, it often immediately acts as a penalty as they come with inhibitors. Matrobshka might just end your run on the spot if you take it after the first boss fight, or your next relic could bring everything together and almost guarantee a win... if it is one of 3 within the entire pool of items, or an orb that you might not see the entire run. If it were one or two relics, maybe a handful, it would be fine, but with more often than not ALL boss rewards being risky, if not impossible to take with the damage spiral expressed earlier, one can not experiment, especially since you'll likely lose to the next elite fight before anything has a chance to show up. (side note* Lord help you if you leaned into survival to avoid the damage spiral and you come up against the wall boss, another guaranteed loss with no potential way to use skill to win). The current state of the game is active anti-fun, even winning works against you.

A future with bleak potential:

This game wouldn't take much to re-balance (and don't think the new characters help, their unlock conditions alone are heavily anti-fun, just check the forums), a few number and RNG shifts here and there would bring this game back to its glory days. That, however, is not the direction the game is taking. Every change further limits what works and makes the game just that little bit less fun. It seems it wants to become the ""dark souls"" of peggle while forgetting that DS isn't an RNG hell and that if you are going to have insane difficulty you need an insane skill ceiling. It seems that the definition of ""fun"" here is hitting the restart button over and over again and the ""skill"" is learning enough to not waste your time with 50% off attempts because they are doomed just before or slightly after the first boss.

Conclusion, DO NOT BUY:

If there was an option to  roll back the game to the way it was when it was first listed, it would be an easy buy. Even with how bad the current state is, the old game, as incomplete as it was, was at least fun. This... this game is miserable now, don't torture yourself and instead buy any of the other games I mentioned above. Maybe this game will one day recapture what it had but I have gone blue holding my breath. Alas sweet peglin, I knew thee well... Rest in peggle my friend.

Some boards are very fun and unique while too many boards are boring or frustrating.  
The world map allows interesting paths against navigation that is too often left up entirely to chance when it is vital to having an enjoyable (or merely playable) run.  
I like that there are a wide variety of generally interesting orbs and builds but balance is all over the place so you rarely get to experience the orbs and builds in a meaningful way. 
A total victory makes you want to play again, though losses rarely feel like they're earned.
The new unlock-able characters are behind overly chance-based conditions so by the time you get to experience what should be a new and original play-style, the system they should be introducing is used up.
The system of risks vs rewards feels unequal, for every event room you enter there's a slim chance for something great but a much higher chance of just being outright punished.
For each enjoyable aspect of Peglin, there seems to be no shortage of shortcomings to take away from them.

This is a rouge-like, therefore there is a large amount of RNG, you can see this good or bad, I think it's a generally good thing, however if you don't like rouge likes, the RNG will feel awful.

Played a little bit of the new content after having not touched the game for almost a year. There's still the same problems as before. The lack of consistency when it comes to dealing damage and creating builds makes playthroughs frustrating. I am surprised that no change was made to this system in the year since I last played.

You can add however many orbs, relics, bosses, or classes that you want, but if you do not fix the underlying lack of consistency, then the game is still as frustrating as before. 

---------------------

I bought this after watching some streamers and youtubers play it. From those videos it seemed fun, but what isn't shown is how many runs it took to get the content for said videos. The highs are high but the lows are oh so low.

There is no meta progression in this game. So there is no way to get even the slightest bit of consistency. Between all the random relics and all the random orbs you will most likely get a whole load of nothing. Sure, a few of them are strong - but when everything else is so weak it feels awful. It's too dependent on the loot you get. And this is just the base game - the additional ""cruciball"" difficulties exacerbate this RNG issue even further.

I feel that the game does not respect your time because you have to constantly play until you get that one good run. This sort of gameplay loop does not feel meaningful or fulfilling at all. At best the base game is acceptable to kill some time but there is not enough meaningful content beyond that to justify the price tag. I would recommend to wait for more content and balance changes before buying.",1656170741,1683950133,False,2,0,0.510305345058441162,0,True,False,True

[b]Balancing is completely off[/b]
The game has an incremental difficulty system called Cruciball. Simply put, at the higher cruciball level, it becomes clear what is viable and what isnt. Beating the 1st act of the game is harder than the 2nd and 3rd because most of the time you have bad orbs (basic boring Stones) and enemies have too much health. Setting up synergies isnt an option so you want raw damage instead of ""fun"" orbs. 

Most battles involve multiple enemies and you're encouraged to use Orbs that can hit seveal enemies (Bombs, Piercing...)
Most bosses however are single enemies with an oversized health pool where AoE doesn't matter at all.

As a result you end up rerolling the run until you get a decent starter relic (read: increases damage) so you can get past act 1 alone and that sucks the fun out of the game",1683918788,1683918788,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The last upgrade was a good start, but it wasn't enough. Before the upgrade you could do one run and feel like you've seen it all. They now added a lot of stuff, which is good and the game feels a little more diverse. But as others here already said, not all the added things are great. Why is it so hard to unlock 2 more basic characters? Why do you have to go far and beyond for that? Not to mention if you just play ingame and don't read stuff, you would maybe not even know that there are 2 more characters to unlock! And the new possible builds feel more than underwhelming. Having a orb giving you ballwark that maybe helps you block 5 dmg? When there are literally tons of items who can easily heal you up for more. Why would anyone want that. Ballution might have potential, but still you need to stack 5 to do even the same amount of dmg than a bomb (which would also be aoe while ballution only targets one). And then again, after two runs you probably encountered all possible events. I hope this game will get more stuff and upgrades and versatility, because it could be really really awesome.

Gets boring a lot faster than any other roguelite game though. Tons of items that add nothing to any build, so you're regularly skipping rewards or just taking something that doesn't help. Balance feels pretty poor overall, partially because of the worthless items but also because sometimes a peg layout can be extremely disadvantageous.

Sometimes you have to take 10+ shots to get a refresh that's tucked away and lose all your health. Sometimes you get terrible orb rewards and can't dps elites or bosses. And sometimes you are too powerful and end encounter so quickly that you get no money and can no longer add power, then die at the boss.

Really leans into the gambling aspects of peggle, which makes sense. But it makes the game more of a gambling/random outcome than a skill/effort game. Will you hit 100 pegs or 2?

unlike good roguelike games, this one choses to take all your skill and effort, and toss it inthe trash bc everythign is RNG, down to your oevery shot, items idt decides to give you, and then even choosing what pat you take after an event is RNG, you canjust litwrally get tilted sidwways on a shot, and end up in the exact opposite spot.

bosess have insanely stupid HP levels ( 6-8k for BOSS TWO ) and boss 3 has 4 pieces of 4 k EACh. and this dude attacks you every freekin turn for liek 12 damage. you are brown bread in a matter of 1 minute.

and ALL the bosses are the same way, with regualr encounters being randomly garbage bc the map sucks, the gimmicj isnt fun, and there's no steadfast ways to reple3mncish/upgrade orbs, or heal.

Hey the game updated! it added new mechanics, balls and CLASSES< OOOOO


so here's the problem
you unlock the new classes through unlocking STUPIDILY HIGH ACHEIVEMENTS


: dev team : we sweated and worked on these new fun classes for y'all to play !
also dev team : now stand on your head balancing on a ball on a ball on a thumbtack on a moving plate while havinf knives thrown at you, have fun! 



stupid new mechniacs
stupid new classes
stupid ways to UNLOCK the lasses to have way less fun playing them
stupid new RNG
less and less focus, more and more clutter - no way to clean the crap from your item pools - just have fun choosing 17% of all the orbs you see after battle.

I do not think I can really recommend Peglin.

The core idea is great, and they just had a big content release, which is great support to see. But while there's a greater spread of orbs and archetypes, your ability to actually control the composition of your deck hasn't scaled to match--with the base class Peglin, you'll have four orbs to choose from after a fight, but they're completely random without any kind of reroll available--if you're shooting for something specific, you can easily just have no good options available to you.

And while you do have all of those potential builds (if you get lucky enough to actually get the pieces for them)... the game doesn't really actually *reward* most of them. Ballution, the new poison build, gives you... mediocre-to-decent guaranteed damage on orbs that are otherwise hot garbage, with only one AoE option (which is admittedly good but also Quite Rare). Ballwark, the defense mechanic, comes in frankly *piddling* quantities. Your common option, at max level, gives... 1 Ballwark for every 6 pegs you hit. You are, optimistically, getting like 4 Ballwark. That is *nothing*. There's an uncommon that gives 1 for every 3 (so... 8 Ballwark)... but does zero damage no matter what. Wonderful use of a turn. And there's a rare one that actually gives you a decent-ish amount, but provides other disadvantages. And *none* of this helps you kill  the enemy because they exchange having good offense for a defensive gimmick that the game actively discourages. The later levels are so bloated in what they ask of you that you really need to have stacking offensive synergies to stand a chance.

But wait! There's classes focused on these gimmicks! Surely, they'll be better suited to making them work, with a narrower orb pool and different starting loadout. Maybe! I don't know! Because to unlock either of them, you need to do the unlock achievements--which require *50* Ballution on an enemy (a *ludicrous* number that frankly *requires* multiple of the orb that doubles Ballution, on an enemy with *high* HP, so basically specific Part 2 and 3 bosses), or *100* Ballwark, which doesn't have the benefit of a doubler, and goes away when you take damage, making it even *more* restrictive to pull off. You have to have a hyperfocused build, get the right boss, and *make* it to said boss with a build that is actively discouraged by the game. To *maybe* manage to unlock the new content. ALL WITHOUT ANY REAL ABILITY TO CONTROL YOUR BUILD. There's no rerolls, *extremely* sparse deck thinning, and in *all* of this you're at the mercy of the refresh orb RNG not hiding itself in a place that takes multiple turns of negligible damage to reach.

they did add new content, like new characters you can unlock, but they are really hard to unlock, at least the one that you can unlock by having 50 poison stacks on an enemy 
You can't make 50 in the first world because you'd need some poison orbs and not only the one that doubles the poison is RARE AF, but they cost money to upgrade so the chances are slim
Poison would help you get past the first world but you're screwed in the second world if you don't have AOE.
So how are you supposed to go AOE and poison at the same time? (maybe be lucky and get the aoe poison peg) but there's no other option, if you do go poison build and something else it will be hard to get to the poison pegs)
Not to mention how horrible poison is for the arrow boss in world 2, which seems to be the most common one (because I somehow got it 10 rounds in a row and I did check some reddit forums and it seems like this is a constant issue)
So you're most likely not going to get to world 3 by going poison alone or poison AOE, unless you're lucky af and get the orb I mentioned, I've played a lot for the past couple of days and I only got it ONCE. (and when I did, I GOT NO POISON PEGS XDDDD)
So then how in the world are you supposed to unlock that character? If you don't spam this game until you're lucky enough to get it?
it's too repetitive after playing so much and people get mad and quit because it feels like going nowhere 
characters should be easier to unlock and it shouldn't be based on luck so much

I get that the game's whole theme is Peggle, but the way it affects the navigation currently is just not great. There's no gain from this system other than the novelty of ""look, where I decide to go is even Peggle-ified!"", and so many times I got bounced out of an entire path that was clearly more beneficial by miles simply because i didn't calculate my shot and it's bounces all the way down to the 15th bounce with 100% accuracy. And with a game that is choosing to be a roguelike where you pick your path for different benefits, the novelty is not worth it. This problem has recently been made so much worse with the addition of shops, since it is now possible to get RNG'ed not only out of an entire path, but now into a shop when you had already recently spent your gold, meaning that you get NOTHING now, as opposed to the (still bad) choice of 3 orbs at the end of a fight, worst case scenario.

I still recommend the game, but bear in mind that this feature alone has me almost not recommending it.


Edit: after months of taking a break from this game because of how frustrating the navigation is, i decided to play it some more, since they added two new classes.

the way you unlock the classes is often pretty difficult, but only because you have to rely on having a VERY solid build specifically for getting them, and getting that build going almost kind of feels like its pointless to unlock the class, since the what you have to do is related to the class you unlock. 

For example: to get the class who's gimick is debuffs, you have to stack 50 stacks of poison on a single enemy. if you arent offered the orb that doubles current poison stacks, then your next best option is an orb that applies 6 stacks at max rank, which would take 10 hits on a single enemy (1 stack falls off each round), and the orb does some damage itself so unless its a specific boss that doesnt have many adds in the fight, its extremely difficult. Its only moderately less difficult with the poison doubling orb since it can target any enemy, but the only other orb that can hit any enemy and apply poison applies 3 stacks at a time, so its still an uphill battle. 

So you get this insane poison build going to stack 50 poison, you're enjoying the build, and then you realize that youre doing this to get a class thats advertised as some sort of debuff stacking class. But... isnt that just what youre doing now?

So you get the class, and see that it applies a random debuff with each hit. 1 stack of a random debuff. Not exactly strong, but it is nice, and you can pick up some piercing orbs. But here's the thing: to make the class worthwhile at all, you NEED pierce, and some debuff synergies. Otherwise it just isnt worth not grabbing the default class, since you will be offered one less relic everytime youre offered one. Which.. makes building around the class you chose harder..


Beyond that issue, there has also been some bugs that have cropped up but not been addressed as far as ive seen. These were not here when i last played, but i guess theyre here to stay now.

- when you break the shields that the knights hold by using bombs, the shield no longer fades away before you attack, unlike every single other enemy in the game. This results in you breaking the shield with bombs, firing a 100+ daggershot or something, and having all that damage eaten by a shield that has 0 hp and ignores any consistency in the game.

- In the mines level, the aim preview for your orbs used to properly adjust for if your orb was going to be influenced by the pull of any black holes. It still shows some sign of trying to tell you where your orb will go, but its very misleading. The worst part is that as far as ive seen, its hit or miss on if its actually an accurate prediction, meaning you cant simply be like ""oh ill just adjust the aim myself to account for the bug"", because it will be just as likely to not shoot how you wanted it to.

I've heard Peglin be compared to Slay the Spire - pools of relics, bosses, classes, etc wrapped in random run goodness - but despite costing about the same somehow that's about as generous a comparison I can make.

It's fine. It's a Peggle knock-off. Fair enough. I'd say, maybe about a 3 out of 5 mobile game. Which is fine! For a 3 out of 5 mobile game.

The much praised ""deck""/ball building system is still as shallow and prone to crippling random chance as it was far earlier in development. The replay is near non-existent, with the pool of ""random"" encounters being so shallow they might as well be openly labeled. You face the exact same very few bosses in the exact same very few worlds. You pick from a surprisingly small pool of relics, few of which being worth remembering. Ultimately you work to grind out special achievements that secretly unlock alternate classes in a desperate bid to find something different even if only briefly...only to discover the much promised classes are borderline identical.

Play the demo. Do not assume further playthroughs will be particularly different if at all. If you're dying for a 3/5 mobile Peggle knock-off still at that point, well, congrats. I'd wait until it's a full mobile release.",1682958847,1682958847,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Game is fun, casual and although there is a certain level of skill involved it's mostly about luck, in terms of picking up the right combo of orbs and relics. 1 particular boss was impossible for me (4 squares constantly healing) and I'm sure if you meet it with certain orbs & relics it should be easier. 

I suggest the devs to add at least a simple FAQ or gameplay basics in the main menu as it just starts right away without telling you what is what. I still don't know what makes the balls to be activated on both sides of the map symetrically for instance. I don't know what morbid is.

My only issues is that the price point doesn't match the content in the game at the moment as of v0.9.03, I understand that there's classes and new content coming but for right now the game wants $20 for 3 stages with very limited replayability. It's got a new game+ (I'm on Cruciball 7) that adds difficulty with each run, but after a few playthroughs, you get the gist of what items to take such as what enemies to face, what relics to take, what scenarios there are, and how everything is laid out for battles which really stales out the game IMO. Again it's hard to critique because it's Early Access and more content is on the way, but for what's in the game right now, you may wanna pick it up on sale like I did ($13.50).

There's supposed to be some luck elements in these games of course, but the balance between some relics and orbs varies so widely that a large number of them may as well be ""chance to get nothing"". I still think reloading as a whole is problematic and everything interacting with it is completely dead.

Recently added new characters supposedly, but locked them behind achievements that are a pretty unacceptable degree of RNG to get. Pretty disappointing, as what was supposed to be a ""big patch"" resulted in me booting it up, playing a round, and then closing it again to wait for yet another patch to try to fix some of the glaring issues.

It's essentially a run-based rogue-like infused with turn-based combat, with different stat and ability altering accessories that vary game to game. Your balls' abilities also vary in some really fun ways, from magnetically charged balls that will seek out special pegs on the board to behemoth boulders that smash their way through enemy ranks.

But the game falters hard in execution, particularly balancing. Experimentation in a game like this should be the fun and focus, as there are a lot of balls you'll want to try adding to your ""deck,"" for lack of a better word. But at the moment, there's really only one viable way to play and still beat the overpowered bosses beyond the first map. Oddly enough, that way of playing not only discourages you from adding more balls to your setup - it actually hurts your chances of survival.

Want to go for a defensive run? Tough. The enemies will do so much damage that even if you max your defensive abilities, you don't stand much of a chance. Want to try for a technical build? Sorry, you're not doing enough damage to wipe the monstrously huge HP of the bosses in time to avoid their equally monstrous attacks.

There are also some glaring technical problems with using a controller, at least in my case. When it comes to artifact or ball selection, sometimes moving the left stick does nothing and the cursor won't move. Other times, pressing A seemed to do nothing. On very, very rare occasions, it's even canceled out of the thing I wanted to do, as though the cursor were aimed at ""exit"" as opposed to ""select.""

The UI is also something of a mess. Why I have to click and drag a ball into a garbage can instead of simply pressing a button to get rid of it is beyond me, especially since clicking and dragging will at times launch the ball into play. I'm also not seeing any easy way to look at my artifacts apart from their nondescript logos on the side of the screen. Little things like this add up quick.

That leaves Peglin very much a mixed bag. But with patches, maybe there will come a better sense of balancing and basic quality of life issues. I really do like this game, but it needs some serious time in the oven.",1682620893,1682631722,True,12,0,0.645839929580688477,1,True,False,True

It's bad.

I almost returned this game after beating it on my 2nd attempt at about 90 minutes played mark.  Decided I didn't pay that much (on sale) and even though it was short, I'd still support them.  I did play a few more games, but also left the menu open for a few hours, so I probably have more like 4 hours of play.  

The good:  It's a fun and unique twist on a classic game (Pachinko / Peggle / Pin Board, the thing from before pinball).  Kind of reminds me of puzzle quest in that way.  

The bad:  
There's 3 zones which don't really cut it in a game like this.  Like Hades has a similar amount of zones, but the variety and content for each is far greater.
Kind of tries to have ""rogue-lite"" content but doesn't really succeed at it.  Plus, they give you a total cheat-mode option after you win once which really cheapens the experience. 
Super swingy on luck, which you can even save skim if you want.  But the result is you either get great things or bad things, and not a lot of agency in that.   It doesn't feel like there's much skill in building up a winning combo, as individual items are insanely good or insanely bad (and not much between).  I see evidence of combos that could exist, like stacking crit, but I doubt it's better than just picking strong individual items.  
Playing some more, I did see some new content, but overall, it didn't feel meaningful to play again.  Contrast to roguelites like Hades, FTL, or Gunfire Reborn, which tricks you into replaying the same levels hundreds of times without feeling stale.  

Suggestions to address my issues I mentioned:
Get rid of custom/cheat-mode and introduce actual rogue-lite mechanics. 
Change Cruciball from being debuffs on you to buffs on enemies. New Game+  is always going to feel better than ""Beat the same game but with penalties.""  Beating a boss with 10mil health is going to feel better than beating the boss with the same health but you have -1 to damage.  
Balance the orbs better, but introduce rarities where you could have a better version of the same thing to encourage you to do different strategies each game instead of making the same choices (ala Hades). 
Maybe have some kind of orb synergy or merging mechanic.  Like, perhaps an Orbelisk lvl 3 and a Orblation lvl 3 give you an ability that makes all stones and boulders be burning.  

Lengthen runs (either more zones or more content for current zones) to allow some of the ""build-planning"" seen in games like Slay the Spire or any of the other roguelites I already mentioned.  Again, I see ""builds"" that in theory exist, but with no real time or incentive to actually pursue something like relics and a bag full of Orbelisk boosting orbs, or crit boosting orbs. Allow selling things like Hades, perhaps, to create that same kind of tension about selling to try and get something better later, or keeping for its strength now. 

Make orb choices other than the big spammy ones like Chain Lightning, decent at picking up gold. Perhaps gold gain is a stat similar to damage, so some pick up like 1.1x gold and others pick up like .8x gold.  Otherwise every single run I'm picking up like 2 chain lightnings or similar, just to soak up some gold.",1682442656,1682442656,False,2,0,0.493108212947845459,0,True,False,True

The game becomes very repetitive after a few runs I'm aware it's a rogue-like, but it doesn't change enough between runs to maintain replayability.

Cruciball doesn't change the format enough to warrant playing and the game ends up failing because of this. With alternate peg-sets for enemies the game could potentially regain this, but as of right now doesn't manage to leave a lasting impression or make me want to return for more.

Took me only 3 hours and maybe 5 tries to get my first win. And without anything to unlock or to work towards, I see no reason to play another round.

Hopefully I can refund this game, but if not, I understand.

Wait for this game to get more development before you make the same mistake that I did.

The concept: a casual matchy/bouncy plinko-like game meets rogue-like deckbuilding strategy
The execution: a not very fun minimally ""playable"" experience (there's not much play in this ""game"", where your decisions are very loosely associated with effects).

If the core mechanic and loop were fun this game could still be something, but it's a bizarre loggerhead of ""strategy requirements, random tools"" - I'm honestly baffled by the game and don't understand the designer's vision. Perhaps the design constraint the designer applied to themselves was ""how to waste both their own *and* players' time""

Game also desperately needs the essential/basic QoL type of design decisions like ""confirmation button"" or ""undo purchase"" and such.

Perhaps it'll be repaired before early access ends but... I wouldn't count on it. The fundamentals of the game are wildly confused; ""high accountability with low autonomy"" is a phrase that more or less means ""maximal unpleasantness.""

I have high hopes for the future development of this game. It combines elements of chance through Plinko with deck-building and dungeon-crawling akin to Slay the Spire, which is as refreshing as it is unique. The enemies are challenging, and the unlockable levels of the Cruciball mode add further challenges after each successful run. In addition, the option to speed up the entire game is a nice touch that helps with the grind.
Negatives are few and far-between, outside of the normal frustration of difficult battles. I may argue that more goblin classes, relics, or more orb types could add further variety to the game, but there is absolutely plenty of variety in the current state.

1. Somehow, this has less content then Poggle. I know, it's shocking. Yes, it is early access, but holy hell- For some reason instead of things like stages, mechanics, and items - The dev is just like ""Eh, you know what? Let's just ramp the difficulty up and make that the primary focus for replayability. Oh, and that difficulty ramp should just be annoying and boring, like adding more base stones or increasing min-boss encounter rates!""

2.  What is there for the most part is good. There just isn't much of it. Maps need a variety of more nodes, some orbs/relics are straight up garbage that should just be removed from the game, but despite that, the base feel of the game is fun.

90% of the time, my ball isn't even stuck, it's just going too slow for the game's liking and then the pegs disappear. This is a problem because it affects a whole slew of things like combos, drop locations, and overall damage.

Peglin follows the Slay the Spire formula, but isn't finely tuned enough to make it shine. Instead, the StS formula holds Peglin back from achieving its potential. The overall systems encourage deck building and shifting your strategy as you go, but Peglin's combat seems to actively punish going all-in on a single strategy. This is because the game has so much inherent randomness that no matter what ""build"" you aim toward, the best strategy will always include the same few items. 

That randomness is also applied to the map navigation, which can be incredibly frustrating at times. 

You could argue that it's not ""randomness"" because yes, there are ways to mitigate it. That is, get Unicorn Horn to expand your ""aim line"" and clear each battle stage more completely to maximize your chances of going where you want to go. There are times though, like right after a ""?"" stage or a chest stage, where you really are just up to The Lord's Mercy.

There's also a NG+ system similar to StS Ascension: The ""Cruciball"". However, the first few levels have done nothing to noticeably change the game. 

Again, I really don't know why they chose to mimic StS systems so much. StS works because you are given incredible amounts of information, and lots of agency to act on that information. Peglin gives you that information, and acts like you're supposed to use it to your advantage, but your ability to do that is restricted by RNG, and the difficulty isn't high enough to warrant the risk of specializing into a specific strategy.

I have really started enjoying cruciball, game mode that stacks multiple set negative modifiers to make the game harder. It has given a lot of value to items and orbs I had considered worthless, or unimpressive on the default difficulty.

The game is at its heart a deckbuilder though, so if you don't enjoy thinking in advance and having multiple build options to account for RNG you will likely not enjoy cruciball. Which means the game will feel pretty light on content for its price.

Whenever i try out a game and it keeps me entertained for so long its a win in my book

You are a little gremlin who collect orbs to throw around to do damage to enemies
the only thing you control is the direction the orb is thrown in a 360"" angle
there are many different ore's with special abbillities different enemies and at this moment 3 worlds
Every playthrough is different and everytime you win a round. it gives a bigger <optional> difficulty that gets higher and higher everytime you win

The Good Stuff:
-There are many items that help you on the way, so many that every run feels different
-Good and adicting gameplay, you just wanna unlock more difficulties
-simple and easy to play

The ""Bad"" stuff
- For looking so simple €16,49 feels a bit expensive. in the end i found it still worth it, but it is on the pricey side
- The music really gets repetitive quick, glad there is an option to turn it of
- It's hard to stop playing, there are moments when you loose and think, ""But that was unfair"" and you start another round. and before you know it, you are playing this game for hours and hours

Things i would like to see in upcoming updates.
- More items, The more items are added the more different each round will become (this also includes more orbs)
- More different enemies. Elemental weaknesses, special strenght's to some, just a bit more variation to our baddies, (this includes also more bosses)
- More worlds, maybe even a pick a path, this would make the game feel 10X bigger

In short, i found this game amazing. and still play it allot. this is a good example that even simple looking games can be amazing.

The game can be beaten in your first run, which will only take less than an hour. After that, you beat the game. There is a bit of replayability with there being multiple possible bosses per floor, and there is a challenge feature where you are able to play the game with harder settings. However, there just doesnt feel like enough of it so far. if you've played for 3-5 hours, you've seen everything. There are more games out there with hundreds of hours priced at $15. I feel like it would be more fair to price this at $5.

So far this review sounds like more of a down vote. But don't get me wrong, this game is EXTREMELY fun and addicting. There are a ton of combinations of weapons you can use, there is text based events which i personally like a lot, the music is calming and descent, and the game is aesthetically pleasing. A very good option if you want to play a rogue-lite but want it a bit more relaxing. There is a ton of potential to this game and the devs are still adding content every month. This game deserves a bit more popularity than it has now honestly. There are more classes being added to the future and more relics thankfully.

Of course, this could easily be rectified by playing more than 2 hours of the game.

The orbs don't really affect much of the gameplay, the gameplay doesn't make sense as to how attack damage is dealt (maybe I'm just unobservant idk), the RNG is a little wonky, the paths are generally the same regardless of direction you head, and the thing that got under my skin (as pedantic and nitty gritty as it is, I'm sorry) at the end of the most recent playthrough were the imitation SquareEnix menu sounds that get way overused and have way too much echo/reverb on them for my taste.

The game isn't bad but it needs some serious balancing cause even when everything falls into place and all goes well one minor inconvenience ruins the entire run.

to add more info I'm on crucible lvl 12 and it took a couple hundred runs to get from 11 to 12 just to get the right combo of items and encounters. The slime boss is unbalaced as the peg layout make it way to hard to rack up enough damage especially once he reaches you. one other thing is there is to many ranged units in the first map that chip away at your health forcing you to spend money on already nerfed heals or alternatively leaving you with no health for the boss, reducing their spawn but not eliminating would be ideal as I have had 3-4 encounters in a row that add up to a lot of damage.",1677984450,1678082135,False,4,0,0.512296199798583984,1,True,False,True

I agree with what many others have said.

- need more balance between luck and skill, especially if you get some run winning randoms you can get to the end and win and be kind of confused how you even won without trying
- needs more length to be sure
- I did not purchase a single item from the shops because upgrade and battle wins felt easier for me to access
- try to make the map path choicing a little bit more random or varied. It's kind of like Inscryption, except with Inscryption I felt a genuine strategy and anticipation of something sort of unexpectef happening while traversing the map.

On one edge, its the appeal of the game - it takes the simple, casual game of Peggle, and gives it some layers to make it feel more like a fleshed out game rather than something you'd play on your phone for a few minutes. 

On the other, this means that unlike other roguelikes, there's very little mechanical skill involved, so how well you do is determined instead by a roughly 50/50 split of decision-making and luck. Once you know what items to get and how to make the most of them, you are just looping runs until you get good items. Bosses are nothing more than a check to see if you've gotten good items - if not, gg, try again. 

There's no changing this. If they made the gameplay more skill based, it loses the appeal of being a pretty brain off game with enough substance to feel worth playing.

Its fun and easy to pick up, but it is still in early access and has some problems. After the last few patches, it feels like the balance has been changed and its near impossible to win a Cruciball run (similar to Ascension runs in StS). Especially for the final bosses on the higher Cruciball levels. You can have a near perfect run through each level, but then be taken down by the final bosses as if you had no upgraded orbs or relics. 

There are alot of different orb types and offensive, defensive, and special relics. This could be just my luck, but unlocking some of the special relics through specific events seem to never happen. I can get through part one or two of these special events, but never reach the final part. And on the next three runs, I run into the final event over and over but not get the first part.

I don't think the game is too expensive. You can get a good amount of time and enjoyment out of it (and some frustration that come hand in hand with rougelikes).

More content is being added, but it doesn't make the core game better. Whether you have any control over your situation is up to the whims of the physics RNG and the item RNG. I'm probably come back once more a long while from now (cause I forgot how infuriating it is), try it, and just hide it from my steam library.  
I literally cannot have fun with this because I see so much potential. And the devs are just letting it sit there, neglected. 

There's some promise here. But as is, the game is **WAY** too infuriating too often. There's a focus on the boards being quirky or having interesting mechanics. Sometimes it adds to the game. A lot of times, it causes you to be literally unable to hit 90% of the board without wasting 3 or 4 shots to start. Even better is when you've cleared most of the board and the SINGLE refresh peg is hidden behind 4 or 5 other pegs that can't be cleared in 2 or 3 shots, let alone 1. 

And given how imprecise the aiming controls are, and how even the smallest of differences will give you effectively random results, it doesn't *FEEL* like the game rewards skill. I expect the game will improve as it approaches release, but as is now, I cannot recommend this game. Just stick with the demo for now.

Edit: I've let 2 or 3 updates happen in about 2 months. It's not any better. The balance is non-existent, it feels like you have no control, your options are more or less all completely random.  The degree to which so many of the design choices in this game offend me makes me want a refund.

The cruciball mode is profoundly un-fun and encourages playing in a boring way, and it has literally no rewards for completing it, so I recommend you ignore it altogether. There's a lot I would personally change:

- Shops are too expensive compared to ball upgrades and purchases, when you can upgrade balls anywhere and get relics for free from chests, especially since you won't be fully upgraded until the final zones. A lot of the time they feel like a dead space, which is a massive penalty.

- Too many relics are far too weak to be worth taking, as you need good relics to win a run.

- There are a few relics that are too strong (Electropegnant and Molten Mantle spring to mind as the two clearly gamebreaking ones)

- The game ends at what feels like it would normally be the 1/3rd mark.

The four boards boss battle is literally impossible unless you have hit the lottery. Even with perfect optimal synergy and play from start to finish, you simply can not beat the 4 boards boss. The developers seem to have skipped on some simple high school math as the 4 boards get +1 muscircle every turn. To those that don't know, whenever you scale something through the partial sums of linearly increasing terms, it scales by the quadratic. So the rate that one loses HP is by the quadratic. Healing at best is only linear so no amount of healing can get you pass 10 turns of that boss. The few cheese combos I know that allows you to beat anything pass crucible 11:

1) Bad Cheese Relic, Round Guard, getting to one orb, (Well done Steak if using Orborus)

2) Molten Mantle, Refillosopher’s Stone

3) Critsomallos Fleece, Reorbanizer, Duplication Potion


I think the worst part of the game is just the awful boss relics. There are 16 boss relics and only one boss relic gives you a legitimate shot at the 4 boards boss. 5 of those boss relics are just plain awful. Like consuming chalice that removes one refresh orb for +0/+4. The rate at which the game scales makes consuming chalice the most detrimental relic I have ever seen. Cursed mask gives orbs +2/+3 while having a negative status effect. The given confusion status effect only lasts 4 turns and most battles last more than four turns. So you are just firing orbs for four turns like you are drunk and then nothing else.

There are a lot of unique games and concepts, and especially in the roguelite genre, variety is plenty already. Yet Peglin manages to take things to a whole other level. Obviously, pinball is nothing new. It's a classic arcade game, and even though I have never been very interested in pinball as a concept, Peglin still intrigued me...

And it doesn't disappoint. At least, not in the important aspects. Let's start with the very basics - the gameplay. Peglin takes Pinball to its extreme. It combines concepts like crits, busted balls, and different relics that help diversify your gameplay and take it to another level. As long as a run goes well, there is a chance you will be incredibly busted by the time you beat the final area. Amazingly, it feels as though you are 'cheating' the game in a way, as though you're not meant to be dealing thousands of damage by just hitting a 'Matryorbshka' enhanced by the relics you picked up along the way. It feels like 'cheating', but I feel like its designed to be that way. Power trips like these are truly beautiful.

Speaking of 'Matryorbshka', word play is literally scattered all over this game. Even after hours of playing this game, some of the names still put a smile on my face. Down from the different orbs you can collect, to the relics, all the names are pretty clever. It is clear the developers put a lot of thought into that aspect, and though it may not seem like much, I really appreciate it.

With the addition of gold, and other updates to the game, Peglin keeps getting better and better. It feels fun and fair, and though some relics are far better than others (excluding the boss relics that are meant to be even more powerful than regular relics), they all have a place in the game. Some builds can be a lot harder to properly set up - like bomb builds or morbid builds, but they're that much more rewarding once you get the ball rolling.

And if you're looking for a real challenge, the game has got you hooked up with that, too. The Cruciball difficulty settings that you unlock as you beat the game on the previous difficulty get progressively harder and make for a truly difficult gaming experience. Personally, I find the game is best enjoyed on Cruciball 4-5, that way its not too challenging but also not a ball in the park.

 I need to stop mentioning balls.

In all seriousness, Peglin is a terribly fun game that I can see myself playing more of, especially as the developers put so much effort into expanding the game and improving it. I do know that there was a time when players were generally unsatisfied with the changes being made, however I didn't own the game at the time and couldn't see it for myself. From what I see now, none of the changes or additions seem to be anti-fun. As long as this continues, I don't see a reason not to recommend the game! Hell, despite the game still being in early access, I am already incredibly satisfied with the way the game as it is right now.",1674410560,1674410560,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Some things need fixing, like the janky physics. There is something not quite right with how the orbs roll, bounce, and react to the pegs, and this becomes much more apparent with certain power-ups. Hopefully they will fix the physics / hitboxes in the future.

There really is something addictive and enjoyable about the gameplay even as it is now. I DO believe that Peglin could be improved and refined enough for me to recommend the game at some point but as it stands currently there are a few too many issues I have with it. 

For starters, many of the item descriptions are just too vague to understand. On multiple occasions I've picked an item to try and figure out what it does because I couldn't discern that information through the description alone, only to find myself equally confused after using it. Simply put, things need to get explained better. 

Secondly, it's too easy to screw with the game if you don't like the outcome of a battle, your rewards, or the options given to you in a chest. If you quit out of a game like Slay the Spire you will resume exactly where you left off, with the same items offered to you. I definitely think Peglin would benefit from that kind of design since it's just too easy to redo any situation you don't like.

Finally, I realize the game is in early access right now, but there's just not a lot of content available yet. I hope that the developer(s) can iron out these issues soon and I'll be returning to the game sporadically to see if things have improved enough to where I feel comfortable recommending the game and changing this review.",1674149912,1674150400,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Figured I'd leave some feedback and suggestions, I'm not too sure what's already confirmed to come and what's not, buuut hey. And yes, I realize this game is still in Early Access.

Overall flow of the game is great - so are all the pegs and powerups so far! Clearly many different ways to play it, but not gonna lie I veeery, very often gravitate towards some sort of ""upgrade the board"" and/or ""refresh to heal"" sort of build. I always make sure to have atleast some sort of way to heal, whiiich is probably fine and obvious to have, but it did leave me hoping I could just use more money to heal more. Too often I just find the orbs and relics I know that will work, upgrade em, and then just... fiddle around with the rest of the money. Especially if and when the game decides to not give me a single shop (a single guarantee, please? might already be the case though).

My first run was a cakewalk. Aaarguably I had some information from the mentioned Youtubers/streamers sure, but there were still many new things I hadn't seen before, such as the whole Morbid thing. I had some sort of Electropegnet + Defresh potion setup going combined with pegs or relics that upgrade pegs whenever a hit is made, There were definitely a few moments where Morbid and the peg upgrade working together felt real cheesy, but hey, that's kind of the name of the game with all these Roguelikes, finding fun ""broken"" interactions. Still, it left me thinking there are deeefinitely some things like that I feel like could be balanced a bit better. Maybe adding a floor or two more between the current ones could do the trick, to make the difficulty curve a tad less steep.

I'm also definitely hoping not every peg type or relic will be available from the start in the final game. I'm assuming this will be the case, but it does feel weird it isn't the case in the Early Access version. Still, I'm looking forward to unlocking new things and playing around with them, maybe be forced to use the weaker orbs instead of just passing on them each time.

Other than that a few small things I'd also like improved. The fadeout between screens sometimes gets stuck when the game starts to load the next screen but the screen isn't 100% black (only like 80-90%), and it would be great to see how many bombs I've hit in a turn instead of trying to guess from the goblin fella throwing tons of them. The minotaur miniboss whatever also has a little glitch, if it gets both a chargeup and attack turn during your reload the damage will happen before it actually does the attack animation, actually happening when it starts charging up. Other than those things I'm hoping there will be relics to influence the enemy attack and movement patterns, stuff like slowing their movement down or making them attack more rarely, stuff like that.

More everything from playable characters/classes to floors to boards to enemies to pegs to relics and this game will be amazing.",1673958542,1673958542,True,1,0,0.50740736722946167,0,True,False,True

Please play Peglin and Peggle side by side and notice the differences. In many ways Peglin is actively getting in my way of making a shot. If the mouse cursor goes off the play window, like when you are making a high angle shot, you instead start highlighting the enemies and are no longer able to shoot your ball, you instead have to move your mouse even closer to the character which makes finding the right angle even more difficult. There is no mousewheel or hold ctrl+right/left to make minute adjustments. Again, I don't know how much of this is osx, and there being support for actual mice and this is a dev oversight, but not all of it can be. Additionally, the peg board is way too small, there are all these side bars with information that, while important, would be better hidden and only show up when you move your cursor to the edges, that way the board could be much better. I have beaten the game twice so far, in spite of the aiming bug; on a trackpad you never have any semblance of accurate aiming of your ball, it will skip entire sections of a peg, skipping either way, but if I move it quickly and try to reset it, then I can get it to rest on a better angle. It's totally busted. That said, there's a lot I love about the game, but for a casual game I really want it to run on my mac and not my pc.

edit: Confirmed, this game is bugged on macos and trackpads, it skips and doesn't allow you to position everywhere. It also loads really slowly on my modern pc but it does allow you to aim correctly.",1672098641,1673575349,False,2,0,0.525179862976074219,0,True,False,True

Like most games in this genre, RNG is a major factor and you will either find that you are speeding through encounters or getting demolished.

One main issue you will probably run into is getting rid of orbs you no longer want. It is possible but not consistent so be careful about what you choose.

Peglin is a great Peggle style game with added RPG elements. You move along a branching over-world map with each branch decided on which route you choose by firing your Peglin Ball down the gutter of preset paths at the bottom of each board. You are awarded with gold each coin peg you shoot and various balls you can unlock/buy through progress. Any relics unlocked in the campaign are unlocked for the custom run mode as well allowing you to master your skills outside of the campaign. Each ball type has different stats and abilities allowing you to focus your Peglin build however you choose to defeat the enemies. With it's timeless pixel art and addictive puzzle/RPG game-play I'd say this game is a fine choice for those who wish to combine turn based RPG's and Peggle.

However, Cruciball 15 feels virtually impossible unless you get Orboros or some other crazy single-target synergy very early. I only managed to clear Cruciball 12-15 by having Orboros in each run. I also think some of the boards need to be redesigned.

Take the Act 1 slime elite for example. It's hard to average more than 10 pegs per shot, which almost never clears through the ~1000 hp spread across the slimes. Also, the new Act 3 boss is so much harder than the QR code boss. The mine sweeper theme is cool, but the board that is left after you clear the boxes does not have enough pegs, especially when it's spawning time-bomb enemies every turn. 

Cruciball also ruins a lot of relics, mainly anything bomb related. -15 damage on bombs makes bomb synergies useless until you get 4 or 5 of the important pieces, which just isn't worth going for. 

Lastly, there's a way to cheat events and fights. Just quitting to menu and returning to the run will bring you back to the start of the encounter, and the RNG for orb order and events changes.

A full run takes about an hour, but each one is almost guaranteed to vary wildly based on the orbs and relics you choose to accumulate throughout each run.

The core mechanics are simple, but the real charm comes from how behaviors of orbs with the levels change based on the relics you have. One of my favorite combos involves a maxxed out Matryoshka Orb, coin modifying relics and the Molten (something, peabrain memory) Relic that prevents you from gaining gold for the rest of your run, but applies your current accumulated damage to the selected enemy for every few coin pegs you hit. Its fun to watch it spiral out of absolute control.

It's Peggle with some simple Rogue-ish/RPG mechanics baked in. At its best, it's an extremely addictive and satisfying spin on the puzzle game, with potential to break into that super-digestible zeitgeist market (e.g.: Vampire Survivors). The kind of game your friend who doesn't play games plays, but is still deep enough for you (a person reading Steam reviews) to get something out of. While I haven't hit any noticeable bugs, there are a few things that do feel like they need addressing. My two biggest gripes are pacing and content. 
Content will obviously be addressed over time, but at the moment it's feeling pretty light. I look forward to new characters who have different starting perks and orbs that will hopefully feel different, but I'm even more interested in new maps and enemies. I've had a few successful runs at this point, and it's really starting to feel like I've seen all there is to see. The fact that you move through the three maps in the same order every time does make it feel a bit routine. I'm not sure if more randomness there is the solution, but at least more variety would be great to see. 
While content will be filled in over time, and my issues there will be inevitably addressed in some way, the biggest question is how pacing will feel as the game is built. I think it currently feels a little slow. Frequently I find myself just wanting to play the actual combat situations but stuck in a chain of ""?"" events or stores that I can't afford anything at. Movement on the map is cute, but when I'm feeling especially impatient I find myself frustrated waiting for the next match or event to begin. There is currently a way to fast forward, which I was able to increase to 3x in the options, but that feels odd outside of combat. In menus and on the map I'd rather just tap space bar/A button to skip to the next scene or through dialogue. Stores and the ""?"" event spaces also feel too common. Maybe a single, unmissable store space right before each boss fight would feel better? ""?"" events currently feel too common for how few variety there are, there seems to only be a handful and I've seen them all a few times over by now—obviously this will probably feel different as more content is added.
It's a little hard to recommend at this point because it is, of course, a work in progress. If you're willing to take a bet on something uncertain, I think you could do a lot worse. It may just be a skeleton at this point, but it's a damn fine one. I don't feel too bad about the price of admission, though I did grab it on sale. Whether this game ends up being a fun distraction for a day or two, or, one of the truly great addicting puzzle games, is going to depend on the stuff we haven't seen yet. I think there's going to be a delicate balance to filling Peglin out with more content while not burying the aspects that make it great. Regardless, I'm looking forward to playing along as this one shapes up.",1672874479,1672874479,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Sad to say but right now it isn't worth the price.  
I have finished the game twice now, and still have time to refund it if I wanted.  $20 for under 2 hours of gameplay is not good value no matter what kind of game it is.  Right now this game is running on hype, which is the only reason I got it.

The graphics are pretty good for pixel art.  Yes the concept is a lot of fun, as getting that amazing shot is the kind of thing that got people addicted to peggle.   For right now though, there is little meat on the bone here. No story, no meta-progression, and a handful of levels.

In time that might change with early access, and if so I will redo my review here.  Like most early access all we have are promises, and I've been burned too many times to trust them.  So for right now I just can't recommend it for this price.",1650919098,1672795073,False,247,2,0.752840042114257813,28,True,False,True

I would like to see one of the devs play and see how they play act 1. You either need orobouros or a lucky relic combo before the act 1 boss. If you get the spider level to start, especially on cruciball 15+, you literally should just restart as you are losing about half your health at best.
New gold system is fine but needs work. Act 1, of course being 100x harder than the other acts, you are always desperate for gold and instantly spending every penny you get. If you don't happen to get 25 gold floor 1, then screw you you don't get an orb. They should look at successful games like slay the spire where you at least start with some gold. Or, level 1 orbs should be free, then upgrades cost money (like monster train). Then of course by act 3 you have so much gold you are desperately looking for ways to spend it, taking whichever path has the most shops. Again, look at slay the spire and monster train, with the guaranteed shop before the boss.

Peglin is a roguelite by way of Peggle and, thanks to Roundguard, is somehow not the first game I've played with this exact mashup of mechanisms. Just like in Peggle, the core idea is that you need to launch a ball each turn so it falls down a pachinko board and ideally hits as many pegs as possible. Peglin, though, uses those hits to decide how much damage you do to enemies that are advancing towards you. You win each level by defeating those levels and will almost always advance without even getting close to clearing the board. 

In theory, most of the fun in Peglin comes from skillfully aiming your shots to hit bombs, refresh orbs, and critical hit markers that boost your shot's damage. In practice, the outlandish behaviors of the more advanced orbs combined with the many relics you'll pick up over the game means that you don't really have much control over what happens after the first bounce. Many later maps have partially or fully hidden boards that make it even more impossible to predict what will happen, so success is realistically mostly about having enough buffs that your ball will bounce around for a while no matter what happens. 

Similarly, while the various enemies all theoretically have unique behaviors and attacks, in practice they all seem to be handled pretty well with that same strategy of just having your shots bounce around for as long as possible. Some situations are more or less favorable to bombs and crits, sure, but if your ball bounces around the board for a minute, it'll have hit plenty of both along the way. ",1672784971,1672784971,True,0,0,0.477707028388977051,0,True,False,True

The update that made you able to collect coins and purchase relics/orbs definitely made the game a lot better. The variation on orbs and relics allows quite a few different playstyles that adds replayability which is neat. 

There's not a lot of variations on the maps, so after a while it becomes very repetitive and you especially the early stages since you get to play them the most. There have been patches that adds new bosses and events, but it's still pretty light on content as it is right now. 

The cruciball challenges adds some more difficulty to the game, however it quickly becomes more of a hassle than fun. I noticed that I restarted quite often because the relics I got were not reliable enough to be able to get through the first stage, which made the first stage more of a chore than anything. Since the cruciball challenges stack, early cruciball challenges that felt fine to play through becomes very cumbersome later on. I like the idea of the cruciball challenges, but how it works right now it forces you to play more and more towards a specific playstyle and not try something different.

Far too RNG reliant with its physics that even trying to choose a path is left up to chance due to having to throw the ball into the hole associated with the path which half the time, you won't be able to due to bouncing off pegs in the way so you're forced to go the other path. You even get damaged if you go into the ones with fire which I feel is completely unnecessary post-fight.

I also see only two winning builds and that's it. Bomb focus and crit focus. Everything else, you are guaranteed to lose.

Maybe it will get a little better when they add meta-progression but the game needs some serious rebalancing either way.

I've noticed that a lot of the orbs are really underwhelming even in the base game, and that the amount of control you have over which orbs you can use makes it really hard to make things useful, since the ordering is random each time you reload your orbs.

At higher levels of difficulty, the game really starts to break down in an unfun way. Because of how random it is to obtain, use, and deal consistent damage with orbs, you really end up in a situation where you basically need to fish for runs in the first zone to even have a chance of clearing the first boss at all. By this point, almost all orbs are pretty bad, and there are only a few viable options to really choose from.

To make things at higher difficulties even more frustrating, enemy encounters are randomized, and not all of them are equivalently difficult. This applies to both elites and regular combat. Some normal combats simply have far more enemies to work through with no additional support from the board to deal with them. There are some elite counters which will simply be unbeatable on higher difficulties if you happen to run into them.

I think its a good game overall, but it needs a lot of polish and a balance pass that really tries to provide more synergy or support for less powerful builds and combos. I'm not convinced its worth the full asking price with how sparse it is on content, given its a fairly short game, but as they add more content the value for the game will go up.",1672339421,1672339421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It certainly lacks variety and depth and feels more like a game for your cellphone than PC. Let me explain. Apart from 4 to 3 Orbs the rest seems to be relativly useless compared, so you are basically stuck searching for the same three ""broken"" combos in every run. If you try a new combo or a new build it just don't gets the cut, because you always start with the same 5 orbs no matter how much you just unlocked. Progress just gets denied. If you dare to equip something other than 4 stones and a dagger, you will not progress any further. It only gets fun if you are extremly lucky and manage to collect perks/ traits like a cleptomanic hamster on crack and so it won't matters which orbs you have. Maybe add more content that gives the opportunity on making fun combos or more control in your runs. Why not add limits too your own loadout creator. so you dont have to start with the same stuff every time. 

As it is for the time its very frustrating to play because beside more ""challenging"" runs you seem to not progress to something, because you cant use your unlocks to progress... So you hope to get lucky instead of controlling your luck.

For those of you who haven't bought the game yet, I strongly suggest you wait for the full version and see how others react before deciding whether to buy the game. 

The normal mode of the game is not too difficult for most people, and even too monotonous to make it worth the price. However, the hard mode is just a nasty game that challenges patience and tests your luck. I doubt if the game creators have played the game's hard mode himself. 

Regarding the various imbalances in the game, other reviewers have already mentioned them, so I am not going to mention them again. 

Based on my playing hours and experience, I have reason to believe that the game creators made some unannounced ""adjustments"" in order to increase the difficulty level. Here are some of the possibilities:

- Starting around level 7 difficulty, the chance of the refresh peg being placed at the bottom or corner of the screen has increased significantly. This means that it is more difficult for players to refreshes all the pegs. 

- Starting around level 7, after defeating the final boss of the forest stage, there is a high chance that the relic given by the system will have side effects, and those side effects will cause a great deal of inconvenience to the player. For example, the relic that removes the only Refresh Peg or Critical Peg from the screen. This forces the player to give up a chance to get a relic. 

- Some useful relics have become very unlikely to appear, such as ""Gift That Keeps Giving"" and ""Kinetic Meteorite"".

In my experience the gold system is a positive part of the balance - it adds a lot of fun mechanics with regards to gold, and a trade-off decision making with healing / upgrading / drafting vs saving for a shop ahead.

The negatives as of 0.8.13:
- the crucible system does not feel very balanced, the difficulty step up is very noticeable with the bombs strength falling off, as the HP of act 1 mobs goes up. It is not uncommon for me to get stuck and lose a lot of hp on the early act 1 levels.
- surprise elites in ? is very punishing in act 1, the pathing gets so unpredictable when you encounter an elite on floor 2, and you have no tools to get out of this battle alive
- navigation between floors can really screw you over, and careful planning of the route can go out of the window with a single bad bounce. Min-maxing gold in the navigation also feels too risky, as of today.
- maybe it's the fault of my own, but I kinda figured out 2-3 viable orbs, and I stick to them in every run. Some orbs do not feel very viable / not balanced well, and that hurts discoverability of new strategies.",1672043917,1672043917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The infinitely replayable nature of this turn based Rouge-Like mean you can play it in the background while watching a new show, maybe some youtube, studying, taxes, housework. This is the game I default to when i need to do something but cant because i need my attention split

I've always been a huge fan of Peggle growing up and it was even the game i used to de-stress when coming out to my parents and this game perfectly captures the feeling while giving it its own flavouring, all of the Relics and Orbs you get will meld in some way to create a familiar and adaptable playstyle that's still unique from run-to-run and the game hasn't hit 1.0 yet! just when I think I've milked all I can, I get roped back in, the recently added shops and currency and now new orbs and relics that affect the currency and how you engage with it adds a new element of self imposed difficulty and advantage.

This is the most fair, fun and addictive version of plinko, with so many cool interactions between you and the enemies e.g. when the spiders hit you (not scary spiders) they make your pegs sticky slowing your ball down, some bosses work their way towards you slowly and affect you majorly when reaching you, putting a time limit on the battle and some will sit at the back sending minions at you and some will even walk up to you and start kicking your shit in and none of them feel unfair because the variety in orbs and relics and how they interact with your enemies allow you to utilise a mix between risk vs reward and genuine strategy.

If i could add anything to the game I'd say maybe cosmetics to further incentivise replayability and the only major need is more level variety, as of this version theres only 3 worlds which is a fine length, i feel like with how powerful the relics are but also the fact that some combos are objectively better means it would be hard to balance but maybe shuffling new worlds into the old mix would give more reason to go back, maybe a snow world where you do extra damage against the more fragile enemies but some of the pegs are made of ice and shatter when hit so you have to plan out how you're gonna tackle the problem rather than blindly shooting for the biggest cluster or refresh peg, It'd give the re-orbiniser and the bouldorb and a lot of the orbs i tend to avoid more utility outside of me having the specific relics or orbs to make them good, maybe the boss could be you breaking though some ice into the water below and a fish is coming up to swallow you and throwing pegs down you have to hit the boss with your orb but the damage still works the same so you're factoring in risk and luck whether you should shoot away from the boss to get more damage and hit it or shoot directly at it but at this point I'm just rambling.

I highly reccommend trying the game out!",1671797237,1671797237,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

What makes me not recommending this game is that is too random. When you get the option for new stuff, orbs and relics, it is out of a completely random selection. At higher difficulties, unless you get exactly the right stuff, it is impossible to beat the game. Part of the problem is that a lot of orbs and relics are trash. When, for instance, you beat the forest boss the choice of high tier relics could just be a platter of trash and you rather skip than taking any of them. Part of the problem here is that some relics have negative side effect, for example you get a damage bonus but you can only aim in four directions. I guess the game is still in devlopment and there is a lot more to do before 1.0 release. The introduction of the store is a great idea, but maybe more choices would be a thing? Or at least you could start the game with the orb of your choice? Rather than a bunch of junk stones that you are going to pay to get rid of as soon a possible? Another problem is that there are too few possibilities to heal, you have to go into a fight to pay to heal, which sometimes comes out to you wasting more HP in the fight than you can heal.

I've had a fun time with Peglin so far. Having spent 30+ hours on it in the first week of playing I can't give it other than a positive recommendation. The game would be helped with some additional content and it would be nice if the balance was improved to unlock more successful strategies for building your orb-bag. This is to be expected of an early access game of course and overall, I'd say the game is already worth the price as is.

-----------------------------------------
Edit: I wanted to add this edit now that the game has been developed a few months more. I'm disappointed with what they have done, they have added stuff, but after putting the game aside for a couple of months and returning to it I find that my enjoyment of the game has regressed.

I liked playing this game not because it was a difficult game, but because of the occasional crazy combo's you could pull off. They have added content, but that content does not offer new fun ways to win the game. Instead it has made the runs more vanilla, every run seems to be the same.

1. There are too many vanilla orbs and relics that are offered, which has made it impossible to build a good strategy, because there's just too much 'stuff'
2. Of the strategies that are available, several are not valid. Especially the high risk-reward strategy of using orbs that self-damage is hopeless, because there's simply not enough sustain in the game to compensate for the self-damage that you do.

I usually wouldn't be to bothered by balance in a early access review, but in this case I have changed my recommendation since the balance regression has really taken away from the core of what makes the game fun.",1659559870,1671367064,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

And how it reimagines the gameplay into hitting as many coin pegs as you can as opposed to killing all the enemies. 

I would rather spend a bunch of time working hard on a single level, and maybe failing it. Kind of like a puzzle. Instead of clearing out a whole bunch of levels really fast. I also found something to be desired with the level designs.  I like the first level that shows up, with the curvy bits. Or a lot of the levels with curvy bits in general. I tended not to enjoy the levels that are designed after a shape, or a drawing, I prefer levels that are designed around ball physics and navigating the ball. I also find that the resolution of the spheres wasn't high enough, there weren't enough angles. Like I found the ball and the pegs to be jagged in terms of their collision. In Peggle, the pegs feel more spherical and I feel that adds to the replay value because there are so many different ways to bounce a ball.

Though this game is unfinished the concept here just works to the point I can't belive peggle didn't come up with it. Its kind of like how Lego should have invented Minecraft haha anyway the point is this is a great slay the spire version of peggle that is just relaxing fun. 

What I love personally is the potential this game has when they add more characters beyond the little goblin you can only play with currently. I love the feeling of a little adventurer with a bag of stones fighting his way though castles and dungeons etc. The variety of orbs/stones is great and feels intuitive its fun to create your own broken builds that smash all the pegs in a way that does mega damage to the enemies. 

I recomend this game for all ages and all gamers of different skill levels.

All of these playstyles feel rewarding, and the others more imaginative people might be able to bring together undoubtedly will too.

So this game is a rogue-lite peggle-style combat game where your weapons are the ""orbs"" you throw into the ""pachinko"" machine, and you go up against a random selection of monsters and bosses (though the stages themselves seem pretty much hard coded) via a ""tree diagram"" style navigation.  

There's a few recent changes that make a big difference in how the game plays, and some of that is for the better and some for the worse.  Overall, the only real strategy you can take with this game is choosing relics and orbs to use.  There's a bit of strategy with the navigation too but you can easily find your ball bounce off an orb or a bomb and fly all the way to the other side of the playfield to send you down the path you DIDN'T want to go.

Also, this game moves painfully slow, so if you're the kind of person who likes to watch with bated breath while biting your nails hoping the ball won't fly into the fire at the end navigation screen or whatever, this is your game.  Fortunately there's an option to speed things up, even going farther than I would personally go... 1.5x, 2x, and 3x.  I feel like 2x is the speed the game SHOULD move at, but it's still just a teensy bit too fast in some cases (1.75x?)  but that's personal preference.

It's still Early Access so this could all change.  They've promised different classes and they've made significant changes to the game already, so I may have to update this review again later.  Originally when I started trying to play this game, it was so annoying that I barely could get past the first boss without some kind of really lucky run.  In fact it was mostly the slime boss that gave me trouble because of the peg layout.  Then I managed a REALLY lucky run and made it all the way to the last boss on the third stage (yeah only three stages) and got it to within single digit hitpoints before it ended the game on me.

Honestly, there's still a lot of RNG in this game, and that's kinda frustrating, especially when you know where you want to aim your ball and the game decides ""nah, it's gonna bounce back the way it came and hit the opposite side instead"".  There's also some relics that seem like a good deal if you don't read the fine print and then you find out that you actually screwed yourself over.  

Basically though, if you pick the right relics and decide on a proper strategy (mostly revolving around number of balls in your satchel) you CAN win the game probably 60% of the time...maybe.  After you win they just try to make the game harder by weakening you, but at least being able to buy balls/relics you can take a bit more control over the outcome.

One of the major changes since the game was released was the addition of currency.  Now you have to buy your new orbs, orb improvements, or health between levels, and they also added a shop in case you decided to stockpile your cash and ignore everything along the way.  I am NOT a fan of the shops.  Most of the time I have less than 25Gold (which is the minimum price for orbs) and so I wind up wasting a navigation spot without getting ANYTHING out of it.  

So basically, there's 5 kinds of rooms you can enter: an enemy room (skull and cross bones), a TOUGH enemy room (Red Skull and Cross bones), a random event room (marked by a question mark), a Treasure room (Marked by a chest), and now a Gold shop (Marked by a G in a circle).   You choose where to go by shooting your ball toward the icon at the bottom of the screen, and god help you if there are pegs in your way.

Weak enemy rooms give you a chance to earn more gold by hitting pegs with a yellow dot in it, strong enemy rooms give you the chance to pick an extra relic, question mark rooms give you any of the other rooms or some special event, Treasure rooms give you a choice of relics, and gold shop gives you the chance to buy a large number of balls or relics as long as you have gold to pay for it.   Oh and there's some secret treasure chests if you destroy all the bombs in the between navigation screen.  Hard to do without a combination of other relics but nice when it works.

It also seems like every stage has at least two bosses so there's a bit of replay value left there.  Other than that this is a pretty casual game, and it also works great on the steam deck (most of the time).  In fact Steam Deck is where most of my recent playtime has come from.  I don't really enjoy playing it at the computer as much.  

The part where this goes from a bad review to good is in knowing what to skip.  Pick the wrong relic and the game is ruined.  You might as well quit and start over.  Skip the relic altogether and maybe you'll get something decent later on?  Hopefully skipping the relic won't hurt you.  Likewise, once you know how some relics work, you might want to avoid buying new orbs.  I found there's some relics that increase your stats every reload, but if you have a ton of orbs in your satchel, you may only get to reload once in battle before it's over and that's not much of a benefit.

Really this isn't a full thumbs up.  It would be a meh thumb if it existed, but that's better than the thumbs down it used to be.  Right now the cons are: RNG, only 3 stages vs mild strategy and casual gameplay for the pros.  (Casual gameplay would be a con if you're looking for something more serious, but then the RNG would be a turnoff there too).   So my advice is to buy it on sale or follow the game to see when it gets more updates so that there's more content.  It's a 6/10 game at the moment, but hopefully it'll get better before it leaves early access.",1653610289,1670779074,True,0,0,0.537811040878295898,3,True,False,True

One example is the ""wall"" boss board on the second map, where the top pegs are unbreakable and block lines of sights. Don't get me wrong, this game involves mostly a lot of luck as with most rougelikes, but dying because you have no pegs left to hit and an unreachable refresh peg feels unfair and frustrating since it destroys the most bare mechanic of the game.

I rarely feel like I died due to my own mistakes, and even when I do it's because I chose an item that seems at first to be useful but ends up completely ruining my build, because a ton of items seem interesting, such as limiting the directions you can aim, but in practice they just make things less interesting and ruin your run.

Enemy mechanics in some cases are fun and interesting, like the shield guys in the castle, but a lot of them, especially bosses, just seem designed to require pure luck to get past. The Minesweeper style boss in the caves looked really cool at first but then I realized that the way the pegs are structured is impossible to get a good set of bounces off on to maximize damage to take out the whopping 6500 frigging health points it has when it is constantly spewing out more enemies and is dealing increasing amounts of damage to me over time. Even if I got 500 damage a turn, (without overflow or piercing), he feels like he'd still kill me from full HP, and 500 damage a turn is something I've only consistently averaged with god-builds from runs that didn't screw me over.

Now that we have a lot of Cruciball and an economy, I feel the need to update this review.

The game is still chaotic. I struggle to say it's a particularly strategic game. It's not Slay the Spire where you really dig down into how to build a deck and deviate interesting directions based on what you get methodically. That being said, it's got it's own appeal to it as a passive game and what they did add addressed a lot. Boss variety and enemies variety over time has been made to account for throwing a wrench in strategies, as well as Cruciball modifiers changing up what you do. The money aspect especially adds a lot if not strategy than at least decisions. Now you don't just cross your fingers after battle hoping you get an upgrade instead of a new orb, removing orbs is no longer exclusive to ""?"" events, and now you don't just 90% of the time chuck the ball directly into a direction to end a level. I always found the end navigation by way of peggle cute, but pointless because it was very rare you'd risk ending up in the wrong well. Now you get to go for coins. Now you don't necessarily just finished a battle off in 1 shot, you find time to go for coins. 

It's getting significantly better and I fully recommend it now. I just have my fingers crossed multiple characters turns out just as good, but am also hesitant they might go the easy route and just make minor starting item differences rather than Slay the Spire style where each character has access to vastly different cards.",1650929460,1670541933,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,True

The physics make no sense, you can never tell if a bounce will launch a ball across the entire stage or if it will make it lose all momentum and start falling straight down till it is out of the map. What balls do is too over complicated for the random gameplay. Dropping a ball on the side of the stage to choose a map direction is pointless and doesn't add to the fun, it just gives you an opportunity to fuck up your idea of where you want to go. Coins were a pointless over complicated addition from previous versions. 

When you launch a ball you cannot predict what will happen past the first bounce, yet you have to do well or else your run will soon be restarting and everything you built up is lost, destroying the excitement of building up in future runs

The game should have gone with an escalating difficulty levels system of progression like angry birds or.... peggle...., not roguelike.

Was not disappointed! It's basically a Peggle rogue-like, but definitely has it's own identity!

General gameplay loop is interesting and the peg layouts feel quite rewarding! Lots of cool peg-related mechanics and balls make for interesting choices, especially the addition of ""crit"" pegs that rearrange each shot!

The designer(s) definitely know how to make this kind of game fun and understand the potential of a rogue-like pinball-esque game.

Also, I always play the game on 2x speed - great feature. I recommend using it after 5 or so runs.

Once you get a run going it´s a bit limiting still, but then there are enough synergies and different map and enemy modifiers that the game can be fun.

But everything before that is way too slow, way too rng, and way too tedious and boring. 
You start with 3 stones and no clear way to get rid of them, if at all it will be long after the difficulty starts ramping, there barely starts to be a synergy between the different orbs you pick until way too late in the game. Infact, the different orbs barely have any synergies anyways, yes they change the board a bit...but it´s not like that is much of a strategy. Right? I only barely can choose the orb that I need for the situation and then the next, that´s not strategy for me. What gets hit is way too rng to stack effects as well. So I just end up with a bunch of random orbs that leave so much stuff that I am bound to hit some random stuff eventually, but that is bruteforcing, not strategic thinking about crosseffects or specific setups against the next encounter. And there is not much game left anyways, it´s 3 maps and you need until the end of the second to get something resembling a ""strategy"" going (hurrdurr I go multiorb, bombs and healorb). So the unfun parts get drawn out over and over again and the fun part ends in basically oneshots for 1 map. It´s positive vs negative difficulty and as of now this game chooses wrong: It makes you weak with no way of having much gameplay impact because the options you have are so limiting and later on you are so strong that you basically oneshot half of  the fights. Meanwhile difficulty should mean that the maps/fields/orbs are giving you so many options for meaningful plays WHILE the enemies are a meaningful challenge that YOU get to outplay them. And the challenge should rise with the playerpower.

And the playing fields, I appreciate the modifiers on them (black holes/mirror effects) but those only start ramping in the endgame too. For most of your early fights you have super boring fields where you waste whole turns just to RNG your way to hit a reset. And starting with 3 stones and one crit orb multiplies the boredom of basically having to clear fields, when neither the board nor the orbs you have do anything interesting. So you are either reliant on rng giving you a map where hitting the reset is viable to ramp up damage, or where you are reliant on the crit multiplier to be in a useable spot to hit exactly one enemy. Half of your shots are completely wasted just trying to get to either of them or them spawning at a completely unusable spot on the field. 

It´s not even about difficulty at this point with the negative dmg modifiers for your stones in the beginning. It´s about how long it takes to create a playable field, the beginning phase is way too long, too tedious, too boring, to rng heavy to be fun. The game needs to ramp up way quicker, give more customizability from the start, stones should be at best a decision that you wanna play with them (maybe they become stronger the more you have, maybe give better multiplier trinkets whatever) and not a way to limit early game power with boredom because of how little versatility they have in their useage.

Also shops are beyond pointless. I can already buy orbs after fights, I get trinkets from bosses and random chests, I can upgrade only with money or encounters...so shops are only good for getting rid of orbs, ONCE PER SHOP. So the game asks me to save up money, aka do not buy more interesting orbs, so that I can have a chance of getting rid of ONE stone at a shop...it honestly should be the other way around. After a fight you get to lose something boring to make the game more interesting BECAUSE you chose to engage with it and THEN the shops should provide you with ways of stacking synergies, not just another extra orb that might or might not even come to any meaningful use in the next fights.

In summary: Instead of making me weak and plain, make the challenges more interesting and the maps ramping up faster. Don´t create difficulty by simply nerfing me to make me more weak and plain boring, but buff enemies and have more stuff going on. Give me more options to save a throw so there is more strategy aspects at play, never ever should there be a point in the game where something like: Throw orb *dink 3 dmg Throw orb *dink 17 dmg, throw orb *dink 4 dmg throw orb *endless stuff happening that goes way beyond the enemies health-threshold and getting nothing for it. Every throw should be meaningfully contributing and the player should always be challenged to use a strategic value for every throw instead of treading rng hell.",1669830370,1669934657,False,31,1,0.588232874870300293,0,True,False,True

Shop helps the randomocity be a little lesser, and actually allows you to get builds. There's still just a sheer amount of orbs in the game that you can STILL go many entire games without seeing an orb. It's a lot harder to than before, so it's a step in the right direction. It's an improvement. 

Peg bounciness feels like it was cranked to 11 with a complete disregard for any type of physics. Have shot my ball in the exact same spot multiple times, and received different results despite the board having no changes. Not sure what they did behind the scenes, but it's incredible how differently the orbs are acting after this update.  

Still can't recommend in good faith. Cruciball is super hard, but they said it was because they're still working on it, so we'll let that pass. But yeah, still think you should wait on this. 

Editing For Balance Pass on 9-28: 

Lots of changes happened, trying to make some orbs better and some builds more fun. I think this pass was definitely a step in the right direction, but ultimately not enough for specifically the shielded enemies. It's just insane to me that we offer bombs on a map for shielded enemies but the bombs, even if you multi-orb and hit every single one of them, only take the shield down to about 1/3 health, and you still have to crush through it while enemies are slinging arrows and magic and healing. I know what you're probably thinking ""What about piercing damage, bouldorb or worbhammer?"" I had worbhammer, couldn't get to the singular refresh though to make it do more than about 40 damage. Was never offered a bouldorb or icircle. Hopefully when they start releasing classes or addressing the sheer volume of orbs in the game this improves. For now, still gotta leave it at a thumbs down because we're still in supremely unfun territory in the cruciball. There's no difficulty factor, it's just plain unfair enemies that the board doesn't offer enough variety on to allow you to take them out.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you play just the base game or do custom runs you’ll be able to find some quirky builds and have a bit of fun. If you want anything more out of this game, like playing through the cruciball then you’re going to have a bad time. 

The physics engine for how pegs bounce has always been a pile of hot garbage. Lately it seems worse than ever, but maybe that’s just the advent of shields in the second area. Certain relics that cause pegs to act differently are the most inconsistent thing. Electro peg net and it’s orb come to mind for how wonky they are. In prior updates it was fun wonk with some frustration, but lately it feels like the peg net is designed to force your ball into the wall or down to the bouncers. Which is weird because those aren’t pegs. 

The cruciball itself and its added challenge aren’t horrible, giving some good difficulty.  The problem comes from how inconsistent everything is. Builds feel like they get nerfed every single update so that one shots are only possible if you get exact perfect luck. As if battles are trying to be drawn out into long slugfests. 

Orb variety is starting to get a little bit insane in that you might not see a specific orb type the entire game. I just finished one where multiorb didn’t exist until the spot before the act3 boss. I had a build where multiorb would’ve been insanely strong. But it just didn’t exist. Sure, that’s part of the randomness of a rogue like. But when I get offered a swoltorb and every other battle it just feels like something isn’t quite right.

I’m hoping future updates will change things",1664236094,1669932324,False,4,1,0.532809972763061523,0,True,False,True

However, there are a few issues with the game that are causing me to not want to play it in its current state.

1. Balancing - So many of the orbs are straight up bad. They seem to mostly just have a random grab bag of effects and it doesn't feel like you can really make a cohesive ""theme"". If you do, they are usually pretty bad anyway. One in particular is ""self-damage"". While there are tons of orbs and artifacts which inflict self-damage, there is very little healing in the game. There's just 3 healing orbs, two of which are usable once per battle, and one of them which deals increasing self-damage every time it is used. And it's possible that they won't even be offered during your run at all. You can heal yourself once after every battle, but it is expensive (costs as much as upgrading or buying an orb) and you only heal for 20%. 

Disregarding the self-damage, healing in general is very weak and feels somewhat frustrating. In most battles, taking damage is completely unavoidable. You often suffer a slow attrition of HP throughout the stage, get to the boss, then get instakilled from a large hit. It feels bad to lose this way. Not even STS is this stingy with healing effects.

2. Currency - I did like the update that introduced coins. It gives us something to farm during the battles and we get to choose whether we want to end the battle quickly, or farm. However, it could still use some tweaking. I'm finding that I NEVER have any coins saved up for the merchant, as I am always using them on upgrading/adding orbs, or healing (which always feels bad to have to do). I would prefer upgrading/adding orbs to be free like they were previously, but being able to use the coins at the merchant. Right now, there's no reason you would really want to save for the merchant, so it feels like a useless stop. Adding/upgrading orbs and healing is just too important.

3. Level design - Maybe this is just me, but I feel like a good amount of stages have very awkward design, which don't allow very much bouncing. As a result, many stages just feel frustrating to play. When you play a pachinko/brick breaker-style game, you really expect to see that satisfying bounce.

4. Path selection - This is the BIGGEST one for me. I absolutely hate the path choosing system. This alone is the reason I give up runs and stop playing more than anything else. For those who don't know, at the end of each fight/event, you have to shoot your ball through the pachinko again and whichever side it lands on is the path you take. It feels SO bad to carefully choose your path, only for you to encounter some unavoidable obstacle or random bounce that changes your path completely. I can't even tell you the amount of times I have rage quit after being denied a path with a treasure chest or 2 to a random bounce making me go in the complete wrong direction. It is the most anti-fun part of the game and is the main reason I only have only 14 hours on this game despite buying it back in August. I know it seems trivial, but I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.

All that being said, the game has entertained me, and I did have fun playing it. I believe that it has the potential to be great, so I will still give a thumbs up in hopes that the devs will take the feedback to heart and release an awesome final product.",1669682313,1669682313,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

I have seen a few reviews saying that this game is too short to justify the price, and although I can understand that; I overall think that this game holds long term value because the gameplay loop is enjoyable. Considering this game is still in active development and I can see that the developer is receptive and ready to tackle any issues, the future of this game seems very bright. I must admit, after a few runs you will feel like you have seen most of the game, but I think this is just because of how this game is still being developed. In my opinion, this game is great for ending a tough or long day and want something to play while you watch a show or video and want to keep your mind on instead of turning it completely off for the day. If you want something to dive super deep into like you can with slay the spire or the like; Peglin is not there yet, but I believe that with the things that are planned to be launched will bring a larger variety to the gameplay and replayability.

If you liked peggle and like roguelikes, this game is a must-buy.

For everyone else, I'd say it's still worth the purchase. The game is fun and the developers are active, continuing to add new content and balancing the existing stuff. They've done quite a good job so far, in my opinion. The game's difficulty scaling is customizable to the point where you can make the game tough but fair.

Prices have been fixed, you now get more items/upgrades than before and I dont aim for currency at all. It's really not nearly as bad as people are saying. Runs have way more control than before and you're picking more orbs/upgrades per game. 

After some updates this game has gotten incredible, and I know a few things that are planned and will greatly improve the game IE peglin classes for more build variety.

The amount of builds in this is crazy. This game is a GREAT mix of puzzle game and roguelike.

Before, most of the builds you could ""build"" was basically just get a couple of good orbs and some good relics and you'll just stomp.

Now, you have a bit more control over your run, more artifacts add more interactions. I think practically every single tiny artifact has some synergy somewhere. If it's something more than ""+1 damage on non crits"" you're going to find synergy somewhere, plus +damage is never bad. 

A great example of a synergy I accidentally came across was the bully orb (+1/+2 damage per self inflicted damage), I had a few orbs that did like 2-5 damage to myself when I shoot them so I thought that was the only source I could buff it from.
I didnt really get any insane use out of it but eventually I came across an artifact choice after a mini boss, the only good item for my build was x2 damage but take 3 damage every 15 pegs you hit in combat. Bully orb completely not on my mind because the x2 damage was incredible elsewhere. Then I got to the next mini boss and pulled the bully orb LAST in my first round and it was doing something like 23-36 damage per peg, which is ABSOLUTELY insane, for reference, the rocks you start with do 3-5, aka 3 damage per peg on a normal hit and 5 per peg on a crit. 36 damage per peg is bonkers.

This game is crazy. The music is great. Castle boss fight is literally crash bandicoot theme song x dueling banjos and it gets stuck in my head every time I play this game.",1650981842,1669479780,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,True

Peglin is full of roguelike elements and each run will be different from the last, while giving you as the player plenty of control over how your game plays out. You are given choices for adding new balls to your roster or upgrading ones you already own. The game is challenging and rewarding, also it's quite appealing visually and the sound design is satisfying.

If you've watched the trailer and seem even somewhat interested in what Peglin is trying to accomplish, then you won't regret buying it and trying it because it's a well polished game that will keep you entertained.

At times everyone needs some simple game for a relatively relaxing experience. Sure, Peglin is still a Roguelite, in the same vein as FTL and Slay the Spire, but the idea of slowly progressing and doing that little bit better (or worse) each time has some calming effect.

Much like many Roguelites it does seem to have some balancing issues, adding content semi-frequently. Quantity over quality seems to be the case.

I am 36.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

They're pretty plentiful and all over the board. getting them isn't hard, and it just means you're hitting more pegs honestly. You use the coins to heal, purchase new orbs, and upgrade orbs, which, you can both purchase and upgrade multiple times in one ending screen.

I guess it makes it a bit of a detriment if you're trying a super specific type of build that requires precision...but all my builds I usually end up just trying to hit everything, everywhere, all at once. so to me, it is a great boon. I guess others hate the coin addition. it just made it a bit closer to slay the spire.

Really the change that I would make to the coin system, make the first choice you do at the end of the level a free choice, and everything after that would end up costing the coins you've been gathering.

The gameplay is an enjoyable blend of skill and luck, with everything down to the movement being designed around the core gameplay. I love games that attempt to use their charming aspect as much as they can and Peglins does this wonderfully. I hope to see more updates coming in the future as the game does lack balancing. Before the coins update it was sometimes hard to win unless you went for an optimal strategy every time. However now I played a run to have fun with some of the new relics and it was really easy to win. This is because of the abundance of coins in the mid game meaning i could buy and fully upgrade an orb in 1 encounter. This made it too easy as the lack of random shitty orbs in your inventory is now gone. Plus there are still balancing issues from previos relics and orbs like the cookie makes health a construct that doesnt effect you if you dont want it to. These things can be shifted and worked on over time, with either the encounters getting a difficulty bump, or a nerf of the powerful relics.

Edit: Editing for the steam awards. They've continued to update and they added coins so now instead of pure upgrades you have to have gold to do anything.

Well, I played it for about an hour, and beat it on the very first run. This game doesn't really offer any challenge to overcome. You become incredibly strong pretty quick. I got a total of 5 or so orbs in my ""deck"" and was dealing 1-4k damage every hit.

Basically grabbed everything related to bombs.

They did add some ""New Game +"" mode, but it's very much just ""make the game harder."" Which it should of been already.

Currently refunding the game as it is really fun, but currently lacks heavily in content and can be nearly explored in one 60m run. Would love to have most relics and balls locked behind achievements and to see stuff locked behind the cruciball modes. At least make it so I feel like there's progression and rewards for completing things.

You already have everything unlocked to begin with, so removing that stuff NOW will just upset people. Classes are coming, which can be a reward after completions, but PERSONALLY, that isn't enough to pull my attention.

To kinda TLDR this thing;
The game is pretty easy and everything seems to be unlocked from the start. It's great for a quick experience as I got, but doesn't seem to give any challenges beyond completing your first run. Give it a play because the concept is amazing and satisfying, but you'll also probably be able to refund after you beat it <3",1669191360,1669191360,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you like Roguelites and peggle/pachinko this will be right up your alley. 

You fight enemies in a turn based style and you use a variety of orbs which you collect and add to your deck on your run to hit pegs on a board which builds your damage. As you progress you receive relics which buff you in some way to aid you in making builds. 

Like other games in the genre, there is an element of rng at play, but dont let other reviews fool you into thinking that the rng dictates your run. If you have played games like Isaac, Gungeon etc we all know that these elements are the core of games like this. Peglin is no different. The way that you play, the items, balls and upgrades you choose all affect your run. There are a tonne of bonkers synergies and the game gives you plenty of choices throughout to give you opportunities to succeed. I would argue that there are only a couple of balls or relics that are somewhat lacklustre, everything else gives you a solid set up. 

The game as it stands currently is somewhat limited in regards to general progression. All of the items are unlocked to begin with so there's not as much sense of achievement as there are in similar games where you unlock more as you progress. I imagine this will change with time. Currently for beating the game, you unlock something called the ""Cruciball"" these are additional difficulty settings that stack as you win on each level of it. The game gets quite hard with these enabled overall but it's still manageable. Overall the game itself on the default difficulty is light, fun and easy. You can also drop the game at any point and pick up your run any time. 

Overall, the game is really solid and will be a stand out within the genre of roguelikes given it keeps receiving the consistent updates and content that it has been. It's really fun and the devs are constantly working on it as of this moment. I boot up the game every couple of weeks to see what's been added which keeps me coming back (Given I've beaten all of the cruciball levels)

I like the game, a neat little peggle roguelike, very simplistic in what it does, and is basically exactly what it is trying to be. While I like the game, I feel at a $20+ price tag, I'd expect a *lot* more out of the game. 

As it is you have 3 levels with 3 bosses, only a handful of maps, and maybe a couple dozen artefacts and orbs to use. You can basically beat the game and effectively interact with 90% of the events and boards within your first run. Which now brings me to variety, as there are only maybe 2 or 3 practical builds to use to make any significant progress in a run, everything else you build is ultimately just a meme that won't even beat a few slimes. 

I understand this is an early access game, but with such a short game, no story, limited items, and no unlocks, it's weird that it would be released even as early access, especially at the price it is. Maybe a few months down the line they will have more content, and I'd say then it would be worth it, as is, I feel like unless you are very easily entertained at repeat tasks, the game is maybe only an hour of content for you if even that. 

I like the game for what it is, as it does what it intends to do well, but it is very limited in content, so I recommend it with the caveat I don't actually recommend you get it until it has more content.

It certainly needs to be balanced out a bit better and maybe have differing costs per ball, scaling cost of healing, artifacts and balls that synergize with money in some way- but it's an update in the right direction.

It still suffers from feature bloat and a bit of balance issues (the overwhelming majority of balls and artifacts are shit, and the one that remain break the game), but the devs are changing how the game works while listening to feedback and I trust the game will only improve over time.

I personally like it and would recommend, but for the majority of players, I won't recommend it, being in the current state at the current price point. Wait for sale if the screenshots didn't excite you.",1669138439,1669138439,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I was on the fence whether or not to recommend this game for a while, but with the most recent update, it is a clear thumbs up! Now with the addition of gold and shops you can better shape your build by purchasing and removing specific orbs from your arsenal. Looking for a specific build after getting a lucky relic early on? Well now you can save up gold, find those perfect orbs, and immediately upgrade it all the way with the saved up money. 

I couldn't tell you how many runs had great potential before the update but were dragged down by having the starting stones in my deck. Now I'm not afraid of having inconsistent DPS at the end of the game because I can route to shops when needed. 

New levels of Cruciball have also been added that give more of a challenge to experienced Peglin players. Very happy I withheld my review until the game was further developed.

Check how many times one even passes to stage 2 on difficulty 7, let alone stage 3. Unreasonable stage 1 regular enemy much stronger than elites, unreasonable trash marbles, totally negative events, and many more very frustrating enemies you know you are totally screwed upon seeing... I understand this is pre-release, but seriously, dev, before you even release a small update, play your game once, just once is enough. Still like the game, but making it challenging isn't equal to fk up the players.

Update after a recent major update: 
After enough hrs of the gameplay, I think it's fair to say the devs definitely don't have a labour to play their game at all. I can give a few suggestions based on their game logic: 
1. The forest slime boss in the cruciball, it's better to give it instead of 900 HP, let it be 9000, and it's even better to delete the refresh peg given that often you can't hit it anyways. Intuitively, since the mucus resembles a shield, give this boss a defence that equals the mucus peg count as well. For the players to win, give it a slime core that deals 100% true dmg. Certainly this core is surrounded by layers of mucus and always drifts to the opposite side, but at least it's winnable so stop being a wuss.
2. The inverted elite, HP=9116 seems fair, and definitely the blackholes are too few while the pegs are too many. It's even better that only one refresh peg is allowed and be tightly surrounded by 4 blackholes so the player always smiles while trying to hit it. Redesign the config so the player can hit max 5 pegs each time with a 3-sigma confidence level. Certainly it's the players fault if they don't find enough bramballs to stop it.
2.5. Shield wizard needs some real magic: to numb/freeze/shock/blind the peglin so he has enough time to shield multiple layers on all the pegs. Can't one hit him? The weak shouldn't fight then.
3. The final crystal goblin boss, what's its name again? I suggest it only gives players 3 pegs to hit: refresh, crit and red bomb. Better yet, upon hit once, the red bomb disappears forever and good luck to find the cheese and round guard with one marble at hand on the way there.
4. This game is not challenging enough, please introduce an inflation system that never cuts short. It's too mild now. Also, who tells this green creature to avoid tax? A 20% VAT looks legit. Heal system is way too friendly as well, since ideally once injured, our cute peglin is weakened instead of strengthened, unless equipped with relics, of course.
5. Boss relic is full of strong ones and is not compulsory as some negative events are. Negative events are not enough either. A genius idea combines the two as sort of a synergy: A compulsory relic after forest/castle guarantees only negative events encounters, and all route choice is a forced RNG, so in the end this despicable peglin ends up with a full hand of terriballs and barely any HP before the next boss fight.

However, it currently has mixed reviews as of November 18th because a large update just fundamentally changed the secondary gameplay loop. As expected, some people are resistant to change, but I genuinely believe it was a good update that many of those people will come around to once they're used to how things work now.

So what was this divisive update? Goblin capitalism, that's what. Numerous pegs on each combat board now contain a little coin that will gratifyingly *ping* when popped. Previously, after combat, you were randomly given the option to pick one of three random orbs, or the option to upgrade an existing orb (or in either one you could opt to heal instead). Now you're presented all three options after every combat, but you need to pay gold for each service you use. Haglin has also set up his shop finally, offering orbs, relics, and a removal service for some gold as well.

You're no longer at the complete mercy of RNG to upgrade your orbs. You now see more orbs in the post-battle rewards per run since they always appear. You can buy an orb after battle and then instantly upgrade it to max level if you have the gold for it, where previously it would take at least two combats (and RNG to get two upgrades in a row) before maxing your new toy. And possibly the biggest upside of this is that your post-battle rewards never feel wasted. If you're on max HP and don't want any orb you're offered, then you just save your gold so you might be able to grab two orbs in the future, or an upgrade + a heal, or get to Haglin and get him to remove one of your useless basic stones. The game is now far more flexible and makes your between fight decision-making more meaningful, while retaining the gambling-esque nature of the roguelike genre.",1669073382,1669073382,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Updates have been a bit slow, but they released the shop and currency update just recently. It took me a bit to get used to the new mechanics (I played about 50 hours without them), but now I enjoy them.

Buying orbs gives a bit more control to the player. Before the update you had to hope for good RNG, which was frustrating if the orbs did not fit your build. That being said, the currency system is not without flaws either. If you are missing 1 gold to get the orb you want, it feels frustrating, too.

A real step in the right direction. Some more content would be nice, but I'm glad that a major issue has been addressed. Changing to recommended for now.

EDIT: Speed up options are a good start , and some rubbish encounters have been cleaned up a bit. However, there is now a new wave of relics which hint at mechanics that the game just doesn't deliver on (or need). For example, Muscircle and Spinesse, which increase damage by +X to either crit or damage, already exist on other items - These new relics provide nothing unless you manage to fulfil requirements that the game still doesn't really let you meet. Upgrading and getting new orbs is still complete random, and you still get runs where you get nothing but one or the other. A lot of new orbs seem to the same thing existing orbs do. A step in the right direction, but still needs a lot of polish. Cruciball still sucks, stop filling my inventory with crap instead of trying to come up with a real challenge.

A great idea trapped in a web of poor design and frustrating encounters. 

I love that the game lets you go for utterly daft builds. That's great, more rogue-likes need to let you have absolutely ridiculous runs. Nothing beats throwing a multi-orb with the multi-orb item and having 10 orbs flying around. Throwing hundreds of bombs in one turn is hilarious. Relics are nice and varied, with only a few being absolutely pointless. Good variety of orbs, but currently the game seems to be balanced around anything piercing - If you don't have any of them by act 2, or at least a consistent way of hitting bombs, you're probably out. I can see this game being great fun with a LOT of work. 

Onto the bad - Everything takes far too long, enemies have to move one at a time, attack one at a time, projectiles move one at a time. It's not like you can react to any damage coming your way, so why not have it all just happen at once? Certain encounters (anything involving spiders) are so miserably slow that i often just restart if i encounter them in the forest.

The Forest is the weakest part of the game - Almost every encounter is designed in such a way that there's not really any clear or optimal way to deal damage, or simply takes far too long. You just have to throw and hope your orb goes the way you expect. Many of the Forest encounters seem like you're expected to hit bombs to deal any damage, which means you're going to be throwing a lot of turns randomly hoping that you go the right direction.

There are two good bosses in the game - [spoiler]The Mole and The Ballista are fun. The same cannot be said for any other boss. The Slime is just miserable - Better than it was in the demo, but still a complete slog. The Wall is just a DPS check. The Ruins boss can be beaten simply by throwing every orb to the left while the bottom left segment is rising (give it a try, it's basically guaranteed). On a similar note, the invisible mini-boss is quite simply idiotic. You can't possibly plan shots. If you take a certain combination of items, your turns can go for literally tens of minutes.[/spoiler]

Playing the game in its current state is mostly a constant series of asking yourself the same frustrating questions.

Why do the majority of boss reward items simply defeat the purpose of the game? Why line up a shot when the RNG magnet decides your fate? Why aim when Multi-ball will send orbs flying everywhere? Why would i ever take anything that isn't The Gift That Keeps Giving? 

Why is upgrading orbs random? Why does the game seem to love events that just give you stones? Why does the refresh orb sometimes just spawn somewhere where you have to waste turn upon turn reaching it? Why even have sloped surfaces if the pegs disappear before you have any chance to roll down?

In conclusion, currently, No, I wouldn't recommend this game. It needs a lot of polish, and could be great, but as an early access title, it just isn't worth delving into the frustrating mess that the game currently is.

People criticizing the coin update saying its more content bloating don't actually understand how it mechanically functions better, IMHO.

1) You would likely get enough coins per level to do what you would normally do before this update, even if you aren't trying to get coins. Simply trying to get more coins lets you stockpile.

2) This actually fixes the RNG issue with the game, allowing you to have way more control over your builds and effects.

3) The coin mechanic is immensely satisfying and a great implementation into this pachinko game. How else would you want to gain coins? Simply post combat coins wouldn't be nearly as thematic. Plus this introduces an element of risk vs reward for each combat, which in turn would reflect on player skill, not RNG as much.

The orbs don't bounce enough. It sounds stupid but one of the most fun things about games like Peggle is lining up your shot and having it bounce off 20 pegs and getting a crazy chain reaction. In Peglin if you want the orbs to bounce more than 3-4 times, hope you stumble upon a relic that gives you bouncier pegs. I swear the orbs in this game hit a peg, bounce once, and then have no momentum left and just drop in the hole. 

The enemies aren't readable like in a game like Slay the Spire. Most enemies follow a fixed pattern, but you only learn this pattern from playing the game multiple times. In a lot of games this is an okay method of learning, I don't think this applies to turn based games like this. The biggest issue with this system shows up in one of the boss fights, where the boss will attack once every 4-5 attacks, I've beaten this boss a lot but I still have no clue how often it attacks.

The enemies aren't fun to fight. The game gives you a method of attack, but no method of defence. Your initial assumption here might be that because the enemies advance towards you each turn, you have to have enough damage to kill them before they get to you. This assumption is WRONG. Half the enemies have ranged attacks, which means that regardless of how well you're doing, unless you get perfect luck then you aren't going undamaged. While there probably shouldn't be an expectation to be undamaged, it's not fun to take damage like this.

Self damage sucks. Same as the above about forced damage; Half the good orbs in the game have awful downsides: ""Take 4 damage when fired"" ""Take 15 damage when fired, increase self damage by 7"" What the fuck were they thinking? This also happens with one time per battle orbs. Yes devs, I'm sure my one time per battle heal of 10 would be gamebreaking if I had it 2 times per battle instead or 3 in a long boss fight.

I can't be bothered to write out everything wrong with this game. It's a good concept but the execution is lacking. Balance is awful.",1668344227,1668344227,False,20,3,0.540996015071868896,0,True,False,True

I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and will probably continue playing it, but the pachinko mechanic is perhaps not the best way to build around a roguelite game.  It has a tendency to miss the mark on consistency, and while standard for the genre, in this game you it can cost you a run on the basis of one bad bounce off a peg.

Overall, I'd give this game a 7/10; while the gameplay itself is quite fun (it reminds me a lot of peggle), the inherent randomness roguelites combined with the randomness of pachinko can be a bit tilting when you inevitably lose a run because you wanted to get the treasure chest and now have to instead deal with a combat you didn't want to do.

There are a lot of different and varied orbs that you'll pick up as you go, and other power-ups to try out.  The physics work well, the levels have varied opponents and challenges and it's fun (and often frustrating) watching your ball dance round the screen, only to just clip a peg and get diverted the wrong way at the last second.

There's an ongoing challenge mode once you've got through the three levels which increase the difficulty of future playthroughs.  I'm enjoying trying to get past the third challenge level - I haven't made much progress lately, but I'm still having fun.

The game seems to have got harder lately, largely due to the increasing numbers of different balls and relics available - it makes it much harder to get a combination that works well together.  When it first launched, you could reasonably rely on getting several bomb-related powers that made it a lot easier.  However, the devs are still working on the game, releasing a balancing patch a couple of months ago that did seem to improve things.

Hopefully they will tweak things some more and we'll get to a point where I can advance some more.  But even at this point, it's a fun pastime and at my usual target of and hour of entertainment for £1 spent, I've more than got my money out of it.",1666960356,1666960356,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I absolutely adore the concept, and used to absolutely love playing it, but these days, I feel like every time I run I do, whether I win or lose, I come away with a bad taste in my mouth.
The gameplay loop is solid, there are some fantastic choices of orbs and relics, but it's all just far too random, even for a roguelike!
You start a run, get a few orbs, or your first relic, and decide to yourself that you'll aim for a certain build. A handful of levels later, you realise that you have to abandon that idea because you've only been offered items/orbs/events that you don't need, so you start working on something else. This repeats until you end up with some kind of cobbled-together build that doesn't really work, and it's either vaguely good enough to beat the bosses, or not.
As with most roguelikes, more often than not, you'll end up needing to remove orbs from your deck for it to work properly, and in those instances, you probably won't be able to, because there are FAR too few ways to do so.
The only way that you can are via the ? spaces that appear throughout your run, but in my experience, I'd say about 50% of these are just battles, which don't help. A strong recommendation would be to either lower the chance for battles via ? spots, or just remove battles from the ? table entirely, as they really don't feel like they belong there.
A second recommendation, which may resolve the issue in a better way, would be to introduce some kind of 'shop' tile for you to aim for, similar to the way that Slay the Spire does things, where you could choose to purchase specific orbs/relics, or upgrade/remove orbs from your deck, which would allow you to hone your build in a more reliable manner.
I'd absolutely love to change this into a positive review, because as I say, I really do love the concept, I'm just finding it hard to actually enjoy at present.

They did add enough content to make it recommendable but it's still missing a lot of additional content. The additional classes aren't implemented yet and neither are further cruciball levels. Both are desperately needed to add more variety to the gameplay loop.

I loved the demo so I immediately bought it when it went early access. 

Good news is, it's even more fun than the demo with additional items, maps and mechanics. 
Bad news is, there isn't really all that much there in terms of content. 

Three levels and a, more or less, hardcore mode just isn't nearly enough for the asking price, even at the beginning of early access.

So right now I can't recommend the game at all. It's sad but it's the truth.

The physics feel dead, and shots never have the sense of building massive scores, and the recent balancing has made it even more dull to play. 

The point of a peggle like game is big explosions and massive damage. By having heavy physics that don't let the ball fly, and a system that reduces all the damage the more you complete the game, you actively make the game crap for people who take the time to play for longer. I don't know why you think low damage and forcing people to grind is better than a fun game, but i'm sick of it. 

Beyond that, the game is barely finished. It only has three environments, and the music is mid af. Do yourself a favour and just get Peggle/Peggle Nights. It is many times better than this hacky clone.

The reason I love Roguelites is because, if I make good decisions and get a little lucky, I can create ridiculous synergies that effectively break the game. You can do that in Peglin, like I did on my last run. The difference between most other roguelites and Peglin is that once you have the game on the ground with a white flag in its hand, other games wave it, Peglin sticks it up your a$$ and says, ""I don't give a $hit about your fun pu$$y"".

1. The physics of the balls on the pegs
In actual Peggle there's an almost pinball-like feel to the how the balls move, and it makes it really easy and intuitive to tell how the ball is going to interact with pegs. In this game, not only do some balls have different gravity effects (not a problem in and of itself) all of them feel really weighed down. It's difficult to anticipate just how the balls are going to ricochet, and also? It just doesn't feel good.

2. The starting relic power imbalance
At the end of the day, you only really need a good start. You can start a run with a relic like the Dumb Bell or Suffer the Sling and be set for the run. Or you could start with three really not very useful options, at which point it's really just better to restart the run and go again. This sucks and I hope the makers at least put in an option where, if you skip picking a starting relic you get some kind of bonus.

There's a bunch of little problems as well- the music is really repetitive and becomes grating, there is way too big a gap between normal and rare relic power, some of the peg boards, although cute, aren't well balanced from a numbers perspective.

The devs seemingly have no idea how to balance the game to make it feel good, it frankly feels almost entirely automatic at points, and I'm not super into just watching a ball bounce around a screen tbh.

Roundguard had active skills that actually meant you do something that matters other than shooting the ball, here you are literally praying to get good orbs and relics then that the RNG of the boards and run will also continue to be good, all with very little you can do to actually influence any of it.

There's a lot of orbs and relics that are seemingly entirely pointless, I have no idea if this is to have ""Bad loot"" or the lack of understanding of their own game from the developers, either way it leaves a bitter taste to come across any of these things.

It's cute, but that's about where it draws the line, because the gameplay isn't there.",1664727733,1664727733,False,8,0,0.535034716129302979,0,True,False,True

This is completely unacceptable. Peglin is a phenomenal game. It is a simple and utterly charming title, with the most appropriate art/ sound direction possible, and a soundtrack that never gets old. Make no mistake, there is a lot of strategy to this game, and the developers are adding new content at a great pace. Speaking of pace, the game is the perfect length for controller-passing. All of these elements make it one of the perfect games to share with a friend or loved one. My girlfriend and I play this game almost nightly, and have for a few months now. It's the perfect game for her, because she likes the 'action' element of games (ie: visual stimulus) and there is just enough strategy for her without being too much.

Now for the reason as to why I expect the game is being review-bombed: Peglin is actually a 'rougelite,' and it is very much [i]almost[/i] a hardcore title-- Nothing at all like Super Meat Boy, but definitely not a walk in the park like so many other self-professed 'rougelites.' Ah, I bet you weren't expecting to read that, were you? Yes, this little game can be, at times, barbarically difficult. Winning in this game is a balancing act between action, strategy, and luck. Even if you are an experienced player/ gamer, you are going to throw a lot of attempts at the wall before they start sticking-- and even when you are able to get some wins, they don't come consistently. Furthermore, there was a recent patch which either nerfed, or eliminated, some of the game's more promising orbs/ strategy, making it even more difficult. Some of these changes were reversed imminently in the following patch, which came a couple of days ago, but I digress. 

Here is what I have to say about this alleged point of 'negativity': It simply doesn't matter. Peglin is so much fun to play, even when you lose. Being able to laugh while getting frustrated, and experience a genuine thrill when you finally win it big, is the hallmark of excellent game design. This is such a hard thing to achieve, and is a commonality shared by only the world's greatest games. Among others, Peglin shares this element with Dwarf Fortress, a game which demands days of devotion from its players to learn, as well as games like Blackjack and Poker, which cost both real money and hours of maths study/ heartbreak to play. Do you see that? Those games cost something real and tangible to play. On the other hand, Peglin costs $15.00. There's no wonder as to why Peglin is so successful, considering that is basically an improvement upon Pachinko, another casino game. If you are able to laugh when something unexpected happens, even if it's at your own expense, you will really get a lot of laughs when you play this game. Peglin is an excellent game, and absolute classic in the making. Ignore the naysayers and buy it immediately... [and this is where the polite part of my review ends. Buy the game.]

Now, who should [i]NOT[/i] play this game?

If you are perhaps autistic, extremely impatient to the point of being mentally-defunct, or else a freak who is so obsessed with the destination that he closes his eyes along the journey, then do not play this game. You won't like it, because you will lose too often. If you play games only to get a cheap dopamine rush when you win, and then put your game away forever after ""winning"" a few too many times, then go jerk off or something and stop writing video game reviews. In fact, stop playing video games altogether. Get your disgusting, cum-stained hands away from this title, and other great hardcore titles which you are seemingly obsessed with trying to ruin; it isn't working. [i]""It's too hard"" has never, and will never be a valid complaint in gaming. Read that again: ""It's too hard"" [b]HAS NEVER, AND WILL NEVER BE[/b] a valid complaint in gaming.[/i] The gaming community at large hates people like this, who are the functional equivalent of compulsive gamblers, or perhaps parlor ladies that can't stand to be slighted in any way. In polite society, we refer to these people as the ""inclusive game design"" crowd, ""games journalists,"" or more colloquially as ""easymoders,"" and they are are the bane of [i]good[/i] game design. I have never taken people like this seriously, nor should you... However, I fear that a small developer like Red Nexus Games may begin to kow to them out of necessity, if their prized title should be brigaded by these bad actors so quickly after its release. This is part of my purpose of writing this review: Not only am I writing to share how much I love this game with you all, but also to offset the carnage done by these [+/-]80-IQ degenerates who are [i]Hell-bent[i] on ruining it for you before you've even played it.

In conclusion: Go play the game! And Red Nexus... If any of you are reading this, then thank you for making a good game and keeping politics out of it. Please do not listen to the easymoders in the review section, and keep finding ways to make this game more and more challenging and rewarding as you see fit; you have certainly done a good job thusfar.",1664717384,1664717384,True,0,0,0.383497953414916992,0,True,False,True

The main source of problems is that the developers care too much about listening to feedback from players and the result is a silly whimsical game without much well needed direction to make a polished game. It's entertaining but nothing special. The discord server is a spasm of speculation about possible new content and mechanics for the game without enough discussion about refining what is already in the game, each patch they add yet more overpowered orbs and relics which don't add that much to the experience (more on this later). The only thing keeping this game going is new content. One good thing that comes from the feedback from players are the relic and item names, the play on words is charming and meme-y.

The core of what is wrong with the game is that none of your decisions really matter when you are playing. This problem takes on many forms in game: excessive RNG, balance problems and general boring game design.
It should go without saying that a pachinko roguelike is going to have a lot of RNG, but the real problem is that your options are too limited and randomised to leave room for much strategy at all in the game. For a game about item synergy it doesn't give enough freedom in choosing the items, there is no currency system (so therefore no shop system) currently so you can only choose items from a random selection after a fight (if it even gives you that option, it could just offer a choice of healing or upgrading an orb). Although if you just want to kill time this game is great because of this.
Even with less restricted/randomised choices though, the game is still boring from a balance perspective because the different orbs and relics don't interact enough, they just tend to provide a new positive effect which is largely independent of other effects and they're all equally ""broken"" except when they're not. So choosing between items is either pointless or a no-brainer, neither of which are fun. There needs to be a lot more risk-reward type effects introduced, especially ones that could unexpectedly backfire or work very well depending on how considerate you are about item choices.
But the game is boring on a more fundamental level than just balance issues, some aspects of the general design are uninteresting. There is no lore, very little world building and the event scenarios get repetitive after a while. There isn't enough complexity in how different events influence later events or allows for new events to occur.",1664221029,1664376055,False,3,0,0.502444982528686523,0,True,False,True

Maybe this is all just me, but I'm going to give my honest view regardless.
I keep wanting to like this game, but I just think they miss the mark.

The first world has so many maps with such poor peg density that you get maybe like 5-10 max bounces per orb launched for the majority of the maps in world one. Which makes a bunch of orbs so much worse than they should be, and is just incredibly boring to experience.

Pegs often lack bounce (Not including the ones that have that programmed, such as slimed or webbed ones) and feel weak all the time. Also for the record, the maps that have the web/slime, have too much web/slime, it makes half your shots the exact same short as the previous one, and that makes the start of the game quite boring when you happen to get the web ones early. 

The slime boss that puts you inside itself, is maybe the least fun boss in any game I've ever played. His pegs are far too spread out, you rarely ever get a good bounce worth a damn no matter how good your orbs are. The idea of the boss I love, the execution I abhor. Just give it more pegs, even if it's more of the gross bounce stopping slime ones. His WHOLE BODY is made of slime, not just a layer externally coating him.

There are far too many ranged enemies half them and increase melee enemy damage. It makes bramble totally useless when more than half of the enemies you encounter do ranged damage for equal damage to the melee guys half of the time. Not enough penetrating weapons or splash damage weapons or luck based weapons. Bomb orbs are easily the strongest and it's not even close how much better they are.

This game is supposed to be about bouncing, maybe have less things that either don't bounce or reduce bounce.

The cruciball is absolutely completely and utterly awful. 1 more stone (a bad thing) but also your stones are weaker (also a bad thing) why would literally anyone with even a single brain cell, want that? Obelisk builds, sure. Let's make a whole new game system just to make 1 build better to start with. That's trash and boring.
Having finished a few more times, my cruciball is now level 4. Just adding difficulty isn't fun, especially when it's in such mundane ways. Oh enemies have more health, your stones are even worse, extra fire hole damage? that's the most boring thing you could possible do to add difficulty. I think I've hit those fire pits (misnavigation) maybe 3 times in 100 runs...

Adding no new complexity is just lazy. These wheel options should be buffs with bad caveats, otherwise there's literally no improved replayability after you complete the game... come on guys, roguelike:101 here, could not be a more basic mechanic for a roguelike.
You literally have items with amazing caveat buffs, they far more fit in the cruciball than the truly so damn boring difficulty increase in there so far.

The more I have played this game, the more angry I have become. Hopefully some of the classes and balance tweaks will improve this game enough, because I'd like to enjoy and recommend this game.

Here are some suggestions.
An orb that every time it's the one you are throwing, ramdomises somewhat. Perhaps some times it's high crit low main stat, some times it's medium both but penetrates, some times it has neither but converts blocks hit into crits or into refreshes, things like that.

A cruciball buff where you pegs start with needing 1 extra bounce to break (forgot the name of that stat, durable maybe?) but your orbs pass through crits, refreshes, bombs, and other non standard pegs, rather than bouncing off of them? (still activates them and breaks their peg)

An orb that is a boomerang. Normal orb in the peg board, but when you fire it, it penetrates through all enemies once and then comes back maybe? Lower stats but deals damage twice could be fun and interactive with mechanics like blind on hit, and any others that apply on hit.

Perhaps an orb or an item, that lets your shots hit only above and behind the target (like a grenade going on kind of thing, small aoe splash damage on the orb, could even be only 50% of the main shot's damage, for balance sake)

Also I think you need to nerf the item that increase crits multiplier for hitting multiple crit pegs. It's just too strong, it truly is so easy to start hitting 5000-10000 damage shots, once you have that. Especially when combined with Durable and the electromagnetic item. You can get to 3x crit in a single crit node and that happens almost the instant it touches the crit. I've gotten to 10x crit before and had I think over 20k damage from shots.",1663871599,1663976760,False,5,0,0.456687837839126587,0,True,False,True

With every update since then, the game's feels like it's getting unnecessarily harder or reliant on luck, rather than building up aiming skills with every shot or finding decent item combos. Nothing really gels anymore and it's a real shame.

I'm also not a fan of how recent updates focus on buffing enemies to unwinnable levels. Sure, Roguelites are supposed to be hard, but they also need have that element of progression where you feel you're improving with every run. By buffing enemies in this way, I don't get the sense that I'm improving. Unlocking new characters that change the game a little, or allowing some more freedom to finish runs would bring this game back to a healthier state. It could also do with a bit more variety in locales and enemy spawns, as I've spent far too long playing the same three levels.

Peglin's concept is cheeky and fun, and that alone is a good reason to keep an eye on it and not give up on it. I think that all it needs some TLC to bring back the fun while stripping away some of the emphasis on balancing in favour of the AI. In the beginning, When I first heard about it, I wanted to support it and I'm glad I did. I would have said that this is one of the concepts to watch, but right at this moment, I simply can't recommend people buy it.

By the nature of this type of game you either capitalize on synergies or work to make the best of a bad situation. My fairly off-the-cuff analysis is that there's three issues as it relates to this game: 1) the pachinko element robs you of the same level of tactical control you have in other Roguelites, the ideal action is often still be a 'misplay' on a bad bounce; 2) there is a lot of variation in quality between relics, so you NEED to get good RNG; and this would be forgivable if not for 3) the balance is just not there. If a game is difficult and has well-defined systems or tight controls then they can be overcome with wits and/or skill. This, on the other hand, is a game where you throw a ball and watch it bounce. 

In a better game I'm excited to start another run immediately.

From the get go, you don't really get to feel powerful unless you get lucky with some orbs and relics. It feels surface deep so the game is fun until the novelty of a new Peggle-like wears off.

The level design is less based around bouncing and sliding off stuff like in Peggle that's there to be satisfying and more about trying to make the ball hit the bottom of the screen as fast as it can unless you get a few certain orb types. There's only a handful of levels I like and many I hate. There's many orbs that are bloat or have negatives to using them and the same goes for relics.

Random encounters are best avoided because instead of being a mystery, it's likely just going to contain something you don't want. Enemy encounters range from being fine to just annoying or unfair. Combat feels really detached from the gameplay which doesn't help. You play Peggle and either your continue playing bar or your stay on this level bar depletes and what happens, happens.

The game is overly reliant on luck as a whole which isn't ideal for me. IMO rogue likes need to allow skill to offset luck and allow players to complete a full run. Sadly this isn't it.

All that said, it is in Early Access and things could improve drastically. Great idea, it has some great moments and it has a lot of potential. I just can't recommend it in its current form.

[i] Peglin [/i] is a blend of PopCap's [i] Peggle [/i] and the rougelike genre, a combination that works surprisingly well. Instead of accruing points by hitting the pegs you accrue damage that, once the thrown orb has fallen, will strike your enemies for the number you achieve.

Starting, you'll only have stones - these are your basic attacks - but succeeding each level gives you options to upgrade, remove, or add new orbs to your run. There are three stages that vary thematically and mechanically, but eventually you'll know what to expect as they aren't too random. I don't find the lack of stage variety detrimental as there are a huge amount of orbs and abilities to choose from - creating the perfect synergy is immensely satisfying. 

At this point in early access replay value comes from unlocking modifiers that make future runs more challenging, but this isn't really enough. I'd like more incentive to complete multiple runs in one game session such as cosmetic rewards for our Peglin. Lack of an official endless mode is disappointing but hopefully Red Nexus Games will deliver before launch (I believe there is an endless mode mod).",1662066311,1662216281,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Edit* 9-1-2022
Since my original review Peglin has now added custom game starts and CRUCIBALL! Which is similar to ascension in Slay the Spire. Difficulty is increased in some ways and increases replay value a decent amount! I'm looking forward to the classes that are supposed to be released in the future.

The game in demo was fun, relaxing and altogether a great experience. But specific updates has made most runs unbeatable. Some bosses are suited for very specific builds with very specific orbs which are given out at random, so if you do not have that specific build, sorry, you are either going to never win, or have to pray to the gods above for RNG to smile upon you. There are two main culprits.

A) The wizard in the castle. This wizard is completely unbalanced. Don't do enough damage early on? say goodbye to your run. For shields appear on every hit, and unless these shields are destroyed (which take around 3-5 hits, unless you have an orb that destroys shields in one hit) then his shield perk goes up... To the point where if you reload, it goes up twice, meaning you now need to deal over 100 damage in one orb to even start damaging his health. And if thats not bad enough, RIP if your refresh gets locked behind a shield, cause you will be wasting so many orbs trying to get to it as you have run out of orbs to deal any damage.

B) The upside down creature. Although the gimmick is clever, and unique, that is the only positive thing i have to say. MASSIVE health bar, DOUBLE MOVEMENT (so he gets to you in 3 turns) and since some update, the black holes don't have a strong enough pull most of the time to get the orbs hitting where majority of pegs are. Which means you watch as you get one or two pegs and the ball falls down the holes. 

These two bosses are ridiculously overpowered against the player, and I have found myself turning the game off for days after fighting them, just because it saps the fun from the game.",1661401469,1661401469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Health pools become inflated going into the second world forcing you to rely on either relics that make your orbs stay on the board for much longer but usually sacrifice any sort of tactical aiming whatsoever or just running all the orbs and relics that create bombs or refresh bombs.
 On top of that issue is that both of these strategies are basically interchangeable at any time they both synergize very well together since most of the bomb orbs and relics just want you to hit more pegs on the same shot. 
What makes this especially boring is that there is no dependable way to remove orbs from your bag so going for any other fun or crazy build is hampered by carrying around 4 or 5 rocks the whole game or going to random encounters hoping to remove something and just ending up with more filler orbs making your strategy even less dependable.
Personally i think having the most dependable and achievable strategies basically play the game for you just makes it tedious they're fun the first time you roll the entire game without effort, with what you think is a crazy combo, until you do it again and again because its that easy to pull off.

Yeah, dev doesn't know what they are doing.  All the changes I've seen since the original review have made the game worse while not touching horrible parts. Hardly anything has been added either.
A lot of the bigger issues are talked about all the time so the devs must know and either don't agree so want this to fail I guess or are unsure how to fix pretty easy, and obvious if any playtesting was done, design problems.

However the early game is extremely tedious no matter how much you unlock. There's so few pegs and the further you get into the game the enemies just have more health while the amount of pegs stays  the same.

Even with max speed the first world of this game is a slog so playing multiple runs just starts to get really boring, which is a problem for a Rouge-Lite.

However, if you can get past that first world the game does genuinely pick up and become super fun and exciting. There's genuine tense moments which is not something you'd expect from a peggle game.

If you want something casual to play with a nice, chiptune-inspired soundtrack and solid pixel graphics; or, like me, you played an unhealthy amount of Peggle back in the day and want to scratch that itch, you'll probably enjoy Peglin.

90% of strategies in the game simply don't work. 

You might go, okay. I have a small deck with a bunch of reload relics, so that'll beef up my relics and make me stronger. Sorry, that doesn't scale fast enough. You're dead before you have a chance to scale to anything, making all those relics useless.

You might have a really powerful orb, that can one shot enemies every time you use it. You've got a ton of damage. Oh, sorry. There's shields that absorb your entire attack while ranged enemies chip away at your health.

I'm not frustrated that the game is hard, or that it's ""unwinnable"" or I think it's unfeasible to win runs. My complaint is that there's currently two strategies that work, and everything else is kinda useless.

Those two strategies are: Bomb builds, and Orbelisk builds. 

Even with all the updates, these are the two builds that reign supreme. Everything they've added in the update for the most part is next to useless. There's just not enough AOE for how many enemies the game throws at you. You WILL take damage on every single room, and a lot on elites unless you have one of those two builds, leading to you eventually dying.

Not to mention, whether you get orb upgrades or more orbs is entirely RNG. I had one run where I duped all my orbs, and made it all the way to the second boss without getting offered a single orb for my deck. I just wanted an Orbelisk, due to having like 10 stones. But no, every single fight was ""upgrade or heal"". From a quarter of the way through act 1 all the way to the act 2 boss that I died to. 

Between navigation, rewards, whether you get upgrades or orb offers all being pure RNG, I feel like there's minimal strategy and you just bang your head against the wall until you win. I'm finally calling it quits due to how frustrating this game is.",1660304629,1660304629,False,5,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

The game itself has a great concept, but the game is far too luck based right now.  Most of the time when you lose, it's because of bad positions on your critical pegs, an unlucky order of your pegs, or some other chance based issue.  And that's a problem when you lose 2 hours on a single run only to die at the final boss because of it.  This needs to be addressed.  I have now lost 3 times on the final boss and wasted 6 hours of my life because of sheer chance.  Most rougelikes that involve RNG have ways to reduce the RNG as the run goes on (think how in Slay the Spire you can rather easily filter your deck to suit your needs with cheap, accessible card removal.  This is nearly impossible to do in this game, making synergizing incredibly difficult and mostly luck dependent.  If they made it easier to remove orbs (such as offering the option to do them after regular encounters instead of taking a new one, or perhaps instead of upgrading

It is especially bad on the final fight (you know, after you have already sunk far too much time into the run), making losses incredibly infuriating and feel like wasted time.  I think the main reason for this is the incredibly questionable decision to make the boss gain strength as the fight goes on.  It is nearly impossible to kill them before they output so much damage you can't do anything unless you get insanely lucky, even with a strong synergy of orbs and artifacts.  Even if you bring three healing orbs, it isn't enough.  Please either reduce the luck aspect or nerf the final bosses, and the game will improve significantly.  And also make me and probably a lot of other people way less frustrated.

I still put recommended because I think the concept is really strong, and if you don't get as frustrated as I do with losses nearly entirely because of bad luck instead of an actual lack of skill or strategy, you will probably enjoy this game a lot more.  But if you hate unfair losses like that, I'd stay away from this until they (hopefully) address this in a patch.  Just play the original Peggle.

The game has a solid foundation but could use some more development, and getting data and feedback from players is helping the dev(s) a lot as they actively work on the game and release updates. Absolutely worth the money if you have nostalgia for games like Peggle and you enjoy things like deckbuilder roguelites. 

The game is still early access as I'm writing this so I can't speak to the finished product, and if it wasn't still actively being developed and updated my opinion would probably be different, but so far my current 30 hours in the game have been very enjoyable. It could use a bit more fluff with the progression system to make it more interesting to get further in, currently you have access to all items on your first run and when the first build of the game was released, there were maybe half as many items as there are now. Starting out with some of the simpler orbs and relics available and getting access to more as the game was updated felt very natural, and some kind of progression system that unlocks more items as you progress through the Cruciball would make new runs feel more interesting and give more incentive to actually continue to play the game to unlock harder difficulty options. The luck aspects of the game can sometimes be frustrating when they don't go your way, but can also be immensely satisfying when they do favor you.

I'm not the type to give the game a number rating but if I worked at IGN it would definitely get a higher rating than Imagine: Party Babyz",1659817160,1659817298,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's been a few updates, and I can honestly say that the game doesn't feel as bad as it had beforehand. In fact a good portion of runs I have are great! Bomb builds are still insane, but I have had a good amount of runs that feel strong without the need for bomb synergistic relics and that's great! the new orbs that they've added are fun and can be very strong. The most recent orb added can also help with bad refresh orb spots which is something I originally did not like about the game balance.

I think the most recent update really helped the most, it helps alleviate the jump in power from stage one to stage two, and introduces a new boss and mini boss which adds a bit more variation which I love. The past two updates really just solved the majority of issues I had with the game, and I can wholeheartedly say that I'd recommend this game now. It's a fun roguelite concept that I believe will become even better the further the dev fleshes it out. Pick it up if it interests you!




(orginal review)
It's a fun concept for a roguelike, and I'm sure in time it will improve a lot considering it's still in early access. But it has some glaring problems that make it a less fun experience at the moment.

 The core issue is that the balancing is absolutely dire. The only realistic way you will win is through getting a build around bombs, otherwise you will almost always get overwhelmed and lose by the second stage. It isn't that the bomb build is overpowered (though it probably is) it's that every other ""strategy"" is severely underwhelming. I do not think a nerf of the bomb build is what is needed, more so other strategies need a serious tune up or alternatively the enemies need to be toned down in hp. 

Another problem I've faced which is not as big is some of the rng, mainly with how certain peggle boards are organized and the refresh orbs. I think the boards made are nice for the most part, and it's neat that they are thematic to enemies at times. The problem is that on some of these designs, bad luck with where the refresh orb is can cause you to waste multiple turns trying to refresh the board. This can cause you to essentially lose a fight because you got unlucky which feels really bad. Not quite sure how the devs would fix this because having it work like the crits could be frustrating at times as well, but it isn't the biggest problem if nothing is changed.

You should keep an eye on this game to see how it develops because I think it has GREAT potential. But for now it needs some big changes in balance before I'd recommend you buy it.

The RNG is even worse now with all the new relics and orbs.  I do not really find it enjoyable to sit there restarting the game 5-7 times in order to get a decent starting relic only to get lamed out with bad fights in world 1.  The Ooze elite is too hard unless you have the bramball.  They did make the minotaur easier, which is a plus, but there are still some real woofers for encounters in the first world.  They need to make all the orbs viable as a standalone or give us a way to limit what orbs we see.  I do like how some orbs combo and synergize very well with others, but the fact that you have to get these said combo pieces with the new influx of random orbs just adds too much frustration.  I only recommend this game if you absolutely love losing to RNG and/or you are a peggle master.

The boards in the first world are either ridiculously easy to clear pegs from or ridiculously hard to get more than like 5 pegs.  I really don't know what I'm doing, which is kind of bad game design considering I've played around 36 hours at this point.  I hate the randomness of your starting relic, and I find myself just resetting until I get a good starting relic AND a good map layout.  That's not all that fun for me.  If you want to be frustrated, then I guess I recommend this game to you, but if you're just a casual peggle player, then this game is way too hard to progress all that deep into the game.

But the viability of builds is a balancing mess. Especially the cruciball, which is playing through the game with difficulty modifiers, feels like throwing your runs against a brick wall and waiting for the RNG to give you good orbs. This can be fixed - Slay the Spire, which this game is extremely similar to, has 20 ""ascension"" (cruciball-ish) levels and it very, very rarely feels like you're cheated out of a win, once you know what you're doing. Peglin, however, is perfectly content to give you zero AoE options and put you into an act full of AoE fights while your lifeless peglin bleeds out. Don't get me started about the final boss (or the bosses in general). This is not helped by what I've seen in the recent experimental builds, which feel like they're constantly buffing enemies, this time adding a new mechanic that just says ""nah you're not getting that"" and preventing you from hitting the pegs. Pls fix.

Also add a 2x speed modifier for us multiball enjoyers.",1659578546,1659578546,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,True

You progress down a branching tree of encounters and depending on what you land on that dictates the encounter you do, or what rewards you'll receive. As you progress the levels get a fair bit more difficult, but with the right traits and additional Orbs you can add to your list, you'll cut right through. 

In its current state Peglin is a fun and enjoyable different take on Peggle, which I played for hours back in my WoW days when it was available as an Addon to play in between bosses. However it isn't without problems, though I believe almost all of my current problems will be irrelevant as more updates come out for the game, and post full release. 

My first main complaint is that there is a lack of variety in the game overall, or at least it feels that way. It took me 7 hours from start to end to beat a full run, and during that time you see the exact same stage layouts over and over and over. The lack of variance in levels became really obvious after just a couple hours, it feels more like a set campaign than a roguelikes changing nature from run to run. The only things that change from run to run are what Orbs you add to your loadout, and what Perks/Relics you get, everything else feels the same.

That leads into my second problem, a lack of variety in the Orbs/Relics overall leads to situations where you have a useless Loadout, and when you have a bad loadout its basically just a slow loss every single time, it feels like there's no way to recover the run. There's a couple Orbs that have synergies with others, but they don't feel like the synergies matter. With Relics you often see the same ones over and over as well, and there's a few that are significantly better than the rest that you would never not take. Matroyshka and the Short Fuse are both amazing relics that were always obviously better than the alternatives. This is also a minor issue in the grand scheme of things because I'm sure as time goes on and the game grows the options will grow with it.

And one of my last main complaints is a lack of Characters, but as you can probably guess this ends up being the same situation as the others which will get better with time. I would have liked more options at the outset, but as the game as a whole is relatively short as of right now, it wouldn't really change much from run to run. 

All of my problems with the game right now stem from it being Early access and I imagine as this game goes on there will be more added that fleshes it out fully and gives a bit more variety. The game definitely has its charm and is fun as shown by how I played for like 7 hours straight to get a win, its just that the fun was cut short when I realized I had basically seen everything the game had to offer within those 7 hours, and that there wasn't much of a reason to play it again.

At its core this is a cool concept and I enjoyed my time with the game. The fact that this is Early Access is very evident in the balance issues the game currently has. The first area is doable but anything beyond that will be a struggle if not simply impossible unless you have a build that focuses around bombs with one or two orbs that are big heavy hitters for most bosses. Enemies will have too much health or be too numerous to deal with without the bombs and without the heavy hitters good luck defeating anything beyond the first area boss. Area 2 and on everything has way too much HP while being way too numerous. 

Most of the orbs are pretty useless. The bramble orb seems useful until you realize there are about 5 other enemies with hundreds of HP behind the one that's stuck for a turn or two that aren't stuck and the damage done to them by the bramble is insignificant. There's an orb that passes through everything except special pegs which could be useful if essentially wasting a turn on it wasn't a death sentence. The only reliable healing orb I've found was a one and done for the whole game unless I wasted three upgrades on it which means I wouldn't have any upgrades on the orbs I needed to upgrade to actually deal damage. The list goes on and on.

In addition the relics make or break a run. Some are just plain overpowered such as one where your remaining damage after killing an enemy will pass through on to the next (if you get this early and build around it is the only viable strategy that isn't bomb centered that I've found). Other relics will make only the first reload of the fight a free reload which is essentially nothing.

On top of all of this during the fight the order of your orbs is is random every fight and is pretty make or break sometimes. You'd think ""okay well Slay the Spire you get a random hand of cards every turn, so what's the difference?"" but the difference is in that game you still have a choice on which cards to play. In Peglin you can skip one orb and then you're just stuck with whatever order the game decided to give you. You also don't get to see that ball until the next reload where it will again be shuffled in a random order. For example one orb does damage based on all the pegs you have hit during the combat. If you get that the first shot it's almost useless so you bin it. Then you don't even see it the rest of the battle because it was shuffled to the end or you finish before you even reload. This could be solved by doing a sort of hand mechanic like a deck builder or even just letting you hold on to an orb instead of binning it completely, swapping it out whenever you want similar to holding a piece in Tetris.

If balanced correctly and if the content gets expanded on this would be an easy recommendation but as is I would save your money and wait to see what happens.",1659044153,1659044153,False,7,0,0.520409941673278809,0,True,False,True

Specifically in one particular instance which makes the feature not worth having if it's going to be so random anyway; path selection for traversing the map. There is a world/dungeon map with branching paths, when you finish a level you select left or right on the path you wish to travel.  Unfortunately due to how random the bounce of the ball is I frequently end up going down the path I did NOT want.  Which is just hyper aggravating and not pleasure inducing in the least.  What is the point in offering a choice if there is such a large chance of the player not getting what they want. Might as well just be 100% random the whole time and save the user from thinking they can effect that part of the game.

It's not too late to fix this problem (simple solution, just remove every peg on the level when the player is picking left or right so their choice in that instance is respected).",1658616484,1658616484,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The levels are too reliant on consistently hitting refresh orbs that often get parked in the corers of maps with several turns worth of barricades to work through, and too many levels have a single row of objects to hit and an empty floor beneath them, or massive empty space parked between two vertical objects where they hit 1-2 pegs then fall straight down with no map floor for even a single bounce. The base speed of the game is so slow you can see the pixels ticking along, and even at the 3x speed (which you need to go back to main menu to turn on????) several of the moving maps crawl along at a snail's pace, forcing you to sit and line up shots for agonizing amounts of time. The Cruciball challenges are uninspired and feel like a total drag, not offering a challenge so much as a relic slot machine (more than your typical rogue-like). Too many relics and orbs have power levels so far above others that there is no room for build variety. The more unique options require synergy to be any good and you have no time to pivot into them when the stars do finally arrive due to how short runs are.

Sure, you can sort of aim where you want your ball to fall in the first two or three bounces, but after that all you can do is pray that your ball doesn't do something stupid like falling straight down. It sounds like a little grievance, but because of how often that occurs, there's a decent chance that in any given run you will have one disastrous fight where your ball falls 5 times in a pit doing like 10 damage each time, and you end up dying. That's all it takes to lose.

Just a clarification for people who have't played the game. In the first world, some of the basic enemies have up to 200 health. You basic balls do 2 (or 4 with crits) damage each hit. Meaning you need to hit between 50 to 100 pegs to kill one enemy! With no control whatsoever over how many pegs you will hit. And of course those are not the only enemies in the fights. And that's [i]just[/i] the first world.

The core issue is that there's little to mitigate that RNG. There's a really solid base to do that that's currently in the game – the different balls you can buy, and the relics you can get – but it does not go far enough. There should be more options to buy and sell balls. There should be more control over what relics you get. Most of the relics are useless. Most of the balls have questionable use as well. The navigation system is cute but adds another layer of grievance when for some reason the path you want to take is full of pegs but the other side is completely open. The fight rewards are frustrating as hell too – too often do I get the option to upgrade a ball when I need health, and no upgrade option when I'm at full health. The game needs [i]less[/i] RNG but instead adds more of it. And I know that's a big ask, but just one ACTIVE mechanic during the peggle shots would make the entire game feel less like a gambling simulator. Like the nudge you could do in Space Cadet for example.

Don't get me wrong, I beat the game like, 10 times? And it was fun! Because every time I won I used a bomb build and became insanely overpowered. Here's the deal: Bombs have a ton of relics that synergise with them  (recombobulator [i]especially[/] is a win runner, in combination with any other bomb relics); bombs do full piercing damage (as opposed to other balls with piercing that can't actually target all enemies, like flying ones); bombs do an instant 30 damage in 2 peg hits, more than any other balls can provide.

But that's it, really. The one and only way to mitigate the RNG is focusing on getting as many bomb orbs you can get and bomb relics – but of course that's still RNG whether you get those or not. Bombs runs are the highest highs. Everything else can turn into the lowest lows in one fight.

If things change by the time 1.0 is released, I'll change my rating but I have little hope there's going to be drastic changes.",1658040755,1658040755,False,2,1,0,0,True,False,True

This game is easy to learn, hard to master. I play games of all difficulty levels, from point and click adventures to Hotline Miami. This game is approachable and pretty easy to learn, although there are nuances that the game does not do a great job of teaching, which will hopefully be fixed with a better tutorial system in the future.

Peglin is basically the Slay the Spire of Pachinko. If you didn't like Slay the Spire, you won't like this game. If you don't like Peggle and pachinko, you won't like this game. Procedurally based games and physics games and pachinko games all have heavy RNG elements.

The same way I would not give a negative review to a time management game for requiring meticulous micromanaging, I would similarly not downvote a procedural game for RNG or downvote a pachinko game for RNG.

Slay the Spire lets you choose your own path through a forked path system. So does Peglin -- and, just like Slay the Spire, you can pick from combat, mystery, boss, and treasure rooms.

Slay the Spire lets you create a custom build by collecting artifacts that offer permanent benefits. So does Peglin -- e.g. items that permanently increase bomb damage.

Slay the Spire lets you build a deck of cards that are randomly shuffled at the start of a round. So does Peglin -- except instead of cards, you have pachinko balls that have various effects.

My husband has never played Slay the Spire or a similar game. He tried this game on my account and got all the way to the third area on his first try, by taking the time to learn the game, read the text about artifacts and cards, and building accordingly.

The RNG on this game isn't shitty. It's just like Slay the Spire, if not easier, because all content in Peglin is unlocked from the start, unlike Slay the Spire. If you don't like RNG and procedurally generated games, you will not like Peglin. If you get mad about RNG, you will not like this game.

This is a game where build matters. Some items and balls you can pick are really incompatible with each other! Others make ""overpowered"" builds. I have never had a run where I couldn't make a fun build that kicked ass. 

Just because someone thinks a build is overpowered, broken, and makes the game broken, that doesn't mean their opinion has anything to do with whether or not someone else will like it. There's nothing stopping a player from making an underpowered build as a challenge. 

There is also the issue of confirmation biases regarding whether a build is overpowered or not. For instance, my husband likes multiball and refresh builds. I like Nosferatsorb builds. He is plays more multiball than me so therefore he is better at multiball because he put in practice. 

You see this same argument with any game where a character can specialize, because of confirmation bias fueled by the fact people pick the same builds over and over and then complain the game doesn't have replay value.

If you want to get the most out of this game, learn to play it, try different builds, and go in with good faith and have fun. You will die. A lot. But you know what you'll also be doing? Playing pachinko the entire time, with no cutscenes or any filler. You're going to be doing what's advertised, which is bopping pegs and smooshing enemies. How far you get is up to you, your skill level, how much practice you put in, and yes -- a little RNG.

But, not knowing how a game works and being surprised by an enemy's scripted behavior isn't the fault of ""RNG."" Yes, the game takes skill. So what.",1656729149,1657733941,True,0,0,0.457818925380706787,0,True,False,True

The developers are still adding content and while one of the things making me have less fun with the game may well be fixed, the other is more doubtful.

The first, and most fixable, issue is balance. bomb builds are by far the strongest, and no other build can even hold a candle to the damage they can deal. They only have one drawback depending on the items you pick up, and even that can be mitigated if you get lucky and find the right healing items, which brings me to my main concern.

Yes, nearly all roguelites have some reliance on luck. However, the best roguelites are the ones where you feel you have at least some agency, some way to influence that luck, whether it's being able to spend currency in a shop on a selection of specific items you might want, or some way of directly nudging the RNG to favor certain item drops. Other than an initial item selection, this game has none of that. You get what the game gives you and it either works and you win, or it doesn't and you lose. In addition, your entire run can just be obliterated by the pegs that refresh the board spawning in a location that's impossible to get to without wasting multiple turns to brute force it. The RNG of items mixed with the RNG of the peg boards themselves ultimately spoiled my experience after my first few wins.

However the spread between good and bad runs is extreme. Bomb builds are very strong, and you are very reliant on the rng of the pegboard to do any significant damage. As it is currently, there needs to be buffs to the weakest relics and orbs.

I both love and hate the RNG that comes with the pegboards. Certain orbs just don't bounce well, or you almost feel like the game is conspiring against you to make every shot as unoptimized as possible. Other times though, it goes entirely the other direction.

1) No run variance. The variety in your runs stems from the relics you gain, the orbs you pick up, and a few other factors. Normally this would sound fine, but two things are missing: Class and enemy variance. From what I can tell the amount of bosses in the game is pretty low at the moment. Especially considering how little each boss has in terms of animations or complex interactions. On top of this whenever you go through an area you always face the same 3-5 enemies. You might argue ""Other roguelikes are like that"" to which I would agree, but then argue that STS, Dead Cells, and Risk of Rain have multiple ""paths"" at every given level. Stage 1 is not the same everytime, however here it is.

2) The price. This game is comparing itself to the likes of roguelike giants. Risk of Rain, Dead Cells, Hades, etc. If the game was 5-10 dollars, I would say pick it up, but when you're charging sometimes MORE than these games, you need to compare yourself to them. 

Now despite these downsides, there are upsides. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend the game.

1) The developer actually cares. The team is showcasing off the next few updates, and they are promising to fix the issues I have above. There is a lot of potential.

2) The content which the game does have is superb. Even someone like myself, who hasn't played games similar to this one (peggle) in over 10 years, can see the depth in the game and the polish it has.

I used to play it quite a bit and while there was a really fun core to the game, I always felt that the experience as a whole was way too swingey and inconsistent. More often than not, you were only really just waiting to get all the big, broken stuff that auto-won any run you were on and every run that you couldn't secure that, you just kinda had to cross your fingers and pray that you can somehow scrape by. Since it's official early access release, it seems that direction the game has taken at this early point is to completely double-down on the inconsistency. Whereas before you were able to just weather the storm and just barely make it by, if your run isn't already good before you reach the first boss, you might as well just hit reset, because the rest of your run is just going to be a slow, methodical march towards inevitable failure.

Before going on to list alot of my gripes, I need to emphasize that I do think that the core game itself is very fun. It is just basically just using Peggle to supplement an RPG battle system and it works well enough. When the game is actually firing at all cylinders, it has alot of the elements that I enjoy from roguelikes. It has a great breadth of variety of options to change the way you play and there is a thrill to finding a combination of items and balls that works to melt enemy formations before they get a chance to even move. It's just that alot of the systems that are built around this core are currently incredibly discouraging and brutally unforgiving, to the point, where your runs feels more like a luck of the draw than anything else.

I place much of the blame of this on alot of the new items that have been introduced since launch. The game has had a bit of a time experimenting with alot of ""Risk vs Reward"" items, things that have benefits counter-weighed by drawbacks. In most roguelike games, I would see this generally as a positive, as it encourages playstyle and defines how you play. In Peglin though, it doesn't quite work. Mostly because your control over the game is already very limited by the fact that you are still playing Peggle and while aim is a part of it, aim can't help you if you have just bad placements for refresh and critical hit pegs. With the way alot of these items work, getting a certain item can actually just completely brick your run, unable to deal almost any damage without a very specific lineup of balls and other items to support that playstyle.

However, there is still alot from just the initial demo that is still causing issues. The rate at which you heal at base, while good enough to get you through the forest, will most often mean you are basically losing the run, because you are losing out on potential upgrades. Not only that, but upgrades being random between upgrading balls or getting new ones can very easily leave you in a bad situation, where you either lack the tools needed to deal with future levels or lack efficient firepower to deal with enemies fast enough, which means you take damage that needs to be healed, which means sacrificing upgrades, etc. These kinds of slipping game-states can occur far too easily with just a single bad luck of the draw.

While there is alot of potential for this game and while I do have confidence in the team to address these issues, the game is currently in an unfortunate position, where their first few steps forward have felt a little iffy to me. The way the game is right now, I can't say I can fully recommend people pick the game up just yet, especially for the price it's asking.",1657129628,1657129628,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Frankly getting to the cave and beating the game there just ends with you looking down a tunnel, when I beat the game on my first run ever and was presented with that ending, my thoughts were just ""that's it?"". I understand that this is not a full release, so the lack of content may very well be made up in the future, but that is the key phrase here, ""in the future"". Buy this game if you are intrigued by both the concept *and* the game play that you see, but be prepared for pretty consistent repetitiveness in enemy encounters and map design which is so cookie cutter, you feel like you're not only replaying the game, but living in the same moment.

However: There are many thing that could make this game amazing, and I will list my ideas here:
1. Changing the map to feel less like a Slay the Spire direct copy.
- The map makes the adventure seem bland and without much excitement. By making the map less basic and maybe adding an actual 2-D forest to trek through via your normal navigation patterns, that would make it much more immersive. Additionally, add more variants of spaces or locations, seeing exclusively the Boss, Floor boss, Enemy, and question mark spaces make me exclusively pick the question mark since a lot of the games charm and interesting features are only contained in those random encounters. Branching it off into different types of mystery encounters or sub-genres with colourful markers would allow for more skill expression whilst awarding player knowledge and strategy.

2. The Orbs are amazing, but it would be cool to see us actually charge up the attack whilst the ball is knocking down pegs.
- By making the Peglin charge up an attack depending on how many pegs and how high the attack value will be (with variations depending on if it's like, a projectile or magic attack etc.), I imagine it will look a lot more appealing and interesting. Giving enemies some sort of idle animation akin to a 2-D fighter would also add a charm and make them seem less cookie cutter.

3. Finally, add another area(s)
- I've seen that they are planning to add an optional boss at the end of the cave with a shorter room of encounters and a *very* difficult fight, but that addition could even be made AFTER the third place with another buffer area in between and maybe a bit of balance tweaking to allow the user to continue playing through all 5 locations now, with 5 being the optional challenge area. My runs at the moment tend to either be extraordinarily overpowered or spectacularly awful, so by editing the balance and adding another full area between the cave and challenge, you can slow the pacing whilst making runs more consistent in power rather than a firm high and low roll.

Thank you for reading my review, note that it is only not recommended in its current state, if there's one thing this game has in spades, it's potential.

As you succeed at clearing levels you are given new orbs that act differently to eachother when used, and different artifacts, each one fundamentally changing the way you play the game.

I would say that at it's core, the game is fine and I would nominally recommend it based on how well it works. Unfortunately, there are a few major balance aspects and one gameplay mechanic I feel would be better off being removed.

Balance:

Bomb builds are simply the way to go. In my time in playing, the only wins I got were with bomb builds. With any other build, I wasn't even able to get past the second level. This is not a call to arms for the developers to nerf bomb builds, and I'll explain in a moment.

As a roguelite, the game, unfortunately, relies heavily on RNG, that is to say, the ball itself. I don't feel that it controls consistently, and the basic aiming arrow is not nearly useful enough to lead an accurate shot. I would extend it by 25-50%. But that aside, even a strong build can get a very quick game over because the ball nudged a single peg, flew across the board and straight into the gutter. I suppose that's just part of the game, but it makes the game absolutely brutal when you consider the following.

I feel that all the enemies have far, far too much health bar the starting enemies. And usually, the entire track is full of them so playing anything less than a bomb build, or a ice or ghost build is straight up asking to lose. If you get the two logmen (who have 300hp each) as your first encounter, just reset. You can very easily find yourself stuck in a loop where you are forced to take the HP restore after each encounter because you had the audacity to play something other than an AOE heavy build, and now you have no opportunities because you constantly have to top up your health.

Taking this into account, a quick reset button would be much appreciated.

The one mechanic I would honestly like to see removed is having to slot the ball into the path you want to take. In some instances, the ball making a sudden 45 degree turn and dunk straight into a mini-boss instead of the chest you were aiming for is usually an instant-reset moment. Just let us choose a path instead.

As it stands, I can't recommend this game to anyone except extreme peggle/pachinko lovers, because the roguelite elements clearly need some work.

EDIT:

I would like to stress that this is not a bad game. If it's on sale and you want to kill a few hours, go for it. But while the peggle/pachinko half of the game works almost flawlessly, the roguelite element does not. There is no meta progression, no unlocks, nothing to try and tip the scales in your favour aside from simple luck in a run. Some items and builds are so clearly superior to others that you are simply making things harder for yourself for not pursuing them. 

Critically thinking, progression is what I'd like to see most in the game. Perhaps by unlocking the orbs first, then being able to start with a different loadout, would go a long way. I'm just spit balling here (pun intended).

I do have hopes for the game as it is still in early access and still receiving updates. Maybe check back once the game fully releases.",1656460882,1656505319,False,149,6,0.689960241317749023,0,True,False,True

However there is a huge problem with this game and thank god it's not any higher than $18. And the big problem with this game is the imbalance between the bosses, sure it's a roguelike; but something about the imbalance as many others have said and I'm throwing my opinion into the mix is that the game just really loves you not putting it down till you beat that specific boss or act. Now I'm not saying it's a bad thing -- far from it; but when it's basically dick-waving with a ""git gud"" sign and that's far from okay. Yes, we love the challenge, yes we love seeking revenge against a boss. But it's about taste and execution her and my god is it poorly done with it hence why the imbalance is such a huge focus.

If the runs are fairer in terms of dishing out fair boards (the images you see of balls floating in mid air? That's the board), and if the bosses aren't absurdly imbalanced then this might be a great indie game to enjoy.

================================00

Tl;dr: 

It’s a fun game. Casual on basic difficulty, requires some strategy/luck/skill at higher difficulty levels. Bad luck can be hard to mitigate.

The game was very much overpriced when it came out. Compared to other games in the genres (peggle-likes, rogue-likes, and peglin-roguelikes), it is still very pricey and I recommend waiting for a sale unless you are very sure about the game.

================================00

When it came out, the game was very shallow for a rogue-like, and very imbalanced as well. There are still quite a few two-item combos and three-item combos that can pretty much break the game, but at this point there is an increasing amount of depth. Likewise, these game-breaking combos are much less likely to occur, now that there are many more orbs and relics.

Random chance can still very much make or break a game. Unless you get at least one solid orb/relic or combo going early, you may become trapped in a loop where you can barely improve your Deck because you have to heal after most fights.

I highly recommend adding something like a shop (similar to Slay the Spire, for example). Give the player a choice of, for example, 10 orbs and 5 relics… but at a price. Even adding only a single shop-like event during the whole game would really help players work towards builds, and reduce scenarios wherein you are basically waiting for specific orbs/relics to pop off, knowing that your current build will not be able to survive the late-game fights.


================================00

Once you get going, skill often loses more and more importance. Unlike, for example, Slay the Spire, where you are often still fundamentally changing your Deck and strategy on floor three, here the same combo from the first floor will often remain barely altered until the final boss.

Likewise, the ""Peggle skill"", which is to say strategizing where to aim and actually managing the right bounces often becomes nigh obsolete. As a consequences of the layout of many late-game boards, as well as many relics and upgraded orbs, aiming is often practically useless beyond the most basic concept of ""aim in the general direction of where you want to hit stuff"". 

If your orb is literally attracted by every one of up-to hundreds of targets, if the targets are constantly moving, and if you throw up to 16 orbs at once, then it’s mostly random chance what will happen. However, this depends on your specific Decks, and some orbs can reward strategy/skill throughout the game

First and foremost, the developers seem to be very focused on making a challenging game. While I normally enjoy difficult roguelikes, this is peggle were talking about. The hugely chaotic and effectively random nature of most shots past the first one or two bounces means that skill will only take you so far, and adding permadeath to the mix just leads to a really bad feeling every time you get bad luck.

The pixel art hurts the game here as well, since it's harder to tell how your shot will bounce off pegs which function as circles but have chunky, blocky edges.

Refreshing the board is absolutely essential to clear fights effectively, but the only guaranteed way to do that is to hit one of two randomly located refresh pegs. If you get bad luck with the spawn locations, it's easy to end up in a situation where you just have to waste multiple shots carving a path to the refresh, which is frustrating.

Lastly, there just isn't that much content, certainly not enough to justify the price tag. Runs get repetitive quickly.

While I understand that it is an early access game, as of June 2022, [b]I cannot recommend buying this game for the hefty price tag that it comes with[/b].

Visually, it is an engaging game. The cute pixel graphics are lovingly-crafted, and they're definitely the main thing that will keep your attention for at least 2 hours of gameplay. It also has appealing audio design, which is great, because every good Peggle-style game needs to have satisfying ""plinks"". The graphical design of the different orbs you can obtain in your run is also interesting, even if they don't have as much of an effect on gameplay as you might expect.

I found the best parts of this game to be the parts inspired by Slay the Spire. The relics system - although not quite as robust and varied as StS - did keep me engaged, at least until I realised that not only were there relatively few relics, they also had little to no synergy with each other. Even the ones that you might think pair well together don't seem to make a tangible difference in how the game plays from round to round, fight to fight, or act to act. Similarly, the random events with extreme parallels from ""that other roguelike"" (probably one of if not the best roguelikes of all time) were also enjoyable for the first few rounds, until you start to see repeats. And believe me, you will start to notice the repeats very quickly, likely long before you finish the game. 

Enemy design is interesting, until you realise that there is little to no variety in what they actually do. Normal enemies are minor annoyances that die quickly, elite enemies are annoyances with a dash of bullet-sponge. They overstay their welcome. There is little difference between the types of enemy you face. Occasionally, you'll find gimmick enemies with a special mechanic that actually impacts your strategy, like the mirrors. These were cool the first time I encountered them in Act 2. Finding out that they repeat into Act 3 was a bit of a bummer, and make me feel like [b]the ideas ran dry before they got to that point[/b].

The finest example of the ideas running dry is the Act 2 Wall Boss. Literally a wall with a high health pool and no interesting mechanics. It does not attack for however many painstakingly slow turns it takes to reach you, at which point you are dead. You are playing Peggle with/against a brick wall that does nothing to you, and your only goal is to complete the damage-check. That's it. No strategizing whatsoever.

There isn't much strategy behind the random events and what choice you pick. Often, either way, your build gets shafted, and you end up with a hodgepodge of special-effect pegs which don't feel very special or synergize with each other. 

Peglin is missing that element of control over your destiny. You have very little control over your build, very little control over the path you navigate down (if you're blocked by pegs after finishing a level), and ultimately, very little control over the outcome of the game. You will immediately begin to feel the drain as soon as you finish a run for the first time, if not before then. I cannot imagine this fundamental failure of the game becoming any better without significant changes throughout future development, which is a real shame, because I want to like it very badly.",1656202537,1656203192,False,3,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,True

The gameplay is pretty good, and the QoL options really help you skip a lot of that downtime waiting for the ball to drop. Overall satisfied with the game, a great spin on the roguelike genre.


Very, VERY fun game, but not worth the price tag quite yet. Get it on a good sale (more than the 10% off that it's got currently), or wait for it to get a little bit further into early access. It is pretty easy (and rather RNG reliant but what roguelite isn't) to beat the game and doesn't take very much time, the playtime you see on my account is split between my brother and I so take half of that and that's how quickly you can expect it to be over, some reviews are saying they beat it within their first hour.

They are very clearly working on a progression mode called Cruciball that's in its early legs right now. Not super inclined to try it yet, but when it reaches it's full form is probably when this game will be worth it, but even then I feel like it needs just a little more in the department of items and orbs. Two or three runs in and you'll have seen every orb/relic the game has got (though I am certain they'll be adding more down the line if they know what they're doing).

[b] The Good [/b]

 There's something about these Rube Goldberg machine type games where ""it's away!"" is both addictive and fun.  While there is RNG, nothing about the pachinko room feels unfair. But the game is pretty challenging.  I'm about 3/15 runs, hence the ""it will eat your quarters"" style arcade game.  Still fun though.

There's clearly a concept of ""Builds"" - bomb based (which goes poorly for the final boss IMO), crits, multiball madness, etc.  The ball variety is pretty good and that is what makes the game the most fun.  The fact that enemy positioning matters is pretty cool too.  

[b] The Bad [/b]

It's true, at current state in Early Access I can see myself playing this game exactly another 20-25 hours and it will just get too monotonous.  At present it gets about a 5/10 replayability.  But for $18 US, I think it was worth the price.  My rule of thumb is I should get at least 2 hours of entertainment for every dollar and when it's done I could see somebody spending 100+ hours on it.  

I'll say more below, but when the RNG is unkind (like... no decent ball offers the entire first act) it is brutally punishing.

[b] The Ugly [/b] [i] (Psst - Hey Devs, here's the feedback to improve the game!)[/i]

I'll start with the obvious - you need more rooms, more bosses, more mini bosses, more enemies.  Sounds like there's other characters planned too?  Cool.  Right now this plays like a $5 mobile game, but it could be almost slay the spire level good, with a bit more content and balance.  

Add a merchant (? event) with 7-10 different orbs, artifacts and BALL REMOVE!  Since health is the game's currency, just use that.  This could be very easily implemented as is.  Make this event more frequent, like 20% chance.  Maybe make a ""buy nothing"" to heal 20%.  This will do a tremendous amount of RNG removal to the game, because of shitty maps and bad reward RNG.  

Make rewards consistent / predictable about the enemy rooms, whether it's acquiring a new ball or getting an upgrade.  That doesn't seem like it should be random.  The current design removes skill in both map pathing, and can just fist you royally when you're rolling into the end of act 1 with three shitty lvl 3 stones.  

There are some artifacts that are absolutely OP.  Let me know if you want me to share which ones.  

There are some orbs that are simply ""uncompetitive"" because they will leave you in a really bad spot for the final battle.  Maybe that's what skipping is for, but it would be cool if there were an artifact that let you choose a ball from your inventory.  

One idea is a ball that deals little damage but ""pushes back"" the enemy, a la brambles holds them down.  Perhaps a ""Blue bomb"" or something.

The one bug I've found is sometimes a ball will stop on a moving level and just... despawn.  Seems like if teh ball is detected as stuck it should auto bounce in a direction at random slightly... not just despawn.  Fucking brutal on the last boss when this happens because riding the platforms is the entire strategy.  

Anyway keep it up, it's a fun game.",1655683227,1655688203,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I think we've all seen roguelite elements applied to many game genres by now, but roguelite Peggle is a new one for me. Peglin is refreshingly unique. Each run starts out a little slow, but they get fun once you get deeper into it and start collecting orbs and relics. The effects of these items interact with each other in interesting ways, and THAT'S what makes every run feel different; not the enemies or the boards, but your build. It's fun, and it almost has an addictive mobile game quality to it. You'll die only one or two turns away from defeating a big boss, you'll get frustrated, and then you'll hover your mouse over the quit button for a few seconds before thinking ""...nah, I can do one more run."" Peglin's a good time waster. And it's really solid for an early access title. There's not really any game-breaking bugs or anything like that. Peglin just needs a little more variation when it comes to its boards and levels, the ability to choose classes, and a drop of polish. Considering it's status as an early access game, I'd expect all of those things to come with time.

I don't really have anything glaringly bad to say about Peglin. It's good for what it is, and it'll probably only get better with time. If you like Peggle or other pachinko-esque games, and if you like roguelite elements, give Peglin a try!",1655647687,1655648458,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

due the the relics being mostly random with you having little choice over them and the main synergies coming from orbs-relics combos rather then orb-orb combos (other then stone orbalist) you are often put into the position of picking the same orbs every time and ending the game with the same deck every time. If previous orb choices had an influence on future orb choices such as lighting orbs combo-ing with water orbs you would get a lot more end of game deck differences. 

that all being said this is a very fun game with more content to come and i can only hope that the game moves a little away from pick the best orbs and hope you avoid the killer relics.

Here's why:
-The balance feels off...
-The projectiles feels sluggish or lose inertia way too quick and not fun while some items makes the projectiles move in what I feel should be ""normal""
-Some levels are almost impossible to do well because of the lack of ""pins"" while some other you absolutely can't fail at as it is impossible for your ball to reach the bottom without mid tripple digits minimum.
-The game had benefitted by not making all the ""pins"" the same shape and doing something with the side walls too, but they didn't (as of my review).

All in all, the core gameplay loop feels unsatisfying and like you can't really Skill your way through anything as the trajectory feels random at some times and rigged at other times.

TL;DR - buying the full game isn't worth it.

I played the first world (in the demo) for maybe a dozen times. I think it is the most balanced and enjoyable part of the game. Buying the full version gives you two more worlds, but as the relics begin to stack on top of one another and the enemies get exponentially harder, the element of skill and strategy begins to recede, and you end up blind firing shots with increasingly more chaos. 

Given how quickly chaotic the game becomes with the collection of so many relics, I don't see how the developers are going to add more content - the final world is already out of control. The game needs to be paced down to allow for more of a slow, fulfilling build-up of power-ups and more powerful enemies. 

The peg boards in the more advanced levels are also much less thoughtful. Most of them consist of several hundred pegs scattered in some semi-coherent pattern in which you fire and watch the mayhem unfold. It's somewhat satisfying, but loses a lot of replay value and charm.

Whatever algorithm controls the receiving of relics should have more control over which relics are offered to the player at which stage in the game, and ensure that the player begins by receiving small improvements, and the enemies get incrementally harder. This would prolong the campaign and allow for more of a focus on how the user actually plays the levels.",1655168119,1655168119,False,7,0,0.542091727256774902,0,True,False,True

At the game's current state, it takes approximately 1 hour to complete the game. Apparently that means I must have played it more than 70 times by now. (It took lots of attempts to beat all the currently available cruciball levels and then I went back to play it again and again on normal difficulty just for fun.)

I'm super excited for all the content that's going to be added in the future and even though I think the game's pricetag is set way too high right now I guess (and hope) it will be worth the money when it's finished. I would recommend you to play the demo before buying the game and considering that after that forest area there are only two more areas coming and that's it.

The game does a great job in wordplay and even the German translation is pretty nice (usually puns are hard to translate and often get lost but not in this case).

The Cruciball settings go from mildly challenging to frustrating real fast with the missions becoming nearly unbeatable if you don't get certain items or orbs by certain points. Power up can become wildly dangerous in late game and you can bring yourself down to zero health with splash damage from your own bombs from full health.

The most annoying bugs I have encountered mainly center around playing with a controller, where the controller will not be available for input during certain moments, namely the end of a successful run and during the pachinko relic obtaining segments.

Item balancing is pretty impressive for a game as early in development as this one, save for the sapper sack, which I still believe could use a drop from 150 damage to 100.

I had several level 3 Orboros, since the bonus damage for my shot was going to be 300+ I decided to have fun and not hit a single peg for the final shot. 
I threw Orboros straight down, and killed the cube. However, the game did not end, the cube animation was still spinning but was an empty box, and I could not shoot any more orbs, or do anything. I recorded a video of it after that and will post that when I figure out how to do that. 
I had to go to the main menu to leave the game, and had to completely redo the fight. Luckily I still won, which was nice.  It was my first win on lvl 1 Cruciball. 

Great game otherwise, and just thought this was a neat bug. I will continue to enjoy this really rad plinko adventure game!

I wanted to like this game so badly. I heard about its announcement ages ago, and grayfruit's playthrough of the closed demo back in late 2020 had me decently excited for the release of the game. However, at least in my opinion, the game fails to provide a fun experience on nearly all aspects.

The music is okay. I wouldn't go so far as to call it ""bad"", since it takes a genuinely talented musician to make bad music, but the tracks are more average than anything.

The general style and direction of the game is quite endearing, and it's probably my favorite part of the game. The ball puns are cute, I like the creativity with the item designs, and the different boards for each enemy group are really cool.

The gameplay is... Well... Pachinko. I wouldn't necessarily call it worse than pachinko, but it's definitely worse than Peggle. Part of the joy of Peggle was how easily controllable the ball is, and being able to do trickshots, slick shots, and bucket bounces feels REALLY good when you manage to pull it off. I can't quite place why, but the ball feels unruly and hard to manage in Peglin, especially when you're trying to refresh the board. Combine that with the necessity of hitting specific pegs in order to actually deal serviceable damage, and it quickly becomes VERY frustrating.

The roguelike elements feel very forced, and as much I want to like the interesting ideas put forth by the game, I can't shake the feeling that the twists and interesting mechanics of the game are derivative and downright lazy in places. The Slay the Spire formula just doesn't work if you can only draw up to two cards per turn (three with a very specific relic), and you can only play one, and enemies have ludicrous amounts of Health, and you can (usually) only attack one enemy at a time.

On the subject of enemy health and AoE damage, the balance is easily the worst part of the game. You either make a bomb build, or you're playing the game wrong. I know that sounds very pejorative and closed-minded, but I'm being serious. Sapper Sack increases your odds of winning by 500%, and every Bob-Orb increases your chances by 100%. Bombs are the only thing in this entire game that can deal enough damage to push through the stupid amount of health and numbers of the enemies. And oftentimes, even that's not enough. There is a specific miniboss in Area 3 that is a darkened room completely filled with enemies, each of which have something like 777 Health EACH. Even with a bomb build, the room is completely ridiculous. As well as that, the Wall Head has over 7000 health, and if he makes it all the way to the player, you instantly die. I don't think I've ever beaten the boss without either Sapper Sack or Electromagnet (which was nerfed to hell in a recent patch). Animated Ruins is also a ridiculous boss, but I've only ever seen that boss three times, and beaten it once. In 11 hours of gameplay, I've only ever seen that boss THREE TIMES, and the one time I killed it was before the balance patch that made it harder.

I sincerely hope some major changes are made to the game, since I really want to like it. But as it stands, I just don't have fun when I play this game.",1654529766,1654529766,False,10,0,0.558786749839782715,0,True,False,True

so many stage setups are nasty, like slime and disappear one(ghost? i forgot), orbs are just not bouncing but going straight into the hole in slime
bombs are fine, red bombs are suicidal w/o healing relic, many orbs are too weak
stage 2 mobs are even stronger than stage 2 elites, w/o hammer relic or aoe orbs, shield mobs are annoying, archer hits for 4 every round and priest? hits for 3 almost every round except it heals ally sometimes, while i have only 100 maximum hp? just no

Pros;
Unique game, pretty much peg based games are underused.
Good progression, very good progression although some of the fights are badly made in my opinion.
Cons;
Very very easy, the upgrades are too strong especially the boss relics.
Very much luck based, this can be taken either way but RNG in any game sucks even if it is a rogue like.

A fun little indie game for the first 3 hours during which I got my first clear. I started on the harder version and stopped playing after another 2 hours of not getting anywhere and feel that mode needs more balancing. The game is more of a true rougelike since you don't unlock powers or become stronger after a playing for a while. Replayability isn't there yet as the three levels don't give you time to build out a strategy and your more of just going along for the ride.

Technically the games controller support and full screen windowed mode worked flawlessly for me. I'd say the game should be priced at $5 right now for 3-5 hours of play. Hopefully they will add a lot more content and bring its value up. Some sort of money gathering system that allowed you to buy power-ups would add more depth to this game.

Several levels are fun and you can kinda get this rhythm about how you're meant to throw the balls for solid damage, but there are multiple encounters that will just completely end your run if you're unlucky enough to get them through almost no fault of your own or your build. 

First terrible encounter is the Minotaur miniboss on stage 1. The peg arena is shaped like the Minotaur's horns along with some sparse pegs underneath it, and you can tell you're meant to slide your orbs down the horns for good damage; however, the Minotaur's health is way too high and most of the time you won't have any orbs strong enough to take him down before he makes his way towards you and start chunking you for 22 health every two turns. The pegs underneath the horn pegs are way too spread out to get good damage on him, and in the worst cases the refresh board peg will get stuck underneath the horn structure which means you can't do any damage until you clear all of the multiple pegs blocking it, which allows the Minotaur to end your run. Three-fourths of my runs end when I have the misfortune of rolling this miniboss, I've just learned to restart my game when I see him.

Second potential wiper is the massive ballista boss of stage 2. Most encounters in stage 2 are very fun and relatively fair even if your orbs aren't very strong, but the ballista is able to deal 30 damage within a few turns of the fight starting, and will repeat the attack every 5 or so turns afterwards, of which 2 of those will leave you with the confused status, which causes your aiming to go crazy. Between its large health pool, ability to outright execute anyone who has low health from earlier in the stage, and requiring AoE to deal with its constantly summoned minions that will block individual shots for it. It has ended quite a few runs that were for all intents and purposes going well beforehand, and there is no clever way of avoiding the massive damage it can put out unless you get specific relics, which is entirely RNG-based.

Last terrible encounter is in stage 3, where you will encounter two worms who attack from range and a conga line of suicidal peglins that will blow themselves up for 35 damage when they get in melee range. The peglins have way too much HP (450 each) and the the real kick in the teeth is the pegboard, which are multiple moving diamonds with red bombs you're meant to hit to deal with them, but if you pick up certain relics such as 'The Gift That Keeps On Giving' which causes all pegs to take three shots to break or unless you have a very specific orb (lightning), then your orbs will immediately slide off the diamonds and fall into the abyss. The moving diamonds mean that if you can't hit these bombs, then your orbs can't gain any kind of purchase and will just fall to the bottom of the board without dealing any real damage. Runs that should have been winners have all failed at this one particular encounter, and between resetting my runs to not get stomped by the previous encounters only for this one to always appear and ruin my run, I no longer have any desire to play this game anymore.

Resetting after a failed run is long and tedious because you need to grind through the same few encounters again and again, hoping for the types of orbs and relics that will actually give you a fighting chance against the encounters that ordinarily would end your run (bomb builds are effective in every encounter, give you a chance to kill the Minotaur and ballista, and are extremely effective against the last boss) only to get completely stomped in the very last stage because the you didn't get the one orb capable of saving you from a single endgame encounter.

I would strongly advise against getting this game as it is currently, encounters need more polish and general counterplay so that you don't eat shit because the game decided to pitch you encounters you're utterly incapable of dealing with.",1653877033,1653877033,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The main gripe I have with the game is how RNG dependent it can be. At least to my knowledge, it is completely random if you get an upgrade or a new orb at the end of a battle and due to the massive scaling enemies get between acts, this can literally lead to a dead run if you are unable to upgrade your orbs. This is also extremely frustrating in crucible mode where if an R peg gets in a bad spot and you don't have very specific relics, say goodbye to your entire 30+ minute run. I feel like the reduction of R pegs in the challenge mode just feels awful as it just takes the game out of your hands.
Apart from this, I would say the game is pretty good and I have put a lot of time into it, I would recommend as a casual game but not for someone expecting an experience akin to a game like STS due to the RNG dependence.",1653777785,1653777785,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

""Peglin"" was cute enough and seemed to have a lot of potential, especially for people that were fans of not only ""Roundguard"" but ""Peggle"" as well. After seeing the way the Dev's of ""Peglin"" dealt with critical posts on Steam Discussions about a week into the release, and also after a very nerfy update around the same time, I began to have doubts. 

Aside from pulling posts that were mildly questioning of the price point, they seemed to not really care to listen to customers input if they offered constructive criticism. Combine that with no real road map as far as development is concerned, and lackadaisical attitude in general towards suggestions from people that clearly want to see the game succeed, more alarm bells began to ring. 

Now that posts are being pulled from Steam Discussions by the Dev's of ""Peglin"", I had to review it. I don't recommend supporting this title as it is, especially at a $20 price point. If they really want to make this title succeed, they need to listen to ALL the players, not just the ones that support every single thing the dev's state they are going to do or ""maybe implement at some point *add dismissive tone*"". 

Follow the game, sure. Read the discussion's and give feedback on the Demo, sure! I would simply ask that people observe before purchasing. Play the Demo, ask questions, and engage the Dev's, that, I think, is the only way to squeeze value out of the game for folks that already paid full price. To all those people that played ""Peggle"" and had the satisfaction of ""I made that shot happen"", don't expect that here. It all seems so directionless... much to my disappointment.

The way you create builds with orbs and relics reminds me a lot of The Binding of Isaac, in the best possible way. 

For being in early access, this game has an impressive amount of variety throughout the three worlds that are currently available. The recent balance changes are very welcome, and the upcoming class system is a good idea.

The rest of this review is directed toward the developers of the game about a few little tweaks I would make:

Please, PLEASE give us a fast forward button like in Peggle! I like the enemy movement animations on the top, but after many many games, it ceases to be useful information, and just wastes a lot of time.

I understand if you don't want to make it right click, since that currently works as discard (which is very useful to have as right click) but maybe fast forward could be done by holding middle click or something?

Another thing: at the beginning of each game, the player is greeted by a random selection of three relics to choose from. It doesn't make much sense to have it be a random selection, since they can just immediately back out of the game and reset until they happen to roll the relic they want.

Making it into a picker menu would be a very satisfying answer to this problem, where the player can select exactly which relic they want to start with, but a passable compromise would be to just simply add a 'reroll' option to the existing selector instead.

One other thing that might be more on the personal side of things: the slime boss is too damn hard, and unfun to fight. I do like the concept of the orb launcher's location changing when the goblin is consumed by the slime, but that gimmick doesn't really add to the fight. Please make that boss more interesting and less of a grind!

Thanks for all the love and energy you've clearly poured into this project. Gamedev absolutely kills people mentally, and I hope you're doing okay through it all. Much love!!",1653167439,1653167439,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Every week is removing fun things.  They need to decide which way they wanted to go before selling the game since the demo was when it was peak fun.  Now it is okay but I cannot recommend cause I see the developer looking at what is fun and just removing it.  Also this update they finally added a new orb.

1. Some orbs are practically unusable. It might be fine for a game like Slay the Spire to have useless cards since there are more than a hundred of them, but for a game that only has a dozen of orbs, this significantly limits the variance of playstyle and hence the replay value. The relics are very unbalanced either.

2. Some maps are very hard to play. If the refresh ball (R) gets spawned in an awkward position it's very difficult to play.

Minor issues:

I. When an orb gets stuck for a few second, it disappears and is considered a lose orb. That doesn't really make sense as the orb is still in contact with the beads.

I have one specific gripe for the gameplay, and general ideas on how to fix it:
- Speed up button. Sometimes you throw a bad orb, and you just sit there watching it bounce around hitting nothing of importance.... mocking you and your failures... So instead, you hold the space bar or something, and the game speeds up to 2x speed. I would in general make the gameplay faster (especially when enemies are attacking which feels like it lags behind the general gameplay).

However, while the game play is great, it's clearly an alpha title in the content department. After 4 hours of game play, I seem to have experienced everything the game has to offer. 

Some content I'd like to see added:

2-3 more characters that change the way the core game is played. Would be a simple thing to add some archetypes like archer, wizard, etc. that change how pegs work or anything. Anything to mix it up.

Some type of curses or otherwise negative perks. Right now the only really bad relic is the self-damaging bombs. In later stages its common to full clear a board multiple times, so it's possible to clear every red bomb at once, killing yourself. 

Shops, or some form of player choice mechanic. Right now adding cards to your deck is simple, but there's very few options to remove cards. It was common for me to have 10+ cards in my deck even when being hyper selective.

Major balancing. Even 3 hours in I was finding the content trivial; no boss or encounter lasted past my third card, including the final boss. In my third run I did over a million damage in a single shot. A hard mode or ramping up mode would be obvious (and seems to be in productive) but it goes beyond that. I was clearing each fight in the first 1-2 cards, and the only time I was in danger was killing myself with red bombs in the stages where they spawn naturally.

More bosses and enemy variety. 

The music is good but the game needs more tracks. 

An option to speed up the peg bouncing would be nice. There were times where I had to wait a full minute to finish bouncing around. Maybe a button you can hold to speed it up 2x speed at least. 

I think 3 levels is about the right size, but maybe alternate zones to mix up each run. Ascending instead of descending, etc. 

Overall, game play 8/10, music 4/10, and content 2/10. Looking forward to checking in to see if there's anything new in a few months.",1652713174,1652713174,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I congratulate the devs for this fantastic weird and cute idea of a game, and a flawless execution of it. I'm looking forward to having more and more maps. My cute peglin needs more enemies to chase.

10/10 as far as I'm concerned, and I'm really picky about my games.

No pressure, yet the challenge is there. I love it.

Well worth the money on early access, and even moreso after the full release. Definitely recommend this, specially to anyone with adhd-tendencies and a thing for a roguelike ""might have to try again couple times, and then go again a few more for fun"" stuff.

- New Characters with different starting line ups or orbs, board special peg counts, or starting items.
- Some long term benefits that turn it more into a rogue LITE  (IE, items that once unlocked, are permanent baseline upgrades)
- A harder challenge mode (already in beta)
- Some way to make the first 3 ish rounds of every playthrough not feel the exact same.

At the moment, the game is very RNG base so there isn't really a sense of being able to customize your build at all. Certain builds are only available if you hit certain events and I hate the coin/luck relic with a passion. Not all bosses are built equally either, as the bull mid level boss is probably the worst peg layout while the plant boss is so much easier by comparison. At the same time, in the second stage, the demon wall boss is basically one massive DPS check and is so much more difficult than the ballista boss. I've only beat the wall once, and that's because I had so many bomb relics going. Other times, I had rather strong heal builds, but demon wall don't care about heal builds at all. Only eating little peglins.

There isn't a lot of control over adding things to my deck vs upgrading them, so the current gameplay just feels like ""spam for as many relics as possible because you'll never get a deck you like."" The RNG is what dominates the game at the moment. That's my only complaint.

Currently, if I get a really good relic layout, I'm winning battles in four turns, so it takes me about an hour through all three areas. This isn't a compliment or complaint, just a general statement of gameplay as it is. Confusion relic go brrr.

Otherwise, I do like it a lot. The level designs are nice and always interesting. Each area feels vastly different from the last. Sprites are gorgeous.

I really look forward to what the final game will be.

Four or five music tracks, 3 stages with 2 variables on the boss per stage. You spend the majority of your time in the beginning stage.

Fighting a spider? It's a web, and the most un-fun board in the game where ""sticky"" pegs slow your ball down.

The stat building aspect of the game is what makes it interesting from other peg games. The sad thing is you're limited to a few types of weapons/relics or else you can straight up kill yourself from your own strength. And if you do in fact get lucky and land on a god-build, there is no ""fast-forward"" option. You have to wait and wait and wait for your ball to finally leave the screen and kill the one mob with 5 health on the screen with your Stone lv. 1. And that's indeed if you don't land on a level absurdly overloaded with enemies compared to other boards in the same stage. Your run can end in no time when you arrive at a board you simply didn't get lucky enough to deal with.

I'll just say what most are saying as I have to agree... Not worth the price, but...!!

it's well worth the replayability. Granted, too soon to tell. Being early access at this point. The game's gotten this down rahter well, just keep adding to it. I'm actually enjoying going back to this every update to see the difference. Haven't actually lost a fight yet. Most peeps just don't realize the power of the cookie relic with the refresh orb alone, and that bombs do 50 to everything but not to you... getting a bomb orb to make more is a discount way to handle the small fry that poke, or those spiders that you can't quite snipe, but without the bomb refresher relic you'll start to lose peg slots so it becomes a slight risk. as for the red bombs and this strategy... that's the point behind them. They deal damage to you too. if you have the cookie and a refresher orb, you won't need to worry about dying any time soon if you know how to peggle. especially if you manage to make the pegs durable. I have yet to get a run without the cookie and even went without a refresher. The chances of bouncing into a refresh tile or having a relic that makes crits refresh... oof. The game isn't hard. Even Cruciball. It's about knowing how to work around the board. I can see where it could be hard, but in the words of an archer who changed over the years: ""It's simple Geometry."" or rather once you figure out every orb's weight and can see into a jump or two... eh... it'll come in time.

Anywho... I'll be saying 7/10 at this time. Needs more to it. As it stands there's less to it's generations outside the unique mechanics of being a peggle game than practically every other deck builder game. However, it's very good as it is. A more realistic price for this game would be about $9 or $10. Don't quote me there. I'm no price expert. It's just what I'd be willing to pay. My friend went out of their way for this, so I'll give a review. It's entertaining enough that I even did this in the first place.

PS: I actually enjoy the music. Enough so, that I wish there was a DLC for the soundtrack. I'd give more info, but I'm no writer for details beyond my knowledge as a gamer, sry. No programmer knowledge or anything of the sort to nitpick the finer details and give input on the mechanics of the game outside what I experienced like I put above.

The gameplay itself feels fine, having played the demo I was pretty interested in what else the game had to offer. The blend between pachinko and rougelite mesh well. I do look forward to what other areas will be left to discover, what new potential relics and events might be added, and most importantly- what new boards might show up. Getting stuck with the minotaur as often and as early as I do in runs can really sour the potential of a run. I don't mind the minotaur as a unit since he's pretty scary and all, but the board the minotaur uses doesn't feel like it has too many good shots. Hopefully more variety in units or boards will alleviate that issue for me when more content becomes available.

When I first purchased this game, the boards were a bit odd but there was never a situation where I felt like ""man, this doesn't really tickle my fancy the same way Peggle did"". Every board, like Peggle, was fun. Every powerup, however oddly worded, felt enjoyable and like you could make a build around it using others. Rarely was there a situation where me losing was something I couldn't chalk up to being bad. I even recommended it to a bunch of my friends who liked Peggle or Slay The Spire, giving it ludicrous amounts of praise.

And then the game got updated.

Now, the boards feel unspeakably bland, and all the fun powerups have been neutered so much that having them feels more like a crutch than not having them. New powerups feel like they hardly do anything even when they trigger. Honestly, everything feels like it was intentionally made less fun. Runs that used to be tough but definitely completable have now been reduced to two-board wipes that force me to restart due to lack of pegs to deal damage with. Where there was an interesting idea that felt wacky but well-executed is now a game I'm almost considering taking back my shining recommendations to friends.

THAT BEING SAID, I get it. It's early access, they're still working on it, stuff has to be ironed out. It could very well be that the next update of this fixes all of these problems and more, and the game becomes as good, if not better than, it's former self. It happens. And when this game gets another update, I will gladly take another look at it, see how it feels and adjust this review accordingly. But until then, the phrase ""It's an Early Access game, take it with a grain of salt"" is best felt with this game in particular. It might be your cup of tea now, and I hope you enjoy it if so, but don't bank too hard on it staying the same.",1652143138,1652143138,False,4,0,0.512234032154083252,0,True,False,True

Right now in it's early access this game is very narrow minded in what builds it will let you play with. And I don't mean a limit to the orbs though I would like to see more variety in that. To explain, there is a boss on the second tier that auto kills you once it reaches you. It is a damage check boss. But if you're running a slower build like what I did the first time I reached him, one with lots of healing, you can't do anything to him. It's very annoying that there is a boss in this game the completely invalidates a playstyle this game lets you play, one that was absolutely destroying everything up until that point by the way.

I will also say that the power curve in the game is extreme and as of yet I don't see a lot of builds the game gives you the chance to play being viable in them. I think the game needs to do a lot to broaden the curve with more levels or longer levels, and more varied bosses.
