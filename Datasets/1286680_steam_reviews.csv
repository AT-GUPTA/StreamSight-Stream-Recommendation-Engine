The class system they introduced was an interesting concept, but overall feels like it limits you by locking you into a more specific set of abilities.

I did not expect that there is a worse game than Borland 3 and quite boring at that, but here it is.
[spoiler] Let's leave aside that even when it starts, it asks you for a lot of permissions that could have been set when ordering the game, not when it's bought and waiting for you to play. The game is full of gays and lesbians and transvestites and what not even from the regular ones. They played with the colors in such a way that it looks unnatural. The people design is just a skin on a scarecrow. You can't tell the difference between a man and a woman or a goblin. They have gone a bit overboard with the amount of gays, but mostly with too many dumb emotions to such an extent that they are so sugary that it makes me sick. Almost everyone inside is losers and unfortunates, even the villain, and they have gone terribly overboard. And they also mock and overdo it quite a bit, with other characters and some even from their other games. I have the feeling that it was made by Disney with the addition of modern crap. A lot of the missions are either gathering lovers or more emotional garbage. Even at times it gives you a non-violent choice. After you pass the stupid campaign, it gives you 30 minutes of credits, so you can't skip them. Showing all the idiots who made this garbage. So many people don't have an iota of wit. I expected that I would be a bad ass, not a donky ass.
The maps are few and big but empty and most places are visible when you choose to pass the mission because they are all straight lines and not many tasks. Kind of like this part of the map is for a task and sometimes there is no life until you pass the task. There are secrets, but most of them are trash or coffins with trash, and most things it's only worth it when you collect them as a set. Separately, the game from the outside is full of uninteresting arenas, which is the main thing in the game. Which you just have to kill a certain number of enemies, but the enemy is always watching, so there is no point in looking around or sitting in them for a long time. Most weapons are garbage, the rifle has a very bad recoil. The rifle is quite weak. And the price of special items in the store becomes quite high and you earn too little and the upgrades for more ammo and to carry items skyrocket. But then you find so many items that it makes the store meaningless and you only sell because most of them are weak.
They decided to add swords, but most of them are weaker and have many disadvantages compared to firearms. There are many downsides to them and they are more likely to kill you if you focus on them. And again they do the same as other games just for protection. So they haven't achieved anything new.The spells are not so well made, the grenades were more useful, you can use more but they are not in the game. You choose characters that you can change whenever you want without two things quite impersonal. One is the points card and the second is the class, but then it gives you a second one and in the end you can change even the second one. And the class is one third of the old characters. If you rush, you may miss a conversation because another conversation will cover it or miss it. The game has bugs and even the internet affects it. But the balance is the biggest problem. I started on easy, then on normal and I realized that it makes no sense at all. You raise the level and the enemy with you, but he is always weak, you kill the bosses in seconds and they are at your level. And most bosses are poorly made or just bad ass but a little different. Enemies quickly lose their originality and are quite poorly made or pathetic. And the exploding barrels are even more dangerous than the enemies and sometimes some enemy hits so hard and unnaturally that it crushes the armor and almost all the blood quite unbalanced game.There are only 40 levels that are raised quickly and then it's just paragon points like Diablo 3. Weapons will always be level 40 and the enemy and you will never be able to cash out more than that. There is no game plus and there is no point, you beat the game and it unlocks an endless arena to go around in a circle. And you fight for slightly stronger weapons. Usually, by the time you reach the middle of the game, all the things you need to wear are unlocked, but not here, you have to go through the entire campaign to allow you to wear a second ring. And the items are poorly thought out because you use everything even on the other classes and you have to choose constantly because of the bad way of use. And because of the bad balance, I don't even change things for a long time, especially at level 40. Achievements are the icing on the cake, you can pass them with only one character.  I have 5 achievements left, two are grinding and the bottom is extreme grinding for nothing because you don't have enough money and the game has no plus and two are simple but they want a second player. It could have been done without them, given that the game is more for one person, rather stupid of the creators. And most of the hidden things you collect don't even have an achievement. The game ends rather stupidly and pitifully.
The most impudent thing about these lazy creators is the price. They want as much money as their previous games and the game is not even half and the season package is not even a quarter, pitiful. 
Tina's old adventures in DLC of the second game, it was true that there were bugs and it was for balancing, but it is a hundred times better than this shit in every respect, even emotionally. [/spoiler]
I would recommend that these lazy creators balance their game and add stuff equal to the price and fuk off.

I also have over 500 hours across the Borderlands series on Steam alone so I'm well grounded on the franchise.

I'll start off with my own personal opinions -- have never played D&D before, so the main theme and dialogue of the game doesn't interest me too much. I also consider Tina to be+ by far one of the worst/cringiest characters in the franchise, so basing a whole game around her was hard to push through at times.  It also didn't help the entire game is narrated by Will Arnet, Andy Sandberg, and Wanda Sikes, and while I don't really have anything against them, their attempt at 'trying-too-hard-to-sound-funny' dialogue made it feel like I was playing through an SNL skit.  

As an avid Borderlands fan I think it's safe to say Wonderlands is probably the worst entry in the entire series.  The game replaces the open world/vehicle elements with an 'overworld' where you become a funko pop variant walking from place to place. The Myth(or 'BA') Rank isn't even unlocked until max level, which really makes you work for what used to be available at all times in previous games.  And for the full edition players, the DLC are the absolute worst in the franchise.  

Some other notable, but not terrible changes are the removal of canon characters replaced with a 'character class' system, which isn't too bad, and makes room for more playstyles, but takes the fun out of playing some of the series now iconic characters.
The removal of the Grenade slot now replaced with a Spell slot, which I have found to be quite fun and actually enjoyed.

Overall, for $60, buy every other Borderlands game instead...they're much better and have much more content, but if you can find the game on sale for about $20 it's worth the money for avid fans.",1708292014,1708292504,False,3,0,0.409393668174743652,0,True,False,False

But, I'll start off with the positives.

The Positives:

+The Gunplay
 It has a good feel to it, feels like it has a impact.

+The Sounds 
 Sound effects range from fairly decent to outright good, feeds into the feel of the gunplay a lot.

+Melee Weapons
 A good addition, melee was fun to play in BL2, but drops off in the OP levels, so weapons might help keep it more on par with guns.

+Spells, I guess?
 Not sure if I like them or hate them.
 They are interesting if nothing else.


The Negatives:

-The Writing.
 The game's writing took no time to showcase how bad it was, it couldn't go 5 minutes without going ""hey, funny joke right? Laugh!""
 The main cast, Tina and the 2 randoms, can't shut up for 1 minute with their stupid comments or even worse ""jokes.""
 Playing with voices turned off is likely the best way to play the game, and that's really sad given how dialog seems to be one of the main parts of the game, but it's just so bad.
 In BL2 finding a voice log was cool, you learned more about a character, or some funny interaction, but in this game?
 The first random voice log you find is painful to hear, the ""jokes"" were so unfunny, and yet they repeated it, basically going ""it was funny right? I'm going to do it again!""
 This might be the only game to punish you for wanting to learn some more lore.

-The Art Style
 The change in art style made everything look so.. off, borderlands 2 had a much better style to it.
 It also made combat feel very weird, as enemies don't stand out from the background/terrain like they do in BL2. 

-The Health Bars
 I'm guessing there is a different color of health bar for each different type of enemy, but the one for skeletons, the starting enemies, had no thought put into it.
 It's grey, but the bar color for when it's damaged is white, making it almost impossible to tell at a glance if it's about to die or not.

-Pronouns and Body type A & B
 Why someone thought this should be a thing, I have no idea.
 It doesn't effect much of anything.
 But I hate that so many games see the need to add in this stupid political stuff.
 Keep that political BS out of games.


-Small Stuff
 There are other things, like how you can't do the classic esc>end>enter>up>enter to quick quit to the main menu.
 And there is likely more stuff, but I didn't like the game enough to keep playing.
 The gunplay was fairly good, but the writing was so bad.
 Every time I heard one of those awful ""jokes"" I kept thinking ""I paid money.. for THIS?"" so it just wasn't worth it.",1707869995,1707871381,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

The world lacks cohesion.  The different zones are kind of just there as an obstacle to the end boss.  They don't tie into the story in any way.

The weapons don't have any character.  Sure, the brands are there in an off-brand way, but all of the weapons can have elemental damage and they just blend into each other.  In the previous games Mailwan means elemental submachine guns.  Jacobs means high damage, low rate of fire sniper rifles, and so on.  They are all here, but then everything can have an element, and the styling is not very unique to each weapon.

The character skill trees were not clearly understandable to me.  I picked some stuff and left it.  If equipment buffs any of my selected skills or not, I didn't really care because the names are meaningless to me, and the icons are hard to extract meaning from.

The characters were fine.  I like their banter and Tiny Tina is Tiny Tina, but inside this fantasy world she's not quite the same.  As a story teller, she's not the best.

The enemies are also not very memorable.  All I really remember is mushrooms, pirates, and land sharks.  Why am I fighting them?  Because they're hostile.  They don't have an agenda, they're just monsters.  The lamia/serpent ladies have something, but that's about it.

The overworld is easily the part of the game I liked the least, especially with the random encounters.  It's very tiring and not interesting.  I'm playing a first person game, I kind of want to navigate the world in that way.  I'm aware that I'm supposed to be playing a tabletop game, but it doesn't feel like it, and I don't think it has to.

I want to like it, and there are some interesting things in it, but I can't recommend it unless you want to play every game in the series.

It had a fun (though quite standard) fantasy atmosphere with a heaping serving of Borderlands style combat, which is really quite nice throughout the whole game. Plenty of interesting loadouts to be had here, though with a distinct D&D themed twist compared to the usual Borderlands formula: spells replace grenades, wards replace shields, and so on. Melee weapons are also much more prominent in Wonderlands. At first they seemed like a nice addition the Borderlands style of play, but they ended up being a bit redundant for me personally (why use sword when have shotgun?)

Unfortunately the bland side quests, average dialogue, and the utterly repetitive and uninspired ""encounters"" that the game likes to throw at you slowly whittled away the fun. There were a few good moments for sure, but in the end it all just continued to wear us down to the point where we just wanted to get the silly main quest over with and be done with it (and even that was a complete let down).

I would also recommend avoiding this game if you aren't at least a somewhat avid fan of D&D. Most of the jokes and character banter depend on scenarios and tropes that frequent the D&D meta (honestly the whole story could be seen as one giant commentary on the peculiar relationship that builds between players and the dungeon master.)

But they turned the gun play here into something akin to spell shooting with tricks and gamuts on the guns that really made game play stunning and clever.  Shame they traded emotes for spells in the quick menu.  Would have been very useful to have a range of spells at my fingertips than corny dance moves.  For all it's faults in mechanical objectives it has great points for style aesthetically - the dialogue is great.  The quest stories are quirky and fun and goofy.

You want no control over what bosses and mini bosses you face, right? Then comes the loot in general, kill a boss? Have 3 greens, 3 blues, maybe 2 purples and rarely a legendary. Part of what made borderlands rewarding in the past was taking 5 minutes to sort though loot after defeating a boss, this game takes 10 seconds. I'm not saying Legendaries and purples should be everywhere but they shouldn't feel like a chore to get.

No new game+, No finding dice again, no resetting any quests without a new character.

Also, Slot machines are gone, so if your friend is sorting loot, the best you can hope for is to kill crabs.

Final plus is that quest rewards appear as the item of the day in vending machines so that's nice.

Edit: Two years later, I played 5 more hours, this game is even worse without the hype surrounding it. Generic and repetitive dungeons done again and again.

Imagine you wanna play diablo with your friends, or destiny or whatever some multiplayer looting game, now every quest you accept, and turn in, in fact every quest objective you complete, your friend makes you all stop playing the game so he can show you this cringe recording of this guy bombing at stand-up comedy, you have to sit there for like a full minute each time and watch this video in your discord call, with all of you and your friends just sitting there, not laughing, whole audience in the recording, not laughing. And now you can go back to shooting and having fun and exploring and getting really cool guns.

This isn't f'cking skyrim, this isn't an actual RPG with a story and world I want to get invested in, same thing with BL3, no one cares about this stupid world, you are all hack writers and no one thinks this is clever except for 12 year olds. People do not want to play these games so they can watch an NPC talk to them for 5 minutes at a time, this isn't Mass Effect where the characters and world are fascinating and complex, this is a stupid reddit joke game that literally makes me sit and watch while they go ""ERM KIND OF AWKWARD""
The writing in this game is so much better than Borderlands 3, it's genuinely way funnier and I remember on my first character actually laughing sometimes which is extremely surprising, but really the point is that you shouldn't have such a pace-breaker in a multiplayer game, why are you making me and my friends sit around not laughing not having fun, when we were doing that just 5 minutes ago? Regardless of whether the dialogue is interesting, or funny, or has actual character, we don't want it in a multiplayer shlooter, we don't want to sit around waiting for the game to continue. To hammer in my point even further I wrote most of this while Zygaxis was talking to me in Brighthoof and all I could do was just wait for him to finish.

THERE IS NO REASON THAT ANY AND ALL DIALOGUE GIVEN BY NPCS CANNOT BE DONE VIA RADIO WHILE WE ARE SHOOTING THINGS
I hate to use all caps but that's really the only point I need to get across.

  Instead, what was delivered, was an EXTREMELY mediocre experience, one that feels 'unfinished'.

     In the Dragons Keep DLC, you are given an admittedly heart wrenching story behind the adventure about dealing with the loss of a loved one. The levels were well designed, the adventure was amazing, and the jokes were actually funny.

     Wonderlands fails in every single aspect. Everything feels restricted and unfinished. You don't even get a new game plus option, and the multiplayer fuck up from BL3 has carried over.  
    Now, as far as the hidden plot is concerned, I get it. Not every single story has to be an emotional experience that helps people heal/empathize with others. I get that. Not everything has to be a masterpiece like the Claptastic Voyage, that actually had the BALLS to address mental health issues.
    So I'm genuinely confused why Tiny Tina having a bitch fit and acting like a cunt was the 'big reveal'. If you're not going for an emotional journey because you know that your writing team can only make piles of excrement, shouldn't you instead switch gears and go for more of a 'good vibes' thing? Something high energy?   

    While you DO get to kill smurfs, explode the ocean, and the combat is admittedly really good, there is next to no replay- ability. The DLCs are all first class scams. Not at all what was promised. Short, linear tunnels to run and gun through in less than 10 minutes. There is no NewGame+ so you can forget about min-maxing and gear collecting, or having fun experimenting with story specific gear. 

   Do Not buy unless 80% off. Simply not worth the price.


     UPDATE:  I found a save editor that can give the illusion of NG+, or 'fake TVHM' as the creators dubbed it, effectively resetting all quests. I also found a mod that removes the weapons grade cringe that is the dialog. 
   Still doesn't fix the garbage multiplayer setup, and the fact that one would even have to take these measures is proof enough that that Wonderlands is doo doo. like poo emoji doo doo.",1707236923,1707257794,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The overall story is alright, but features mostly Tiny Tina being annoying as usual. The 2 ""sidekicks"" at the table make it more entertaining though, as they tend to mess things up in a sense of twisting the story. This comes to some unusual encounters with the Blue Hat Man and spontaneous combustion when saying the skin word.

What beefs up the game when the story is lacking is the combat. It's responsive, vaulting is back and you can shoot and cast spells at the same time. Spells are a huge difference in this game, as they are switched out instead of grenades. That said the spells has way more use than grenades, since I always recall grenades being lacking except for Transfusion grenades. Depending on class you select, then you specialize in these areas based on equipment and spells.

Slight downside to the game is the DLC. I would not recommend the full price on these and instead just grab the Season Pass during a sale. The problem is that the DLC are small ""Encounters"" being 4-5 rooms and an end boss. You can unluck up to 4 difficulties, but only the end boss becomes harder from that and not the rooms.

Like Ice-T, Penn and Teller, Vincent Price, the Smurphs, the Witcher (though it in no way compares to the Bioshock reference from Bordlands 1).

That being said, starting with Borderlands 3, Gearbox started leaning heavily on liberal cultural touchstones simply to pander to that audience.  Every romantic relationship does not have to be a gay relationship. 
 A weapon called ""The Cure"" who's weapon details include ""vaccines work, those are just facts"" isn't clever. 
 Having a whiny customer called ""Karen"" is lazy.  There's a character that isn't explicitly trans (it's just a female choosing to play as a male avatar), it's obvious the developers were going for trans pandering.

Despite the incredible flavor that Tiny Tina brings to the game and the surprisingly competent storytelling and antagonist this game has, it's all held down by shockingly lame content, both during the main story and in the end game.

Nothing about this game sticks me as memorable, besides a few key events during the main story which actually made me laugh out loud. As a Pre-Sequel type spinoff of the main franchise, I'm terrified of the direction Borderlands' future has in hold for us.

Gunplay is at its worst. Too many guns share the same gimmicks as every other weapon and you'll rarely find an actual gun, instead of a ""gun"" that shoots extremely slow, clunky projectiles or a beam that has astonishingly poor DPS. 

Spells instead of grenades is a cool thought, but the creativity just isn't there. Making spell rarities impact how they actually function seems like a good idea on paper, but this is Borderlands. Rarity means practically nothing unless it's Legendary or Pearlescent (the latter of which is not in the game, unfunnily enough). Rarities influencing how spells work can make some spells extremely powerful or extremely weak based on whether or not you get the blue or purple variant, which sucks; it adds another element to the loot table that makes grinding for weapons and spells just not fun.

Speaking of grinding, this game has hilariously bad post-game content. 
In Borderlands 2, you had Digistruct Peak, Invincible Bosses, and a LOT of bonus content via DLCs that that outvalue this entire game.
In Borderlands 3, you had Raids (I forgot what they're called but I can't be bothered to fact check), which, on their own, are probably some of the best content Borderlands has received as a franchise, and are COMPLETELY FREE. The DLCs also add a lot of content that is enjoyable, in terms of story and gameplay gimmicks.

This game's idea of post-content is a looping arena and free loot at the end based on how you perform. There's nothing else. Not even the DLC is even an inch as good as the DLC content from every other borderlands game.

Speaking of, this game's DLC, or ""post-launch content"", is LAUGHABLY TERRIBLE. They feature boring missions, boring storylines, and boring bosses. NONE OF THEM ARE WORTH TRIPLE THE ASKING PRICE OF BL2'S HEADHUNTER PACKS, WHICH INCLUDE NEW MAPS, NEW BOSSES, NEW ENEMIES, AND NEW LEGENDARY/UNIQUE LOOT.

ONE WONDERLANDS DLC IS WORTH LESS THAN A QUARTER OF A 5$ DLC FOR BORDERLANDS 2. 

I have no idea how Gearbox let this game flop so god damn hard, and who thought it was a good idea to launch the DLC for this game in such an astonishingly terrible and borderline unfinished state.

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is repetitive, shallow, bland, and ultimately - [b][u]miserably[/u] boring[/b].

If you're one to believe that [i]anything[/i] is fun together with friends, you have an opportunity to torpedo that notion for whatever cost this piece of shit retails at.

The genuinely infuriating thing to me is that this game does actually have elements of good-ness.
The world is beautifully crafted.
The voiceacting - great.
Writing? It's engaging, funny, even.
It does have the makings of fun gunplay under the hood.

But then after about 5 hours of playtime they murder all the good bits with horrible scaling, the game becoming brain numbingly easy and unchallenging. And not in a casual, chill-gaming, easygoing way...

There is nothing to adapt to, there is no threat. No thought process involved. It's not possible to die. It does not matter what build you build, what spells you use, what gun you choose - even on hardest difficulty all minions explode instantly, bosses are killed comically quickly. You just churn through a volume of mob HP, timegated by dialogue.

The RPG elements are a facade. Nothing you choose or do matters, you just run and blow stuff up, and its not even fun to ""blow stuff up"", because in comes lazyness, where the arenas become reused, pasted, making for a very repetitive and constant gameplay loop.

Whatever storyline there is, hard to appreciate it if you're yawning and zoning out due to the stale gameplay.

If I could, I'd refund, but the shallowness and unplayability of this garbage does not become apparent until well beyond 2 hours of gametime.

Using spells felt much less tactical and satisfying than throwing a grenade, the weapons all seem to have some weird projectile, nothing just shoots a straight bullet, and the enemies felt repetitive at times (many of them will be a skeleton of some sort). The shops and chests never seem to have anything good, and after saving up 50 items just to get a slight upgrade from the shop I felt scammed.

Also, most of what drops isn't guns, but wards and spells and stuff.  There is very little weapon variety and quality in this game.

Inventory management is the worst part of this game.  It seems impossible to organise your weapons in a way that makes sense, in terms of using or selling them.

Also, I wish they could have found a way to incorporate BL3's radioactive guns/element into this game.

I'll keep this brief as yeah, I do intend to complete the game but not in the sense I did former Borderlands titles by finding the best gear doing all the quests etc. This game is held up by its gameplay for me. If that wasn't fun, honestly I would have refunded it and tried to find a different game for my buddy and I to play. To put it simply, this game is pretty buggy, even moreso than any Borderlands title I've played in the past. They range from complete game crashes, graphical issues minor and major, sound issues minor and major, desync issues, a few of them requiring complete restarts after booting up the game. The gameplay is fun enough to be willing to tolerate these to a degree. Some of the other issues come with the maps design and the existence of certain invisible walls in places they really shouldn't be and some not being in places they should. The worst bug I found is in the magical bean quest area. There's a completely random spot on the map that if you ""superhero slide"" into it, you just die. The other part, I'm not one for politics in games, left or right unless it's a proper fit to the overall story and really is setting a deep tone of some kind or whatever the case may be. I will say seeing pronouns on the character creation screen had me a little leery and it was rightfully so. Now it isn't that they push themes too harshly or anything but it's just the writing in this game isn't flavorful or really all that good. The lack of wordplay for innuendo and overly crude humor just for the sake of it gets old really really fast. They just don't land, the characters aren't going to be memorable from this game. It's carried solely by Tina so far. If you just want the combat from Borderlands, it's here 100% and it's good.

This isn't it. The D&D based mechanics are fun and sparkly at first, and that alone kept me playing a lot longer than it should have. The emotion, the humor, the purpose, everything that made the DLC so special is spectacularly missing from this.

Everything in the game is filtered to be ""age appropriate"" for younger audiences, which effectively destroys almost everything that made Borderlands, well Borderlands, but also removes like 80% of Tina's personality. She's no longer the traumatized, deranged little maniac in a cute basket crumpets. She's just a normal, ""quirky"" teen girl. She's still cute, but everything that made her a precious bean that needed to be cared for (and provided therapy) is just gone. It's like taking OG Harley Quinn and turning her into an innocent chibi, still nice but not really special anymore.

Tina wasn't the only thing damaged by this either. The side quests are dull, combat is tedious to the point I just run straight through any unscripted fights now. The ""big baddies"" are waaayyy to easy to fight. The weapons are all the same [i] just in different font [/i], to the point that I don't think I've swapped anything in my loadout for at least 15 in-game hours. I hardly even pick anything off the ground anymore.

I tried so hard to love this game. Some of the mainline story is really cute and fun, and playing a character with 2 summons has been pretty neat (even if it's just the mechromancer with more fairy dust and friendship). Exploring the overlands could probably be considered a game in of itself. On a really good day, if I'm not thinking about it, I might tell you that this is the best game I've played in a couple years. That's just the Tina fangirl playing a game of denial though. The reality is if I stop to really think about my experience playing this game in comparison to the DLC that made me want it, everything just looks so lackluster and leaves me feeling mislead. 

I would still probably recommend this to preteens that want an entry to Borderlands, or maybe for people who don't particularly care about Tiny Tina and just want another Borderlands style game to occupy them for a while. For those who absolutely adored dragons keep or prefer the more traditional Borderlands experience though, don't bother. You're not the target audience. It's not worth the money.

- I bought the ""Chaotic Great Edition"" on sale for a bit over $21 and, so far, have played for 71.4 hours.  That's how long it took us to ""complete"" the main quest and all the side-quests (plus all the Challenge-type activities and non-grinding Achievements) of the core game.  So, on the plus side, the dollar-per-hour ratio is really good.
- The amount of work they put into the areas, scenery, animations, etc. is amazing.
- The action and general gameplay still maintains a Borderlands feel (with the D&D motif, of course).

On the negative side:

- The game is still woke, but nowhere near as badly woke as Borderlands 3 was.  It's almost tolerable.
- Many of the quest and the actions you have to complete to move through the game are just nasty.  Tina, as game master, does some really bad stuff.  Thinking it all over, in this game, Handsome Jack would have been right in calling us, the supposed heroes, bandits.
- The Overworld is just a pain.  I can understand why they wanted part of the game to look/act the way it does.  But, that doesn't make random encounters, awkward movement, inability to look up, and a general inability to gauge progress any more palatable.
- The inventory system is pretty bad.  Constantly wading through all those weapons with all their randomly named characteristics is just too difficult.  Heck, just figuring out what class of item something is is awkward.
- Similar to the inventory system, the leveling/class systems are a pain.  As if doing that for a single class isn't bad enough, they throw in a second class and then multiple different leveling system a bit later in the game.
- The major story areas, though beautiful, are so twisty-turny all-alike that you can't really figure out where you are, where you've been or where you're going.  Usually, that complexity is in all 3 dimensions, not just on a plane.
- The map desperately needs a fixed north-is-up mode.  Trying find things and explain locations to a co-op partner is almost impossible when the map can be in any orientation with no standard to reference.
- The main quest gives no real sense of progress.  It's almost entirely a case of being told to go here and do this, then go there and do that.  Again and again.  But, those tasks feel random and not like they're logical steps towards a goal.
- Even now, years after the game was released, there are a lot of annoying bugs.  Those should have all been squashed while the game was still an exclusive on Epic.

Overall, I'm going to rate the game as Not Recommended.  It's OK to play and its $/hr ratio is good.  But, its various faults just knocks me over to the negative side of a rating.",1705882618,1705935135,False,4,0,0.512490808963775635,0,True,False,False

At first I wasn't liking the gameplay as much as pretty much all the others. I've literally been playing 1, 2, the presequal, 3, then this basically back to back in order on the steam deck. This one I've started using Xreal Airs. 

That said at a certain point my equipment got better and I now am really enjoying gameplay and combat. At first it was like guns were very wobbly with no accuracy..gyro was sucking from when I was popping heads in the others. The over world takes a bit to get used to and start to open up areas.

Anyway the magic replaces your skill and grenades....and idk if it's my build but yeah. My magic slaughters everyone and my guns clean up the residue....I'm using Graveborn and Clawbringer skill trees with Dire Sacrifice skill. With basically Dexterity and Intelligence only being upgraded...slaughtering. it's nuts.

My really only gripe is idk if it's the game or what.  Is with the Xreal glasses the game doesn't let the resolution change from native steam deck resolution even if you change it in the OS. It's kind of weird. So you can't get the resolution right in the glasses which makes it slightly less than perfect.",1705812596,1705812596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

honestly i get what others say about the game being different but thats to be expected because ultimately it is different. I've also seen people complaining about the inventory, map and UI. Inventory is a simple fix come on you've play borderlands just get look for items you'll actually use and sell the rest literally spam the button to sell only after you've favorite the item of course. the map it is very different and there are parts that are really nice and others that are a little awkward the nice parts is being able to ""teleport"" to the fast travel points from where ever you are on the map which removes the need to run to the machines to sell your items and you just need to run back great time save honestly, awkward part for me at least is the dragging of the map is really wonky idk what part bout it is weird but the part i hate most is theres a sizable delay for dragging the map to look around the map like it doesnt move if you open and start dragging it a second later and you have to keep trying until it starts moving. as of the UI idk about the issues and i will edit this when i find more issues. but personally i find this game great theres quite a bit to do the looting is still as good as the other games.

TL:DR
issues: map has problems, inventory is a little messy and the game feels slower than the others of the franchise
good things: its the same game just with a different spin,its got the funny elements in the story the weirdness and all the good stuff
theres another issue i forgot but will add when i remember 
also get the game when on sale dont bother with full price the dlcs dont just dont pretty pointless
please comment and point out mistakes not like nitpick but point out things about the game i say. correct those.

After investing nearly sixty hours and earning all the trophies, here's my take on the game. The story, which is a parody of dungeons and dragons, is somewhat surface-level. The game play, while enjoyable, doesn't bring much innovation to the Borderlands series. On the highest difficulty, only a couple of moments required genuine strategy, mostly towards the end.

Trophy hunting was generally straightforward, except for unlocking all inventory upgrades, which became a tedious 10-hour grind of running around in circles opening chests. It is also worth noting that, acquiring all trophies requires purchasing the poorly received DLCs. 

Overall, I'd rate the game 7/10 for its entertaining game play. However, subpar DLCs and a grind-heavy trophy experience bring the score down to around 5.5/10. If you can snag it for $10 and enjoy Borderlands-style game play, it's worth a shot.",1705655609,1705655609,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They VERY easily could’ve created a True Fatemaker and Ultimate Fatemaker modes but elected not to. Instead we receive the Chaos Chamber, a 100 level battle arena of random enemies from the main story with in my opinion no incentive to complete and to me it’s just boring.

I beat the main story in less than 48 hours, but there are many things you can do afterward if you want to keep playing.

If you're not familiar with TTRPGs, the player/DM interactions, jokes, memes and overall culture, you might end up scratching your head most of the time and thinking: ""This is supposed to be fun?""

Besides D&D there are also many cultural references that go even as back as Don Quixote (by Miguel de Cervantes from early 17th century) or the mythos around King Arthur for example. These are mainly in sidequests which I personally liked a lot. The quality of side quests certainly motivated me to clear all side quests before proceeding with the many story.

Classes, builds, spells, guns... A LOT (and I mean a LOT) of variety there and you can find plenty of crazy builds online. The higher the level, the crazier things you'll likely find.

There is potential for Shift to sometimes not work I guess (it wasn't really working during the winter sale), if that happens use LAN through Hamachi.  If this is a dealbreaker for you don't buy this game until you look on the forums and don't see complaints about online being broken.   Get your group in the same Hamachi network.  Set game to LAN mode on the main menu, cog in upper-right.  Everyone but the one who wants to host goes to Social - LAN and joins the host.  After doing that, I've never had to wait more than 15 seconds on the ""Signing in..."" screen, and we've never been disconnected from each other.

You do need to connect to Shift to redeem codes, and redeeming codes sucks too.  Can't copy paste, have to type it in, then get this, you can't just hit enter to redeem, you don't just click redeem, no you have to click redeem and *then* hit enter.

Only other Borderlands I've beaten so far is 3 (though I've played a few hours of 2 a long time ago), I'm finding this one to be a lot of fun.

Took about 35 hours to complete the main game, all sidequests, and find all collectibles (we started using Map Genie about 30% into the game, having to backtrack to areas to finish completion for stuff we missed without it for about 4 areas).  There is still an endgame farm to do if we want, will see how much time we spend there.

I thought I recognized the voice but didn't look it up to confirm until the end - Will Arnett is the voice of Dragon Lord.

On my 3070, maxing everything @ 1080p had drops to low 50s only in a couple zones, so I just set FSR (no official DLSS) to quality and it was locked 60 everywhere.

You might want to turn off minimap rotation (which also makes the big map always face north when opening), it makes it a lot easier for communicating with people.

Not to mention the B2 DLC of Tina's Wonderlands (whatever it was called) and loved them. We were super excited to dive into another borderlands together. We were extremely disappointed. We talked about it and both decided to call it quits.
It is an endless mindless loop. The characters are boring and many sound like they are written by a group of children. 
I got this game on sale and I regretted it.

Below is a spoiler if you wanna see the last reason why a don't recommend this game. Its a little political.

[spoiler] The whole, Queen Butt-stallion jokes were...all the time. It got old way fast. (even in the Borderlands 2 DLC, they made the jokes, but not like this. This is extreme) There is a serious design choice towards the LGBTQQIAA+ community. Like, very much in your face. The first main character you meet is a trans-man. While they don't come right out and say it, its pretty obvious. The second side quest you do, is a slap happy humor about a woman who wants to profess her undying love to another woman so its a lesbian love story side quest. Its kinda stupid, but relatable in the quest steps. A normal ""she doesn't know who I am but I am in mad love with her"" kinda thing. But what really pissed me off is that normal love story, becomes the girl you have been working with decides she is in love with a polka doted mutant beast goblin, very much leaning into bestiality. Again they don't come right out and say it, but its pretty obvious what they are leaning into. The following quest was more guy loves animal. Slap stick and stupid to the max.
Articles have been written about this game and its ""Queer escapism and writing."" (literally that is the name of the title of an article)
The humor is very slap stick, juvenile (sometimes that's a good thing, but most the time it falls very flat) and lots of forced sexual preference kinda stuff, even if they done come right out and say it, its blunt in your face. I come to Tina's Wonderlands to play a game and mentally click off, not get told by some sexually deviant fantasy NPC in a monologue that all men are evil and F-the patriarchy kinda thing.

Look I am all for people doing their own thing, and a you do you mentality. But I hate it when people, left or right, force opinions and attitudes on you and expect you to just be ok with it without saying anything. Just shut up and drink the coolaid mentality. [/spoiler]

Gearbox and/or UE seems to be regressing:
- Non-rebindable keys in 2022? Come on.
- It's surprisingly hard to get the game to run fluidly without stutters.
- Needs more oomph from your hardware for essentially no visual benefit.
- UI doesn't support all resolutions, using a 16:10 monitor will prevent you from comparing items. Seriously, WTF? (Also no fix for this after 1.5 years?)
- To fix the UI issues, you have no sensible ingame display options and ini hacks don't really work.
- While most of the UI is as fluid as expected, ingame 3D UI (like hovering item details or quest markers) sucks really badly. It's unfathomably laggy/choppy, it doesn't keep up with your FPS I guess and is nailed to 30FPS.
- ...also the UI is really blurry (above 1080p I guess), so not really next-gen.
- Texture streaming is the worst I've ever seen, it takes literally ages for all textures to load and looks like a 1998 game along the way. From M2 SSD on highest streaming settings I might add...
- Managing inventory is somehow the most infuriating in the series.

For the game itself:
- It's borderlands, so it's solid, but nothing new.
- Setting is nice, it's like an expanded Tiny Tina D&D DLC - but that's it.
- Humor is ok, better than BL3, worse than BL2.
- Feels like a reskin, because it is.
- No NG+, you need to do repetitive challenges after the story (also alongside the story, mind you)

Over all, I think Gearbox has committed to resting on their laurels - there's no investment whatsoever in existing game systems, new systems aren't new but rehashed existing ones, the engine looks the same but gets increasingly demanding, UI is kinda fucked up for absolutely no reason, basic convenience is still missing after a decade.

BL games have been very samey for a long time, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. But since BL2 they seem to be on a slow downward spiral - I'm not sure what needs to be done, but something definitely has to be done.",1705067222,1705067222,False,2,0,0.523255825042724609,0,True,False,False

The game itself is a satirical take on DnD but done borderlands style. You get to customize your character from a bunch of diff ""roles"" and can customize your appearance and skills as well. The game is pretty much similar to borderlands, but instead of a free world to explore you have sequenced ""overworld"" area to explore which unlocks the more you explore the story. Combat is broken into instanced areas. There is no shortage of loot, so if you're a loot fiend like me you'll be entertained.

Where it falls a bit is how slow the combat is early on. Reloading takes forever, one full clip of ammo is just not enough to take down 1 enemy, and you just feel like you aren't doing much damage. This could also just be an issue because we started with the hardest difficult, but at the same time the challenge isn't really a challenge so much that everythings just a bullet sponge. That doesn't excuse how slow the combat and gunplay feels early on. Slowly it does get better, as with any borderlands game, but it takes a long time. At this time of review the gunplay and combat still feels slow, but I've watched my friends who are much further in the game and it looks way better. Lastly, there are a couple of bugs that are insanely annoying including multiplayer netcode issues and guns locking your camera randomly. Not sure why it happens so often, but you can drop your gun and re-pick it back up which fixes the locking camera problem.

If you can grind past the slow start and appreciate the game for being a DnD inspired looter shooter RPG style of game, then definitely grab it on sales. Mods exist to improve all the issues the game has.",1704974101,1704974101,True,0,0,0.393626987934112549,0,True,False,False

This one is superior to bl3 in charm and story, and equal i would say in gameplay on a moment by moment basis.  However, borderlands 3, while being the worst borderlands writing up to that point, had an excellent end game loop, along with tvhm and subsequent playthroughs. 
      I still recommend tiny tina's wonderland, but what the hell is wrong with the studio, that they would get this far with such a great game, and then completely blow the end game and replay loops? I think it was easier to just type in some code (spawn x amount of enemies, etc), use all the resources and procedural generation tools they already had, and call it a day. I'm specifically referring to the chaos chambers there, which is not included in the base game, but that is the only end game content there is. And you are stuck without progressing the character you used, and have to start with a new one to replay the game. 
      For context, i have a couple thousand hours in bl2, and hundreds of hours in bl3, and played at least one game with each character (i can't swear to that without looking, in the case of 3, but in bl2 i have multiples of each character). I have no problem restarting a borderlands game with a new character. After, usually, i have maxed out one character, usually. But also for a variety of other reasons. The point is, i have only played tiny tina's wonderlands about 1.5 times in all the time it's been out, and that is exclusively because i am so disappointed in the end game loop and lack of 'new game +' type mode (tvhm, uvhm).
      Seems to me, the franchise is given some love, but also plagued with money grubbing execs, woke politics (subjective, i realize), inexperienced and under talented writers (specifically bl3), and burn out or laziness, giving way to lazy procedurally generated end game content to avoid actually having to use play testers and balance for more levels (the skill trees would have to be added to, to avoid maxing out in a few more levels than currently exist). 
     All this being said, it's a very nice game with a fantastic aesthetic, a decent  and kind of charming (and pretty stupid at times, but it's a tiny tina game, what did you expect) story, with, of course, the best quality gameplay imaginable. It's worth it, and for me, even knowing the faults in advance, i still bought the dlc. I don't regret it, but it's just not that fun compared to what it should be, imo.

On the other hand, DnD, and although I'm not enough of a nerd to waste my time on role-playing games irl, nevertheless, I am well versed in this topic. TT games are cool, I don’t want to offend anyone, but the main reason is that I don’t like them because the Role-Playing Game can be disrupted, the atmosphere and the desire to continue are broken at this point and everything that happens begins to cause cringe and does not feel to continue.
I express my gratitude to the developers for all the efforts to create this game, BUT... With Tina, it turns out about the same as with DnD or any other tabletop role-playing game in my case. It was hard for me to be in the game and motivate myself to explore the world and develop my character. The main plot is absolutely not engaging and is boring to the point of insanity. The gameplay component has changed little within the series, however, the gameplay design leaves me with lots of questions. Weapons and abilities are as boring as it's possible, despite the abundance of tools. The opponents and battles are as monotonous as possible and begin to get boring after the first couple of hours. 80% of the time in the game is additional content without DLC, which is even worse than the main plot of the game. I don’t even want to talk about the endgame, because I don’t see the point in it, because...its presence in games of this series is already an ordinary tick, but in this case it’s just farming for the sake of farming, for the sake of nothing. Yes, this is a co-op game, perhaps someone will want to replay it with a friend and flex with items that have eaten up a lot of personal time that could have been spent more usefully. In general, it’s nonsense, but if it exists, then let it be, not the first time, but with even less meaning than before.
And it would seem that there is nothing left to add. Yes, this is still the same Borderlands and it will find its fans. Alas, I won’t be like that because due to a bunch of decisions and differences from the main series of this universe, it was simply hard for me to force myself to finish what I started. In my case, the game also turned out to be extremely unstable in terms of optimization and terrible connection within the context of co-op play. The only thing that could have been worse was in Outriders at launch, and even then, there I had no problems with the connection and I didn’t need to spend half an hour to finally play with my friend in this “masterpiece” and not crash on the next loading screen.",1704867556,1704867556,False,3,1,0.376681596040725708,0,True,False,False

My friends dropped Borderlands 3 due to lack of interest (whether its the story being crap or me going ahead with a different character is still left a mystery) but I still played through it for the occasional decent side missions and legacy characters, plus the gameplay being the best it ever been in Borderlands 3. I had hope that this recent game would be a step forward as the Borderlands 3 dlc was a massive improvement narratively, but I was wrong.

The distinct characters with their own personalities are gone now in exchange for your own custom character, so no use getting attached to them. The starting cast they present you with are so unserious they give off the vibes of a recent MCU movie, with no legacy characters to help counter it. Tiny Tina being the only one like that is fine but the entire cast not acting like freakin adults kills investment for me. It doesn't help the main villain is the same way and I swear he is either the VA or sounds like the VA for Bojack (Bojack Horseman) so I can't take the villain as a threat because I've heard that voice tied to a washed up alcoholic horse. It's baffling how the combination of DND and Borderlands feels more like a lazier Borderlands using the DND theme to justify cutting corners. The board game style open world to replace the large expanded maps feels half assed and leave the ""encounters"" to just be some horde mode style levels, paying to the lazingness of the the game.

Ok, I saved my biggest grip for last, the starting loadouts in terms of abilities for classes are straight ass, like watching your badass friend get cucked by his girlfriend into being a soy consuming killjoy. I wanted to pick the closest thing to a necromancer and all he does is an aoe attack?? that's my class ability?!?! They locked the companion that you have for later!?!?! What a load a shit.

In short, in the same way Starfield was undercut by the superior storytelling and RPG mechanics of Baldur's Gate 3, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands was completely undercut in the DND department by Baldur's Gate 3 and the FPS gameplay of previous Borderlands titles, like why the fuck would I want to play this game, that doesn't take itself seriously and cuts out all the RPG/dice rolling mechanics, over games that focuses on one aspect and polishes it to a shine?? 

There was a bunch of casuals demanding Baldur's Gate 3 would be better with real-time combat and honestly I can't see a game that would better appeal to that request, and as everyone else can predict, it sucks ass.

This game seems to be a PR checkbox for the LGB community though at many times it's so forced that it might also be a satirical comment on the current social situation. If you can look past all that crap (and for some that will be very hard as it's thick throughout), the game is fairly decent.

The game is alright but both the antagonists and protagonist are meh, the narrators are annoying (Tiny Tina is ok though, I meant the other two) and the story is just fine at best. The bosses are too easy and simple and the “random encounters” are repetitive and thoroughly boring. Those random encounters are used everywhere in the game to the point where I just can’t tolerate them anymore. E.g. they are used in Pokémon styled random encounters, in multi-leveled dungeons, in camps you have to beat, as trail runs (in which they are even longer), as side-quests and a few more places that I can’t remember right now.

The gameplay is nice though, they added some interesting classes and abilities. Instead of grenades you have spells with interesting effects that can be really powerful. The gunplay feels just like what you would expect from Borderlands: solid and varied. There are enough weapons that you’ll always find something you like. The DnD theme was fun to return to and the changes they made to accommodate that were really good.

The humor is still mostly there but it has become very careful and dulled down. They watered down the more brutal feel of the older games into a more [insert current year] game. It has some occasional good moments and partially beats the whole influencer/streamer nonsense they had in BL3 to some extent. Emphasis on the “partially” part, the rest of BL3 is still better.

The UI (menus, inventory management, etc.) have been worsened even more than BL3 already did. You can’t even compare items properly because they stick outside of the screen. There were a lot of small annoyances in this area but I can’t remember them all right now and got used to some of them eventually.

Towards the end of the game, they don’t give you enough money to upgrade everything like they did in other Borderland games which made it really annoying to get the final achievement. Me and my friend ended up spending a good 20 hours just grinding the trail runs until we found an exploit that involved hitting dead sharks with a pickaxe for 20 minutes per shark. We did that for 6-9 hours until we found a duplication glitch to get the final 200 million dollars we needed. This process really killed the game for me. Of course, I know it’s optional but the other games made the money system way more reasonable and all these small annoyances add up. I think it might be this way because the game is much shorter and has a much lower level cap while they never bothered adjusting the pricing to compensate. In the previous games getting all the achievements were a lot more fun, even running around aimlessly searching for red-chests in BL2 was more fun than this.

I was looking forward to this game as the BL2 DLC that inspired this game was amazing. I really wanted to like it but it ended up being somewhat of a disappointment for me. It’s alright, not bad, but not as good as what I expected from a BL game. There are just too many small bad things that add up to a “meh” overall experience. I recommend it assuming you have played the other Borderlands games first and that the game is on sale, otherwise no.

So much forced humor into a game that it really turns something off in my brain. 

The most interesting thing about this game is the swords which are VERY fleshed out, tons of different types of swords with interesting options. I really wish Borderlands had this in the next game. The spells are very neat besides finding the same damn legendary spell in one play-through.

Main gripes:

- Repetitive Mobbing, far beyond what other BL games have had.
- Voicing: Characters say their quips far too often (Similar issue in BL3)
- Leveling/NG+: No real incentive to continue playing after reaching level cap and finishing the story. The Chaos dungeons are interesting as a concept but really unless we get a level cap increase and DLC there's very little replayability.

Action zones are small and don't feature many points of interest or things to find. Fights are primarily delivered through an encounter system where there is nothing to discover in the environment and the objective is simply to defeat a certain number of enemies and advance to the next wave. Collectibles are remarkably easy to find, leaving very little to discover after the game is beaten and a handful of unremarkable stat-boosting rewards is all you will have to show for it. DLC is woefully uninteresting and fails to complement the main story in any meaningful way, managing to be forgettable both in and out of story context. Chaos Mode, the ostensible post-game content, is literally ""get boned by RNG: the game mode"". Think mayhem modifiers, but without the choices and with a bunch of new ways to suddenly and inexplicably die in the name of marginally superior loot. All the fun of exploring broken builds is nerfed into the ground by the sad 40-level cap, lackluster gear modifiers, and meager skill trees. Legendary weapons and spells feel phoned in and the armor system seems tacked on to fill a hole. Loot is wholly unrewarding to farm and the process is sometimes excruciatingly bad, with astronomically low drop rates combined with Chaos requirements that make the experience unpleasantly unforgiving. Even the most successful loot farm yields a disappointingly small improvement in firepower while the enemies grow exponentially in difficulty with Chaos enabled. There is no equivalent to TVHM, which means no second playthrough, which means you will hit level cap before you beat the final boss. But hey, you get a bunch of new Tina lines and Torgue finally gets to blow up the ocean.

Final ratings:

Graphics 5/5 - It's a stellar look for the franchise, but the environments are bland and repetitive
Sound 4/5 - Decent enough, but there is a LOT of waiting on audio dialog, with punchlines that often fall flat
Gameplay 3/5 - Borderlands gunplay, without the awesome effects or OP interactions, but with melee weapons
Storyline 2/5 - We knew it would be about Tina's psychosis, but the delivery is distilled cringe and even Torgue can't save it

Overall 3/5 - If you're desperate for more Borderlands, you can give it a try. There won't be as many dick jokes and it is much shorter than BL3, but all the pieces are there.",1704616048,1704616048,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I have been plagued with issues since trying to boot the game. It started with the game getting stuck on the signing in page. Putting steam into offline mode allowed me to get past that screen and accept agreements then i was able to boot the game while online. 

the much larger issue. Audio is absolutely F****d. I think ive spent about 2 hours trying to trouble shoot the audio but nothing i do has any affect. Id say a conservative estimate would be that 70% of the dialogue is not present in my game. The subtitles show up thankfully, but most of the voice acting is just missing or requires my avatars ear to be pointed to the person talking. and the ear must be pointed at them to hear anything. I have no spatial audio settings enabled. spatial audio is not turning on in the background, i cant figure this sh*t out and its driving me crazy cause this game is fun.

Wonderlands is a fun and beautiful addition to the Borderlands games. HOWEVER It lends to a wonderful play through with little in the way of end game.

If this title had done similar to other titles in the franchise with a new game plus, or better, it would not have suffered as much come end game. If you are going to purchase this game, get it on sale along with the DLC. Buying the DLC separately really isn't worth it.

Realm dungeons, there is so much content in total.
However, there are a few moments of highlight (shock) in the plot, but that's all
Compared with the 3rd generation, although there are more than ten or twenty maps, they are all very small, and they can be run away at will, and the previous generations can have vehicles. Collect a lot of elements, stoppers, scrolls, puzzles, obelicias.
The content of the game can be said to be significantly reduced in history.
Among them, the game's career system is also a highlight, with six classes.
It's just a bit of a hassle. There are six equipment slots (necklaces, armor, magic books, etc.) and melee weapons slots, and four traditional shooting weapon slots. There are more things to brush. After level 40, the legend is opened, but instead of leveling up, extra points are given to upgrade additional skill trees.

So I was really excited when I learned they were making a standalone game in the same style.

But when I started playing the game I was fairly disappointed, because the game is PG16 rated, there is no gore, blood and profanity. At first I thought the profanity filter was on because they censored some words very strangely, but after a quick search I found out there was not profanity or gore in the whole game. I thought this was a big mistake because one of the reasons I really liked the story of the borderlands games was, it was very brutal and sarcastic.

For the technical side of the game, they improved the in game menus and especially how to use your inventory. The hitboxes of some of the objects are very annoying when using the sniper, like some wooden gates have a hitbox a feet above where the wood ends which is very annoying when taking cover behind them and peeking out to shoot your enemies and then finding out you were just hitting the fence on places where there is not actual fence. There are also a lot of bugs with pathfinding during story parts where the npc just gets stuck behind objects. One other thing I also found really annoying is, every time you start the game, it's recalculating the shaders, and it just takes too long.

Getting to the story, it's just mid. I like the conversations between the party members and the whole DnD aspects, but the rest of the story didn't do it for me. It didn't make me have any desires to get to the endgame.

For getting to let the player know the controls, items and the world, they could've done a better job. I took me ages to find out that wards are shields, but there is also a specific group of shields that are called ward. Quickly comparing items that are on the ground is not as intuitive as the previous games.

I would not recommend playing this game if you think it would be a borderlands 2 experience. If you never played a borderlands game and you can get this game for 10 bucks, maybe it's worth the money.

For now I would rate it 6/10",1704548918,1704548918,False,39,2,0.649997472763061523,0,True,False,False

Some people feel like it's repetitive, and if you're expecting something else from a borderlands game, i don't know what to tell you. They all are. This one just admits it and leans into it.

- Game feels soft-boiled, goal to reach USK16 rating is very perceptible
- Random encounters and ""dungeons"" are all the same varying only in tileset and enemy type (based on tileset)
- DLCs add just fights with a new boss each and some items

There is a mod that lets you skip dialogue by button press like in many other games. Skipping every dialog of Tina, the Robot and Valentine (the Narrators) and most of the quest dialogue made the game playable for me.

The problem is mobbing. In earlier Borderlands games, arenas were just little side things to play with; here, they're a necessity for a LOT of the content. Any area that's a ""Combat Encounter"" (like any random encounter, Overworld sidequest dungeon, most shrine piece dungeons) drops you in a large zone, but all the mobs that spawn immediately know where you are.

This means if you are a methodical, strategic killer, like a sneaking or sniper sort, you're going to hate this, AND you're going to see and make use of almost NONE of the zone architecture you've been dropped into. All the interesting zone complexity is lost, and you'll have to run around like mad or risk getting cornered by masses of mobs homing in on you.

The worst part? This is the entire design of the post-game content. It's ALL mass mobbing in these kinds of zones and fights. No wandering, no exploring, no planning out how to take down individual groups, just run and gun and masses of mobs homing in on you and that's it. No style. No strategy. VERY limited build options that lean more and more heavily on specific pieces of equipment with specific enchants.

It's all a loss. After Borderlands 3's mediocre experience, I was hoping for something. Desperately mass mobbing ALL the time is NOT fun.

Edit: Went back in to try the DLCs. I tried the third one, with Fyodor and the chains, and got infinitely swarmed while trying to stay on a pressure plate to break a chain. Constant downs, fast death. I don't see a way to do this, and, again... mobbing SUCKS.

On top of that, I forgot to mention that the game is riddled with little bugs, like Quick Travel randomly not working unless you quit out and reload, and equipped gear textures randomly not loading, often until you do the same. Select button randomly not opening the subscreen.

Also the game is LOADED with ""small"" but strong mobs that beat the crap out of you and quickly run around you, so you're constantly trying to figure out what's hitting you as your shield and health jump down in chunks, looking down and in circles in the middle of a mob of other enemies that are also trying to kill you.

I just have zero love for this game. The first Borderlands game I can honestly say that about. The post-game is miserable.",1704357786,1704429587,False,12,2,0.584483802318572998,0,True,False,False

While Borderlands 2 had its merits and Tiny Tina was a crucial character, this version of her in the new game seems more like a nostalgic ploy to attract buyers, leveraging her as a brand.

In terms of voice acting, Wanda Sykes as Frette adds a fun element to the dialogue, and Andy Samberg's portrayal of Captain Valentine, though different from his usual comedic style, blends well with Sykes' character. Familiar voices might be a draw for those interested in this aspect of gaming.

Regarding the story, it didn't particularly captivate or disinterest me; it fell somewhere in the middle. The voice acting kept things entertaining, but the distinct Borderlands vibe seemed lacking, almost as if the game took cues from a less engaging RPG source.

The feel of an open-world characteristic of Borderlands is notably absent. Encounters and skirmishes occur differently, neither impressively nor disappointingly, just averagely.

Starting on the Insane difficulty level, known for its challenge, I found it surprisingly easy. Even when deliberately using lower-level gear and pacing encounters, the difficulty level didn't match up to previous Borderlands games.

Graphically, it maintains the familiar Borderlands style. The enemy designs are well-crafted, and the landscapes are meticulously drawn.

While there are aspects I appreciate in the mechanics and structure, there's more that I find less appealing. Purchasing it on sale for $19.99 felt like a reasonable price for what essentially felt like a basic game.

Ultimately, if you're seeking an experience akin to Borderlands, sticking with Borderlands 3 might be more satisfying. For franchise collectors, a sale purchase might be worthwhile. Those who appreciate strong storytelling and character investment might not find this game fulfilling in those aspects.

This title is a spinoff from the mainline Borderlands games series and features a fully cooperative online campaign. The review will focus on the base campaign experience played entirely in 4-player coop. [/u]

[h3] TL;DR – Re-skinned Borderlands 3 which is not necessarily a good thing as the good doesn’t improve while the bad only feels more dated and problematic now. [/h3]

Story (2/5) – Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is set in “Bunkers & Badasses” a fantasy roleplaying tabletop game in the same vein as D&D that is created and game-mastered by the titular Tiny Tina. Just like the prior Borderlands title, the story is wacky and often at times makes little to no sense. The same is true in Wonderlands only with poorer writing, pacing and general cohesiveness. Tack on the fact that NPCs are always trying to offer you side-quests and following the story can be rather tough and unrewarding. While the same atmosphere worked in the mainline games, it just falls rather flat in Wonderlands.

Gameplay (4/5) – Gunplay remains to be a strong suit of the Borderlands games with all the usual gun manufacturers present. There are whole new classes to fit the fantasy world’s archetypes. The addition of “magic” is an interesting gameplay element, but don’t differ too much from the active skills from the base games. Hybrid classes now exist, but do not matter significantly in the base campaign. 

Controls (4/5) – Played on a mouse and keyboard, Wonderlands felt exactly like playing any other Borderlands title. Fully customizable button layouts are present. Shooting is nice and snappy. While movement is almost identical to Borderlands 3’s which does start to feel a touch dated at this point.

Graphics (3/5) – Borderland’s cel-shaded look is back with Wonderlands and it very much looks like a re-skinned version of Borderlands 3 albeit running much poorer. I liked the artwork and art style for Borderlands 3’s space faring setting, but it doesn’t quite work for the fantasy setting of Wonderlands. Moreover, enemy recognition is also rather tricky as their colour pallet means they often just blur into the background. 

Audio (2/5) – By far the weakest link in Wonderlands, the audio in this game leaves a lot to be desired. The soundtrack is repetitive and forgettable. A lot of audio bites are reused and recycled from the previous games. And the voice acting falls rather flat despite having some rather high-profile voice actors, it was almost as if they were all in different venues recording their lines. 

Issues/Optimization – Wonderlands doesn’t run very well on PC I’m afraid. Despite tweaks and usage of FSR, I had to lock the game to 75 fps due to the large number of frame rate drops and very inconsistent frame pacing. Fortunately, crashes and gameplay bugs were non-existent. 

Overall (3/5) – Having thoroughly enjoyed Borderlands 3, I had high hopes for Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands. While there were certainly moments of fun and laughter in my ~22 hours play through of the base campaign, I never found myself returning to the game to finish its many more side quests left waiting. If you’re new to the Borderlands series, I probably wouldn’t recommend starting here.

I have to say its the same mixed feeling I had for bl3. Same issues aswell. Gameplay and Graphics were awesome, I kept getting the same Borderlands vibe. But then came the issues, with all the 1st world Country problem Dialogs, way too many Sexual dialogs. In all do respect though, it is not as bad as bl3 but you still that cringe vibe from time to time.
there were sometimes where It really got uneasy, when Tina was talking how she and Moxxi had a something going on...Moxxi is like a 35-40 year old milf while Tina is a 13 year old teen, Im not sure how that got even got aknowledged to be in the game.
 Beginning however fantastic, first 3-4 hours was the true borderlands experience, had alot of fun. The story itself was unique and enjoyed playing it through aslong as the dialog wasnt cringe.

There are also some bugs I have encountered, I have completed every side quest yet I havent unlocked the achievment for it. I assume its bugged because, when I opened the map I had 15 quest options from 1 Region, but there is only 4 to do in that region, and no other NPC had a quest to give me. So that needs to be checked out.

On another negative note, the game felt too easy. You definitly become overequipped with all the loot given to you. I havent tried out the endgame yet, only once but I havent really noticed any difference.

Bossfights, were also enjoyable. the way they made themselves appear was really cool, but fighting them was not fun since again, you almost insta kill them.

[h1]There's nothing new[/h1]
It's basically a reskin of Borderlands 2. Guns are the same, shooting is the same, skills are the same, enemies are even dumber. You would think that since Borderlands was set in a completely new setting, the developers would reinvent the core gameplay mechanics and give players something new to play, but nah.
TTWL is a giant satire of the entire D&D universe and CRPG genre. The developers could dig a little deeper into that shit and, while looking for the stuff to laugh at, take some points on the mechanics that would make the game feel fresh and new. A feeling I haven't had since Borderlands 2. But all I got is a stat system, which is plain and blank as it could be, and a new weapon type — crossbows. Which sucks.

[h1]Narrative Cringefest[/h1]
I never really liked Tiny Tina as a character. Her personality didn't catch me, I didn't care about her lines and her story. And that might be the reason why the whole narration of this game feels boring, forced and cringeworthy. Every time the narrator tells a joke, a ""how do you do fellow kids"" meme pops up in my head, and I cringe. In their attempt to laugh at D&D boomers, the writers have become those very boomers, just on the other side of the fence. 

[h1]Just another game in the series[/h1]
Overall, the game feels lazy and talentless. The whole series of the last decade feels stagnant. There is little to no change from game to game. And TTWL is no exception.

The first Borderlands game was something new. A satirical shooter with a pretty interesting universe and a fresh look at shooter mechanics. They basically invented/popularized the looter shooter.
Borderlands 2 polished all of that and doubled the concentration of weapons and jokes and balanced them perfectly.

Since then, we've had a 5th game in a Borderlands series, and they haven't strayed far from the Borderlands 2 formula. Some might say that's a good thing, but personally I've had enough.

Shooting the same enemies with the same guns while listening to all the same recycled jokes for God knows how long since Borderlands 2 in a row is a bit much.  I expected some depth in the new setting: both, gameplay- and narrative-wise. And if you are like me, I strongly suggest you to skip this one.",1704108641,1704108856,False,5,0,0.540069699287414551,0,True,False,False

I bought it at full price and it was such a mistake; less than 30 hours of gameplay, and DLCs are comprised of waves of boring enemies with no story, that can be completed within 10 minutes max (ALL OF THEM COMBINED).

I'm still happy I went through with the purchase because it gave me more experiences of the Borderlands series, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's not a die-hard fan of BL, especially at full price. Buy it only when on high discounts and skip the DLCs, they're just a scam.

Also - I understand Gearbox's motive for advocating for LGBTQ rights and ""normalizing"" their orientation, but it's so forced at this point that I just feel like I'm being brainwashed and indoctrinated into believing that it is the NORM, when it's just *so* not (mainly referencing the knight with the beard who's also supposed to be a girl apparently...?).

Buy heavily discounted, be aware DLC is worthless.

The gameplay itself is mechanically solid (same as in BL3), map design is much better than BL3 IMHO, however it suffers from many of the same flaws as BL3. There are too many status attacks, there is too much loot to the point it becomes both meaningless and a chore as 99% is junk, as a word of advice ignore anything white and green, not worth the time or in-game money. There so much stuff going on in the screen all at once that you get killed dozens of times and have no clue what is that killed you. You will die many times right after a level has been cleared or a boss defeated because you will step in a pool of some goo that in a second will eat your shield and your health, doesn't matter how high they are.

As with every borderlands game one gun category is rendered useless this time around is shotguns, save the ones that fire bombs or swords 99% are useless. I finished the game just using smgs, pistols and assault rifles, bazookas, snipers and as mentioned shotguns are useless. The loot, there is so much of it that is rendered irrelevant, you find a decent gun level 20 and you can carry it to level 30 discarding 1000 guns in the way, eventually you need to replace it because it becomes a peashooter, when you replace it you won't replace it with a better gun, just whatever you find that can make a dent in the enemy's health just because it is a higher level weapon. All the enchantments and status effects, hero trees, etc, all amount to a huge mess that becomes bothersome quickly, I couldn't bother to look at it proper.

The sound effects are decent, the music is non-existent, is elevator quality at best.

It is a 25/30h mid game buy only heavily discounted. I'm not excited for more Borderlands games anymore, it is clear Gearbox doesn't understand what made BL1 and BL2 fun to play.",1704025405,1704025405,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

TTW is an example of a realistic digital soul-numbing experience that I was NOT ready for.
I'm no stranger to Borderlands, having about 280 hours in Borderlands 2, but this game is on another level of soulless. If you like Borderlands 3 then you might like this but then again, [u]you like Borderlands 3[/u].

Terrible writing. The game has no stakes, peaks or troughs, excitement, enjoyable characters. Every line uttered is so sickly interwoven with forced humour and bland jokes that nothing can be taken seriously so you end up just gritting your teeth and pushing through mandatory, dry dialogue, waiting for the next objective to open up. This is my main gripe, bar-none. To have a story with no story is quite a feat.

The gun-play is fine, the spells are interesting and fun, the abilities are mediocre at best (from what few I've played with). Weapon identity is vapid and robotic - whilst the guns look good for the most part, the randomly chosen attachments and mods make most guns look abysmal or indistinguishable aside minor adjustments ( switching a 2-shot burst gun to 3-shot burst? so boring, man). Stat-wise, the game feels less like a game about looting cool guns to a game about finding high percentages and scores. Just use the guns with higher scores. Also the difficulty plays a part in the monotony - I don't feel anything when I defeat a boss 5 seconds after it was hyped up as a really super dangerous bad guy. The graveborn pulse ability just becomes an instakill screenwipe after some time and since the enemies scale to your level you'll never see that change.

The bugs were plentiful and somehow STILL present after all this time. Inability to reload on an empty mag, completely unusable minigun/overheat weapons (I played co-op with a friend hosting), ragdolls bugging out hardcore, janky mantle hitboxes, occasional crashes and missing HUD features. I'm most peeved about the minigun bug like I couldn't use that whole category of weapon because they just didn't work, like huh?????

Above all, this is just such a boring game. Sure, it's flashy, but there's just no substance to anything. I'd catch myself slumped over forgetting to blink due to the monotony. Another thing I just remembered is that the weapons just don't have ANY impact - snipers lack any proper recoil and most guns lack powerful-sounding effects. Feels like you're shooting marshmallows.

As much as I'd like to think that the game gets better, to delude myself further would call for me to be checked into a psychiatric ward. They say the sick delude themselves - perhaps this is the game's doing.

There are guns in Borderlands 1 that straight-up feel better. Graphics are good, but most NPC models have bad graphics (360/PS3 era). I personally liked the aspect of battling in arenas but 90% of the time you fight in them, making it feel monotone. Freshly introduced characters barely get any dialogue after their first appearance. Monster designs are extremely repetitive.

Then again, I liked some of the music. Sound design is alright. Dialogue is at least 90% pure filler/redundancy. Loot chance is determined by dices you NEED to find first. After the main story, you can do shadow chambers, and you are going to spawn in re-used arenas again and again. I then did some runs and mostly had legendary/epic gear on my level and attempted chaos level 2 and got instantly oneshot by enemies on normal (not elite). I'm just going to tell you, the min-maxing that needs to be done is not worth it for this game. Once you're done-- There's nothing really new. 

I found Borderlands 3 to have redeeming features, but Tiny Tina's Wonderlands becomes really bad and boring really fast. This game appears good once you learn they crafted it in a year while being stuck in home offices, but couldn't they just improve it now?

After playing the standalone Assault on Dragon Keep DLC for Borderlands 2 I had caught the bug and Tiny Tina´s Wonderlands is everything I would wish for in a full blown game version of the DLC and more.
 After so many people were disappointed with Borderlands 3 this is a definite return to form in terms of humor, storytelling and just overall gameplay fun. They took the good innovations from 3 and packaged it in a very charming and character driven game with a lot of nerdy humor and jokes that every DnD player will instantly recognize. Throw to that a lot of funny references, great comedic voice acting and beautiful environments and you are sure to have a good time.
Also you finally get to Blow up the Ocean!
Gameplay and gunplay feel very smooth and rewarding with a lot of ways and options to design your character and what kind of build you want. With the weapons and spells, which replace grenades, being so ubiquitous and varied every new weapon box or beaten elite enemy can give you something that will influence your combat and raw power. You also feel very mobile and fast on your feet which adds to the rush of the game.
Technically it is pretty solid and in around 50 gameplay hours I only had one hard crash and a handful of bugs and glitches, mostly connected to things on the screen not going away when they should but that is usually solved with a quick restart or similar.

One thing that was irritating besides some of the typical grinding (ok I get it, there is grinding because it's Borderlands) and game-play wonkiness is that the game has its fair share of bugs like falling out of the combat level to respawning into insta-killed by some environment border.

Then I started realizing all the fights are the same, waves of enemies ending with a badass or some other more difficult to kill enemy type and then it's over. Also there were so many of the same enemies! After that realization it's rough to play the game because the foresight of having to battle another wave of orcs/skeletons/crabs is just not that fun. 

In other Borderlands games I thought this was done way better or at least not as noticeable. Granted I did play BL3 with friends and never solo so maybe 'same enemy fatigue' would set in there as well if I had.

Tina is my favorite character since she made her appearance and it's awesome seeing this feral character grow.  And as you can expect her storytelling for a roleplaying game is fantastic!

The multiclassing is great, the chaos chambers is actually refreshing.  I finally don't have to hate going back into previous zones.  The chaos chambers are arena runs that are altered by buffs, debuffs, and purchased buffs.  The less purchased buffs you buy, the more RNG you get for gear at the end of the runs.  And the gear chance goes up with chaos levels to spawn Chaotic, Volatile, Primordial, and Ascended ranks of gear.  I think you will be done with the game quicker than most in the series.  But it really does feel better for multiplayer than it used to.

Finding all of the lucky dice, marbles, poetry pages, scrolls and whatnot to maximize your bonuses for the chaos chamber grind can be tough, but it is more fun than looking for those vault logos.

Cons:
I will say that end game is definitely more focused on the elements than previous borderlands games.  I feel like there are too many mixes and layers of resistances in these arenas.  So it can be pretty overwhelming with constantly switching weapons to mow through all of the layers the adds throw at you.  The characters definitely need some damage penetration because you can't focus a damage type like you used to.  Like if I stacked a ton of frost damage it will still lower shield damage, just not as fast.  Well in this game, it starts to feel more like cutting through a brick wall with a plastic spoon than it did in previous games.

Conclusion:
If you liked the borderlands games, but didn't like going through the entire game twice doing normal and then bad a** difficulty to get the better gear, than this one will be more appealing.

One of the biggest wastes of money in gaming that I've spent in many years. It's barely tolerable and I was glad to be done with it after I beat it. Basically it's just the equivalent of a big DLC content for BL2. I can really only stand to play it an hour or so at a time. Just more Borderlands although it's a hell of a lot better than the unoptimized stuttery mess cringe-fest that BL3 was, although this is still pretty damn cringe. I don't think I've ever seen a game this woke. It of course opens up like past games with a baby saying ""Gearbox!"" but as usual it sounds like ""Geeewbawx!"" cuz it's a baby saying it. Good choice. The first npc of importance I come across is a knight named Mike, but it's actually a girl and she wears armor with rainbows and unicorns painted on it. On a side-quest, a farmer girl tries to get me to help hook her up with another chick for a lesbian relationship. Wanda Sykes does the voice of one of the main npc characters. For those that don't know who she is, and trust me you aren't missing out because she isn't funny she just flat out sucks, she is a LGBTQ black gay female comic married to another woman. They decided it would be a good idea to get another massive woke liberal comedian, Andy Samburg, to do one of the other main voices. You soon come across a big buff guy named ""Punchfather"" who wears fairy wings, and on and on with the woke BS. This is the most shining example of woke gaming that I've ever seen.

--- The worst Borderlands DLCs BY A LONG SHOT
-- 95% loot is utterly useless and only for selling
-- Second ring + enchantment after campaign?
-- Very boring and useless end game
- Random deaths, after all enemies are dead(?)

The campaign of this game is pretty good and was overall a lot of fun, the maps are beautiful and large, the gameplay is very fun and the game makes the most out of its unique setting. The overworld map is pretty unique, there are a lot of character- and build options and the bigger quests are all around interesting.
But all is not well: there are some BAFFLING choices made by the developers starting with the DLCs, which are completely worthless and WAY overpriced at 10€ a piece, locking a class behind a paywall as well. Another thing I hated, was that loot is completely useless in 95% of cases, which is a shitty feeling in a LOOT SHOOTER! I stopped picking up anything in the final levels as I simply got tired of picking up trash and selling it. Speaking of final levels: the second ring slot and enchantments, which are a pretty big factor in builds in my opinion, are unlocked after the story...... 
Most likely for the mindless and extremely boring Chaos Chamber grind, (guess where all the good loot went, lol). Why the F U C K is such a big priority put on the end game? As if the numerous random encounters during the story weren't boring enough, the end game consists of such ""encounters"" exclusively. Or replay some bosses... and for what exactly?!? 
Why should I even grind this stuff? WHAT FOR??? Honest question!
I finished the story. Why would I WASTE my time with this repetitive, boring endgame, which has nothing new to offer?
My recommendation? Get the base game (wait for a sale) and steer clear of the DLCs. I got the Chaotic Great Editon mostly for the new class during Summer Sale for 26,40€ and I still feel absolutely robbed by the DLCs...",1689085889,1702081334,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a spin-off of the Borderlands series. The last game i played from this franchise was actually Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep DLC. Wonderlands brings players back by offering an alternate version of D&D called Bunkers and Badasses. Right from the start, I noticed a lot of nice references to games like The Witcher 3, Path of Exile, Curse of Monkey Island, and of course the older Borderlands games.

The story is really nice. Your main quest is to defeat the evil Dragon Lord and save the fantasy world rules by a unicorn called buttstalion, the game is a continuation of the 2013 DLC. I won't spoil much but it was interesting enough to keep me wondering how it's going to end. The game also has some really high quality side quests that blend seamlessly with the main storylines. The humor and dialogue were lighthearted and kept me engaged without any character wearing out their welcome. In fact, I actually wanted to see more of Tiny Tina. 

Gameplay-wise, the fantasy setting brings welcome new ideas like spellcasting instead of just throwing grenades. Every spell type gives you unique options to experiment with. The weapons felt great and had top notch animations, overall the combat was thrilling and stands out as some of the most fun I've had in recent FPS titles. The overworld was a welcome addition as it really provides a spice of variety when taking a break from chaotic dungeon runs. I can only imagine how much better the experience would be playing coop with a friend.

Last but not least, on the visual and performance side, the game looks great. It has that timeless Borderlands art style that is sure to age gracefully. The game didn't have any FPS drops although I had to cap the fps at 50

The story is bland (which is to be expected) the characters boring, the overall gameloop is literally do the same thing over and over again, the ""dungeons"" are the exact SAME even tho I entered a dungeon that was in the OTHER corner of the map like c'mon even if these are ""RNG"" at the very least care to put certain dungeon's layout in certain places and keep 'm there.

I tho that unlocking the 2ndary class would make the game somewhat more ""fun"" to play but it didn't did much and the final nail in the coffin are the weapons, all of 'm feel so underpowered while on BL3 even a green weapon can do some dmg but here even legendaries do next to nothing in some enemies.

I was pushing myself to play the game hoping at the least I would enjoy the first playthrough (knowing the end game is s#!t from what I've was told) but I rather play something I like there's really no reason for me to go through this.

I hate when the final boss randomly appears and disappears. They did this in BL3 with the twins also. It feels like lazy writing. The world does not feel like BL at all. Yeah sure the characters have black outlines but that's it. I feel like the designs are boring. The eyes of the NPCs are f.ing creepy. The colors are all over the place. I hate the ""tabletop"" world with the chibi figurines. Interrupts the flow of the game. I just start to enjoy the shooter looter aspect of it and then baaaammm I am thrown out from the fantasy and need to play chipi pokemon and avoid grass at all cost. 

The map doesn't work as it should. There is plenty of time passed since release of the game and they cant fix it? The map was great in BL2 and now it is useless. The blue quest marker only shows up when I am literally at the place. I need to place a custom marker everywhere I go. So f.ing annoying.  

Also I do not care about the characters. I would have liked if Tina was playing with Moxxie and Ellie to help them move on from the death of Scooter, because D&D helped Tina to get over Roland's death, but no. We are introduced to 2 completely new characters who I don't even like. The have boring designs and not much of a personality. I would have loooved if we are not a newbie to the group but to the D&D world. Maybe we could have been playing as Beastmaster, because he doesn't understand the loss Moxxie feels after Scooter death, so he wants to participate. I would have LOOVE that. But no. 

More on the design: in previous BLs the enemy mobs have tons of variation in their custom, outlook. I have the artbook if BL and I know there was  a shit tons of iteration and variation for the enemies. But this game all the skeletons look the same. They could have use the same 3D models from the Tiny Tina DLC. Also the top of the mushroom guy looks like the top of a guy's d.ck.

The story and quest are full of conversations between NPCs, you are just here the listen. It fells into the same trap as modern films, where they explain the whole plot rather then show it to you.

Also linking how you look like to an item that gives you stats is bullshit. I hate how my character looks like but the gear gives me 3 skill points on my main skill.... this sucks. Also previous BLs had this figured out. WHY ON EARTH DO YOU KEEP CHANGING THINGS THAT WORKED???????

Honestly this game feels like nobody bothered testing it.

After beating the game as usual we get the list of creators and shit. In this game it is not skippable... Like a sad throwback to the 90's and it s a bloody long one. I have been sitting here for like 15 mins straight....

Take Borderlands 3, replace all those fantastically huge areas with a cheap chibi scale overworld map (the joke wears off within seconds) and reskin everything left as a fantasy game spoof. Gameplay is too similar to BL3 to make a difference, level design is that of an arena shooter and writing along the lines of a middling side quest you were too starved to not accept. I'm almost mad about the fact that they have a pen-and-paper RPG theme but don't bother putting any of that to good use except for overly cheap jokes stretched to almost all imaginable proportions.

But the worst of it all is how the time it takes from character creation to the overworld map (practically the tutorial), you're right beyond the magic 2h refund barrier.

The game is not nearly has long, expansive, or in depth as its predecessors, Pre-Sequel included. Its DLCs are very short and basically amounts to a short, 10 minute gauntlet, the main storyline and sidequests are fairly limited, and the endgame is short and dry. Instead of a full $60 game, I personally would only recommend buying it if the price falls below half. 

Another buyer-beware is the fact that it's been released here on Steam for a year and nearly two years on Epic, yet a ton of the game's glaring issues were never fixed. The audio level is way too low such that cranking everything to 100 still feels a little too faint. The audio range of sound effects and dialogues have this really weird quirk where if you look away from the sound source, it'll sound like it's been muffled by a wall made of mattresses. Doesn't matter if you're standing right next to the speaker. You look away and it's suddenly a garbled mess. Other than that, there are issues with dialogues skipping or not playing at all here and there, or they may overlap each other completely.

Barring all that. The game's great. I enjoy the banter between Tina, Frette, and Valentine, I enjoy the quirky humor of a Tiny Tina-hosted DnD, and I enjoy the further refinement of the fighting mechanics that were made better in Borderlands 3.

Lets start with the comedy, yes this is entirely subjective but I honestly don't think there are more than a handful of people that the jokes will land for. The jokes and gags in the game feel like someone trying to emulate BL2s humor but they don't understand what makes the game funny. They also forced in a lot of their political opinions into the game, everyone is entitled to their own opinions but I just wanna play games and escape from reality for a bit, not get reminded of it a bunch.

Second is the length of dialogue, there isn't much to say, there is a ton and it's very slow and boring. If you got the mod to add a skip button you could probably shave a day or two off your playtime depending on how long you can play each day.

Last is the bugs, there are so many UI/Menu/Encounter bugs that can softlock you or crash the game or whatever that it's laughable that they want $60 for the game. When playing through it with my friend we FREQUENTLY had to restart the game due to one of us being unable to do anything in game after an enemy touched us, or quest enemies just not spawning or spawning in a wall making them unkillable.

Sounds good, right? But no New Game + (wtf!), a terrible endgame and shortage of farmable bosses make Wonderlands worth buying only with a deep discount.
7/10 for original ideas (but could have been higher)
Total size on my hdd: 49 GB

++ DOOM-inspired gameplay is back. Grenades have been replaced by magic spells.
+ Even with other characters like Aloy (Horizon series) and Parvati (Outer Worlds) to her credit, Tiny Tina will forever be voice actress Ashley Burch’s signature role (for me, anyway). She’s as good as ever here.
+ Wanda Sykes, Andy Samberg and Will Arnett all turn in great performances.
+ Story doesn’t rival the Dragon Keep dlc of Borderlands 2, but is good.
+ Replacing the space-ship and map travel of Borderlands 3 is a table-top-rpg-style “overworld,” where you move a miniature of your in-game character around a 3D game board. There are ambushes, chests of loot, and random encounters. Great addition to Wonderlands, adding to the feeling of playing a classic rpg.
+ Legendaries are rare again!
+ Fun side-quests. One of my favorites was “The Ditcher,” which features famous monster hunter Gerritt of Trivia…
+ The best graphics of any Borderlands game.
+ Lots of character customization options
+ Most of the performance issues that plagued Borderlands 3 are not present in Wonderlands. Ran smooth and stutter free. 
+ Still has a DX11 mode, so if you’re still running an older gpu Wonderlands should work.

+/- Wonderlands is woke. There’s pronouns in the character creator, gay pirates, and Paladin Mike is Lorelei from Borderlands 3 (who has transitioned to Lor by the time New Tales from the Borderlands occurs, though Tiny Tina’s design indicates Wonderlands takes place before Borderlands 3). Whether any of that is a positive or negative is up to you.

-- No New Game +  A core part of every main Borderlands game to date (including the Pre-Sequel) has been replaying the main campaign with tougher enemies and more specialized loot in NG+. Gearbox seriously missed the mark here. 
- Those “random encounters” in the Overworld are the same areas, used over and over. There are a good variety – more than a dozen - which minimizes the fatigue of the repeated encounters. I guess there had to be a way to create randomized encounters while keeping Wonderlands under-budget, but completionists will need some serious fortitude to do everything in the Overworld.
- Endgame content features the “Chaos Chamber,” which repeats the levels from the “random encounters” of the Overworld with a few re-used bosses thrown in. It’s pathetic and borderline insulting (""just keep playing the same levels over and over, like a hamster running in a wheel"").
- Shortage of farmable bosses. You’ll get more consistent loot from vending machines.
- Levels are too large. You’ll spend a ton of time running around (because you can’t fast-travel until you’ve visited an area at least once).
- Default audio balance is terrible. Make sure to move some sliders around so you can actually hear the music.

You’ve still got some great ideas, Gearbox. Just need to give us franchise old-timers the bosses and endgame content we’ve come to expect.",1701712099,1701713034,True,2,0,0.516853928565979004,0,True,False,False

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is, how do I say this, okay?  I enjoyed the campaign enough, and I can see there is likely some good fun to be had with the endgame systems and mythic ranks, etc.  But about 1/3 of the way through the game I realized that this isn't the game I want to grind endgame with.

So, I set my sights to finishing the campaign and trying to just enjoy that.  For the most part, I did have fun.  I will do a brief pros/cons list below, but the general conclusion that I come up with is that it is a good game, with some nice components, but never really wows or captivates you to push on and explore everything it has to offer (at least for me).

PROS: 

* I absolutely love the way combat encounters are handled in the ""Overworld"" (that's the main open-world map that functions much like a board game).  You fight in an instance and once you complete the encounter, you get a 20-sided die to roll for loot.  Nice and compact, easily digestible bits of content.

* The dual-classing is nice.  I didn't feel quite as much impact with each choice of skills that I feel in other Borderlands games, but it is nice to be able to freely mix 2 classes together.  There is definitely some fun endgame synergy to be exploited there.

*  Style.  The game, even if it doesn't grab me like earlier Tiny Tina content, is still dripping with the colorful style of Borderlands and the way the visuals were done, combining fantasy and Borderlands, well done.  Great use of colors.

*  Voice acting is solid, even if Tina screams or mumbles most of her lines.  You can get the gist and the banter is at least passable as comedy.  There are some actual drama moments, too, but I will just leave that there as you need to play to discover it...

* Butt Stallion

CONS

*  Not very compelling... this is such a vague way to describe a con, but it just doesn't grab me.  Maybe the standards of prior Tiny Tina content is what makes this a con, as if I never played anything related to Tina before, I might see the content as compelling.  She just set such a bar.  Kinda like how villains have been somewhat ruined by the near perfection that was Handsome Jack.  

*  I didn't like my player voice, just saying...

*  Just didn't feel like playing endgame, which means I got a bit bored... so, take that for what you will.

CONCLUSION

* Good game on sale.  I have been told that the Wonderlands Redux mod is the best way to enjoy this game, but the advice is to have all DLC to enjoy the mod fully and I just didn't feel this game deserved more $ from me just to play the mod.  I actually have tried multiple times and in multiple ways to get someone to let me know just how vital the DLC is for the mod, as the only responses came from people who read the same line as me, suggesting all DLC.  So, in that regard, I'd suggest looking for some great combo sale (on sale a bunch so it shouldn't take long) to be sure you can get everything out of the Wonderlands Redux mod.  

Aside from that, I am glad I played it.  I left the game in menus too many times to really gauge how long it takes to complete as my hours played are way stretched from having to get up and leave it running so often.  I just wouldn't spend more than deep sale prices, there are better full priced options out there.

This review was made after beating every side quest and the base game, will be updated upon reaching chaos 20 and fighting all forms of raid bosses I can find. There is a TLDR.

I absolutely love the borderlands series (Tales from the Borderlands V2 doesn't exist in my eyes) and I have I estimate around 4000 hours of Borderlands game time over several steam accounts, most of which is Borderlands 2. The series is incredible with exception (New tales), but has some flaws. I am a fan boy, and will leave suggestions for fixes at the end.

Start:
General
The game starts off simple but has great customisation for voice, builds, what your character looks like, and even stats. The new melee, necklace AND ring system is brilliant, it allows for brand spanking new ways to develop a character and new things to potentially farm. The new weapon names are fun and keep in line with the tradition of a less serious game (Ferior being the new tediore and the opposite to inferior is surprisingly funny), with most of the old weapon manufacturers returning. 

Specifics:
Combat:
I was disappointed with how basically every enemy type is the same. The only difference being they are bandits, skeletons, skeleton pirates or an animal (re skins unless your looking at goblins, cobras, crabs or Sharks). Wyvern F***ing suck to fight if you have a melee build, and feel ridiculously annoying to fight with even slightly under powered gear or very few skill points for a build. However, apart from finding the start of the game with very little build quite challenging the rest of the game was easy. Fast fire rate = damage. I found the bosses to be the most challenging but even then they were mostly damage sponges with special attacks to jump over, duck under or sidestep. My favourite boss was Kastor (the normal sized skeleton) Mostly because I thought it was a funny idea, and the boss fight was at the right stage of the game at being just hard enough whilst also not a pushover.

Setting: 
The wonderlands is cool, the world map would be a little more creative with more shortcut methods rather then just punch the bottle cap, and maybe the speed shrine should have been part of the base character kit with the shrine just making them sonic levels speed. The fact you can punch encounters or outrun them does help encounters not feel bad.

Story:
Its not handsome Jack levels of greatness, but not horrendous, you just really have to like Tiny Tina to not get bored (I got bored even with liking her character from Bl2). Its simple and doesn't get in the way too much.

Jokes: 
Its not funny. NEXT (Mr Torgue does get to be awesome though)

Loot:
OK, Compared to borderlands 3 there are very few and occasional legendary items. I myself found around 6 including the 2 I got from the final boss, but the system that makes red text weapons spawn in vendors in brilliant, as I can jot down the name of a weapon I like and farm for it later. Loot luck is a system with a lot to be desired, the loot luck dice system gives you better loot luck (chances at a legendary or purples) the more you collect/at higher chaos levels. This system makes you explore every map for them which would be cool if it gave you hints as to where they are. 

Music:
Fine, but I have nothing positive or negative to say. Its just music unfortuntly.

My fixes: 
More enemy types, flying enemies either land more or come down to the ground slightly more so you can almost always jump hit them.
Loot Luck dice should give a reater bonus and give the maximum buff from a map at 5 dice collected instead of 20. this gives people the benefit of not having to rush through a long map or specifically complete a side quest to unlock an area to get just one more dice and instead spend more time playing the game.


Update:

TLDR: 

A fine game but the difficulty curve is the wrong way round and the system for getting legendary is bad and annoying.

POSITIVE STUFF:
- Game is gorgeous; best arenas and puzzles across the BL games
- Awesome gunplay; spells are really cool
- Great audio design

NEGATIVES:
- The story stinks; even worse than BL3, which I didn't hate. Lots of story setup, the villain gets interesting but then the game ends with a fart. Zero payoff
- The side-quests are bad. The fantasy world created here looks amazing, but its characters are all flat and boring. You'll get a few good sidequests here and there but most are just not interesting.

- Loot is bad; This is what killed the game for me.

- ""Luck"" mechanic forcing you to collect random dice around the game world in order to increase your chances at gaining good gear in every respect, but the system is WAY too harsh. Destroying a boss and getting showered with green loot never feels good. Felt like every chest I opened, every store visit I would find nothing useful. Literally all of my gear (that I would have to use for 5+ levels) came from SHIFT keys.

- Inventory management is absolutely terrible and felt like busy-work, and you are alwasy having to be in the terrible menus.

- Leveling is very slow and tedious; early on you level up at a good pace but the further you get the more it starts to just CRAWL. 1 hour per level, it seemed like.

I can't recommend this one, especially to Borderlands fans.",1701569777,1701569777,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Mainly the whole gun thing it just makes mobs feel like shit because mods actually use magic and melee and bows no shit a gun beat all those things.

Gameplay (Borderlands + Dungeon&Dragons)
Replayable
New Characters & Old Characters
More Classes To Choose From/Mix&Match Towards Endgame
Chaos Chambers/Mini Dungeons 
More Fun With Friends
Bought On Sale For 50% Off

-Cons
DLC *mainly wasn't a fan of any of these since its felt very rushed and repetitive and you have to do each of the DLC's 4 times for the achievements which was very annoying

Less gameplay comparing to other borderlands titles (Borderlands 1, 2 & 3) but also might be do to the pandemic when the game was being released so just want to include this!

Hackers & Cheaters are always a turn off for every game but it really ruins it for multiplayer trying to play with people and not being able to find a lot of legit players through matchmaking when people are hosting XP Boost lobbies etc.

compared to BL3 the writing is substantially better

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands perfectly continues the Borderlands tradition giving you dozens of hours of fun, challenging, and utterly ridiculous FPS/RPG goodness, set in some of the most downright inspiring, majestic, and occasionally hilarious backdrops of any game.  I really feel like everyone involved in the fundamental ""impossibly sweeping vistas"" aspect of these games deserves royalties because I absolutely play these games in no small part because I know the backgrounds will be incredibly memorable.  The atmosphere and light-hearted nature of the games is also a big appeal for me personally; I play games to have a good time, and the vibes in most of these games fits that perfectly.

In fact, I daresay Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is my favorite Borderlands game so far.  The framing device of characters from the Borderlands world sitting down to play a D&D game--complete with the overworld map being full of soda cans, Cheetos, books, and other tabletop gaming ephemera--is so extremely good and so full of untapped potential on its own that it begs for further sequels aping other real-world-physical-gaming tropes.  I am no wargamer but I absolutely salivate thinking about a second game where Tiny Tina introduces her gaming group to Bunkers & Badasses 40K.  But yeah it is amazing how much more sense the standard Borderlands fourth-wall-breaking comments and constant strings of coincidences make here than in any previous title, and even though I know they are making Borderlands 4, I think they should make it definitively the last and wrap up that game's convoluted narratives in favor of leaning hard into Tina's unreliable narrator metadrama rendition of their world.

They even manage to cruelly mine some heartache out of the out-of-game narrative, especially for people familiar with Tiny Tina's character arc over the span of Borderlands 2/Pre-Sequel/3.

Damn, I love this game.  The only bad thing about Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is that Gearbox is a trash company filled with amazing people who should be working for someone else.",1701305121,1701305121,True,2,0,0.516891896724700928,0,True,False,False

You dont have to buy and play the dlc people. The main game is SO. MUCH. FUN.  people hate things just to hate them and it's dumb. Games are supposed to be fun. 

Pros: 
-Really funny
-Most aspects of Borderlands that you know and love including loot and level up progression systems
-Story is cute and adds a lot of aspects of Dungeons and Dragons even including typical stereotypes of players.
-The main characters are interesting, especially Tina and Valentine. I love how they expanded on Tina's backstory and motivations for having the DnD game and you get to build a closer emotional connection with her.

Cons:
-The dungeons are super repetitive and there's like 4 different maps you do them on and they get old very quick
-The in-DnD characters are either not interesting and become very forgettable, or the interesting ones don't stay around which is very upsetting.

After all that time, I've come to the conclusion that it's just not a genuinely good game. It's got some good aspects to it that are unique to it for the series (i.e. character creation, more stats, melee weapons). These aspects really make it stand out from the others in the series. One thing that this has though that is also still like the original series is the terrible writing. Don't come to this game for a decent story. It's biggest flaw is just the lack of loot variety. With all the fun things this game adds, it's just simply crushed by not being able to do anything with it. I wish there was more to do in this game simply because it's got a unique artsyle and premise that you just can't find in most games. It's just a huge piece of wasted potential

The only reason I have so many hours in this is that it was sooo easy for me to lose interest in this game and I just left it open on my desktop.

There is nothing bad ass about this game.  It is heavily geared toward alternative lifestyles. The main story revolves around the ""Butt Stallion"" character.   There are no defined body styles - everything is androgynous.  The entire rest of the game leans heavily on these themes.  

There is no more ""roaming the borderlands.""  Every single interaction is carefully designed to take you to the next interaction.  As long as you accept every side quest, you will cover every single square inch of each map.

All of the levels are waves and check points, the game plays in a wave/guided manner.  

The cut scenes and forced interactions are super painful.  Each of them sometimes takes minutes and there are TONS of them.  You are going to get super sick of Tina, especially when she tells you ""RNG aint got nothing on you."" a 100 times.

The tree abilities suck.  Nothing special, just plus or minus %'s.

Even if you want to try a different build, you have to sit through the endless cut scenes to get it.  

So ""progressive"" of them to be so inclusive but this is not a BL game, and no one should pretend it is.

Gameplay: 7/10 i like the game mechanics but the skill tree is lame, the weapons are odd but still fun to play with and spells along with a skill is a interesting mechanic. it is also a lil repetitive 
Story: 7/10 i love the comedy and tiny Tina narrating your every move. BUT it is missing something. maybe i have yet to see something as i have not yet beaten it.... but,... meh
dialog: 4/10 most of the characters are annoying. especially paladin mike. i have played every character and He/she/it is just so obnoxious. sounds like a chick trying to voice for a man, and has no power/emotion behind the dialog. a VERY forced character.

Fortunately for me, I was only able to start playing this game recently, I've restarted the campaign a few times and had to abandon my first build (companions) cuz my potato PC couldnt handle all the stuff I was spawning and just reached LVL 40 on a ""Thor"" build.

Holy shit, I watched a few videos about the Thor builds and I'm not even following them closely and my gear is shite but its still so stupidly good. Maybe endgame might change my perspective but Im excited to create other new builds.

Its pretty cool, it seems there are a lot of build variety, vehicles in the BL series is replaced with the Overworld which i think is a cool alternative. 

Most if not all side quests are all packaged into their own areas of the ""story"" maps OR has their own unique map with its own side quests. Its a tiny bit annoying that some of the side quests are compulsory in order to unlock the rest of the story and hidden stuff in the Overworld, but I can take that as ""breathers"" for the story.

I have my problems with legendaries. When it comes to variety, Feriore for example, is one of the only viable weapon manufacturer options for a ""Companions only"" play through, but not a single legendary Feriore weapon does anything companion related. (The rest is WIP)

If things somehow go well, I can foresee Wonderlands having insane expansions, like adding a 3rd tree into the mix, or being able to use the same class twice/thrice, effectively making an ultra pure build. 

I like this game, I like the concept that BL tries to make but also having the ability to make my own character instead of using a preset. I hope Gearbox can somehow make this work cuz I really love it a lot.

Another game that doesn't really deserve the amount of positive reviews it has.

My interest in the game was instantly lost as soon as I opened the game. In character creation you can already see that the game isn't worth the money. Even on sale (imo). The main reason I feel most people are drawn to D&D is the ability to create a character. At the beginning there are so few options, I almost quit and refunded right then and there.  I know there should be some cosmetics to unlock but I feel like it should be a few and maybe just from completing quests or killing bosses. Not random drops. At the point of typing this I have played 8 hours and I have not unlocked anything that makes this game feel like D&D. No hats, no Staffs, no Bows, No accessories of any kind, No cool armor to make my character look badass. nothing, just colors. 

The world is generally empty with TONS of boxes everywhere that give you nothing. 95% of the boxes in the world can be ignored unless you need ammo, which doesn't happen often. The Dice is never worth getting. The quests are extremely boring and the dialogue drags alot, especially during quests.... and the dialogue isn't even that good in most cases. Other than Tiny Tina, the whole game feels soulless. And Tina doesn't even feel like herself, maybe it's because she has way more dialogue now, but she feels way less energetic and she just, kinda explains things and has no other impact on the story or whats happening.  

The game has a tough time starting up most of the time which I don't understand, gotta be a coding issue or something. I'm not a fan of the music in the game, pretty boring or kinda annoying. I've heard better ""whimsical"" or fantasy music that actually played well into the visuals or atmosphere. This was not it.
The visuals although ""cleaner"" actually feel like a step back. They are just way less interesting. Bland normal forests and structures. I just feel like there was so little creativity put into this world and the objects. 

The difficulty in the game is weird. It's extremely boring and easy most of the time but randomly a bomb will go off and you almost insta-die. It doesn't feel great. 
Combat feels awful. I think the reticle sensitivity changes based on the gun, which I don't like. Melee feels extremely unsatisfying, feels like i'm hitting them with a pool noodle. Spells are terrible. The only one that actually feels useful is the homing missile, since it can't really miss. 

Overall pretty disappointed with this purchase. It does however make me want to go back and replay Borderlands 2. *shrug*

TTWL was a step back in both game-play and story, it's guns went to a mixture of melee and arrow physics(which surprisingly don't work out that well in borderlands), everybody raves about the melee aspect for these games, but when they essentially force you into using it, it's very much a bad thing.
the story is also just basically !!!![SPOILERS]!!!! 



OMG! this bad guy who very much resembles handsome jack killed the ""mcguffin"" queen butt-stallion, go kill him as revenge for killing this character that you met for a total of 10 seconds. oh no the bad guy has a bunch of other bad guys that are trying to stop you from stopping him....here are some dumb quests so that we can drag out the story even longer so we can justify the price tag that we put on the game.

and then the fucking god awful map system. whoever thought that making the transition between levels into a top down view that you have to fucking puzzle your way through to even get to some areas is a complete jackass and they should be shot. like Christ sakes it's a terrible idea. 

also, there are no vehicles in the game, so traversing each level is a slow ass slog across until you find the ""rune"" or whatever that speeds up your slides, then you end up just sliding across the map everywhere because it's faster. and then the bosses....I can't remember a single god damned boss from this game, they are all THAT forgettable, like honestly, non of the boss fights are even worth looking back on at all because none of them drop any loot that is worth a damn. people complained about dedicated legendarys in BL3, but funnily enough this game is worse for that.

long story short, this game is bad when it comes to gameplay, good when it comes to graphics and particle effects, but terrible in so many other ways. so all in all this game gets a solid 4/10 in my opinion.",1700402089,1700402089,False,1,0,0.508639335632324219,1,True,False,False

I did enjoy being able to create your own character, but it needs more body type options in the general loot pool.  The class actions are weak and replacing grenades with spammy ""magic"" items is a mistake.  Having one skill tree per class is very boring and restricts how you can play your toon.

The narration was a bit too middle-schoolish and lacked the adult targeted humor I remember from the last Tiny Tina dlc. A number of the voice overs just didn't land for me either - Wanda as the robot co-dnd character landed flat for me. Her voice and inflection seems a fit for the nonchalant robot, but her voice just drew me out of the narrative of the story. Every time she speaks it sounds like I'm listening to a disinterested actor reading from a card. 

The gun play as well ... this IS the reason to play borderlands - shoot and loot - empowered by the satisfaction you get from the said pew pew. I'll keep playing this game to see if it just takes more time to find the right weapon for me, but every drop in this so far feels very under powered or has a needlessly overpowered scope. Where are the iron sights?

Lastly, I am playing on an ultrawide monitor - from my research this is becoming a more popular choice in monitor.

He's all hyped up to dive into Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, this supposed epic adventure full of whimsy, wonder, and high-powered weaponry. Roll your own multiclass hero, they said. Shoot, loot, slash, and cast on a quest to stop the Dragon Lord, they promised. Sounds like a blast, right? Well, not for Dave.

Our hero starts his journey expecting a fantasy-themed Borderlands extravaganza. But hold on to your loot bags, because Dave's ride through this so-called ""Wonderland"" feels more like a trip to Mr. Bones' Wild Ride—a roller coaster that never ends and is about as much fun as a dentist appointment.

First off, people are hating on this game like it's the last season of Game of Thrones. One disgruntled fan even said, ""I regret pre-ordering now, thinking I would get a fantasy-themed Borderlands game, and then got this."" Ouch, Dave's off to a fantastic start.

Now, let's talk about the characters. Apparently, Tiny Tina, the once-beloved dynamo, got a downgrade to ""unlikable"" in this game. And don't even get started on her co-player characters—the robot and bland guy. They're so forgettable they don't even deserve names. Someone's sipping on a tall glass of disappointment.

The humor, or lack thereof, is another sore point. One player mournfully recalls, ""I laughed maybe once in this whole game."" Yeah, Tiny Tina's attempt at comedy is about as successful as a fish riding a unicycle. And the skills? Lame. The companions? Annoying. Skeletor screaming in your ear every five minutes? What kind of sadistic game designer thought that was a good idea?

Now, let's take a moment for the villain, Mr. Dragon Lord. Apparently, his plan is to destroy the planet he lives on. Real genius move, buddy. The whole ""I don't like one little girl, so let's destroy everything"" shtick is just plain stupid. Handsome Jack is rolling in his villainous grave.

And don't even get me started on the movement. Walking feels like a chore, and you know what's missing? Cars! Yup, the first Borderlands IP without a single car. Because who needs vehicles in a lootershooter, right?

Dave, poor Dave, is feeling like he's stuck on Mr. Bones' Wild Ride, desperately searching for an exit. Consider uninstalling midway? That's on the table. And the final verdict? ""Annoying characters, bad movement, boring combat, and uninteresting story. If you like Borderlands, skip this game.""

So there you have it, folks. Dave's descent into Tiny Tina's No-Fun Wonderland, where whimsy and wonder take a backseat to disappointment.",1699858790,1699858790,False,20,8,0.579760372638702393,0,True,False,False

The characters are reduced to shallow one note versions of themselves.
The humor just... well it doesn't hit for me. I laughed maybe once in this whole game.
The skills are pretty lame. The companions are extremely annoying because they come with extra voice lines. Oh yeah I sure love hearing Skeletor screaming the thing in my ear every 5 minutes. Or my character making the same fart joke at a mushroom. The chaotic playstyle feels gutted. All those special skills that would completely change your entire play style are just gone. Now it's just ""if you hit a critical the bullet ricochets"" (away from enemies I stg)
And the villain GOD. The best thing about the first few games was Handsome Jack. The worst thing about the third games were the evil tiktok twins. But those were believable compared to Mr. Dragon Lord. What's your plan? oh to destroy the planet? BITCH YOU LIVE HERE. you dont have a space ship to leave. It's just ""I don't like one little girl"" spite to kill himself and everyone else around him. I'm sorry that's stupid. You can't make me care about a villain you're trying to make empathetic. 
Also, they added secrets, would be fun but the movement has been severely gutted. Walking feels like a chore and all you can do is walk. First borderlands IP without a single car. 
Speaking of the horrid movement, and I talk about level design? So this game is a lootershooter. The loot is a big and FUN part of the game. Collecting, selling... well I'd love to sell, if there were any vendors. In one map, the only 2 vendors are like a 5 minute walk from the nearest teleport point. in one map, there's only a teleportable vendor at the very very end of a map, after a 30 minute mission. It ain't fun. Just not. 
At this point, I feel like I'm playing it as a chore because I already put money into it. But I'm really considering just uninstalling midway through then never touching it again.

I am a little under 20 hours into the game and have practically done everything this game has to offer. It needs more meat on its bones if they expect people to shell out a full $60 on this. The DLCs offered do nothing to remedy this issue as each of them feel like they were made in a week. You can clear an entire DLC in under an hour and while they allow you to replay them, there really is no point other then to farm currency for random loot. You also don't have a real reason to replay the game as you can somewhat swap your entire characters class, although you wont be able to do every single combination on one character.

The story and writing is something I can shrug off. I don't think its necessarily bad even though some of the voice lines make me cringe, but I can also tell its just not targeted for me. The inverse could be said for the earlier entries and some players not enjoying the writing in the Borderlands universe so I don't feel I can fault the game for that. The progression is an interesting idea and I enjoyed it but I wish they kind of stuck to the DND theme of the game. It's kinda off putting to believe that its just a tabletop but the way its portrayed is more akin to you just existing in the table tops dimension? One or the other would have been better than both at the same time.

The guns suck, they don't feel as fun as Gearbox traditionally has made them and changing up a lot of the formula with all the extra equippable slots isn't something I'm fond of as it's still a little too complex for me to know if I'm building correctly. The entire feel of the game however is very polished in my opinion. I rarely come across gameplay issues but I will say their system for hidden collectibles is so asinine. It's so much more painful to collect everything than it was in Borderlands 3. I absolutely detest this system. 

In total I give the game a 6/10 but highly suggest avoiding it at it's AAA price tag.

We had tons of fun with friends on Borderlands 2 and associated DLCs and stuff and this is just absolutely not the case here. The game looks very good but it feels like that's all. It feels very hollow, with a very uninteresting story, and not very exciting mechanics. Also the shear amount of loot we find makes it so that you basically need to pause your gameplay every minute to assess whether or no you should change your weapons and it's really annoying. Where characters were really a key point of previous games, here they are empty, unlikable, annoying, and CONSTANTLY TALKING OH MY GOD CAN I CATCH A BREAK??? It's even hard to follow the narrative because it's always happening at the same time as all the explosions and combat, I feel like it's not well paced at all.

Yes you still have Tina but other than that everything has changed even the gameplay. You do not have grenades and instead of that you have skills and abilities at the same time in different slots. That was hard to get used to but after that phase it felt really good. And most importantly you do not play as a specific character. You are playing yourself. The Borderlands universe welcomes you as a ""newbie"" and you are just you who plays bunkers and badasses with Tina. So that is why you we do not have lore info in this game

I do not really know why they developed a game like this but as i said it before: if your approach to this game is have a new experience then this game fills your expectations. It has different item slots like rings and books and melee weapons, it has a very similar atmosphere with borderlands 3 which is nice, and it has a really smooth and chaotic gameplay that satisfies both new players to this universe and fans like me. I did not quit the game until finished every single side quest. So i can easily give 7.5 out of 10.

There are 2 reasons behind why this wonderlands does not deserve 10. Firstly, this game might have better atmosphere with better musics but instead musics are just existing and you do not even recognize them. Second reason is lack of enemy types. There are just 3 maybe 4 different types of enemies and that's it. You are keeping fighting against same enemies around the world.

""Paladin mike""
Tooth ""Fairy""

And the gay undead pirate captains.

Several more speeches about sensitivity.
And they *targeted* kids with this by making sure the rating was ""teen"".

But that's not even why I'm giving a negative review.

What I lived about TTW over BL series:
Overworld map
All quests scaled with level
Multiclassing

One of the pitfalls of BL1 and 2 was ""Loot didn't become interesting until *after* you beat the game"".  This was fixed in BL3, which was a BLAST.  In Tina's... The loot options were abysmal, somehow exeedingly worse than any of the series.  
At one point, most of the enemies had thousands of health, and 90% of the weapons/spells being dropped had a dps in the teens.  Or my favorite ""Worst weapon in the history of gaming"": ""Unlimited magazine, 4.6s time to fix, 5 shots per second... Magazine size... TWO""  And the damage was *really* low on the two shots.  You'd spend 99% of your time reloading.
It didn't matter if something was interesting, as 99.9% of drops weren't even remotely close to viable.
Same with spells... Got stuck with one spell for 20 levels, because everything else was TWO orders of magnitude less damage... and the spell I had wasn't even good.

Prices were all over the map too... sell price $2000 for a white trash loot... $300 for that epic that just dropped.  

The insistent whining by the ""narrators""... 
They made Tina absolutely pathetic, whiny, and desperate for attention
Jokes were unfunny, as they constantly filled in with obligatory ""We can't do that because it's insensitive""

These next two really, really got me:
Constant, not stop, gurgling/screaming at *bat sh*** crazy obnoxious volumes  (If you turn these down, you can't hear anything else...)
Bright flashes overlapping to the point where it was utterly impossible to see the enemy 99% of the time.  The only way I could even kill stuff was to use non-target spells/abilities/weapons.

To be remotely playable, remove the screaming/gurgling entirely.  When you char screams at you for 30 seconds, while 10+ skeletons are gurgle/screaming at the same time... It's obnoxious and removes all fun.
Tone down the brightness of flashes by 99% and make them transparent by reducing alpha by 99% so I can *see* the enemies.

Worst in the series by a *very* large margin.

Look at # of reviews and rating... BL3 90k reviews, 85% positive.  TTW: 10k reviews 76% positive.

It is a DND-themed game so having the game play loop being a dungeon crawler mode I thought was fitting. If you are not sold on the chaos chamber endgame then the story, and its 40-some-odd side quests, will provide around 35-40 hrs of game play. Every side quest was very entertaining, and they may even be the best of the entire series. Lastly, I will note the T rating shows in this one.

It falls short in terms of meaningful character progression and plot when compared to older entries in the borderlands universe, but it doesn't really feel like it matters overall as the gameplay is fun enough to save it. 

It's good dumb fun with a silly plot line, entertaining characters, some Borderlands staple pop-culture references, and lovingly pokes fun at DnD in the same manner as the Borderlands 2 DLC ""Assault on Dragon Keep"".
 
It can get a bit repetitive, with some grindy ""combat encounters"" (which can be made less frequent/avoided, although some are still part of side quests), but it does offer solid gun play with the usual ridiculous Borderlands weaponry and scratches the ""looter"" itch. 

Magic (rather than grenades) makes a fun addition to the character loadout and the familiars are handy if you are not playing co-op. 

Word of warning: I did get really irritated by some really bad use of invisible walls throughout. 
For example: 
- Tangledrift in particular repeatedly has ledges that should be reachable, blocked off by invisible walls so you fall to your death, when they could simply have NOT put the ledges there?
- In another area an entire bridge gap is blocked by an invisible wall so you can't jump it, because a bridge will be put there later, even though the gap is VERY clearable. 

--------

TLDR

Pros:
- Good borderlands gunplay and loot
- beautiful fantasy landscapes in the Borderlands style 
- Magic and DnD theme is fun
- Familiars can be helpful if you are playing solo

Cons:
- some bad invisible wall usage
- bit grindy / repetitive
- missing the ""depth"" of some of the better Borderlands entries


It's not for everyone (I think I preferred the Pre-sequel to this) but the Wonderlands are still a fun distraction for those that love the Borderlands series and a bit of DnD. 
Probably worth catching in a sale although the DLC could be passed over for no real loss.

I enjoyed Dragon Keep, but Dragon Keep worked because it was about something.

Wonderlands feels like a gigantic meaningless blip of a game.

The voice acting is fine, but the writing feels flat and bland. The script leans on references instead of humor, and it's peppered with ""we're playing an arr pee gee, isn't that kind of lame?"" remarks, which, like. I can't believe I'm writing this, but something like South Park Stick Of Truth pulls this formula off way better because it actually cares about and has an opinion on the rpg stuff it's making fun of.

Wonderlands feels like it's made entirely of filler text. Half its content is airgapped from the main plot, stuffed into *large* optional areas, and none of the npcs really have any luster to them.

Tina's VA does a fantastic job, but is fighting uphill against the phoned-in-ed-ness of the rest of the game.

The gameplay is roughly the same as other Borderlands, with a neat change in that you select your class, not your character, and you can multiclass to mix power sets. However, Wonderlands is also buggier than any other Borderlands, and there's a persistent interact glitch that I keep getting stuck in. I've also bugged out the fight for your life state by jumping, and this turned enemy AI and damage vulnerability off. It's been ages since release, and I don't think these are getting fixed.

If you're really desperate for a looter shooter, I guess Wonderlands fits the bill, but I'd get it on super duper sale and keep your expectations at floor level.

Also the dlc feels even more phoned in than the main game. It's just arenas with a voiceover. It barely has waypoint markers.

Edit: Rolled credits. It picks up slightly at the end, but *very* slightly. Not enough to justify having to get to it. And in a setting like Borderlands, where the bulk of the appeal is the characters, the villain being the only really likeable one is painful. The plot doesn't go anywhere. If it was shortened down to the length of Dragon's Keep, it would be better, but still not better than Dragon's Keep, which is a problem because it doesn't tread any new territory.

The gameplay *can* be fun at times, and there were some points when I enjoyed myself, but any replay value I would've gotten is spoiled by the games awful ending. One of the biggest letdowns of my whole life frankly, and I had to be told that my dad was a meth addict when I was 10. 2/10, this game is an insult to the franchise, and that's saying a lot considering it was preceded by BL3",1693964688,1696830651,False,3,0,0.487403005361557007,0,True,False,False

SICK of the updates. 

Since I have the time let's discuss some of the problems with this game aside from the already stated. 

1. Half assed. Reskinned borderlands 3. A few additions but really not much. The addition of magic is great but there is very little in the way of variety. It's clear that not much effort was put into this making it feel like a last minute after thought.  The same applies to the wepons. Nothing original when it comes to the guns. SERIOUS disappointment. 

2. Plot holes. No real explanation of where we are in the borderlands universe / timeline. Our main characters get basically no backstory and there is very little that gives us any connection to the story other than random memory drops through dialog as the game progresses. All of which leads to an explanation about the games origin which has no point of reference at any point in any borderlands game prior. This is like putting a Pepsi sticker on a coke can........

3. Overworld. Not a fan. It's cheesy in a bad way not a charming way. It's slow, tedious, and uninventive. The only thing about it that makes it even slightly redeemable is the possibility of random encounters. This seems like a throwback to vintage games that no one cares about or remembers. It also feels like some kind of move to make the game feel Nintendo-ish, to be clear I'm not a fan of the wii u menu word and that is what it reminds me of. 

4. Gear. Drops are garbage. I literally picked up three rerolls of the same spell in a single loot. The story and environments are a bigger part of the drive in the game for me, but the big fights are all about loot, LOOT!!!! Sadly there is very little and nothing much in the way of rares, even on big fights and boss fights. FAIL!

5. Points system, skill tree. You don't even get enough points to make it to the bottom of your two trees. Who's idea was this? Cause you need to fire that person. You're telling me that I have to choose between completing a skill tree to reach the ultimate ability or having a balanced character who is ""multiclass""?... ??? You're  F$%&ing joking right? At cap level I have one tree barely filled in and a second 1/3 complete with no way to gain anymore points. Your call but if your going to handicap the players ability to build the character don't call it multiclassing. 


The positive things about the game, the art is incredible.  The environments are visually impressive.  I wish there were more interactive items in world, but again this entire production feels rushed. There are clearly places in the map that were intended for something but have no purpose or function. I'm one of those turn over every rock, look behind every waterfall kind of players. 

I acknowledge that this isn't borderlands and I'm okay with that. It wasn't meant to be, but this feels like a half finished game, or a bunch of DLC's slapped together under a singular title. I like the game more or less. Maybe start putting some effort in to rounding it out and making it the actual game it should have been with all of these updates.

positives:
i love the fact that once you progress enough you can pick a secondary class

It was almost an immediate turn off to hear Andy Samberg and Wanda Sykes in the opening and you are unfortunately stuck with them for the entire game. Bojack Horseman did his job pretty decently, absolutely no reasons to complain there. And it was nice that they reverted Tina back to when she was actually funny instead of whatever they did to her in 3.

They decided to go for an entirely different experience with character customization and it's not horrible, but there aren't nearly enough options from the start. It's crazy difficult to make a feminine looking character and all of the armor colors are dingy, drab, and bland OR a massive seizure inducing headache.

My personal highlight of the entire game is the classes! There's so many choices and they all play fairly uniquely,  The choice to put stat points in the game is fitting for the DnD style but it is annoying, with the level cap being 40, how you have to specialize in stats to get the most out of your build.

The addition of spells instead of grenades was a welcome change! There's plenty of different effects from healing, to buffing, to just straight damage and they're infinite! No more having to worry about running out of them mid-fight. They added ring slots as well, a nice little extra buff to help specialize whatever build you're going for, but you unfortunately don't get the second ring slot until you beat the game. A very stupid decision.

I hated the overworld when I first got there. It's ugly, you're a bobblehead for no particular reason, and the controls are jank as hell. Eventually it grows on you I guess, it's a very different way of doing travel between areas compared to older games but hopefully they won't be using it again in the next games.

There's shockingly not that many glitches in the game in my experience, you will get constant ui glitches where things get stuck until they're refreshed but it's not game breaking so get over it. The quest Little Boys Blue in the Weepwild Dankness is broken as hell, I had to restart is twice because spawns kept breaking and there is no work-around aside from just starting over.

It's a weird issue to have but there's multiple examples of fast travel points not being at the start of levels? Which is a crazy design choice that I can't remember ever being a problem before. As I was writing this I learned you can actually travel straight to the overworld :D But it's still weird to not have fast travel stations at the start of levels. And there aren't nearly enough vending machines in this game. There were stretches where I'd go an entire level without selling anything because I didn't want to have to run back to where I was.

All in all this game is great! It's shocking they could actually still make something this decent after the sh*tshow that was BL3. Definitely get it on sale, you'd be crazy to think this game is worth 60 bucks.",1696688295,1696688295,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

That said I'd give it a solid 6/10. This is by far my least favorite borderlands game I've ever played. 

Pros. Gotta start here to give it SOME credit because it actually does some good things:
- Melee weapons; A whole slew of melee enhancing weapons that actually add something that enhances the gameplay, it's always fun to get a new weapon that does some crazy shit when you swing it.
- Crossbow/magic guns; a very interesting addition to borderland's already growing arsenal and honestly some of them are really fun to use.
- Borderlands 3 engine; Despite it's mixed reviews on the story, Borderlands 3 had the best gunplay out of the entire franchise so passing that on to this was actually a pretty good idea.
- Magic instead of grenades; the spells are actually really fun to use at times because of their variety and cast method. you can make some pretty fun builds with them if you find the right ones.

The Meh, things that arent that good but also not bad enough, kinda a middle ground:
- The story; it's not good but it's not bad. it's lacking overall but it does still have a few fun moments. Most of it is entirely forgettable though.

The Cons, there is no good without some bad:
- Dull enemies; The enemies are bland and generic having no more than 5-7 voice lines for each enemy type and they range from either easy references or puns. You will hear lines repeated sometimes twice in a row from the same enemy. None of them seem to have any personality to them.
- That world map; This is by far the worst travel system I've seen in any borderlands game as well as being completely pointless. The other borderlands games already had a decent method of travel as well as an easy to use fast travel. This on the other hand is just annoying.
- Combat arenas; not sure what else to call these but that's what they are. instead of making new areas to fight in they just occasionally stick you in a premade arena and fight waves of enemies till you get spat back out to the world map and call that a mission. You will absolutely fight in each of the same spaces at least 30 times in you're adventure.

- The Rating. 
Had to give this one it's own space because this is the biggest flaw in the game. This is currently the only borderlands game in the franchise that is rated T for teen as opposed to M for mature. If you played this game before and wondered why it doesn't feel like the other borderlands games, this is why. It's limited itself with its ability to go all the way with certain jokes and it causes them to fall flat. The main charm of the borderlands games have always been how unnecessarily brutal, disturbing and gritty it could get with it's world. This is essentially a borderlands game that's trying to play it safe and not hurt anyone's feelings with it's unique brand of humor and it doesn't work. Even the most entertaining character's from the previous games like Mister Tourgue is a bit underwhelming (I mean he's trying and he still manages to be the best part of the game again).

Every single Borderlands game after second one showed 2 was just a fluke and after the writers of BL2 quit they are just lost on narrative and humor.
Gameplay was fine. It's basically BL3 but everyone is a Siren. I enjoyed the end game Chaos mode and overworld is a nice edition.
Enemy variety is lacking and game is extremely easy even on hardest difficulty. There are serious balancing issues on received damage. Enemy bullets does almost no damage while single touch from an environmental hazard will put you on last stand under 3 seconds. 
I'm still giving this one a recommended for the mindless fun it provides but having played every game on the series so far I'm pretty I'm not going to touch any future Borderlands game. Series is on a downwards slope and unless they came up with something critically acclaimed it will be the end of Gearbox.
Quick warning. DO NOT buy the DLC's unless you buy the complete edition. They add no new enemies no new environment and each one lasts 10 minutes to finish with a single unique boss at the end. So you are basically buying a DLC for a single boss. Non of which are memorable.

Wonderlands – is a spin-off of the Borderlands series. Gameplay and storytelling systems are virtually identical. It’s certainly not without some innovations, but it generally plays and feels the same as BL3.
 
There’s not a lot of room for deep dives. I’ll list a few main points that felt the most substantial and differentiating between Wonderlands and Borderlands to me.
[list]
[*]For the first time in the series there is a character creation system. It’s not the most in-depth, yet not exactly simplistic either. You may create a standard fantasy knight, as well as sculpt some monstrosity of various degrees of freakishness. Due to this, the main character(s) have lost some of their identity. The vault hunters you could choose in the previous games of the series still had some sort of unique character or personality traits after all. And here you play as a non-charismatic, but at least customizable character. Whatever floats your boat, I guess.
 
[*]The quality of the loot drops now depends on the number of discovered Lucky Dices in the given location. This feature is inherently controversial, especially seeing how drastically it affected the traditional loot drop system. The logic is clear: the more you explore the map – the more Lucky Dices you get as a reward for that, and as a result your chances of high-tier loot drops increase. However, why the fuсk would you fix something that ain’t broke? If you’ll excuse my language. Was this change really necessary? Not quite, imo. Definitely not cool. Seeing green and blue drops as a reward for a sweaty (boss) fight is not an amazing or Borderlands-esque sight to behold.
 
[*]There are no vehicles in the game. However, I haven’t encountered any problems with the traversal in my playthrough. There’s plenty of fast travel stations and the maps aren’t that large either.
 
[*]Melee combat has been taken to the next level: there’s a separate melee weapon slot now + a few passive and active abilities. Overall, I see it as a welcome change. It especially goes well with the Brr-zerker class – the one I picked up at the start.
 
[*]Speaking of which, there’s only one branch of abilities the players can choose within the class. However, later on in the game you’ll be able to acquire another class on top of your main one, therefore creating a mixed character. Stabbomancer was a great pairing for Brr-zerker. This multiclass allowed the new melee system to shine and showcased its true potential.
 
[*]As for gunplay, here we’re dealing with a cut down version of Borderlands 3 in terms of weapon variety. All in all, on a mechanical level alone, it has remained unchanged. The first few hours might mislead you into believing that the crossbows are the only weapon type you’ll be using. However, just a couple of hours later the traditional weapon assortment will fill up your inventory.

[b]Yes, they have sold us virtually the same game once again. But I can’t condemn the developers for this, as the excellent core of Borderlands 3 is difficult to botch, even though they tried to do so by adding Lucky Dices. Despite all of that, overall it’s still a wonderful co-op looter shooter with a few new features and implementations.[/b]

I'm iffy on certain aspects, like random critical hits and the multiclassing, but other aspects, like turning melee weapons into their own class of gear, or the addition of spells, were very good. I hope melee weapons as collectible gear becomes a mainstay of future installments.

pretty fun to play, theres a lot of room for creativity in the way that every class has their own unique skill tree, so with multiclassing you can fuse any two skill trees in the game for some cool combinations

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a game that thinks its giving fans more of what they want. Take a popular Borderlands 2 DLC add more absurd non-sequitur dialogue and characters, repeat the fantasy background, with its D&D trappings, make the maps bigger, add some dice rolls and voila you get this predictable, painfully formulaic, forgettable game that forgets to ask where exactly is the fun in any of it?

[h1]The Good:[/h1]

[i][u]Gameplay:[/u][/i]
The new mechanics of spell casting and unique class abilities are genuinely a solid improvement to the gameplay experience from previous borderlands games. Additionally some of the purple and gold weapons are innovative in their combat mechanics and fun to play with (however they are few and far between leaving you more often with a banal weapon going experience).

[h1]The Bad:[/h1]

[i][u]Loot[/u][/i]
How do you make a looter shooter with bad loot? Easy. Have terrible drop rates for any loot you would actually want to keep. Wonderlands has - by far - the worst drop rates of any modern Borderlands game (BL2 or later, I honestly can't remember the drop rates in BL1). I did not see anything but low level whites and greens for the first 10levels. Blues dropped like purples from other Borderlands games until I was past level 20. This is likely due to the 'loot luck' system Tiny Tina employees where you have to run around the maps and do challenges to find hidden dice to 'raise your loot luck.' If you stick with the default 'loot luck,' you will have an extremely unrewarding experience. 

The developers have said they want gold drops in Wonderlands to 'feel special,' 'rewarding,' etc. What they've actually done is make the game feel unrewarding to play. It is not hyperbolic to say I did not see a gold drop until I was 20+hrs into the game and over level 20 (the cap is level 40). I did not see my first gold weapon drop until level 22 - which was immediately pointless as it was a 1-shot shotgun that had to be reloaded every time you fire. This was not a weapon that suits my play style so instead of 'feeling special' or 'rewarding' what it actually felt like was trolling from the game. It was not until I was around lvl30 I found another gold weapon drop, fortunately the 2nd time around it turned out to be worth playing with.  But this experience begs the question why do the developers think spacing gold drops so absurdly few and far between creates an exciting or rewarding game-play experience? It simply doesn't. And I say this as someone with 800+ hrs in Borderlands 2 and 400+ in both the Pre-Sequel and BL3. Initially when playing BL3 I thought the gold drops were a bit too generous but after playing Wonderlands I would far prefer a game lean on being overly generous than end up as stingy as Wonderlands is.

[i][u]Story[/u][/i]
Like Borderlands 3, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands turns up the level of absurd non-sequitur one-liner humor to 11 with the same cringe results. The lesson none of the Borderlands writers seem capable of assimilating into their work is that however big or broad the humor may want to be - fundamentally - the story and the character's desires need to be based on something real. As an example, part of the humor of the original Borderlands 2 Tiny Tina DLC comes from Mr. Torgue who wanted to be accepted and allowed to play a game of D&D even though he seems like a poor fit given his jock-ish appearance. The broad, over the top humor in that scenario was still grounded by a reality for each of the characters. 

While the voice acting in Wonderlands is largely serviceable none of the characters are memorable (unlike any of the BL2 characters). What's worse is one of the main characters, played by Wanda Sykes (who I normally love) phoned in her performance. She gives the most wooden, and stilted dialogue in the game.  Finally, the ending of Wonderlands' story is perfectly serviceable however the moment to moment journey is not something you'll likely pay much attention to undermining most of your time with it.

[i][u]Exploration & Gameplay[/u][/i]
2 new additions to Wonderlands is the D&D inspired overworld map & the larger map zones (sans vehicles) filled with challenges, collectibles etc. The problem with both of these additions is the lack of immersion and exhaustion they create. Previous Borderlands games typically had zones that could be cleared in a play session of an hour or so. These larger maps will exhaust you if you try to clear the side quests in one go never mind the challenges. Fundamentally it is a problem of proper pacing which takes you out of the game and makes the experience into a grindy checklist. None of the quests or dialogue is that memorable or compelling so everything sinks to the lowest common denominator of feeling like a fetch quest. The maps themselves are too homogeneous. If its a shipwreck map everything fits the aesthetic of a shipwreck, if it's a bean stock then it's all vines and floating rocks etc etc. Part of the reason a player wants to explore something is to come across the unexpected. With every map in Wonderlands showing you exactly what it is from the start - why would you really be that invested in seeing what's around the next corner? 

The over-world map that's added on the surface feels like a welcome new addition, a chance to experiment with a new idea etc. Unfortunately it quickly devolves into a nuisance that takes you away from the more compelling game play elements that typify a normal borderlands game. 

[i][u]Technical[/u][/i]
Wonderlands is supposed to be a kind of re-skin of BL3 so I have no idea why the performance is so much worse for me. Frame rates are noticeably worse in Wonderlands than in BL3. Texture pop-ins are noticeable and common. The same lack of attention to detail you see in the lack of character avatars that aren't shown in-game when someone is speaking seems to pertain to what is under the hood of the game as well. Wonderlands is far from the days of BL2 - a light weight game which could run on almost every potato PC.

[h1]Bottom Line:[/h1]

As someone with literally over 1k hours in all of the previous Borderlands games and only 50ish hours in this one (at the time of review) I can honestly say I will not be spending much more time with this game. Gearbox has really hit a wall in my mind with the latest 2 borderlands games. Instead of creating more immersive and memorable environments, characters, and compelling game play elements they seem content with retreading familiar ground to the point of nausea and headache. Even on Sale, Wonderlands is not worth your time.

The base game's story is fun to play through as it's just long enough and doesn't drag on as much as BL3's did. If you try to do all sidequests as they pop up and explore the maps for lucky dice it feels like a proper adventure. Player customization is also more varied this time around as you make your own character and pick a class. You can make some very ugly characters, me and my friend played as a goblin and orc for example.

The issue is that the base game doesn't have anything to do aside from 100%ing the maps and finishing the story. The endgame feels unbalanced, builds feel like a step down from any previous borderlands game except 1, there aren't any fun farms or exciting equipment to strive towards. The game had potential, but the devs squandered it by rushing out short, shitty, overpriced DLCs and not adding more content to the main game as they did with cartels and takedowns in BL3.

Basically, just get it on sale and play the story in co-op if you like borderlands games. It's more of the same but not enough for a full game with this pricetag.",1694815833,1694815833,False,1,0,0.522613048553466797,0,True,False,False

It contains an arena system that is fun with friends, however after one or two hours of play, you will exhaust most of the variety available. 

Overall, a fun game, I would absolutely recommend it, even at full price. That being said, expect your unique experience to end and your wonder to fade within 20 hours of play.

Granted I'm a 47 year old man and I'm quite sure that I'm not the target audience for this game.  I played all the Borderlands games and like most things about most of those games.  But this is just too much.  It's like Borderlands for 10 year old girls with ADHD.  The stories/plots are boring and uninteresting.  I find myself not caring at all about what is happening in the game.  The quests are really quick/short and it's always ""go to this place and kill a few easy enemies and then go back to the quest giver and turn it in"".  I'm tired or sleepy sometimes at night after a long day of work and I find myself almost falling asleep playing this game because it doesn't make me think at all and it's just plain boring.  The colors are a bit too much and half the time it hurts my eyes playing this.  The gun play is OK but not nearly as good as Borderlands games.  I don't really like the whole magic thing.  It's difficult to tell what a lot of the items even do.  But the guns aren't nearly as good or as fun as in Borderlands.  The enemies seem dumbed down and easier to kill and therefore the gear is toned down too.  I'm only about level 15 but I find myself barely wanting to continue playing this and I may never finish it.  Too bad since I'm pretty sure I spent decent money on it. I'm glad I paid nothing close to full price however.  I think I'd choose a refund if that was a possibility.  I'm sure there are some other games out right now that I'd rather play than this one.  I just find right now is a really bad time for the video game industry as a whole.  It seems like all the people who worked from home barely worked and the games coming out now are rushed and half-done, or just not good period.

 I appreciate the fact that when you beat the game, the game acknowledges you cleared it and you can choose to proceed with clearing side missions in Chapter 11 Epilogue, which is just an endless chapter meant for you to keep playing. Unsure if I would keep playing just to clear side missions, but overall I had a pretty good time with it. I'd probably rank it 7.5/10.

EDIT: Thought of some more. Really liked how character customization works. Loot drops could be better (you reach a point where you're better off buying gear from a shop, cause the drops are mostly not worth it).

It's a neat picture into what a sequel could be like, and is a decent romp that borderlands players will probably enjoy, but the lack of existing characters and personalities (save for tina and 2 other short cameos) as well as just being a hodgepodge of various ideas tossed together keeps this from being great.",1694490901,1694490901,True,1,0,0.515325665473937988,0,True,False,False

Combat is that of BL3 but tweaked and refined making a better game play experience, unfortunately the anointed system makes a unwanted return making getting the gear you want tedious instead of fun. Which leads to the lack off dedicated drops, just like BL3. Most gear is tied to world drops, yet again making building your ""Fatemaker"" boring and long-winded.

The UI is yet again appalling. Gearbox had a fantastic UI for BL2 and BL;TPS worked like a dream for keyboard and mouse, and controller alike. But since BL3 the UI has been god awful for comparing gear and inventory management. 

Finally the DLC. What the actual fuck were they thinking. the content they seem to be discharging from their asses should just be free updates as they are just glorified chaos chambers.

There is nothing particularly great about the game, it's just more Borderlands in a different skin.

I've never played more boring Borderlands game ever in my life. Don't be like me and only buy it when there is a huge sale.

Everything and I mean EVERYTHING is boring. The weapons are boring, main quests are boring, side quests are boring, skills are boring, visuals are boring. Same old boring borderlands humor, same old boring characters, heck even the same old sounds and UI. Everything is boring to the very end. There is not even a single change that makes this game any different than BL3. You have melee weapons instead of melee attack, you have spells instead of grenades. WOW HOW UNIQUE.

I should have refunded instantly instead of giving it a second chance and passing the 2 hour limit.

Only buy it on full price if you're totally new to the entire Borderlands franchise. Otherwise, see above.

1 Year later edit: I barely found the will to complete the story. I speed ran most of the bosses and used a ""trainer"" to defeat the last boss. Also disabled all the dialogues by modifying the game files to be able to at least play without getting constant interruptions.

Story is better than BL3 but the length of it is the problem. It’s quite short. Health of bosses is still low and they die faster than we would like. Also, there is no good endgame content. Loot is absolutely ruined and graphics doesn’t look better. Perhaps it looks a little worse than BL3. This game is ok. It can be interesting expirience and funny at some times. But I would still recommend playing Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep.

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands was a game I was very hyped for upon its announcement after playing the hell out of Borderlands 2. I love Dungeons and Dragons and fantasy settings, so seeing a looter shooter from Gearbox set in a fantasy world with Tina herself as the dungeon master? I said count me the hell in! I love Tina as a character, she's whimsical and funny and the right amount of crazy. Her voice actress is phenomenal, I love how she's brought Tina to life over the years.

Going into gameplay, it's your typical borderlands looter-shooter. You kill tons of enemies, get loot, sell it (a lot) and optionally spend time grinding bosses for the specific loot you want. Nothing about the gameplay loop has changed here in that regard, but the class system brings a refreshing take in Wonderlands. I like the idea of mixing and matching the equally great classes in this game. I started the game as a spellshot/graveborn, and finished it on a second character as a sporewarden/clawbringer (love my little buddies.) The abilities they have and the trees you spec into are great, it's fun and varied. Take note of that second playthrough, though.

As for story, it's hit or miss for some. I enjoyed what I got out of it, for the most part, but the ending was very very rushed. There was a buildup and suddenly you are being ushered to the final fight. Despite my playtime, the game is WICKEDLY short if you avoid the side quests (more on that later, too.) Because of this, I hate to say it, but DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE. It's sad to scream that, but this game simply does not have the content to justify $60. At best, it's a $30 game, so pick it up on sale. It's worth a playthrough, yes, but definitely on sale.

Okay, now to the nitty-gritty. Look, just...don't bother with most of the side quests. There's really only a few that I enjoyed, those specifically being: Walk The Stalk (Though it overstays its welcome), Little Boys Blue, Lyre and Brimstone, Inner Daemons, Goblins Tired of Forced Oppression, Trial of Crooked-Eye Phil, A Walk To Dismember, and A Wandering Aye. There are more quests in the later game areas but I honestly didn't bother touching them at all because of one thing: MOST QUESTS IN THIS GAME ARE FETCH QUESTS. I despise fetch quests, and Wonderlands is laden with them. 90% of the time you pick up a side quest, it's to go get something for someone and bring it back. That's it.

I mentioned a second playthrough, and that's because I gave up on my first one simply because of the overabundance of these lame fetch quests that were never worth the reward. I was level 32, made it to the third area of the game and just realized, sitting there, I wasn't having much fun outside of the main story. When it comes to Borderlands games, I LOVE the sidequests. They're engaging and have fun objectives and dialogue. This game's sidequests are just the same thing over and over and over again and I got really tired of it quickly. It killed the fun I was having running around and killing things because you'd go into a marked dungeon, clear waves of enemies across several rooms, get the item you need in a chest, dip out, and go back to the quest giver.

The primary reason I came back to Wonderlands and finished it at all, honestly, is because I'm clearing my backlog while waiting for Lies of P. In the end, I am glad I finished it because the main story is fun, but outside of it, very little else is.

So...there you have it. My probably spicy take on Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. Do I recommend it in the end? Yes, with an asterisk. Get it on a BIG sale, look up the worthwhile sidequests ahead of time, and stick your guns to the main story.",1693767381,1693767381,True,0,0,0.489251285791397095,0,True,False,False

And to be honest, I do not play it clean because I edit my saves. My general opinion in games is FUCC RANDOM LOOT WITH NO CRAFTING and always ""fix"" it this when possible. Note that I play only solo with crafted gear.

I use save editor to craft equipment by transferring parts and traits from one stuff to another following my own set of rules for crafting, and also generation logic that allows gear to exist in the game. When a part or a trait is transferred, the gear from which the trait is transferred is deleted. This includes, level, rarity, parts etc. Single step advancement. One trait at a time. Traits only within the same class and vendor. In other words, parts or traits only from Skuldigger AR to another Skuldigger AR. Same part type replaces the old one if present and no duplication allowed, even if the generation logic allows it (hilariously, one gun can have 2 different overlapping barrel types and work in the game). Multiple part transfer is only allowed for legendaries and uniques as they sometimes have a part set they need to have for generation logic to allow them to be remade.

This allows me to actually fully explore the possibilities of the weapon classes and their vendors, and also discover genius hidden part combinations that do insane things that I would never discover in this game with how it is designed by default.
And this actually makes me more engaged into analyzing the equipment that might look useless at first glance, but actually has one awesome detail that is overshadowed by it's comparative uselessness to something of higher rarity or having some other better metric.

Playing one fight for 1 million times just to get a non craftable and non customizable randomized equipment I want with good part combination is FORCED REPLAYABILITY mechanic made to milk playtime hours and makes the game pointlessly boring and repeatable.

This is a scummy mechanic is made to ""encourage"" the player to waste more time into the game by making ideal result more difficult to attain. This is not making the game more enjoyable, it just makes it longer and less rewarding to put time into.

Weapon crafting through the save edit can create some miraculous, amazing and hilarious stuff. 
If it was implemented in the core game, the game would be fantastic and far more appealing for just exploring and finding the perfect piece to complete an absolute masterpiece of a perfect gun. Or even different variations of perfect guns of the same class and vendor.

Even some of the best legendary weapons become just shiny trinkets that look cool compared to the insane crafted builds.

Too bad the real crafting will NEVER be implemented in this franchise as the developers are more concerned with BEING WOKE AS FUCC and forcing the players to waste time on clutter mechanics to steal player time.",1693581650,1693581650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Which means you’ll be collecting a lot of randomly generated guns and comparing stats. Some are going to have aspects that aren’t clear until you try and use them, like bad sights, or excessive recoil, or a weird shot pattern that makes them useless at anything but short range or against huge targets.

There are 6 character classes, plus one unlocked via DLC. Each only has one skill tree, where prior games had 3, but you eventually get to choose an additional class, so there’s a wide variety of mix-and-match. Skill effects are very gradual, so it takes a lot of progression down a tree before the class feels at all different from the generic shooting that all classes do.

In addition to guns, there are spells. Which feel like the guns with the various random attributes, though some do things that guns don’t, like spawn hydra heads that act like turrets. Some classes do better with spells than others.

The fantasy setting means the environments are much more varied than the typical Borderlands game. There are several large zones, and they’re all maze-like enough that they’re confusing to navigate, even while referencing the map.

There are a bunch of smaller maps for random encounters / pocket dungeons. Most are like Doom-style death match arenas, moderately complex rather than the simple open spaces of arenas in older Borderlands games, but still somewhat smalll overall.

Combat balance isn’t really to my liking. Lots of enemies like to close to melee range, and a fair number of the later game enemies can teleport to do so. Random encounters / pocket dungeons will outright spawn enemies behind you. This makes the game chaotic rather than tactical, it’s often a matter of holing up in a corner and shooting enemies as they charge, or running around like mad. 

Not once did I find a situation where using a rocket launcher made sense. I used spells for big area of effect attacks, because I could have both a spell and a regular, fast-firing single target gun equipped at the same time.

I enjoyed the side-quests a lot more than the main story. The conceit is that it’s a tabletop RPG with a manic 13 year old as a game master, so everything is intentionally silly and juvenile. This works for the side quests that are generally pop-culture parodies of games and movies, but it also means the main quest feels pretty shallow.

One aspect of the main quest I really disliked was that the main villain has a mind of his own, and is rebelling against Tina as game master. Which doesn’t make any sense, really, and his complaints about her “tyranny” ring hollow, since it’s explicitly a game. I think Wonderlands would have been better, overall, if they’d skipped that and stuck with the idea that he’s an NPC played by Tina, like the rest of the major NPCs.

Overall, it’s pretty good. It took me a while to warm to it at first, but eventually I adapted to the vibe.",1693405107,1693405107,True,89,0,0.863842129707336426,0,True,False,False

The outlandish Borderlands weapons actually seem to be more at home in this fantasy D&D setting than in the original games. The cartoonish look fits fantasy much better than a sci-fi shooter, and so do the weird creatures and monsters. Classes and abilities are made for this kind of game. 

Humor is mostly good again (especially after some cringeworthy humor of some previous games and DLCs), with many pokes at pop culture, other games and of course, itself. The main opponent is smart and actually knows what he's doing (as opposed to the super annoying opponents in Borderlands 3).

The story isn't its strong point at all, way too stretched out (even kind of trying to give you a reason for this choice within the game) and just not that entertaining. The main characters are enjoyable at least, and the villain is better than Borderland 3 's. 

Side quests are often just boring, none of them are that funny or entertaining, personally cleared them just for completition. Weirdly enough for the kind of game it is, it has quite a few quests that takes themselves really seriously.

[b]Things I liked in Wonderlands[/b]
[list]
[*]it has little to none connection with previous Borderlands
Set in a medieval kingdom, the story steers away from Pandora (finally!). There are still familiar faces giving your quests (Torgue, Claptrap, Brick), but they are so subtle or just hilarious. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2907628326
[*]Atmosphere
Sunny and chill. Mini board POV in-between worlds and bright levels (with few dark story levels) - all that makes you want to play more. There are dices to collect (well hidden or guarded), which boost your stats.
[*]Spells > Grenades
Instead of explosives, your character snaps fingers, summons creatures, throws fireballs or intensively waves magic wands.
Then your enemies are either being hit by lightening, bounce off jelly cubes or being chased by tiny hydra snakes. Fun times!
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3024025544
[*]Character customization
A lot of options to create your hero, starting with class and body type, finishing with nose shapes, hairdos and armour patterns. [/list]

[b]What I didn't enjoy[/b]
[list]
[*]Enemies. It's mostly skeletons. 
Somehow they are everywhere. Every second mission has skeletons. Major rescue quest features skeletons, their ghost ship, which was fun, but at that point I fed up with them.
Of course there are other types - sentient mushrooms, goblins, dragons, yuan-ti, sharks... but it's mainly skeletons.
[*]Only a few bosses.
1-2 interesting and real giant beasts to kill. There are more in the trial chambers.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3024026239
[*]Loot can be a bitch. 
At some point you can select a subclass. This is where RNG will go wild. Constantly generating half of your main and half of another warrior. Shame.

Back when it was announced late 2021 - early 2022, I was sceptical: a new BL game to come out only a few years after the latest installment? During the Schmovid Schmandemic no less? I had a gut feeling that it wouldn't be that great, so I tampered my enthousiasm and held off of it for a while.

But that has passed, obviously, and I have given it a chance. So, what do I think after my first playthrough? Here are some of my personal thoughts and reflections

[h1]The good[/h1]
[list]
[*] Absolutely stunning visuals,  The maps and environments have received a lot of attention and their diversity is rich, and the same can generally be said about the enemies as well.
[*] I enjoyed the writing in this game A LOT more than that of BL3. Our villain is maybe no Handsome Jack, but I found him a lot more interesting and more fleshed out than others in the series. The humor goes a bit more back to the older games in the franchise. And the player is once again the center point in the story and its driving force, a stark contrast with BL3 wherein your achievements often felt futile and your presence ignored.
[*] The more complex Character Creation is awesome (you can even choose your spoken voice), you can create some real beauties with it. 
[*] The general reflavor of loot to match the fantasy setting more is a nice touch: spells instead of grenades, armor (that can substantially change your appearance) instead of classmods, crossbow rifles,... and the introduction of melee weapons are fun additions, but it is done so that it still feels perfectly like Borderlands.
[*] Once again a TON of references to be found. This game has some of my all-time favorite side quests
[/list]


[h2]The bad:[/h2]
[list]
[*] a level cap of 40, for some reason, despite the fact that every BL game before went to at least 50 AND had ways to increase it. And the Myth Rank system (comparable to Badass Rank in earlier games) is horribly barebones. Why did they decide to take a step back from the far superior system implemented in BL3, the game that was the blueprint for this one?
[*] speaking of a step back from BL3: they kept the mantling and climbing, but added a metric crapton of invisible walls and ledges that LOOK mountable but are not. In a game series that rewards players for map exploration, this feels like a slap in the face.
[*] the endgame does not appeal to me. The Chaos chamber is fun for a few times but it gets repetitive pretty quickly. And even if you enjoy the gauntlet and get some top-tier gear, then what? Test it out in a Takedown or on a Raid Boss? Sorry, no can do. There are seemingly also no returning Seasonal Events, like the Cartel or Captain Haunt in BL3 (which you can now toggle on and off whenever you wish btw).
[*] the lack of vehicles and the relatively low amount of travel stations make the maps often a slog to navigate through
[*] the balance of the loots feels all over the place
[/list]

Overal, it is a very colourful BL game that nails the aestetic and has a lot of content early and midgame, but in many ways it does things worse than its predecessors. It feels rushed, even more than after its release. I don't think I would recommend it for full price, but 40 or lower? Absolutely",1692543883,1692544034,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

. DLC is only repeatable dungeons

Opinion: 

Honestly If i went back to play the DLC for Borerlands 2 that this game is inspired from. I'd say I would play that. However, when playing this. I'd say don't treat this as a Borderlands game per say. this is a great spin off and really shows something unique and different from your run of the mill franchise. 

""Would you play this again?""
Yes I would, I admit I get a few good laughs in this and I think this game can be fun, despite missing more content.

With that said, IF you are reading this Gearbox Devs. If you are thinking about adding more to this. just do it. see what the public wants and thinks. All that this game is missing is endgame content or a BIG DLC addon that will make this a worthwhile game to the collection. that's all it needs.",1692373613,1692373613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Wonderlands, however, don't have the advantage to be a DLC of a great base game. It's just random and tries hard to be funny with recycled old characters. 
It's not a bad game, the gameplay is smooth and fast-paced. (Unless in Overworld. Navigating it was a drag.) 
Guns and spells are satisfyingly destructive and satisfyingly varied – at first. Then, however, nearing the endgame I just gave up and used the same type of SMG's (Hyperion and Dahl) with different status effects because it didn't make sense to play with anything else – they simply had the best DPS.
Classes aren't very appealing, they all kind of blend together. Adding skill points makes no noticeable change in gameplay, you don't feel empowered like in the previous installments.

Grinding out bosses for their drops does not feel worth it at all. 

The loot luck system makes sense but even with being max level, all lucky dice found, and wearing luck up gear the drop rate for items still average around 6% maxed. When you play with my rng that's around 30-40 runs to get a single drop of what you are looking for. Not worth. 

Overall though I had fun. Got the game on a heavy sale which is the only way to do it. 

Would I play this game again? By myself? Not a chance. With a friend? Maybe.

The game is set on the D&D universe, with a new overworld ""area"" where you travel from location to location unlocking new parts of the map, get some side quests and other stuff, like shrines that gives you buffs to your character stats.
I enjoyed the story, it was  ok, there are some really funny side quests, and the overworld adds a new flavor to the game.
The part where this game really shines is on the weapons department, there are tons of fun crazy weapons to try out and have fun with, they all feel great to shoot and just feel nice use.
I didn't really like the amount of loot you get , it's just too much, usually just trash loot you are not going to use, you can still it sell it on the vending machines sure, but i still think it would have been nice to get less trash loot and more good loot.

This game is not worth the full price, the main story is a bit bland and simple and not memorable.
Some dialog is funny but overall they try too hard and you spend rolling your eyes as a lot. 

The game play itself is also a bland, while you are able to multi-class in several classes and combine abilities in your build it doesn't add much to the game play.
For a looter shooter you really have to search for the enemies as they are spread thin around the map which is really a hassle and breaking the flow of the game play.
The normal game mode is so easy and it is boring even on the highest difficulty.
The endgame is a boring repetitive grind which makes the game a tad harder every time you complete a special level as in... the enemies become bullet sponges so not much interesting there.
There is no replay value in this game and you can't start a new game+ as you might be familiar with in the normal Borderlands games.

If you want a fun game go play Borderlands 2, and try the Tina DLC there because that's just so much more fun than this boring and bland game.

Also some decisions I cannot understand
Multiplayer player names are way too big.
The fasttravel system was way better in Borderlands 3, you have to walk way more. In Addition to that, the map feels kinda worse to move around.
The Encounters are just boring and annoying and seem to just be there, to artificially inflate the game length.

The biggest gripe for me was the gameplay loop. Having to switch between the main hub, the table top map, and the encounters was annoying; each forces you into half a 15s loading screen. 

You do a main quest dungeon, then you have to grind out a bunch of encounters to progress. 
These encounters a series of maps You finish certain waves of mobs in a map, take a portal with 15s loading screen to another map, rinse and repeat ~5 times until the encounter is finish. Maps and mobs are reused and look so... uninspiring to say the least.

HOWEVER, I've played Borderlands 1, 2, Pre-Sequel, 3, and numerous DLCs with my wife. We've enjoyed them immensely, mainly because the co-op experience was either good or at least satisfactory. This installment made it nearly unplayable for us due to one significant change from the other games in this series: players earn more experience points (EP) for delivering the finishing blow. Over time, the level/EP disparity between my wife and me grew so substantial that I had to intentionally hold back, which reduced my enjoyment. From levels 10 to 40, I found myself merely running into every battle, hoping my pet wouldn't defeat the enemies, and allowing my wife to finish them off. It became incredibly frustrating to just watch her engage in combat while I still had a considerable EP lead, regardless of our efforts to balance it. My uncontrollable pet often dealt the killing blows, and my main objective became avoiding enemy kills. The thrill of acquiring and using powerful weapons vanished because what was the point? I constantly felt unsatisfied and powerless.

Why introduce such a mechanic in co-op? It would be more suitable for a ""competition"" mode or something similar. Co-op players should have the freedom to choose whether they want a level difference or not.

Overall, it was a disheartening experience. The only solace came from the humorous dialogues between battles. Each encounter was pure frustration, and we won't be revisiting this game. For context, we've replayed BL1, 2, Pre-Sequel, and 3 multiple times, amassing over 3,000 hours of gameplay combined.

Very disapointing!!!

PS: Yes, we googled and tried a lot of things to get rid of the EP difference. But after 2-3 fights I had (thanks to the pet) again an enormous EP advantage!",1691337361,1691337361,False,214,11,0.82022625207901001,8,True,False,False

While it keeps a lot of the things we associate with the borderlands franchise, the game also removes some of the core elements. 

In this game, there are no premade characters to choose from, instead you choose your own stats and design of your character. This feels very natural since this game is Borderlands meets Dungeons and Dragons. Building on this concept, the game introduces its own ""tabletop rpg board"" called: ""Overworld"". 

The Overworld works as transportation between zones, but also offers quests of its own and things to collect. Here the game introduces the very interesting need to complete one quest, in order to unlock a new path that allows you to finish a previous quest. Unfortunately, the content in the Overworld can get very repetitive and I recommend completing it in between main missions. 

The story is not the main selling point of the game, but then again, that's not really the selling point of any borderlands game. What we do come back for is, in my opinion; fun gameplay and fun dialogue. The gameplay is great, capturing that fantasy/DnD setting by, for example, replacing grenades with spells feels so spot on. The dialog and humor in borderlands is its own thing, being very silly, stupid and sometimes a little cringe. In Borderlands 3 a lot of players, myself included, felt that the characters and dialogue were just too cringe to enjoy. I want to make the claim that they have reversed that and I much more enjoy the conversations in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. And as a big fan of Brooklyn 99, having Andy Samberg voice one of the main characters is a blast. 

In conclusion; this game is not just another Borderlands game. The pacing is sometimes slower and some core ideas of all previous Borderlands games are gone. It's best enjoyed if you have some experience playing Dnd, but definitely not a necessity. It improves dialog compared to Borderlands 3, but unfortunately keeps it's difficult to navigate map.

The areas you fight at are not great either, for some reason every spot you fight at feels like a [i]Arena[/i] of sorts and not a good designed one.

The AI feels off with enemies sometimes just running between two places if the player is not close enough, feels worse sometimes then Far Cry 6 AI.

Another negative thing for me is that Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is not even 30 hours long, including all the DLC... for a game they charge $79.99 for. Compared you get allot more bang for your buck if you buy Borderlands 3: Super Deluxe Edition you get more content for the same price.

[h1]Full Review:[/h1]

Fun game! I wanted to review the game being a long time fan of the Borderlands series. I'm a bit late to the party, as I was busy with other games at the time, but I picked the game up on sale recently, and I'm pleasantly suprised!

First off, thankfully the writing is not too bad, definitely an improvement over Borderlands 3 (not as good as Borderlands 2, but that's fine given this is a DnD side story based on a DLC). Granted, while Borderlands has never been the best example of good writing in games, I feel many would agree the drop in quality from BL2 > BL3 was very disappointing. The BL3 writing definitely soured the opinion of many who played BL3 despite it's fun gameplay and vast endgame content. 

The gameplay is just as fun as BL3, with some fun twists. You now can mix and match 2 classes, with the option to reroll your 2nd class freely (after a certain point in the game), grenades are now replaced with spells (they recharge on a timer), and there are now melee weapons with unique effects. It's different enough to feel the fantasy element while still having many of the elements that make Borderlands so fun.

However, the main story of the game feels very short compared to the other Borderlands Games (My first playthrough which played mostly only the main story finished the game at level 26 in around 13-14 hours), so I would recommend you to play and explore many of the side quests on your first playthrough if you want to enjoy your first playthrough. Side quests aren't mind blowing or anything, but are fun and entertaining enough to help with the short length of the main story. 

There's also a mod called Wonderlands Redux found on Nexus that improves some gameplay aspects that some may want to install, so check it out and see if it interests you. If you plan to play the endgame, I would encourage you to download it as it makes the endgame much, much better. Either play install it on your first playthrough, or play through the game once in vanilla and then endgame with Redux, either works IMO, it's up to you to decide. (If you plan to play Redux's endgame content, you pretty much need the DLC, so keep that in mind).

Some notable additions in the Redux mod include: 
- Fun movement options (double jump, air dash, improved slide momentum, etc.)
- Unlocks/skips/changes game mechanics that players may find tedious/annoying (starts the game with all 4 weapons slots, chaos level is now capped at 10 instead of 100, unique gear now have their own rarity and are easier to identify, etc)
- Pearlescent Rarity, along with Legacy Hunts (think Legendary Hunts from BL3)

Overall, the game is very fun, and unlike with BL3, there is no major flaw in the game that would make me iffy about playing this title (Seriously, the writing in BL3 was very hard to stomach). It's fun solo or with friends, and is an enjoyable entry in the series.

My only real big complaint is the pricing of the game. It feels a bit short for a $60 title. IMO, it feels more like it should be $40, especially since there's no TVHM like the older games. Chaos runs are fun but aren't the same as THVM, and IMO I feel it provides less replay value compared to TVHM. Add this to how short the main story feels, the game definitely can feel a bit lacking in content compared to the previous games. 

The game seems to go on sale for about $20 with the Chaotic Great Edition (Game + DLC Bundle) going for $26, so I would definitely recommend waiting for a sale if you can, as I would only buy the game at full price if you really, really, really love Borderlands and must play it despite its short length and lower replay value compared to the previous Borderlands entries.

Again, if you plan to play the game's endgame, I would recommend getting the DLC and highly encourage the Redux mod (buy the DLC on sale, the $30 Season's Pass isn't worth it IMO). Otherwise, if you only plan to play the game's main/side content, you can skip the DLC.",1691180146,1691180857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS:
- Some awesome side stories that allow for more cool boss battles and loot
- Super cool villain almost as good as Jack from BL2 in my opinion
- Game play is nice and smooth I feel like i'm an action hero from an 80's movie   
- The world is very fleshed out and very pretty looking  
- The over world is a cool new feature that gets rid of the pointless driving from the last games
- The character customization is great 
CONS:
- The end game is very lacking and the end game that is there isn't really fun
- The legendary weapons in this game are very bad and feel very weak
- Lack of enemy variety 
- The music doesn't hit as good as the last games
- The skill trees are kinda bad and boring 
- The DLC's are dog trash and should be burned 
Summary:
I would give this game a shot if you are a fan of looter shooters but wait for a big sale. I had a lot of fun but grew very bored after I beat the game due to the bad state of the end game.

Wonderlands fixes Borderlands 3's greatest flaw: story and characters. Along with that, it brings some genuinely worthwhile content and gameplay elements, however, it's still a reskin, and, essentially, nothing we haven't seen before.

[b]The Good:[/b]

- The Story and Characters are great. Tina is amazing as Bunker Master and I loved every single voiceline she screamed in my ears; Valentine, Frette and the Dragonlord are also funny and expertly voiced, even if sometimes it might feel a little bit too much.

- The World varies from beatiful to simply breathtaking. Even if they're just shotting arenas for us players, you can tell that a lot of work has been put to differentiate each and every setting in this D&D campaign - from pirate coves to desert temples, from snowy mountain peaks to giant beanstalks, every corner of this map looks amazing.

- The Classes also let the player mix and match tons of builds by combining two of them at once, fiddling around with your skills and gear to make the perfect build; this (along with the combat and loot) has always been the franchise's main selling point, and this time is no different. Oh, spells are amazing too.

- The customization is actually one of Wonderlands' best features, we don't spend a lot of time looking at our characters, but I really enjoyed messing around with all the options at our disposal here.

[b]The Bad:[/b]

- It's just more Borderlands. The quests can have as much window dressing and dialogue as they want, this is too similar to Borderlands 3 and I started to get bored halfway through; your mileage may vary, but Borderlands 4 NEEDS to bring something new to the table.

- The UI. For the love of all that is holy, change this UI. It was already terrible in 3, and there's no excuse for it to keep being this terrible in Wonderlands, it's confusing, buggy and frustating to use.

- The optimization is still as bad as it was on 3; just goes to show, again, how little time was invested in making the game actually differ from it's predecessor. 

- Who the hell thought loot luck, one of the most (if not THE most) important stats in a looter shooter should be based on over 200 little collectible dice scattered throughout the map with NO map markers for them?

[b]THE UGLY:[/b]

- The monetization, ""DLC"" and late game content are the reason why I'm leaving a negative review. By now, you probably noticed the review score for the Season Pass that Wonderlands offers.

The ""DLC"" are 4 separate ""dungeons"" that straight up reutilize the base game's arenas over and over, there's no story (the 30 seconds cutscene before you start the dungeon doesn't count), no unique, exciting loot waiting for you as a reward for beating the boss, nothing. It's a pathetic excuse for a DLC for a game that, by itself, IS a DLC; trust me, with the money they're asking for this game you can buy at least a few copies of Borderlands 3's Ultimate Edition (which also has a shitty ""Season Pass 2"", but that's another discussion). There's no endgame content. 

Gearbox is getting way to greedy and way too comfortable with this franchise, and I hope Borderlands 4 can inovate and somehow surprise us.",1690333946,1690333946,False,2,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

I've never seen a legend appear in a machine.
A loot dice rolling a 20 has never given me a legendary, and ironically rolling 1's has given me better loot.
Borderlands 3 was too rewarding, this game seems to forget that it needed to reward you. Side quests on the other hand always seem to have at least a blue with red text.

Some bugs persist, such as netcode issues. People disconnect once in a while.
Others are new, I seem be freezing at least once per session, a long lockup that resolves 15 to 20 seconds later, often confusing my friends in multiplayer.

They have some funny bits, and I like some of the voice actors they've chosen. The actor for Bojack Horseman makes a good candid villain, and he's a better villain than BL3 had. They give him a strange narrative. He's evil, but if he knows none of these characters are real, then his actions have no true negative impact. He tries to buddy up to the character, appealing to them. Maybe that story will go somewhere good. I have no issues with the story beats so far, they haven't killed half the cast this time for dramatic effect.

It also smells like Egoraptor, I'm glad he's in this again (as the demi-lich).

TL;DR: I'm glad I bought it at a sale. It's a weaker game than BL3 with a better story (though abstract and silly). It doesn't fill your pockets with legendaries, but also somehow only gives me a duplicate cosmetic on a nat 20 on dice that don't respawn and don't exist across characters. Really?

It's like Borderlands 3 with a fantasy twist, and I have to admit, it's been a wild ride. You get to shoot goblins in the face with a flaming crossbow, throw gigantic meteors at weird mushrooms, and hang out with a horse made of diamonds. It's pure chaos, and I love it!

The writing and voice acting in Wonderlands are top-notch. The comedic cast is one of the best I've seen in a game, and it's been a laugh-out-loud experience from start to finish. The absurdity and violence in this fantasy-infused looter shooter RPG are just my cup of tea. I mean, who wouldn't enjoy killing Smurfs and trying to figure out how to remove ""plot armor"" from a character?

Combat is a blast, and the thousands of crazy weapons you can find make it even better. Sure, there are some reused elements from Borderlands 3, but the transition to high fantasy has added a fun twist to the gameplay. Plus, the addition of spells and magical abilities keeps things fresh.

On the downside, the main story falls a bit flat. It's predictable, and the fact that it takes place within a simulated tabletop campaign leaves it feeling somewhat frivolous. But honestly, the sheer fun of the gameplay and the memorable characters make up for it.

There are a few missteps, like the uninspired combat encounters and the samey feeling of character classes when playing in a full squad. However, the overworld exploration adds a charming touch and breaks up the action nicely.

In the end, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a fantastic spinoff that delivers on the humor and mayhem we love in Borderlands games. It may play it safe in some areas, but the crazy adventure and hilarious moments make it absolutely worth diving into. If you're a fan of looter shooters and over-the-top fantasy, this game is a must-play.

The classic Borderlands humor is there in bits and pieces; the Skelly-mens dialogue in fights is hilarious. But the overarching story falls flat. Plus, the Tiny Tina bit gets old FAST. In BL2, it was great to meet this quirky character who did funny voices, or called you Mamasita, etc. But an entire game of that - it got old quick. 
Dungeons are a slog. Most of the game is ""encounters."" Where you collect a shrine piece, or a side quest item. You hop into a closed arena with a pre-set amount of mobs to kill and at the end get your item. This, over and over and over again, gets tedious.
Adding stats to your character - Strength = Crit Damage Buff, Dexterity = Crit Chance Buff - that was a nice touch, and you can pick an Archetype at creation that innately buffed your class choice, i.e. +Wisdon if you wanted a caster, etc.
There's a heavy emphasis on melee attacks in this game. In fact, your melee weapon is now equippable with its own stats and damage like any other weapon. However, you still only have the default melee attack button as with any other BL game. No combos, no rolling or dodging, you just stand in front of an enemy and mash 'V' (for PC players) over and over. Tedious.
Everything else about the game is boilerplate for a BL game. Weapon types, damage types, art style, it's all the same. This feels more like an up-jumped DLC than a full game on its own. Like the main BL team handed over all of its art assets and game engine to another studio to make something BL-adjacent.
Lastly, for lack of a better term, the game as ""Woke"" as hell. Quests, NPCs, even audio-only lore narration - someone is gay, or trans, or asexual. That by itself isn't a bad thing, but the game just clobbers you over the head with it at every turn. It reminds me of a 12 year old, green-haired tween at Thanksgiving who's decided they have new pronouns, are Bi and everyone else there needs to know it *constantly.* It's obnoxious.

Something that sets this game apart from the rest is its wealth of heart. Other instalments have had some heart, sure, but it was always in short supply, secondary by far to the humour. This game balances the two more cleanly, with tales of redemption, true love and romantic ambition, to name just a few themes. Also, the aesthetics are gay AF.

On the other hand, the graphics are still a bit unstable. Sometimes textures don't load, sometimes buttons stay middle screen far too long. Sometimes your companions's status bars show dead when the companion is fine. The inventory system is bulky and the weapons naming system is somewhere between senseless and hard to decode. A tighter algorithm for single-person play might benefit a good deal, but, hey, at least there's plenty of loot to sell. Also, in-game cut scenes tend to slow the pacing somewhat.

There are plenty of weapons to go around and you can build any type of class you want with the huge variety that multi classing allows you. While the story may bore some people, there are so many side missions that create their own worlds and bosses. Each area is full of secrets, if people are having trouble finding good loot its probably because they are avoiding finding the secret dice that make your loot better, they are also not hard to find on your own.

I always loved the BL series and this game is very close in story telling pacing and wacky characters. There are hilarious side missions that like in every other BL game are stupid and there just to have a break from the intense rounds of gunfire.

the weapons are fine, a few are very fun to use but the variety isn't there. The meelee weapons though, are a real highlight for me. A bunch of spells are pretty fun too, namely the dragon lord skulls and the electric talons.

I WANT to say its good. It looks good, it feels pretty good, its artsy.. Its neat
But holy cow is it hard to enjoy these while being bogged down by everything else.

This game will start off by crashing, a lot. Is your machine good? This game doesnt care. You will get crashes up the ass, download things you shouldn't, and reinstall too much before you realize its not your computer. After you FINALLY get into the game, everything really does look nice.. Until you get to the UI. The inventory isn't the best, it really isnt. It works, but I'd rather look at just about anything else.

Did you come here from BL3? Are you expecting lots of cool guns and stuff? You wont find that here. This game has worse gun diversity than bl1, and thats saying a LOT. Outside of ""quest areas"" You will basically be stuck playing arena over and over, and over.. Its super repetitive, which sucks since this game, again, looks super nice. 

Melee weapons in borderlands sounds AWESOME. And they are kinda fun, until you pick anything but the 1-2 classes that really use that. Besides that its never really worth it. Besides, you'll be very familiar with the 3 or so swords you can find. 

The skill/stats. Its fun, its goofy..... Its restrictive.. You lock yourself into a single playstyle for the entire game, unlike BL3 where you can kind of switch between a number of playstyles. 

final thoughts? If the game is on sale, like when I got it. Yes, good deal.

Overall gameplay-wise overall enjoyable, with the whole looter-shooter core gameplay, together with the RPG style exploring and adventuring / questing.

Reasons to play - 

✅ The game runs great. I played at a consistent 4k 60 with barely any fps drops even in chaotic areas. Its feels very well optimised compared to BL3
✅The story is enjoyable and stays on its path. Some of the other BL steer from the main objective a little but TTW stays on the same story path.
✅ It has a much better dialogue than BL3. Admittedly cheesy at times but that's BL in general and if your a BL fan you know what to expect. 
✅It still oozes with the borderlands that we love in terms of art style, gameplay etc.
✅ Graphically beautiful with very dynamic and changing maps as you play through the story.
✅ New classes to play with, with an option to combine two classes into one build.
✅ New weapons to play with and a higher focus on melee weapons. Spells are also a great feature to your build. 

Reasons its not worth more than $29,

❌ The level cap is at level 40 which is really low compared to the other BL Series. You end game at roughly level 38 with around 20 side quests completed. 
❌ The Chaos Chamber is an end game feature unlock, But i personally feel there is no point to it as there is no real reason to play it unless you want the level 20 chaos chamber achievement and the level 40 achievement, if you didn't make that level by end game. 
❌ There is no True Vault Hunter mode or similar. You play once, finish once, and that's you which makes grinding for legendary weapons absolutely pointless in my opinion. With previous BL series farming was a big thing to kill the higher tier enemies but as above once your at story end game, Thats you. there is nothing else to enjoy unless you want to start at level 1 again with a new class. 
❌ Golden key chest / skeleton key as they call them in this game is useless. I've put around 500 keys through it and ended up with roughly 50 legendary weapons which had terrible stats. Previous BL series all weapons etc were all legendary items. This time they are mostly just rare or common.
❌ Very limited weapons compared to the other BL series. It seems to be the same weapons with different damages or elemental effects.
❌ limited amount of gear in general. 
❌ Enemy variation isn't great. Again very limited and the same ones appear with different elemental damages or buffs
❌ Drop rates are not the best through the story. I think i had 2 legendary items drop from 0 - level 38. All legendary were obtained at the end when there's no real need for them.
❌ DLC is overpriced and absolutely pointless for 20 minutes worth of gameplay. I didnt purchase it but I did watch videos of those who have. 

Overall, I enjoyed the game. I did enjoy the detailed dynamic maps, bright colours, the Dungeons and Dragons themed story, the new class system, spells and the return of butt stallion as dragons keep was my all time favourite DLC from BL2. I finished the game at roughly 29 hours in which makes $1 an hours worth of game play. Worth in in my opinion but i wouldn't pay its original asking price.

Now I enjoyed the gameplay, it has all the good bits from previous borderlands games and lots of neat extras that make the minute to minute gameplay great. I only played single-player as this game is old at this point and no one on my friends list either has it or has already played it. 

The story is fun and there's lots of genuinely funny moments, and if you like Tina this will only make you like her more. 
It's understandable if some of the more reference heavy jokes don't land though.
However the pacing is a bit off sometimes, like basically the game expects you to push the story only until you open up traversing the ocean as several things like weapon and gear slots are locked behind that. Additionally if you just focus the story the game is very short as you only need to do 8-9 quests to reach the final boss including the tutorial. Also the world map feature makes the world feel small too despite in theory having roughly the same amount of locations/maps as other Borderlands games the fact that 5 of them are 100% optional and don't feel connected in anyway means this ""Big Fantasy World"" feels tiny. However that might be a intentional aspect due to it's B&B(D&D) inspired world. 

Also, no actual DLC. All the DLC is extra optional dungeons which are just a series of arena fights and not full exploratory areas.

Bosses
 I felt 3's bosses had immunity phases for no reason although they are still present in this game they are lessened to a significant degree. Bosses have more unique move sets then past iterations and feels more individualized. 
Loot.
Legendarys feel alright to good, though i think borderlands 2 still had the most diverse legendays. 
Loots new anoints can be rolled making it more feasible to get god rolls without taking out the need to farm which i enjoy. 
Classes
Classes all are fun and can be powerful in their own right. 
Endgame
endgame is in the style of repeating dungeons/ rouge-lite making it feel fun and fresh. 
Their are different types of dungeons like boss only or daily challenge as well giving you a good bit of options to run.
however endgame is missing the classic raid boss which is a shame.
Story
Story is still borderlands humor but not nearly as forced and 2012 like as the 3rd. (no ""amazballs"" nonsense)
DLC
i do not have the dlc as its $30 dollars with terrible reviews and after watching some videos on it seems very content lacking. Though i like the game so much i will get it when its on sale again if its $5-$10.
Overworld
i think the overworld is boring and takes you out of the flow and experience. Also the fast travel system is the worst out of any in the series but is decently easy to use when you figure it out.

All in all i like it more then 3 by a significant degree even though it was shorter and would recommend to get it when its on sale unless your really lacking a game to play or need to scratch that looter shooter itch.

Which is disappointing because the premise is a unique one that has the potential to be done well. In Wonderland you play as an unnamed character joining Borderlands’ recurring character Tiny Tina as she leads you and some other characters on a DnD campaign she has written herself. The game starts out really good as they introduce you to the mechanics, gameplay elements and the unique twists they’ve introduced to the game, but then it falls apart quickly.

My biggest problem with this game is that it is incredibly repetitive. See most Borderlands games involve a lot of shooting the room full of bad guys and moving on to complete your next objective, no big deal. But this game frequently insists on stopping all progression until you stand in a room and fight off waves of enemies until you hit a certain quota, then sending you one room over to repeat the process. An objective that should take me 2 minutes to get too ends up taking 20 minutes because of how frequently they insist I stop and fight off waves of enemies. This is further amplified with the games overworld. Instead of having a world map you fast travel with, you’re instead given a recreation of the map that your character can walk around on and go to your next objective, a unique idea to make the world feel connected. But it’s littered with random encounters and areas that all teleport you to a small map where you fight off waves of enemies until a progress bar fills, then they boot you back to the overworld when you’re done. The game is constantly throwing you into waves of fights against the same enemies with very slight variations. While they do have DnD inspired enemies like trolls, goblins, and skeletons they all shoot guns like the regular enemies and have a melee and grenade attack, essentially making them the same enemies with different skins. This issue is most prominent after the final boss where you unlock challenge runs where you are sent to several encounters in a row that consist of being sent to a small map and fighting off waves of enemies. There’s no variety of challenge even in the fights that they’re constantly forcing you to be a part of. The most they do is give the enemies more health making these fights last even longer.

The story doesn’t fare much better. Borderlands has always been a series with several iconic characters that they’ve built up throughout the games, but Wonderlands wants to jump straight into having lots of wacky characters so they introduce a new one every 10 minutes hoping that at least one of them becomes a wakey mainstay. The problem is with so many characters at once we never really get time to know anything about them before we’ve given a new one. Some of them are only around for one quest so we’re quickly given an exposition dump to their backstory, motivations and their character arc. It makes their stories feel pointless because we race through them so quickly. Even Tina and her friends don’t add much to the story because all their dialog is either quips or narrating what another character just told us to do but with a cheeky comment. Here’s how a typical situation plays out:

Quest Giver: ‘I need you to open this locked door’
Tina: ‘Ok everyone time to open this locked door, you’ll probably want to find something key shaped to open this door that is locked’
Tina’s Friend: ‘What’s something key shaped we could use to open this door?’
Tina’s Friend 2: ‘Maybe a key?’
Everyone: *loses their minds over solving the puzzle*

Meanwhile we’re in our 4th fight since the quest started heading to the key that is one room over. 

It’s so frustrating and boring. I’ve been trying to finish this game for over a year now but just kept getting so bored I’d put it down for a while and then pick it back up, only to get bored and put it back down. The only character with any kind of depth is the final boss the Dragon Lord. They establish that he actually has the power to change the story that Tina has written and is trying to break free of her control. Yet another interesting concept of the DnD characters trying to rebel against the players of the game. But they do nothing with it. They keep building up that the Dragon Lord is going to break free and take over the story but they do nothing with it. It’s so frustrating when we reach the climax where we learn the truth about the Dragon Lord and his powers and then do absolutely nothing about it. Nope we jump right into a boss fight then get a generic ending that’s implied to be deep because of the emotional moment we were supposed to have earlier, but it isn’t earned. You can’t just have a character say a bunch of stuff that sounds emotional and then do nothing with it. I need a reason to care for these characters. If a character tells me a sad story about their childhood then leaves and never comes back I have no investment in them as a character because there’s no arc or resolution. It’s just pointless. And that’s the thing that annoys me most about this game. They’re trying so hard for you to have an emotional attachment to these characters but they have no arcs. They’ll just tell a sad story that happened to them in their life and expect that to be enough for you to be fully invested and like them. When in reality they’re just a bunch of nothing characters in a completely forgettable game.

I’ve never been so disappointed in a Borderlands game. I get that I’m not going to get an incredibly deep story or groundbreaking gameplay in these games, but this one especially is taking the piss. It’s like they were banking that Tiny Tina and the franchise were so big that people would like it on that alone and did nothing to try and write a good story or introduce any new ideas. It’s just a bad, boring game that is so proud of itself that it doesn’t realize how shallow and pointless it really is.

Game (campaign): 4/5

Steam should add a neutral rating after all these years.

(After 2-3 hours in:) Too many crashes and other games just work fine. My system has 32 GB of RAM and 12 GB of VRAM, graphics settings are medium, yet this game still has memory allocation crash issues more than a year after release? There, have your thumbs down for that.

(After 18 hours in:) Had some other game that also uses a ""newer"" UE4 (Unreal Engine 4) crash with similar issues. It has an option for ""slow CPUs"" that fixed the issues there. I turned texture streaming to ""low"" (makes levels look pretty bad initially) and also applied ""-maxmem"" command line option to limit RAM usage and that seems to have fixed the issues, mostly. I will not iterate over all this to find the most optimal solution, I'm not getting paid for this QA work.

Big plus: The game has shown only one small glitch in regard to aspect ratio, many more modern games have huge troubles with anything not 16:9 (what a regression over the years), and it is also able to deal more properly with 2 screens with different resolutions (some games have no option at all for that).

About the game: The Borderlands 3 roots are very obvious. It feels like someone tried to implement a pen'n'paper RPG campaign BL3 style with a big world board (homage to oldschool JRPGs with BL twist), some predefined (and often recycled) small encounter areas, and larger ""normal"" main campaign areas that equal typical BL maps.

Ignoring the mod though pretty much nothing from the previous games has been repeated here there's very little dedicated boss drops most of the minibosses don't even respawn the main method of farming new gear in this game is doing a very lackluster roguelite dungeon crawl and gather crystals as you fight through it and then feed the crystals to a bunny tied to a specific type of item it's fun for a bit but it does get old fast because there's not that much variety in the tilesets all end game content is tied to this roguelite as well because even raid bosses require you to play through the dungeon and do these weird rune challenges found randomly in the rooms the DLC does not really add stand out content either it's basically the headhunter dlcs from BL2 but with double the price tag and twice as shit not good at all and the bosses it adds don't have dedicated drops either you just kill the bosses for souls and use it on a roulette wheel in the main hub of the dlcs Max level in this game is only 40 and there isn't playable characters anymore it's a blank slate that you customize like something you'd find in a Bethesda RPG each class only has 1 skill tree and at level 15 you can add one of the other classes as a secondary but with the level 40 cap there's not enough skills to go around most of the time you'll never have enough to capstone either skill tree Also despite each class having a unique playstyle they don't feel unique really some builds can be made with completely different class choices each time and still just be just as effective they all feel middle of the row in terms of effectiveness which allows you to use many combinations of classes and still end up the same in terms of performance in my personal opinion this is a downside because it feels like if you've played one you've played them all",1689235025,1689235025,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The weapons are typical Borderlands style. Some look just like the ones in Borderlands 3. This time, you also have variations on crossbows.

I found plenty of Epic weapons and equipment but Legendary loot was in scarce supply. maybe I've been unlucky!

Like all Borderlands games, you have  the opportunity to play through again at a higher level with better loot when you complete the story (arguably more fun than the first play-through).

It's not even because this is a B&B world because I still liked him in the BL2 DLC, he's just insufferable now, either because of his new voice, how he's written this game, or both. #NotMyClaptrap, give me back my depressed unlucky boi), I actually enjoyed this. As someone who refuses to get BL3 because of the story despite wanting to because of everything else (It's tempting, but the story is just awful, so I will stay strong), it's my first experience to the newer generation of Borderlands games, and this allowed me to actually enjoy it. It looks good, I don't mind it being a bit short, and I enjoyed the story and how it centered around Tina just being a kid trying to DM a TTRPG, and a character that resents her and trying to fight back, and it gives a bit more backstory of how she became a DM to begin with. Do I recommend it? Eh, just get it on sale. I got the CGE when it was 2/3rds off, and the DLC are basically just arenas that increase in difficulty with each completion, not bad if you want to test out stuff without going through the Chaos Chambers, but they offer basically no extra story. However if you do want to get the DLC, just get the CGE on sale like I did instead of buying the season pass or something, it's cheaper that way.

+ Amazing setting
+ Great voice acting
+ Immersive sound 
+ High fidelity environments
+ Fluid gameplay

- Few fast travel points
- Dungeons can get repetitive
- Loot is a hit or miss
- Only a handful of spells
- No postFX options in menu. Need a mod to disable Chromatic Aberration, DOF and Vignette

Steam Curator: https://rb.gy/w9b9x

Overall, this game is what I personally believe the borderlands series needed to feel fresh. The pre sequel was a boring disaster, and Borderlands 3 felt like the same game, just more fleshed out. This gives us a setting that I have not seen in an FPS like this before. 

When the ""players"" interject as your mission goes on and add actually funny commentary, it gives a creative freedom to the game that I do not see often. The way the game is set up gives it the unique opportunity to get crazy, imaginative, and unique, without needing to make a lot of sense. Suspension of disbelief is very easily achieved because of this.

My favourite moments in the game is when the dungeon master, Tina, comes up with some elaborate scheme to trick you, or to change a circumstance to suit the progression in a convenient way. There are also moments where the setting she comes up with is dodgy at best, but in reality she was not trying to trick anyone. Things backfire, and it makes for a surprisingly decent character development for the dungeon master, as well as the other players in the game. 

The story so far is fairly decent, with a funny villain that I cannot wait to get my hands on. There are no vehicles for exploration as you just traverse the main world hub as if you were a pawn on a tabletop game. This does however mean that the exploring in the actual mission maps might come at a deficit since you have to walk everywhere, and fast travel points are far fewer than I would prefer.

It is notable however that the main areas are A TAD smaller than in B3, so the lack of a vehicle is not as impactful. The class system is also present and you can dual class after a certain point. Do not worry too much about which class you choose as your second class as changing it is possible.

I have been putting a lot of hours in B3 on my Steam Deck primarily, and I was starting to feel the fatigue of just going through the game mindlessly. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is such a favourable setting, to me, that it takes away the monotony of just progressing through a game by making it a lot more interesting. I would highly recommend this game, especially on a deep discount. Currently under 20$ on Steam and that is a steal.

Stay away from the DLC of this game however. Especially the season pass. Borderlands games have already been laughable at making good DLC and this is no exception. 

For more, consider subscribing and leaving a like, it goes a long way for me.

When the first borderlands came out it introduced many new mechanics combining shooter looter rpg elements. Now with this latest installment capitalising on its most interesting and likeable character, Tiny Tina, it tries to bring in more variety whilst sticking to its roots. It is a fun game I can recommend to any borderlands fan. 
New changes ive noted and welcomed - a dual class system for more experimenting with builds. 
More character customisation. 
The unpredictable usage of old fav characters from prev series. 

Things that were missing:
I think a backdrop story relating to the main borderlands would have been helpful. I think a story where Tiny Tina discovers old DnD rulebooks and modifies it to her own rules because she is a lazy genius. She then kidnaps unwilling players to play her game. Thats where you the new player comes in, waking up strapped to a chair, answering basic questions as part of character customisation, as part of being interrogated by Tina to see if you are 'willing' to play her game and while she designs your character card/backstory. Rather than a tabletop and using imagination, she uses VR and tabletop. The game therefore switches back and forth between three 'worlds', VR (main game), tabletop (overworld), reality (cutscenes in the real world with dialog choices - these cutscenes can be short & initiated by the removal of the VR goggles to warn players, and then speaking to Tina and the other unwilling players in the reality. It can also sometimes be a small ingame window as per the older borderlands game). I think it would be cool where cutscenes showing what remains of previous players who refuse to voiceact for example or of Tina sometimes showing a mature side would really elevate the main story. In the end, the ultimate story of Tina really wanting to force finish this game as escapism for finding her parents and living happily ever after, but in the end settling for her friends instead and learning to form real relationships would be a more meaningful story but can also be as lighthearted/satirical as needed for a borderlands game. Sidequests will elude to various clues to tie in with the real world. It could have been a real gem of a story, with DLCs relating to backstories of the other characters in the real world. Also... claptrap didnt need to be the same old claptrap. A missed opportunity would have been to used him as the tutorial guide but in a different form, such as the hero he envisions himself as, as a throwback to earlier games. In fact, he could be the programmer for Tina's VR game, therefore funny glitches/malfunctions can happen in game. 
With a RPG focus, I think the inventory screen could be much better... its still the same sidebar even when within the inventory tab, there is so much wasted real estate on screen. 
Inability to switch spells on the fly like guns. If you are in a spell build, and your one equipped spell is ineffective against an enemy then its abit annoying. at least allowing players to equip 2 spells or quickswap would have been useful and easily implemented. Same for melee. Maybe could have made guns that double as melee weapons too.
Certain guns have lost all advantage. I found myself just selling any snipers and most bazookas i had. They were pretty useless in dps and since crits seldom one hit an enemy... not even 2 hit... probably 10+ headshots to down one. 
Borderlands enemies are typically interesting & unique but this one felt uninteresting due to fantasy elements being very explored by other games. They could have gone really wild with the characters here since its a meld between postapocalypse, cyberpunk, steampunk and medieval with a satirical setting. Instead we see goblins, skeletons, imps and mushroom people... really? Eg. i really liked their play on magic missle and the bardbarian... Im not sure why they couldnt go a little more unique on their enemy designs... Eg. Tina loves bunnies, why not use that instead. Rather than help a town besieged by skeletons yawn... Maybe a town of unwilling playactors dressed in bunny costumes besieged by redneck zombie werewolves or something. 

Bad stuff
I personally hate games that scatter hidden items that are crucial. Its ok if its just for fun to discover but items like the lucky dice which increases your loot luck makes it somewhat crucial to find. This game mechanic is there as a filler. It should be made 100pc optional. The game relies on gear discovery more than levelling up to progress as  a powerful character... so i think this is a huge oversight. As someone who works, I can only spend so much time playing a game. Thus to maximise efficiency, I found myself either scouring the edges of the map from the getgo, not being able to appreciate the handcrafted maps as it should, but instead looking out for the nooks and crannies. When NPCs start talking, Id wander off to stupid places like trying to climb roofs or jump ledges, where else in the past, Id pay more attention to the ingame scenes. The other option would be to check on the internet for the hidden locations and it becomes much more of a chore rather than a discovery. To all game designers please do not do this esp for AAA titles. Id say borderlands devolved abit when it became more reliant on such mechanics as a filler. 
There were other RPG elements they could have added instead such as dialogue choices, minigames, recruitable NPCs, skill checks, more fledging out of the melee combat. 
Instances in a grassfield akin to pokemon was annoying. I found myself running away whenever i could as they were so so meaningless.

Overall, I think this installment has played it safe here and because of that it was uninteresting. However, it does deliver a solid borderlands experience. To a newcomer, I wouldnt recommend this game though as it would just seem like a mixmash of mechanics which fails to deliver on what seems like crucial aspects of combat like melee/spellcasting (which to the usual borderlands fan is totally acceptable)",1688570055,1688570055,True,1,0,0.50205761194229126,0,True,False,False

This game is the big dopamine.

++ Really fun and varied guns. I feel like I started finding awesome guns earlier into this game than I did when my friends and I tried Borderlands 2.
++ Fun and completely self-aware parody of TTRPGs
++ Surprisingly great character creator
++ Great, seamless performance
++ Very smooth gameplay, fast and devoid of jank and clunk
+ Ultrawide support
+ Funny dialogue, and Ashly Burch clearly having a blast voicing the GM
+ Pretty graphics
+ We love the slide in modern shooters

Glad this came down to a price I felt good enough about, I'm having a great time so far.

You can't change your secondary class before you beat the game, you can't even change your main class even if your character is a pure blank slate. 

Thanksfully, Wonderlands Redux solve most of the issue, but modders shouldn't have to fix the game. 

It's still a good improvement around the base formula. Inclusion of Melee and revamp of life steal notably are great. 

Oh also, some class just don't work as well as others. Graveborn for example has synergies all over the place and can be a good main or sub while Clawbringer is kind of a one trick poney that isn't even that good at what it does.

Edit : 
Tried it again because the Wonderlands Redux overhaul mod seems awesome, and my opinion on the game just dropped lower. The mod is awesome, but the base game has some deep issues. UI notably is really bad.

I know there will be a mod that tries to delete this comment, then promptly ban me from the forums because I am leaving a negative review, I also know there will be the orbiting rabid fans that will false flag my steam account because of this negative review. So, before I get into the game stuff, I thought It is high time someone mention this, and well it might as well be me.

I never thought I would see the borderlands fandom turn so foul that if you dislike an entry into the series, that no matter how peaceful and respectful you write a review out, you are then labelled a hater and a troll and must be censored. If you say you have been with borderlands since day one of the original game (i.e.: Borderlands Veteran) then you are labelled a bigoted exclusionary elitist (yes, this was actually said to me more than once) and censored then false flagged.  I did a well thought out respectful negative review for borderlands three, and next I know I had a mod try to VAC ban me on steam. Why? Because I was not gushing about the game. I always allow comments on my reviews, so I would love to know how a fandom community could go from laughing and enjoying tongue in cheek humor to give this game a glowing review otherwise you need to remove from the gaming platform.

Now as for Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. I will not lie; I picked up the Chaotic Great Edition as (at time of my review) the steam summer sale is going on, and if I could get it for $33 then why not? I mean sure, I had a very low interest in the game but I do love me Butt Stallion, so why not?

I lasted an hour before I said I had enough and put in for a refund, and here is why:

[b] Graphics [/b]
I have a rather beefy gaming computer. I mean I can play Monster Hunter Rise (released 2021) on Ultra getting 120 FPS. I can play Atomic Heart that was released four months ago (February 2023) on Ultra and get 120fps. However, when it comes to Tiny Tina's Wonderlands (released 2022) on low settings and get a weak 20 FPS., no thanks as I am not going to play a game the way I did seven years ago when I first started gaming.

[b] Tutorial [/b]
Remember when these used to words on a screen, or even an option to the game? Not in this game. You are actually taken by the hand and coddled through it. We are in 2023, who does not know how to walk or move in a game? At this point even those new to the franchise with this game knows the basics of Borderlands, so I am not sure who the baby treatment is for.

[b] Game play [/b]
When did the Bad Ess's (Steam will not let me say the real name) become weak wet paper bags? At level one I was taking down Bad Ess's like they were nothing, in fact I was taking them down in less than 30 seconds while using the randomized loot dropped from previous enemies (not the DLC stuff from the edition) Where did the challenge go? Same with the first level boss, less the two minutes he was done.

[b] Voice Acting [/b]
[i] IAshly Burch (Tiny Tina) [/i] is back, and it is always a joy to hear how she plays the role. 

[i] IWanda Sykes (Fretta) [/i] I always adored both her acting and voice acting, as I find she is a great comedy and fits wonderfully in any role she is give.

[i] Will Arnett (Dragon Lord aka Bo Jack) [/i] A fantastic replacement for [i] IDameon Clarke (Handsome Jack) [/i]. If I was not laughing so hard at what Will Arnett popped off with, I would wonder how many lines he ad libbed.

[i] IAndy Samberg  (Captain Valentine)  [/i] I wanted to reach through the screen and smack the hell out of this character.

Now, after all that, I will not recommend you buy this game. However, I am also not going to recommend someone buy this game. It is your money, it is your interest, and it is your time into the game that is going to be vested. This has been my experience and my opinion on the game nothing more or less.",1688136398,1688136398,False,7,2,0.383391082286834717,4,True,False,False

Rating: ⭐⭐

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, the spin-off title in the Borderlands universe, sadly falls short of expectations and fails to deliver the same level of excitement and enjoyment as its predecessors. Despite its charming premise and attempts to inject humor and fantasy elements into the gameplay, the overall execution leaves much to be desired.

One of the biggest letdowns in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is the lackluster storytelling. While the Borderlands series is known for its witty writing and engaging narratives, this spin-off struggles to find a cohesive and compelling story. The humor feels forced and often falls flat, and the plot fails to create a sense of investment or intrigue. The attempts to blend fantasy elements with the established Borderlands universe feel disjointed and disconnected, resulting in an underwhelming and confusing narrative experience.

Furthermore, the gameplay in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands fails to impress. The combat lacks depth and strategy, often devolving into repetitive button-mashing with little variation or challenge. The character progression system feels shallow, with limited options for customization and advancement. The overall gameplay loop becomes monotonous quickly, with little incentive to continue playing beyond the initial novelty.

The visual presentation of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a mixed bag. While the game retains the colorful and cel-shaded art style that is synonymous with the Borderlands series, it feels uninspired and lacks the visual flair that made its predecessors stand out. The environments, while varied, lack the level of detail and creativity that would have enhanced the fantasy-themed setting. Additionally, the technical performance can be inconsistent, with occasional frame rate drops and graphical glitches.

Another notable drawback is the lack of substantial multiplayer features. While the Borderlands franchise has thrived on its cooperative gameplay experience, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands fails to deliver a satisfying multiplayer component. The cooperative play feels tacked on and lacks the depth and seamless integration found in previous titles, resulting in a less enjoyable and cohesive multiplayer experience.

In conclusion, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a disappointing spin-off that fails to capture the magic of the Borderlands series. From its lackluster storytelling and unimpressive gameplay to its underwhelming visual presentation and subpar multiplayer features, the game falls short in nearly every aspect. While it may appeal to die-hard fans of the franchise or those seeking a lighthearted and simplistic gaming experience, it ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying and engaging adventure.",1688062133,1688062133,False,15,1,0.541656255722045898,0,True,False,False

Me and the friends I played with didn't actually end up finishing the game, but we got to the final boss. I wanted to add my updated notes to the end of my last review but It somehow way surpassed the text limit (lol) so I'm gonna just try and reformat my thoughts Into a condensed checklist.

I only played BL2 before this game and did not play the DLC this Is based on. I went In with 2 friends and came out with 0 (sorry for making you guys play this shit). 

[b]TL:DR -[/b] Game has Incredible themeing and has gorgeous art design and world, but Is very boring, repetitive and tedious. Extremely overpriced and feels lazy and lackluster compared to other games In the franchise. Don't bother with this one.

[b][u]Pros[/u][/b]
[list]
   [*] Character customisation.
   [*] Gorgeous art direction. The world and setting Is colourful, creative and fantastic.
   [*] Some epic cutscene moments and cool character Introductions.
   [*] Fantasy theming.
   [*] Some cool magical spells, abilities and classes.
   [*] More diversity and inclusivity.
[/list]

[b][u]Cons[/u][/b]
[list]
   [*] Game Is overpriced EVEN on sale. $30 Is more than me and my friends would spend on most games, and that was this game on HALF price.
   [*] Character customisation Is lackluster. You can pick a voice but they all say the same things and lack the unique and fun personalities of characters from other Borderlands games.
   [*] Player voices are all British (I think) but voiced by Americans and It's.. Noticeable..
   [*] Levels feel extremely closed off / boxed In and repetitive. A lot of really small instances, but some bigger levels here and there.
   [*] Levels are connected via invisible wall instead of the more immersive gates and such as other Borderlands and feels awkward at times.
   [*] Random encounters and side quests feel half arsed and are extremely repetitive and BORING.
   [*] Story missions feel randomly strung together and not cohesive (like this checklist).
   [*] Half of the game feels like 0 effort went Into It. Some incredible scenes happen In the main story just for you to walk into an invisible wall and have your immersion ruined, before transitioning to a lame DnD board overworld.
   [*] DnD overworld Is kind of funny at first, but It takes you out of whats going on and feels like a drag to navigate later on.
   [*] Most weapons feel very clunky and weak, and most of them don't even feel like they fit the weapon they are meant to be, like shotguns where you aim down the sight and zoom In super far?
   [*] Melee weapons do NO damage and you feel punished for getting up close to do a melee attack when the guns do 10x the damage.
   [*] Store Is confusing. Me and my other 2 friends sold all our items by mistake the first time we used It due to the weird formatting.
   [*] Combat doesn't feel as satisfying, you don't really notice as many colourful numbers popping up as you did In other games whilst dealing damage.
   [*] Extremely repetitive enemies. There Is a small amount of diversity here and there, but I hope you enjoy fighting skeletons for 90% of the game.
   [*] Very hard to tell when someone dies In this game. Barely any sound effect or visual cue compared to previous games.
   [*] DLC Is shoved In your face In some areas and by the looks of their reviews, I guess you don't wanna buy that-
   [*] Visual bugs like showing players as being dead when they are not, or having pop ups stuck on the screen.
   [*] Being forced to listen to characters talk forever as the map refuses to let you progress until they STFU. Happens way too often and feels like It just wants to drag more playtime out of you.
   [*] Map Is too clunky to control or use.
   [*] Main story level progression Is too extreme. From one story mission to the next, It will jump up 5 to almost 10 levels.
   [*] You need to do side missions to progress some of the story but they are not MARKED as your main story so you can get lost or confused.
   [*] Side quests that have you find items just spawn them In a fat chest at the end of 50 tiny crappy instances Instead of being found naturally In the world.
   [*] Spells target enemies you're not even aiming at.
   [*] Fights that have many allies and foes don't show healthbars so you can't tell who's on your team or not.
   [*] Characters teleporting to the next location or vanishing Instead of walking there.
   [*] Story feels disjointed or Idk how half of It Is even meant to be connected?
   [*] Healthbar hitboxes are bigger than some enemies so will show you a healthbar for an enemy you're not focusing on.
   [*] Giant bricks having the physics of styrofoam.
   [*] [spoiler]Finding an object to help you cross an ""invisible bridge"" that you just FALL THROUGH without the object? The definition of Invisible changed apparently.[/spoiler]
   [*] Hordes of enemies spamming the EXACT SAME SOUNDS..
   [*] Too many quests requiring you to just ""kill every enemy"". These missions could repeat up to 7+ TIMES per level.
   [*] For said quest one of our enemies got stuck underwater some how and we COULDN'T kill them.
   [*] Being attacked whilst you're already DEAD.
   [*] Bug where my character was unkillable.
   [*] Story cutscene knocked my friend off a ledge and triggered the checkpoint at the start of the map. He was stuck there until we got a new one.
   [*] Too many tanky shield regen bosses that are just BORING and unfun to play against.
   [*] Bugged quest marker on minimap.
   [*] Friend teleported somewhere I don't think he was meant to be (looked like a dev edit space).
   [*] Can't change your secondary class until finishing the game (despite the tool tip suggesting otherwise).
   [*] Getting a kill can revive you but friends and status effects can easily steal these kills.
   [*] Some bosses charge and move way faster than you and you have no dodge or mobility moves to counter this.
   [*] Basic enemies being tedious and near unkillable sometimes.
   [*] Friend grinding to reccomended level of 30 only for his enemies to also level up to about 37 anyway.
   [*] Friend dying during a LOADING screen despite entering It full HP and getting fined for It.
   [*] Changing the difficulty doesn't make a difference.
   [*] Final boss has no music and Is a clusterfuck of unfair anti-fun bullshit.
   [*] Story just kind of sucks and gets extremely annoying, despite having some cool moments here and there.

Enjoy fighting skeletons and sometimes a crab or two in every single level throughout the entire game, all repeating the same screaming audio line overlayed a hundred times, more and more enemies spawning out of nowhere constantly, enemies all having way more health than they should for no reason, a boring and disjointed world of various places separated by an overworld because it feels like the devs were too lazy to make a full map, the most uninteresting quests of any game i've ever played, and cringeworthy fake accents.
Me and two friends played borderlands 2 and absolutely loved it, so we chose this as the next game to play together. We all hated this one. One of them got so bored he gave up with the game, but me and the other friend agreed to try finish it if i did a bit of grinding to make it less agonising. So i did a bit of grinding which i didn't mind because like i said the loot is pretty interesting, but then after i spent 5 hours getting to level 29 so I was more prepared for this level 30 final mission, all the enemies were suddenly level 38. They literally now outlevel my friend who played normally without grinding by 16 levels. I'm basically at the recommended level, with enchanted legendary gear and elemental advantages, yet some of the enemies including the boss actually regen their shield faster than i can damage them. Also worth noting we were playing on easy mode, which didn't feel like it changed anything.
We quickly changed our minds about finishing the game. The fact that this game has level scaling but only uses it to make the game less enjoyable speaks volumes about what to expect from this game.

That's not really a bad thing since BL3 was a blast to play. This is just more of the same with some added stuff so it doesn't feel exactly like a BL3 extended DLC. 
It does add a lot of interesting stuff to the overall game-play. Guns feel powerful and the classes and being able to multi class is just a really fun addition to the game. 
Game-play is Solid. If you just want more Borderlands loot and shoot action, pick this game up (preferably on sale.) 

What really let me down was the humor, story, character writing, and overall vibe of the story. It's a bit weird that your Bunker and Badasses mates don't have a character of their own and they just tell the player what to do with some VERY lame banter. It was really hard to connect with them since they were just disembodied voices with no way to interact with them. I can't believe they were able to make Andy Samberg lame and boring. 

The side quests don't really have any humor or wittyness to them. I especially hated the Witcher quest where they just made Garret to be an asshat and that's the joke. That whole story-line just felt like someone who hated the witcher wanted to spite witcher fans. 

The main storyline was also very boring. It had no payoff, no suspense, nothing. It's just Tina being the worst kind of DM and never really getting punished for it. She never learned to let her players do the storytelling and rolling with the punches. No one really grows as characters in the story as well. The main bad guy has no payoff to him as well. 

There are some pretty alright jokes and jabs to TTRPG and D&D tropes, but it was pretty few and far between. 
I was also disappointed that there wasn't a lot of returning characters in this game. I was really waiting for Mordecai but he never shows up, or anybody else other than Brick and Mr. Torgue.

The story line was worth the play through though. It is a grinding game. The endgame content is somewhat lackluster since it's just chaos dungeons which are essentially just pushing the game difficulty as high as you can. I wish there was a little more diversity in the builds you could make but every time someone releases a video of a strong build it gets nerfed or you have to grind hours to get the gear maxed rolls. Thats the other downside. The RNG of gear is SO BAD. It's hard enough to find the damn item you want but it's another thing to get the rolls you want. The effects on the gear are not static which makes it even worse! Once you do find the item with the rolls you want though you notice the difference. Getting the right gear and the right stats makes a HUGE difference in our damage. Not sure I will play until chaos 100 it's a bit to much of a grind seeing all the same enemies but just more hp/damage from them. Needless to say I got 86 hours out of the game so it was worth the money. Story 8/10 because ""I love explosions"" but it did feel a little short. End game 5/10 theres only 1 way to push ""chaos"" levels. Loot 4/10 RNG is so bad affecting the stats and the item effects is just bad design when it could already take 100 hours just to get perfect stat rolls on the right effects but now you have to factor in even just getting the right effects on the item it might take me years, not fun. Overall though 7.5/10 I love that I can make a build around using spells or guns, or melee, or even my companion although balancing is clearly hard.

This game is not made for you to easily shoot people and sift through their loot. This game is made for you to be forced into watching and listening to unskippable custscenes/dialogue/animations. This was the major problem with Borderlands 3 and it has persisted here. Seriously, this sucks. I genuinely hate to see one of my favorite series do bad for NO OTHER REASON than the developers put as many unskippable narrative moments into their shooter as possible. This is a looter shooter, not Skyrim. But, EVEN IN SKYRIM YOU CAN SKIP ALMOST ALL OF THE DIALOGUE AND CUT-SCENES IF YOU WANT TO, SERIOUSLY GEARBOX TAKE A HINT! WHO THINKS ITS OKAY TO NEVER SKIP ANY DIALOGUE OR CUT-SCENES OR CHARACTER ANIMATIONS IN YOUR STUDIO??? 

Did you guys like actually sit through any of your dialogue more than once? Did you think it was worth listening to more than three times? Did you listen to it while pretending you would rather shoot stuff than listen to someone flap their gums? I won't be buying the next title you guys release as a shooter, even after playing all of the borderlands games throughout my life. I get the feeling you guys have forgotten about your customers that just want to shoot stuff, and I mean JUST WANT TO SHOOT STUFF, not EVER be forced into listening to things that I am physically required to stand directly next to. Even Borderlands 1 and 2 had the option to listen to people through some kind of long distance stuff if you walked away from them, you guys stopped doing that on purpose and it was one of the worst design decisions I have ever seen a developer make. 

This was so bad in Borderlands 3 that during my contract in The Navy I didn't have time between duty shifts to finish some of the unskippable narrative moments in that game with how long they were. That kind of development process is alive and well here. With respect to all of the time everyone has wasted on moments they could have skipped, respectfully, screw you guys and your failing studio that can't ship games with a 'skip' button.",1687137019,1687137050,False,2,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

With that said it isn’t all bad the games looter shooter design and gunplay mechanics make it undeniably fun to mow down waves of enemies but is never truly enough for Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands to identify as anything more than a carbon copy of all the other entries in the Borderland series.

Right from the Opening Credits Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands oozes with the colourful charm and on the nose humour that its predecessors were beloved for, however I couldn't help but feel as though the writers had limited their sense of creativity by binding themselves to the theme of Dungeons and Dragons, this is felt exponentially through it’s main campaign that at times felt stale, uninspired, and as if the writers never truly knew where to go with the games overall story and theme. What started as a very tongue in cheek take on the self proclaimed “Worlds Greatest Roleplaying Game”, pretty quickly became a handful of jokes about the most common tropes and clichés that have been recited to death in other forms of media. On many occasions I found myself pulled from my enjoyment by one of these various clumsily delivered quips that left me wanting for something more that didn’t feel like a second hand joke that had been pulled from the mouth of someone much more charismatic. The main campaign felt rushed and as though the inclusion of side quests was only to extend the average time it takes to reach the story's climax. At the time of review I have spent just under 20 hours in Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands with roughly over half of that spent deviating from the main campaigns path in order to reach the level recommendations for each quest, which resulted in slogging through many forgettable quests that just never truly captured that Borderlands charm. The story is told through the form of an in-universe version of D&D known as Bunkers & Badasses and is rather excellently narrated by the prolific voice over talent in Ashley Burch who returns to reprise her role as Tiny Tina, throughout the main story Tina as the “Bunker Master” guides her players through a wild and haphazardly thrown together Bunkers & Badasses campaign which sees the Player referred to as “Newbie” and the other players at the Table, Frett & Valentine, take on the evil forces of The Dragon Lord. Whilst the voiceover work that is put on display is top notch and the cast boasts names such as Ashley Burch, Andy Samburg and Wanda Sykes their terrific performances are never quite enough to save the campaign from itself and fail to make up for the very apparent rushed and lazy writing. I found myself giving a resounding sigh of relief at the sight of the games end credits and was left with no real desire to continue on with what remained of Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands clearly lazily thrown together side content.

For the most part Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands minute to minute gameplay loop is undeniably fun, however it seems to fall apart during the implementation of its new features that mostly feel ill-thought-out and at times tacked on to artificially increase the amount of time Gearbox could keep their players in game. The decision to completely remove vehicular travel and combat in favour for the new Overworld that seemed out of place and better implemented by games akin to Nino Kuni and Final Fantasies of old was a flawed design choice that not only had me feeling detached from the game world but has ensured that Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands has had more loading screens than most modern AAA titles. Unfortunately the cures of the new Overworld feature doesn’t end there, clearly added to the game in order to implement the new “Random Encounters'' that are a blatant design choice to reduce the amount of quality content needed to fill the game world. These random encounters see the player put into a small handful of encounter maps fighting a smaller diversity in enemy types making this new feature a very unwelcome one. My time in Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands was spent on their “balanced” or normal difficulty which was anything but balanced, leaving many of their bosses and minions feeling super easy to mow down and as though I was never in any real threat. My recommendation to anyone choosing to pick up Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands over any of the other entries into the Borderlands series is to play this game on its hardest difficulty in order to have the most enjoyable experience. Despite my harsh criticism the feature that I’d like to commend Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands for is their new class system that sees the player choosing from one of six classes that each are a take on typical character tropes from Dungeons & Dragons, this feature removes the character selection from previous Borderlands games and offers the player more choice in the character they want to play, this feature reaches greater depths once the player unlocks the capability to “Multiclass” giving them the chance to pick up a second one of the six classes. I spent my time playing a combination of the Clawbringer and Spellshot that gave me access to the wyvern companion and later multiclassing into the Spellshot heavily boosted the usefulness of my spells which take the place of grenades from the games of old. This combination of classes really allowed me to feel increasingly stronger the further along each skill tree I found myself going down. Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands gunplay is one of its best features, this however is overshadowed by the fact that it is still the basic combat and gameplay loop that other Borderlands games that in the past were renowned for  and resulted in it once again leaning on that Borderlands crutch in an attempt to fight for relevance.

To summarise, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands never truly manages to find its way out of the shadow of its predecessors and ultimately suffers from its lack of identity, whilst a fun but short experience it struggles under the weight of expectation that comes with the territory of being a spin off of a widely beloved series. After the curtain fell on its lacklustre campaign I couldn’t help but feel as though Gearbox Software never truly gave Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands the love and attention it needed to truly flourish into the game it tried to be. I cannot in good faith recommend this game at its full asking price but do believe it’s a valuable pick up on a hefty discount and believe that despite its glaring flaws there is still a fun experience underneath to be had. During my time with Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands I couldn’t help but feel as though this should have and would have been a great DLC inclusion to a main line Borderlands game instead of the half baked solo release that we received. My harsh criticisms come from a place of wanting Gearbox to recapture the love and attention older Borderlands games had in spades and not succumb in putting out soulless releases that rely heavily on the legacy of older games that other studios have become guilty of mass producing. Ultimately I had fun with Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands but couldn’t shake the unbearable feeling that it could have been so much more.",1686913579,1687134509,False,16,2,0.603822827339172363,0,True,False,False

Like a lot of people I started on BL2 where the tirade over the radio about butt stallion was so hilarious we'd keep referencing it.  We would laugh about all the funny things that torgue said and hunt for the funny possessed gun that yells at you. On the many MANY replays. 

There's not really anything quotable in this game.  Which is surprising since Tina is such a great character normally. The others sorta make appearances and that's fun but that's about it. 

Your skills are blurred between the different characters so even though one might start with better skills for a sniper nothing is really a big difference. 

The game play it repetitive.  None of the bosses are very challenging.  You just spam away and they die. 

Once you get through the story which doesn't take long you're leveled out.  You get orange things all the time. Gold keys are kinda pointless at this level because the chest doesn't get you anything better than you get for normal dungeon grinds.  You can get a currency to add an enchantment to your weapon but you cap out anytime you run the dungeons so it's not hard to get tons more.  And the enchantments don't really add much. 

For the price it was just really disappointing. And buggy.  You have companions that show as dead on your hud but are fine.  Teammates show as dead or no health when they're actually fine.  You loose your mini map icons randomly including that of your teammate. Just riddled with bugs.

This entry into the series is by far the least polished, with multiple bugs found throughout a relatively short (for a borderlands game) campaign. There was surely more to the story at some point, but it must have been cut, because I beat the campaign in about 8 hours (don't let my playtime fool you, i left my pc on idle over three play sessions). 

When you think of completing all the quests (both main and side) in a Borderlands game, you envision an endeavor that may take weeks, if not a month or two, as each location is overflowing with side quests. In Tiny Tina's wonderland, each map has <6 side quests, meaning that my 2nd playthrough (100% quests on Intense mode) only took me about a day. A Borderlands pro can probably knock it out in an afternoon.

The game had the potential to be a lot more than what it ended up being, but with the pandemic interrupting the development process and everyone having to work from home... well, let's just say it shows. Still, a pretty fun experience, wouldn't want to pay full price though. 

Unfortunately the devs released extremely buggy and lackluster DLCs and then abandoned this game, so don't hold out any hope for future updates. There is little to do post-game, as they replaced TVHM/UVHM with an endless ""chaos"" dungeon which borrows heavily from the roguelike genre. It's honestly not worth the effort though, as by this point you are earning incremental (like, 1%) buffs to your stats (as the level cap is a ridiculously low lvl40), and there isn't anything to DO with the guns you get from the chaos runs except do more chaos runs. It's fun for a few, but quickly feels shallow and repetitive.  

Likely the team is working on the next installment in the Borderlands franchise, and honestly I didn't mind all the flashy spells and lack of gore, I actually prefer the spells to grenades as they are more powerful and easier to control, but the writing suffered from the ESRB restrictions. I hope they abandon the T for Tina rating and go back to their roots, a full-length M rated Tiny Tina's 2 would be at the top of my wishlist.

The gameplay is clearly oriented around multiple players and as a solo all of the combat arenas last just a bit too long. The game gives you no time to experiment with the classes but I realized that without a class that provides a companion your DPS is significantly throttled. Overall the game just feel very slow. You have to stop to open chest, often taking quite a few precious seconds in the middle of combat. And the random loot is never worth killing enemies for compared to buying items from the shops. The narrative is really weak, often introducing bosses in the same battle you fight them which removes any narrative payoff you could derive from building. The games movement, dialogue, and art are all superb. Though, in another annoying instance of slowing the game down, you cannot skip through diegetic cutscenes. This leaves you to often jump around a room simply waiting for the NPCs to get through their long winded dialogue. 

In summary, the game is just a bit too slow and it fairly straight-forward take on the looter shooter genre doesn't hardly justify the asking price of 60USD. I would recommend it for 15USD.",1686458240,1686458240,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TTW takes a different approach to the theme of the Borderlands franchise, being set in a world of fantasy and magic controlled by the bunkermaster; Tiny Tina. This looter-shooter can be very satisfying but also feel a little off in a few ways: 
1) Loot drops feel really lame, and there is a major reason for this. Your chance of getting rare loot has a lot to do with how many lucky dice you have found, and how far you are through the game. This can leave new players feeling like the loot pool isn't rewarding. But after getting into the mechanic it does play into my completionist mentality and does finally manage to win me over in the end.
2) The soundtrack is designed with the theme in mind; it feels a little airy and mystical while previous entries felt energetic, mysterious and exciting. I also feel the volume in this game is really low and I cant hear dialogue clearly even at full volume. 
3) There aren't really any main characters in this one, the idea is that you make a custom character to play with. And while this can open up some creativity it can feel devoid of the personality from previous entries.
4) Being a mock DND session, there is a lot of story changes happening all around you as Tina dictates the action, sometimes it's really fun and exciting, while other times it feels like a cop-out to having the writers plan out the story better.
5) Random encounters on the overworld map are a nod to more classic games but they make the smooth gameplay of the Borderlands series feel clunky. I am learning to be thankful for the traditional open world fighting the game still has to offer. 

The levels are fun, imaginative and well designed. The spells are interesting and unique, albeit a little weak. The classes are all really fun to play around with and feel powerful. The story telling is intentionally a little awkward but still plenty funny and interesting.",1685982244,1685982244,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

New Weapon types
Spells

Bad Weapon Design <Crossbow Weapons
too many useless Spells
Bad Class mod clutter
Meele feeling weak and sluggish slow
Giving Brick a Skirt

That's plenty of game and honestly it got a bit samey after a while anyway. After about halfway through you've pretty much seen all the enemy types in the game so the combat can get repetitive. That said it is also very fun if you're just after more Borderlands. The inclusion of spells is a nice change from grenades for the franchise, though I'll admit I pretty much used only 1 or 2 different spell types because having to hold down a button for several seconds looking at the point you want to cast a spell leaves you a vulnerable so got annoying. Good variety of classes and more interesting perk upgrades than usual.

Now the bad stuff. The game is way too easy. I rarely died and if I did it was because I missed a jump or accidentally bashed an exploding barrel thinking it was a regular one. Most boss fights were over within a matter of seconds with no strategy needed to defeat them. Ammo crates are spammed every 5 metres you walk so you never run out of ammo and have to change weapon so you only do so when you get bored. The UI is pretty poor. For example, to put a way point down on the map you think it would make sense that you could just click on the map where your mouse cursor is right? Well apparently not, because you have to drag your mouse across the screen to move the map cursor to the point on the map you want the way point to be. It's really awkward. Also the characters in the game apart from Tiny Tina are really lame and annoying. Not quite as bad as in BL3 but not far off. It was cringe inducing stuff.

There's a good game to be had, but the incessant chatter from cringey dialogue and laughably easy combat makes it easy to forget that the core gun play is the only thing holding this game together.",1685756479,1685756479,True,36,3,0.679993867874145508,0,True,False,False

5+ hrs in with two characters.... So far this is a pretty fun game. I choose to avoid the Chaotic Great Edition (bought for my child on Xbox) and opted instead for buying the DLC independently which ended up giving a little more for the cost and I still saved money. I love the DND homebrew feel, and the story line is just a good make believe fantasy story that's super basic and fun. So far I've shot thru tons of undead and would recommend at the point of these initial thoughts. One thing I [i] do not like [/i] are the menu systems which do feel a little clunky.

* Funny writing.
* Beyond-imaginative world.
* By-the-book exploration.
* Beautiful graphics and good sounds.

Cons:
* The whole frikking gunplay. I mean, what's even going on here. Normal difficulty: A 5th-level, absolutely lowly mob takes 2 headshots from a unique 5th-level sniper rifle with flat damage bigger than anything else. A 12th-level melee fighter with the biggest, rarest, two-handed weapon and all skill points invested in a melee tree still has to smash three times into a common mob to kill it. Submachine guns have generally 3-5x less flat damage than a pistol (!!). Okay, I get it. Supposedly, that should be balanced by the rate of fire. What a joke. What good is the rate of fire if I have to empty half a clip into one single mob.  Don't get me even started on tougher enemies. Weapons in general are either powerful but shoot in ways that are weird and cumbersome (whereas enemies move to and fro as if on cocaine) or are shooting straight but are ""rightfully"" much weaker. 


You might say this gets better later on, when you supplement the weapons with passives and abilities. No, it does not. Once in 5 hours you get a weapon that, by some miracle, operates on sane levels at least two more hours, before it becomes under-par, or an inventory mod that could technically make one more skill work wonders if only you had those other two mods that would complement it, and you would search for them another 5 hours, and once you get those, the mods are already outperformed, and... AAAAARRGGGH!

This was most of my experience with Tiny Tina's. I am no stranger to FPSs; I've always done my successful builds in many ARPGs or FPS/RPG hybrids to satisfactory levels. I've played and mostly loved everything Borderlands with some exceptions of some weird choices in BIII. This... this is just no.

I finished the game because of the scenery, humor, and imagination. But gameplay-wise it was a frikking chore to begin with and ended the same.",1656750272,1685054114,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- Purchased during half-off sale.

Yay: 
- RPG elements galore.
- Interesting character classes.
- Random loot generation feels good. 
- Combat feels good.
- Nice character customization; lots of cosmetics that unlock through game play.
- Some of the visuals are legitimately breathtaking.
- Nice voice acting, though the writing does the cast a disservice.
- Runs surprisingly well; no technical issues thus far, only the occasional wacky rag doll physics.

Meh:
- The NPCs are bland; majority of characters severely lack in personality, perhaps with the exception of a few cameo characters from Borderlands.
- The writing is bland, and some dialogue drags on far longer than it needs to.
- Excessive use of invisible walls in some places.
- Mimics.

If I compare this gameplay to BL2 overlevels, BL2 scales much better. Story-wise this isn't as fun as BL2 was, but it has its moments! I do not regret buying this, it was fun for many hours, but the endgame lacks content: You just grind chambers after another, and after getting around chaos level 60 (these are end game levels you get by completing chaos trials) the bosses scale much more than you do. Trash mobs are not the problem, but some bosses are. They are not impossible, but they just take so much time to complete that it isn't worth the invested time anymore.",1684853608,1684853608,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story of the game follows the familiar Borderlands format, with two caveats: there's basically no NPCs that follow you through the story, which is incredibly short. Sure, Tiny Tina and the Bad Guy narrate your adventures, but you're not regularly interacting with any recurring NPCs and there's very few familiar faces scattered about. For example, I would've expected Roland and Mr. Torgue to play significant parts in the game, what with their relationships with Tina. NPCs, in general, are entirely forgettable, with some minor exceptions.

While the overworld map that connects all of the different zones is a neat idea and I like the various items scattered across it, I feel that it is very lacking in execution and is thoroughly undermined by the fast travel system. Either the overworld or the fast travel system should not exist. Additionally, the approximately four or five maps that are there for the so-called combat/random encounters in the overworld get incredibly boring, incredibly fast. 

Speaking of maps, they are all very generic fantasy natural-scenery maps: there's a bit of grasslands, woods, city, sea floor and pirate beach. These are all fine and dandy, but the variety is significantly lacking in comparison to prior Borderlands titles. There's no volcano or underground biomes, for example, and what maps are there are very unimpressive visually.

The maps feature four primary factions: skeletons, greenskins, fungi and coiled (naga). None of the four factions have distinct mechanics or gameplay elements; there's nothing along the lines of skeletaurs, goliaths or hyperion bots at least before whatever is the equivalent of TVHM in this game. Technically, there's also pirates and bandits, but these are barely even visually distinct from skeletons, let alone mechanically. Scattered between the forces of the main factions are some fantastical beasts, such as wyverns and dogfish, which do distinguish themselves from one another.

With the fantasy theme come spells, which replace grenades and come with an automatic recharge mechanic. While some spells are incredibly powerful and feel great to activate as they can destroy an entire wave of enemies and put a huge dent even into badasses, most spells are lackluster and usually worse than firing a gun. The variety of spells is pretty good, but I wish that anything besides fissures actually had any ""oomph"" at all. For example, meteors come with a significant cast delay and have _tiny_ impact areas by comparison and absurd recharge times to boot.

Alongside spells there are the class-based skills. There are exactly three interesting skills: polymorph, invisibility and reaper of bones, though ambi-hextrous deserves an honorable mention for conceding that the spells are strictly more interesting than the action skills. Everything else is of the format ""press button to deal damage"", which is confusing at best considering how easily many of the action skills in Borderlands titles could have been reskinned with a fantasy theme. 

Skill modifiers also do not exist, which combined with the above leads to every class feeling basically the same despite having extremely distinct themes. Your choices are to either shoot at stuff or hit them with your sword/axe/mace. None of the skill trees feel like a substantial change to how I play the game.

As there is only a single skill tree for every class, an opportunity to ""multiclass"" is presented. This essentially means slapping on the passives from another class to your initially chosen class. Don't forget to google the skill trees before you lock in, because the game does not actually give you any indication as to what the choice entails beyond a ""this class is good at fire damage"" when choosing and I don't know whether it is even possible to choose again. Nor do I really care, because why would I when there is essentially no difference?

You can freely choose your character's body shape, pronoun and voice independent of one another, which is nice, I guess, if I cared about any of that and if all of them weren't so incredibly bland. I have always enjoyed the various quips, puns and dialogue of the Borderlands player characters, but that does not materialize here.

All characters look essentially the same and outfits — the visually most distinctive part of your character — are tied to your class mod. There seems to only be a small handful of variants, all of which look the same. If you thought you could be a robot-ninja-pirate, think again. The color/pattern alterations you can make to your outfit are also incredibly bland and require you to find them as drops from enemies or from collectibles scattered around the world. If you thought Borderlands 3 had bad customization options with the ugly-ass head and body options, you really don't want to see what Wonderlands has to offer.

TL;DR: it's bland. Buying and playing the DLC again is a better use of your time and money.",1684605541,1684605541,False,5,0,0.548823058605194092,0,True,False,False

After around a year I bought this again on sale for pretty cheap in my region. Now attempting a play-through with the redux mod. This fixes many aspects of the game-play and helps it stand out more from the borderlands series. Still far from perfect but I can definitely recommend this game exclusively with redux and at a discounted price now. It has a more consistent difficulty, weapon usage, movement system and overall just feels more enjoyable to play. Still would not recommend this game standalone or at full or even half price. I did not buy the DLC this time around either, they have poor ratings.


UPDATED 14 September, 2022
I refunded the game. The Good: Super satisfying gun-play, definitely more polished than previous borderlands games, graphics hold up well even on medium. That's it.
The Bad: My god is this just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bland. The gun variety is tiny, the story feels short, the difficulty feels oddly easy, the overall game-play/mission flow is weird, and never feels like you get a break or stop shooting, pacing overall is just bad. It also just feels identical to borderlands, the only fantasy in this game is the art style and perk points, everything else is unchanged in regards to mechanics, I expected a spin-off and just got borderlands with a texture pack if this was a DLC Id let it slide, but a standalone full price game, haha, not at all worth it. Want to play a fantasy fps looter shooter? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't, pick a genre please god


ORIGINAL 28 June, 2022
Not worth the price at all. Not innovative, feels like a normal borderlands game but with even less purpose and reason to progress. This is not a spin-off, this is borderlands, no new game-play elements or any reason to say this is an RPG more than borderlands already is. Additionally, I just found the performance abysmal: RTX 3070 running at medium to have over 60 fps is awful.

So you essentially become a one man/woman/? MAELSTROM. This doesn't even say anything about your personal abilities as well as spells you'll be slinging along with gun/swordplay. See what I'm saying? You become a one man wrecking crew.

(As a really important aside when it comes to including our friends, THERE ARE TONS OF OPTIONS FOR THE LGBTQ? community. Probably the most I've ever seen in a game. And it always makes me feel great to know I supported a company that cares about ALL their players.)

It's Borderlands with a fantasy twist.
Not much else to say really. If you like the Borderlands style, this will appeal to you, if not, well I think you're missing out.

As it's pretty much just a Borderlands game, I'll only point out what would be different:
1. you start off with only one skill tree for your class. You will unlock the ability to choose a skill tree from another class later on. After you finish the main story, you can change your second skill tree to any other class in the game.
2. There is no New game plus or ""True Vault Hunter mode"". I'm a bit disappointed by that. The game is pretty easy, and I was hoping for a meaningful challenge to work through.
3. Melee weapons. On the other games, melee is an afterthought, except for maybe a couple characters, and even then it's practically useless.  In Wonderlands, you can actually build a character around melee AND melee weapons are a specific item class, complete with their own stats. Some bosses you still need to use guns on because you cannot reach them, but it's a big improvement that I hope they keep in future titles.
4. The Overworld. As the whole thing is framed as a game of Bunker's and Badasses DM'd by Tina, there is a sort of map that you can traverse between areas. There are some sidequests and other things you can do on the overworld. Overall it's an alright concept that did it's job.

That's all I have to say.

The story is ok with a lot of the humour that you would expect and some old favorites (or hated chars...hehe) returning for some banter along a board game, its not a bad move since this has been done in BL 2 with great success. However, it is quite shallow and since it is a board game it does not really engage me in the story, but it was ok, nothing special at all but ok.

Gunplay is great as usual, builds are fun to explore etc. But.... the DLCs are so bad I do not even have words for it, next time just add more items in the game with the patch and skip the teedious quests that takes away the tempo of the game and offers zero in interesting lore. The DLCs are pure shir, sorry for the language. They are all annoying to do compared to BL content overall and there is ZERO story or rewards to care about apart from some new items. 

Late game farm is not terrible. I will for sure spend more time doing more builds etc. But keeping track of gear in the stash with no possibility to word search etc. is a bit of a joke by now. Having multiple chars with one bank with sortiing and scrolling being the only options for overview is beyond bad.

That's my main problem with the game: The actually written content you get is good, but it's clear that it was padded with a lot of same-ish encounters.

[b][u]COMBAT (4/10)[/u]
-Extremely repetitive. You'll fight through the same combat arenas over and over again whilst clearing out bandit camps and dungeons etc.
-There's a solid range in weapons and magic, but again, over time this will become repetitive and you'll genuinely find yourself getting bored. 

[b][u]STORY (2/10)[/u]
-The story seems like it's tailored for an audience of five year old's or teens with the sense of humour of a toddler. For me, it didn't really draw me in that much as the boss fights were lackluster along with the rest of the combat. Nothing felt really special. 
-There's an abundance of left-wing wokeness in this game. You have trans/gay pirates, pronouns, gender-neutral terminology, so on so forth. I don't play a game to be surrounded by political propaganda.

[b][u]THE OPEN WORLD/EXPLORATION (6/10)[/u]
-The Overworld is poorly designed and looks terrible. 'Nuff said. 
-The area's you'll go into all unique in their own way, and host a lot of side-quests (which I'll touch on later in this review), which is somewhat of a good thing. 
-These unique areas can be quite large and repetitive however, so you'll find yourself getting bored after only a few hours of playing. 

[b][u]SIDE-QUESTS (3/10)[/u]
-The side quests feel the same as the main story - very plain and boring. ""Go from A to B to collect or kill XYZ"". You'll fight against the same enemies spouting the same two voice lines they have over and over again. Very boring and tedious. 

[b][u]ACHIEVEMENTS (6/10)[/u]
-I've been unlocking a few achievements just by playing through the main story and the side quests, but I've taken the time to look at the rest of the achievements for 100% completion. If you look at my profile you'll realise that I'm a fan of 100% games, but I don't think I'll be able to bring myself to do it for this one. The niche achievements look very boring and way too grind-filled. At this time I'm not planning on completing this game with all achievements, but if that changes I'll be sure to update this review. 

[b][u]VOICE ACTING (8/10[/u]
-The voice acting in this game was good, done by some familiar names such as Andy Samberg. At the end of the day you can't blame the cast for bad writing. They did their job well for this game and how bad the writing was. Hats off to them. 
-You can see the full cast here https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14831458/

[b][u]SUMMARY/OVERALL SCORE = 4.8/10[/u]
-I purchased this game at 33% off and would not recommend anyone to buy it at full price. The game was enjoyable for the first few hours, but after that everything this game provided became repetitive, and the cringe writing became unbearable. The voice acting was good, and the weapons/spells were mostly enjoyable, but everything else about this game is just plain boring.

While it's certainly not as good as Borderlands 2 or even 3, if you enjoyed the theme of the Assault on the Dragon Keep DLC you'll probably like this game. But otherwise, you could skip this entry into the series. My main issue with the game, same as BL3, is the writing. What made the original DLC work was that it was shorter and still felt relavent to BL2. he jokes didn't get a chance to feel repetitive or annoying, the story was connected to the main series and had emotion. Here, about halfway through the campaign, I was begging the characters to shut up and stop going on about the power of friendship and unicorns. Everything else, gameplay wise, is the same as BL3 just reskinned to fit the DnD aesthetic. If you want to do tedious side quests, delivering items to NPCs or fighting 50 skeletons, you could just play one of the previous installments. There's little replay value, especially seeing as the campaign's dialogue and writing is so poor. 

The addition of spells and the expanded character classes was a nice change of pace to the main series of games, 
be interested to see if any of that carries over into future games. The ""guns"" shooting arrows instead of bullets and having slightly different physics because of that is a fun twist on fps as well. But sadly the game doesn't offer much challenge in terms of combat unless you play on the highest tier of difficulty.

Shortest campaign I've ever played and not real push to replay it once it's finished,

I cannot believe I paid 40$ for this.

It's just gotta worse the more I play and there are simply no fixes.

Characters are great and extremely funny, in some ways excelling the already-outstanding characters from Borderlands.  Very, very well done.

Gameplay is essentially Borderlands but with a Medieval twisting.  Unfortunately this isn't quite as addictive as the basically identical gameplay in the Borderlands series, I'm not quite sure why.

There are so many different things wrong with how this plays that I feel like some play testing would have caught a lot of the problems this game exhibits. This game tried several new things with the borderlands looter shooter formula and some worked and some did not. As I said, this game I initially enjoyed, but borderlands endgame revolves around farming bosses to get certain items to make a build and play on a harder difficulty thats where the flaws show the worst.

In order to talk about what the game did wrong we need to talk about the parts that worked first. This game is set in a world of magic, so grenades have been changed to spells and it works so well. With grenades working so well, its important to get spells that work with your build. In addition, the class trees worked well for customizing your character and it let you mix and match what you liked out of two classes. These were the two major changes that i think worked well, but their inclusion also exasperates the problems with this game. New rolls were added to accomidate these changes such as ability, all, and spell categories, each with straight damage, cooldown, crit chance, ect added drastically to the pool items could roll from.

The endgame, which is where everyone is headed at some point and where builds come together, is where by far the majority of issues are. The game includes some collectathons which feel mandatory and almost all of them need to be done per character, making trying different characters a complete pain in the butt. The next problem has to do with the addition of generic class mods, the addition of stats supporting spells, and adding more slots for rng on most equipment. These problems are a direct extension of the good changes they made above, but as i said, could have been found and resolved if they had tested these changes during the development of the game. All of these result in requiring every playthrough to be a completionist playthrough just to actually starting farming your gear, and once you do theres an order of magnatude more rng to deal with before you can get reasonable gear to support your build. 

The rng in this game is the biggest problem to this game and is by far my biggest reason for not recommending it for people. The addition of new potential stats and extra slots those stats can be on due to the class generalization changes mean that even just wanting a good rolled item means getting the legendary item to drop, then trying to get that items stats decently rolled, which is darn near impossible when you need to roll 3 to 5 stats an item, and each of those stats has dozens of possibilities and you are looking for a specific set of them in order to have it viable for your build really made it an rng hell. If the item drops and it doesnt have any stat you want then you have to keep farming in hopes of that item even dropping. In the event that you do actually get your desired drop with a stat or two you like, the end game introduces another layer of rng, the chaos level. Now you need to farm everything all over again but now that item with a small chance of having the stats you want now also needs to drop with an chaos modifier which is higher rng based on how high in the chaos chambers you are. Its a complete grindfest with little hope of getting the gear you want and even less hope of getting it to drop multiple times as you progress through the chaos chamber leveling. When the top tier of chaos modifier was released it was only 1% chance, so a 1 in 100 chance that your required legendary(or legendaries) for your build upon actually dropping, and then dropping enough to have good enough stats, would actually be a viable end game upgrade. Its just far too much rng, most people do not have the time or paitence to spend hundreds of hours farming per character, and thats where the game lost me. I'm all for farming in a looter shooter, but when it changes from getting an item to drop a few times and taking the best one for your build to needing that item to drop hundreds of times to get something remotely good that starts to feel hopeless for completing a build.

Lastly theres the actual end game content which is sadly lacking. Unlike other borderlands installments you dont really farm bosses, you end up just doing whats called a chaos chamber. Initially these are kinda fun, but after a few the novelty wares off... but theres no better way to farm gear so you are stuck doing them. This concept would probably be better if it wasnt directly tied to rng hell. In addition the game lacks the borderlands traditional raid type bosses so its just farming story bosses and farming chaos chambers in the hopes of any usable loot.

My enjoyment of this game ended when i started farming the endgame. I felt the story was nothing special, but entertaining in its own way. If you wanted play through the story because you felt you wanted a looter shooter type game and you have already played the other borderlands games then this is a fun game to play through. However if you plan to do the endgame content you will find yourself in a joyless unending grind that will devour your soul and all enjoyment you had for the game. If this review ignored the endgame I would probably give it a 6 out of 10, but accounting for the endgame I give this game a 3 out of 10, theres loot grinding, and then theres whatever hell this is.",1683188499,1683188616,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

After the fustercluck that is BL3 and all its controversy it's nice to actually get a break from the series. Sure, Wonderlands uses Borderlands elements at its core, and yet it feels like a fresh experience. It shows the potential for the Borderlands series to become something more and explore new areas; perhaps even Wonderlands can be its own spin-off series with sequels.


[b]The writing[/b]
I know someone is going to point out that ""ackshually"" this is Borderlands 2.5, but besides Assault on Dragon Keep, this is far from being anything like BL2, so from a features standpoint 3.5 is more accurate. Technicalities aside, the game takes place between 2 and 3, but Borderlands universe is definitely not the main focus here, and that is what makes this feel fresh. If we had just got another Pre-Sequel, it would have been a lore dump that could have passed off as a DLC, but because it decides to do its own thing it is better than that. To embrace the fantasy element the manufacturers as well as gear have been renamed to better suit that, and of course that doesn't stop Tina from adding guns to a fantasy story!

Unlike Assault on Dragon Keep it is not a reimagining of an existing story it is its own story. It's on the same level as any other fantasy game in terms of cliches (you are the chosen one, etc.), but it is shaken up by the D and D aspect, which adds a sort of 4th wall element, that compliments the gameplay and writing. The villain is much better than the twins, nowhere near Handsome Jack level, but is a significant improvement over those two. Lots of humour sprinkled throughout, I think anyone expecting something more serious will be annoyed, but consider the context; you are playing a board game, Handsome Jack is dead, there is no reason for things to be serious. Do what the characters are doing and just focus on having fun!


[b]Gameplay[/b]
The gameplay of course has taken on the more modernised FPS elements that appeared in BL3, but it still is Borderlands at its core, as there is no shortage of looting, farming, and trying new builds. Speaking of which we now have a sub-class system that allows you to pick a second class in addition to your current one, once you complete a certain mission, allowing a combination of 15 classes (there is a new class on the horizon, that raises that number to 21!) This makes the replay value huge, and I know some people (like myself) will explore every single combination as we have fun playing this game for hours on end. I am worried that so many class combinations will lead to poor balance in the long run (i.e. some combinations might be fun, but weak), but so far I am very happy with the balance, as gear seems to be primary and class skills secondary.

Wonderlands has added a difficulty setting (not talking about instanced loot from BL3, as in literal easy, normal, hard). Naturally as a veteran I am playing on the hardest, but I guess things will feel much more like a challenge at max level + Chaos levels. So far just like BL3 I feel like the difficulty is lacking compared to BL2. Don't get me wrong BL2's difficulty had flaws, but I am so used to that challenge now (especially as my main was Krieg), that this feels a bit easy in comparison. It's definitely not a cake walk though and will be enjoyable to everyone.


[b]Epic exclusivity[/b]
No matter which side you are on, one thing is very clear, the only reason the game came in 3 months instead of 6 is a lack of sales. There is no other possibility. This is a good thing. Epic and 2K's anti-consumer practices are catching up to them and by being patient, we are making progress.

[b]Major downsides that need to be addressed[/b]
- Endgame content is severely lacking:
                [b]a)[/b] Chaos Chambers are encounters that you have to do over and over. They increased the Chaos Level multiple times and it is now at 100, this is way too high and takes forever to do.
                [b]b)[/b] No new game+ or ability to reset playthrough
                [b]c)[/b] DLC are short combat encounters

- Farming is the worst it has ever been:
                [b]a)[/b] I see what they were going for with Loot Luck, which is keeping farming an endgame thing, but the implementation is terrible. If you are not maximising Loot Luck you will not get good drops. Problem is you need to get all dice (which is a chore, but thankfully apply to all characters), loot luck bonuses from gear (more on that later), hit max level and increase your chaos levels. Needs to be rebalanced to rely less on dice and chaos levels, which give huge multipliers
                [b]b)[/b] Class mod farming is awful there are 21 unique combinations of classes. For class mods this is bad because for class mods that includes whether the class is primary or secondary which doubles that number to 42! They should make it so that only the classes you are using affect the class mods that spawn.
                [b]c)[/b] Getting good stats on gear is awful. Class mods, amulets and trinkets all have a chance of spawning with additional stats, this would not be so bad, if there was not already the issues that class mods currently have, and additionally as an example if you wanted a melee focused amulet and ring it can also roll gun focused bonuses, despite the main stat being melee. There is farming and then there is torture.
                [b]d[/b] Loot luck as a bonus stat is evil, it forces you to optimise your build or get better loot and was never an issue in other titles. In the end game not optimising your build is a bad idea, as the difficulty curve is insane.


[b]Overall[/b]

Is this game even out? It feels like beta at this point. Ui constantly bugs. 1. Two options in front end ui are highlighted 2. there are no icons for all or some items in coop 3. character glitches on altairs or small places with chests and other assets with collision 4. random freezes when somebody is shooting in coop (you are forced to kill process) 5. guns that stop functioning unless you throw them them out of inventory 5. random lags not related to ones internet connection

What the hell is going on?! This game was released almos a year ago. Shame on you GEARBOX. I was so hyped after 1 day in this game. The second day was already a disaster. How this studio can release such an unpolished product and let known bugs to exist for a year?!?!??!?!?!? Baldur III is in better state than this.

However, the game's storyline can feel disjointed and lacking in coherence at times, and the humor may not be to everyone's taste. Additionally, some players may find the game's reliance on RNG-based loot drops frustrating, as it can make progression feel slow and tedious.

Despite these shortcomings, Tiny Tina's Wonderland is still a fun and enjoyable game that will appeal to fans of the RPG genre. The game's vibrant visuals and engaging combat system are sure to provide hours of entertainment, even if the story and progression can be a bit uneven.

I definitely think if you are a fan of Borderlands games you should give this a go, but only if its on sale. $40 if your a fan of borderlands $30 if your not.

The main cast though is very strong and I honestly think can be brought into BL4 if they wanted to. Skill tree and skills are both a bit varied but at the same time kind of shallow. Alot of skills dont feel unique and this is probably due to the secondary class which on paper sound good but feel like it doesn't hit the mark for me. Gunplay is still amazing and keeps the same gunplay from BL3 which is both a good and bad thing, on one hand its the best gunplay in the series and on the other hand it feels like I am play a very overprices BL3 dlc. The unique gun types are ok like wave shotguns of crossbows but they feel like a lateral upgrade to their BL3 counterpart. Melee to be honest is forgettable and it was suppose to be a selling point.

**I played through the game with the Redux mod installed
Most fun I've had in a Borderlands game since the pre-sequel. The classes are interesting and fun, and multi-classing especially gives some really interesting options when it comes to character creation. If you enjoy the gameplay loop of Borderlands games, you'll probably enjoy this one. One nice thing is that the game isn't too long so I managed to finish all the sidequests before getting bored. No comment on the endgame loop since I haven't really done much of that. 

The writing isn't as bad as people make it out to be - at the very least it's better than the trainwreck that was Borderlands 3. This game really doubles down on the wacky and zany part of Borderlands writing.. and I think it works really well. I think at least they were able to give the supporting characters some fun personalities. There are also some neat ties to the lore of Borderlands 2.

The one major complaint I have is that I ran into very frequent game stuttering when I played through the game. My game will freeze from anywhere between half a second to 5 whole seconds randomly. My hardware is quite good and I don't have this issue when playing any other game.

End of rant.

Oh yeah, the rest of the game. Well, err, having played every other Borderlands game  (other than the weird Tales stuff), players are used to the ""real"" game starting in New Game+ mode. This is fine as the relatively poor loot luck and scrimping for points for your build is only a mild irritant for the initial run. This game appears to be calibrated in a roughly equivalent manner, but for some Bob-forsaken reason, THERE IS NO FUCKING NEW GAME+ MODE. 

Yeah, you read that right, none. The much-loved mayhem of the NG+ run is completely missing. This makes it feel like a) half a game b) an insipid mess.

Yes, I get that you'd need more more voice work to swing it- luckily only the core cast and not the terrible, terrible NPCs (I thought Dick Van Dyke was no longer with us, but his gift for accent lives on). 

However, those extra voice lines would be a pleasant change the second time around.. and it's not like you'd need a lot of effort, a lot of the writing feels quite thin and phoned-in too, since BL2. At this point, the general level of the ""humour"" is to scream ""BUTTS"" at a high volume, it's hardly going to need an army of Pulitzer winners to extend it for a second play-through.

Yes, the shooting flows beautifully- the spells instead of 'nades are an excellent change, too. How great all of that would be, in a complete Borderlands with NG+ and maybe some chaos levels. It's just a shame that this is a phoned in half-a-game affair. 

If you buy it, only do so at a very steep discount. I would also suggest skipping all the DLCs, with the possibly exception of ""Shattering Spectreglass"", which has a new class. All the rest of the ""new content"" is basically slapdash little arenas. Again. You should absolutely check out the Steam review page for the Season Pass though, it's hilarious reading.

I really love all the different guns BUT the loot leveling system feels like it is broken. 
Several times during the game, I still had weapons 10 level lower than me (sometimes even green/blue) because new weapons my level was never/very rarely better. This is especially felt during the end game when max level has been reached and you take on the chaos mode (harder enemies for better loot). 
Borderlands 3 I felt did it right and the higher level of weapons could quickly be felt in that game.
In Tiny Tina, I could never feel/see it at all. Chaos mode increases the challenge, but the “chaos” weapons you have a chance to get were never better than my standard ones. By chaos level 20 (out of 100) the enemies close to +400% health and do +40% damage. But your weapons haven’t caught up even a tiny bit. So now you are just trying to kill “spongy” enemies who can kill you A LOT easier.

I like collecting achievements and 90% of all achievements in Tiny Tina you get from the story or are easy to do stuff. BUT the “purchase every inventory upgrade” achievement is really annoying when the end game isn’t better.
There is no special currency to farm in this game for them. You buy it with your gold/cash like everything else you want in the game. But 65 hours into the game, Max level, collected everything (lucky dices, poems, etc.) I have only maxed out 1 of the 12 upgrades. A quick google shows this will take around 200-300 million to buy everything. To put it into perspective, a maxed out inventory with average selling level price is around 10k per item so about 500k. You only need to grind that  400-500 times and you should have all upgrades. Ohh and by the way the upgrades feel kind of useless anyway. I never ran out of ammo at any point in the game (primary use was pistol or assault) except for the sniper and rocket launcher.

What I really love about this game with no back sides was:
-the Coop as usual was fun and with loot set to “cooperation”. Each player gets their own loot and can’t see the other players’ loot. No fighting and no dividing, everything you see is yours.  
-the character type voices. You can choose between several types of voices and on a slider decide your characters pitch. My SO had made a copy of Thor which was hilarious with the Gruff voice and the slider at the deepest setting. I had chosen the weirder “strange” type and much lighter voice which just made the exchanges with NPC’s a lot more fun when we never knew which of our characters were going to answer and with what.

All in all I really loved the game. I wished the end game would have been better to keep me coming back but sadly not in this game. The story and the changes from the other borderlands games have been hit on the head in my opinion. But it has some downsides that stopped me from putting 100-200+ hours into it like I probably would have.

Ended up getting it.

I am not sure what y'all are smoking, but Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is MILES better than BL3, 

""Oh Borderlands 3 has so much more content than Tiny Tina's Wonderlands"" Mate the content in Borderlands 3 is utterly dreadful so I'm not sure already how that's a good thing? Anyways.

-The story is better than BL3,

-The humour is WAYY better, it's still not that funny but I havent smiled even a single time playing BL3 so that's that,

-Characters are less cringe than BL3, they're still cringe, but not as bad as BL3,

-Tiny Tina's VA work is, as usual, pretty stellar, which is good because you'll be hearing her talk the entire game,

-Graphics are... Well they're fine honestly,

-The new mechanics are cool as fuck

Now it DOES have issues:

-Game is WAAAAY too easy, even on highest difficulty, it's not even funny, I have not met a single enemy that truly posed a threat to me in any way shape or form,

-This one's subjective I guess, but the game suffers from a very... ""Neo-liberal"" humour, what I mean by this is, expect lots of Eat the rich, respect pronouns, communism is good, everyone in the game is LGBT I am not joking about this, 

Which is made especially ironic when you remember Randy fucking Pitchford is at the helm, but then again, this isn't very surprising, these kinds of people usually have skeletons in their closets.

-Buttstallion... For the love of god Gearbox I am on my KNEES begging you to leave that joke in BL2, it was kinda funny once, get over it.

I could go on more about it all but eh,

And now, the longer review you will almost certainly not read...

GAMEPLAY
Just like Borderlands 3, the actual gameplay in Wonderlands is fantastic. It features all the QOL improvements of the previous title (like damage scaling so that you can play with anyone at any level, sliding, and not getting stuck on every single little piece of map geometry) and combines them with some new D&D-esque mechanics and the chaos chamber, which operates like a randomized dungeon arena.

STORYTELLING, CHARACTERS, AND HUMOR
The story is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but this is very much not a game to be recommended for its story. Most of the time it feels very lukewarm, not pissing me off, but not wowing me either. Exceptions are any quest involving Mr. Torgue or Claptrap [spoiler](Especially the ending of Torgue's main story quest: there is just no topping that)[/spoiler], the Pirate Words scroll, seducing the door, and Peasant-Ass Peasant. Like almost every Borderlands game, the jokes are very much hit or miss. The characters are often referential jokes, and they are also very much hit or miss.

GLITCHES AND BUGS
Had a bug where the game would freeze for about 20 seconds once after launching and spawning in a map, but that may have been due to my graphics settings. I never did look into trying to fix it. Mildly annoying more than anything. Also had the game crash twice without error message and without warning. Once in the middle of a chaos chamber I had reached the final boss of. Kept my gold and everything I got up to that point, but I was still pissed because I wanted to finish the chamber. That seems to have been due to graphics settings because I lowered them and didn't have a crashing issue after that.

SEASON PASS
I'm not buying it at this time. It seems overpriced for what you get.

Naturally extends and modifies the core loops and mechanics to feel ""RPG-ish"" (grenades are replaced with spells, you can get equip-able rings, necklaces, etc with their own effects).
And it fleshes out Tina's character a bit more. (Note this game takes place before BL3, so [spoiler]Tina is still a child[/spoiler])

The ""plot"" and character dialog is much better written this time, compared to (let's be honest) BL3's writing quality significantly decreasing about mid-way through the story. And to a lesser extent, the character dialog and interactions too.

Also a new element is added, and the element vs health type is now explicitly shown in game (though per-species resistances/vulnerabilities you still have to discover for yourself).

Another thing I hope Gearbox keeps in the future is showing the parts on equipment that gives the modifications to stats. And maybe expanding it a bit to show more (e.g. there are many more parts to a gun that can have modifiers than the in-game component list. Anyone who has dabbled with the game's/gane save's data structures should know this full well)
Also, TTW only has this for guns and shields(?), but it would be great to see it for more equipment types too.
This kind of transparency into inner game mechanics is a good thing.

Another change I like is that the level cap is still what it was on release, 40. This avoids issues with enemy and/or player scaling formulas going a bit out of control and making the game exponentially punishing with every enemy with ludicrous amounts of HP that previous games had. (Though it does lead to the opposite problem, as discussed below)
And they finally fixed the side-mission level issue; all enemies and quests scale to your current level. (Though this does have the unfortunate side effect of incentives you to do all sidequests after max cap, for max level quest equipment)

Side-quest reward equipment (with a short list of exceptions) is no longer a one-time thing!
The rewards (again, except a few) get added to the pool of things that can show up in vending machines, albiet with a pretty low probability (and pretty steep costs).
This means if you do get a special reward at too low of a level, you will (eventually) have a chance to get it again at your current level.

The small list of complaints I have (so far):
[list]
[*] At max level and a good set of equipment, enemies are complete joke. Really only super badasses and bosses have any real chance of giving you a problem. [spoiler]But secret bosses in the chaos chamber are quite threatening, so credit for that[/spoiler].
You can kind of fix this using Chaos modes (this game's equivalent to Mayhem mode), but you need to raise it a good chunk to start getting ""regular"" overworld stuff to be a challenge a bit. And raising that level is in an easy to overlook, undocumented (in-game),  grindy session.
[*] Similar to this, no ""new game+"" option. Granted, with a level cap of only 40, this wouldn't actually add all that much replay value, but it would be nice to have the option anyways.
[*] The world map/[spoiler]board[/spoiler] matches very well thematically, but isn't quite as satisfying as a ""real"" overworld. (This one I will give some slack since TTW was supposed to be a sort of ""side-ish project"" during pandemic)
[*] Not enough ""natural"" enemy spawns, combat is a bit too sparse when not on an active mission with scripted spawns.
[*] STORY SPOILER: [spoiler]Tina never got the callout/wake up call she needs about her being too ""clingy"" to the other non-RPG protagonists. She can't make the world stop just because she wants companionship badly. Yes, Tina has [i]severe[/i] abandonment problems (which if you know your BL2 lore, is completely understandable). But while she can get a loyal, consistent friends/authority figures (BL1 and BL2 cast at this point in the story), the world will not halt regardless of how severe the issues she may have. That is something Tina is going to have to grasp at some point.[/spoiler]

None of these are game-breaking; I still thoroughly enjoyed and continue to enjoy the game!

The end-game chaos runs are a bit of a pain once you get past level 10 or so, if you're not willing to do a lot of optimization, but hey, that's for the real hardcore nerds anyway.
(Please don't hurt me, you nerds are wonderful and deserve all the optimization you want, but when I'm forced to hold down the shoot button at a boss for half an hour straight, I get a bit bored...)

All in all, a great addition to the franchise, I'm looking forward to more!

Thank you Gearbox, you have genuinely saved my sanity and my life as a consequence during ""the-times-that-shall-not-be-mentioned"", and you deserve all the love you can get. *kissing noises*",1681667395,1681667395,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Borderlands was my entry-point into the looter-shooter genre, BL2 (and TFTB) is one of my favorite games of all time, but BL3 pretty nastily killed most of the joy I found in the franchise. The gunplay there had everything I'd ever dreamed of for this series, but the soul was just left to dust.

Luckily, the Wonderlands help reel it back in.

This game contains the feel of BL3 and houses an incredibly solid improvement on the narrative design and writing, yet also brings new and original gameplay ideas to the table that, while not drastically changing the core foundation, propel the series and franchise forward in interesting ways.

If you're a Borderlands fan and want to scratch that Gearbox-specific looter-shooter itch, but also actually enjoy the time you spend in the world of the game, this will satiate that hole in your stomach BL3 left you with. Note though that it'll only be a one-and-done ordeal. The endgame here is fairly non-existent and only the most desperate will be able to find fun in the replayability of this game.

But the thing that made me most happy... it's got heart.

Yes its still Borderlands under the hood slightly modified for the Tabletop RPG Feel

I liked the character creator and hope they keep the feature for the main series

I liked Tina previously but she started getting annoying (welcome to Tiny Temper Tantrum Tina's Wonderlands)

I like the IDEA of the overworld map, execution of it could have been better (too cartoony)

Main Story is all of 20 hours (this could have be 1 or 2 DLC in the main series)

Takes place between Borderlands 2 & 3

I like the random encounters - good way to get some XP and NOT have to go looking for loot boxes

Enemies don't vary much, neither are the things they say

THERE IS NO NEW GAME +   so if you want the max level of gun (currently 40) then SKIP ALL SIDE MISSIONS UNTIL MAIN QUEST DONE, Gun/Item rewards are your level

Game is a bit of a slog until you leave the main city

DLC seems to be a waste

I got this game on sale at for $50 and it feels like too much, $20-$30 would be a more worth it.

Couple Borderlands cameos

Feels there is more talking and less shooting because of the lore they build

It delivers exactly what is promised - a Borderlands game where the story is actually an RPG campaign, and the dungeon master is Tiny Tina the maniac.

The gunplay is fantastic as always. Tons of different crazy weapons that turn into Hydras and all kinds of crazy stuff that you can imagine, the loot is addictive and the skills are fun to learn.

My main issue with this game is the gameplay. 
-Guns feel very unimpactful and more just for chipping.
-Usually have to unload at least a magazine to kill an enemy.
-Guns are very uninteresting and not unique whatsoever, usually you find one decent weapon in 4 hours of gameplay.

Skills are where most of your damage comes from. However, as apposed to something interesting, most boil down to ""Click button to do more damage."" and you just save it until there's a boss or miniboss.

Aside from the damage feeling flat, the world being ripped out does no merit whatsoever for the game, not even from a ""oh it's like a board game!"" point of view. It just feels lazy and like i'm playing an arcade game rather than something with a thought out and grounded world. I have no sense of where anything is or why I am anywhere.

The loot dice you can find seem cool at first, but they are really just there to make you look around every barren crevice and corner to inflate play time so you can't refund it.

I really am at a loss as to how the reception to this was significantly better than BL3. This game is just not fun to play. It is a chore.

I've played all 4 Borderlands games and imo the franchise peaked at 2 and has been going downhill ever since. I gave this game a try thinking it'd be better because a lot of people like it but it isn't better to me, it's the same it just plays like a rogue like co-op rpg featuring Borderlands most annoyting character as the DM of a trashy fantasy world.

Not my thing. 

That said I know I can be a harsh judge so i may pick this back up to try again in the future and really this is a solid game. It runs very for me is very easy to understand and get into. If you have folks to play with and you like the setting it may be worth it for you. Art is subjective after all.

Gunplay has been enhanced by Spell (grenade) and Melee builds that feel great. Don't bother with the DLC on this one though, the main game is more than enough and the DLCs are pretty forced as loot grind.

However, the most recent update (as of writing) added chaos 100, which is their end game progression system. This is a change from chaos 50 which was already a large grind. Add to this the crazy level of RNG that comes with the tiered gear and you get one hell of a grind system; which some people love, but is far beyond most casual players. I don't want to leave the game on a negative note because it is amazing in every other way, [strike]but despite only finishing to chaos 51, I think I am finished the game for now unless some QoL changes get implemented.[/strike] EDIT: grinded to chaos 100, god rolled one of my gear pieces for my main build, safe to say my main character is a god now, all is well :)

It's a nice break away from the main series storyline, which I think majority of players would agree was suffering a bit. The dialogue is cute and funny and the voice actors all sound like they had a lot of fun with their characters.

Gameplay is a definite step up, offering even more classes to choose from, complete with fun explosive abilities to mix and match to your fancy. If you enjoy build crafting this is definitely for you. There are many quality of life additions as well, like the change of grenades to spells with cooldowns so I'm not constantly pressed to scour for ammo. The ability to fast travel anywhere without the need of a terminal and the removal of vehicles is a welcome change too, cutting out the time spent trudging through vast nothingness as you traverse from quest to quest.

The only part I did not enjoy was the overworld system which felt like an absolute chore to get through. All I wanted was to get to new exciting map locations and explore but instead I was forced to slow down, break my immersion and complete multiple mini side encounters, for upgrades; locked behind menial tasks, to make the entire thing slightly more bearable.

Voice acting is superb, story is nice, maps are d20 roll - grand with magnificent vistas, sounds are meaty, visual pollution is less than BL3.

However good guns are difficult to come by. Spells and abilities (apart for unique ones) are special gimmicks from previous games made standalone, melee is Krieg from BL2, but worse - since you CANT see your weapon outside inventory menu.

This turns levelling up into a punishment number that merely reminds you your clothing is now out of date and things are about to beat you down harder.

And I have to be honest here, I CANNOT recommend Tiny Tina's Wonderlands at all. I can't even recommend it when it's on sale. I found the writing to be just as bad, if not worse than Borderlands 3. Just about all of the dialogue was either generic or annoying. Sadly, the gunplay wasn't fun this time around. I understand that it's a fantasy game and that gives you freedom to make some pretty off the wall weapons. Unfortunately, I didn't really like how most weapons shot arrows. I just usually went for normal guns. Not to mention that the guns actually felt really weak in this game. It was a neat idea to give Melee weapons its own weapon slot, but it felt kinda meh to me. I enjoy Melee classes in the Borderlands series, and that hurts me to say that melee weapons and melee classes aren't fun in this game.
  Spells were fun enough as a replacement for grenades, but I never bothered to experiment too much on what each spell book could do. It was very painful to level up in this game. It felt like the enemies gave out too little experience for how much damage you had to do. It actually reminded me a lot about Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and how little experience you would get from that game. I heard, read, and watched a lot of negative reviews about the DLC. I didn't really bother on picking up DLC outside the Blight caller class.
  In my eyes, the Borderlands franchise started to go down hill in Tales from the Borderlands. The series fell even harder in Borderlands 3. And as for Wonderlands, I really don't like it. It felt more like Borderlands 3 and less Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep. The only parts I enjoyed about Tiny Tina's Wonderlands was Mr. Torgue, the totally not Smurfs side quest, quest items being available in vending machines after completing the side quest, and the ending of the game... when it ended.
  Look, I gave this game a real chance. I wanted to like it. I even made a second character to see if I would it enjoy it more than the Clawbringer+Brr-zerker combo. I tried Spore warden+ Blightcaller combo and it didn't make the game any more or any less enjoyable for me. This game is a disgrace to the Borderlands franchise as a whole. I don't care that it's a spin off game. I will NEVER buy any future installments to the Borderlands franchise.

Overall, the gameplay is of course very similar to the other games, but i find that the change from grenade mods to spells actually makes a big difference in how you play. The weapons feel pretty good as well, though perhaps slightly less fun than in Pre-Sequel. The classes are fun too, and the multi-classing (allowing you to pick a second class after a certain point in the campaign) allows for some nice build variety. The ability trees are smaller than in all the other versions (save BL1 I guess?) and the special class abilities aren't quite as awesome as in some of the other games (some of them are a bit bland in fact). But you eventually get to hot swap from 4 different class abilities, and you get 2 fairly strong passives, making things pretty good still. Also, you get to spend ability points à la DnD i.e. Constitution, Dexterity, Strength etc. which again allows for cool build diversity. Difficulty level is low to medium, with maybe one or two bosses that might catch you by surprise with a few cheap abilities, until you get the mechanics down (I played a more tanky character with high health, YMMV with low health builds I guess). It's the usual BL stuff really. A few annoyingly cheap moments, but overall it's fairly well balanced.

Visually, it's very nice. The various environments feel way more colorful and vibrant than in the other BL games. Levels are more varied in style, and for me, just more fun. The story was fine by me as well. I've always felt that the BL universe was nonsensical anyway. Playing the game under the pretence of being a DnD character and having Tina as the DM seems no more ridiculous (to me) than the other stories I've seen in BL so far. It's not a super long campaign, but there are quite a few side missions, and the end-game 'chaos-room' (basically a dungeon generator) adds more or less unlimited replay value if you really want to take things to the ultimate level with your character. Level cap is 40, but there is a secondary levelling system that opens up at that point (I can't speak to that, I haven't reached that level yet). 

I'd like to add a note regarding the absolutely awesome voice work from Ashly Burch in her role of Tina. You get to hear a lot from Tina of course, and Ashly is just amazing in how she delivers her lines. Yeah, it's a bit cringe sometimes, but it does work given the context. Will Arnett is very good as well, as are all the other voice actors.

I got the game on sale with a bunch of DLCs, and I've put in about 60 hours or so now I think, and completed the main quest along with 75% of the side quests on one character. I'm glad I picked it up. It's good satisfying action as you'd expect from a BL title, with a few twists to make things a bit different compared to the other versions.",1680752619,1680752619,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly, the user interface is terrible. It was bad throughout the whole Borderlands series, and they somehow managed to make it even worse. Another gripe I have with the game is its difficulty, it's too easy for me even on 'intense' difficulty, and I'm not even good at FPS games.

Despite those two negatives, this game is mostly fun, and I'm having a blast playing it. The Borderlands-esque silliness works better in this setting, as it's already a parody.

Most of my issues with the game come from the writing, main story especially. Where characters feel like caricatures, either flanderised or just one-note. The main story itself doesn't go too far either, opting to stay completely safe to the entire franchise rather than do anything actually interesting. Tina isn't really Tina anymore, but the safe and wacky version of Tina with little to no issues aside from maybe a few quests.

For main story conflict, there is little to none (aside from a few main issues that get resolved almost instantly) and the universe itself doesn't actually make sense. Things happen in-game independent of the DM and characters outside of the game, which then affect the outside world, rather than the other way around. 
Also, Tina is still 12/13 in this game and will occasionally make inappropriate jokes. There were maybe 3 or 4, but, those times were just uncomfortable and definitely not as tasteful as the game seems to play them off as. 

The humour in this entry feels like it changed a lot, which makes sense considering the best head writer in the series hasn't been here since Borderlands 2. So we're stuck with reddit-tier or below-reddit tier jokes. Find them funny if you wish, but it is incredibly low effort in terms of writing. With the slap in the face being how safe it plays every single joke, considering one of the main draws of Borderlands used to be how messed up the world was while being so lighthearted. This is just light-hearted without the reality to it.

However, and the biggest however possible -- if you can get past the writing or just mute while playing, the actual gunplay itself and how classes work feels phenomenal. As of Chapter 4, you unlock multiclassing which opens you up to just over 20 combinations of classes that can let you play the game whichever way you wish. My only criticism with multiclassing is the fact that the game doesn't give you your secondary class sheet upon choosing, and, you can only switch second classes at the end of the game. 

But that is the reason I played through this game so many times (and will likely play through more in the future), because of how effective the skills, spells, guns and classes work in tandem with each other. I was quite surprised, since, I really thought I wouldn't like this game from the story alone. I'm glad I stuck through it.

Another side note, for people who do care about postgame, the most fun you'll be having is save editing on your own or messing around with the game of your own accord. Since, the only post-game is the Chaos Chamber, and you have to save edit for anything close to the replayability of the TVHM seen in other previous games. The modding ""community"" isn't as strong as BL3 and especially not BL2, though I can't remove points on this game for it I feel the need to point it out for anyone looking to mod the game like BL3/BL2.

Get it on sale for sure (considering the price, and the lack of content compared to similar priced games of the series), and avoid the short cashgrab DLC's -- unless you're just getting Shattering Spectreglass for the Blightcaller class, because that was the only highlight of the entire extra amount of money I spent on said DLC. I'm sure you can look through the DLCs for yourself to realise why people don't like them, but all they really do is add more chaos chamber content at the end of the day and not a whole lot of it.
And if you don't like the writing, take a speedrun tip and exit to main menu whenever a character talks for too long. Works most of the time for skipping dialogue.",1679162329,1680391509,True,95,3,0.820135951042175293,0,True,False,False

I'm a big fan of BL2, I was in my 20s when BL2 came out so the humor hit me just right back then whereas the jokes in this game were hit and miss. I do love the comedians in this game, aka, Wanda Sykes, Will Arnett, and Andy Samburg. I did think the Smurfs and Witcher parody quests were standouts for me. 

I loved BL2, and Tiny Tina was a favorite character of mine. Unfortunately, they do a disservice to her in this game... even moreso than BL3 did. At some point, Tina whimpers to her playmates, ""I don't wanna be left all alone..."" and I think that was a mistake, showing her vulnerability like that. What made Tiny Tina so interesting, is that she was a little kid in the brutal borderlands setting and she did NOT show any vulnerability, as you'd expect any kid who lost their parents and were all alone to be crying and needy towards folks. Not Tina, she was quite independent, blew up the bandit that killed her fam and then had a tea party with some imaginary friends. Interesting! Different! By making Tina cry about being all alone, asking these new characters if they'll ""stay and play"" with her, they took away what made Tiny Tina unique and made her just like every other kid. In BL2, for example, they didn't have to spell out, ""Tina & Roland were close,"" they just show their picture together in Tina's bunker, and when she's playing Dragon Keep, she is waiting for Roland to appear ready to play even though he's been *spoiler for BL2* killed.

And if you're like me - you don't care about endgame, only the journey to it. For that, Wonderlands is excellent. A step-up in narrative from BL3, a visual feast, and the fun combat from BL3. 
+ Dragon Lord is no Handsome Jack, but still 2nd best villain in the franchise after him
+ The support characters are fun and have great chemistry (unlike Ava). There are also 5 return characters from mainline Borderldands, and none of them I felt were bastardized.
+ [b]SPELLS[/b] replacing grenades is, IMO, the best thing to happen to grenades in franchise. I never played classes that focused on them and would have good bonuses to damage and recovery, and so to me they were always just an afterthought, but Spells are just so much more fun and varied, and you don't have to conserve them, since they are just on cooldown. Finished the game as Spellshot with class ability replaced by 2nd Spell.
+ By the end of the game I realized that I don't actually miss vehicles. Overworld with bobblehead characters replaced that part of traversal, and it contributes to the game's great pacing. The vehicles themselves were always cool, but the encounters focused on them weren't ever worthwhile. A simple yet effective and pretty overworld is a great replacement, even if it wouldn't make sense in mainline.
+ Another big contributor to the game's great pacing is quest design. Short, meaningless ones are like this - you find quest giver on Overworld, listen to their 1-minute long exposition, move like 10 meters to arena-like encounter, finish 2 stages, collect quest item and go back to quest giver for reward. Longer, well written ones typically have their own section on big maps, and a few are even the main reason to be on that map, because a bunch of them you'll never visit for main quest chain, and yet they are all absolutely worth exploring just for sights alone. As a result, maps never feel cluttered by side quests and almost never have backtracking issues. Small encounters you accept and complete almost on the spot and bigger ones that are worth your time are not lost in cluttered questlog.

If I had to nitpick my experience on the journey to the endgame, there are 2 minor issues:
- The game insists on cluttering your inventory with melee weapons for loot, but melee system is not reworked to make melee focused builds worthwhile. No block, no dodge, no heavy attacks, no variety in how different melee weapons behave, besides swing speed and stats. It's mostly the same as any other BL game, and the melee loot is just a waste of RNG rolls. Even if melee builds were some of the most powerful in game, with this gameplay I cannot take them seriously, after being spoiled by games like Vermintide and Dying Light.
- The balancing is definitely off. After I reached level 24 and got capstone skill on my Spellshot the game just lost all challenge. I just dumped all my points in crit chance, took the SMG spewing the highest amount of projectiles/second, the biggest baddest 2 spells, and just cruised through 2nd half of the game. I still had fun, courtesy of writing, art direction and spell variety, but the only times I died were environmental hazards, not enemies TRYING to kill me.

The ""bazillion guns"" that drop make it arbitrary if you really want to waste your time comparing stats when you will find one that is ever so slightly better just around the corner. I stopped caring altogether and just sold everything without ever looking at them. Ever so often I would take new one after leveling up a few levels but it was not really enganging wich brings me to my second problem. The enemies are just as arbitrary. The vast majority of enemies don't require you to tackle them differently. Basically all of them can be killed by spamming them with bullets and your special skills. Those could be interesting but they aren't because you just don't have any reason to refine them. 

And the skill tree is a smoke screen. They split them in multiple parts and sell them as extra classes which might feel like more but if you compare it with BL2 they just split them up and made them smaller and in direct comparison not remotely as interesting. Minor stats changes don't affect your playstyle and major new abilities are very rare and disappointing me more often than not.

What made BL2 click for me just is not present here and it is really hard to pin down. Lots of quality of life stuff is missing, odd decisions like the names of your friends being just that bit too large on screen are annoying. The total overload of effects make strategic play absolutely impossible (not that you would need to) and the story is okay. The voice actors do a good job and the writing is okay but a far cry from being memorable like BL2. The tons ob side missions do almost nothing for the main story and you forget what it's all about constantly. The many cameos of characters from the other games are undercooked and feel like lame fan service.

All in all, the sum of its parts leave me mostly indifferent. I stopped interacting with most of the systems like skill tree, weapon selection, listening to the story since none of it matters much since the core gameplay loop is just so plain. 

So, If I could, I would give it a neutral ""meh"" instead of the thumbs down. It is just not interesting enough for a recommendation and just not bad enough for a ""stay away"" warning. It is okay if you really do not have anything else which should be impossible these days.",1680207046,1680207046,False,6,0,0.56333458423614502,0,True,False,False

Best combat so far in the game, great new concept with characters making it more fun to play and make your own builds. Interesting abilities and replacing grenades with spells is just the best feature to have.

The only downside is the replayability as there's no True vault hunter mode. Yes there is something (Chaos rounds) but they get old after a while. I've not tried the DLC's so can't comment on them but from what I've heard they aren't worth it either.

It helps with the humour if you've played D&D type games including playing with miniatures, and turning spilled soda pop into rivers and lakes, and Cheetos into road blocks is priceless. And of course the 20 sided dice are present. 
If you have not played D&D with a group of other players the game will still be worth playing. You just might not get all of the humour. There are also the usual references to pop media, inducing quite a few which may make older players laugh, such as references to Beetles songs, and there are references to much more recent songs to. All in all, this crew of developers knows how to put together a game that is both fun, and funny. I can recommend it for the humour alone. But in addition to that, it runs pretty well, even on my ancient machine. If your machine meets the minimum requirements, then you shouldn't have problems.
Get it for the fun. Play it for the adventure! It's nuts to be whaling away at a monster with a sword one moment, and a sub machine gun the next. It's beautifully incongruous, just as Tiny Tina's mind (or the mind of any somewhat wild and unconventional little girl that age) would cook up.

This is fantasy mixed with Borderlands. I personally enjoyed the main story line and the side quests were entertaining and enjoyable. The fantasy setting is engaging, the monsters are awesome, and the Overworld setting mixes well with the actual game. I beat the game in a good 20 hours and it was a blast!

There are a few shortcomings with Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. The main one being the lack of legendary loot. I play these games for the thrill of seeing a legendary item drop and having the icon pop up on the map. In my 20 hours of beating the game, only TWO legendary items dropped before the final fight. I received two more from quests but still, only TWO legendary items dropping in 20 hours of game play is unacceptable. You can argue that this makes greens/blues/purples more balanced but I don't like having to sift through hundreds of weapons to find the right one. When I saw the trailer for this game and the dice rolls I thought they had so much potential to drop good loot but they feel so underwhelming. The loot is easily the biggest problem with the game but everything else is amazing. 

Another shortcoming is the credits. Why are there 20+ minutes of FORCED credits? I'm all for appreciating the developers for the game but when I'm having to sit there for 20-30 minutes and I can't get out that feels real bad. Other reviews mentioned LBGQT being forced down their throats during the game but I didn't notice it (probably because I didn't play with sound for most of it). There's some characters here and there that are LBGQT but overall it doesn't feel pushy. 

In conclusion, this game was a lot of fun for what it is - a Borderlands game mixed in a fantasy world. The story and side quests are at their best but the loot feeling so underwhelming is a clear issue. Also, the credits... WHY

-1.5 for lackluster loot

 The side quests are honestly mostly pretty good, they're goofy and usually have pretty cool rewards, all of the games main and side quests can be completed in around 35 - 40 hours which is a massive downgrade from any other borderlands game.

 Do not buy this game for 60 dollars, its just not 60 bucks worth of content for most people. chaos trials are a decent way to farm some cool loot, but make for a boring endgame as that's the only endgame gearbox gave us with this one.

the game-play is amazing, same as borderlands 3 but a bit goofier with all the fantasy based elements, the guns feel great, the movement feels great, the spells feel great and way better than grenades ever have in a borderlands game. its a very very fun game because gearbox has gotten great at making interesting weapons and build opportunities, its just a shame the endgame is so lackluster because this game had so much potential.

The dlc are a joke. each one gives you 1 new (not good) boss fight and some new loot. the loots cool but borderlands 3 did this for free with seasonal events, the dlc should have been seasonal events. The dlc are a pathetic money grab and gearbox should be ashamed of doing their fans dirty with dlc again.

If they get better, I don't want to invest the time necessary to ""level around and find out"" if I am wrong.

I liked Borderlands 1, I thought Borderlands 2 was cool, but I never cared for the Pre-Sequel and I never even bothered with Borderlands 3. I personally did not like this game. My friends made it cool to play, because the writing is so cringe and terrible that we could just make fun of it and the characters which got me past the parts where someone is talking. But what you'll quickly realize is that everyone is always talking. Your character you created never stops talking, the npcs talk forever, and the quality of the jokes is not clever and or well executed. The game play is not very explanatory on what stats you'll actually need to be successful in a class when joining mid game on someone else's progress, which lead to me making a very poor character at first. So I started over, with some understanding of the mechanics a little better, which lead to a better character build, but now i'm playing solo and I feel like I am dying inside playing this game. The only fun part of this game is the combat because of how smooth it is, but let's be real, despite all of the options, it just boils down to shooting and casting a spell or doing your action skill in between. It's cool, it's fine, but it gets old fast. Your tolerance of terrible dialogue, excessive chatter, and loot to take forever looking at wondering if it's worth using maybe higher than mine.

Sexual and gender identity video games are also not my cup of tea.
The spell mechanics of the spell slinger class, can't be arsed to remember the name, has its charm but the RNG loot system makes it difficult to gear up with the right spells to make my build work and when I get spell combos I do like, I quickly out level their usefulness and have to wait for the RNG dance to make it fun again.
There's some potential with the mechanics of this game and there's some charm to the environment, but not for a CIS gendered individual who likes the RP in an RPG and the guns of BL2.
Honestly, if Gearbox would just make a game that wasn't trying to be woke, or politically correct, took the loot system of BL3, the class system of this game and the Guns from BL2, and just went with a bland generic story, or even resurrect Jack and have us kick Hyperion's, or even a new indsutry's, ass across several galaxies and multiple planets, it would be amazing.

That's a huge disappointment after Borderlands 3. Besides better graphics everything is much worse.
Shooting feels poor, no satisfaction from killing these creatures - they could rly add some dismemberment of skeletons upon crit kills, not a big deal.
The world is ""plastic"" and torn apart - to be honest, it wasn't supposed to be whole, but Tina's and the team's comments didn't make any success in creating any sort of ""world"" in this kinda DnD fantasy.
3 hours is enough for a story to catch you at least a bit - it couldn't here. Flat childish humor, non-organic, forced and unnecessary non-binary shit - everything makes you getting bored as fast as possible.

I even think that it's not gearbox software making that but some bunch of students used great developers team to make their dreams come true.

In short: if you were looking for to extend you borderlands experience - it's not here, keep looking.

And a good lesson - if the rating of game in steam is ""mostly positive"" - it's complete garbage. Shame i played one more hour than it needed to make a refund. At least there was borderlands 3 in the pack.",1679402297,1679402297,False,3,1,0.383725553750991821,0,True,False,False

It's a little buggy though. The Lost Loot feature doesn't work at all, which is probably the most disappointing bug. They're releasing updates and patches, but sometimes they do more harm than good. And I'm a little disappointed that the level cap is 40. With multi-classing available, I'd like to be able to explore more with skill points, but with only 40 skill points, your choices are to dabble in both classes a little, and never get to the really good skills, or master one class and barely scratch the surface of your second class. But they've released DLC with increased level caps before, so I remain hopeful.

It's been a minute since I played Borderlands and Borderlands 2 and I'm not tabletop DnD player so I came into this with a limited expectations and a vague idea of what it was all about, and I can not say that I'm disappointed!
The play style is familiar and comfortable and its easy to get back into the Borderlands groove again. The artwork is nostalgic to my early days as a gamer though the color pallet is far more vibrant and spashy. The story narrative is absolutely hilarious! It's creative and well delivered and full of twists that will blind-side you and keep you on your toes. The professional comedic voice acting is a cherry on top. It's not any reason to purchase the game but it sure doesn't hurt it. There are choices (and consequences) to your actions and whether you take that short cut to an objective or put in the effort and see a part of the story that would otherwise be left untold.
Is it another 2K Borderlands game? Yes, but lets look at the roots of this one. It was a BL2 DLC that 2K decided was worth its own game. And they delivered! They took the Borderlands model (that works and has been successful) and re-skinned it. Then they added magic and fantasy and kept the guns. They gave it a paint job. And then they gave it full serving of comedy. They put all of that into a tabletop game and threw it into a box and called it Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and I'm not sorry to spend the $50 on it and it's 4 DLC on sale. Even at only 4 hours in at the time of this review, this has already become my new favorite game, and based on my previous Borderlands experience, I'll be playing this one for a very long time.

In short, is it worth the price tag? For me, yeah. I was happy to dish out the $50 CDN on this one for the full game and the 4 DLC.

[EDIT:] Now 80 Hours in and going for 100% completion. Can't say I'm bored yet, and I haven't even begun looking at the replayability of it with all of the viable class combinations.

I played this co-op and the combat was largely the same as prior entries just in a different setting. I think personally the Borderlands series is starting to lose its charm. The dialogue felt grating but in line with Borderlands 3. The side quests dragged on and had a ton of dialogue that served little purpose other than to waste time and tell bad jokes. You might expect combat to be different since this is a fantasy world but you still use guns - although there are a few new variants. The biggest deviation is using spells instead of grenades. The spells in the game do have some various new effects and visuals that were fun to use. 

I did have some good mindless fun playing this co-op but I think Gearbox needs to reevaluate it's formula - but maybe I'm just aging out of the target demographic.

As always the art style is timeless and will always age like a fine wine. One of the most gorgeous borderlands yet, the colors are less faded than previous games, the lighting got a upgrade, the vistas look wonderful, and the stylistic choices of textures and U.I. all blend really well. The actual story is a nice surprise too, after the atrocious borderlands 3 I was concerned how awful this games writing would be but its actually pretty good and even got a few chuckles out of me. And the new big bad could obviously never fill the shoes of Handsome Jack but he does give similar vibes and is a huge step up from BL3 twins.

Even the worst game in the series (Pre sequel btw) was very fun. The main question for me will be - Is this game better than Borderlands 3? I think BL3 is the best game in the series, but if this one will be as big as BL3, it can easily move BL3 on second place.
Oh and one more thing that is SUPER ANNOYING - when you run, your character starts panting, and he doing it VERY loud. Kinda hate it to be honest... It is super noticable and goes over ANY sound in the game...",1679163357,1679164237,True,2,0,0.498004168272018433,0,True,False,False

Edit : Finished the game, figured out what happened.   During the first part of the game I was seriously having to grind through everything - every monster seemed to take 2 reloads just to finish off.  
At some point after that first third, either by grinding +loot% dice or the +loot% gear I was wearing, the gear caught up to the game and it stopped being as much of a slog.  
  
Switching the review to Yes - I recommend it to other players.  Not highly recommended though - the game was pretty repetitive and the combat was lacking in anything special about it.    The voice acting and the dialogue was stellar however.

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands substitutes grinding and repetitive combat for story and content. This isn't even funny, like a Tiny Tina quest, the writing is just bollocks.

It was OK, I was getting through it, enduring it for a higher purpose... to get into the second playthrough and get the skill perks all unlocked, and keep getting better gear like the Borderlands formula has always been.

I finished the game, did most of the side quests, did the DLC encounters all twice to get ""lost souls"" to spin the Wheel of Fate to get gear, but the gear was always repetitions of the same things so I gave that up.

Time to start the second playthrough. Wait a minute, how do I do that, I don't see it in the Character choosing interface.

There isn't one! The game is essentially over at level 40 and there's no more gameplay for that character unless you just want to repeat tedious encounters. There is no incentive for me to want to start this game over with a new character, it's just not that much fun.

Battery Life.  Apx. 1 Hr on Standard Settings
Story:  Short; 24 Hours 
Replayability:  High
Improvements:  Better than Borderlands 3 in both story content & replayability.  Introducing Chaos Levels allows the difficulty and quality of look to be increased exponentially.  This includes a weekly featured run, and chaos runs to fit your appetite.  This function also applies to zones outside of the Chaos Room which felt great when catching up on side content.  
Bugs:  Enemies get stuck from time to time.  Nothing else that impacts experience.  
DLC:  Could be better.  Added a few ""Challenge"" levels with a specific theme.  Not any major story content.
Verdict:  8/10;  Runs better on deck than expected without any real crashes or major issues.  If you are playing on battery life keep in mind you will get about 1 hour's worth of time with this game.

I know exactly why they did it- to recreate the feel of D&D encounter maps- but this gets repetative fast, the 'arenas' that most of the fights take place in are small and unimaginative and have little to no distinctive qualities. The 'Overworld' map is an poor replacement for the true open nature of the aforementioned Borderlands games and gets old real fast. The 'random encounters' do nothing to further the game other than pad out the short runtime. Even the loot in this one feels forced, there's too much of it and not enough things to make it stand out.

Been a fan of the series since the first Borderlands game. TTW gives me mixed feelings. Don't get me wrong. The game is good and felt like the rest of the series. Love the lore and new elements tailored for TTW. 

SPELLS & GUNS:
I find myself spending more time mix and match with the spells than guns. The guns are fun and top notch just like any other Borderlands guns. However the spells are the cream and butter of the game. Each time I obtained a new spell, I would spend time to develop new builds to make use of them. Although later in the end game, I find myself sticking to only few of the spells... Wish there is more variety and fun to use spell. 

CLASSES:
The dual class is fun! Only that I have so many skill point to spend. 

LORE and Characters:
Mix feeling about the lore and characters come back. I wish to see more old faces in the game. It's a pity only a handful of the series characters joined the game. If only the later DLC could have them in the content. Dragon Lord is my 2nd fav antagonist of the series. Not gonna spoil, but he is funny and yet serve the purpose of carrying throughout the entire journey. 

END GAME:
The CHaos Chamber is actually quite fun. I didn't expect myself to spend so much time in it. It has became one of my daily activities. It's like the whole campaign is just a prologue to finally unlocking this mode. 

DLC:
Meh...... 

TTW isn't perfect and may or may not live up to your expectation, but hey, if you like Borderlands and especially the Dragonbane Keep, TTW is a game that you shouldn't miss.",1678028197,1678028197,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also theres Torgue, guy is an exploding laugh...riot... thats on fire... he is friggin hilarious, if i had known he was in id have bought it just for that.

Update after several playthroughs on pc and ps, eventhough i didnt mind the replays as much due to the class diversity i do wish there was a new game+ mode, the current endgame is not my cup of tea, for me it gets too repetitive.

It ALSO does NOT cost 30. Max ~20

The UI/UX is completely atrocious, half of the time you have no idea where the enemy is, can't separate friend from foe. The loot in Loot&Shooter game is almost non existent. 
The characters are also boring/unpleasant most of the time.
The best experience is the whole chapter with Mr. Torgue (because reasons) and next chapter with Skeletons. 
The main villain is kinda cool, and so is the final fight(which is basically 2 WoW raids in 1 ), but the ending was kinda meh.

Annoying. Writing is terrible and annoying. Encounters are SO tedious and you have to seek out the enemies to hit the progress bar to go to the same ""round 1 -> round 2 -> pillar boys -> loot"" loop. ResidentSleeper

// OLD REVIEW BELOW:
//

I can see why this game got worse reviews than the other Borderlands games. However, I’m still really enjoying it:

The good:
+Movement feels the best out of any Borderlands game I’ve played
+Loot pool is vast, weapon models and animations are top tier, alternative fire modes are far more creative than BL2 for example
+When you level up, you get a skill point AND a hero point (classic STR/DEX/CON etc.)
+Loot dice and marbles incentivize exploring and you develop a sense of “I should check over here for dice/marble”. Finding dice drops loot and gives a buff for finding better items that persists for the rest of the game. Finding all of the marbles grants a permanent buff to STR and dmg(?)
+Lots of new enemies with a familiar flavor to the Borderlands franchise. One of my favorites is the shark dog lol

The bad:
-The way your character acts is like the rest of the dialogue and writing: annoying, rude, childish
-The encounter system is new and fun the first few times… and then you notice the same couple of maps over and over
-You are able to poke around and explore a lot of these giant maps. Then later, you get a quest for… those areas you already explored… so there you are again but this time with quest objectives / a purpose 

The ugly:
-The writing and dialogue is awful. It is so annoying. Their audience clearly isn’t the now older generation that played Borderlands 1/2. It’s like it was written by teenagers for teenagers.
-The game takes place as a visualization of playing Dungeons and Dragons. The world and your impact on it feels trivial / pointless because this all takes place in a game of DnD rather than saving the world/town/etc. 


Overall, I’d give this game a solid 7/10",1669339343,1677401291,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

•	Its Borderlands with a fantasy theme, so if you’ve played any Borderlands shooter, the combat will feel familiar.

•	Fight against skeletons, goblins, giant crabs, shark dogs and nagas. Borderlands has always featured strange creatures, so the fantasy theme basically just means “no robots”.

•	There are a few character classes to choose from. I started with Clawbringer, who reminded me of Marvel’s Thor because they can throw a massive hammer to deal lightning (or fire) damage to all enemies in a large area. I also had a pet wyvern who flies around breathing fire at enemies. Part way through the game you can multiclass, and I chose Spore Warden to get a pet mushroom who runs around biting enemies. Those pets are surprisingly useful and got quite a few kills as well as just generally distracting enemies.

•	As usual you can equip a variety of pistols, SMGs, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, and rocket launchers, which all have different magazine sizes, zoom sights, elemental damage, etc. You can also use spells, which are just fantasy themed grenades, and melee weapons.

•	The best part of the game is the unique gun designs, which are a lot of fun to use. There were so many times that I decided “this is my new favourite gun”, only to find something else that was even better a short time later.  A few of my favourites include an SMG which freezes enemies, a sniper rifle that shoots triple saw blades, a crossbow that fires crossbows (which fire extra bolts), an SMG which fires a poison damage laser beam that slightly homes in on nearby enemies, and a rapid fire pistol which halved my health when reloading but leeched health back when damaging enemies.

•	The hard / “intense” difficulty started out fairly challenging, but over time became easier as I found more powerful guns.

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	Both the main story and all the side quests are absolute nonsense. Dialogue is terrible. Every character is annoying. Because Tina is the DM, everything sounds like it was written by her. In previous Borderlands games, when Tina shows up for a couple of quests, her chaotic energy can be an interesting change of pace. But it turns out that a whole game that sounds like Tina is just exhausting. After a few hours I lost interest and stopped listening as much as possible.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	It took me 29 hours to complete the main story and most of the side quests.

•	I didn’t have any problems with bugs, crashes or framerate.

•	Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

Also the game pauses, freezes and hangs up a lot. Sometimes you'll weapon switch and the game will freeze for a while.
Besides those two issues, the game itself is just not Borderlands quality. It's boring. It's more of a children's game. It struggles really desperately to be clever but it's like they hired a team of woke 12 year olds to write the story and the dialogue.
Examples:
The bar you are told to go to makes a point in emphatically emphasizing more than once that all the drinks are non-alcoholic. Besides that there's no reason for you to go there or for it to exist in the game. RIP Moxi I guess. (Anytime you run into anyone drinking anything the game goes out of it's way to assure you it's just a soda. It's weird.)

One of the skills on your skill tree is to give your companion the ability to fart.

I only remember there being one straight character in the game and he is in love with a broom, because it has straight blond hair. Get it? He thinks the straw is hair.

Your way is blocked so you must find the pure essence of snot to clear the way.

You do a quest for an archer who is looking for a legendary bow. When you find it, it's actually a bow-tie. Get it? BOW...... tie. Get it?

And those are the knee slappers.
The only time I laughed was when the little angry feminist npc called my female character a misogynist out of the blue. 
Buy it if you think those gags are clever and hilarious or if it's on an incredible sale and there's nothing else to play.

The negative features are the noticeable pushing of Woke content that is in the game, by this I mean how the characters tend to have alot of dialog and quests about their sexuality of the characters.

I have nothing against this but it seems it's a recurring theme and thus is worth of mentioning, it became a bit much when the pirates in the game scream out every five seconds ''yarr there he she'' it or  they blows'' or something similar.

Or those who give you the quests must have a questline that takes up a large part of the game where they constantly push this subject in your face - That is a negative thing for me who want to escape from day to day politics when i play videogames.

I personally have nothing against this, but I thought it was sad to see that the game I logged in to escape reality and politics led to more of this, this drags the game down a lot as there is a lot of unnecessary dialogue in that regard, that is wasted on other content that could be much more fun.

Virtue Signalling

An interesting spin-off of the Borderlands games that brings some new stuff, but is also unfortunately hindered by other aspects.

Based on Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep (originally a BL2 DLC but later released as a standalone), Wonderlands is a new tale being told by Tiny Tina during a game of Bunkers & Badasses, with a new group this time, and the player's character is a newbie in the group.

This time, instead of playing as pre-set characters as in previous Borderlands games, for the first time, the player is able to create their own character, not only choosing how they look and sound but also assigning attribute points as well. While I think the way attributes affect the character feels a little too simple in this game and could have been expanded on, I think this is a good starting point if future Borderlands games (or at least future Wonderlands games) use this concept - which I think they should.

As for designing the character in terms of visuals... While I like the idea, I'm not a fan of the execution. It kinda feels like no matter how much you change your character, they never look satisfying, there is always something off about how they look.

Gameplay-wise, there aren't a lot of complaints - it's basically how other Borderlands games work with a few changes, mostly on how grenades are replaced with spells and how the game now has actual melee combat. While melee combat is very simple and it's really only about holding the middle mouse button to attack, it's still a step in the right direction for future games and far better than other games where it was only guns granting melee damage bonuses and with enemies' melee attacks causing constant knockback. Spells are also a cool addition to the game, working on cooldown (varying with each spell) rather than based on amount and with different effects that go beyond just causing damage, as some spells are more focused on utility. Guns are still mostly guns, with some crossbows and other ranged weapons added to it, but the gunplay is still the same for the most part.

The story is... Okay. I don't hate it, but I don't love it either and I think it's definitely a step back from Assault on Dragon Keep, which was a lot more interesting. The story has its moments, but the villain feels severely underused - it's only later in the game when the villain finally makes an appearance and gives the player's character an actual reason to want to defeat them, before that it's only some lines of dialogue from him and Tina telling the player's character that he's the big bad guy. And after that, the only moment when the villain becomes relevant again besides the occasional dialogue is right close to the end.

Like Borderlands 3 before, Wonderlands has challenges to be completed in each map which involve finding certain things. This is mostly fun and encourages exploration, but the problem is how the game deals with the Loot Die. Basically, without finding these, the chances for higher rarity drops in the game is very low, so finding these die becomes sort of mandatory if the player wants to have a decent chance at acquiring better loot. Fortunately, it only has to be done once, as it carries over to other characters.

The game also removes the ability to farm bosses for drops, as bosses no longer respawn after they're defeated, which is a very weird design choice for a Borderlands spin-off game.

Classes are fun to play as - while the skill selection for each class feels slightly limited, the ability to multi-class later in the game allows for different skills from two different classes to be mixed together, which then allow for some interesting builds.

I also specially like how Myth Ranks work in the game, where points spent are cycled through 4 different groups of stats instead of offering random selections - even though each point has to be spent on each of these different groups, you can choose in which stat inside that group that point goes to, so it's possible to focus and max out certain stats to the player's preferences.

The way the game deals with end-game content is interesting, but extremely repetitive, with the inclusion of Chaos Chambers, a sort of roguelike mode where the player goes into these chambers, getting progressively harder while also unlocking bonuses for the player's character, then rewarding them with loot at the end. It's the main way the game has of acquiring legendaries and it's fun at first, but with a total of 50 chaos levels to progress through, it gets very repetitive very fast.

Overall, Wonderlands does some things right and some things wrong, tries a few new things, some of these work and some don't. There is room for improvement in future games and I hope that some of the new things included in Wonderlands carry over to future games, while others should be improved on.

Your weapons have very little impact on mobs but when they hit you they send you flying, bump you or cause your screen to flash/shake. 

The game also constantly scales as you level but gives you VERY crappy loot making you feel constantly under powered.

The Borderlands games were an absolute favorite of mine for the first and second games, but by the time The Pre-Sequel and 3 came out (I forget which order they were released in, I want to say Pre-Sequel was released first) I had pretty much lost interest in the franchise and really FPS games entirely, but when I saw Tiny Tina's my inner RPG addict tag teamed with my nostalgia and convinced me to buy the game after I had beaten Elden Ring for the nth time and was in desperate search of something new. 

[hr][/hr]

[h1][u][b]The Pros[/b][/u][/h1]

○ [u]Classic Borderlands[/u] 
And I do mean classic. It felt like playing the original game again. No grand universe-scope plot. Just you as some random nobody going around and beating up on crap until it spits out loot and gold...so much gold!

○ [u]The Comedic Value[/u] 
This was one of the many things I loved about the original game. Is the humor brash and juvenile? Absolutely. But it's part of what makes the game so unique. I love it.

○ [u]What RPG elements were in the game, were solid[/u] 
I liked the class mechanics (I've only done Gloombringer (Graveborn/Clawbringer) so far, but I fully intend to give the other classes a test run). The action skills were cool, I really dug the talent trees and the way the different class combos could play off of each other.

○ [u]The utter disregard for the Fourth Wall[/u] 
Okay. So, I'm a writer. This is one of my favorite literary devices of all time. That direct split where the fourth wall comes down and the characters in the story are [b]fully[/b] aware that they're fictional characters is just...yes. I loved it.

○ [u]Tina, Valentine, and Fette[/u] 
The dynamic between these three was just fantastic. They really brought the game together, and Andy Samburg's performance as Valentine was A plus.

○ [u]Claptrap[/u]
Seeing this little guy pop up at various points was a really nice dose of nostalgia. I don't really have much else to say than that without risking spoiling anything, but thank you Gearbox for bringing him into the fold for this one.

○ [u]The Story[/u]
Once again, Gearbox managed to do what so few FPS games have been able to manage in the past. We got a compelling narrative alongside great gunplay. I was invested in the story, I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I even went as far as loading an outdated cloud save when my computer decided to seize up right before a cutscene.

○ [u]The Atmosphere[/u]
I have to admit, this impressed me [i]a lot[/i]. Gearbox managed to encapsulate what it's like to sit at a TTRPG session with an absolute loon of a DM (love you Tina, but you're off your rocker and that's what I love most about you). The bickering between Valentine and Fette, as well as two of them regularly poking holes in Tina's prepared content that resulted in her having to improvise like hell. It was great. It brought back some fond memories from a campaign I ran years ago.

[hr][/hr]

[h1][u][b]The Cons[/b][/u][/h1]

○ [u]I felt a little...misled[/u] 
This is probably my own fault because truth be told, I knew [i]nothing[/i] about this game aside from the vague explanation of ""It's Borderlands meets D&D."" I went into it expecting more RPG elements than it had, something with more focus on sword and board and less guns. But, again. I think I did that one to myself. 

○ [u]The guns[/u] 
So, as we all know from our time spent playing Borderlands (and if you don't know, then now you will), one of the big themes in all the games was the whole ""every gun manufacturer has their own gimmick"" deal. I feel like I get what Gearbox was trying to do here, that is to blend magic into modern/futuristic firearms, but in my opinion it just fell short. 

In the 40 hours or so it took me to work my way to the end of the game whilst being distracted by side quests, I found myself almost always holding onto a Blackpowder weapon that was a huge item level gap behind other options because there wasn't some gimmick to it. It was just a gun.

○ [u]The Character Customization[/u]

Okay, I want to preface this with one very important thing. To my knowledge, Gearbox has never given us any sort of customization options besides color (I think that was a thing, that might not even have been) in any of the previous games, so I applaud them for finally doing so. 

That being said, I found the whole system utterly clunky and annoying. The initial character creation had so few options, I finally ended up just randomizing things because even with the slider overdrive on there just was not enough diversity of options to really compel me to sit there on character creation for hours on end like I've done with many RPG titles in the past.

○ [u]The Overworld[/u]

I felt like I needed a map to read what was essentially the world map. The Overworld, to me, felt like an unnecessary mini game and a pretty perfunctory attempt at giving that open world feel to a game franchise that has traditionally been pretty linear. The shrine piece collecting was tiresome considering the limited reward for finishing each of them, and the side quests were almost without exception nothing more than the same fetch quest with different flavor text.

○[u]The Spells[/u]

The only reason I found myself actually using spells was because of the Graveborn talent that granted HP regen on spell use and Morhaim's Blessing which gave you all of those wonderful kill skills every time you activated a spell. They were a utility item for me, half the time I didn't even bother to aim them I just tapped the button to gain the bonuses it would bring. I feel like more could have been done here.

○ [u]Performance Issues[/u]

Specs for the PC I played on
◘ Intel i5 9400F 2.90GHz
◘ 8GB DDR4 RAM
◘ NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER
◘ Game data stored on HDD (not 100% sure on speed, but I think 7200)

For starters, I want to state clearly that I am completely aware that I am barely above the minimum requirements to run the game. This is a hand-me-down PC that I'm still working on getting new parts for.

That being said, I ran into [i]constant[/i] crashes when I first started playing, and this was with the game's settings set as low as they could go. There was stuttering, and freezing, and all sorts of crazy stuff. I ended up having to go into NVIDIA's control panel and fiddle with some rendering settings just to get the game stable. 

Vsync was not an option for me, much to my chagrin (motion sickness issues), but I believe this is a me problem given the strain that vSync puts on the GPU and my GPU's inability to handle it.

Cutscenes were also still a pretty big problem even after my fiddling in the NVIDIA control panel. I had to cut power to the machine via the power supply switch at one point because a cutscene locked my computer up to the point where even holding the power button down wouldn't send a shutdown command.

[hr][/hr]

[h1][b][u]To Summarize: A solid 8/10 from me[/u][/b][/h1]

If you read everything above, I just want to say thank you for taking the time. I know that's a lot of opinion to throw about with only 40 hours of gameplay under my belt, but I wanted to write this while it was still fresh in my mind. Despite the nature of my Con's list might indicate, I would still highly recommend the game to anyone and everyone who asks me about it. 

I had one hell of a good time playing it, and am going to keep playing it for the post lvl 40 content (at least until the loot pinata stuff you unlock after beating the game gets stale). It's an amazing blend of the FPS and RPG genres and I was very satisfied with my purchase. 

I look forward to what the future of the game has to offer in the form of DLC and hope that this turns into as much of a long standing and active title as Borderlands 3 has (which I now fully intend to download on this PC and finally get around to playing).",1676556928,1676557049,True,237,6,0.879105150699615479,2,True,False,False

Visually the game has a very attractive feel to it, the guns i found were fun to use, there were enough styles and types to keep me happy! 

I very much enjoyed the character class selection followed by being able to link with another class shortly into the game! As i was playing solo i went spore and dragon pet build which just made life truly easy for my play through!

I thought the open world concept of walking across the map was very clever accompanied by the always quirky borderlands-esk humour and story line! 

Dont play this game thinking you'll be able to hardcore blast into the main story missions and wipe out the campaign as there are level hurdles where  zones require you to be a certain level before progressing which forces your hand to dive into side quests or grinding! 

Ill be honest there were times towards the end of the game that it fell off for me and felt stale, the guns were not doing the damage i wanted them to.. the mobs were irritating to fight with resists and burrowing.. some dialog quests contained alot of standing about...  i felt alot of the quest rewards and loot were really underwhelming so upgrades were in my play through quite disappointing.

The game did pick up again eventually when i did stumble onto some good loot :) and the over all story line was quite entertaining 

ABIT PRICEY, but you will enjoy it.

It was worth the cost for that alone. Seeing a fantasy version of Borderlands has been vastly entertaining, and the game has a surprising amount of heart.

The class mixing is a great touch and adds considerable re-playability. I'm on my third playthrough (back to back to back) and the game still hasn't gotten old.

The combat is solid. It's easily the best part of the game. Most of the guns feel fine. Sound good, look good- the medieval theme is- can be- fun.

Leveling and level scaling combine to make the combat feel samey throughout, with slightly different flavors of enemies.

Pros

Tiny Tina is always entertaining. The Bunkers and Badasses format is fun. As with everything in the BL universe, the open world is immersive and fantastically detailed. It's just a lot of fun to walk around and look at the scenery. The game is exactly what you would expect when Tiny Tina is in charge.

Cons

The game is just too easy. The boss fights are anemic. The side quests are only there for you to look at the scenery. They don't add anything to the game. The story line is too short. Without doing any side quests, you could sleep through the game in a couple of nights. The encounters are repetitive and after awhile, downright boring.

The story along with the presentation style feel like a chaotic homebrew TTRPG. That being said there are definitely some caveats. I recommend buying when it is on sale.

[h2]Better with Friends (and in cooperation IMHO)[/h2]
I have done three play throughs of the game. One by myself, one with a full party of four, and one with a single close friend.

[h3]By Myself[/h3]
It was like an excellent story game with good combat and a decent open world. I even spent the time to find all the luck dice. Loads of fun, but only once. Also the end game felt a bit shallow since there was no real reason to do it.

[h3]With a Single Good Friend[/h3]
It gave new life to the story since we could discuss it as it was happening. We had both previously played it alone and this was our second time through the game. At low levels we could get away with going to very high level areas since we could cover each others weaknesses. Since we knew how the game worked we also waited to do the side quests until after finishing the main story and hitting max lvl. This allowed us to get the side quest weapons in stronger versions. They are very comparable to most legendaries and can have entire build based around them [spoiler]rip and tear + buffmeister[/spoiler]. 

[h3]With a Full Party[/h3]
This truly felt like the chaos of my old teenage DnD sessions. One person would be trying to find collectables. Another would be organizing their inventory/shopping. Then some one else would be blowing through the map bypassing the story. I was there just enjoying the chaos of it all. 
The end game also seemed more interesting now that we can compete against each other for the best build.

[h2]End Game and Replay-ability[/h2]
I could definitely see myself coming back to this game. I recently got all the DLC and have not tried it yet. I am not sure how many full play throughs I have left in me. The end game still seems like it might have more to offer.

[h3]End Game[/h3]
I have only done the chaos chamber stuff and am at chaos rank 45. There is definitely a balance issue between weapons (Ruby/sword splosion OP). Every class has at least one viable build, but I am not sure about every combination of classes. I like the loot system in the chaos runs. It really cuts down on the grind times. My friend has an issue with the legendaries not feeling special or rare enough. I think this is fine as it allows you to try the build that you want without hours of hassle. I think that this is very fun provided that you still have quests remaining, otherwise it feels pointless.

[h3]Replay-ability[/h3]
I think that three, from the start, play throughs is a decent amount. I do not strongly feel the need to play it again in any of those fashions. The nice thing about cooperation mode is that the enemies scale to each individual. I can do another play through with someone else hosting as a lvl 6, but I join with a lvl 40 with chaos mode active and it is still a challenge. Unfortunately you do not get the quest rewards a second time. 
There is also something to be said for leveling one of each of the character. Leveling half the characters would also work due to the multiclass system. This would allow for every singe combination to be tried. I just wish the chaos ranks were account wide like the myth rank.

[h3]Wishful Thinking[/h3]
I think a new game + mode with different banter making fun of how broken the noobie is would have been fun. I would mostly want to attempt all the quests in different chaos ranks just to see how extreme the enemies get.",1675400358,1675541471,True,4,0,0.555178284645080566,0,True,False,False

I've been playing for 2 hours and EVERY SINGLE chest I've opened has had Trash tier guns or gear in it. When you fight your way through a Zone or find a hidden room, and open the chest, and all the guns are ""Blue or Green"" tier - it feels bad. But yet, you go to a Vending Machine in the city, it has 3 or 4 EPIC level guns to buy. 

This game can be fun at times, but the Loot system needs a rework BADLY.

Further, the enemies just become more Bullet Spongey as time goes on. Getting 200 ""Critical Hits"" on an enemy with ""Fire Weakness"" for example does not feel satisfying. Critical Hits should be special..

Also, you can't track more than one quest at a time. So you'll often bypass necessary objectives, enemies, or areas - just because you're tracking a different quest. But it's all in the same Zone and area.

Borderlands has fun gameplay and lots of cool guns, classes, and a neat world to inhabit. But it's really showing it's age from a Game Design perspective.

Couple that with the TRY TOO HARD writing where EVERY LINE has to try and be a joke - You've got a game with no stakes, no emotional resonance. The inventory needs work. The enemies AI needs work. The quest system needs work.

The writing feels mostly uninspired, with the ratio of laughable jokes being far below its predecessor's, its characters(!) and its DLCs. The gameplay feels sluggish at times, although probably being built upon its predecessor's foundation. The story's highlight, from my point of view, happened quite early in the game. Its DLCs add nearly nothing to the game apart from new loot and multiple, loosely connected series of semi-horde and arena combats.

Don't give up in the first 10 or so levels, it's a little slow and boring for the first few hours (dull starting areas, repetitive enemies and lame guns) but gets so much more fun later on. The guns get better as you get higher level, the areas become a lot more fun to explore and the side quests are entertaining. At least get to the ""ocean"" area before giving up. 

Some people will disagree with me, but I think the Borderlands series has only improved more and more over time (with the except of The Pre Sequel, which I consider to be the worst game). The gameplay has gotten more refined and polished, the graphics are fantastic, and the areas/zones are just bigger, better, more unique, and more fun to explore. The side quests in this game are the best in the series, in my opinion. The game is challenging enough without being frustrating like it could be in the first game. The dual class system is also the most fun character building system of any Borderlands games. I love being able to wear equipment (ring, necklace, chest, melee weapon, etc.), which only improves the ""loot hunting"" aspect. I love collecting all the customization drops, but I hate that we don't have gun skins like in Borderlands 3? Why not both? 

On to the negatives. The comedy is hit or miss, but that's how it is in every single Gearbox game, so nothing new. Claptrap is hilarious in this game, but some of the other minor characters are cheesy. Also just a general complaint about all Borderlands games that I've always hated: enemies respawn TOO fast. It should be like 30 minutes, not 5-10 as it seems in this game, which makes it annoying. The game could use some more endgame DLC, too. I don't know if they plan to release more but I hope they do. I know they said they're going to make more Wonderlands games, but I think it would be nice to make this one as big as possible first.

Usually if you have DLCs, their content is not open to other players who do not own them, which is understandable. In Tiny Tina's Wonderland it's actually DLC owners who lose content like e.g. graphics of items because apparently in multiplayer you cannot show item graphics if you happen to own DLCs (game actually even mentions you that) which is a bit weird because why would the player who actually has the more content not be able to see e.g. item graphics. So after a while of playing ALL item graphics start to disappear from your menus until every item you have have its graphics missing so you cannot separate amulet from a shotgun it you do not go and see the stats which you can use to identify which type of item it is. This continues you restart the game and go back to single player. Which makes the whole loot organizing even more pain in the donkey than what it usually is. Which is bit of a bunker buster in a game build around looting stuff. Also various quest related bugs you have to restart the game to get working again.

You cannot even copy paste shift-codes within the game. If you wanted to you'd have to register to separate web page to copy paste them there IF you wanted to do in conveniently. Funny how BL2 managed to do EVEN that better over 10 years ago. It's like technology is going back in time, or 2K want's to e.g. monetize people registering to their web-page or something. Because actual sense that decision does not make nor is the code to allow it complicated because it's a input field within a application.

The strongest side of this game is the humor. It contains it all, dirty jokes, geek references, absurd situations.

The weakest point is the gameplay : you basically will play all the same as the first hour and as the last chapter. It is smooth but if you're not into the humor ; it might feel very boring and repetitive.

Especially that the game is long. There's a lot of areas and quests. 60 to 70% of the content is just optional stuff (not main story) but the job done is huge and the game ain't worth it if you rush the main story.

Character creation is limited and varied at the same time. Limited cause you won't have a lot of choices within a skill tree and you'll have up 2 trees.
Varied cause the classes feel different and the character building will also go through equipment so you can specialize your class focus one elemental damage type or one particular strategy. 

The unvariable gameplay might make 60$ being too expensive for it but one the other hand, there's no frustating part, no major mistake, no reason to not finish the game or try 2 or 3 characters.

The DLC's are probably the worst I've seen for the pricetag in a while, and the lack of gun variety is just painful. I also find it more annoying that drop rates seem to be way more unforgiving compared to BL3, mind you I did think Legendaries dropped too frequently in BL3, they definitely toned it down here to the point of over-correction.

don't go in thinking its a D&D borderlands..

its borderlands with a magic sprinkle of it.. 
people saying its bland or the areas are copy and paste HAVE TO BE PLAYING SOMETHING ELSE!

pros
 over-world map is fun and filled with spirit.
jokes land like always.
classes aren't as odd to re-arrange...
spells over gernades and the new system for gear is very fun to mix and match with!

cons
some display errors on companion/friends health bars. 
a couple minor endless hole spots, really only found 2!
smaller map's mean more loading screens, but also better resolution....
you don't get a horse to ride... that would be the only mount i would want in this game.


all in all, Tiny Tina's wonderland is a cute, funny, explosive time that knows its a wall breaking game *sometimes.*
Having the voice cast they do is amazing.
*playing with the Grim voice and i her lines are AMAZING*

if you are someone who just goes nuts on fantasy and guns.
ITS A MUST BUY.
if you like borderlands or just the casual funny story/shooter not needing to know all the previous games this is a good title too!!

I've been with the Borderlands franchise since jump.  Tiny Tina's DLC from Borderlands 2 was legitimately an 11 on a scale from 1 to 10.  While Wonderlands has most of the same elements, it missed the mark for me.

Firstly, The fights no longer feel organic or fluid. It has all the fantastic looting and shooting of the older Borderlands.  I think for me personally, the problem is that they incorporated too many elements from Apex, Valorant and the like into the game.  The encounters with enemies feels less open world(after main game).  Where before I could really use my environment to my advantage and take my time, it now feels like i'm being dropped into the middle of an arena and rushed. 

Next, the game is indeed too short.  Insult onto injury for the rest of the game (after completing it in one sitting ((so glad I got it on sale)) its just arena fighting, over and over and over and over and over again, ad nauseam.  Which is fine if thats your thing but its not mine.  

Lastly, I couldn't find my class.  I tried each class except Bzzerker, none of them seemed to fit my play style.  Melee seems to play heavily into the synergy of each character.  After level cap is reached you expect to feel powerful but no matter my build each class was always lacking something.  The only way to increase your effectiveness would be to fight multiple arena fights to get better loot so you can fight more arena fights... just no.

So although I would recommend this game to people who are into arena/instance/encounter based gaming I wouldn't recommend to those who like me enjoyed the actual adventure.

I should note the game is put together beautifully, voice work is excellent, along with some fantastic writing that actually had me laughing out loud.",1671377723,1674773182,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I thought BL:TPS was fine(mostly cause it did a decent job of making Jack the villain he would become). But BL3, and now this...I just think Gearbox has lost the ideas it had before. TTWL is a game with a lot of memory for what made Borderlands appealing....but very little of what made it FUN. I'm not gonna touch on the DLC issues, because I'm reviewing the whole product that I got for $40. But I can cerrtainly understand the frustrations others may have had for ponying up $120 for this as a pre-order....which is why I didn't. 

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES
From a technical standpoint, TTWL is a decent game. There's a fair few visual splendor moments, the game runs....mostly above 60 on my machine, though there are moments where it just stops dead in its tracks and I think the game crashed for about five seconds before it picks back up. And certain locations just drag the game to sub-30 frames. I'm not running a bleeding edge machine, so I can give it some credit, but the two glitches combined, leave me wondering if there's some kind of memory sink that just isn't gonna be fixed in the game. 

ART STYLE
It's Borderlands. If you know it, you know it's the same style that is just getting up-rezzed more and more. It's not bad, but it's also not memorable. For me personally, I find the abundance of sparkles and glitter a little annoying, but I don't really slam it for that; this is supposed to be an RPG of sorts, so yeah, that should be a part of it. But the game has a tremendous amount of visual noise. It loves to throw light shows into everything, making trying to find the dark green monster against the dark green background, and next to the slightly lighter dark green monster annoying. 

SOUND
Again, it's Borderlands. While the story is okay, and Arnett, Burch and the BL voice actors do a good job of narrating it, it's still just a lot of pew-pew, boom-boom sound effects. You're not going to find the next soundscape here. 

GAMEPLAY
And we at last come to WHY I'm writing this review....the gameplay is horribly unbalanced. Maybe the game is meant to be played multiplayer. I've played BL1, 2, TPS, 3 and almost all the DLC for all three, and never have I felt so both underpowered, and beholden as a ""Fatemaker"" playing alone. 

I'll start with the smallest of sins: you can't really skip the narration when leveling and progressing the main story. You CAN skip the cutscenes(which ironically are better)...but after listening to the same pedantic story told again and again by floating pictures on screen so I can be allowed to see the next checkpoint or push he next button, I got bored REAL fast. Usually when one of the long ones start, I just go get myself a drink or surf online, and let the game run in the background. Dying doesn't really affect you, so you don't lose anything, and the game won't progress until you X the macguffin. But if you're making a story you can't interact with that also gets dull like a chainsaw made out of recycled paper, a skip option would be nice. From what I understand, modding the game by removing the some of the .pak files nixes the story in full. Take that as my commentary on the story's engagement: people found a way to literally tear the story out of the game, so they weren't bored to tears.

Combat is again...Borderlands. Nothing you will see here, is new or groundbreaking. If you've played anything prior to TPS...you know what you're getting. The multiclass system really isn't. You know your Moze/Axton/Roland build or your Amara/Maya/Lilith Build. And Critical Damage, of course, is still king of all builds. It's still making numbers change in different ways. 

The bosses during the story, are pushovers for the most part. Some are nice looking, others just blend into the background. But Chaos Levels basically break the game. After beating the game, you unlock Chaos Mode(Mayhem Mode or UVHM for those who are already yawning about this) You can then run a randomized set of instances, with a few bosses thrown into the mix. But here, the devs decided to swing balance well out of the player's control. SOULSBORNE games don't have the grind of some fights in Chaos Mode. A perfect example is Dry'l. In the game, your damage can outpace his shield healing fairly quickly. It makes him among the toughest fights during the story that you'll face, memorable, but not insanely difficult.....

In Chaos Mode, that changes. Dry'l's shield will INSTANTLY regenerate from nothing to almost full, every 45 seconds. So if you don't have a finely tuned lightning damage focused build that can do (infinity x million)^2 damage, you're stuck with a boss you won't ever damage after phase 1. This kind of boss fight is rife throughout Chaos Mode. Another is the Eros Wyvern, who flies around a stage, and shotgun-blasts AoE damage shots that ALSO regen their THREE health bars. If you get hit by one pellet, I'd say it gets 1/6th of a health bar back. You can't freeze them, you can't really poison them, you can't focus on them, and you have to play pillar-peekaboo to avoid the regen effect. There are fights where a main enemy is just wholly immune, or can't be reached by your build(Melee players know this one all too well), or has some insane catchup mechanic. it robs the game of any kind of challenge. To be clear, challenge is setting a clear, understandable goal before you, and providing the means and tools to achieve that goal. This isn't challenge, this is trying to ape the ways of From Software and call it original. I'm not personally a fan of Souls-like games, and when I realized that is what TTWL is ultimately, I stopped playing and started writing. 

FINAL JUDGEMENT
I think Gearbox has become another developer that's trying to ride the coattails of past greatness. So fixated on recreating the magic of BL2,  Gearbox can no longer see anything but ways to repackage that game with more modern visuals or ideas....note that I said more MODERN...not BETTER. TTWL is the game to get if your Borderlands themed bedroom still had three square feet of uncovered wall, and you just couldn't take it anymore. In the broad strokes, it's another Borderlands game....that was new and exciting a decade ago. Today, it's just a relic of big gaming.",1674709839,1674709839,False,2,0,0.496775895357131958,1,True,False,False

This game has a decently large open world, with many objectives per zone, including objectives in the 'Overworld.'
The plot of the game stays consistent and fun even through all of the side quests. I blasted through the game in the last couple weeks, and can definitely see myself going back to 100% it over time.
After you complete the campaign, there is end-game progression called 'Chaos Runs,' which get a little repetitive, but the upgraded weapons you get are increasingly fun to use.

TLDR: awesome shooter in the classic looter shooter style of borderlands but with some refreshing additions along side a great cast and challenging endgame content!

It's been a wild ride playing this game, an interesting twist on the standard borderlands franchise which I've loved - the main characters being voiced by some of my favourite comedy actors (Will Arnett, Andy Samberg and Wanda Sykes) a great cast - if you love the dumb jokes all borderlands have you'll really enjoy this one - also adds some depth to Tina which hit close to home for me.

As for gameplay, it's nice to have a borderlands where you can customize your own hero even your classes too, yeh I get people aren't happy about the 3 trees but you pick your starting class then have a sub class which can make for some awesome synergies with which you can change once you finish the main story. 
For me it's great because you can really chop and change your playstyle on the fly/test out builds, really get into creating your own hero.

The spells in the game are a really nice addition aswell as the necklaces - it adds more to your builds, on normal BL you have your shields and mod but that's it, on TT it adds another layer which is more craziness. 

Each area has loot dice to find which ups your loot luck, I enjoyed finding them it really made you want to explore every nook and cranny of the maps and once you got all of them in all areas you got a beefy permanent boost to your luck.

The level cap is kind of low (40) you get to add attribute points each level up which makes it more like a classic RPG. The myth ranks at max level are nice, it still allows you to build on your character like badass rank but better imo as there's more bespoke options to really hone your builds.

The DLC I've been really enjoying, it's like 4 different multistage quests each having a main objective and an optional sub (which gives you more loot on each stage) enemies drop soul crystals which you spend to get loads of loot in the dlc hub area. 
The catch to each one is there's no save point, no checkpoints so you have to beat the whole thing to complete it - if you're playing with a buddy and they die they can't respawn until the other player has completed that stage of the mission, so if you die you're out until the next stage of the quest begins. 
You also can't leave or teleport out of a stage when you start a mission.
Each quest in the dlc after it's been beat adds another difficulty, up to difficulty 4 - I've only beaten tier 3 and it's been a real challenge.

At end game there's the chaos chamber, I've only just gotten that content unlocked and it's been really challenging so far - it even has secret bosses which honestly has kicked my ass! I breezed through the game on hard by my god the chaos levels really up the difficulty and push your builds to their limit. 
It's been awesome so far like a real new and refreshing addition to the game, curses, blessings, buffs, portals, crystals, puzzles, secret bosses, loot, EVERYTHING!

Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another 24?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can do it all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, messed around and got a triple-double
Freakin' brothas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day
[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a brotha's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of homies
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my homie's house paid (Word)
Picked up a girl been tryna dig since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
Felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my jimmy runs deep, so deep
So deep put her butt to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her butt off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for the murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp""
Drunk as hell but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say it was a good day

Great improvements from the gameplay perspective, pistols, assault rifles and shotguns got a full remake and a great one, snipers are finally good in close quarters etc.

Tiny Tina is, as she always was, a great character, and it felt refreshing to see the world from her perspective.

But there are major problems with the game.

- Dialog is usually too long or drags for too much. The two other `players` you play with are really dull and uninteresting, with maybe one or two interesting lines in the while game. Player character tho has some really good comments and lines, that are MUCH better than the voices NPC-s.

- Animations are stiff, especially with the character talking or gestures, which is something that is not easily seen in a game from 2020+

- Enemies constantly run away from you, making you run to them, and they start running again if you get close. This only happens with some ranged enemies, but its REALLY dumb and annoying.

- Rocket Launchers went from being really good in B2 and B3 to being low tier trash here.

- There is no replay value. I have leveled all classes to max and did everything with them, just to figure out there is no New Game+ or beyond, just a rouge-like mode when you hit lvl 40.

Overall, get it on sale, WITHOUT any DLC-s.

EVERY [i]Borderlands[/i] game suffers from a badly-implemented level-scaling system which makes leveling up pointless, most of your guns useless, and the gunplay so tedious that I have literally fallen asleep while playing it with my brother.

EVERY [i]Borderlands[/i] game has bad map design, poor level design, and lousy UI. However, THIS abomination somehow made the UI even WORSE and ruined one thing which I had always liked about the series, that being the character design.

[h1]No [feminine] girls allowed[/h1]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2911684581

This is just sexist. You can play as a man or you can play as an exceptionally MASCULINE woman. This is NOT ""progressive""; it may be INTENDED to allow Randy Pitchford to say that he's a good boy but what it actually does is deprive EVERYONE including WOMEN of the chance to play as a cute girl. 

A LOT of women (including trans women btw) would like to be able to play as a cute girl (like Gaige or Moze from previous games) even if they don't look like that in real life in the same way that many men (including trans men) would like to be able to play as a huge hulk in a video game even if they are smaller than that when outside of the game. 

I won't complain about more options being in a game (I never had any problem with the gay romance options in [i]Mass Effect[/i] for instance nor did I complain about the trans character options in [i]Cyberpunk[/i]) but it DOES bother me when the options I like are removed, apparently because a cynical corporation under the guidance of Randy Pitchford wants head pats for being ""progressive"".

[h1]Map Design[/h1]

The maps seem designed to confuse and frustrate you which considering that Randy Pitchford once shared a video of a cat being hurt in order to mess with people, may be the point. Where it REALLY sucks however is when the bad map design interacts with the TERRIBLE UI. In order to move the map a relatively small distance so you can see something a short distance from you, you have to drag the mouse off the desk. 

I kept finding that my mousepad literally wasn't big enough to accommodate the dramatic, sweeping motions necessary to move the map to where I wanted it... even with mouse acceleration turned on. Perhaps it's better with a controller... or perhaps it's deliberately annoying. When you are dealing with studio led by a man a man who shares videos of animal cruelty, you never know...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eO3UFsjv-g

[h1]Bad level-scaling[/h1]

When level-scaling is done right, for instance as implemented in ESO or SWTOR, I don't mind it. In this game however, the level-scaling makes the enemies even more bullet-sponge than usual and ensures that you rarely have a gun you like and even when you do, you have to throw it away almost as soon as you get it.

You can't upgrade the guns and they are set to whatever your level is when you get them. This means that every time you level-up, which happens a lot, your guns start to suck. At any given time, you won't actually have very many guns of the right level so despite the theoretical promise of ""zillions"" of procedurally-generated guns, the fact that most of them are trash means you will be stuck with a gun you don't like in this game far more often than in most other shooters.

[h1]Too much trash loot[/h1]

Your inventory in this game quickly fills up with low-quality trash that has no real function except to be sold. As a result, you spend a HUGE amount of time in this game going to or looking for shops to sell your trash as opposed to shooting or exploring. This game is TEDIOUS.

[h1]Boring combat[/h1]

The gunplay in this game is basically what you would expect from an MMORPG. Only the stats really matter because the time-to-kill is painfully low (and is made worse by the aforementioned level-scaling system.) As a result, I literally found myself falling asleep playing this game. It's BORING when you win and when you lose, it's because your guns suck... or you fell asleep.

[h1]Creepy, unsatisfying, and transgressive when not cringe and virtue-signalling[/h1]

The ""writing"" in this product suffers from the same problem as the [i]Velma[/i] atrocity. It's always trying to signal its conformity to certain cultural trends while at the same time constantly trying to gross you out with its attempts to be transgressive... it also never stops trying to be meta. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7lGf_WBZJA

When you aren't helping a gay couple find true love or doing something else clearly intended to check a box, you will find yourself being an exceptionally nasty person with absolutely no choice in the matter because Randy Pitchford seems to have only two speeds which are PC virtue-signalling and ""I bullied those completely innocent people until they DIED on behalf of a literal demon! Ain't I a stinker!""

Basically, this game feels like it was made by combining the gross ideas from [i]TLOU Part 2[/i] and [i]Hatred[/i] with the cringe of the [i]Saint's Row[/i] reboot. It's just gross.

If you aren't both incredibly PC and a hateful TROLL, you will HATE the writing in this game (and I am saying this as someone who loves [i]Saint's Row 3[/i].)

This actually made me sad because I really liked the story of [i]Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck[/i] which surprised me by actually being GOOD. Gearbox CAN do better; they just don't. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

If you want to play an extremely TEDIOUS game with a story that seems to have been written by the people responsible for [i]Velma[/i], this might be for you...

I think the best thing for this franchise is for the next game in the series to bomb so badly that they actually fix the fundamental problems with the gameplay and hire a creative director who likes what normal people like (as opposed to animal cruelty and whatever other sick garbage some people at Gearbox are apparently into.)",1673763368,1674272730,False,9,1,0.412897288799285889,11,True,False,False

Every quest and side quest, every collectible, every piece of DLC. I have done so partly out of spite and partly out of a desire to make this review as thorough as possible.

[h1] Issue #1: Skill trees [/h1]

Unlike previous games in the franchise, where you choose a character with 3-4 skill trees to play around with, Wonderlands instead has you choose a Class: classes have two Action Skills to choose from and one single Skill Tree. After a certain point in the campaign, you're able to choose a secondary Class and choose from their skill tree and Action Skill. The maximum level is 40, and you have a total of 44 Skill Points to play around with.

The first major issue with this system: not enough Skill Points to experiment with builds. 44 skill points are enough to reach the final skill in a single class' Skill Tree and reach the 4th tier of skills in another (barely). Builds, as such, are basically always the same: you can't afford to experiment with different playstyles or skill choices.
Secondly: quite a few classes have zero synergy between them: often times you're forced to get skills you have no use for just so you can reach another tier. 
Worst of all, the skill trees themselves are boring and poorly designed, and there is no skill support for many playstyles. Here's an example:

The Spore Warden is the closest thing to a sniper class the game has. Its passive grants it a Mushroom Companion which deals Poison (Corrosive) damage and its skills are centered around Critical Hits. I'll discuss a few skills which I believe exemplify its poor design.
Quiver of Holding: Increases magazine size for all guns by 30% and grants them constant ammo regen (9% of the mag/second). 
Wrath of Nature: Enemies hit by Ability Damage take 30% increased damage from all sources. 
Play the Angles: Scoring a Gun Critical Hit has a 35% chance of making the bullet ricochet towards a nearby enemy, dealing Ability Damage. 

Sniper rifles as an archetype have small magazine sizes, fire slowly (barring a few exceptions) and deal a lot of damage: therefore they don't benefit from Ammo Regen and don't proc ricochets often enough to benefit from Wrath of Nature. Using a Sniper Rifle on the *only class* that has significant buffs to Critical Damage is a complete waste of time, because you're better off using something with a large magazine size and high fire rate, like an AR, pistol or SMG. 

Here's another example: the Clawbringer. It lacks damage bonuses to make it competitive with other classes, its action skills take too long to be usable, its action skill augments are worthless, some skills just do nothing (Indomitable), and what buffs it has to Companions are exclusive to its own companion and don't benefit others in any way. 

The lack of support for different playstyles is noticeable: non-elemental guns are almost universally outclassed when so many characters are based around specific damage types. The Blightcaller's entire skill tree revolves around status effects, the Clawbringer relies on fire and lightning, the Graveborn needs black magic to keep itself alive, the Brr-zerker benefits from stacking Cold damage: you're almost always better off using an element.

[h1] Issue #2: The gunplay [/h1]

Borderlands started off as an FPS, and while it's completely understandable and even commendable to have the franchise branch off in another direction, guns in Wonderlands feel like an afterthought. The addition of ""proper"" melee combat is certainly something. On one hand, being able to customize exactly how your character uses its melee attack is very fun and interesting, and opens up a lot of build variety (even for gun builds! you can use melee weapons as utility tools). On the other, it's another layer of grinding and even more items to dilute a boss' loot pool. 
In addition to melee weapons, Wonderlands also introduces Spells, which replace grenades. They're cooldown-based rather than ammo-based, so they feel a lot more spammable. 

Spells and melee combat are very clearly the main focus when it comes to skill tree support. As previously mentioned, the Spore Warden is the only class with significant gun buffs: though some other classes have skills that benefit gunplay (the Blightcaller's Geist in the Shell and part of the Spellshot's tree) the emphasis for almost every other character is either melee or spell combat. Even the Spellshot, whose final skill gives him a chance to instantly reset his spell cooldowns upon scoring a gun critical hit, is better off spamming Spells (usually Laserhands). 
Though playing with guns is viable (yes, even non-elemental ones), the gunplay generally feels bad: every attack (whether gun, melee, or spell) has a chance of critically hitting, so aiming for headshots isn't as rewarding because you can just spam bodyshots and be just as effective. Some enemies actively disencourage aiming for Crits: Cyclops have their critical spots disappear after taking a certain amount of damage and become Enraged, dealing increased damage and moving faster. Unlike Goliaths in BL2, where removing their helmets exposed a crit spot, Cyclopi are impossible to crit outside of random crit procs after their eye is destroyed. 

More than anything else, guns feel bad: 
[list]
[*]Crossbow-type weapons fire arcing projectiles which stick to enemies and increase the damage of subsequent shots: the arc is noticeable and annoying to aim, especially on guns with low projectile speed
[*]Shotguns firing energy blasts: no real visual or audio feedback to denote a hit outside of damage numbers: they're strong, but it *feels* like you're not hitting things

Base game: 

1) Solid game with different fun classes to mix and match but falls flat with story since it feels like something I've seen from a certain BL2 dlc(only one part stood out and that was with a returning side character). 

2) To get better loot you'll have to hunt down dice in different sections of the world...have fun getting poop tier weapons until you get enough dice for better drops

3) Endgame is just running chaos chambers(repetitive dungeons with modifiers and are on the same map) to upgrade your chaos level( like mayhem mode in BL3) and getting ""ascended"" gear. 

I would wait for a sale unless your REALLY like the DnD elements shown here(which for me it didn't click as much as other people)

Absolute fucking scam; do not waste your money unless you get the season pass super cheap(like I did) but even then its still not worth it.

Now, here's my list of personal complaints:

Whenever I activate my primary skill, the in-game music and sound-effects suddenly vanish and it affects my PC's drivers. Quitting out the game // restarting Steam doesn't solve the problem, resetting my PC temporarily solves the problem. I vowed to never cast Polymorph ever again.

While using an RTX 2060, entering a random encounter causes the UI to glitch out (checkerboard patterns and artifacting on the map, subtitles, objectives, etc.) One way to solve this problem is to downgrade from Direct X 12 to 11 and disable AMD FSR 2--which is a wonderful feature to boost FPS.

The developers haven't improved the UI while navigating the inventory / skills. The way how browsing your weapons takes up a lot of visual space, but it doesn't provide enough information on what weapons are better than the other without having to open another tab. I.e. not enough space is used meaningfully, and too much space is used for clutter.
In other words, you found some good loot, and it'll take you longer than it should to equip them with confidence while your friends are running far ahead of you in-game.

However, I like this game because I get to play with friends who are enjoying the experience. And, if they're having fun, so am I!
It's not a PvP experience that's stressful and toxic towards each other. It's a PvE! Let's be silly with some good writing, humorous storytelling, and appreciative DnD themes where we can all laugh and have a good time!

That experience alone is why I recommend this game <3

I played it up until the point where you get the Brutal Narrative Dissonance achievement, which happens to also be the point where they totally ruin the immersion, hilarity, and all three characters at once, and the worst part is that it feels forced as fuck.

From the very start of the game, things feel off. You have stats that give modifiers, and backgrounds that are... Locked off if you didn't pay for a specific DLC, one of them being the most useful one that would probably give you the best time all the way through. Same for an entire class, tied to the same DLC. Oof.

From then on, the entire game just kinda... Drags on. A lot. It assumes you're going to explore everywhere and do every sidequest in order to be at the right level, but, uh... When the earliest of those side areas is the goblin mountain where things will insta-down you, it doesn't hit right. Especially not with these... Not-guns.

They basically just took actual guns, mangled them into more-fantastical ""hey it's not a gun guys"" versions, then gave them bad mechanics, like the smgs and shotguns firing slow projectiles instead of fast bullets, or the stuck tnts, not rockets, from Torgue weapons being op as fuck on the pistol versions. Then comes the... Basically pointless additon of spells and melee. Both... Have 0 purpose. You're going to be shooting, not casting, cause your not-guns have more dps than the entire spin-up, aim, and cast of a single spell. Melee just... No? It only felt vaguely worth using when the enemies were getting too annoying, but again, it always did less damage than the guns and was basically pointless the entire way through.

Shields are the exact same as in the other game, rings and necklaces give barely anything, and the class mods are... Worse than usual, especially if you play a certain way, then get a mod that gives you EXACTLY what you need, then you're stuck looking that way for the rest of the game because nothing else gives the same skillpoints.

The elemental system, and the enemies having innate requirements to defeat them is garbage. Skeletons, the most common enemy, basically force you to use Cryo weapons unless you want to feel like you don't have enough dps at all times. Sometimes they're shielded, though, and, that means lightning damage is required. Oh, but did I mention the Mushrooms that require you to have Corrosive? Do you see the issue there? You now NEED to have a weapon of those elements to feel like you're dealing real damage to them, meaning you're constrained to whatever terrible mangled guns you find that have those elements, and can't really shift too much from that, unless you get a Torgue weapon with basic damage and the Stuck TNT mechanic, because those will consistently give you enough DPS at all times. Oh, and, PS: Dark Damage is going to take up your last slot so that you can survive bosses or get your hp back when you need it. Sorry nothing, there go your 4 slots.

Now for what everyone else has already said that seems true:
The level cap is way too low.
The DLCs are overpriced AS HELL for what they actually give you. You can buy other, longer and better games for the price of one dlc in this one.

What everyone else seems to have wrong:
The voice acting is absolutely fine. You have two new actors, one for the two new people introduced into the game, one of which sounds like, and is, a normal human guy, the other is a rule-based robot with the voice of a black woman. They're both fine, they sound fine. The other voice-acting in the game is done by either new people, or people returing from 3, such as Lorelai coming back to voice Paladin Mike, or Cole coming back to voice the Mage in the cliffs. Otherwise, the NPCs sound like borderlands characters. Shoutout to whoever did the skeletons, though, because they actually sound like funny borderland skeletons, especially when they make borderlands-tier jokes every few seconds in battle.

Ah right, the enemies. People have said every enemy is a skeleton. They're wrong. You have skeletons, mushrooms, drakes, goblins, merfolk, pirates, cultists and crabs. They're mostly seen in certain areas by the way. It'd be more fair to say skeletons are the most common enemies, because that's actually true. The main villain IS a necromancer, after all, and the main quest does happen to also have you go through an area with pirates who were already cursed with undeath through various means. Makes sense that the antagonist would antagonize the players throughout the story, just... Maybe they overdid it a bit.

Overall, imagine Borderlands but squashed forcibly into a fantasy context with a slight paywall affecting actual gameplay. The DLC in 2 had actual guns, too, not crammed-into-context ones. (Blackpowder ones do exist, but that's literally just Jakobs as normal, and those guns actually also happen to be the weakest ones here.)

The guns are horrible to use, and feel extremely clunky. I suppose you could chalk that up to them trying to be 'medieval' or 'magical' but they're just not fun to use. Meanwhile, the main thing that's fun to use are the spells, which are often extremely powerful and useful, and honestly should have replaced the guns entirely. The problem of course is that because spells are so much better than the guns, there's only one real build, so there's not a ton of reason to experiment with characters.

Fans like me have been wanting another Bunkers & Badasses iteration since the pretty universally beloved Tiny Tina's Campaign of Carnage DLC. I don't think there's anything controversial about saying that CoC had such a fantastic story and technical execution that it could stand up to many full-on AAA releases. 

So what's so weird about this? 

Let's start with the softball stuff, performance and technical. 
I run this game on a fossil. An i7-4770K with a *modest* overclock, a GTX-1080 running slightly undervoltage to keep noise down, and 16gb of G.Skill SNiper RAM from around 2010. THis thing is a proper potato. Yet, I run it at 1440P with all settings maxed out, it holds 60FPS pretty consistently. So as a matter of optimization, it runs as well as BL3. Not unexpected.
There are some *strange* bugs though. Textures will only partially load and then hang and leave an area looking like a 1990's  2.5D shooter minus the crispiness, or they won't load at all. VO portraits won't load in. Onscreen prompts will hang on the interact button indefinitely, requiring a trip to the inventory screen to fix. Pet health bars will be stuck on KO forever regardless of pet health. Animations will play incorrectly or not at all. THe entire screen will lock for a fraction of a second and then skip another half second or so of frames upon killing a large enemy. 

All together it's annoying but not game breaking. 

Now, on a gameplay level. 

Everything seems to work as intended. I built a pretty busted clawbringer/spore warden who in general is a one-man meat grinder and the phallic mushroom and tiny dragon are, for the most part, just along for the ride until I run into a boss which requires stronger elemental damage than my barely-literate character can take a bite out of. It works well. THe level perks are all useful, though none are particularly flashy and few are super interesting. That's fine. There's a balance between effective leveling, building a playstyle through experimentation, and needing to work to get the really interesting bonuses. 
This is fine. 

What's not fine is the scaling enemies. They never really get more difficult or need more complicated strategy. THey just come at you in slightly larger numbers. THis means that there's no reason to ever do any side quest unless it specifically interests you and you want to find out what happens. 

But don't worry. That doesn't mean there's no grind. In fact, much of the game is laid out as a grind now. The game is now structures around interconnected dungeons linked with a simplified 2.5D hub world. If you're imaging a JRPG with a scaled-down overworld you walk around to go from towns to caves to castles to what-have-you, that's pretty much on point. 
The dungeons themselves are the issue. Imagine an endless chain of arena-shooter fights with very similar enemies for whom the optimal strategy is invariably ""Shoot many bullets"". Now imagine that the relative difficulty or intensity never changes because all enemies and encounters scale to your level. 

If you enjoy repetitive multiplayer FPS arena games, this structure is going to be very familiar and comfortable for you. 
If you're looking for a Borderlands title with wildly varied architecture, exciting setpieces, and tons of weird enemies for you to develop moving strategies to fight against on the fly, this is going to leave you a little confused, a little fatigued, and a little bored. This is *especially* true for the popup ""encounter"" game areas, which work exactly like a deathmatch arena. You spawn in, have a brief countdown timer, then you have to just kill until you fill up a bar. This is the same for most side dungeons too. 

So now, the writing.

Borderlands is known for being over the top, and a lot of the humor is grounded in such a way that it fits well into a a heavily stylized but ultimately serious story. Moments of levity punctuate a ridiculous, but not necessarily inherently goofy world. THe games are funny, but not because they're constantly trying to make every moment into either an absurdist take or a pop culture reference or a fart joke. It's because they know how and when to slip those into an otherwise sorta relatively dark story in a way that breaks up that darkness and rejects grimness entirely. and especially with the original CoC DLC, uses measured silliness to approach very difficult and painful subject matter without letting it become exhausting or tedious.

Wonderlands isn't a serious concept painted in over-the-top stylized shapes and colors and sprinkled with a strong but manageable helping of fart jokes. Wonderlands is an aspiring middle-school stand up comedian who forgets he was telling a joke about a complex social subject and then switches over to a fart joke halfway through a 30 second anecdote. And then keeps doing it over, and over, and over again. While standing on a pair of whoopie cushions. What little emotional buildup Wonderlands earns is immediately deflated with poorly timed body humor or some kind of pop culture reference that gets overworked to the point of tedium. Few characters stick around long enough for you to get interested in their deal. I think the longest arc anyone had were the gay pirate skeleton lovers, and that's because they were around for a whopping *two* quests. The story clearly wants to say something, wants you to feel something, but it really doesn't give you much to work with. 
The main quest line kinda loses focus after you blow up the ocean. Instead of having some kind of specific goal to accomplish in each area, the goal becomes ""Get through the area"" and the goal is juswt kind of a tangent that you need to go off on in order to finish passing through the area. THat can work fine as a detour to add flavor or to add depth to the world, but here it just feels like padding. THe good news is that you can skip almost anything you deem to be inconsequential because none of it matters due to the scaling enemy difficulty. If you can call that good news. 

I picked this game up because I was itching for more Borderlands and the premise held a lot of promise for me. I've played all of the Borderlands games save for the Telltale titles because I just have no interest in that type of game. I ended up a little disappointed and have been coasting by finishing the game to try to get to the expected emotional payoff at the story's end. After that I'm unlikely to pick it up again
THe bottom line is that I do not recommend this game unless you're a big fan of the structure of multiplayer online shooters, you're a Borderlands completionist, or both. At least look for a sale.

This game is pretty cool. I payed 30 dollars for this game and that's the most it should cost. The story is... fine? Jokes are shit, characters are well voice acted, general plot is maybe above average. Gameplay is pretty good, not without flaw but definitely not lacking in quality. Once you complete the main story, the game becomes a sort of roguelite, allowing you to go from randomly selected area to area, fight random enemies, and get better gear continually for quite some time. I would have liked a new game+ fairly well, but i guess this'll do. Also, all the DLC is shit, apparently.
Respec is weird. You can only respec your multiclass, skill points, and hero points. You'd better make damn certain that you like your class and background, because you can't change them. Same goes for Myth Ranks, which are like ""Guardian Ranks"", though I've never played BL3. In fact, I don't know much about Myth Ranks either, since my game had a game-breaking bug 48 hours in that made it so I couldn't get any xp for them. Only one other person on the internet had my problem and they didn't get a solution either. Probably because this game has an incredibly small fanbase. Oh well, that's my run over, I guess.
If the series continues, I'd really like to see some writers who could write a story that's solid as well as jokes that wouldn't make me embarrassed if someone walked in on me listening to them. And I really hope the series does continue. Borderlands is a very satisfying series to play.

Borderlands is great, and this is a fresh take on it. It's still borderlands at its heart. There are guns, spells, jumping around, and goofy dialogue, but it's still different too. Instead of just traveling places by running/driving there, you walk on a world map as a giant character piece (like literally walk, not click and go). You can run into random encounters, enter random dungeons, and pick up side quests both on the map and in those dungeons. I will admit, the encounters do quickly become repetitive (there is one where you're at this stone bridge, I've probably done that one 35 times), but the dungeons and side quests are still fresh and unique. 

The classes are fun and different from typical borderlands, but they do feel a bit lacking sometimes. I chose the poison guy (drawing blank on the name) and I was expecting more poison barrels and poison companions etc. Instead it's really just bonus damage to poison items and status effects. Once I hit level 21 I was able to choose a side-class, and I chose one that had a mushroom companion. He does help but seems really weak and useless at times. I just wish they had more of a DnD feel with companions instead of solo run-and-gun. Either way, I am enjoying it.

Inside your little ""base"" there are portals to do dungeons and each time you complete them you can make them more difficult. I was having a ton of fun with that. Reminded me a bit of tiers in other dungeon crawlers. They're actually incredibly challenging too. You die once and you have to restart. First difficulty is not too bad but man the bosses are INSANE on higher difficulties. 

Overall, I'd give it a solid 7.5/10. It's definitely good, it's not mindblowing, but if you like borderlands you will like this. If you like DnD styled games with goofy dialogue you may like this. If you're looking for a FPS of Divinity OS with serious dialogue and complex battle you probably will feel let down.",1673565122,1673565122,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Wonderlands is a fun game, it has the same style of gun play and snarkiness that I loved from the other games BUT...BUT...BUT...it is a game with a lot of issues. 

First, the bugs are many and sloppy.  The co-op gameplay is hampered by all sorts of visual bugs, audio bugs, latency bugs, and downright game freezes that require you to kill the game from task manager to continue.  Honestly, for as long as this game has been out, you would think most of this would be fixed.  Of all of the Borderlands games this is by far the buggiest game.

As far as gameplay, it does have the Borderlands sense of humor, but it really is not as good and I fear that the forced wokeness has crept in and really just ruined the fun.  Many of the jokes are meh at best.  It seems a waste since Tina is one of their best characters from the franchise.

There are lots of guns, weapons and spells...which offer an interesting twist but in truth, they spells aren't all that different than the regular BL grenades which is what the spells replace.  I do like the classes and the addition of a character editor is very welcome, but they don't feel a whole lot different than what we had in BL 1, 2 & 3.

Now, after finishing the main story and all of the sidequests (I don't own any DLCs) I can say that the stories are okay, there were several instances of very funny dialogue but it is by far the weakest entry in the Borderlands franchise.  IMO the BL2 Tiny Tina DLC was better and hit much harder on all levels.

There also is the problem of this game trying to force itself into a Teen rating.  It's ultra violent but can't mention alcohol and ham fisting in ""soda"" and ""Non-alcoholic"" everywhere in the dialogue is just nuts.

My suggestion is to buy the game on sale as it really does seem like a half effort from the studio.  Skip the DLC as well since they didn't seem to put any effort into those.

Having finally come to Steam you would have expected the game to have grown a bit from it's initial release and a few more of these co-op bugs to be fixed.  Oh well.",1672627855,1673548352,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd say this is more of a Neutral than Yes or No. [Scroll down for the TLDR version]

The main story is unique and fun with the D&D twist.
  ..it is also very linear.

The character builds are extensive.
  ..but they change very little overall it's still mostly a gun game.

Endgame grinding goes up to level 100 now!
  ..sadly the repeating dungeon you farm in is also the only end game. You are farming just to farm it on a higher level.
   ...it's also 1 level unlock at a time from 51+ and not account-wide.

Tiny Tina was great if a bit forced at times.
 ..the Robot and DLC narrator voices now make me want to play it on mute. 



TLDR: Same premium price as previous titles with maybe 1/5 of the content and replay value.

Pros:

+ Intriguing blend of fairy tale influences and Borderlands-style technology
+ The game becomes quite fun after the story ends and it just a gliding mode
+ The game mechanics are well crafted and offer a unique gameplay experience
+ It has a good number of missions and side quests which makes the game more enjoyable and engaging.
+ The game art and design is visually stunning and eye-catching
+ The dialogue and story-telling approach is funny and witty, adding to the overall enjoyment of the game
+ The game uses a boardgame-like structure to present the story, which adds an additional layer of interest and intrigue to the gameplay

Cons:

- User interface is difficult to navigate, with keybind overlaps making it hard to see the value of items.
- More glitches present in this game compared to Borderlands 3, such as guns that are unable to shoot bullets in co-op play
- Unskippable credit scene, although frustrating, can be understood as a necessary acknowledgement of the hard work of the developers and creators of the game, but a skip option should have been available.",1673336302,1673336302,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

= Intro = 

Yeah, I'm a sucker for Borderlands, even though they sometimes get right up my snout and seem to rely too much on 'if we keep talking, maybe we'll accidentally be funny' writing. But everyone loved Dragon's Keep - so what would happen if Dragon's Keep was  fleshed out into Borderlands 3.5, the Re Sequel?

= Gameplay: 8/10 =

It's Borderlands, except now guns are replaced with crossbows. And also guns. Oh and melee combat is okay. And you have spells instead of grenades.

The main campaign is Tiny Tina DMing again in an obvious Dungeons and Dragons knockoff, with two players and you. 

It's...yeah. Let's just say - this doesn't start well. It's really slow and generic until...a thing happens involving the ocean (honestly the only joke in the game that completely lands, but this one lands hard), after which it actually becomes pretty fun. 

Of course, the entire game is basically one big reference - occasionally insightful stuff about the nature of TTRPGS, DMing (which as a DM of 20+ years I definitely found myself smiling at) and it does occasionally have a few things to say about why people enjoy D&D and why it's become as popular as it has - but...ugh. Let me put it this way. 

It has a Star Wars: 'I am your father' moment. Not a joke, not playing around with it, just that reference. And that should tell you all you need to know about most of the humour. Sometimes it got a chuckle, a lot of the time I wanted to smash it over the head until it stopped talking at me.

The combat is as good as always, but it feels bit less massive and epic than BL3 did, and with the crapzillion different guns and stuff added to BL3 over the course of 4 full DLCs (1 of which being halfway good) it...does feel like you may as well just play BL3 again.

But it all works, and I did have...fun playing it. Mostly. 

= Graphics & Audio: 4/10 =

The visuals are fine, although it feels like for maybe a 20% enhancement in overall prettiness, we've taken a 500% hit to performance - not everyone has a card that can DLSS it's way to running stuff at a higher framerate, and stuff doesn't really look that much better now than it did 4 years ago - it just runs worse. 

The audio though...one of BL's strongest aspects has been it's incredible ambient soundtracks (many of which have found their way into my own D&D playlists) and TTW barely even has a soundtrack.

One thing that I have to mention though - and this sort of thing doesn't usually grate like it did here, but the game feels like it needs to inject hyper-partisan progressive politics wherever it can, and this is the sort of thing that can feel incredibly forced, smug and self satisfied. LGBT character can work, if they are treated like actual characters - Hammerlock and what's-his-face from BL3 were great. But here, it feels like every second character is trans, gay, lesbian, an objectophile (not kidding, there's like 3 of these) or what have you and it comes over...just weird and contrived. 

And yeah - as mentioned - smug. There is a smugness problem that runs through this game and it does rub me up the wrong way at times. Especially since, while it occasionally seems that the story is going in an interesting or even profound direction - it never does.

= Value: 8/10 =

Yeah...it's not a short game, but not a long one either, and it still manages to feel padded at times (and even cracks jokes about this - naturally, smugly). And the DLC is pretty crap. I got it half off and I'd say I got my money's worth, but it was a close thing. If I'd bought it for full price I'd have been annoyed.

Three things hold it back.

The aforementioned awful DLC, and the way the class system only has one tree per 'class', but you pick a second class a bit of the way in so it's running on Titan Quest logic now. Sounds okay, and there are some interesting synergies, but it also feels like substantially less effort to make.

The endgame is the third one, and while I don't hate it as much some do, it does feel a lot more constrained than previous games did.

= The Big Minus 1 =

I removed an entire point off the final score for one reason - compulsory secret hunting. There are hundreds of dice hidden around the world, which give you a *massive* boost to loot luck if you find them all. Which makes it mandatory. And you need to find every single one. 

Oh, and some of them can't even be accessed until you finish the game, so before you get to enjoy the endgame, you'll be spending 6 hours hunting through the world trying to find them. This is another example of the game's smugness - it thinks that you'll bother with this awful, awful idea and not just download someone else's savegame with all of them unlocked.

= Overall =

+ Okay plot that occasionally comes close to making me feel things.
+ One or two jokes land
+ Shooty looty action is as good as always.
+ Can be pretty
+ Voice acting can be decent

- Feels like a step back in some ways
- Mandatory secret hunting is a TERRIBLE idea. Don't do this.
- The conclusion of the story...no, no idea what this game was trying to say.
- Overpriced
- Not amazing performance
- Terrible DLC
- Overabundance of 'identity' characters with zero identity outside of 'I'm trans', 'I'm gay', 'I am attracted to objects', 'I am attracted to animals' etc.
- Fantasy/mythology parodies are so dated and common that there are probably more parody games than just plain old fantasy games now.

At the end of the day, if you're a Borderlands nut...well, you probably bought this on release. For anyone else, it's not as bad as some people are making it out, but - think the Pre-Sequel. It's basically a big DLC/overhaul sold for full AAA prices. Smugly.",1673216917,1673217325,True,13,0,0.611695706844329834,0,True,False,False

Instead of opening up a brave new world of fantasy tropes to lampoon in the typical Borderlands style, Wonderlands presents itself as a completely sincere adaptation. Dual-classing is a cool addition, but the very low level cap sucks the fun out of class building. Level design is beautiful and exciting to explore but encounters are repetitive. Most egregious are the tedious arena battles, which mostly involve standing around waiting for handfuls of enemies to spawn in sad little waves.

In addition to being trite and repetitive, quest dialogue often forces the player to stand around waiting for tedious narration to finish before proceeding to the next objective. And of course the writing overall is ""Young Adult"" in a manner so reductive as to be insulting.

I finished the main campaign and most of the side quests in this game and I cannot recommend this if you care about the Borderlands lore.

It does not add anything to the Borderlands story, is all made up just for the sake of it and it feels lazy, almost like Tiny Tina herself developed the game being a psycho bomb maker teenage girl. 

110% WOKE, they don't try to hide the wokeness at all (This is the only well planned part of this game apart from the graphics unfortunately)

 It is soooooo boring, its not funny at all, and the story is told 98% in joke format.

Some of the game mechanics are boring as well, like the dice and most of the quests being like: Grab 3 of this because, yes, then put it there because I said so, then kill this pathetic boss with no tangible back story because I don't care.

And the weird thing is that the characters talk all the time! They are having full multi paragraph conversations while you are fighting enemies, so if its already hard to pay attention because it is boring AF, imagine trying to pay attention while fighting, I can only assume not important if its going at the same time, the game at least is self conscious of its bad lore.

The game is full of bugs, UI is messy and confusing (good luck trying to figure out DPS or how much critical hit chance you actually have for example), elements vanish from the UI for no reason (restarting the game works sometimes), quests does not work requiring restart and many other bugs, and I got the game 6 months after the release. (1.0.6.0 or something)

The loot sucks, most of the items does not work, its not that the weapons or spells are bad, is just that they not work at all, you die trying to use them, and the other 1/3 are OP, you can blaze through the game one blue weapon in hand the whole time, don't need to worry about elemental damage or any of that on HARD difficulty (check other reviews for more details, can't use snipers or launchers).

Most bosses are weaker than elite or badass enemies, is pathetic.

And it is a shame too because the world and the graphics are gorgeous, its one of the most beautiful games of the franchise.

I am sad for this game, even having paid half price for all the content (Game + Season Pass) I think it was not worth it, maybe 20 bucks for everything? Hard to say, because the game has a lot of content but the content SUUUUUX.

Here is my ranking of the games just for the sake of comparison.

Been playing for a few hours and its about as fun as Borderlands. It pretty much IS borderlands with a D & D skin and story, with Tiny Tina being a dungeon master.

For example when selecting your character - there are a few choices there that you cannot select - because DLC. There is an area you can visit that has a ton of stuff you cannot access - because its DLC.

As a game within a game, Wonderlands has you playing through a simulated tabletop roleplaying campaign called Bunkers and Badasses, a sort of alternate-reality Dungeons and Dragons that replaces generic fantasy tropes with absurdity, gratuitous violence, and tons of guns regardless of whether they’re setting-appropriate or not. But that’s the magic of this larger-than-life looter-shooter RPG, which throws caution to the wind and embraces chaos and nonsense in favor of ludicrous and memorable moments.

Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is a fantastic fantasy take on Borderlands’ tried-and-true looter shooter formula. As spin-offs go, it sticks dangerously close to its past successes which at times felt a bit unoriginal and some of the new stuff it tries, like procedurally generated combat encounters, didn’t pan out terribly well. Luckily, the excellent writing, hilarious performances from an all-star cast, and ridiculous combat continue to shine brightly and make this tabletop-inspired explosion-fest absolutely worth your time.",1673162725,1673162725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u] Including my own opinion/feelings (hehe) [/u]
Okay, there's a lot to unpack here...
I'll start by saying that this review will contain minor spoilers (Nothing story-wise).
[h1]Let's start with the pros:[/h1]
1. [b][u]Class variety[/u][/b] - The class system allows you to choose a class and a sub class. Unique to this game, it adds some nice flair to the gameplay. (We don't get to see any whacky classes like Gaige Anarchy or Jacks Money is Power, which is unfortunate, but each class plays fairly differently, and getting to mix and match is kinda fun)
2. [b][u]Projectile Speed[/u][/b] - The weapons feel great to shoot, and you hardly feel the travel time. 
3. [b][u]Boss fights[/u][/b] - The bosses in this game are a mixed bag. Some of them are very good, with well telegraphed attacks, others just run at you, and some fall in between. I'd say the good bosses are arguably the best in the series. The bad bosses are just, well... Spawn a bandit, give it lots of hp, then call it a boss...

[h1]Now to the cons:[/h1]
1. [b][u]Weapon variety[/u][/b] - Weapon variety has almost never been lower in the borderlands series. 
Shotguns, Snipers, and AR's got completely gutted and are essentially no longer usable, minus a few legendary drops.
Launchers... They may as well not exist at this point, many of them have less damage than snipers, slow you down to a crawl, and just aren't worth it when they do a fraction of what an smg or pistol will do in a couple of shots. (Pistols do almost as much as snipers, just so you have context).
The weapons you used to love (Conference Call, Norfleet, The Twister, Flakker, and other weapons that have fairly unique projectiles) are almost non-existent here. Many of the legendary weapons feel fairly lack lustre.

Speaking of, with a grand total of 46 Legendary+Unique guns, 
Tiny Tina's Wonderlands somehow manages to have less than *Half* the legendary+Unique+Pearls compared to Borderlands 1. That's right, the first Borderlands game.

Now I understand that Borderlands 3 might have had quite the overflow of legendary weapons, but Tiny Tinas seems to have an underflow, with quite a few of the legendary weapons feeling very... Normal. In fact, I would argue many of them are worse than purple and blue tier weapons, thus having the same problem as Borderlands 3, but worse somehow.

2. [b][u]Enemy Spawning[/u][/b] - This could be a positive or a negative, depending on how you play the game, as well as how lucky you are. Sometimes an enemy will just magically spawn behind you (Yes, they just appear, that's how it works in this game). As such, you could be unlucky and have a bomber spawn behind you and blow up. Hence why I mentioned that snipers are almost useless in this game. 

This compounds further into (Skip this if you don't want minor spoilers to end game content)
[spoiler] Chaos Chambers, end game content that's sort of like running a raid? Enemies spawn in a small stage randomly (which means you could get a badass spawn (Or multiple... Right behind your back...)), you kill them, get some upgrades, and continue for 6-8ish stages. There are also some boss fights, where they have adds, and you can suffer from these adds, especially if you are dodging their attacks (you have to jump/duck for quite a few of of them, hindering your ability to get away from adds) [/spoiler]

3. [b][u]Enemy variety[/u][/b] - While there is a good variety, many don't feel fun to fight against. I'll go into detail about how each enemy is and how fun/unfun it is to fight against each.
[spoiler] 
Enemy archetypes include the following:
[b]Skeletons[/b] - The normal shamblers that just run at you are fine, but the mages are high priority targets that can (and will) do a large amount of damage to you. The archers predict your movement from miles away and have a spread shot, so... Well, have fun getting sniped from across the map while fighting a boss. 
[b]Pirates[/b] - Your normal bandits, nothing too bad about these, except that they dodge bullets by jumping to the side, and when you hit a weak point, they instantly stand up again sometimes, which means slow firing weapons are a no-go
[b]Mushrooms[/b] - The bombers suck to fight against, little one-shot monsters that can catch you off guard due to spawning. The mortar mushrooms are annoying since 2-3 of them can dish out a *ton* of damage. The rest are fine for the most part.
[b]Goblins[/b] - Most are fine, but the engineers can leap from a huge distance away and the leap does a ton of damage. The barrel goblins are unnecessarily tanky, and if a bomber is hiding inside the barrel that you just broke, ha ha, skill issue.
[b]Trolls[/b] - These guys are fine. Sucks when they spawn behind you, but they have clear weak points to hit. Just walking HP bars.
[b]Scyllia[/b] - Holy, the most annoying of the annoying. These things slither around at mach 10, huck spears that deal an insane amount of damage (enough to 2 shot quite often). Some carry shields, so you can't hit them with projectile weapons unless you shoot from above (good luck with that). The electric ones will cast large electric fields around where you stand, so you have to be on the move constantly, and if you are unfortunate enough to be in a cycle of 4 of them, you better hope you are fast enough to get out of that circle and kill them fast enough. (They have massive range too) Fast firing spray-and-pray weapons do best against these things.
[b]Wyverns[/b] - These guys are fine. A bit much to handle if you are unlucky and only have slow projectile weapons or low range weapons, but otherwise pretty fun to fight.
[b]Crabs[/b] - The smallest weak points known to man-kind, there are mortar crabs with the same problem as with the mortar mushrooms
 [/spoiler]

4. [b][u]Enemy weak points[/u][/b] - Don't even bother aiming for them. You can hit trolls and some goblins, but forget the rest. From dodging and tiny windows to hit the weak points, you are better off using a high fire-rate weapon to hope you get the crit from the crit chance, and not from weak points. Most bosses also suffer from this. Additionally, with the amount of sporadic movement, dodging, and questionable AI, aiming for crit points with projectile based weapons is near impossible.

5. [b][u]Story[/u][/b] - While not as insufferable as BL3 (usually), this one is not good, and the poor writing mainly falls back on the fact that it's a D&D campaign as an excuse to be bad. I understand that D&D is great with improvisation, but this takes it a few steps too far.  The main villain is aight though. 

6. [b][u]Class variety[/u][/b] - While this was a positive point, it's also a negative point. With quite a few skills being ""Here, have +10% gun damage"" or ""Here, have a bit of move speed"", etc, it means that certain classes just aren't optimal with other subclasses, resulting in what I would argue less variety than BL2. Better than BL3 though, so at least they have that, amirite?

7. [b][u]Max Level[/u][/b] - [spoiler] Max level is only level 40, with badass rank being turned into Diablo 3 Paragon (if you know what that is) [/spoiler]

[h1]Too long, didn't read? Here you go:[/h1]
[b]Shotguns/Snipers/Launchers/ARs are pretty much useless.
Bad spawning leads to tons of AoE spam that you can't dodge.
Bad weapon variety compared to previous titles.
Weak points are a thing of the past (Unless you can predict poor enemy AI causing zigzag and head wiggles) [/b]

Wait like a year for them to fix the bugs and balance issues, then get the game on sale. If they bother to fix the game's many problems, I'll see about updating my review, but right now the game feels like they're using us as beta testers.

Well, here's an update: they're not gonna fix the game's many problems. They did fix the awful drop rates, but they did it by adding way too many chaos trials, and there were too many already.

I will say this, though. [spoiler]Barkenstein[/spoiler], the ""green"" raid boss, is an amazing boss. I've told my friends that it's ""to Borderlands what the Empress of Light is to Terraria"", and what that means is that the boss has very fun mechanics that feel rewarding and make getting defeated by the boss feel legitimate, unlike other bosses who can feel too easy or, more likely, unfair. It's a shame such a great boss is embedded in a game that still, to this day, just feels like Gearbox aimed for making money over making a quality product.

I played this game in Epic's store for the first year and have around 300 hours logged. So yeah... I like it. 

I'm a sucker for these titles, and have loved playing them since the first Borderlands back in the late 2000's. If you enjoy the looter/shooter genre and don't mind RNG taken to the next level, you will enjoy this game. 

The story line is fun, and similar to the first Bunkers & Badasses release in Borderlands 2. Gearbox does a great job balancing the traditional table top D&D RPG with the standard BL overlay. Here are some pros and cons. 

PROs
- Gun play is tight and fast. (BL has always been a good shooter.)
- There are a million version of loot which make replaying reqarding.
- Story line is ineresting and funny with Will Arnett voicing the bad guy (and killing it). 
- Voice actors are really great and keep the story engaging.
- Maps are varied and enemies are fun.
- DLC keeps the game interesting.

CONs
- While I love Ashley Burch (Tiny Tina), her voice gets kinda grating. 
- The entire story line is a little short for a AAA game. 
- The game is kind of ""One-Note"", meaning it does shooting and story line well, but that's about it. 
- The potty humor gets a little much and it feels like the writers rely on it a little too much. 

TBH - If you like BL games, then this one will satisfy.",1672887004,1672887257,True,5,0,0.567816019058227539,0,True,False,False

I don't think anyone would be confused by the fact that this game isn't called ""Borderlands"", but just to be extra sure: yes, this is most definitely a Borderlands game. It has the same basic gameplay, the same structure, the same kind of story, the same brand of humor. The only real differences are that the player characters aren't *actual* characters anymore and are instead fully customizable, that there are no vehicles, the grenades are replaced with magic spells, and there are now different melee weapons and ""armor"". Otherwise it's pretty much the same game.

It doesn't even look all that different visually: despite being fantasy, it still has the same not-quite-cel-shaded appearance, you mostly pick up guns that look almost exactly the same as in other entries to the series (except some of them now have bow parts), and you fight some very familiar-looking and behaving enemies (though in the interest of fairness there are some fresh-ish additions).

Since I doubt that a lot of people would expect anything from the story of this game, I'll be brief: the story is a mess. The writers try to go for something meta with the villain, include banter between both the characters in the Borderlands setting and the in-universe Wonderlands setting, and have some fun in the process with the D&D-type setting, but stumbled on pretty much every step to the point that even stuff that you'd think would be basic is unclear. If the ""Newbie"", i.e., your character, is playing with two other people, where are their characters in-game? Why do they keep talking as if they have any impact on the events? And if they do, why would the villain never address them? What was the villain's plan, anyway? None of this would really be clear by the end.

One more thing that is related to writing before I move on: the jokes in this entry make my soul shrivel and die every time. They're the most shallow, often hopelessly outdated kind of referential humor, only sometimes connected with the premise of the game. It often feels like a Friedberg and Seltzer type of movie, not helped by the fact that at least one of the ""jokes"" in this game actually did appear in the infamous Epic Movie (2007).

In terms of gameplay, at least at the time of this review the game feels incredibly unpolished, even compared to the other games in the series. The maps can be hard to navigate (some are three-dimensional, and one has portals to complicate matters even further) and have a lot of invisible walls and odd level geometry, there are some pretty serious buggy interactions between items and skills, etc.

Perhaps the biggest issue with the gameplay, however, is the wildly inconsistent difficulty. With the exception of one particular boss, every boss fight in this game was a complete joke, some not even managing to finish their introductory monologue before getting killed. Even the final boss barely lasted two minutes. Meanwhile, battles with normal enemies can be anything from a breeze to a chore to a complete nightmare depending solely on which types of enemies you're fighting and seemingly no other reason.

Most of all, this game feels lazy. The credit sequence starts with an apology that the development was difficult due to COVID, but I don't think that can explain every problem this game ended up having and every choice that was made. About half the gameplay is done in the form of ""Encounters"", fights with enemies spawning out of thin air with no real explanation or reason in small combat arenas (that are repeated for each of the four main areas of the overworld map). The DLC follows the same structure, but even the main game isn't all that much better: one tiny, but illustrative example is that the levels are full of impassable black voids out of which the enemies arrive, when the previous games in the series usually at least had put enough care into this to put doors or something like that there. And this kind of laziness is felt throughout everything.

All in all, I would only recommend this if you're really, REALLY jonesing for more Borderlands, no matter the quality.",1672874162,1672874162,False,4,0,0.525113880634307861,0,True,False,False

- As usual, 90% of gear is completely pointless, you'll find a single weapon that you use for 10 - 20 levels.

There's some good of course :
-The environments are really nice. They're colorful, varied, and detailed. Fantasy locations look quite good with the serie's cell-shaded style, and it's a welcome change of pace from the usual bleakness of the mainline games.
-The game lets you pick any two classes (out of 7, one of which is DLC), allowing for a bunch of combinations.
-The ""fantasy"" weapon variants are nice and an interesting twist on typical weapons (typical weapons are still there though, don't worry).
-Story is alright. Nothing groundbreaking, but just alright. (Although after Borderlands 3 my standards are admittedly very, very low.)
-Grenades have been replaced with cooldown based spells, which have a variety of cool effects and go a long way to sell the fantasy theme.
-The bosses are cool and more interactive than just ""stand there and shoot until the health bar is empty"".
-And overall the gunplay is nice and tight.

But there's a lot more bad overall :
-While you can multiclass, each class only has a single skill tree. So you'll only have two skill trees in the end, which may or may not synergize. You also can't reroll your secondary class until you finish the game, and you can never reroll your main class.

-The level cap is very low (40). You get a bit more skillpoints than that (44 total), but it's still low. You can't even get both of your capstones. And unlike the other games in the serie, no DLC increases it.

-To ""compensate"" the low cap, from level 40 onward you get ""mythic levels"" which are incredibly minor bonuses in lieu of proper skillpoints. Gain a level, get +1% reload speed! Can you FEEL the progression? It blows.

-The game is short. My playtime upon finishing is at 37 hours, and that's with a lot of idling, doing nearly every side quest, and just generally taking my sweet time.

-The humour is tired. Sure, a couple of jokes got me smiling, but when the entire game is a never ending avalanche of corny jokes, puns, and pop culture references, obviously one or two are going to land. But the vast majority did not.

-Claptrap is there. Mercifully, his appearances are brief and limited to sidequests.

-There are a few bugs. Nothing gamebreaking, but definitely some annoyances, like a pickup prompt not going away or menus not scrolling properly.

-You can now loot and equip melee weapon. Which means instead of melee scaling automatically and increasing in effectiveness with some characters' skills, now it's yet another equipment that'll become obsolete after an hour and a half. Yet another category diluting the loot pool. Yet another chance to get a legendary you don't give a damn about (because no, melee combat isn't good enough to build a character around, so it remains a gimmick).

-Most dungeons, ""random encounters"", and a majority of sidequests are just basic arena fights where the game plops you into a randomly selected map, throws a couple of small waves of enemies at you then calls it a day. It's a very lazy way to make content and blatant padding. It's boring (especially since the maps are somewhat big and enemies spawn sparsely and often far from you, so you regularly get gaps in the action), it's uninspired, the rewards are lousy, and you'll be sick of them by the time you've done your third one.

-There is now a luck stat, which you increase by finding random dice hidden in the maps. Fitting in theory, but in practice it means you'll mostly drop worthless trash for a good half of the game, until you've found enough dice to prop up your luck - at which point you'll start dropping thing like a normal Borderlands game. It also means you are punished if you don't take the time to explore the map and find at least a good portion of the dice in each one.

-Those arena fights I mentionned? That's THE ENTIRETY OF THE POST GAME CONTENT. Yep, instead of getting some new sidequests, raid boss, or even a harder new game+ like usual, you just get a bunch of lousy arena fights with some half-assed modifiers thrown on top. After completing a ""chaos run"" (that's what they call it), you get a bunch of loot, which you can then use to... do more chaos runs, I guess. Because there is NOTHING else to do.

So... yeah. ""Meh"" indeed. Pick the game up on a deep sale, play a bit until you've had your fill, then just move on to something better and forget about this one.",1672665966,1672665966,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Very refreshing is the addition of dual classing, with the ability to change that dual class once you have completed the main story.

It has the traditional borderlands style graphics, looting, elemental and different rarity guns with a new twist; a DnD-style narrative where Tiny Tina is the DM and you are just a player that has set out to take on the quests in Tina's tabletop map with your friends. 

The one thing that keeps catching me off-guard though are the environmental graphics, they look reallly good for a 'borderlands' game. At times the game feels reminiscent of Skyrim in the sense that you may enter a dungeon in search of some artifact on a quest, and will be fighting skeleton warriors along the way.

With the introduction of spells slinging, this game affords you the flexibility to play it as you wish. I wasn't used to using the spells at first, so I kept forgetting about them, and the game resembled a more traditional borderlands experience with gun-based and melee weapon play, but as I began facing tougher enemies, using those spells has been instrumental to not only conserving ammo but to take on swarms",1672585259,1672585259,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Wonderlands to Borderlands 3 feels like Pre-Sequel to Borderlands 2 - the same engine and formula, but with a bunch of new ideas and experiments in gameplay. Class combinations, the new equipment slots (melee weapon and rings), a new element (Dark Magic), spells instead of grenades, and character stats like Loot Luck or Class Power make the game fresh and fun. I hope some of the ideas we will see in Borderlands 4.

The locations, story, side quests, and loot are all gorgeous. Every part of the game is as good (if not better) as Borderlands 3. Humor and story are not for everyone, but it holds classic Borderlands style, so you either like it or not.

It has a rather lovely endgame. It's different from Borderlands, but it's a nice switch and way better than replaying the game three times to get to max level.

However, it makes more sense in Wonderlands to try more classes and play the game multiple times from level 1 compared to Borderlands instead of maxing the same character. Quests and enemies here scale to your level from the beginning, and the class system is done in a way that makes sense to play the game ""horizontally"" instead of vertically. Much of the content was put into variations and RPG elements, so trying many classes and their combinations will be more fun than just making a single class throughout the game.

Season Pass is often blamed for lack of content, and indeed there are no full-story DLCs like in Borderlands, but it is what it is. Could the game be expanded even more? Yes. Is it great and full of fun gameplay for 50-100+ hours as it is? Also yes.

Voice Actors / Dialogue: I snorted at most of the lines and the voice actor for Ribula and Tiny Tina is amazing and I know for a fact the voice actors had fun recording their lines.

Story: I only got to see the beginning of the game but I was really digging the story and the overall DND representation and references.

Character Customisation: The beginning you do get quite a bit of customisation, you get maybe 10 different versions per body part but would have loved to see A LOT more colour options or even a colour wheel would have been cool considering how vibrant the environment is.

Attacks: Loved the idea you get to pick a Class but there was not a lot, maybe 5 or 6. As for the Melee I wish there was more than just pressing a single button. Would have loved to see combos.

- Classes and skill trees

- Graphics are beautiful

It's basically a glorified arcady wave shooter with every level and area looking and feeling the same. It's also poorly optimized with constant frame rate drops almost every time it auto-saves, which is like every few seconds. The game also would often freeze as the frame rate dived into the 30's, possibly due to Denuvo. Vsync also does not save and has to be re-enabled every time you start the game. I also found the inventory system to be uninteresting and confusing. Ammo, loot, and weapons also fly out of enemies and chests like crazy and these items get scattered everywhere to the point that I just started ignoring them. Changing weapons didn't seem to matter anyway and there's no cool ways to really improve armor. There's also lots of gun sway with every shot that I didn't care for.

In this game, you spend most of your time organizing piles of gear with minuscule stat buffs, fighting  the RNG that insists on giving ""good"" gear  which counteracts my entire build. The  game  also gives you ""bonus"" skin unlocks which are  level locked  to a higher level, and will not let me put them in the bank, leading to me having  4 of my 36 inventory slots permanently filled with unusable items.

The world feels absolutely  dead, compounded by the fact that even on Public nobody ever joins my session, so walking through a world populated by static ""NPCs"" who do  not react at all to anything (not even the perma-crouch response to gunfire from BL2/BL3) is  the norm. Even quest givers, who would comment on you not going to the objective  in every other BL game, is absent, leading to long sections of no dialog or environmental feedback at all. Items aren't destructible, nothing moves, the  world feels more like  a  backdrop than a place  the  characters can inhabit, and is a huge  leap backwards in world building and player engagement.

What makes it all the more infuriating is that it is impossible to have a  stable build in any domain at any time. Want to get a new gun, well now your spells are less effective. Want to get a buff in spell time, then take a major hit somewhere else. This wouldn't be  bad if all abilities were item-based, or if the buffs were big enough to make the debuffs palatable, but since most of the abilities are tied to specific stats, then there are massive piles of gear that look decent but will make the player a lot less capable.

The voice acting is OK, but there is  zero engagement to let us know who the new characters are, why they are stuck here beyond ""ship crashed"", or why I  should care about them,. Absolutely none of the  NPCs so  far have been interesting or fun, instead going for funny accents in place of writing that would give them a soul, and even Will Arnett  cannot make the villain more than a cardboard cutout with the dialog and story that he was given.

This is  such a letdown, BL1 was good,  2 was great, BLPS and TFB were good again, 3 was passable, and  now this is.... worse than even the BL3 DLC.  It's a  stain on Tiny Tina's name that so much potential for a game like  this has been flushed down the toilet of mediocrity that Gearbox seems to inhabit  these days, and as a huge fan of the series it's just terribly sad to see how far the  series has fallen in 10 years.",1672514831,1672514831,False,11,0,0.592258274555206299,0,True,False,False

To me this feels like a modern crossover between the classic look and feel of a top down RPG complete with instances and event locations which lead into the classic fps/tps loot shooter.  The monsters/enemies are typical for BL behavior and voices but the skins and abilities are new and original and takes place in a total fantasy based world.

So comparing it to BL3, game runs a lot better, classes are more to my liking, and i quite enjoy the variety of spells replacing grenades.

Melee is a mixed bag for me because while it's great that they're now a whole new weapon type, hitting shit lacks a lot of impact.

Humor is just as fine, even with all the censorship, starts very dull, gets a lot better around the moment where Torgue shows up, it's still the same dumb shit you're used to. So unless you're a giant man-child ironically obsessed with trying to be ''mature'' you'll enjoy it just fine.

On the censorship though, and this is probably what kills the vibe the most for me, is the lack of gore... or not the lack of /gore/ itself but more about the lack of explosiveness that BL3 had, where you could make a dude explode with overkill damage, or dismember them. I feel they should've at least added it on a toggle, enemies still explode through overkill but it seems to be a lot more rare than usual, and it doesn't feel as satisfying as it is in BL3.

Its Borderlands except in a D&D setting. It has the best character customization of all the Borderlands games, and the combat is the best as well.  There are many interesting guns, but I ended up beating the game with a sub-machine gun I got at level 11 because it worked so well with my character's build. The story is decent, but not all of the jokes landed for me. 

The game is overpriced for what you get. If you rush, you can beat the main story in maybe only a few hours. I beat it at around 18 hour playtime around level 30 (the max is 40); that is, I beat it at the highest difficulty, completed over twenty side quests, several dungeon runs, and a few chaos chamber runs. The DLC adds optional dungeons which are too easy and not worth doing. Other end game content like the Chaos Chamber also seems pointless to me. Why grind for loot when you've beaten the game and have nothing overly difficult to fight? Now if they added difficult, mechanically complex bosses to fight maybe you could justify paying full price.

All that being said, I recommend the game IF AND ONLY IF you can get it on sale. The gameplay is good, the story is decent, but too short, and it lacks meaningful end game content.",1672356879,1672357189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was never a huge fan of the Borderlands series, or even the looter-shooter genre to begin with, but this game really caught my attention and I decided to try it out. Firstly, I have to say the writing in this game is hilarious. Although it has it's cringe moments (like all video games), I found myself laughing to the witty, yet dumb punch lines it provides. The voice acting really elevates the writing and helps on the delivery of most jokes. There was plenty of satire, sarcasm, and overall witty remarks which i really loved.
The game play is actually super fun. As I mentioned earlier, I never really liked looter-shooter games too much, but I found myself actively enjoying the hunt for new weapons and gear. Trying out a massive variety of weapons and spells and finding something that suits my play style was super enjoyable. The amount of variety in this game is truly amazing, not just in weapons and spells, but it also surprised me how many different enemy types there were. Blasting through hoards and waves of different enemies was my favorite part about the game.
Lastly, the artwork, graphics, and design of the game really blew me away. The game is truly beautiful. There are plenty of different areas and sections you can explore in the game and they surprised me with how great they all looked. There were lots of bright, vibrant, and colorful areas, mixed in with darker, dreary, and dungeon-like settings creating what seems like a perfect balance between light and dark. Truly a unique game and i can't recommend it enough if you're looking for something new to sink your teeth into. 9/10 overall rating and would 100% recommend to a friend.",1672189914,1672189914,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The comedy side of things is kinda fun, the gameplay left a lot to be desired however.

I've around 10 minutes experience of Borderlands on the xbox 360, I seem to think other games were available at the time that dragged my interest away so I never really gave it a go. Not wanting to miss my refund window I turned this one off after 90 mins never to return again.

Some people may like the Fortnite style games, if they do then it could be worth a try I guess (I don't know what would make a good fortnite style game since inmy opinion it's boring).

The good: the character creation is SUPER great and I really appreciated the inclusiveness and lack of gender-bound options. So many COOL options for classes, this is one of the few games where I spent nearly as much time agonizing over class choice as nailing the exact right slider for every single one of my cosmetic choices (mushroom bro! plague bringing! THE AGONY OF CHOICE). Loading up a co-op game was also very smooth with no problems. What little I've reached of the story and characters involved is hilarious and wonderful, and really loads up on the nostalgia for previous borderlands games. Having the different types of maps and game play is weird but cool, it breaks things up a little and makes the game unique, it's a plus for me but I can see why others might not like the overworld map when all they wanted was a shooter.

Some bad: I don't usually have problems with motion sickness during games but after playing for just a few minutes it gave me a wicked bad headache that lasted for hours. After consulting the almighty google I changed a BUNCH of different settings and to its credit, I have no discomfort now. Half of these settings I never would've been able to find on my own, however (in case you need it, the big ones for me were in accessibility and concerned turning of ALL camera motion/bobbing and then in gameplay to center the reticule. Higher field of view nice, but not as impactful). Consulting google was a constant since encountering a game-hindering/breaking bug was a very common occurrence and fully half of the initial few hours of gameplay was just making it playable. Not ideal.

In conclusion: at full price, especially for the chaotic edition, I would be pretty upset with how buggy it is. Having bought it at a significant discount, I'm feeling pretty good about things.

It feels like a perfected, yet condensed Borderlands experience. It's the gameplay that I've always wanted from this series. I think I'm on my fifth or sixth playthrough as of writing this. Haven't played online, never played any game online in my life, but I am intrigued by it for the first time, like I could see this being my first online game. I'm committed to the Borderlands series, which makes this great for me, but I guess this would be pretty unappealing to someone who hadn't at least played Borderlands 2. That's as close as I can get to an honest criticism here. Okay well a lot of the humor is still cringe, half of everything is a reference to something else. Torgue is funnier than a thousand Star Wars lines. Tina is more likable than any amount of nerd cred that can be harvested from nostalgic movie quotes. The three new main characters, all voiced by legitimately famous, legitimately funny people are enough to keep me entertained, I don't need them to be parodies of characters from other IPs. What I'm saying is that Gearbox is at their funniest when they are telling their own jokes. I think they limit their potential for writing and worldbuilding when they fill in the blanks with referential humor. Borderlands 3 was honestly taxing with all that Reddit type humor thrown in, it made the game feel dated on release day. Borderlands has the funnest gameplay of any game I've ever played, I have no notes on the gameplay, and I'll buy the next game because the gameplay will certainly smack. The writing and worldbuilding are on par with the gameplay, they just just need to drop the reference humor and realize that they are totally capable of being funny and engaging on their own merit.",1671938858,1671938858,True,37,1,0.667938768863677979,0,True,False,False

If you go in with reasonable expectations (I believe I did) then its pretty fun. 

The gameplay is actually pretty engaging, it starts off kind of slow as expected but quickly picks up. The class progression is nice and the skills seem meaningful, giving substantial bonuses (at least the classes I chose). In previous games some skills didn't feel like they did much besides have a place in the tree. I like the stat allocation system as well, I think this should be brought back in the future. 

The loot dice are a good system and overall I enjoyed the collectibles, they were placed in fun and creative ways where it felt rewarding to explore and not as if were just aimlessly running around until you spotted one. 

Something I thought was great was they didn't build the game around being replayed a few times. You finish the game at max level. It feels less tedious and not as boring when you aren't doing the same quests multiple times.

The overworld JRPG system was kind of cool, it works well for this game but I'm not sure about for future BORDERLANDS games. I did like vehicles in previous games but they were also kind of a hassle. The JRPG system made it so maps were more compact, it felt better designed and meaningful. I think borderlands wouldn't be the same without vehicles but wonderlands does a good job without them. The fast travel system was GREAT, being able to fast travel from anywhere is amazing and should be in all borderlands games to come.

I liked the chaos chamber, its a good endgame system to get good loot and expands well on the arenas you find in the overworld. I do think they should make it more roguelike-like, the replayability wasn't amazing. I hope they bring it back and improve upon it in the future.

I knew the writing was gonna be kinda bad but I was a little surprised that it was just mediocre and not BAD. The voice acting is okay, I ended up turning off dialogue and listening to music instead. There's a little too much dialogue that you have to wait for, which is kind of expected from the borderlands series at this point but I wish they added the skip dialogue by line feature from cyberpunk. The overall story was decent as well, I liked the ending but was kind of bored of it halfway through. Kind of felt like they just stitched the beginning and end together. 

I will say I bought the chaotic great edition (the one that includes the season pass) and I don't think the DLC is worth it unless you get it for the discounted price, and even then its not that great. The only thing going for it is a few new areas to explore that aren't very different from those in the base game besides aesthetic. They are more like long side quests than actual DLC. The class that you get from the DLC is fun but otherwise I'd save your money.

Main campaign and side quests are not rewardable at all! We found only two legendary items for the whole entire campaign, and they were dropped by enemies. Developed by geniuses, they did not push anything worthwhile. So, we reached the end and realized that there was no frgn worthwhile! Even skull keys mostly give trash. 

[i](Yeah, I know about Luck value, but you have to do boring collectibles to increase it)[/i] 

BL3 has good balanced gameplay and grind formula. After BF3, it's a big step back! I met several interesting guns but it's too small amount after BL3

I thought cars in BL were annoying, but map travel is more trash. Especially the dumbest idea to spawn enemies in bushes which starts annoying encounters! Developers thought that huge empty levels is not enough?

New classes and abilities add some  new fresh gameplay variations. Especially I liked to play as Spell Caster. However, on the 5-th chaos level I had to change it to Grave Born. Not sure about other classes but this one has most survivable abilities. I bet, other classes have balance problems too. 

[i](Well, probably my build was bad)[/i]
 
Side missions for blue / pink weapons is sad. We truly tried to get an achievement for all side quests but each time one of us or both just falls asleep after 30 minutes of the game. And those missions are wait for dialog, wait for NPC, wait for dialog, destroy something. You can’t skip any dialogs; you must wait. Yeah, some of them are funny, but in general I can’t remember any of them.

Why do you need levels thing in the game? All enemies auto levels to yours level or plus several levels (depends on chaos). I want to return back after final boss and beat all sheet out of annoying goblins [i](okay, it's my problem)[/i]

Badass rank is changed again, and now you must waste skills to each of four trees. But I don’t like melee weapons in the game. Why do I need to waste my points?!

The brightest moment in the game is Chaos Room. Here you can be finally rewarded by something worth or interesting. It's challenging and you can set up dungeon attempt. Without pooping dialogs to my ears; just you and clear grind gameplay. But then again, best items in vending machines costs too much at the end of the attemption. So, you must grind and sell junk again. It feels like you were scammed like a mammoth.

I guess, worthy only with a discount.

That kept happening during a few cutscenes and I do not know why. Brought my GPU memory usage up to 18,6gb. In case someone else runs into this: I could not get past the cutscene of the final boss until i changed over to DirectX 11. That maxed out my GPU (a 3090. wtf is going on?), but at least it worked. I just switched back after the cutscene.

But that aside, the game is actually a lot of fun overall. It's got a lot of unused potential. It is overall a good game, but it could be a great game.

HOWEVER it is a game ruined by corporate greed, yet again. Just sucks to see that happen. The game feels pretty rushed in a bunch of places. But the absolute kick in the butt is a quest you get at the very beginning of the game. It introduces you to a nice mechanic that you can use to get really nice loot... only to then find out that the only way to make use of it is by buying the DLCs. ""Oh, so you paid full price for this game? Well just look at what amazing stuff you are missing out on by not giving us even MORE money"". They genuinely made the game less enjoyable just so you can give them more money... for a 60€ game... 

If you love the Borderlands looter-shooter gameplay and TTRPGs such as DND, you will probably like this game, even with its many of bugs. But when a company actively goes out of their way to take away the fun of a game just so they can ask for more money to get it back, I just can not give a good review.

I do hope there will be another spinoff like that that actually doesn't just have guns (melee as a better option, bows, crossbows, maybe throwing weapons and stuff like that), which isn't rushed and ISNT turned into a cash-grab. Though Borderlands doesn't seem to be on a good path, looking at the DLC of BL3 and this game.

I'd rank Borderlands 2 as one of my top 20 favorite video games ever.  I was heavily invested in the Tales from the Borderlands game.  Thought it was a great piece of storytelling that really tied into the plot of the series.  Borderlands: The Presequel was... not as good.  I didn't like the zero gravity or low gravity mechanics.  I was less interested in the backstory plot of the game.  It was the first Borderlands game I didn't finish, though I could be convinced to sit down and play through it again.  Borderlands 3 was a step in the right direction, but the planet hopping wasn't as fun as just staying on Pandora.  I didn't like where they took a few of the characters.  But I still beat it and then started a replay through it, as I did enjoy it for the most part.

And I'm a fan of tabletop RPGs.  I played DnD for close to 25 years, ever since I was 14.  This should have all the elements I like in a game.  More equipment.  More abilities.  Customization.  A fantasy theme along with the Borderlands humor.

But it lacked the plot and characters from previous Borderlands games.  It didn't feel like a part of the series, and I hadn't realized how much I needed that.  I didn't like the overmap.  I didn't like the fake fantasy world, or the weird explanation for why there was three people sitting around the table but only one ""player"".  I hated random encounters.  And, good lord, they really bought into the whole PC thing, with pronouns and an over-the-top dose of the gay.  They had some of this in previous games, but they double downed here.  Tells me a lot about Tina.

So finally, I got bored sliding around maps, blasting skeletons and goblins with slightly less interesting guns but slightly more interesting abilities.  Nothing in the plot made me want to keep playing.  Apparently I'm throwing in the towel for this game in less than 10 hours.  In all honesty, I could restart Borderlands 2 for the 12th time and put 50 hours into that game, but I just have no desire to continue with Tiny Tina's Wonderlands.

With that said, I wouldn't go much beyond that for an explanation if you have prior exposure. Beyond adding melee weapons, rings, and spell slots (grenades), everything else is consistent for better or worse. 

The theme is the major sell here, and with a brief understand of Dungeon and Dragons, it does suit it well. There are no vehicles this time around, but rather a over world to which the character moves across with the appearance of a board game. While this matches the theme, it doesn't change anything beyond aesthetic as the story progresses appropriately and with guidance.

When it comes down to much of the game, because it is D&D themed, most is just designed to match. Instead of characters, you have slight customization with a blank slate character, and classes to choose from. With that said, while the plot works around the ""insert character here"" theme, the engagement and characters are not as built.

Also to be noted, that classes have skill tree, and while you can ""dual class"" to unlock more build ideas and potentially more pets, it does feel a tad underwhelming. 

Further playing into this was items that almost felt unnecessary (rings)/melee weapons. These just played into the idea for more things to grind for, but no substance. And while this is a ""fantasy"" world, much of the enemies were re-skinned, and the same guns/mechanics existed. While understanding borderlands was themed around guns and the combinations therein, the new spell introduction which replaced grenades, seemed more appropriate and innovative. 

The environments had the sword and shield, bows, etc, but at most the character had a ""crossbow"" machine gun. The game would have benefited greater if the emphasis was greater with melee weapons, and removed guns, outside of musket esque items, and replaced them with bow variations, slingshots, etc. This is of course my opinion, but does shine on some greater things the game has.

The environments are far more diverse and engaging than in the past, and the universe and theme aloud for it. As stated before, while the universe built was great, some slight alterations that could have been designed would have greatly made the game more engaging or unique.

In simplicity, if you ever wanted to shoot guns at dragons, to then loot more guns this is your game. Outside the realm of that, I would recommend other titles in Borderlands if you haven't already played before this.

Coming strong from Gearbox's previous title - Borderlands 3, I had a huge expectations for this game, yet all it led to was disappointment and a very sour taste left in my mouth. Weak characters, weak writing, weak acting. The story was something I was more than hyped for, especially leading from Tiny Tina's Assault On Dragon Keep yet it just felt like an unmotivated linear mess. I pretty much got through the entire (VERY  SHORT) main story only needing change my weapon twice lmao. The worst part for me was the DLC though, the fact they thought it was even slightly acceptable to charge the regular price of their additional content for 4 pointless, micro-mob rooms which leads to a boss fight is a joke. Did they forget to add the rest of the files or something?

On it's own, it stands fine, but I wouldn't buy it for 60+ bucks. It's Borderlands 2 with 3 and Presequel's mechanics, which I don't have a problem with. I've had a lot of fun with it, and it's likely because of the superb writing and art direction, I also appreciate the pronouns inclusion, be it limited. 

That being said, the Dragon Lord is such a good villain bc gearbox followed the Handsome Jack formula. He just never shuts up and his voice actor is hilarious and has great range (It's Bojack Horseman) so of course he feels thought out and has clear motivations, just like Handsome Jack did. The bosses have all been fun, and I mean that they are not only interesting mechanics wise, but also engaging. They all feel like they have a puzzle you have to solve while beating them to succeed, and even on normal I can say that the game is definitely challenging. 

The guns are cooler than ever and the gunplay is more engaging - I actually had to choose when I wanted to take cover or run, I built up melee not as a last resort but as the choice I wanted to use most of the time in close combat, and then the weapons, abilities, and classes compliment each other so you really feel like you're pulling off awesome DND combos on the spot. 

The characters aren't necessarily likable in this one, but they are entertaining and the themes of the main story and side quests are particularly progressive, though they do miss the mark often (Tiny Tina still talks with a little bit of blaccent, but one of the side quests told by her is all about communist revolution. IDK things like that show a disconnect between the game's goals and execution). 

Overall, no DLC, 10 hours in, I can say I'd buy this on sale for $30-$35 bucks, but not 60, and DO NOT BUY THE DLC THEY ARE AWFUL, YOU GET 6 CLASSES STARTING OFF AND THE DEVS ARENT INCREASING THE LEVEL CAPS, YOU DONT NEED THE DLC.

Seen it done before, better, ab 6 years ago, and it feels much more like an extension to Borderlands 2's Tiny Tina DLC, but it is fun, the characters grow on you, and I'm loving how these new games look and feel to play. Would've been a 6 but the accessibility options and pronouns make it a 7 for me. Only the queer folks know how rare they are even now. I feel about this how I felt about Borderlands 3, it's fun, it's new, and it's engaging, but after I'm done with it, I'm done with it. 7/10.

Edit: After 40 hours and 40+ levels, I can say that this is one of my favorite entries to the series. I thought the story would've been more meta, but it was just a feel good, simple, lighthearted adventure about the trials and tribulations of early Game Mastering, which is just up my alley. The guns and weapons keep getting cooler, and Chaos Mode makes it for me because the options to customize your RNG like a roguelike is something this series has never done before, and it works so incredibly well. The enemies get cooler in Chaos Mode, the bosses were all incredible, the characters are interesting and understandable, the set pieces and level designs were all outstanding, GIVE IT A PLAY!

Yeah the DLC shit sucks, but it is COMPLETELY optional stuff, they even gave the DLC its own area way apart from the rest of the game, to the point that it's never even mentioned, you have to find the DLC to play it (DONT).

40 hrs in, Im gonna keep playing. It's a lot more engaged than I thought. The Live Service model of all games has eaten at it a bit and saved the best until after the final boss, but hey, it's still a Borderlands title and works almost just as well.

FInal Thoughts: BL1 was Skyrim with guns, hard as nails, and couldnt keep my attention, but the characters and story kept me playing. BL2 was a thrill ride where every story mattered and where I wanted to find every secret and play every side mission, and every reward contributed to the main quest. BLtPS was a fun ride across the main games' lore, a bit unbalanced and the setting was rather dreary and it took itself a bit seriously at times, but I had fun with it. BLtPS was the first attempt at a live service model, so you can imagine how that went. TFtBL was interesting and weird, and I liked that. BL3 was some of the best gameplay the series had at the time and I continue to come back to it despite its rushed and awful story direction. 

TTWL is a culmination of all of these games and the shadows that loom over them. Gearbox's heart and soul went into this one, they listened to the fans, and it seems like the new direction this world is going is about taking the time to give the players the most options possible while exploring a well thought out story, no matter what happened in previous games - and while this game still lives in the shadow of 2 and the presequel, it stands on its own regardless and I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with it. 

At the end of the game the devs put a thank you note to the players that details how and why TTWL is the way it is and what direction they are taking moving forward, and I'd just like to thank the devs for all their continued hard work and dedication to one of my favorite series of all time, and for taking the time to make their games the best they can. 

In conclusion, the real villain is corporate greed, crunch culture, and live service models. I hope one day we see more games like Tiny Tina's Wonderlands without the terrible DLC and maybe with the Chaos Mode before the end of the game, but until then, this is the best we got.

Positives
•	The story line is fun as hell
•	The over world stuff fits with the game
•	The weapons are actually kind of cool
•	The puzzle tasks and hunt an item thing works for me 
•	The dual tree system makes it fun
•	And for once the abilities don’t get overpowered by the level (See negative one as to the reason for this)
Sadly this is where it ends
Negatives
•	There is no extra levels for the expansions so they serve no purpose
•	The raids are repetitive at best
•	Raid serves no purpose
•	Even with a party of 4 your kind of no better off
In summary worth the core game price but not worth the £80 I paid for the full content I could have got 2 or 3 better games and more bang for my buck. BUT for fans of Tina worth it for the story alone.

I vote no for this for one and only one reason we all had big hope this could be a big stand alone but sadly feels like a expansion on BL3.

The negativity surrounding the base game is unwarranted. Though I will admit, many of the jokes are niche and very slanted towards the table-top rpg theme... of the whole game... so it's warranted. And, I particularly think that is awesome. But, I've played quite a few rpg's across table-top's, on consoles and PC's. I'm biased towards the rpg jokes and theme.

But, this game is 100% not an rpg. If you know a Borderlands game, you understand the gameplay for the shiny, phat lewt-fest that it is. It's like great cheese melted over a huge awesome FPS burrito. Because even for the grindy FPS that it blatantly is, this game is phenomenally enjoyable.

And... can I just say that Wanda Sykes is the best! I have seen this lady be funny before, but hearing her running commentary through the whole game is fantastic. I makes me want to replay it just for her lines... and Tina. But, seriously... IF you are like who? Then pull up a stand up special... or her just talking sh$t. That woman is hysterical, and one of the best comedians working today.

So, get this game for the gameplay... yes. If you like FPS fun. But, really you should get it for the running commentary, situations and humor. 

I mean it... STOP PLAYING GAMES FOR A FEW and GO WATCH SOME WANDA SYKES STAND-UP!

[h1] The Great [/h1]

+Enemy variety. Instead of the usual reskins that you get with enemies, they have separate attack types and formations, as well as weaknesses. Multiple enemies have stacked health bars, requiring some strategy to dispatch. A zombie for example, has a fleshy shell weak to fire, but once it burns away only the brittle skeleton remains, weak to cyro. Love the new bone
health type as well, always good to have more variety.

++Loot. Luck can be increased passively by finding ""Lucky Dice"" throughout the world. This is a great addition that encourages exploration of the mostly open areas. Drop rates have gone back to the Borderlands 1 ways, where legendaries are still pretty rare, but you will see a couple during the journey.

+++Scaling. My want for every single Borderlands game has been achieved, enemies and missions scale with your character, meaning the challenge remains the same throughout the playthrough. Doing side quests are still required to stay up to the level requirements of new areas, though.

+Environments. All the levels across the board were enjoyed equally, all great. Only minor complaint is not enough store locations to sell off my hordes of garbage..

+Music. The entire soundtrack was a joy to listen to.

+Valentine. Loved his dialog.

+Character cosmetic customization. Tons of variety and inclusive options available.

[h1] The Good [/h1]

+-The Overworld. Has potential to become something great, but feels limited at times. I enjoy returning to earlier areas to unlock shortcuts, but it leaves me wanting more. Inclusion of actual hidden areas like Super Mario World would be a fantastic addition. The random encounters and dungeons can get repetitive with repeating maps too, though they're optional. Would like more camera adjustment as well.

+-Side quests. While some were wonderfully written and actually made me feel emotional, a lot turned into fetch quests.

+-Magic. Spells replaced grenade mods, and I do enjoy them more than grenades. That said, I felt most were inferior to any that had projectile multipliers. This may just be my build though. Speaking of...

+-Build diversity. There are quite a few options to help your character stand out. From choosing two classes, both with their own play styles, to a character stats sheet straight from D&D. Max level is 40, which means you need to choose wisely. This is all and good, but end game requires the player to choose the Spore Warden as one of their classes to survive, hurting diversity in the long run.

+-Humor. This was the funniest writing I've experienced yet, though like usual most jokes did not land for me. BHG was amazing, though.

-+Difficulty. I had the game set to ""Intense"", where enemies took 15% less damage unless they were attacked by the proper element, which did 25% more. Even when using the wrong element, I still melted bosses without issue. General mobbing had a nice balance though. Good to see Fire isn't objectively the best anymore.

+-Story. Borderlands 2 sets a very high bar when it comes to story, but I wouldn't completely dismiss what they tried here. The antagonist is leagues better than Borderlands 3's.

-+Similarities. A lot of people feel this is too similar to Borderlands 3 to justify the price tag. I share the same opinion as the general gameplay isn't terribly different, though I loved Borderland 3's. 40 CAD would be a better price.

+-Darkness elementals. While it's nice to have a element that heals you, least on intense, the damage loss generally isn't worth it unless you dedicate a weapon solely to getting health back.

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

-Audio levels. For whatever reason, the game is abnormally quiet, even with the in game settings cranked to max. No game configuration files to adjust it further either. My work around was to blast OS volume to compensate, leading to explosive notifications..

-Bugs. Though not a broken mess, a few bugs kept reappearing during play. Dialog subtitles did not display properly, like not showing at all, disappearing too quickly, or repeating dialog from a previous cut scene. Another bug is the ""interact"" tip that would get stuck on your screen until you encounter another object that can be interacted with.

-Default crosshair position. Cannot understand why the crosshair is towards the bottom centre of the screen by default, it's an easy fix and I am fine with the option, but why default?

-No safe space adjustment. Ultra first world problem I know, but the ability to adjust UI elements to be closer to the centre of the screen was present in Borderlands 3.

-Performance. Specs: 5900x, 3080 Ti with 32GB Ram, all tuned for optimal performance. Borderlands 3 granted me a constant 95+ fps at 3840x1600 near max settings, where here I would run in the 70s - 80s, sometimes dropping to 50s despite no real increase in fidelity. FSR is a good addition, though I do not have much experience with upscaling technologies. In my case, FSR caused stuttering.

[h1] TLDR [/h1]

+Good changes for the franchise
+Antagonist isn't annoying
+FSR Inclusion
+Lots of build options, limited by end game though
+Magic is neat
-Performs worse than expected
-Obtuse bugs

Hopefully this turns into a full spin off series, it rivals my love for Borderlands 1. Highly recommend, on sale.

The few people that gave this game a negative review mostly didn't make sense what their reasoning was. And given that, Its hard to recommend to everyone. With that being said, I say at least try it. I loved the game and how the combat works for this game with there being spells instead of grenade mods, along with the Skill Tree system being very creative for a D&D themed game. The story was alright, but not really memorable. (And like Borderlands 3, this game has a very unlikable, unwanted NPC.) The endgame is very grindy, like a lot of people said, But isn't that what Borderlands is about? To get the most out of the game, you have to work for it. Understandably, there are many people who simply don't have the time for spending so many hours on a game, and for that I do think there should be a difficulty option to have it be less so.

I would defiantly rate this game a 7/10. There's solid and creative combat system, but not many Legendary gear. The story is just like Borderlands 3 where it wasn't really memorable, and end game could have been made a bit differently.

Crossing the ""Borderlands feeling"" with the classical D&D/fantasy settings was a supercool move from the creators. I was really eager for the game, and actually I got what I wanted, although my thoughts are a bit mixed about my experiences.

First of all, we got such a detailed character creation that only a few games can be comparable. I think the main story is just a simple okay category, which is sad, because the first half of it started really well. On the other hand, the side missions were funny and creative, too bad some of them were just simple fetch quests. Probably the best thing I enjoyed was the gameplay, it was a big mess, a crazy chaotic blow-out of my mind, but in a good way. Enemies, so many effects, guns, screams, magics, and quirky humour, of course. I just went forward and played by ears many times. I can also adore the artists' works, the landscapes looked amazing and fit well into the fantasy. The music is disappointing, I can't recall any memorable tracks, but I still can hum some titles from Borderlands 2, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, or my personal favourite, Tales from the Borderlands.

My two big problems (and one smaller with the optimization on PC) were that the endgame builds on disgustingly massive looting, and the lack of more and braver creativity. This whole setting is screaming for more secrets, interactivities, special achievements and wild ideas. Hopefully we'll get more in the next episode...

I could run Borderlands 3 really well at roughly 80 fps on higher end graphics but this game could barely play past 30 fps on MEDIUM. I experienced constant frame dips and was hovering mainly around 19 fps between freezing and dropping to  1 fps. I was playing with a friend who has a far better computer than mine and yet even his PC was experiencing very slide-show like gameplay.

Turns out, it doesn't support DirectX 12 very well and your performance will suffer greatly if you don't 
change it to DirectX 11. Sure, you probably won't be able to run it well anyway but at least you won't suffer constant frame dips.

Every other borderlands game (although this technically isn't a borderlands game) has done something differently than the others.

Borderlands 1 was the foundation, Borderlands 2 improved on it massively with a really well written story, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel added new types of guns, took itself into space with a story that expanded on Borderlands 2 and added oxygen related mechanics, Borderlands 3 improved the gameplay and added a lot of quality of life changes. Tiny Tina Wonderlands adds....nothing. The gameplay is ripped from Borderlands 3 (but worse). The melee weapons don't really add anything, the spells are great but a lot of them are extremely boring and basic. Some spells have you summoning a huge meteor that shatters into smaller meteors, while another spell will have you shoot one ice spike and call it a day. The quality ranges greatly.

The item balancing is......meh. I obtained a spell at the very beginning of the game that has been more powerful than anything else in my 13 hours of gameplay.

The story is entirely inconsequential in every way. There are no stakes. The villain isn't even hateable. Handsome Jack had charisma and personality but was still a huge douchebag and a major villain. Tyreen and Troy are hated by the playerbase for being annoying more than anything else, but at least they're hateable and you want to shoot them. The Dragonlord however isn't dislikeable or hateable in any way shape or form, and he isn't particularly funny or interesting. He's just there.

Despite any shortcomings the game is a blast, and the comedy is next level though this is possibly because of all the amazing comic talent they've managed to get into the game. Wanda Sykes, Andy Samberg, and Will Arnett to name a few. The graphics are not particularly better than Borderlands 3 but, there is a noticeable difference in the game. My favorite so far is the addition of melee weapons, which I hope make it to borderlands 4, if we get one. There are also added little bits that make the experience all the better; a custom character for one, which is always a good addition, and the way voiced characters skirt mentioning your character's name is hilarious at times. Tina's constant interferance as a makeshift Dungeon Master is amazing, and the fact that you are literally playing on a giant game board is just icing on the cake.

The story is *meh*, although there's a lot of reference humor for friends of (TT)RPGs. The ""narrative forces"" could've been awesome, bothersomely they failed at that, though, it's just too predictable and too shallow.
The BL gameplay itself would've profited a lot by multiclassing and spells. Unfortunately the gameplay feels repetitive even with totally different characters, making the playstyle itself feel too similar. The BL branches do that better, thus giving you more replayabilty.

Still: it's BL. It's worth being played, it's solid craftsmanship and it will consume your hours.

If you loved Tiny Tina's DLC in borderlands 2, this will be a dream come true for you.

Didn't expect much because of the earliest reviews, but it is so much better than I thought. 

It incorporated all the good features of previous games.

The only 5 downsides are: 1) Mainly the storyline. Nothing too interesting, some funny parts, but even humor could always be better. With a better story for each ark and side quest, it would be a complete package of a borderlands experience. Story is definitely better than Borderlands 3, but nowhere close to Borderlands 2.  2) a bit too easy, the balancing could be tweaked a bit. 3) What happened to the cross-character stats/achievements/bonus hero stat points? It would be great to add it back on 4) steam achievements are not creative 5) Didnt like the long press to drop items, instant would be better

All the loot in the world and none of it good. Never had a weapon beyond level 5 i had any attachment too. The overworld slogs down gameplay.

I never played a part of the game where i felt like ""wow this would be so much better with 3 other people""

i enjoyed my time. it was a solid shut my brain off and slog through a campaign in a few nights. it is what i needed it to be. but when i finished it made me want to go speedrun borderlands 2 more than play ttw again. gearbox has really lost the pulse of it's franchise. increasing the map size and decreasing the -everything else enjoyable- has not worked. i really don't remember alot of bl3 and had similar feelings aside from a few set pieces that were best in co op. modern rpg's keep struggling to let you be over powered or under powered. i want to go to a level 5 area when im level 2 and struggle. i want to go back to that level 5 area when im a level 17. having everything leveled the same as you is not fun.stop doing this",1669580741,1669580741,True,0,0,0.483870983123779297,0,True,False,False

I'm also playing this with two friends with whom I have played all previous Borderlands games. And through the entire series - including Wonderlands - we've been struggling with bugs. This time in Wonderlands, the worst bugs were not being able to fire or reload weapons, graphic glitches and pretty bad lags affecting only one of the group at a time.

Same engine, trying new things, named enemies don't offer much, but it gets the general vibe of what people liked about its predecessors. Some very fun mechanics are implemented (i.e. spells instead of grenades and multi-classing), however, it's the level of dedication to the main reason people play this game that is lacking. Relatable characters and an emotional attachment to them, fun times farming for weapons you can actually obtain to make a build out of, end game content to keep you coming back, and of course the OST. Nothing in this game will make you feel the way you did walking into Fyrestone (or even Sanctuary) for the first time. It is a pure entertainment in the short term and it does it well. Do all you can during the first run, mainly because you can change your secondary class later in the game, and enjoy the ride. But as a general rule, that I realized after TPS, don't ever buy the Season Pass for Borderlands games that aren't numbered. Happy shlooting! But keep your expectations reasonable.

If you look at this game as very expansive DLC for Borderlands 3, under the assumption you enjoy Borderlands 3, you'll likely enjoy this game — if you're not sold on the hack n' slash genre but with guns and the camera being first person instead of being isometric, stay very far away form this game.

[h3]So, what's the difference between this and Borderlands 3?[/h3]
• Melee weapons are now loot, they have weapon manufacturers and are no longer tied to specific characters.
• Grenades are replaced by spells and no longer act as a consumable but are rather recharged by a cooldown period.
• There's a lot of customization up front for your hero, voice, appearance, class etc. [u]Unparalleled to other Borderlands' games.[/u]
• Guardian Rank is replaced by Mythic Rank.
• Your character has an actual stat sheet; dexterity, strength, wisdom, all that good stuff. This is in addition to the traditional skill tree that Borderlands characters have.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2893868460
• There's an overworld map that has dungeons, random encounters that can be explored, as opposed to a HUB city. (Which is still present.)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2893868480

And that's pretty much it. The gun manufacturers, should you have developed a favorite by now, have slightly different names from the mainline Borderlands' games. Jakobs is now Blackpowder and Dahl is now Dahlia for example. All in some vaguely humorous attempt to create a more [i]fantastic[/i] setting.

[b]If this all sounds great, read no further, enjoy the game.[/b]

The entire game is based on the [i]allegedly[/i] popular Borderlands 2 DLC “Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep”. I was never that fond of that DLC: I'm still pondering if that is due to me not liking the  Tiny Tina character, not generally enjoying [i]most[/i] fantasy settings or the fact that they tried to jam an ostensibly sci-fi theme into a fantasy setting, just for sake of it. 

[h3]But here's the thing I keep coming back to...[/h3]
These reviews are for sharing your opinion and whether or not you'd [i]recommend[/i] that someone [i]else[/i] purchase and play a specific title. And for that I would say, if you enjoy Borderlands, buy this on sale. There's really nothing worth full price here. Don't get me wrong, there are some [u]great[/u] ideas in this game that are just poorly executed. If you're on the fence, just skip it.

I do see it as a stepping stone for Borderlands 4 or whatever they call the next mainline Borderlands. More customization is always good, maybe one day they'll make a DLC package that suits everyone's desires but this one leaves a lot to be desired.

I cannot overstate how cringe the writing is. It's so bad that despite the gameplay mechanics being really really fun I would never recommend this to a friend, because I'd be worried that they think that I think the writing is funny.

I honestly don't know if I have words for just how bad it is. As an example, there is a character, who is a unicorn, who is the queen of the land you're playing in, called Princess Buttstallion. If you think that's funny, you might enjoy the story, but honestly if you think that's funny you might enjoy fingerpainting with your own feces.

The actual game is great, its an arena shooter at heart and a looter shooter beyond that. I  actually enjoy playing the game but I literally, physically cringe whenever I finish an area and a character starts talking. Every single piece of dialogue is so bad that its painful. I tried to turn dialogue volume all the way down but I'm yet to find the subtitle setting so had to turn it back on.

Imagine a game where the greatest deterrent is the fully voice acted dialogue. It blows my mind, I can't believe Will Arnett looked at this script and said ""sure, that's worth my time"".

On top of that its insultingly expensive. I got it on special for 50% and still wouldn't recommend it at that price. 

There are at least 10 other games that do the same thing if not better, then just as well, for a 10th of the price and with far better writing.

I'm going to continue playing this game, but never in a million years would I tell anyone that I cared about that they should buy it. They could probably have saved a million dollars dropping the writers and the voice acting and the game would have been twice as good.

Again. Just so it's clear. The writing is so bad that I constantly consider giving up on this game (past the point of refunding now) whenever a cutscene plays.

Randy, this is what a good game is.
All other borderlands games will be measured against this, the best Borderlands game since 2.
Stop trying to be funny.

They had a good opportunity to make something and different at least on some levels but instead they just took borderlands and implemented it with some new classes in a fantasy world full of guns. it feels like it might as well just have been any other borderlands game at this point. Here are some of the sort comings I was left with.

Gameplay:
I played as a Spellshot which was suppose to be a spellcaster that uses guns, instead I throw out a few spells and then its all gun gameplay, that part can be fine but depends heavily on how good your weapons are, it can easily switch between being boring and annoying to fun to being to easy all depending on how good your weapon is at different times. and sometimes you just get trash. For the Spellshot class you get one ability and one spell, but you can instead choose to sac the ability for a 2nd spell which is overall much better. About halfway through the game you can add a second class which felt a bit strange because it seems better to finish off the skills in your own class before going into the new class. You do however gain access to 2nd classes skillls, great right? Not really because thats shared between your primary class so instead of getting additional options you end up just using the one with 2 spells from Spellshot. what a waste. All game you are using 2 spell keys and then just shooting.

Story:
Story is often very over the top and imo ruined by Tiny Tina speaking over whats happened so no chance to get engaged in it. And again its Borderlands all over right down to the bad guy ""calling"" you to monologue because he is basically the only bad guy in the game that has a voice. I did find some of the side missions pretty funny and engaging.

Looting:
Its a looting shooter and that part is really awful. Between the limited inventory you have to upgrade for a few extra slots, to the awful inventory UI you have to go through to discard, drop or sell, to the crazy amount of loot you have to decide if you want on the ground. It also feels like half the guns are basically just crossbows which are godawful since bolts dropoff quickly, or sawblades(even worse), so thats half the guns out. The RNG loot is awful too, the worst part was at the end of the game where the NPC all seriously tells me you need some armor befitting of your status Knight and then gives me a legendary armor for another class, its one thing what drops is random(thats awful too) but why is my quest rewards random too. 

Conclusion:
Its just another borderlands game from the borderlands factory, no soul, nothing new, just the same crap again. If you like Borderlands you will probably like this, if you come here for something else or new, find something else instead friend.",1669469598,1669469598,False,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

If you like any of the Borderlands games, liked BL2's Tiny Tina DLC, and or a fan of DnD who wants to play a game with friends then you might like this game.

Despite its name it is very much still a Borderlands game at its core, but it has enough to differentiate itself from its predecessors; namely an overworld in lieu of vehicles, multi-classing, and spells instead of grenades. All of that plus more has me considering Wonderlands an improvement over Borderlands 3, so much so that it might be my second favourite game in the franchise, just behind Borderlands 2. Compared to 3 it has a better story (though that is a low bar and this game's story isn't amazing either, just ok) and the gameplay loop is a lot more fun, in my opinion.

The game has some glaring flaws though. Post launch content, DLC, and endgame content are abysmal, probably the worst out of every Borderlands game. There are no DLC campaigns, no second playthrough, and no level cap increase, and these missing features/content severely reduce the amount of content the game has to offer when compared to previous series entries. It has a pretty robust character creator giving you more customisation options than previous games, but it also lacks weapon skins, trinkets, and the full colour wheel that Borderlands 3 introduced to the series.

Overall this is the type of game I expect most to play through once and not touch again, which is completely fine, but if you are really into Borderlands and just want to play more of that kind of game then this can scratch that itch. Either way, definitely get it on sale as it isn't worth paying full price for. The DLCs are very lackluster so if you aren't a completionist then you can skip them completely, though the 4th DLC adds a 7th class so that's something you can consider.

Endgame and DLCs on the other hand are very bad and lacking content and replayability, they pretty much non-existent.
Other than the extremely repetitive and poorly balanced chaos chambers/levels and the headhunter-like very short DLCs... sorry, PLCs* that cost almost as much as the full-fledged story DLCs for BL3 there's nothing else. There is not even a TVHM, or rather TFMM (True Fate Maker Mode) aka NG+ that would allow you to replay through the story at max level.
The game becomes pretty stale very quickly due to the lack of content, especially endgame, and the poor replayability. At this point I wouldn't mind a 2nd Season Pass, but with proper story expansion DLCs like we saw for the previous BL titles which is unlikely to happen.
The game itself is not bad and I really want to love it and to be able to recommend but I really can't do it in good conscience in its current state.

I like the theme and most of the mechanics (Especially how spells and melee weapons work) However I'd be happier if Mythic Ranks helped characters pre 40 or some other persistent account thing (like the old badass rank).  Story wise I enjoyed the game but it lacks the depth of the original story had.  Lastly there seems be to be a fair number of bugs and QOL issues that none of the other Borderlands games had by this time in develpment.

For reference, i have also bought this on the Epic games store and completed it (just in case my hours in game dont match with what im saying )

The story is interesting and has its moments, set as a game of their version of Dungeons and Dragons its not tied down trying to fit in with any plots from any other titles too much. 

The gameplay is fun with various classes each having their own strengths/ weakness.

Each  class gets a passive ability, for some its a companion monster to fight along side you, others its  a passive effect. 

Whats cool is that they allow you to duel class, you cant change your 1st class at all, you can only change your 2nd class after you have completed the story so choose wisely. That said its up to you if you want to min/max effectiveness or just go with whatever is cool.

The customisation options are great, you can pick from a large variety of options to create your perfect Fatemaker, you can customise things like  your own banner and statues that appear in the town as well. 

Furthermore you can get more customisation options as drops in the world so you may find a new hair style, or armour layer/colour that you enjoy after you have made the character. The new ones you collect stay unlocked so even if you choose to start a new character you will have more option later on. 

This being borderlands - esc game ( and as of this review nominated for ""Better with friends"" award"") it would be a nice amount of fun chaos with spells and explosions all over....i assume im an anti social solo player so i can't comment too much :P

The endgame is matter of perspective and what you enjoy from the game. Be it story or challenge its time to Grind the Chaos Chambers, they offer a challenge where you can grind several levels, if you found the game to easy then these will offer the chance to buff enemies and/or Nerf you somewhat, you get more points that you can then spend on chances to get loot of a specific item. 

But personally  i found that once i reached that point i put the game down for a bit. Im mainly in it for the story, i have other games that i will put my grind hours into :) 

Came back to it new classes, new personality and its fun to sink some time into

As a side note i will only mention the DLC's briefly as they can get their own reviews. 

They are...optional....is how i would describe them, they are essentially 4 more side quests that have a vague story behind them.  They come with another class and voice option which is nice, but best to see if you can get them on a deal if possible as there isn't much meat to them. I would guess their main purpose is to add to the pool of levels and challenges for the Chaos chambers. 

Overall i would say give the game a go, if you enjoy borderlands you will enjoy this.

I played this game a bit, 57 hours, and I did not 100% it.  But I do not want to at all.  After the story the game gets very grindy in a very small game play loop.

I will try to be brief...

Pros:
- Its more borderlands
- New loot is neat and a refreshing change to the borderlands formula (Spells instead of grenades, crossbow weapons)
- The Story is cool to follow, I did really like the main villain
- I did like the over world map, for better or worse it cut out a lot of the filler in previous borderlands that made you use their terrible driving system to just plow through areas and pad game time
- I liked some of the unique areas you would travel to, they each felt unique
- Side quests were kind of amusing at times, and not all of them felt grindy

Cons:
- I am in the minority here, but it was too much Tina.  I like her as a support role, but she got obnoxious here.  Not to mention trying to fist in some emotional dialogue with Tina
- The two new support characters I found boring.  They were just commentators really.  The Robots voice was annoying to me and the other character was a text book ""stupid knight""
- The actual map (M Key map) is the same terrible to use map from all the previous borderlands.  Can you make a functional map please??  You can never lock the orientation of the map (similar to previous titles) and it is VERY slow to scroll on a PC.  I have a mouse, that should make navigating this easier!  This is definitely a console port side effect
- Since the loot is RNG and you could very well roll loot that does not benefit skills of your class, 99% of your drops will be useless to you.  Since loot can roll buffs to multiple classes (since you can dual class) your chances of getting loot with buffs that you want, well, you will need to dump HUNDREDS of hours into getting that one drop.
- Speaking of loot, its not clear at all what loot you get is the best.  Its hard to see the difference between higher tier loot because it just has a glowing skull on the top and its a bit brighter of a border.  And my regular gold weapon is better than the super skull one I got.
- Your Appearance is determine by the ""Armor mod"" you are wearing.  Similar to a class mod.  You can change the texture and color of your gear, but it will always look the same.  I would argue there are more customization options but they are all really small.  Sure, ""Red"" and ""Rose"" colored are two options, but there is not much difference between them.
- End game is non-existent.  Through the game you dive into small dungeon instances which are basically defeat the wave of enemies three times, maybe two.  It was OK as a side thing, but that is actually end game.  When you finish the story you can just grind out waves of enemies in the same small maps for rare chances to get better loot just so you can keep playing the same exact small dungeon.
- There are four ""DLC"" dungeons.  But after you do each once, you really don't want to go back.  All the effort is not near worth the payout of random junk you are just going to not even pickup eventually
- The ""Dual Class System"" sounds good on paper, but you only get two skill tree's.  Compared to previous titles Three Skill Tree's this is a huge downgrade.  And you don't get enough points to make both viable, so you will really only focus on one tree.  The only ""advantage"" is you get to flip between two classes action skills.  But you wont want to, as your entire tree will only really compliment one skill.
- To me, most of the classes felt weak and under powered.  Most of them felt like they might have end game viability but that doesn't help early game.
- Classes felt VERY linear.  With only one skill tree (two when you dual class), you basically just went with a damage type (like frost) and buffed it.  Not a lot of flexibility in play style.

The cons out weight the pros.  It might be worth it on deep sale to play the story and get a bit more borderlands, but the story is much shorter than previous titles and end game will not keep you busy for long.",1669251748,1669251748,False,1,0,0.50186532735824585,0,True,False,False

Tiny Tina hosting the game with Jake Peralta and a sassy droid is hilarious. 
Will Arnedt is a really compelling villian.
Game is just as fun as BL3 and personally I find the spell way better and more fun and useful than grenades. Mixing and matching different classes sound interesting, but overall it felt a little underdeveloped.
Personally I didn't really like having a costumizable character (in general not a fan of this), they usually feel really bland and forgetable, even though the voice I chose had really fun lines and really liked him, but them not having a ""name and face"" is not my cup of tea.
My biggest issue with this game is similar to the other BL spin off (The Pre-Sequel) that for a full priced game (even with 20% off @ 64€ for the version with season pass) the game is way too short. (about 25h for the main story with more stuff to play afterwards) In comparision I paid about 50€ or 60€ for the same version of BL3 on its Steam launch and I got about 80h for the story and way more with the DLCs and other content (currently at 166h and still can play more, if I had the time). Additionally I was missing a lot of the characters from other games.

If you are a fan of the Borderlands series, you can't go wrong with this at any price, in my opinion. However, if you are looking into getting into the series, definitely go the other entries in the series and wait for this game to get cheaper.

There are a lot of new features; spells, melee weapons, creating your own character, etc., and I enjoy every single one of them. I feel like a lot of the new features makes the side content more worth doing, unlike in Borderlands 3, where the side content is boring and feels tedious to do. 

I don't know how's the end game content compared to the previous Borderlands series (I haven't finished Tiny Tina's Wonderlands at the time I wrote this review), but I definitely had more fun on my first playthrough in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands compared to the previous Borderlands series (so far).

My favourite things about Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is its world design, it's beautifully made, and some places reminds me a lot of Trine series, which I really love. It also seems to be well optimized on most places (except Brighthoof), and in my experience, runs a lot smoother than Borderlands 3.",1656349267,1669226584,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you're somebody who enjoys spending hours farming for perfect gear to finish that OP10 run, this game probably isn't for you. The main campaign is great fun though. Tons of nods to D&D, and the lucky dice system is perfect. Collectibles are usually just busy work, but the loot luck system makes these worth searching for from the start. The story is fun, and the ending is satisfying. The voice acting is great. Combat always balances well, and loot and enemy scaling seems to favor more casual players once you hit the level cap. So it's less suited to the hardcore, but great for people without 1000 hours to dump into a game.

The endgame loop isn't fantastic, mostly because the random mission generator feels like most random mission generators- a bit random. Pick an arena, pick some enemies, pick a boss, rinse and repeat. To their credit, the chaos chamber always balances well, which is tricky to do consistently. But to me the lack of story or progression makes it feel flat. Plus every map is an arena, so while they're all visual distinct, they all play exactly the same. The DLCs feel like a more polished version with some additional story to tie it all together, plus the boss progression that I haven't tried yet. They're worth grabbing on sale IMO, though I don't regret buying the whole thing at launch.

Overall, it's a great game for normal people, if not for the borderlands hardcore crowd.",1669220182,1669220182,True,0,0,0.497972965240478516,0,True,False,False

It makes for some incredibly fun and refreshed game play. The story is funny and captivating with the world and graphics looking renewed and lively without requiring top of the line specs. It also gives incentive to actually explore off the main path in search of areas for loot dice and lore scrolls that are sort of like echo logs but actually interesting.  
The best part by far is the addition of spells, changeable melee weapons, and guns which are completely different from the other borderlands games. The elemental type effects that your weapons sometimes have can have amazing synergies with spells and abilities if you pair them right against your foes which allows you to shred through enemies and have a blast.
If you're a fan of borderlands I would definitely recommend you to pick this game up and play it. Even if you aren't a fan of borderlands I would still at least give it a try if you're looking for a new game to play.

The game features an overworld-area that works as a linkage between the different playable areas. I have no fucking clue why the areas are not just linked to each other like in previous games but I guess they somehow had to find a way to remove joy from the gameplay experience.

There also is a thing called ""encounters"" when you travel around in the overworld. These can appear randomly or as part of a quest or as an obstacle to get somewhere. In these encounters you are just placed in a small arena like map where you have to fight off a bunch of enemies. The problem here is that there are only ever 4-5 enemies alive at the same. New enemies only spawn once you kill another enemy. You don't get too much exciting combat action out of them. Oh, and sometimes you have to do SEVEN of these boring encounters in a row. Unfortunately, it is as tedious as it sounds.

The story is horrible. To be honest, the Borderlands franchise is famous for having weak stories and humor that is written by and for 13 year olds, but this game takes that stuff to the next level.

If you ignore all the bad stuff, you might get a mediocre gameplay experience out of this. The guns have many new effects and are different to the ones from BL3, however, most of these new effects just feel terrible to play with so you'll avoid most weapon types in your playthrough anyway.

More of the jokes and attempts at humor hit their mark, and the references to other fantasy series and TTRPG's are hilarious. Tiny Tina is as eccentric and hilarious as usual. The handful of new characters that are introduced are far more likable than, uhh, certain new characters in BL3 were. Gunplay is still tight and responsive, the classes are varied and unique, locations are diverse and interesting, enemy type and variety is nice (and also predictably absurd.)

The inventory system has been thoroughly fantasy-fied, and is a lot better for it in my opinion. 'Wards' are the equivalent to shields in the BL games, class mods are now called 'armor', and both of these function basically the same as their BL counterparts. Grenades have been replaced by spells, which provide many different effects such as high aoe damage, crowd control, aoe buff/debuff fields, etc, and are far more useful than grenades ever were in BL games, outside of maybe the original. The primary differences in the inventory system however come from the addition of 3 new equipment slots, 1 for an amulet and 2 for rings. These act as a bit of a hybrid between class mods or armor, and the artifacts from BL3 and include many different effects, from gun/spell/skill damage, elemental damages, loot luck, boosts to certain weapon types, melee damage, and a lot more. Having more items that add random modifiers to your character really helps when it comes to min/maxing and loot grinding, which is  still the core gameplay loop in Wonderlands.

The 4 main elemental damage types from BL2/3 are still here; Incendiary, Cryo, Shock, and Poison (corrosive). The 5th elemental damage type this time around is called 'Dark Magic' which heals your character for a percentage of the damage dealt. This synergizes well with certain action skills and health stacking characters, and can be boosted a lot by class skill trees and items. In my opinion this status effect is better than both slag from BL2 and radiation from BL3 by a decently high margin, and hopefully something with a similar effect will be added to future mainline BL titles.

As far as negatives go, the story is significantly shorter than BL2/3's story, and the endgame chaos mode can get repetitive pretty quickly. This wasn't an issue for me specifically, and it likely won't be for anyone who is used to or enjoys grinding and maximizing their build potential, but for more casual players there isn't really much to tether them to the game once the story and side quests are finished (roughly 25 hours). 

The primary downside to Wonderlands however, is the absolutely awful excuses for ""DLC"". Each of the 3 currently released DLC's include a repeatable dungeon with 5 new areas + 1 new boss and... not much else. These new areas and bosses get added to the chaos mode pool after beating them once, which adds a bit of variety to that mode but not enough to make it worth the asking price. The 4th DLC is coming with a new class, and might be a better value than the first 3, but as of this review it is not out yet. At $10 a pop, or $30 for all 4 with the season pass, this is decided NOT worth it, and I doubt the inclusion of a new class will change that at all. Once again, this issue wasn't as big for me because I purchased the chaotic great edition for 20% off ($64) when it launched on steam, so I effectively only paid $4 more than retail for the DLC, but the season pass/DLC outside of maybe the 4th one is a HARD pass at retail price.

Tack the issues that the melee is finicky and the gunplay is meh at best, and the buffering that they did with ""Dungeon Encounters"" to help pad out the time, it really just feels half finished and haphazardly put together. I do suggest picking this up, so long as it is reasonably discounted by 50-75%, and picking it up if you have friends who would play with you.",1669143627,1669143627,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are more classes and since its dnd themed, it really brings that classic mid-evil touch with a modern finish.  There is also multi classes so that really adds diversity to play styles. Spells were also added along with your action skill so it also adds an extra spectrum of damage and elemental balancing to the game. Which means, more buttons to press.

The gameplay is par for the course for the series; it's more of the same, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Although there's less variety in weaponry, the class system has been expanded upon, and abilities play a larger role in gameplay. Character customisation is also a welcome addition, with a modest variety of options.

My major criticism of the game is the endgame content, which is mainly just a rogue-lite mode where you clear procedurally generated encounters and replay campaign boss fights with modifiers active. I found that it got repetitive quickly, and there was little incentive to continue after a few runs. The game could use some well-crafted dungeons/raids.

Additionally. the campaign is far too easy on the highest difficulty, especially if you min-max efficiently. I would have liked it if encounters presented more of a challenge, and required me to evaluate my tactics. I rarely had to consider my elemental damage and resistances, and would have preferred if they played a bigger role.

Overall this is a solid buy for fans of looter shooters and I enjoyed my time with it.

In long: Borderlands is the titular series were the phrase ""looter shooter"" takes you when it's used. The concept is fairly uncomplicated: You run around in first-person shooting anything that moves against you, and most enemies are pinatas of prizes waiting to be cracked open. Get better weapons/gear by cracking open said pinatas; rinse, and repeat.

If that is your ish, then Tiny Tina's will not disappoint. Even in the fantasy setting, with options for melee, magic, and companions, guns will be your primary weapon and you'll be finding yourself bouncing around arena-like areas killing baddies and sucking up their loot. Boss fights are literally just a big baddie with an even bigger health pool that you have to shoot for longer while dodging or hiding behind cover.

If you're someone with even a passing knowledge of Tabletop RPGs, TTW may also entertain you as well. It's an overall homage to the classic past time with barely a fourth wall to get between you and what's happening in the game. You play a nameless player who is stuck in a cave with Tiny Tina, a robot named Frette (played by Wanda Sykes), and some mercenary named Valentine. The how and why doesn't really matter; all that matters is you've got all the time in the world to play Bunkers & Badasses, the Borderlands equivalent to D&D. TT is a prime dungeon mistress--and all the miniatures and other stuff are hers anyway--so you dive into an adventure of her making.

Her occasional narration at key points is what keeps you grounded in the fact that you're playing a game within a game. It's key to the progression, especially since sometimes she has to change the narrative to allow you to advance--a thing DMs are all too familiar with. Overall, her voice is a welcome part of indicating progression and the start of a new round of foes.

You have classes to choose from, but I honestly haven't played with any other than the Spore Warden so far. I do think, however, with the emphasis on guns, that all classes will prettymuch end up feeling pretty samey over time. I chose Spore Warden because it felt like I was going to lean the most towards a ranger type with it, and other than some magical bow shot I get to do on occasion, I definitely do not feel like anything other then the usual shooter type from the Borderlands series.

Am I wowed by this game? Not really. To be fair, though, I enjoy story and exploration a lot more, and while the game-within-a-game is providing some chuckles, I am not as invested in the story of TTW as I was in other games. There is also a clear linearity to it. Yes, there are ""open world"" areas and arenas but they are limited in space and scope, and once you do find the few secrets hidden, there isn't going to be much reason to keep looking around. The game means for you to shoot your way from Point A to Point B as quickly as possible.

Overall I'd say it's a good game for mindless play. If you just want something to play with your friends, you can't go wrong here. The fights are fast-paced, the banter is amusing, and the levels are pretty quick. If your idea of RPG is something more nuanced, however, you might want to save your money.",1668747677,1668747677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- red texts didn't feel unique. 
- nothing seemed to have any semblance of health aside from a couple sidequest bosses.
- spells are cool but so limited and just feel like an extra point for activations rather than an extra damaging part of your arsenal.
- skill trees are okay I suppose, but nothing that drastically changes your game (both positive and negative).
- Loot Luck (negative), joking aside I wish they'd done it right, having a higher world drop chance would've been great, but making all drops rely on it including dedicated just felt iffy to me, and took away from wanting to farm as opposed to just running the game as fast as possible
- chaos chambers are just every other random encounter with maybe a different modifier or objective, not fun in the slightest
- stats feel pointless outside of crit chance and crit damage, speaking of I don't like the idea of no crit spots and having it rely on a % as it let me hit something stupid like 80% crits, all the time, power boosted past the usual 2x.

as for the good of the game
- gods is it gorgeous, a lot of scenery just made me stop and stare and appreciate how much effort has gone into it over the usual strict cell shading
- most of the melee weapons have a really satisfying swing to them and the generous swing hitbox only accentuates that, it made slamming enemies with a massive axe/sword/hammer/bonkstick just hit different. 
- character customisation is top notch, allowing for a slider override to be a giant or just a lil guy was admittedly funny, but also allowed for a better character I felt suited me.
- The story is great, more focused on tinas inner mechanisms than an actual openboard story, but great nonetheless, definitely giving a great insight into a character already beloved by the community.

while I wouldn't recommend picking it up outside of a sale, or buying any of the dlc, it's defo worth at least a little bit of your time.

Not a remarkable game in any way. Just a regular ole post BL2 Borderlands game. The random encounters do the game a disservice. It just feels derivative and inconsequential. Random encounter after random encounter for every side-quest and shrine piece gets pretty old pretty fast.

The humour is very tired. Mostly out-of-touch or forced jokes that only beget an eye roll. The overwhelming majority of the humour is just Tina's ""growly"" voice. Over, and over, and over. 

The gunplay sucks, just like every Borderlands game. But this game somehow feels worse since there are only two or three unique weapons in the entire game. Everything else is randomly generated. Even quest items and boss weapons.

The DLC is just so boring. Vesper is hot, but that's about the only good thing. It's a few tedious little rooms that have arbitrary wait-timers to progress. All to earn a DLC currency to roll for some gear. Nothing really fun or interesting. You have to complete each mirror 5 times to ""beat"" it. Really lazy way to ""extend"" the play time. Oh, and if you play any of the DLC, it will bug your subtitles and you'll have the last thing Vesper says on your screen until you restart the game.

The game has a lot of fun references. I guess that's about it.

The collectable hunt is really not fun, and really pointless. 

The voice acting in this game is really terrible. It's amazing how awful it is.

The ""RPG"" elements are simply thematic. They have no impact on gameplay. It's literally just a regular Borderlands game, but without all of the fun Borderlands stuff.

The music is uninspired. 

Earning cosmetics is a slog. They drop randomly from random enemies, and you'll almost certainly get the same one a hundred times.

If you really like Borderlands, I would recommend buying this game at like 50% off, at the minimum. Definitely skip the DLC. You're not missing anything.",1668303716,1668304221,False,8,2,0.53685230016708374,0,True,False,False

However I quickly forgave them this wasted opportunity by the way this whole situation is framed within the game. Tiny Tina is your BnB (Bunkers and Badasses) master and she puts you into a Disney-esque fantasy world at first. However her imagination is both limited to her post-apocalyptic existence as well to being a child. It's not long before she hands out the first gun and everyone in the party goes ""what...?"". You know she's a child when the bartender in town tells you that they sell only soda, and the only food they ever eat is sweets.

The DnD aspect is integrated masterfully. Often you're walking around going about your business, then Tina mentions something like ""sky darkens and your hear loud explosions"". Those things then really happen in the game world, sometimes completely changing the map in real time.

You can customize your appearance at the start and in contrast to the previous games, you don't play a predefined character.  There are 7 classes to choose from, each of which has 2 active abilities to choose from and a bunch of passives. So far I wasn't very impressed with the skill tree. Disappointingly, you can't use a melee weapon as your main weapon (i.e. left click) - melee hits are still done by pressing V. Instead of grenades, here you equip spells that can be either projectile based, throw a meteor on someone's head, AoE damage or protection auras, and whatnot.

From what I can tell, as always this game does not really give you the option to go full melee or full spell based, you'll always have to use the shooty shooties. Yes I'm actually still salty about it. But going in with the expectation that this is a traditional Borderlands game, it's definitely among the best in the series in terms of presentation and style.",1668256954,1668256954,True,1,0,0.519774019718170166,0,True,False,False

I've never played BL1 and 2, and have up to 58 hours in BL3, which never really ressonated with me. I was playing it with friends and at some point I dropped it because I just found the setting and characters uninteresting and boring (except Claptrap, everybody loves that little guy).

This one on the other hand, is a complete 180 turn for me. I've been enjoying it a LOT which in great part I attribute it to the setting and overall fantasy design. On top of that, the gameplay feels extremely fluid and fun, and something that bothered me GREATLY in BL3 is not present in this game, which is legendary actually being super rare and exciting in TTW.

I've played all of the Borderlands games and several mods on top. This is in my top 2 of all the Borderlands games. The combat is engaging and different (spells instead of grenades). The SETTING is a huge plus to this game as the environments are different vs the typical HUGE open spaces in the Borderlands series which are clumsily navigated with vehicles.

Overall I give this a solid 8.5/10. I played about 10 hours of endgame which indeed does devolve into a few boss runs and chaos chambers but that's generally no that different from original Borderlands.

Jokes are meh, lot of times recycled from previous entries, not to be just negative there are some that are well done.
My biggest issue is with Overworld, all of the smaller encounters and dungeons are super repetetive with tiny map pool and often too low spawn rate of enemies. Sadly it feels like it is an attempt to hide the fact that the game length is way shorter than BL3.
Addition of melee weapons seemed cool but unless you are going with full-on melee build they are plain useless, I'd much rather see some equivalent for laser weapons.

However the game still manages to fall short in many ways. The core game is really enjoyable and will have you engaged for many hours, the humour is on point for what you should expect from the franchise as a whole. The major pit falls with Tiny Tina's Wonderlands are the DLCs and the story as a whole. The DLCs are short, and I mean very short. They have attempted to pad the play time out with increasing difficulty options but if like me you turn to DLCs after the main gain then you will fly through these and they become annoying to have to do them each four times over. The story also seems lacking and at times like they padded it out to make the game a bit longer, very similar feeling to that of the DLCs.

However, if you take in to consideration that this game is the successor of a small DLC from an earlier game then everything begins to make much more sense, and in turn feel less disappointing. I feel that it is unfair to hold Tiny Tina's Wonderlands up against the main series games as it simply cannot compete. However, as a successor to the Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep it has done an amazing job with one exception, the price.

If you buy this game on sale, I am talking 50% or more off, then I would say it is a great game for the money. Otherwise give it a miss.",1668013975,1668013975,True,2,0,0.508647918701171875,0,True,False,False

Clunky User interface, guns that didnt feel good to shoot, and unecessary portals, or pokemon like encounters really took away from the immersion, if your playing with friends its annoying to have to wait for everybody to get out of the menu to travel, in 3-4 hours of gameplay i felt unchallenged, i could literally facetank enemies on intense difficulty around level 10... it was a decent attempt at a humorous deviation from borderlands universe, unfortunately me and my 2 gaming friends who i play with felt the same, and we dropped the game about 3-4 hours in...

Yes it does not continue the original Borderlands story nor have the original characters, besides Tina and Brick. It keeps the little haha's and funnies and quite decent gameplay along with it's own RPG-based story, which can be a hit or miss if you like that stuff. I found it nice. I grabbed the Chaotic Edition on sale and can say it's very much worth it. Nice extra content with the chaotic edition. Okay replayability, although I hear the end game chaos runs can be dog water (I've yet to see that for myself) I started off on Intense difficulty and for at few times it was difficult, the rest was a damn breeze. Really needs more challenge to make it less boring. Again with the Chaos difficulties I'm not sure how much harder it would get end game.

If you love Borderlands as a whole, This game is a must cop. Geniunely enjoying every second of this game. Deffintly better than borderlands 3 in my opinion, Better than Borderlands 2 However, nothing will top BL2, Its still the best game in the Franchise. Fuck all the bad reviews, If you enjoy Borderlands, get this game, you wont be disapointed.

PROS:
* FUN GUNS(its crazy what the game brings in terms of gun aspects, feels very balanced, even the purple loot is super viable. Different elements on guns such as; Life steal, Slow((Ice)) Explosion, Fire, Corrosive etc... 
*MAGIC!!!! (There are no gernades in this game, Instead of Gernades in the Borderlands Franchise, The gernades are swapped for Magic, WHICH IS FUCKING SICK The vast variety of the types of magic is insane, They got big ass meteors, Cyclones, Magic circles etc... Think of Skyrim spells, introduced to Borderlands. Its really fucking sick, espeecially with the different elements, types of magic, elemental stats etc... Its so vast and very fun, You will enjoy this aspect of the game a ton?
*STORY( The story is so entertaining, Will keep you laughing, The plot is so witty and Ridiculous, keeps you entertained thouroughly, This is TINAS WORLD, Where the bullshit, funny encounters, EXPLOSIONSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS and fun never ends
*SCENERY( Okay geniunely, the maps are really cool, much more diverse than any post apocalyptic borderlands scene you will get from your average borderlands game, This really spices it up!
*MOBS (This right here was what i was afraid of, as I was watching people say that the game had only 1 main mob type, everyone saying SKELETONS SKELETONS SKELETONS YOU WILL ONLY SEE THESE MOBS ON REPEAT. I wanna say fuck the youtbers saying this, thats bullshit they have shroom characters, liches, banshees, crabs etc.. lots of variety
*OVERWORLD (Really unique, to the Borderlandws Franchise, Very appealing, its basically DND but the overall feel is great to this new addition, Great side quests, Unlockables (Worth getting and grinding the Dopamine receptors that shoot through your brain when unlocking these are great)



CONS:
*THOUGHTS ABOUT ENDGAME Okay honestly I do believe the game can have a more adaptive endgame, maybe a better chaotic system, Just something to make this game more longer because i truly love this game, Maybe just more content
*MEELEE (TBH IN MY OPINION RESPECTFULLY, I dont really like meelee of any form in looters and shooters, its not terrible, but the aspect of it just really doesnt do it for me, there are certain classes that can benefit from it, But when your dealing with a hoard of enemies, the meelee swings and certain swing speeds of the meelee weapons can get you kiled very quickly. Not terrible but IMO just not a fan of it, and I find myself not using the meelee aspect of it so much.
*DLCS: AYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUCK THEM THEY SUCK BARELY 15 MINUTES OF DLC CONTENT NOT WORTH IT, ONLY GET IT IF ITS ON SALE, NOT WORTH NOT WORTH NOT WORTH

Anyways, games a bit meh just seems very boring at times, atleast things don't die as fast as in Borderlands 3, bosses (sometimes) feel like bosses, starting to feel like the more u play the easier it gets. 
90% of the encounters in the Overworld feel repetitive, side quests don't really make you want to do them, if anything just feel like obstacles in your way of doing what you want to do which is the main story. 
Map's are large, look nice, I'm at the point to where I don't even bother killing things anymore I just run past em unless I have to. Probably should've googled what secondary class to go for, cause I entirely screwed myself :D 
Spellcasting and summoning don't mix skill tree wise (wish I could've previewed them). So I guess my other skill tree is entirely useless until I complete the story that I'm most likely never going to want to replay. Overall, just feel like the games gonna be a grind fest the moment the stories over and kill my interest. Happy I'm only 11 hours in, but not looking forward to what comes afterwards.

Not very enjoyable, just something to mindlessly pass hours with, if you need something like that shoot for it, but please don't pay 60$ for this. A good 50% of my gameplay has just been running around the maps trying to get my luck up so that I atleast have the satisfaction of different animations while killing something.
The same items drop constantly, why I'm trying to get my luck up, first 6-8 hours of the game was just some 1 shot crossbow pistol and toxin infused buzz light year hand laser looking brzz rifle that you don't have to aim with. (Hopefully it wasn't just my rng having a stroke) 

Overall, I'd just say if you want a open world pew pew looter shooter, and it's on discount go right ahead.
However, be prepared to have a serious love hate relationship except the love is like 10% and the hate is just you wanting to get it over with so you feel like you got what u paid for. Genuine copium on my part,

So, you want to read a review of Borderlands game huh? Coming right up like pizza in a restaurant you’ve eaten quite many times. This time a Borderlands entry was only three months EGS exclusive and Randy has apparently been too focused on upcoming Borderlands movie-adaptation that there wasn’t such a PR-clusterfucks like we witnessed with Borderlands 3 so great improvement on that area!
It’s hard to come up big improvements over Borderlands 3. There’s still weapons with weakest recoil ever, making gunplay feel still quite boring. Mayhem mode is gone, replaced with random generated small roguelite expeditions. I’m a fan of said sub-genre but I still preferred Mayhem mode over these expeditions. And even when writing team had more freedom with this title due to DnD-session nature, I feel I laughed more on my seven hours Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep DLC than 18 hours with this game. As for change of spaceship to overworld traveling I’m not sure. While overworld is something new to quite stagnated Borderlands-franchise at this points, there’s no more vehicles to drive with, making moving with foot only option to move in this game.
As for rest changes/ additions with sub-glasses, re-roll of gun/ equipment bonuses, hand grenades replaced with spells my opinion of those is most simply phrased “eh” with no huge benefit felt during my playthrough over previous entries.

[h1]Verdict:[/h1]
Tiny Tina Wonderlands is small bits of new to Borderlands-franchise, which those whom are fine with franchise’s gameplay have a good time with. As for those who wished that after Borderlands 3 Gearbox would have taken lessons back from Borderlands 2 writing/ tone will likely still feel disappointed as with third installment of main Borderlands franchise.",1667678030,1667740141,True,1,0,0.438271611928939819,0,True,False,False

And in the wake of the latest update for this game, I’m redoing this review to be more negative. 3.5/10

In its defence, Wonderlands has the most beautiful maps and open world yet, with the most extensive diversity of playstyles and character customisation in the series so far. Enemy diversity is good, and the implementation of the new game mechanics is generally positive eg; cryo on bone, melee weapons, three pseudo-reli-artefact slots, dark magic healing and timed spells replacing grenades. The clarity in combat is good, unlike its predecessor's damage numbers and combined combat effects no longer obscure targets. Arenas, overworld elements and combat encounters are good, they reflect the world well and fit the fantasy theme. Sound design, music and voiced dialogue are good, a compliment I may not have given to BL3. The narrative is superior to Borderlands 3, its side quests are cute and display its tone and characters well, as a quality RPG should. 

This does not come without its drawbacks, however.  

[b]The grinding to Chaos 100 is immense, longer than entire playthroughs of the base game[/b], is repetitive and boring, lacking the gear reward and meaningful challenge for which the series is known, and the reward is a menial meaningless bump in the game's pathetic drop rate. In addition, since higher levels of chaos do not guarantee Chaotic/Volitile/Primordial/Ascended rolls on gear, meaning that farming high-quality gear is best left to going back into Chaos Chamber for more torture. No pearls, no Chaos exclusive weapons, no raid boss. What is the point in pretending that there is an endgame when the only activity there is the exact activity the player has done over a minimum of 60 times? There’s no game anymore, no point in playing, the fun dried up long before the final boss, and Gearbox has the gall to claim that this is entertainment. 

The difficulty is a serious issue that Gearbox needs to fix with the Borderlands franchise. Just because an enemy health-gates me on every one of its attacks, it doesn’t make it a meaningful challenge to fight it, because I’ve spent the entire duration of the game fighting identical enemies with the same methods. Mayhem and UVHM from the previous games changed the way you approached enemies, as Mayhem modifiers could be rerolled to your preferred playstyle(and with new mayhem legendaries to boot), or having the endgame balanced around slag/cryo and TVHM enemy variants. But Wonderlands ONLY has enemy health and damage scaling, with no new enemies, no whacky modifiers, no unique gear, and only offers the same repetitive challenge as its previous Chaos levels did with a new fancy number taped to it. The Chaos levels experience does not offer new fun to veteran players, it’s boring to execute and identical to lower levels of play with an even slower burn on gear farming. 

The equipment slot unlocks are too late in the game to change build crafting and I should not have to complete the story to get my ring slot. Overworld challenges and collectables should not be tied to stat progression, all that incentivises me to do is open up a guide for the game, and waste hours hunting down the boring filler content. All the opening hero point allotments need to be swappable and provide an equal amount of points each. The same goes for the starting skill tree. Atop this is the bland Myth Rank system, where each level beyond 40 provides a minuscule stat increase. It just doesn’t have the same appeal as Guardian ranks in BL3, where the skills earned tangibly impacted gameplay or the earned XP giving me rewards from the Vault Cards. On a side note, enemy density in Chaos Chamber and Overworld encounters feels really low, I’d rather have a barrage of enemies that lasts a short time, than have them too spaced out and have to hunt for them. At least having variety between the two would be nice. 

Wonderlands still has game bugs, with looping subtitles, random reflection flashes, poor streaming performance and menu numbers being broken. And as a more minor gripe, I hate the elemental puddles on the floor damaging you. I can deal with enemy ones, like the “Nasty Spill” modifier in the Chaos Chamber or barrels exploding, but if cryo Buffmeister activated in ankle-high water downs me one more time, I’m going back to Deep Rock Galactic. 

The DLC for Wonderlands has also proven to be disappointing overall, merely providing Chaos Chamber rooms, 15 minutes of progress each(x4), and a depressing wheel of misfortune, spitting out crap loot for all of your trouble. I’m not denying that the gear is good, but if I paid money for this and struggle to get any of these items to drop because they share the same loot table as the world drop system, I’d wish I hadn’t bought it too. [b]Buyers beware, players can safely skip this season pass, it provides no fun to this decrepit package.[/b] All for the same price as the 4 campaign DLC of BL3, or the Handsome Collection. 

In closing, the game is mired in the same problems the series has had since 2012, flawed endgame and unrealistically rare loot drops. But the package of this game is really nice, high fantasy is really cool, and the gameplay is on-par with BL3. I want what’s best for the series, I wouldn’t 100% the other games if I didn’t, but right now, this just isn’t healthy.

It will 80% only have 1 of your classes, and if you are playing in group 90% of time. The class gear will be for someone in your group. Now the Legendary rate has made the game better. But game is forcing social trade and interaction, that has always been part of the game. I thing its dumb, but it is something to look for socially. 

One of my main criticism of the game is the writing. I can appreciate each mission trying to be lore rich. But sometimes the NPC dialog goes on forever and take you away from the action. Having to pause and listen, to only then interact or follow a NPC really sucks when its dragged out. The jokes in this game is a joke. Maybe 1/5 jokes will stick, i know comedy is subjective. But even so, if you compare to Borderlands 2 (peak of BL comedy,) it doesn't even come close. 

Second main criticism is Connection and Group Chat. Constantly losing connection and when you try to reconnect through 
Social, it doesn't allow you to. Only fix is to restart your game by exiting to desktop. Now sound in a group, i recommend 3rd party chat, in game chat just randomly goes mute, other parts doesn't even recognize a microphone.",1667359308,1667359308,False,4,2,0.523192167282104492,0,True,False,False

1) LEVEL SCALING!!!!

No, no, no, no and no.   What's the point of having levels if it all scales with you? What's the point of getting that bit more powerful if the enemies do as well? Might as well just gut the RPG levels/stats and make it a shooter because at least it would be honest then.

2) All sidequests in the overworld take place in Quake arenas with random enemies and random maps.  It makes Skyrims Radiant AI quests look beautifully handcarved.

3) Ear bleeding jumping noises, melee noises,screaming noises, sprinting noises that you can't turn off.

4) Terrible Mythic system.  Remember how in Borderlands 3 you'd hit max level and then your XP went toward skill points you get spend in whatever you wanted?  Well this game has four classes, and the stupid mythic system won't let you spend it in the class you want,  it forces you to spent a point in all 3 other classes before you can spend the point in the one you want.  Worst.Dev.Design.Ever

5) There is an enchantment reroller on your gear.  Amazing eh? No. You only get access to it once you've completed the game and there's nothing left to do.  Monty Python level of dev design.

6) Almost every NPC is gay and the game is sure to go into great detail for you about their LGBTQosadiofgaksjdgsajkdg relationships.",1664662055,1667072672,False,10,1,0.537953615188598633,0,True,False,False
