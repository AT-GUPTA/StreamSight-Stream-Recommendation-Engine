To be explicit: i enjoy immensely playing this game, yet there are some aspects that prevented me from giving higher score.

I will no comment the combat system, nor the global balance of the game, others did it already and i am aligned with the feeling that ranged/magic seems overpowered compared to melee.

I will not comment neither the beauty of the game nor the building system, these are really really good.

I am a liitle disappointed by the lack of immersion. I played Valheim far too much, and i am missing this feeling of beeing alone in an hostile world :
- no atmospheric effect. You cant be wet or cold, you cant unexpectedly have your fow blocked by fog early in the day
- food is a bonus, not a must have: you get health bonus through your armor and most of the random encounters can be dealt without eating or drinking more. Tell that to a mosquito in Valheim...
- hunting is optionnal (no key ressource),  
- trees wont hit you, falls are very quickly managed with glider.
- foes wont attack you when you are in your base, even when a door is wide open
All these little things combined make me far less immersed than Valheim, and i do not have the feeling i need to survive this world

But...

But exploration is amazing
But the lore is already so rich
But the building system is so fabulous
But the shroud is so corrupted
But the ambiance is so sad, walking on the remains of a dying realm

That I am hooked, and will be for a long time.

Has a lot of uniqueness going for it, especially compared to recent survival/base-building/exploration style games. In a game as huge as enshrouded, its level of hand-craftedness as you go exploring around is unexpected to say the least. Its mechanics genuinely attempt to split off from other similar titles with its own feel, progression, and loop. Not to mention that the base building in this game is second to none in the 3D space. Only real negatives I have for it is that there is still an expected amount of jank in the game, and that I think dropping most of your stuff when you die isn't a good idea for a game like this. You can easily find yourself unable to reach your body because your tomb spawns on the wall of a cliff that you died to your death on, leaving you with basically no recourse for reclaiming it. The game is fairly difficultly tuned as it is, between the shroud and many of the enemies easily one-shotting you if you aren't decently well kitted out. I also think mining certain materials is far to slow and tedious, and that storage chests all need to be a lot more generous.

Enshrouded is incredibly surprising. I expected a Valheim clone with gliders, and ended up with a pretty engaging and charming 70ish hours worth of gameplay, with a mix of questing, building, farming etc. The game is fluid and enjoyable, and whilst the barrier to entry with building and combat is perhaps a little higher than some other titles, it's far from insurmountable.

There are a few things that I think could be improved. The building isn't perfect, specifically roof gables could do with some love, and a couple of the block types are a bit of a pain to farm. The combat feels a little weird at times too, namely dodges not having as many I-Frames as you'd expect, and parrying sometimes not triggering if you hit one in very tight timing. Base building is also not terribly important, there's no reason to build something aesthetically pleasing or well defended outside of your own desire to do so, as your base is never at threat. However, all of these minor complaints can quite easily be improved on.

Only a month after the early access release, Enshrouded is probably one of the most complete EA survival titles on the market, especially during something of a resurgence in the genre.

There are very few distinct enemy types, and you will find yourself killing the same ""bosses"" over and over.

I will try the game again after it leaves early access and update my review if necessary but as of right now, it's just not a fun experience unless you really love the base-building aspect (which has its own issues and needs tons of quality-of-life improvements).",1708833406,1708833406,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The movement is incredibly clunky, especially if you have both the glider and double jump unlocked. Often you will go to double jump and it will glider you, or vice versa. Seemingly you can only double jump on the upward move, as soon as you start to begin falling it's glider only. That is honestly just boring design if intentional.
It's also incredibly boring that the grappling hook is only ever for boring ass specific point traversal only. Too expensive to build an actual grappling system I suppose. Not that that's a good or acceptable excuse.

The crafting progression is really weird and annoying.
Wow I can craft all kinds of amazing metal and magic things, but it's a spindle to make cloth that I simply cannot make myself? Or a saw for a table? So ridiculous and frustrating. Just pointless and illogical gating.

The progression of enemies is absolutely insane and stupid too. You hit a wall in quests around level 7 where they start sending you to areas of level 11-13s for the next series of quests, but with no gear or abilities to fight those. Just became a lot of really boring kiting.

The level 13 enemies even when I came back at higher level were ludicrously stronger than the previous enemies. The power ramping is so boring and non existent. Levels do basically nothing, are incredibly slow and only really a few skills are worth picking up, most are boring 5% damage passives.
The arcane blink one and double jump are both great though. Everything else is a big fat bore.

All in all, 4/10. Do not recommend unless you've got money burning a hole in your pocket and a few hours to kill.",1708833365,1708833365,False,0,0,0.39682537317276001,0,True,False,True

Major issues early on and throughout the game are the enshrouded areas and the geographical funnel that is created all over the map to hold it. It means you cannot walk in a straight line anywhere. Over and over you will encounter un-scalable cliffs that will leave you in desperation pickaxing your way up mountains. It's a continual drag and you will get tired of it fairly fast.

Another terrible aspect of the game is the corpse runs. You drop items on death and will need to go back for your body. Now I know what you are thinking: that this is the usual for a open world survival game. Why yes! but in THIS game you can die to stupid things, bugs, glitching enemies, or overpowered enemies (more on that later). Now add to this the aforementioned geographical hellscape they have created and doing corpse runs is easily 5x worse than in other games. It gets old very fast. 

And finally what really seals the deal that this game is a true turd is the relative (level 25) end game. Enemies are 2-shotting me. All of them are. Melee is terrible. if you get touched by any enemy it will take 50% or more of your health. So melee in this game is plain too risky. Even magic builds have this routinely happening. Even with a 90% fleshed out tank tree the 2-shotting continues. And what makes this so much more craptastic is that the block mechanic fails over and over. You cannot in most cases cancel out VERY long animations to go into a block. If you do attempt to do this and hold down block the shield often never comes up even as you hold the button down. Keep in mind it takes two shots to kill you. You will die over and over holding down the block button and your character is running around doing nothing. It's terrible. 

The game has promise but I cannot see the developers walking back the combat mechanic decisions they made. It is simply  not enjoyable. You cannot really engage in block and attack mechanics in melee. You can use cheese builds and exploit bad  AI (pathing and so on) but that is not something I am interested in doing. In short the game changes drastically towards the end and there is no semblance of game balance. Trash mobs will 2 shot you and make your character feel weak as krap unless you run around and exploit pathing and use particular cheese builds.",1708829664,1708829664,False,5,0,0.517532646656036377,0,True,False,True

I'm a huge fan of voxel games and I got all my friends to pick this up because I was so excited but I'm honestly disappointed. I will be playing more of this but for new players I would probably wait unless you are playing by yourself.

The voxel & base building parts are the only things that are done well but are also lacking. While the voxel part is great, harvesting is boring and while base building is amazing it is also meaningless. You are allowed up to 20 flame altars eventually but that just means you got a bunch of teleporters because it isn't worth the investment in making them into a base.

The crafting system is needlessly convoluted with unique NPCs and crafting tables. The NPCs only being able to be at one location at a time makes multiple bases pointless. While you can summon them from base to base as needed this is part of the needlessly convoluted part. The NPC quests to unlock recipes is great though. 

The crafting system in this regard I know was made because the Devs wanted more of a community based thing but ended up stifling creativity. If one of the main points to the game is base building but you make it so your crafting can only be done by summoning a crafter seems needlessly counterproductive.

Combat is interesting for the first 10 hours then the extreme repetitiveness gets a bit much. Also, how do enemies have more melee animations than I do. I personally wouldn't care so much if all melee weapons didn't have the same 3 swings. I like what they did with the staff, wands are weird, and bow/arrow is as expected.

Exploration is probably one of the best things that this game offers but the community sharing in all the quests and teleports really make this a moot point. Why travel to the spire, or that town, cave, dungeon when someone else can unlock the nearest port or put down a base. I'm not a big fan of playing a game that the main players aren't me. 

Dead bodies - The best feature is dying near your friends and not having any idea what body is yours.

Loot - Non instanced loot isn't a deal breaker but is pretty standard nowadays and feels weird to not have when the main goal was community. There is supposed to be extra loot that drops from bosses & difficulty changes while in a group but I haven't really noticed either of these in an amount that promotes team play.

 Skill Tree - I don't have many issues with this other than go stamina, more stamina, and than more stamina and after that maybe get an unneeded dmg buff

Difficulty - It feels weird to be a lvl 7 with a lvl 3 hatchet killing lvl 13-15s.

In the end, The game is really good and really bad all at the same time. For me the bad outweigh the good and the unchanging vision stated by the devs in there latest post on their discord doesn't fill me with a lot of hope. I'll play a bit more and see if it can change my mind. I should really know better than to continue buying Early Access titles.

Edit - I have uninstalled and moved on to other games. While the building in the game is truly the best ever, everything else I have stated here is accurate.",1707965624,1708827416,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

That is because for the $29.99 I had a good 100 hours fun with it and I hope that Enshrouded has a bright future ahead with many fixes and enhancements to systems that feel more like a proof of concept then done mechanics.[/h3]


Among those negatives are:

The performance of the game is still atrocious. For some reason, when I run my GPU at 50% the game performs as good as if I run it at 100%, yet at 100% Enshrouded causes my GPU to run at max power and thus heat up quite significantly.

Combat feels [i]ok[/i] but could do with [i]allot[/i] of polish. Melee is ok at first, but becomes extremely repetitive with limited actions you can do. Archery fares allot better, I would say it is on par with Sorcery. The only issue with Archery is that you empty your quiver faster then you can fill it up again. Sorcery is power wise on par with Archery, but because of wands not using any ammo and [i]infinite spells[/i] for staffs you don't run into the same issue Archers do.

Base Building lacks incentive, for most of the game all you need is a basic shack you can create in the first hour. I also find the building system somewhat finicky, definitely needs more work.

Quests in Enshrouded play out one of two ways, either ""go to spot X and loot something"" with a few ""go to spot X and kill that enemy"".

The world of Enshrouded feels like randomly generated, with [b]allot[/b] small errors here and there.

The world-map is highly confusing, it fails to [i]easily[/i] show what part is an impassable vertical wall you can't climb and what is not.

Those ""Enshrouded"" areas, where the game places a time limit on you which encourages you to make haste. But then the fog in those areas can be super [b]thick[/b] and if it is daytime the sun can shine in a way thanks to bloom you can't turn off that you see as far as your outstretched arm. Add to that those ""red"" areas, where just dipping your toe eats away at the time you have inside those Enshrouded areas to the point where you near instantly die. If you're unlucky your gravestone then lands on an edge where you slide right back down into the red stuff again, unless you know how to use your pickaxe.
I died quite a few times because of the combo of bloom, tick fog and sometimes a slope which feels like dying to causes out of your reach.

I wish that ""red"" ground in the world would have [b]as big a glow[/b] as it has when you are within one of those ""Miasma Root"" areas. I never even died once to the red in those areas, but outside where it doesn't glow on multiple occasions.

Firstly, I have an AMD card, and visuals were buggy with the latest driver (had to downgrade), and I'm not convinced it's AMD's fault. Secondly, some parts of character movement and animations are pretty weak, especially dynamic movements like jumping/landing. Thirdly, the building system seems good, but it feels a bit like using a dev tool. Lastly, the performance is sketchy - there are weird degradations, for example it was running completely smooth, then I placed a door in my base and since then it's somewhat stuttery.

Something else to mention is that the fact that other 'flameborn' are basically static prop NPCs in your base definitely feels crude and cheap, and just generally annoying, in the sense that I'd strongly prefer a simple workbench instead. Hopefully with time they'll be developed into proper NPCs that can move and do things, and perhaps you could even request them to follow you and fight with you.

Also there are significant technical problems still unsolved: The game simply resets the entire environment every time you load, which means that all trees, chests, boxes, barrels, and every other prop, asset and resource are ""respawn"". Even my terrain modifications outside of the base zone were reset. I think the game simply does not save this state into the game save files, which certainly simplifies saving, but it's also a sign that the dev's still have to figure out how to efficiently/feasibly deal with environment and terrain state persistence.

Btw, if the devs fail to work on the game and post updates, I'll change this review to negative, because I'm fed up with that.",1708775682,1708817979,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Alright, so I would really like to thumb this up. I like a lot about this game and enjoyed my time with it. But there is one key feature in this game that completely ruins it for me:

The world is not persistent! This means, everything outside your own house gets reset when you ""save"" and quit and then ""continue"" later again. (Or also without even quitting but  just by  not being in an area for some time)

At first I couldn't believe it. I thougt sure, Enemies are going to respawn, and maybe trees and rocks too. But no! EVERYTHING gets reset. Nothing you do has any impact at all. Loot chests, terrain, animals, items, barrels, traps, enemies, decorations like carts or fences and all narrative elements down to the same chunks of raw meat laying on the floor in the same exact spot every time you step in front your base, which is the only area that you can actually leave an impact in, will just spawn back in. This is so ridiculously exploitable (especially with the quick travel options) its not even funny. I would love the game otherwise. And it wouldve been an easy fix by the devs imo but I cant seem to find any mention about this being a bug or a planned feature. And they have the tech to serialize and save areas of the world. So why not save it? It really makes me think this is just a stupid design decision.

Let me give you an example on how to get the best equipment (no exploration or sense of accomplishment needed) quick:
1. Find a location with a crate that has some nice gear inside
2. Place a flame altar closeby but not so close that the crate is inside its home area.
3. Go back to main menu and load back in.
4. Run the 10 meters to the crate and loot the new, random but also very valuable gear.
5. Repeat until you're maxed out and maybe repeat even more because you can also salvage what you dont need to upgrade your gear even more.

WTF?!

Now, obviously you could just say ""Alright then I will just not exploit it"" - But this is not so easy, especially since there is also no way to pause the game, not even in single-player! So if you gotta do something and have to leave the game for a few minutes? Either you stay in-game, which can be very risky or dumb or you do the obvious and quickly leave to the main menu to ""pause"" - But then you go back in-game to find everything has been reset. lol
Good Luck remembering what you've looted already and where you've missed something and resisting the urge to re-loot everything. Especially with everything looking the same.

Also - Why have this great voxel terrain and then not do anything beyond a slightly more advanced minecraft-y building system? There are mines now but when we are done mining in them and they get slightly too uncomfortable to mine in instead of having to come up with cool mining operations we just leave the area and come back later or reload the save and everything is back to normal and the mine is filled back up. This is so dumb. Valheim was able to make this so much more immersive. It's a shame.

Overall this just completely kills this game for me. It makes it feel very unfinished, unbalanced and generally negatively impacts motivation. I really hope they can make the world persistent. At least make it an option for hardcore players! Or at least make everything outside the shroud persistent!",1708195960,1708813186,False,8,1,0.516647577285766602,0,True,False,True

This is a game that is survival, but not brutal survival and it respects your time. Its an adventure game where the puzzles are just difficult enough to be satisfying to solve, but not difficult enough to frustrate you for long.
Its a building game that doesn't require you to farm for hours for materials for anything. Yes, you do have to go out and gather things but you don't have to grind and grind and grind like some of these games.
Craft from chest is available within the first few hours of gameplay and, as someone who has played a few survival games, this is a godsend. I won't be playing any survival games that don't have craft from chest or a mod that can provide that. (Looking at you Valheim.)
The combat is nothing special but it's nothing clunky or bad either. As a souls vet, the combat is pretty easy with moments of difficulty, but for someone who is not a souls vet, it will be quite challenging at times. Its a perfect fit for all the other aspects of this game.
Its a story game but you won't be overwhelmed with prose. Its not Witcher 3 or Horizen Zero Dawn but its got a lot more story than Dark Souls 3 or Elden Ring. 
Its an exploration game. And, no matter how much I explore, if I go back to a place, I will frequently find something I missed. A hidden door, a chest, branching passage, etc. I watched a friend streaming and he is in a tower I have been in many times, and between two traps you have to avoid,  there are two secret doors that open to chests. I have been trying to avoid the lightning traps and rolled right past them, never seeing them until his stream. While he was taking out a minor boss and about to leave, one he had killed many times, I told him about a chest he had missed behind the stairs.
(You may be wondering why we have been back to places many times - we play single life, so if we die, we start over.)
Everything about this game is well thought out, well designed, respects the player and is rarely frustrating in a way that makes you want to break your keyboard and mouse. 
On top of that, the glider and grappling hook are excellent additions to the gameplay. Both add a lot of fun. Nothing like jumping off a 200 meter tower in your flight suit and soaring around towards an objective.
There are some shortcomings but they are few. And it's early access.

Even in its early access stage, it stands as a solid game with the promise of much more to come. Building in the game is incredibly satisfying, thanks to its voxel-based nature, which allows for a high level of creativity. Blocks blend together seamlessly as you add or remove pieces. The game offers a plethora of items to craft, a wide variety of materials for building, enjoyable combat mechanics, and numerous skill trees for customization. It's easy to respec for different situations and adventures; for example, you can switch to a build that benefits exploration and resource harvesting, then switch to a combat-focused build when you're ready for a fight.

While the game supports co-op play, I have played entirely solo and still thoroughly enjoy it. However, I can only imagine how much better it would be with friends. As you progress, you can have up to eight bases, and the map is vast. Personally, I usually prefer to focus on building and resource gathering in games like this, occasionally joining others for adventures. This game rewards you with experience for activities outside of combat, so you'll feel like you're progressing even if you're not engaging in battles.

In my approximately 100 hours of playtime, I have only reached level 15, dedicating much of my time to building my village. The game allows you to manipulate terrain, letting you tunnel underground or add land blocks above ground to create hills and other structures, similar to Minecraft. It feels like a wonderful blend of a Minecraft-style game with RPG elements. Combat is challenging and enjoyable; I've died many times, but it adds to the thrill of choosing which fights to engage in, which to avoid, and how I can improve.

Overall, I would genuinely give this game a score of 10/10. I am excited to see where it goes as it continues to develop.

We had SO much fun.  The game is tuned nicely outside some weird texture oddities from time to time.  Combat isn't Elden Ring, but the exploration sure as heck is.  Maybe even more to explore with surprise chests, rascals and various other niceties to thank folks who like checking corners and off the beaten path.

It is exactly what the gaming community needs amid a world of games that coddle you like babies  and target your addictions and weaknesses to peddle micro transactions.  This is not one of those games.  You will have to try hard.  You will have to face your fear.  You will have to explore and build.  And you will be rewarded.

The environment is surreal.  The darkness at night or in a cave will actually scare you, get your hear rate increasing, and make you jump.  Better hope that torch doesn't expire until you are safe.  And that is just one example.  The build system is not overly complex, restricted, and solely a numbers game causing you to pursue the meta.  You are free to combine different types of builds to your liking and still be successful.  The survival aspect is great also.  Nothing is given to you for free.  You must explore to acquire the things you need.  The crafted items are not only good, but critical.  The building system is not just for show.  It is actually important to your character's survival!  No ""houses"" that merely serve as containers for that pretty stuff they made you pay real money for.  On the contrary,  working hard to build a comfortable home with hand crafted furniture actually makes you stronger!

Of course, no game can completely cover every detail.  There is always something more that could be done.  There are things that could be better and things that you wish were bigger and just had more and more detail, because the detail already there is so good that you want more.

Combat is NOT good, really clunky. The talent tree is filled mostly with mediocre upgrades that don't make you feel more powerful, which is a weird mix with the slow/grindy progression. You gain 90% of your ""power"" from getting new weapons or armor, making talents seem pretty pointless. 

Graphics? Also don't be fooled by reviews - they are decent at best. Remember, this is different than ""Does the game look good?"" Because yes, at face value it looks good. But there are no good particle effects, model movements are clunky, swordplay, spells, etc. are all lacking. Don't get me started on bloom effects, my God. Google that.

- Gameplay 8/10
- Story 4/10
- Immersion 6/10
- Graphics 7/10

The game intro starts great > it throws you into the world ; BUT here comes the problems : 
1.- Story is non-existent has no guidance or immersion whatsoever are just randomlocations objects throw not even thought out on distance or zone you need to travel ; like a level 3 quest is at level 13 area half way around the world map , etc > That make you collect 1 to reveal another and so on for more information ; it has no meaning or existential goal on the Story or Progression 
2.- The world feels empty and repeatable same monsters same progression from level 1 to level 10+ monsters mid-map all revealed & explored and a few towers conquered 
3.- To many puzzles to little meaning > it adds so many puzzles and complexion on the map that makes the game tiring and less fun or engaging with the player it actually detaches the player from the game becoming a Grind simulator of side-quest objectives 
4.- No Voice or story guidance as mention above you have no idea what to do you just explore left and right and discover stuff by READING 1 note at each location for more information and other locations reveal > that will make you travel back and forth to your unlocked Summoned NPC you find on the maps
5.- It feels like an Outward but lower quality on the GOAL of the game and objective focus ; i had to read 2 hours on why the CLAY is non-existent only in level 15-20 area zone that is required for early level 3-5 IMPORTANT PROGRESSION MATERIALS for Kiln 
6.- Mortar again non-existent requires you to travel 60% entire game map exploration to reach level 16+ enemies as level 5 to unlock the Mortar for the Alchemist NPC you unlock ... its just randomly stuff placed with no meaning it feels not even Alpha ... PRE-Alpha

The crafting system is amazing but this game needs a climbing function. Im so tired of having to glide down into random shroud spots and getting killed by random little patches of Red shroud. You could remove the shroud completely from this game and it would still play very well. Making it an open exploration but gating the exploration behind extremely unneeded methods of traversal is extremely annoying. This game would be a 5 outta 5 with a climbing function but right now this map is killing the game for me severely. As a solo player its pretty unforgiveable for no reason. Its a bad design where the best way to fight mobs is to just jump up to a cliff and just chunk them down with a wand. Im tired of aimlessly walking to the checkpoint marker to find its on the cliff above. Im tired of needing to youtube routes when the game could easily just display Roads or ANY indicator of where things are actually located. Id prefer even just info in the quest text.

Graphics are beautiful for a early access. Some issues for my computer when I fast travel but that's on my computer and not the game. Story is decent. You pick up plot points along the way much like a souls game but piecing them together is pretty easy. The game is like a souls like survivor style game so it really fits a niche that I have been hoping for in many games.  From exploring to building your own town there are countless hours that can keep you busy and interested. It should be noted that only parts of the map is unlocked for playing. The area they give you is very open-world and large enough to compete with many games even though  you are only getting less than 1/3 of the full game map.

Coming from Palworld, using a similar dedicated server setup in Enshrouded was a horrible experience.  I'm an IT network engineer by trade and even I couldn't reliably get into my own dedicated server or have friends join it.  The fact that the game client won't allow you to specify and connect to a server via it's IP or hostname is a huge detractor.  That's a basic networking/game design staple, and it's mysteriously missing from Enshrouded.  The software currently relies on having your dedicated server listed by Keen's game server list, and that doesn't seem to work properly.  Ever.  There's supposed to be a workaround to add the game server to your favorites in steam:

open Steam and go to View > Game Servers.

Make sure you have favorites selected, and press +
Then enter the server IP and port.

This process worked for me once.  I ran a server all night, shut it down, and when I restarted it, it never worked again.  No settings were changed.

Combat is so watered down that it makes some builds completely useless (sorry tanks and healers), and makes group combat pretty pointless. Building with no foundation support, no rounded pieces, and blocks just feels like a throwback to Minecraft. Crafting is frustrating just trying to remember what bench makes what - Why not add the recipes to the actual crafter, rather than benches when we unlock them? Some resources absolutely need rebalancing (wtf am I supposed to do with all this torn cloth?). But what really grinds my gears is that the whole point of the game (clear the shroud, restore Embervale) is rendered entirely moot by the fact that you can't actually do this! Building areas are limited on the premise that you need a flame altar to protect you from the shroud, but building near the shroud doesn't clear it, allow you to build there, nor does it protect you. So we only get so many building spots because we need a flame altar that seemingly does nothing at all? Same goes for Elixer Wells - ""Clear the well to clear the shroud!"" Nope. Only the smallest area, just enough to fast travel out, and it respawns! It's a giant mess of ideas that nobody even bothered to check if they worked together.

Enshrouded to me feels like if Valheim and Fable had a baby and the parents had a 3rd cousin named Elden Ring. 
It's NOT a grindy hardcore ""survival"" game, but to me GOOD FOR THAT.
It's open world, play it how you want, with fleshed out rpg stories and quests. 
Multiplayer works very well but people need to realize it is a CO-OP experience.
Yes you can build your own bases, but limits are shared because it's supposed to be a CO-OP experience. You are not random criminals like Conan Exiles. You are not trying to prove your individual worthiness like Valheim. 
Please do not complain this game isn't like every other ""survival"" game then complain the industry is stale.it's NOT a survival game. It's more of a open world building action rpg sandbox.

But as I pressed on I found myself wanting to progress to the next area.
By the next moment, I realised I was hooked compared to other games of this type, I found this the most fun to play.
The RPG aspect of the game is still a little shallow but still is fun, the attacking feels real good and fun!

There is still a lot of improvements for this game to be made, but I am here for it I would love to see what they do in the upcoming releases of this game.

Some things I would like to see.

For planting its great having loads of cooking/planting options, but I would like there to be an easier way to lay out plants. I found the task of planting hundreds of seeds very tedious. So if there was an unlock for a seed scatter tool to plant multiple plants in a uniform way with less effort would be amazing.

Mobs Ai needs work, it was very easy to cheese bosses/farm mobs down to stupid Ai I know I didnt have to cheese them but still would be nice if it wasn't possible.

Double jump should not be a skill, there was many places I could not imagine how someone would climb without it, I am glad I picked this skill up but I do feel it is essential which shouldn't be an unlock.

And of course the usual more things to craft/more enemy types etc but as it stands I feel I have already got my moneys worth and look forward to playing it more soon.

Enshrouded has so much much potential, meaning more room to improve in. This is a positive review and I hope the dev people will consider.

Your characters are given the chance at the start of the game to freely choose between being a fighter/tank/mage or a combination of all. Although that sounds great, it plateaus pretty quickly, WHY?

1. Attack base movement/skills using different types of weapons are mostly the same animation. I think having separate animation for the different categories of weapons would be a great element to the game. for example you're playing as a mage and there are so many types of wands/staffs and have different elements however, all the items have the same animation even if you're equipped with a different staff.

Suggested animation:
common/uncommon Items - same animation
Epic Items - Different animation
Legendary - Different animation for each item

2. Clothing.
- I'm sure this is an all gender neutral game. having clothing sets with a male and female design would rock. 

3. Story-line
- I don't know about the others, but I am so focused on getting all the NPC's required stuff that I can't even follow the storyline. I just think that enshrouded is not such a friendly story telling game because with all the separate/lost stories being found as you complete different quests, for different NPCs, make it kind of confusing to follow. I just know we got to beat the SHROUD. haha and not a fan of READING and playing, maybe try a NARRATOR option, would be great. 

4. Building
- Very easy to get creative, resources are abundant.

5. Map
- I hope you put in the option to rename markers in your map. 
- The map gets pretty busy and it's just not eye catching for users. I think the in game markers really only need to be the missions, in-game camps but for mines and cave-shortcuts, ETC, is better flashed on the screen as they enter and let the players mark their own findings like sources, mines, giving them control of their map. Which is more engaging. 


All in all game is great, recommended.

Game is in Early Access but is quite large as it currently stands. When you wonder if you are getting close to the end, you stumble on another area that is even larger than the area you already completed. 


Building: is fun and expansive. Has small quests to clear small areas to gain new materials to build with. Always new machines to gather to gain further access to new materials and equipment. 

Combat: Fun and tons of enemies. Has a large character building leveling system with improvements you can see and feel. Has boss fights near required to advance and elective boss fights. All are different and fun, expose combat areas and leveling issues you may have in your build.  

Leveling: Character leveling has a large tree that goes many directions to level many attributes and skills. The base world leveling is done through the flame shrine. Higher flame levels will unlock new areas that are otherwise covered in whats called ""deadly shroud"", a near insta kill environmental effect. 

Quests: Actually feels good for what i believed to be more of a building game. Quests are interactive and will show you where to go through a Journal menu and cursor guides. 

* I personally do not play on servers with other people I do not know. I play more for a PvE exp so can't comment on the PvP. Can host your own server on your own PC or rent one through GPortal, though they may be out of stock.

First off, I must say that I am not a fan of Souls-esque games. No disrespect intended, just not my thing. Regardless, Enshrouded was so good, it made me keep trying, and dying, over and over again until I had explored the entire map and completed everything this early access version had to offer. Can't wait for the full game to come out. 

My only real complaints are these:

1. The boss fight against the Wyvrn in the Pike. Why did my mage need to drag a bow out of the stash to stun lock the boss? Seems silly that a well placed staff blast won't work. 
2. The range on the wands is abysmal. I would love to have a counter to see just how many times I fired my wand at an enemy only to have them be just slightly out of range. Truly maddening. 
3. On that same vein, there is a really strange issue with the wands where it seems to be impossible to target the closest enemy. Seems like if there are multiple enemies coming at me, my mage will always target the furthest one, who is out of range of course, and completely ignore the closest. Almost to an absurd degree. My projectiles would curve around the immediate threats and then disappear before actually coming in contact with anyone.

It's not really a survival game, it's more about discovery, at least for me. I don't know if I've ever played something that gives me so many ""Squirrel!"" moments... as I head to one objective a half dozen other interesting caves, ruins and landmarks call out for exploration.

Although the game is fairly complete for early access, the skill tree needs quite a bit of work still in terms of making all the class trees playable. Magic is quite OP compared to the other trees, and since I play with my Archmage buddy, my main purpose as melee/bow has been to kite unsuspecting mobs to my caster friend so he can (most often) one-shot them.

I played for weeks without crashes, but now I have an issue with scrolling the map that causes crashing pretty consistently. Checking my files hasn't helped. As long as I stay out of the map the game is pretty stable. The map is a bit frustrating anyhow as I can't actually add text labels, which I hope to see in the game soon. Signs for storage chests would also be helpful.

The crafting system is enjoyable, but it does get confusing to figure out where to go to craft something when that particular item has to be made in one of a dozen different (and sometimes not intuitive) locations in my base. You'll also find that if you don't craft at least one of most things, recipes may be hidden from you until you do.

Being able to modify terrain adds a great deal of enjoyment and sometimes strategy to the game. If there's a cliff wall in my way and I want up it enough, my trusty pick (and my backup pick!) can get me there. My base is built next to a hill I hollowed out and built a ""secret"" cave in... And of course it's fun to be able to take over existing structures and modify those as well.

The gameplay basically centers around three interconnected systems; exploration, crafting, and combat. You must explore to find materials and combat encounters, you must craft to assist with exploration and bolster your combat abilities, and you must pursue high-level combat encounters to find rarer materials and enable further exploration. Putting in work on any one of these systems is always setting you up for the other two, you typically never feel like your time is being wasted which is a hard balance to strike. None of these systems are best-of-class but taken together make a very fun experience.

Combat is serviceable and can be quite fun, but is the least fleshed-out of the three systems. It is very easy to cheese by abusing the enemy AI when using ranged, and enemy variety is somewhat lacking. When new enemies are introduced it is consistently fun to figure out their attack patterns and what types of damage they are susceptible to, but ultimately everything starts to blend together after a while, nothing close to the complexity or difficulty of the souls-like or Zelda-like combat that it is aping. The shroud mechanic really helps in this regard, as the ticking-clock adds some tension where it otherwise may not exist.

Crafting is well designed, it rarely feels grindy and pushes you to explore the unknown. You rescue NPCs that later join you at your base, these NPCs acts as crafting stations as well as handing out a variety of quests that typically involve finding items they can use to improve their crafting skills or help you explore new areas. The base-building tools at your disposal are probably my favorite of any survival/crafting game, I could spend hours just making castles and dungeons and farms, I would love to see a creative mode in the future.

Exploration is the driving force of the game, the use of a hand-crafted world instead of procedural generation really sets it apart from other games of this type. Lots of memorable locations and interesting lore to discover, and generally just chill vibes running around a fantasy world. Generally if you see a structure in the distance you can find your way to it and discover something useful, though there are a handful of massive structures near the edges of the map that currently serve no purpose but may in the future. There are a handful of fast-travel towers you'll seek out throughout the course of the game that require solving a series of puzzles to reach the top and activate, nothing incredible about them but I always love a good puzzle dungeon.

The RPG skill-trees mostly consist of various buffs with an occasional unique ability further up each skill tree (sneak attack, double jump, special melee attacks, etc). Some skill trees just aren't going to have much utility as a solo player but you really can't go wrong with any of them anyway, they're not impactful enough where a bad build ends up screwing you over. There are ""survival mechanics"" which really just consists of needing to eat food sometimes and not hanging out in the shroud too long.

TL;DR Overall this was a great solo experience and is likely even more fun co-op. Surprisingly polished for an early access title as well, enough that it stands out in a market flooded with survival/crafting/RPG games. Expect extremely chill vibes interspersed with the occasional sphincter-clenching dungeon crawl. $30 for the current product is a fair value, I look forward to future content additions.",1708737112,1708737112,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

No game has ever done it as well as this game has and its only early access! I would appreciate being able to gain xp by building as thats how i spend most of my time. However the adventure and exploring in the game are also excellent! I am excited to see how this game evolves!

Things about this game that i truly appreciate.

1. Magic Boxes(resources can be pulled from these when crafting) I do wish this extended to building but not a big loss.
2.Fast Travel and Gliders, Getting around this map is a breeze and is very enjoyable. I highly recommend the double jump and glider upgrade.
3. Base building is a dream. The tools are fantastic and fun to use! Also its awesome that you can use and edit preexisting buildings in the world for your bases. 
4. Wall mounted trophies. It is fun to fight and obtain the heads of the beasts in the world and create better and better trophies.
5. There a ton of QoL additions in this game and you can tell the devs created a game they would like to play.

Is it perfect?  Hell no!  It's early access, ffs!

But is it worth your $$$?  I sure think so!

Solo, with a small group of 2, or on a dedicated server with 16 players, I am having FUN with this game!

I enjoy that you don't have to start out as a newb or even have to re-do each mission every time you check out a new server.  At least, presently, you can choose to create a new character or just jump into any server you want and check out the community with your existing character.  I love this, as you can team up with friends and new players alike for tackling something in a group and not worry about being a newb-weakling.

I love how easy and affordable it is to respec, so as to try out different builds!

I love how there are no ""set bonuses"" so you're not penalized for trying out different pieces of gear to better match your current build and play style!

I can always find something to do in-game, whether it's focusing on the story and lore, the missions, exploration, farming for resources/gear, or helping a friend with what they're currently working on.

The ""feedback board"" is a great place to upvote and comment on things you'd like to see in the game.

Yes, you can change your build anytime at the cost of 10 easily acquired runes, allowing you to experiment with builds without having to restart a full game.

To be honest, once you learn the attacking patterns of the various enemies you can easily deal with them.

Building is great, however right now there is no reason to build a base with any other material than the first type you discover. Maybe it will be useful later.

Crafting features will unlock as you get quests and fulfill them.

At the time of this review you can 100% the game in about 75 hours without rushing. On a side note I had to revisit all discovered flame shrines because there is actually no indicator to show which one you actually interacted with to get the achievements.

I am really curious about what will come next for Enshrouded, in its current state I recommend it.",1708725210,1708725210,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm just an old guy that games, but to truly see the forethought, planning and development that was put into the game my opinion is that you forego watching any videos, grab a friend (or go solo like I did) and start at the beginning... with the first quest and leave no part of the map unexplored.
Your map starts out as gray/grey and you should make sure that you explore every area that you can survive in, you will be rewarded for doing so!

For me, games you can 

1. Play single player
2. Play offline
3. Has no battlepass
4. Has NO microtransactions

Will always instantly get a positive bonus from me.  So tired of investor owned companies making games SOLEY for profit and not for making an honest living while providing an enjoyable entertainment experience for its customers/players, which is where the fair trade is.  I know there's always people happy to defend their table scraps, but I miss the days where making a living while making something that you are passionate about made most people in the equation happy. 

[h1]Pros[/h1]

[h2]Base Building[/h2] Honestly one of the best I've see so far.  It makes me actually want to build something more than just a box for shelter.  

If you are used to other survival games, you might find it confusing at first, since you make 100 blocks per unit made, and they don't mean 100 full foundations (walls, ceilings, etc), they mean 100 little blocks (think bricks) that make up the different structures and you need so many to make each structure.  You can overlap the structures blueprint over an already built structure and only build partials that use less of the blocks than a full structural unit would require.  You also have options of smaller sizes of structure to use.  Once I figured this out, I got to REALLY love this.  You have options to overlap and options for size of blocks, and it gives so much freedom to build whatever you can dream up.

If you want to build, it also encourages exploration since you have to venture forth to find the different types of materials/structures you would like to build with.

[h2]Zelda Inspired[/h2] 
You have very zelda-like puzzles/towers to do and that's not a bad thing, especially if you like Zelda type games.  They aren't super complex, but can be challenging to those who might be reflex-challenged.  If you don't care for the Zelda style, you might not enjoy this portion of the game.

[h2]Creative Exploration[/h2]
You are given multiple means of getting to places.  Jump, run around, build, mine.  It's up to you to find a way to get to where you are going.  There are only a few places where you are limited in how you can traverse the map

[h2]Large Map[/h2]
This might be a con to some, but it's a big map.  If you enjoy running around and exploring things, you'll like this map.

[h1]Cons[/h1]

[h2]Character Models[/h2]
I know this is a bit picky, and not the end of the world, but the character models are a bit wonky and weird looking.  Also (and I'm sure this will change) your character name doesn't show for others.  It doesn't really effect game play, but it can be distracting.

[h2]Inventory Management[/h2]
In the beginning it's not too bad, but as you quest, the amount of stuff you need to collect for crafting requirement to progress you armor, your abilities, your ammo, and your base can get pretty large.  The boxes are tiny in comparison and you end up littering them everywhere.

If they can clean this up and provide nice, very large storage containers mid game where it really starts to become a problem, particularly room specific (fridge or cupboards for kitchen, etc), that would be great.

[h2]Crafting gets tedious[/h2]
Not only do you need more of the base ingredients (lots of mining, tree chopping, etc) that doesn't give you much more base components, if any more, with better tools, but when you put them in the crafting stations, some of them take quite a while in real world minutes to finish each step of making an ingredient, and if you aren't on a persistent server, it all stops when you log off.

The challenge is striking the balance where you feel like it does something, while also feels quick enough that it's not frustrating to the player to go through so many real world minutes and have little to show for it at the end.

This can be particularly painful if you are playing solo, as you will be the only one going out to harvest everything by yourself.

[h2]Foes are both too smart and dumb at the same time[/h2]

You can tell the computer knows EXACTLY where you are with the archers, as they can hit you in positions they should NOT be able to see you or reach you.  You wouldn't be able to reach them, or know where they when the roles are reversed.  

I've also had a ring-around-the-rosy with some foes when I was jumping around to get a better position, and even in cases where it shouldn't have been able to see me move, the computer KNEW I moved, and immediately moved the foe opposite of me and under something where it couldn't be reached with arrows.

I guess I've gotten used to monster AI that acted a little more like something making real life decisions and mistakes rather than just being all knowing.

That being said, I've had obese matrons walk through doors that they shouldn't fit through, and up walls like it was just a slight incline they were having a nice stroll on.

[h2]Wand Targeting[/h2]
This one drives me bonkers.  I'll have something attacking me that is right in front of me but my wand will randomly decide to target something off in the distance that it can't even hit.  Not only does that leave me open to be destroyed by the biggest threat, it runs down my wand unnecessarily until it breaks.  It'll also randomly change to other targets.  I've tried manually changing targets, but this has been a persistent problem.  I don't like locking targets, normally, but I do want it to at least hit what is right in front of me trying to kill me.

[h2]Poison Damage is OP[/h2]

As of now, poison damage is OP for both enemies and mage players.  While it might be fun one-shotting things with your poison build mage, it's not so fun being one-shotted by Matrons poison spray, or when they blow up.  While I am not playing a mage, I've seen other people that play WITH them complain that they can't get a hit in on a fight.

[h1]Summary[/h1]

Overall, I'd recommend playing this game if you like building and exploring. I'm pretty impressed with what Keen have done so far, especially with the building system.  

I know the cons seem more than the positives, but don't let that deter you.  Most of the negatives revolve around the developers just needing to fine-tune and find the right balance for everything from fighting to harvesting to crafting to storage so that it is challenging but not tedious.  Sure, there are bugs and technical issues, but honestly, this is more polished than a lot of other games that have been released.  

I've read that what you get now is only a small portion of the full game.  I'm looking forward to the rest of what Keen releases.  Great job, Keen!  I love seeing smaller developers with passion put out fun games, and most likely are gamers themselves.

But i won't indulge too much in comparisons with Valheim, because there'd be a million to do. Some things Valheim does better, while Enshrouded is better at others. I will leave it at that and say that Enshrouded is very much it's own game. Like similar titles, it is a cocktail of sorts: it combines elements from Valheim, Terraria and V-Rising, but has quite the unique identity.

The building and skill tree system are perhaps it's most praise-worthy elements: building stuff and modifying it, especially after you've placed a ton of placeables, has never been smoother, and the numerous ways in which you can develop a character are a very strong incentive to try out more, even after you've built yourself a huge base and explored everything.

Combat (i only tried melee so far) is funny thanks to the presence of a few special moves, and in the way it encourages you to be aggressive while being mindful of sudden enemy counterattacks, at the same time letting you parry at any point during the attack animation, which is something i had grown completely unaccustomed to.

The world is not procedural, which as a choice is just as valid. It is gorgeous and you're often in elevated places, making for some truly spectacular vistas. 
My gripe with it is that it's very small and carefully structured, and feels padded in the way it often resorts to elements like massive charms that can only be entered and exited in a few places, and high mountains that have only one path to the top, forcing you to do a sometimes frustrating amount of pathfinding.
Everything is very packed and efficient, and the way you are railroaded kills any feeling of being in a vast, mysterious and wild world. It feels more like you're at an amusement park. An amusement park where fast travel is plentiful to the point that it becomes pointless beyond personal preference to build anything other than the main base. You're better off just planting fast travels on existing buildings, which already have high comfort rating.

Graphics wise the game looks good of course, with the current gen and stuff. The problem i have is the main character having the physicality of a scrawny boy (or a fat-headed pygmy). I mean this is clearly a game for the younger crowd but even them prefer playing heroes that look like, well, heroes. Hopefully more body type options will become available in the future.

If i had to find a main flaw in this game, is that it's easy. God how easy it is sometimes. I was never a Soulsborne person but as someone who played Ninja Gaiden 2 a hundred years ago, some of the bosses were almost offensively easy. I got more adrenaline fighting certain packs of mobs. I can see that being a huge turn off for some.

Enshrouded is one such gem that has not only captured my attention but has also firmly held it, making me eagerly log back in for more. Here's why I believe Enshrouded is a must-play for gamers of all stripes.

From the moment I launched Enshrouded, I was greeted with an immersive world that felt alive and pulsating with mystery. The game's storyline is compelling, drawing you in with its rich narrative and complex characters that are as enigmatic as the world they inhabit. It's a story that unfolds with each quest, keeping you on the edge of your seat as you piece together the lore of this beautifully crafted universe.

The gameplay mechanics are another area where Enshrouded shines. Whether you're a fan of strategic combat, exploration, or puzzle-solving, there's something here for everyone. The combat is fluid and satisfying, with a variety of skills and abilities that can be tailored to suit your playstyle. Exploration is rewarded with breathtaking vistas and hidden secrets that add depth to the game's lore. The puzzles are cleverly designed, challenging enough to be satisfying but never feeling unfair.

Graphically, Enshrouded is a feast for the eyes. The art style is unique, with environments that are both eerie and beautiful. The attention to detail in the world's design is apparent, making every location memorable and worth exploring. The soundtrack deserves special mention as well; it's hauntingly beautiful, perfectly complementing the game's atmosphere and enhancing the overall experience.

But what truly sets Enshrouded apart is its community and developers. The developers are actively engaged with the community, listening to feedback and continuously working to improve the game. It's clear they are passionate about their creation, and it shows in the quality of the game. The community is welcoming and helpful, making it easy for newcomers to get into the game and find their footing.

In conclusion, Enshrouded is a masterpiece that has thoroughly impressed me. It's a game that offers a deep, engaging experience that's both challenging and rewarding. Whether you're a casual gamer like myself or a seasoned veteran, Enshrouded has something to offer. It's a game I wholeheartedly recommend, and I can't wait to see where the journey takes me next.",1708715392,1708715392,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game has some other factors that make it quite amazing
[list]
   [*]Combat is quite fluid, but feels like it has impact, every attack you deal has meaning.
   [*]Survival elements don't necessarily mean that you're fighting your hunger bar. Instead it's to maintain buffs and ease exploration.
   [*]Talent tree isn't extensive, and does not have much impact, besides the major nodes that completely changes how your character works. (get double jump ASAP)
   [*]And lastly the building system. This game as of right now, only touts it's building system that no other survival game is on par with. Most building games have landscape that juts through your buildings. Or maybe your building juts through the landscape. Either way you can't change the fact that maybe your house may end up tilted, or there's this pesky rock that you can't remove. You can in this game, in fact you can reshape the entire landscape to your liking. Build extensive castles, or miniature cities, within your city. Build towering spires straight out of Assassins Creed, or a replica of the eye of Sauron. Whatever you choose to do with your character, will not have as much impact as the building.

[b]This is VERY nice Game![/b]

Yeah i know...
It is Early Access and it is a Self-Made Engine but there are some Minor missing things!

Building Systems feels a bit clunky.
This definitely need a ""Build Mode Camera"" function like No Mans's Sky have!
This maybe would make the Building System more smooth?

Plating Crops also needs a better way to get planted.
I know the planting system is very similar to many other games, but planting crops often lacks creativity and efficiency in most games too!

Performance is also a bit weird sometimes!
There are Framedrops on totally empty Places but max FPS in high Populated or Building Areas sometimes?!

But...
Almost almost everything is really very good!
Almost unbeleaveable compared to other games this times!

This game is incredibly good, but I didn't expect it to be THAT GOOD.

The good:

- Survival + crafting + coop + RPG + a tiny bit of a souls-like touch <3
- Game looks good and runs well (didn't notice any framerate drops at all)
- The enshrouded areas mecanic is just brilliant. Won't explain why here, just play :) 
- Game feels really good to play, controls are snappy, animations are satisfying
- The procedural generation is just STUNNING. Excellent work.
- The quest variety and amount of things to do is already huge, despite the game still being in early access at the time of this review
- Awesome skill tree, a lot of possible builds!
- Netcode feels on point, never had any lag or desyncs even during extented sessions

The less good (Not much to say here to be honest):
- Game feels stable, but a single crash will force you to hard reboot your PC (happened every single time, on all 3 setups I have)
- Slope climbing can sometimes be very wonky and frustrating, feels kinda buggy (you might start randomly slipping down a slope while at full stamina)
- Crafting could use some UX improvements. Right now there's too many different crafting menus (Handcraft/Workbench/NPC). But it's really nitpicking at this point. Please keep it like this, I'm fine with it :)
- Inventory management can get tedious, better sorting of chests and ability to label them would be great in the future
- No Steam deck support (yet, at least)

Overall, solid 16/20 (leaving room for more points for further updates)

So far:

+ Amazing world, I personally love the lighting, the vibe, it's not top tier graphics but it's really beautiful and has its own vibe, which I love.
+ Combat system so far is great, tested full mage, archer and tank, I like how you can go into other branches or completely reset your skill if you don't like something
+ Crafting can be a bit confusing at first but once you get the hang of it, it's really easy. It takes a lot of time for some stuff to be crafted and I hope in the future, the crafting stations can also use whatever is in your shared chests!
+ DESTROY. EVERYTHING. MINE THROUGH MOUTAIN. CLIMB TOP MOUNTAIN. BUILD TOWER ON TOP OF MOUTAIN. FLY ABOVE MOUNTAIN. ME HAPPY. WEEEEEE
+ The building system is amazing. It's not perfect, but I'm definitely enjoying it and I love all of the available options. Videos about crafted towns/villages are really cool to watch.
+ I love the shroud system. It took me and my friend a while to understand how it works and we died repeatedly at some point to get to a banshee monster because we thought we lacked an item or something to make us survive when all we had to do was upgrade the flame. Before realizing that, we loved finding ways to go around it or above it. The fact that you CAN cheat your way with patience & creativity is great.
+ The night atmosphere is great, though it can get really dark, I actually... like it.
+ Big map. To me it feels massive. I really enjoy walking around and finding new paths.
+ Some monsters (idk their name in English, the banshee-like ones) have amazing SFX. The scream when they die is oddly very satisfying. Weird point to add but I love it so much I had to mention it.
+ I actually enjoy the progress being tied up to the world.


-/+ The wyvern in the city is hella hard when you're a squishy mage. If you're a wand user then simply give up it's pointless, and a mage is gonna struggle because if how squishy they are. Though because of that, I asked a friend to come and help (after that, we kept playing together). I died 5 times in less than a minute, before asking for help. I was convinced it was a difficult boss and before we went in again, we actually got some bombs and destroyed the castle wall to secure a path from which we could escape in case things were going downhill. The fact that we COULD plan routes for an escape and build/destroy things around made the experience much better.

- As of now, the highest tier of gear made me grind for 8 hours straight doing the same thing over and over again by planting then gathering then crafting into another thing into another thing. Hundreds of flax seeds were planted repeatedly for 2 different gearsets. If it gets worse for higher gear pieces, I'm gonna go nuts. We need something or some NPC to automatize at some point. Because during these 8 hours, I was NOT playing the game.
- Lacking NPCs. The world is empty of any soul and even the crafting NPC feel soulless. It'd be nice to find some in the wild and bring them back to your base or something. Like, rescue events or something like this.

For the price, this is a good game for anyone that likes RPG fantasy and survival crafting. I know I have a lot more to learn, but I'm not trying to burn myself out on this one. Seems like a pretty good long-haul game so far. I look forward to more content, but as always... steam early access is all up to chance. So... buyer beware lol

It is fun, but it is not AMAZING. I don't mean it isn't good, I kinda just wish there was more? If this had a AAA budget, it would be amazing (probably) but they have done well with what they have. I am fairly early in the game currently, but I have had enough fun to justify the purchase at least. 14 hours at the time of writing, and I am only level 5... Leveling seems to be heavily reliant on fighting, but I'm having a hard time getting very far without getting distracted... though that is dying off and I think I need to focus on leveling (maybe)

i seem to be in a bit of a limbo at 5, I haven't been getting anything exciting to craft or build and just getting some relatively banal offerings. A new block style to build a base, farming food that currently doesn't seem super useful... as I can't seem to cook anything exciting. I can now make different armor sets, for the various damage-dealing offerings. Basically, cloth(caster), leather for movement, leather balanced(ranged/movement), leather for ranged only, and melee heavy armor. 

This is why I say I am slightly disappointed, or rather that I am hoping for more. I have worked fairly hard to get to this point, building a house and setting myself up with materials... but I am not getting new things to work towards. My first 3 big breakthroughs (avoiding spoilers as much as I can) were all just access to crafting different armor classes mostly, I could make a few weapons but drops have been much better than crafted stuff. So I am currently just hoping to get more interesting building and crafting soon. This means in my 14 hours, all I have done is unlock the ability to gear towards a particular style of combat. I can either be melee, ranged, or caster... and now my gear will help with my choice, but naturally... I am only one of those things, so the other options are all wasted and of no interest to me.

The combat is not complex, and a little repetitive if I am honest, but it does feel fairly rewarding with the dropped gear and unique crafting materials for some of the enemies. I rather enjoy a slow leveling process, so I am excited to see that I am only level 5... but, I do wish exp came from more sources. Feels like I could play for 3 hours gathering materials and basically get no experience at all. I don't know if I am missing something, but operating only on the things I've learned I am lacking variety on my building/crafting currently. Hopefully it opens up soon, or I learn that I am doing something wrong lol",1708701413,1708701413,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I heard the ""crafting is as good as 7 days"" which immediately made me pick this up,

The crafting is nice and easy... Not as good though, there's far more options and variety in 7days which puts it on a completely different level, I am sure Enshrodued can get there but atm it's far more plain, compared to a game i think this game took a lot of inspiration from... Valheim, the crafting is god tier vs that game.

Overall the crafting is solid but lacks what the absolute top crafting games do.

The performance issues and difficulty is another thing though.

I am genuinely suprised that this game can run how bad it does, 144fps but actually more like 60fps, compeletly fake frames. 4090 and 7800x3d, fully maxed at 4k with 100% scaling, i get sub 60fps, the options are also buggy so that sometimes the options don't stick, you can change to 1440p and get less fps than 4k, because the settings aren't actually changing what they should...

The animations in game are not syncing to the same fps which makes it feel horrible, most people are locking frame rates at 60fps to try and bring some stability in this issue, i however still get moments where at locked 60fps, and fps is literally stuck to 60... my game stutters/animations look like 20fps.

This is also using G sync... so none of that BS.

Difficulty wise, no slider, boring, same few mobs and all the environment looks the same after  a while. The buildings i enter to find a chest, are all the same... you find the same 3 or 4 items, constantly finding weapons of better quality... that do the exact same damage, there's no variety, it's a chore.

Our first boss, Fell.... something.... died in 10 seconds at lvl 2 or 3. Very simple and a complete let down. I hope this game improves a lot over the next few updates, Valheim started great but lost my interest with it's terrible update schedule, as an early access there is nothing wrong with going from medicore -> great though.

The building in this game is awesome, one of the best base building in the genre.
Combat is so-so, with various enemies & bosses.
Crafting is pretty deep.
Main Quests progression are lock on the world/server.
Multiplayer across region is really bad.

----------

It is missing a lot of basic QoL, like auto loot, bulk crafting, more material conversion, gear comparison, etc.
And it start really slow at the beginning, until you unlock all the npc, that's where the game starting to get interesting.
The progression can be a bit weird sometimes, like you unlock the recipe first before finding/unlocking the material first.
Or you get the material first, but unable to use it for later on.

The grind to craft item needed is fairly easy and the combat can be easy depending on your build.
There are a lot of quests to do, but most of them are side quests. So if you are a rusher, perhaps you can finish the game a lot faster, like half the play time.",1708691329,1708691329,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I currently have 2 playthrougs going on, one with 3 other firends and one solo. For me personally I definitely think the co-op is more fun than playing solo, but even if you can't get a group of firends together to play, you will most likely still have a good time with this game.
Overall I think the combat is good and entertaining, but one thing I dislike about it, is when you are fighting boss fights, you a lot of the time either feel overpowered or severely underpowered, it's rare that I have felt like I was on the same power level as the boss I'm fighting, but that might just be me. Most of the other negative things I can say about the game, involve small bugs and glitches, which does make you have to restart the game every now and then, but I think it's to be expected of a early access game, so it dosen't bother me too much.
Lastly there are 2 thing I would love to see get added to the game. First and foremost, I would love to see a creative mode, where you can just go crazy with the building mechanics without having to farm resources, craft materials etc. The other thing is it would be nice if there could be some way that you could continue playing on a friends world without needing them to be online. As I menionend earlier I currently have a playthrough with 3 other people, and I'm the one hosting the server, which makes it so the others can only play on our world when I'm there to hold the server open, but at the end of the day It's not a huge dealbreaker for me.

+ can have multiple bases.(Numbers tied to Flame upgrades)

+- Only had one crash so far, and in an Early Access that's great!

- Performance is not the best it can be.(Please add FSR 3)
- Minor bugs that probably will be fixed before 1.0.

Feedback: Please add FSR 3 it's awesome for performance!

So i have over 100 hours into Enshrouded, and i must say its one of the better survival games ive played, and will continue to play for many more hours. Building is excelent, when you die you dont lose absolutely everything (needs a hard mode) keep in mind the game is barely a month old so things will change. Ive played full price AAAA games that dont run as smooth.

You are 100% able to do everything up to level cap (25 at the moment) if thats your thing, but servers hold up to 16.

Loot, fight, build. Every new material beholds new possibilities, which keeps the game interesting for a long time. Your main objective is to upgrade your 'flame' so you can advance further into the game. Unfortunately I haven't been captivated by the story and after a few lore notes, I quickly started to skip reading them. I mostly enjoy building my base, hoarding materials, fighting enemies, and last but not least: gliding! 
[h3] Crashes [/h3]
At this moment I experience lots of mini-dump crashes, especially around and gliding off a waypoint spire, which is quite frustrating now and then. Although none of the possible solution I found, actually worked but I have hope this will be patched in the near future. 
[h3] Enshroudheim [/h3]
Between Valheim en Enshrouded, I'd say they're both winners. Both provide tons of fun, in slightly different ways. The excitement of traversing by boat in Valheim is comparable to the gliding fun in Enshrouded.

The combat is boring, like reeealy boring. Melee only has one type of attack at the beginning, and you just run up and m1 stun things to death. Parrying hardly works, dodging while locked on sucks because it makes you strafe around an enemy instead of dodging in the direction you were moving in, often leading to you getting hit anyways. Enemy placement is awful and either feels extremely predictable or unfair. An example of unfair placement would be walking into the middle of a room and 20 bugs spawning around you with no warning leading you to get stunned to death.

Ranged is also boring, most enemies you can just backpedal while shooting and win, this also applies to magic wands.
Staffs are garbage, while they have more range, there is no tracking like there is for wands, and even worse, the spells are boring reskins of the others, aside from shroud comet, but that spell has literally only worked once for me, no matter how I aim it will only hit directly in front of me and doesnt hit from the high ground. A wizard using resources to cast spells (because you have to craft them) should feel powerful at the very least aesthetically but most are just a glowing projectile.

Player crafted weapons are garbage that cannot be upgraded, the best way to get gear is to clear one of the late game towers, then log out and log back in to do the same puzzle to get to the chest and repeat.

Most of the skill tree consists of percent increases in damage, rather than focusing on creating new ways to approach the game, while there are a few that give new abilities, the are very few and far between.

With the combat being as it is, of course bosses do not feel good, they are just big health pools that do a lot of damage. The few bosses that have mechanics are not well thought out. For instance, the wyvern has an attack that summons mobs, and you are supposed to shoot at its mouth when it does this to stun it and do big damage, but that only works with a bow, so if you were doing a magic build and did not have a bow (because why would you) this fight is just a slog.

The shroud mechanic initially seemed interesting but eventually just became an annoyance. The timer is easily reset through various air pockets so the shroud only serves to gate progression (and make seeing anything a hassle) since you need to upgrade your flame to enable you to venture into deadly shroud. If the shroud could be permanently cleared by felling elixir wells, it would be a much cooler mechanic, but the elixir wells respawn.
The shroud is also a big annoyance in finding somewhere to live, as many of the cool areas to build have some small pocket of shroud that cannot be cleared and is an eyesore. In addition to that, there are very few flat pieces of land that do not already have some house on it, meaning you have to go through the hassle of breaking buildings down or flattening land yourself.

The NPC's are lifeless and only serve as crafting tables and quest-givers. They should walk around and interact with stuff. Not even the player can sit in the chairs they make.

Progression is gated behind quests, and the NPC's will tell you where to go and when, which makes exploration a lot less appealing, since the most you'll get out of it is some shit loot since you will most likely be exploring a low level area. The random nature of loot really takes away from games like this. Elden Ring's unique weapons with interesting skills attached to them made it appealing to go out of your way to explore but most chests are filled with garbage here.
Progression being tied to quests means that I cannot even just enjoy this game for its building, as I must go use the bad combat mechanic to interact with boring enemies just to unlock more fences.

Farming requires a lot of water, which needs to be extracted from wells, but wells only have a limited amount of water per teleport, so before unlocking the well, you need to keep teleporting back and forth between somewhere and a point near a well to get like 5 water. After unlocking the well, it is still limited for some god-awful reason, so you have to place it down, get water, pick it up, and place it back down to get a reasonable amount of water.
You can't hold down the interact button to place plants, so you have to slowly walk while spamming the button to plant en-mass. Once grown, the is no scythe, so you must interact with every plant you made, and there is a cooldown on doing so.

The crafting stations that have their own inventory cannot draw from other inventories, so you must use the terrible splitting mechanic which only splits in halves, with no other option, to distribute among stations.
In the other crafting stations, there is no multi craft option, so you must press the button 400 times to convert your 400 bug parts into bug dust.

While gliding, you cannot angle yourself upwards, meaning not only that you cannot build momentum up and get altitude, but you cannot even slow yourself down to take in nice views. In addition to that, your camera is locked so that you cannot look behind you or even too far to the sides, its ridiculous.

Performance is also a big issue. I have a 4060, 32GB Ram, and a 5800X, but struggle to maintain a consistent 60fps 1080p on 'quality' settings, and even on a lowered setting where I can maintain 60fps, it still feels choppy at times even though the fps counter still reports 60. Worst of all, every few minutes, especially during combat, I will encounter a 1-4 second freeze, but the game continues to run and hold whatever input I was holding. I have died far too many times walking off of a cliff edge or getting hit during these freezes.

This game needs a lot of work done in order to properly compete in the over-saturated market of survival craft games, and it is not worth your time at the moment, especially singleplayer.",1708676614,1708676614,False,5,1,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,True

My original review was negative, and while those issues still remain and I still hope that the game improves in important ways, the overall package that Enshrouded offers is...quite good, even in Early Access.

The core elements all good: combat is nice and responsive, there are a decent amount of weapons and gear, the survival elements are minimal but still add to the game while not being overbearing, and the world is already very large and interesting to explore even though it's a something like only 25% of the final game's planned size.

And just as importantly as all of that, the building mechanics are very robust, varied, intuitive, and very enjoyable. 

The issues are a bit frustrating, such as a major boss that has exceptionally poor signposting for its ""boss gimmick"" as well as just not at all being enjoyable to fight, and there are a number of areas where the virtually insta-kill lava offers nothing but a giant headache that only frustrates navigation rather than adding any kind of tension or interest, but these are not deal breakers compared to the whole package. They really need to be improved because I can see a lot of people bouncing or almost bouncing like I did, but this shouldn't stop anyone who thinks the game looks good from supporting and enjoying it.

And of course there are many areas that could use improvement like making the NPCs more interesting and perhaps giving them some kind of routines at your base so they aren't just basically animated mannequins, and hopefully in time the team will be able to deliver on the game's full potential.

Even though it just released in Early Access it's already very good, so I look forward to what the full game offers.",1708308703,1708669796,True,0,0,0.459610044956207275,0,True,False,True

Even on ""quality"" this game consistently runs my CPU at close to 90C, being liquid cooled there's not another game out right now that comes within 10 degrees of that. Theres no lag, but also no reason it should run this hot.

The game is stupidly hard. You should consider that when deciding to play alone. I don't mind difficult strategic combat that you pay the price for mistakes you made. This is being swarmed from enemies out of nowhere or almost instadeath from being in an overly enshrouded area. Cheap deaths seem to be good enough for players these days to warrant a ""difficult"" game. Not enjoyable for me. 

On that note there's no real price to pay for dying, feels so inconsequential in this game because you keep most of your gear. Even things like food poisoning only last a few seconds. On a game where you die so frequently it seems like it would be welcome, but for me it just cheapened the experience.

And lastly building is also superficial. The building system itself is one of the plus sides. The things you can create are amazing, a ton of freedom. But it just feels unnecessary in this game. Other games the need for shelter becomes immediately relevant. The need to build shelter and begin to better yourself makes sense, feels like a natural part of the game. Here it honestly just feels like they put it in just to have it be a survival crafting game. Even the NPC's that you can populate your creations with feel dull and lifeless. They're essentially talking workbenches.

That's not to say this game is terrible. It has great graphics and atmosphere. The building system allows for some truly awesome creations. It just feels like it's lacking a soul overall, like eye candy without the depth and charm of other survival crafting games.",1708658173,1708658173,False,2,0,0.507168471813201904,0,True,False,True

World destructibility is pretty good as well. There are some small elements that remind me slightly of TLoZ Breath of the Wild as well. It's a bit buggy, as expected with early access. My only real complaint is that there doesn't appear to be a way to have an always-visible crosshair or aiming indicator unless I'm missing it.

The exploration is excellent and I enjoyed the combat system. Controls are responsive and when you get in trouble, you probably knew the risk you were taking before hand. In other words, I did not experience any 'gotchas'. The home and base building features remind me of Valheim, but much easier to use. Frankly, most things in Enshrouded seem easier than in Valheim, in my opinion. 

I played the solo game to level 25, the beta level cap, and will probably continue exploring the map while waiting for the next installment. I just started a new game with some friends on a private server. We use Discord, because the game does not have any means of player communication in game, like chat boxes. That is not a problem to me. It is beta and most people are going to want to use a chat service when playing with others.

A game's combat system often times makes or breaks a game, no matter how pretty it may be. Enshrouded's combat system is still in beta, but it feels right. I started off with a sword and shield and was very pleased to see that blocks, parries, and dodge rolls worked so well that I could depend on them. Using a wand was very fun, too. My current favorite weapon is the bow. It reminds me a little bit of playing Skyrim and snipping mobs with a bow. The staff is one weapon I have not played with enough to say how I feel about it.

I have to keep reminding myself that this game is still in beta. It is not a cheap knock-off of another game. It is polished and fun. I recommend it to players who enjoy this type game.

- The Cactus still does not harm the player, but every other plant does. (This is basic Minecraft level polish required.)
- Some Equipment items do not apply their stats. (+1 all attributes, nope!)
- Blink is a reskinned dodge roll. (can't use it in the air and it collides like a full sized player)
- 2 handed weapons not only have no reach bonus, but are penalized by having no aim assist.
- blink attack is more effective than magic

To be clear: in my first couple of hours, I was having fun. I enjoyed exploring the landscape, finding bits of lore hidden away, being an absolute loot gremlin in the process. I think that the base building mechanics and Terrain editing has a lot to offer those who like building a cool base.

That said, the combat is incredibly shallow. At times it's trying to be a souls-lite, but the enemies are not intelligent enough, responsive enough, or frankly interesting enough to put up a real fight. Dodge-rolling is present, but simply jumping is an easier and more stamina effective method of avoiding incoming damage in most cases. Enemies, for the most part, don't become more technically challenging as you progress; rather, it's a game of ""number go up"" where the same enemies make the same attacks, but have more HP and do more damage. 

The ""craftspeople"" you rescue to unlock further building capability feel odd. They provide commentary and some quests, but for the most part just stand there and act as a living workbench. Would be way more interesting if they had passive jobs while at your base.

Overall, from what I could tell from watching higher-level gameplay from youtubers, it doesn't seem that gameplay expands or changes dramatically after you climb the first tower. Numbers go up, you get more crafting stations, but otherwise it's all the same. 

Finally, the performance. I don't have a super high-spec computer, but this game is so horribly optimized that I get more frames and graphical fidelity playing Cyberpunk than I do from this game. Add to that, while playing it would take up several gigabytes of space on my SSD.

I could go on and talk about a bunch of more minor issues, such as the lack of character customization options, or how wonky the gliding mechanics are, I think the above critiques are enough on their own for me to decide that I'm likely not playing this again. 

And, yes. It's early access. I am well aware that this game could be patched into a better game. But a game should have it's core fundamentals figured out well before it leaves alpha. Valheim launched with several biomes unfinished and it's still not ""done"", but the gameplay loop was so solid and well designed that few of those core mechanics have been tweaked since, and it's regarded as a well-made modern survival crafter to this day.

After 100 hours I can say that I really enjoy this game. If you are someone who enjoys rushing to the max level and getting the best loot available as early as possible you probably wont enjoy Enshrouded. There is much work to do from the dev team but in it's current state I have gotten more enjoyable play time than most AAA game releases.

If you take your time and explore and try to get those achievements unlocked than you will find lots of fun in this game. Even with the constructive criticism from many reviews it is hard to believe a review with 20 hours of game play as they haven't even had time to explore the whole map. There are many secrets if you read the lore and follow the story but it seems most reviews that are negative or positive with negative constructive criticism are by those people.

If you enjoy building than you need not second guess Enshrouded. By far the best building in any Survival type game. The New world comments are funny to me as this game is nothing like New world which was made by a AAA team. I would know as I put over 300 hours in New World. The comparison is the # of mob types. Which a single player or co-op adventure game isn't going to have a great # of enemy types; this is however expected in a MMO. Each type is based on the biome, each having its own unique mob types with a sprinkle of the humanoid mob types from the other biomes. No different than Valhiem and other survival games.

Those complaining about the collision with rolling when swarmed by mobs just don't have the IQ skill to jump over the mobs. Not to mention blink is by far the best skill in the game. If your looking for a game you can spend a few hours in on the weekends or after work than this game is for you. Not only can you enjoy time solo but jump in with your friends at any point while still using your character.

People complaining about no mod support already are so funny, the game isn't even finished that's why the level cap is 25 and the ""END GAME"" is collecting resources. We are on 1/3 of the entire map for early access. Why would they add mod support for an unfinished game? Or how about not worth $30 but these people spend 20 to 30 hours in the game. You just paid a $1-$2 an hour to play a game. Name one thing you can go out and do for fun that cost you $1-$2 an hour. You can't!

There are bugs and issues which is somewhat expected at early access but I have not experienced anything game breaking up to this point. The devs are very active on their discord and the community is very helpful as well. Do I think Enshrouded is the best game? No, I do not, but it isn't a complete game yet and once more content is added it can be in my top 10 memorable games.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Pros:
- THE best building I've experienced in all of survival games, it is fun, intuitive and honestly somehow both complex and simple, what i mean by this is for a player that doesn't usually like building it will be as fun as for that player that builds a whole castle before killing the first mob
-pretty solid combat and animations, it just feels good like a somewhat simplified from software combat style
-pretty big talent tree to explore and make build
-nice weapons and cosmetics
-extremely interesting world and mobs, 
-great bosses
-fun movement with the gliders and all

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Cons:
-even doe the talent tree is pretty big and i have yet a lot to explore i feel most of it is rather weak, some enemies in the game will just make the melee and ranged classes almost impossible to play, and even doe the game offer a pretty generous reset system for build the only build i felt strong with and not fighting for my life constantly was the mage build focusing on wands, i absolutely loved it doe and do take this point with a grain of salt seeing that most of it is subjective, i do believe maybe higher skilled players would make melee more viable for sure
-even doe i loved the gliders most of the time if feels like the distance between an interest point and the main fast travel towers is too far and somewhat frustrating that being said i believe the solution would be more movement options besides the glider, maybe some skates or something like that
-even doe there are parts of the tree that are rogue inspired we do not get the option to wield daggers which I found rather disappointing as i would've love a build where I could explore the sneak attack a bit more and to do that without daggers or dual wielding feels odd

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

All of that being said i still do have a lot to explore regarding the late game and am excited to do so, cant wait for future updates and to see more content added in what I believe to possibly be the best survival to play with friends of 2024 even in the early access state

What I liked:
- Building. It was pretty user friendly,  which is big for me because as much as I love doing it in these games, I'm not very good at it. Also, the game doesn't make you gather crazy amount of materials to build. You still have to chop and mine, but I don't feel like it makes you do it to much.

- Exploring. The game is so big already and while there are quest markers telling me what's next, I've had a lot of fun just running and gliding in another direction. This was usually rewarded with finding a village or cave or mine that had some lore to read. No game changing finds, but it felt rewarding to find something new off the beaten path.

- NPCs / Quests. Not something I usually see in this type of game, but I thought it added a fun element to the usual recipe.

- Performance. I played on Steam Deck and it ran great. Ate some battery, but if I tweaked the settings a bit I was getting about two hours with everything still looking and running fine.

- The Shroud. It adds a planning element to exploration. Going in to mine, for a quest, or just exploring new areas means different amounts of time and preparation. There was always a way out, as long as I kept my eye on the time and planned accordingly... which I didn't always do!

Needs Improvement:
- Combat. It's not bad, just a little bland. This isn't always a big deal for me in survival games, but the game forces a lot of combat and it gets old to me after a bit. When I jump back in after an update or two, I'll try a different style, I leaned hard in to mage this time.

- Crafting vs Drops. You can either craft weapons and armor or use whqt you find/loot throughout the world. I felt the found items were usually better which diminished the need to craft new weapons, something I like doing in these games.

- Biome diversity. There are different biomes in the game, but I didn't feel a major difference between them as I went from one to the other.  Villages, trees, and the general aesthetic still felt the same.

game play is quite fun there is loads to do and enough to keep you entertained so you cant really lose interest quickly. The boss fights are some what interesting, and as others have mentioned the reach and fight patterns are quite easy to memorise and counter just the only thing that lets you down early on in the game is the stamina and how quickly it depletes which is kind of a pain or maybe its just me who knows.

I also didn't think I would enjoy it to the extent I do as it didn't really seem like my type of game but here we are 35 hours in and still constantly playing it every day. Just looking forward to what might be introduced in the future.

Others have said melee builds feel weak, which I agree with, so I'm looking forward to seeing balance changes. I am running a tank build apparently made of newspaper and the person I play with most is an ice/acid mage who levels entire playing fields in a few moves. 

The main complaint I have is after 85+ hours I desperately wanted to keep playing but there is nothing to do aside from farming bosses and gold chests on a rotation and building things arbitrarily. I've played this game entirely in multiplayer with one other and it was very sad when we both realized that we have nothing else to do. I see that the base game map area is huge, so I'm looking forward to seeing that filled out over time.

I'm sure I'll give PW a try eventually, but right now I am loving Enshrouded.  I love the survival crafting games Valheim, 7days to die, Ark, Conan Exiles, and Icarus.  Enshrouded has now been added to that list. The building part of this game is amazing. The only downfall is it missing round/corner shapes, but I understand it's EA so I'm not too concerned. 

The exploration part is very engaging as well. From what I understand, only 1/3 of the world is currently available to us, and that turns out to be quite a lot.  It's a big world to explore and running across structures or camps not on the map is enjoyable. 

Crafting is well thought out and fairly deep. It's definitely one of those where everything is going to be used.  You don't starve or dehydrate, but food and drink are used for powerful buffs.

Character creation is complex and fun, although you end up looking like a hobbit no matter what you choose. :)

Combat is fast and fun, although the enemy ai needs a little tlc, and dying comes often. I'm glad there's no death counter as I'm sure mine is over a 100 easily, mostly from gliding into the red lava of death or having a mob run up from behind me and one shot me. :p

All in all, I give it a solid thumbs up considering it's only been released and has the potential to become a major player in survival crafting games.

This is not a ""definitive"" Negative review, however, as these things might get patched. On to the review though:

While, yes, the building is phenomenal and a definite step up with the creative freedom it brings it is the danger enemies pose which sours the entire package. Whether gathering materials, food or going for quests, you are bound to fight. The trouble here, though, isn't the ineffectiveness of the playstyles (Magic, Melee, Ranged) but rather the enemies themselves. I play solo, so the following issues aren't derived from a poor connection or such issues:

- Wildly inaccurate tells for hits: Enemies' attacks can be learned and dodged, but there are times where their reach is clearly excessive or the hit-detection is not comparable to the visible model. A good example are boars, who have on one hand a predictible charge and a short-range double-swipe with their tusks...which does not deal damage after a wind-up but immediately on Frame 1 of the animation. Going into melee here guarantees almost a hit unless you count the time between their actions as you cannot visibly gauge when the first of the two hits strikes, resulting in a very cheap hit.

Another example is, in general, the humanoid enemies and how the parry-window isn't clearly defined. There are bear-like humanoids who can only be parried at the start of their attack's wind-up, while the actual attack itself is already in an unparriable state. Shroud enemies and Scavengers' parries tend also to be misaligned from their models, but here I have trouble getting consistent results as well.

- Being hit results in a light stun: One of the most frustrating things is that being hit does not mean ""being hit once"" but ""subjected to the rest of the attack sequence of the enemy"". The on-hit ston of any attack prevents rolling and blocking/parrying, ensuring one mistake is paid dearly for. Some enemies have such multi-combo attacks that you can lose over half your available health after being hit once...which is not ideal.

- The damage is at times excessive: Tying into the above, the damage dealt from those multi-attacks is brutal. In this game, healing is not as feasible outside of spells and potions, both of which require resource-gathering to provide sufficient numbers. The amount of healing provided is great, yet with being hit once consuming already the first type of potion's entire healing capability you go through these quite fast. Farming in this game takes time and the quantity of resources needed for the average person to deal with the damage will be considerate...and that keeps one stuck in the gathering stage rather than exploring the dangerous places for loot and progression.

- Difficulty ramping, armor and content gating: Workstations are unlocked by exploring and finding key components to make them. These are often in the next highest level region than the previous, as expected. The same goes for the resources...and that is where most of the previous issues combine into a major problem: The armour you can craft is limited by the stations you have and the areas where you find the next components has enemies appropriate for that station's provided benefits. Or, in other words, you have to get the means to make better armor in regions where you already need them to survive easier. In solo I am almost required to cheese enemies to not get hit as I intended to play a ranger, but this just feels cheap and not rewarding. Going into melee, however, results in dealing with the jank I spoke of before and that cost me plenty of deaths. Since a lot of progress is done in ruins and places with little elevation I regretted my choice to play a ranger rather quickly as their armor is, as expected, in an even worse position than the tank's own.


I will admit here that I am playing solo, that this is meant to be played with several people and such, yet I don't have the time to go online that often (or more specifically: In a consistent pattern). That means some of my criticisms are part of the way I play, but this doesn't cause them to no longer be an issue: Whomever is going to play a Fighter, on- or offline, will deal with the janky melee combat anyways. The places you have to go to remain as dangerous and while many hands gather more you are bound to consume a lot more too.

As others have said, the building and the rest of the game, especially the scope, are still impressive and will keep me personally interested for a good while. There is 100% a great time here, just at this time there are bugs and a lot of jank you need to accept for the time being. IF you read this far and are weighing your options, let me say this: I reckon these bugs and issues will get addressed in the future, so this negative review is just as temporary (hopefully). I will update this review once these problems have been dealt with, though even now one thing I need to say clearly:

I was really looking forward to this one, I managed to get into the open test last year but the bug for 10series cards prevented me from discovering the warning signs that would have curbed my enthusiasm. I really like what they've achieved with base building, it's fantastic and you can see some excellent builds on youtube. But that's pretty much where the fun ends for me.

 I've already gone more in depth about the problems in my YT video, so i'll keep this one short and just speak to the fact I thought this was meant to be a co-op RPG with some light survival elements, but in the end it feels more like a light rpg with slightly more than light survival elements, but mostly just spend your time grinding. My YT video copped a lot of flak comments from the fanbois, stating I am the only one who thinks this way, but after seeing the negative reviews it looks like there are many more with the same problems. And this is even more reflected in the achievements display. 

After my first YT video I noticed that only 47% of people had made it to level 5. So I did a stream of my gameplay from the start through to level 5 and it took me like 2-3 hrs. Now they announce 2 million copies sold, but the amount of people reaching level 5 is only up to 57%, and with only 95% having made it to level 2 (AKA walking outside of the starting cave), that's a very large amount of people that have switched off the game between the 7 minute and 3 hr mark.  

Some people are enjoying the tedium enforced in the grind, but I feel that the game has failed to meet expectations based on what I saw from the marketing of it. It's still EA, and whilst the devs say they are happy to take feedback to shape the game, a look at the feedback section really doesn't seem to have much that addresses the core elements of the gameplay. But I will come back and see what happens when they launch 1.0, see what gets added and if it's enough to rate, but for now I don't recommend the game to people unless you really want something to waste time in or a cathartic house builder (in which case, beg them to include a creative mode)",1708584002,1708584002,False,0,0,0.41269838809967041,0,True,False,True

The world doesn't push you back at all making all upgrades non mandatory. Why search for new gear if it is this easy already? O new skill points why even use them I already kill everything with ease.

And you can teleport basically everywhere you want. Making for even less problems. I don't mind you keep your gear when you die but realistically now you only die when you fall into something. And then just like valheim you STILL need to go back to your body. The character movement is very janky. The jump animation is bad.

And I made a girl who doesn't look like a girl.

Enemy attacks have terrible design. Just stand back for a few animations and attack.

If they somehow fix balance problems and make the world push back 10x harder

Just put more re spawn points close to events just like the puzzle temples and make bosses and fights 10x harder but really easy to try again.

The survival genera has so many titles these days, some well done, some iconic, some so badly done you want to smash them with the DM hammer.

Enshrouded is an interesting but in some ways underwhelming addition to this list.

One thing that does stand out to me as being awesome is the building mechanics, they work really well, well thought out and good options to build large areas en-mass or fine-tune one block at a time.

The shroud side of thing is a nice touch, and the background story is great imo.

Unfortunately much of the game feels a little, erm, childish?

Graphics are underwhelming.
Mechanics feel simplified.
The rescued npcs are a bit empty.
The magic system is generic for the most part although a welcome addition often not included in the genera.

A lot of the mechanics feel slimmed down, maybe more of a survival lite experience in some ways.
This does lead to some interesting advantages, such as auto repair of all damaged gear when you interact with you basic workbench.

The combat is functional, but very simple - you lock onto the target and tap square to attack, circle to occasionally dodge and then repeat. There is not much variety or strategy involved, and it can get boring after a while.  

Crafting was frustrating. It took me way too long to figure out how to place the flame altar.  It should just go to the placement screen once you have crafted it, but if your main inventory is full you have to move things around then select the altar and then you can place it. It's a tedious and unintuitive process that could be improved.

The game looks great, but it's not very well optimized. I experienced some frame drops and stuttering, even though I have a 7900XTX.

The controls were smooth and responsive.  I like that you can select PlayStation controller inputs - more games should have this as an option.

I generally know when a game is for me within the first hour of playing and I just didn't get any of those vibes.  The best alternative I have played that is similar to this (although in quite a different setting) is No Man's Sky where I have +190 hrs.

Oh well, as already mentioned further down, the baloon bursts after some time, since nothing is saved to the ""handcrafted"" world you play in, which is a bit of a shame. Back to Valheim I guess ...

ORIGINAL :

Really well done game compared to others (i.e. Palworld) for its current ""early access"" status.
There is plenty of content and already working mechanics within the game to rightfully claim that.

The significant positives :

- The world is well designed and always makes you lurk around the next corner to find another interesting spot on the map.

- The companions / npc keep you rolling as well with each of their technologies to unlock and the quest-system that comes with each of them.

- The skill tree adds some real roleplaying section to the game.
You are actually developing your character a little.

The significant negatives :

On the other hand the most positive fact of an large, far visible, handcrafted world comes with the issue that is beeing reset each time you start into the game. Extinguishing the feeling of progression within the world. NPC will respawn, Chests are refilled, Outposts restored, Deposits are filled up again either, the Shroud you are supposed to drive back of course respawns as well.

The quest system on the other hand does have the issue, that it doesnt really apply to multiple players on each session. Meaning that it aint shared between the party, ending up in a session restart, so the 2nd player can complete the quest with a newly respawned chest on his own.

The skydiving and controls are sometimes not 100 % well thought out yet. The automatic roll after each gliding may sometimes push you across a certain edge which may end up in immediate death sentence, where precision in jumping would be needed (And the double jump aint really improving that issue either at a certain point.)

Overall conclusion :

Until now this is really encouraging to head on further into the world despite the negatives.
But it might be, that once in a while I will get back to Valheim instead, since the world progression and most important saved progress is necessary for me to really feel me involved into the world, even if it comes with way shorter viewing distance, it feels more rounded up and thought out.

P.S. : And please add an weather effects system to the game at some point. A ton of atmosphere is missed out by that. Same goes for the missing water / oceans / fishing / shipyards etc.",1706488289,1708563275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It still needs a few QoL improvements like being able to choose how much to split stacks of object into or naming/labelling chests but it is in a good state and I'm eager to see how the game will keep on evolving in the future.

TLDR: The game has really good ideas and execution in certain areas but feels slightly unbalanced in others and will need to iron these kinks out but it currently promises a bright future.

The gameplay is quite smooth. You get some nice traversal options early in the game so getting around the map doesn't feel like a slog. 
The building system feels weird at first needing you to craft blocks of wood/stone/etc to use for the blueprint but you soon discover that this offers you a lot of freedom to build with just the blocks, using blueprints here and there to have a base and then adding and removing blocks to your liking to create more unique shapes. This in fact lets you be really creative with how you would want to build your base, structures, art projects.
The combat is pretty dynamic but feels unbalanced. Ranged combat is heavily favoured with archery being the safest and best at dealing damage overall. Magic follows suit with wands at close-medium distance that deal good damage for no resources but keep you close to the danger of being one or two hit if your armour isn't up to par. You then have staffs that use mana to cast actual spells but the mana cost is huge with the mana regen being abysmal. On top of needing to charge up your spell before being able to cast them, this makes staff very clunky to use even though those spells are really strong. And then there's melee that feels like it doesn't deal any damage sometimes, other times you're in a shield stalemate with another enemy and no one is taking damage.
As for exploration, there is plenty of contents for you to experience and areas for you to explore with quite a bunch hand crafted puzzles and exploration. You do feel a style throughout those so it can be a bit same-ish at times but there are plenty of hidden treasures and lore tidbits and the likes to keep you engaged and entertained.

1203620,158931748,76561198016871624,0,29,1193,1049,1193,1708557865,"I tried to love it. I really did. I put in nearly 20 hours and decided to uninstall and I likely won't be picking it up again.

To be fair, the game is absolutely beautiful and the base building is great. The rest of the game is not awesome. It is plagued left and right with bad design choices, and awful balancing. The combat stands out as the worst part of the game. Initially I was playing a 2H build and then accidentally salvaged the my LEGENDARY weapon because there's no confirmation for that and it's an instant thing. After that I tried a wizard build and discovered this build is not balanced enough for solo play at all. First off, spells need ammo, second, the ratio of damage done to mana used is terrible. I get 4 shots in before I run out of mana and even buffed my mana regenerates at a snails pace. There are wands to use which do not require ammo and gain you back mana per hit but at very small amounts. That and the game seems almost specifically designed to avoid targeting enemies closest to you in both manual targeting and auto. Another issue with the staff is the timing for actually getting a hit in is very difficult. Spells require charging and then there's a wind-up before the spell is actually cast. So when you're being bared down on by enemies your window for getting a hit in is very hard to get as enemies are often quick or in groups of 5-6 at a time. Enemy ranged attacks also have barely any wind-up themselves for both bows, crossbows, and thrown items. Also, get used to enemies taking up to 3/4 of your health per hit as if you will need extra mana and regen from wizard amor which gives almost zero armor rating. So you will die alot. Which brings us to more bad design choices:

First off, you are not at full health after respawning. You health isn't cut down like in Demons Souls or Dark Souls 2, you're just not at full health for whatever reason.  Next up is respawn points. You DO have the advantage of being allowed to drop down your own but only so many of them and the natural respawn points are few and far between. You can fast-travel but only to a specific and sparse-few natural respawn points. So you will be walking back A LOT. Which brings me to the game's namesake: The Enshrouded. 

The Enshrouded are mushroom-cloud and enemy infested areas throughout the game which are scary, and beautiful to behold. They are, however, a massive pain the ass to explore and fight it as you are constantly surrounded by a cloud that's not easy to see through. Upon entering one of these areas you are given a timer which gets greater the more you upgrade your Flame Altar(base building area) but the thing about this is once the timer runs out the enshrouded kills you instantly. I've upgraded my flame altar twice and only get a 5 minute timer. There are also areas, which are not always the easiest to spot ahead of time, that drastically drain this timer when you're in them. There are ways to extend the timer through natural ""lanterns"" that you pick up but they're actually quite rare to find, and potions which are not terribly easy to craft and only offer an extra 1 minute extra time per use. So once you are in one of these areas you had better hope you are lucky enough to find a way out, otherwise you're screwed. This game also, for whatever reason this has become an annoying trend in the past few years, has a major problem treating slopes like they're all slathered in lube. You might be able to traverse a decent incline but at a certain point your character will decided to uncontrollably saunter back down.

All-in-all, there's some cool ideas here and it is in Early Access but when did Early Access become an enabling environment for people to sling whatever poorly-playtested garbage at people and call it a playable experience? This game shouldn't have been released with these issues and now I've run into the inherent problem with Early Access: Hoping the developers can actually identify the problems with their game and fix them or I'm stuck having spent money on a goose egg.

Who know though, right? There's 30,000 positive reviews for this game as I write this and less-than 5,000 negative ones. So you make the decision. I will say this though: Every negative review is complaining about the same problems over and over again.

TLDR You should be playing Valheim.

The good : nice graphics and a pretty solid voxel building system.  There is a grappling hook and a glider to explore around oh and cheap teleports to explore and have fun.
The bad : pretty basic enemy AI, easy bosses, zero pressure, no raids at your homebase (so no need to defend rendering the building system optional), dying hardly matters (so it fails as a survival game), exploration is not rewarding and gets boring pretty soon.  The loot system is all over the place, I got myself a couple legendary weapons since day 1 and then useless loot for 30 hours of gameplay or so.
The ugly : character design is very limited... basically you have to play as a hobbit (a big headed hobbit)

Let's leave it at that since it is still Early Access.  I'll be back for the release of 1.0 and reevaluate my opinion.

To the devs : go play Valheim and figure out how to evoke the same dread and awe of exploring the world.  The shroud should feel at least as scary as sailing away on a feeble raft with a sea serpent on your tail.  Improve your building system to make it non optional, but an important part of your defense and survival.  what's the point of growing and roasting corn if a simple nut is better and easier to find???",1708550727,1708550727,False,1,0,0.437766492366790771,0,True,False,True

Comparing the two may shed some light even for those who are not considering this. I will detail Nightingale only enough to highlight Enshrouded for this review. I've done the same for Nightingale already. 

Character creation for Enshrouded is quicker due to limited options. Choose a face and go, pretty much. Nightingale's may be more detailed but the faces are extreme; it's hard to get a look you like. Enshrouded also has a smooth start; you get right to fighting and base building is fast; like Nightingale, you can place blocks or walls, roofs, and floors, but you have way more options and even after placing you can alter a placed object block by block. However, Enshrouded's story is just lost. Mostly is learned through reading books as you go. I'm sorry, but this is just not immersive. 

What Enshrouded does right is crafting and base-building. Yes you can spend time on it, but its quick, fun and lets you get right back to exploring, questing, and fighting. New crafting stations are staggered, coming after you find a new NPC for your base. Nightingales is one crafting station after another (I'm at seven stations in my little stick house and this is my first day playing that game). 

Calling Enshrouded's combat soleslike is an insult to souls fans, but it is fun and engaging. I would say the worst part is that in the end, you will all worship the wand and leave behind your swords and bows. I find this sad. I can explain the 'why' of this, but it doesn't matter. Hopefully they will balance this. Nightingale's combat so far only requires getting the mob to lunge at you and side step, then wack a few times and repeat. Maybe it gets better but Enshrouded's doesn't have the same cumbersome feel as Nightingale's does so far.  

Consider this when choosing between these games, I spent the first few hours fighting and exploring in Enshrouded. I've spend the first few hours gathering resources and unlocking stuff in a stick house for the first few hours in Nightingale. However, Nightingale is stunning in its beauty and Puck pulls me in with constant narration. Enshrouded needs to fix its story telling and Nightingale needs to fix everything but its story telling. That said content is king. Neither game seems as replayable as I would like. So these guys have their work cut out, fix these problems, but keep that content coming, or you will lose that player base.",1708546925,1708547149,True,40,1,0.796664595603942871,2,True,False,True

Being EA, this game is pretty decent. Looks, plays, and sounds good. Definitely lots of clunkiness in some of the game mechanics but it is EA.

At first, I tried to directly compare this game to Valheim, so I felt disappointed in some mechanics. For e.g. The building and crafting. Felt cumbersome. Not that it is difficult, just not as simple. Have to get used to it. Once one gets further the building options are grander but I wish I only had to go to one or two stations with the unlocks available, like Val. I do love that I can dig down. =)
Plus, a lot of the play mechanics share inspiration with Breath of the Wild, whether roaming or fighting. 
The more I play the more I wish some mechanics were more like Val yet there are some mechanics better than Val. 

Oddly, this game gave me an itch to play Val again, so Enshrouded has taken a back seat...

There is a familiar concept here with the 'Shroud'. Not sure if it is recent literature, movies, or perhaps ideas from old cartoons such as Spiral Zone. I definitely got a slight Dragon Quest Builder vibe...restoring the world.",1706907965,1708546773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

WHAT IS ENSHROUDED? 

As a game that brands itself as Zelda Breath of the Wild meets Elden Ring meets Valheim, it has a LOT of work to do to earn that title.  Enshrouded does indeed successfully incorporate elements from all 3 games, but you'll rarely find yourself thinking Enshrouded does any of them better. 

OPEN WORLD EXPLORATION

The open world is vast, mysterious, and beautiful, the way Elden Ring's is.  You're similarly coaxed to explore nooks and crannies you notice from afar.  And while there is, indeed, always something there for you to explore, very often the experience doesn't feel very rewarding.  You'll find yourself dismantling most weapons you find, or deleting most armor you find.  Very few items feel exciting to discover, which eventually starts to harm the exploration experience. 

QUESTING

On that note, Enshrouded definitely suffers from open world quest fatigue.  If you're burned out by games that give you a giant open world map and then hundreds of quest markers for you to go chase down, Enshrouded's open world will start to feel tedious really quickly.  It's very much in the same vein as games like Witcher 3, Horizon, or Hogwarts Legacy.  A seemingly endless number of objects on the map that you have to visit, many of which are essentially the same thing (think: the number of redundant Trials of Merlin in Hogwarts Legacy.)  

That said, Enshrouded's world IS beautiful.  The sheer spectacle of the scenery, combined with the careful crafting of the terrain along with your world progression through the game's ""Shroud"" mechanic, make the general task of traversing the game's 4 major regions a fun, often downright enjoyable, navigation experience. 

CRAFTING

As a ""Survival Crafting"" game, Enshrouded doesn't have many survival components of note.  The basics are there: 

- You can get a ""rested"" buff by sitting or resting at your base.  
- There's food to eat. 
- There are tons of materials to harvest and combine into more useful tools, items and gear.  
- There's a system in place that coaxes you to build a base, populate it with 5 NPCs, build various crafting tables, all of which allow you to unlock better items and upgrades.  

However, there's little need to build your base outside of this linear quest-like progression.  My biggest gripe with crafting and new workbench-type unlocks is that every single one of them have felt anti-climactic to me.  More often than not, I race back to my base after unlocking a new crafting table, like the Chef's oven, excited to check out what cool new foods I can bake, only to be disappointed to learn that that entire machine only offers 1 new food...for a stat that I don't even use, and requires a material I've never encountered yet.  Enshrouded's crafting progression has perpetually left me a tad disappointed.  

Through 80 hours, I can honestly say I've only actually been excited by 1 upgrade I've unlocked: chamomile tea.  This HP and stamina regenerating food was fun to unlock and rewarding to obtain, after experiencing a dozen+ hours of struggling to bandage heal myself in dungeons.  Unlocking this was reminiscent of most Valheim unlocks.  If only every upgrade could feel this tangibly good.  

SURVIVAL 

Regarding survival components, you're very rarely in any danger in Enshrouded.  Your base is fully protected by your flame.  As long as you're there, you're 100% safe.  You can even, however, generally go AFK in the open world.  No enemy is going to spawn or roam and kill you if there isn't one there already.  You don't NEED to eat other than to give yourself very minor food buffs (+3 to a specific stat, or a ~25% boost to your HP.)  You don't NEED to sleep.  The night doesn't present much greater danger than the day time.  Just a few more of the most basic enemies in the game roaming the highlands outside of the Shroud, all of which can be auto attacked to death.  

COMBAT

That brings me to combat.  The action combat is smooth, but very very basic, and surprisingly easy.  It's also fairly unbalanced between specs & styles.  

I haven't been able to find any reason to swap between different melee weapon types.  Most weapons do a variety of damage types (slashing, piercing, blunt, etc.)  And unlike a game like Valheim, it's not obvious when a type is strong against a particular enemy.  It feels like you can generally pick any weapon and whack away on any enemy.  That said, melee feels unnecessarily dangerous compared to the ranged options.  

You can generally cheese any enemy from ranged, due to the way you can jump, glide, and terraform your way around terrain.  Most enemies struggle to do anything against you if you're standing on top of a building attacking them from above.  

Bows have serious arrow management issues.  The cost to be a Ranger is far greater than any other play style.  Arrows get expensive to make. 

Mage builds feel broken.  Wands auto attacks are free and do a ton of ranged damage.  Most every enemy in the game seems weak to 1 of the 3 elemental types.  There's little need to even cast mana-costing spells with a staff.  

BUILDING 

Finally, I'd be remiss if I ended my brief early review (88 hours played so far) if I didn't touch upon Enshrouded's voxel-based building and terraforming system.   As a huge Valheim builder, Enshrouded has been fascinating.  

On the positive side, Enshrouded offers: 

- A amazingly diverse array of high resolution textures and materials to build with
- A strong AI that naturally blends materials you place adjacent to each other
- Complete terraforming freedom to build anywhere or punch holes in anything in the game

On the negative side, Enshrouded is limited by: 

- The invisible cubic voxel grid allows for only 1 material to occupy an individual cube of space.  All you can do is play around with putting different blocks next to each other in adjacent cubes to see how the AI blends them together.  Because you're restricted to these blocks, you cannot ""manually place"" a piece ""in between"" these block spaces for more precise placement, such as centering. 
- Every build piece currently only operates on 90 degree rotations.  No circles, no caddy-corner entryways, no octagonal towers.  Attempts to try to build on angles requires staggering cubes at an angle, which, much like Minecraft, looks extremely choppy, expecially in contrast to Enshrouded's otherwise beautiful, smooth textures.  
- Having only 45 degree roof pieces feels similarly limiting

CONCLUSION

Issues notwithstanding, Enshrouded is a ton of fun already.  I am having a blast exploring the world, although I think I've burned out on that recently due to open world quest fatigue that has carried over from other games.  The building is impressive, but frustrating at times.  I'm hopeful with solid tweaks over the coming years, Enshrouded can develop into a truly magnificent first-of-its kind combination of games.  I look forward to keeping tabs on this game in the future.",1708545456,1708545456,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I was bought and completely invested in it in the first 10 hours of gameplay.
Extremely well polished and the building system is beautiful, there was not a second that I lost my nerve with it and no negative thought came to mind while playing it.
It's good and it has potential to be even better.

THERE IS A GLIDER IN THE GAME WOOO!!!

P.S. 

Add eternal arrows for ranger or make them faster/easier to craft ASAP.

I enjoyed the game but building left me with little reason to do so. The building mode is great and I love the way everything fits together. But, why build? I never had any need to build more than absolute essentials to progress.

If they added some kind of raid or homesite attack, that would change it up a bit. But until then, it’s a beautiful home builder for taking pictures.

The other thing is that combat is good but needs some adjusting. Magic is just too easy to be OP  in comparison to where ranged comes in and melee does not carry its weight. Hopefully they adjust some values on the skill tree (and not nerf magic, but enhance melee and ranged).

Its a pure cheese fest that you can just relog over and over to get legendary weapons.  It breaks immersion completely..  I know I know , I can choose to not play that way but I am a gamer and Im going to game.  
The devs have to fix this.  It's going to kill replayability.

It's a huge world to explore with an interesting quest progression for tech.  The survival and crafting systems are fine and work well for this game.  The RPG skill tree is interesting though could use a bit of work.  The Shroud mechanic is interesting and adds a layer that helps this game shine.

So why don't I recommend it?  I call it the Balder's Gate 3 effect.  BG3 EA was playing the same thing over and over and sometimes missing a fix or improvement because you didn't want to go back and do it again after playing the lesser version over and over.  Dynamic EA games (Like Valheim or Oxygen not Included) feel like a new game after every major patch but static content games tend to drag and any major issue that causes people to start from scratch tend to lose players rather than invigorate them.   Is there anything Keen Games can do to change this opinion for me?  Yes.

The company needs to release a Roadmap to 1.0.   If not a general timeline then at least a content focus plan.  Are they planning on  just finding and fixing bugs and balance or is there a good amount of content still to come?   Seeing the plan will give people an idea on when they are willing to put effort into the game without missing out on what they like.  This game looks like it has a few hundred hours of content.  I'd like to experience the 1.0 for at least 40 of those.

Enshouded, V Rising, Valheim all use similar progression systems but all have the same problem: You get to end-game in about 30-50 hours and theres literally nothing left to do! After doing all the quests in Enshrouded and building your ideal base(s), You will want to test your mettle against maybe an optional world boss? Or random endless dungeons of somekind? Maybe engage in some kind of pvp? Nah none of that in this game. You'll just be in the empty boring ass world with your glider and level 25 armor set regardless of if you play it with friends or not.For whatever reason in all their brillance, these developers still haven't figured out the end-game loop replayability part of these games. And that is what i want to help you possibly avoid if you aren't into that.

Play this game later when they release a bunch more content and is actually worth your time.

Also, this is my first review as a Curator, so nice meeting you all. As I said before, my name is Ben, I’m from Hungary and 34 years old. I like playing games as a hobby, but enough about this, and let’s get into the nitty-gritty.

TL;DR: Great game, with amazing graphics, choices, talents, mobs, weapons and armor. 
As you progress you get to know the story, but it still feels a bit unfinished in my opinion. 9/10.

Expanded review: 
So, as you can see on my profile(bence0307), I have 100+ hours on this game, and I still enjoy it. Mostly to relax after a hard day. 
What I love about this game is that it reminds me of the combination of Minecraft + Breath of the Wild (Zelda). You can travel, you can venture forth into the wild, and into the Shroud. 
When you first ‘awake’ in the game, you basically don’t know anything about the world, what happened? Who’s the bad guy? You just see this shroud across the land, and as you progress further and further, you’ll get a glimpse of the story, and history of Embervale. 
To survive, you will need a base, a house, and those NPC’s that you will have to save in the game. 
There is no real “guided” path to walk to, there are quests that you should be doing to advance your armor and weapons, but the best ones will be coming from chests. 
Story wise, I would give it an 8.5/10 because the game is still in Early Access, and I feel like there are things that have not been implemented in the game, and there are still secrets, and places out there that need to be explored. 

Talents:
What I really enjoyed about this game, that whether you play solo, or in a group (Yes, I am aware that Keen Games have also said that the Game is meant to be played in a group), you can still choose more than 1 talent tree that you go for, you can mix and match till your heart – or in this case, your talent points -, content. 
While mostly I would say it is perfect in every way, I do have to address that Warriors cannot use two 1 handed swords/axes at the same time, and I think that is a missed opportunity there so far, and I hope the developers will implement this as well. 
Another thing that kind of bugs me, are the arrows. You see, to shoot arrows, you got to craft/have arrow on you, always, while the Mage can craft an ‘Eternal’ spell and that spell becomes infinite, which I don’t really find fair in my books. I think there should be an arrow that you can either find or craft, that gives you an unlimited arrow. Or an arrow that you can command, just like in the Guardians of the Galaxy.
I must give it an 8/10 because of it. 

Graphics:
The graphics are spectacular. Everything is Lush and beautiful. I’m playing on an RTX 3060 and can enjoy the game on the highest settings. 
While I understand that due to the story wise there is no water in the game. I would love to make a pond, a lake, or small river at my base. 
So, I’m giving it a 9.5/10.

Playability:
By playability I mean how hard is the game. 
To me who loves these kinds of games, it felt natural, and easy to understand everything. The ranged weapons are a bit harder, but not that much. Takes a bit of practice. 
I think some areas have too many enemies at once, which can be a challenge, even if you play as a tank on Solo. That could be investigated, but I would not give them a penalty for it, because on some things, you just must think it through again, and go at it again. Just like some bosses. 
10/10. 

Misc.:
There are some puzzles, in Temples, and other locations that I shall not spoil. 
The base building is fun and easy, but hard to master.  My only “critique” is that makes it more variety, both in tools that I can put down, and more materials I can use.
I love the farming part of it as well. There is something calming when you go adventuring, and when you return, your crops are all matured, and ready to harvest. 

If you have read it this far, congratulations! I know it’s a long one. 
I hope it helped you in some way, and if you have a thought about it, let me know. 

I hugely approve of this game, and could recommend it to any ages.

I hope to update them in the future but no promises. Regardless, I think this game is really well thought out. Graphics are beautiful even with performance issues, and the shroud mechanic adds a layer of difficulty and interest compared to other adventure games. Little slow in the beginning, but that might be more personal due to playing faster paced games. This is definitely a recommended purchase.

Storage
- I really don't like how you need building materials in your backpack to use them. If your in the boundary of the flame alter you should be able to access them automatically in build mode regardless of magic chests. The magic chests should be repurposed to act more like Ender Chests in Minecraft where no mater what flame alter you are at you can get those materials in a ""global"" chest tied to player ID.

Adventuring
- Sleeping bag outside building area, campfires are kinda meaningless without this especially since they are one time use. I end up carrying around a flame alter, fireplace, and bed mattress instead.

Food
- Cooking multiple foods, or a stack of a single food source, should be easily available from the very start of the game. The cooking pot progression even though it is obtained early should come earlier. Cooking food is a chore until this is obtained. 

Lockpicks
- Why do I need to lockpick a door again after I already opened it?

Material
- Tree tap for resin, or increase resin drop rate. This is one of the more annoying comfort items to obtain in the game.

Map
- Please allow players more freedom to zoom out and zoom in more

Skills
- Stamina penalizes close combat more than ranged, and this is to be expected, but this means close combat builds may need buff to be relevant late game. Survivor skills is mandatory late game for melee builds. Kind of annoying if you just want to focus melee. 
- Wands need auto aim nerf, its way to powerful

Production
- Why does Kiln not have same Recipes as Charcoal Kiln, the regular Kiln should be an ""Improved Kiln""

Controller Keybinds
- Dismantle should not be mapped to the same button as interact
- Dismantle should not display before interact action

Bugs
- Placing alter down before quest completion in the same area can lead to quest bug, this also leads to location duplication in Journal Menu and on Map
- Having another window open on PC severly slows down game. Should work to make this seemless.
- Sometimes equiping another piece of equipment has status lag. Will show unequipped even though its selected in the charecter menu",1708189699,1708533374,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It has become my Minecraft 2.0 and I am looking forward to more blocks and building options in the future. The game is fun, sometimes I grit my teeth, but it never spoiled the fun in any way. 

Pros:
- It's fun to explore and find little nooks and crannies and landmarks , that do reward you with a chest or a page or something.
- The Building Tool is absolutely fantastic and leaves room for immense creativity 
- It's not too grindy undless one wants to build elaborate structures without cheat mods
- The setting and atmosphere is fantastic
- huge world to explore

Cons:
- With all the exploration, the loot really falls short. Looting useless granades over and over and over and over again takes out the fun from scavaging.
- End-game Metal scraps. Remember how you had to grind so hard in the beginning to get metal scraps? Well in the end game you will barely find any other loot than that. Sorry, it is uncreative, boring and feels absolutely repetetive. 
- Large City loot is just... it's not fun. Playing a survival games meet scavaging and looting, so naturally in a large city you think ""oh yeah, lots of nice loot"". .. no... not in this game... not once.. and i find it frustrating 
- Bugs... I mean literal Bugs... the blue ones...sheeeesh I hate them ^^

- Better and much diverse and creative loot distribution, so the cool loot is not ""farmable"" in the same spots.

Enshrouded is truly amasing in both. It is a beutiful game with a lot of wonderful views to explore.
I cant even start to descibe how free the building system is. I would say think the possibilities of minecraft but with today's age of graphic!

The fighting is realy fun and feels verry fluid.
You have all the classic things you would want from character building, like the classic stats dex, int and so on. The skill tree feels like an easier version of games like PoE and Wolcen with i personally appreciate.
You can choose to spend your skill points as a classik tank, wizard, healer and ranger but you can also mix and match and still make it viable, witch is a big bonus from me.

easy to understand and play, giving you enough of an insight into game mechanics thru tips without being too intrusive/ott!

the cooking is fun and the crafting, and everything is just fun!
i even found a few cool weapons!
i will say tho that the combat isn't exactly winning any awards. but at the same time i don't mind it. its there and its enough, but its definitely not fluid or souls like or anything like that!

honestly for all the game that is here already i am plenty satisfied overall!

It's dark, gritty and tells the story of a dark medieval fantasy world destroyed by human nature, wrapped in visually lush environments, from plains, mesa or forest, to the alien world of it's namesake, you follow the paths and find yourself captivated by the narratives of the stories you find along the way. 
Enshrouded is a casual survival crafting based game and definitely has some elements of the typical Valheim-like DNA of most games in it's genre. The crafting system is as you would expect but the building system is definitely an acquired taste with awesome potential.

If you not a reader, like how I was when I started, it doesn't affect your enjoyment of the game. The combat system is fun with basic blocking and stamina system and the animations are still quite nice. 
I found with the more I played, the more compelled I was to read about the story and lore, especially when I hit the black cauldron story, which I think also highlights how interesting the game actually was.

For all of my praise of Enshrouded, I definitely did have some gripes with the game and want to share them in the review:
- The ambient sounds often do not have anything to do with world events, which to me cheapens the overall  environments. If I'm hearing growling, footsteps or a tree breaking, I expect for an enemy to be nearby, something to be nearby or a tree falling.
- The weapon grades. If yellow is better than blue, I don't want it to be useless in 10 minutes. Nor for another 10 minutes after that to be outclassed by a common class weapon. Maybe a way to upgrade weapons in the future would be nice? 
- A certain boss has a pit I could not find a way out of and did not know he was there. As a result. I lost a bunch of stuff that I could not retrieve. I want the freedom to leave a fight that there is no sign of. This could be me not having eyes, hands or a gamer brain though.
- Some common enemies felt like they were harder than bosses.
- I think many materials need larger stacks or the ability to stack more as you upgrade chests.
- 2H weapons are simply not that viable. 
- Mobility skills are locked to the same tree as actual skills, and the points to progress through the skill tree are on a limited amount of points per run, so you have to choose.
- I'd like some cuter decorations for housing. 
- I'd like some more explanations in game, such as the fast travel spires and why you should craft a magic chest over a normal chest.

This isn't a comprehensive list nor is it really anything but my personal opinion. I'm not a dev nor is this my game. The direction of the game is good and they clearly have good oversight. Sorry for a long and yappy review, but I hope this has been an interesting read :) Please don't try and make this game more sweaty or grindy!

My wife and I have been playing in our own world together and it has completely taken our time away from other games, even other hobbies. Exploring is fun, leveling yourself is meaningful, looting is (for the most part) exciting, and so much more. I could go ON and ON about all the good of the game, so I will leave some things that I do not like and hopefully the devs can see it:

1. Server-based progression vs. player-based progression. As I have said, I play with my wife and we only play with each other, so this hasn't been an issue for us, but most people it sucks progressing without your friends and they miss out on stuff.

2. Inventory management. PLEASE give us the option to drop an item. Needing to delete items from inventory just to craft a certain item has me spending time deciding which item I need to sacrifice. This is especially angering when you are crafting a consumable that you will just use up right away anyways. Also, if you want to grab a specific amount of items from your inventory/chest, you have to split the piles into half and repeat until you get what you want. The only work-around for this is gifting a nearby friend one by one and having them re-gift the items back to you. This shouldn't be that hard of a fix.

3. Building is a little bit wonky. The snapping isn't favorable, and the non-snapping placement means you sometimes have to feather where you want to place an item. And for the LOVE OF GOD PLEASE let us place walls, floors, etc. in less than 90-degree increments. Building single block angles takes so long and doesn't look as good as a smooth wall.

4. Craftables versus Looting items. As of the current state of the game, it takes FAR more resources and time to create weapons/armor for your character that are only always weaker than items you can loot in the wild. With the current level-cap at 25, I am only seeing craftable armor up to level 23, while lootable armor/weapons can be up to level 25. This sucks because the design and the perks of the craftables are so cool, so having the choice to choose what I would be better.

5. NPC's that can work. There's been plenty of recent and past games where the NPC's could actually complete certain tasks for you at a certain rate. Many games, such as Palword, Medieval Dynasty, and Conan Exiles have added this feature to their games which make it so fun to assign NPC's to gather certain materials while you're out adventuring. I understand this would be HARD to implement by this point, however.

OVERALL, the game is extremely fun to play and worth the price. It definitely is still in it's early access stage, as you can reach max level rather quickly (40 hours on record once I reached 25).",1708498852,1708498852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The RPG elements are a welcome addition to this sort of game, but they do need a good amount of work. A lot of enemies are too easy and support builds lack nuance (as an MMO tank I may be biased towards this critique though). The world and story itself are very compelling and I actually found myself quite excited when I found a lorebook laying around. Once some updates containing performance patches and difficult enemies are released I think this will be my definitive survival game to play with friends.",1706338741,1708489823,True,1,0,0.4424019455909729,0,True,False,True

Enshrouded is a survival rpg that feels very intuitive right off the bat. Combat feels good and enemy variation feels good. It's not a survival game that requires you to eat, drink or sleep just to survive, but those things enhance your gameplay. The game has harder areas but it's very non-linear. If you want to try to get up to the furthest tower in a far off desert where everything one shots you, you can, but the upside is that risk is rewarded with new items to craft and possibility of higher end loot (which there is no level requirement. you can equip higher level gear at any level). There are also checkpoint flame alters that you will spawn at if you die so you don't have to trek all the way from your base when you die.

Food and recipes are fun to chase because they can greatly enhance particular stats you're looking for- speaking of stats; the game has a pretty simple attribute system and the talent tree really makes you feel like you can specialize well in a class or hybrid class. I'm in sort of a survival/hunter class which makes my bow very fun to use, and gives me some nice perks like extra zoom, slow fall shooting, and chance to shoot extra arrows.

The towers and some dungeons have fun puzzles in them which gives it that Zelda factor. When you do descend into the shroud it has a very eerie Stranger Things vibe, and monsters can pop out of the mist at any time. When I did the Pike and the giant Wyvern popped out, it scared the shit out of me then annihilated the shit out of me.

With the mindset that this game is in early access and is going to be adjusted as time goes on just know that I feel like this game has incredible potential, my critiques are as follows - After spending 45 hours in the game there are a couple of things that stand out that I currently find nagging.

Magic chests only work on crafting through vendors - if it's possible to implement a way to allow any system that requires materials to complete to pull from a magic chest within a flame altar's reach, it would be a gigantic improvement to make magic chests that also allowed the hammer to pull materials or a flame altar to pull stored materials for upgrades.

The bronze age kills advancement, to an almost detrimental degree. There is a fluidity that gets lost here and I believe it begins with crafting bronze bars. 1 bronze bar costs way too much to be viable (60 tin ore x 14 copper ore)  and takes away from that portion of the game. You're almost able to skip right over it completely because of this, you might die a lot to do it, but it will still be faster than trying to outfit your character in bronze gear. I jumped my way through to get iron gear before I even sniffed the bronze equipment, and that was with the help of a friend who did fight through the grueling process of grinding the bronze out.

As the game is now, I think it's definitely worth the money I paid because there is a lot that I have yet to do and I have seen the enshrouded team making small adjustments as time has gone on to improve the experience so I'm hoping there will be some consideration in these areas I touched on above moving forward.",1708483204,1708483204,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Build using individual blocks or with patterns. The building uses a system called vortex that recreates a seamless texture with other blocks as well as terrain, very impressive stuff. 
- A game that feels like a mix of Valheim and Baldurs Gate 3. 
- Level up your base via its ""flame altar""/fast travel point. this allows you to pass thorough the levels of shroud difficulty.
- the shroud is a hostile area that has an upgradable time limit before certain death.
- Food grants buffs/ debuffs in instant and passive forms
-potions for more practical healing and regen for battles
-staffs run on charges similar to a bow and arrow count in addition to a mana bar that gets used. although you can find eternal spells that are infinite charge uses.
-Quests are brought up in the manner of upgrading your craftsman. 5 craftsman with like 4-5 quests that bring new gear and building essentials. this is just grindy enough and encourages progression unlike what other games have tried and have resulted in a grind for pointless things just to get one useful item. the small grind brings plenty of upgrades that are rewarding.
-enemies are tanky and hit hard. they are faster than you as well. play like elden ring and roll roll roll with the slices.
- they have magic chests to dump resources in and can use at any craftsman without having to pick them up manually.
My main issue is the optimization, I've had luck using NVIDIA control panel to manipulate the settings and force certain things to reach a ""stable"" 45 frames on lower-high end graphics; certain places pull me down to 20fps... lighting shaders are buggy on dusk and dawn but the ray tracing works wonders when its smooth.

Decent graphics, physics and controls.

I feel the game breaks shortly after the starter area.
There is a lack of transition from the starter area to the next area.
The starter area seems to be too large and easy and then the next area seem to be way too difficult.
The game lacks direction in advancement. The game throws too many tasks/quests at the player at the same time with no guidance on how/which order to complete them. The game will assign quests to the player that are physically impossible to reach in game, due to terrain or red mist. The game also has two versions of ""red mist"", one is immediately fatal, the other is not, but they both look the same.

I feel that a good game will provide direction. A player should not have to go to an external source to figure out how to advance within the game. 

I feel the game is fun at the start but quickly becomes unplayable.

Maybe through patches and fixes it will become playable past the beginning.

Here's to hoping.....

PROS/POSITIVES:
- Responsive Combat- Combat itself is relatively fluid. The movement, attacks, and different weapon types feel pretty good to use. 
- Lots to Explore- For it only being in Early Access (as of this review) there is a lot to do and a lot to explore. The map is expansive and will likely offer a couple hundred hours worth of exploration by the time of the full release. 
- Solid Class Offerings- There are a quite a few ways to play through the game and build your character (from tank, to more of a fighter, to healer, to assassin, and more). Coupled with different ability bonuses from the various armor sets, it allows you to mix and match to find a build that works for you (along with the ease of re-specing at flame altars)
- Fun Crafting- Crafting and World Editing feel pretty smooth, with the ability to toggle ""snapping"" on and off. Additionally, there is a solid variety of materials for where the game is currently at and there are a lot of different structures and decorations to build. Additionally, the ability to modify terrain in your home bases allows for some unique bases (such as Hobbit holes). 

CONS/NEGATIVES:
- Repetitive Enemies, Combat/Abilities, and Dungeons- Currently there are not a lot of enemy types, meaning that the combat gets very predictable and repetitive fairly quickly. Additionally, while there are a few fun abilities, there is not a ton to do in combat. Additionally, some of the areas (camps, Elixir Wells, etc.) felt very similar in design--would be nice to have greater variety there. 
- Largely Pointless Loot/Chests- 95% of the loot dropped by enemies, as well as found in chests is relatively useless. Loot doesn't really scale with enemy level or area, with (current) end game enemies dropping basic items like ""metal scraps"" and ""torn cloth."" That limits the desire to continue combat in higher level areas. Along with that, most of the chests in the game will be pretty basic, offering only bombs or arrows--with silver and gold chests having almost all of the worthwhile loot. In a game centered around exploration and combat, having few rewards for both takes away the desire to explore and fight. 

SUGGESTIONS:
- Poise/Ability to Endure Attacks- As someone who played a tank/barbarian hybrid, I was kind of surprised that a simple bite from a beetle could interrupt my attack animations--which was particularly rough when using slower, 2-handed weapons. Unless I missed something, it feels like that should be addressed (to provide additional reason for folks to go for defensive builds). For instance, in either the Barbarian or Tank tree, providing some sort of poise or ability to withstand enemy attacks during your own attack animation. Or, make it so that heavier armors (such as ones from the blacksmith) could allow players to better tank hits and keep swinging.
- More Variance in Skills- It feels like at least 50% of the skill points were just ""increase _____ by 1."" To help each class feel more distinct, it would be nice to have a greater variety of skills available. For instance, expanding the beast master skills to allow animals to be tamed (rather than just kind of charmed). Or if the more ranger/assassin type characters could create and set traps. Ultimately, just adding in even more to help classes feel distinct and give them different purposes in battle. 
- Greater Armor and Weapon Variance- The weapons start to feel very same-y as you go along (with the game offering upgraded versions of many of the same weapons--such as the ""Guillotine"" axe).  It would be nice to see greater variance here and more variance in weapon and armor characteristics (defensive stats, boosts, etc.). 
- Skill Levels for Things Done In World- Since the game does cater well to group play, it would be cool to have skill levels for various things like cooking, crafting, smithing, etc. That would help further flesh out some of the roles people have within their worlds and allow for some fun builds and interactions.  
- Nickname Homes/Bases- When you have multiple flame altars out it can occasionally get a bit confusing (especially if folks are hopping in to visit your world) to find the one you're looking for. It would be a nice, and seemingly simple change to be able to name your homes/bases. 

I'm excited to see where they go with this game and hope they will continue to build upon the strong bones of their Early Access release.",1708480039,1708480039,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Progression seems well balanced in terms of item/ skill improvements measured against the strength and difficulty of the enemies you'll encounter during the main quest lines. 

I do think the combat, especially the melee mechanics could be a lot more versatile and dynamic. A 3 piece combo seems more fitting for a fast food chicken joint than an open world fantasy RPG. Feels like a disservice to the combat side of the gaming adventure. If the devs are lurking and happen upon this review. PLEASE consider adding a few hit combo variations so that there is more than just the 3hit sequence with mouse left-clicking. 

The ability to manipulate the environment, specifically the terrain, is huge for this genre... big ups for that inclusion! dig deep into the ground to mine for minerals... Can't find your way up that mountain....? No worries, grab a pickaxe (or 2, maybe even 3) and start learning how to tunnel vertically through that sheer cliff face, until you reach the grassy top side.

The structure building is awesomely unique from any other game in this genre. I personally have never seen a system like it in a game. It is well organized and makes excellent use of simple controls to swap through the different base materials that result in the texture variants such as stone, wood, metal, ect.. Extremely intuitive, once you understand how to navigate the structure menu. Everything you build can be picked up and recovered, piece by piece too. No loss of materials because a wall or ceiling didn't snap into the right spot! Another thoughtful concession in the player's favor. (repairing weapons is also FREE!)

The quest system can quickly feel overwhelming as you start to acquire more quest givers. This happens surprisingly fast in the earlier part of the game. You will go from 2 or 3 nearby areas dotted on the map, to all the sudden having 8 or 9 areas all over the map pegged with the universal ""?"" quest indicator. There are built-in co-dependencies that will require you to find or build an item for one quest giver, that will allow you to make an ingredient required by another quest giver to finish new gear/ items. Not completely unique to this game, but done in a way that doesn't feel unrewarded or extra grindy.

Tons of features that I could go on about, but I'll end it with a short mention of the class/ skill tree. While it allows you the freedom to hurl fireballs from your mage staff while also going with a typical melee-based heal-on-kill skill option, in the times you aren't sneaking around pretending to be a little rogue-ish. While it does afford you the freedom to multi-class 4 ways from sunday, I can't say I personally recommend it. Although I do appreciate the option if we were to chose that path!",1708479822,1708479822,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I say less bc I spent 5-6hrs one day wasting it on farming / base progression for flax/linen/padding and it really wasnt worth it.

There are no 'wow' moments in the game besides a single boss fight. 99% of fights can be cheesed with ranged attacks. Exploration is fairly weak besides the large towns with very little thought put into some designs (ie, the bridges to the North that are not bridges bc they end on both sides in cliffs and climbing from the valley to the top of the bridge has absolutely nothing around it.) 

Resources are weird and hardly seem required to do anything in the game. Sure rest bonus is nice but hardly needed. Sure better food is nice but grilling meat and drinking water works just fine. Sure crafting armor/weapons seems nice but you find much better weapons/armor out and about. If it wasn't for upgrading the alter to reach new areas, you could very easily beat this without ever building a base past a workbench and campfire. There are also no raids like in Palworld/Valheim.

I broke my early access rule for this and I regret it. Idk why I keep buying early access survival games, i think i got a problem. When Valheim is still in early access many years later I lose all hope for EA survival games like this to actually improve upon the base game or actually ever provide a finished product.

Grind: just a right amount, maybe bit annoying as archer, but overall not too much and not too easy

Combat: tougher than in demo, I think polished just right. And developers are adjusting it further.

There are some annoyances regarding server-shared progression, but they are working to add mode where you could pick if every player wants separate progression.

OH and for some reason my computer lags out whenever theres a sunset. probably a ME issue though. I highly disagree with people saying they can't use magic bc the spells are hard to find, they're not. You eventually can MAKE them and get eternal versions so you don't have to find/craft them again. 
- discovered another bug, after looting something, directional inputs dont work for a second

THINGS ID LOVE TO SEE IN THE FINISHED GAME: 
- Mounts/pets/summon-able monsters to fight with you
-Having one person read a note and it progress quests for everyone (i've been locked out of a few quests because I wasn't nearby when something happened)
- Bigger  and better skill tree with more special abilities rather than just passives
-More marker icons
-Reticle in the middle of the screen
-Rounded building blocks (right click to round a placed block?)
-Different ways to sort an inventory with a button, not just one way
-IMPROVED WAND/ WAND RANGE THAT SH*T SUCKS  ~ ! ! ! ! I can't hit anything more than two feet away!!! I know it says mid-range but its more like peewee poopoo range.
- Prebuilt structures shells for bases (unless thats already in the game and I haven't unlocked it yet)
- LANTERN YOU CAN CARRY ON YOUR PERSON (the wisp lasts far too short)
- More enemy types! 
-Dyes for clothing
-Ability to label chests somehow, or signs in general
-DIFFICULTY SETTING, ITS TOO EASY SOMETIMES
-Even more decorations!!! 
-More upgrades for weapons/ or give a reason to want to keep an older one that looks cool
-even more secrets/hidden things to find that are worth finding!
-Make it clearer that upgrading your base will make you able to venture into the red shroud
-mini bosses
-MAKE WATER EASIER TO GET IT TAKES FOREVER.
-better inventory management overall, like tabs for specific types of items or something
-More spells for the staff, I think the staff is a little lame to use, it does a lot of damage but it feels kinda bad to use?
-armor upgrades

---I'll add more to this list as I think of them! 

P.S - I'm only 23 hours in atm so if any of this is in the game already MB!!!

This game has got amazing basebuilding, good combat, wonderful exploration, A quest system and its just a blast to play :)

Really for me its a mix of Valheim with its Coop play, basebuilding, exploring,etc.... but it also reminds me of the Gothic/Risen games by PB with how rewarding the exploring is and how fun it is to explore this game world.

Playing solo atm but after many hours hours I can already tell this is going to be one that I want to play on a dedicated server in the future with the same friends I played Valheim with on a dedicated server.

This game has better combat, has a great quest system and I love that you can add NPC's to your base, while Valheim i liked the atmosphere, art design more and of course the great randomly generated maps. Both have wonderful and creative basebuilding and how you can manipulate the ground so well to.

Played many a Survival games over the years and this game is up there with the best imo and so far only behind Valheim all time :)

Check this game out asap, it is super fun, relaxing and it handles good on both keyboard and mouse and on a controller.

Two huge thumbs up so far!

I played the demo for this previously to, but I am liking the EA version alot more so far!

Other survival games I have enjoyed are Valheim, Minecraft, Grounded and Conan Exiles. Enshrouded is up there with Valheim & Minecraft for me as my top 3 in the genre.

PS: Now a good 20 hours into the game and it only gets better and better! So much to explore, amazing basebuilding and its just a blast.

PSS: It is Very fun in BOTH Solo play and Coop with a friend(s). Early Game Of The Year contender for me, gives me everything I want in a Survival/Valheim style game (And in many ways it is better than Valheim, which I was not expecting).",1706125848,1708476348,True,6,0,0.606960594654083252,0,True,False,True

With the understanding this is month 1 of early access: The combat balance is *WAY* out of whack.  
There's quite a few things that will one shot you even if you have the best gear available to you.   This could be because of the following:
Leveling is *INSANELY* slow.  To get from level 2 to 3 took several hours.  By level 6 or so, we've done everything to the point where we have to go into area filled with lvl 11-15 creatures.  Some of the lvl 15's are reasonable and fair... then there's the ""Dual acid axe wielding maniac"" who chains attacks endlessly, even if you parry/block him.  Worse, he takes 75% of my max health with each hit.
Then there's the lizard boss that had undodgable/unblockable one-shot hits... And mortars that would kill you, even if it was impossible for you to get hit by them.
Etc.
The skill tree looks like a bunch of placeholders.  They're all *really* bad.

I played my first run with my friend and we ""speed ran"" the game, which means we were fighting mobs 2-5 levels above us, the next thing you know we are maxed at level 25, and I was still using level 13 gear, and as a tank that was dreadful. I've since played a solo and have spent roughly 120 hours exploring, finding resources all over the place, and taking my time to really enjoy this game. I'm hopeful of where the game goes from here. All in all well worth the price, and the coop play is great. There's some changes coming that address some big wants, when it deals with questing, and that will really make having friends join you even if they never played feel much nicer without having to start your server anew.

Above 60fps is fake, the game stutters and continues to run at 60 while reporting more fps.

It's also a read simulator and I just refuse to read in games cause I'd rather read a book. I do not like the crafting people, they're annoying and the game does not let you have them instantly.

There are, however, some irritating QOL things that need fixed:
 

Some of the boss hitboxes really need work, and the whole dodge/parry mechanic could really use tightened up, as well as obvious AI improvements. Combat does not feel particularly engaging or difficult, (though can often be arbitrarily punishing, randomly one-shotting you on a hit you didn't have a reasonable chance to dodge or block, often from mob enemies), which is where this game takes a large step back compared to its predecessors, namely valheim and breath of the wild. 


This game really needs to continue its performance improvements. Its playable but it has pretty significant frame drops. the one that really gets me is when I open the map, fps drops into the single digits for some reason.

Also could we just try pausing the game in single player? It would help me get around said frame drops when in combat as well, and also just make the game more playable as a parent who needs to step away sometimes. Its frustrating to need to quit out when I have to walk away, just to log back in and find I'm automatically sent back to my base after logging out.

- The Tera Forming is one of the coolest gameplay mechanics I've seen.
- The adaptive building components are an awesome system. You can get really creative with combination with the above and the result is almost always beautiful. For any base builders this game is a must!

Recommendations:
- Implement more Physics based aspects of the gameplay (reactive environment  etc.)
- Combat dynamics are a bit off. Parry enemy attacks feels too weak and hard to execute.
- Zone reset is way too fast. Sometimes it feels that you don't leave impact over the land. You can farm the same vein spots and its way to easy to exploit the environment.
-  The Fast-travel is too accessible. After Valheim I understand more clearly how important traversing the map is.

Desperately needs first person mode though. Progression is nicely laid out, it can feel non-linear. You recruit ""professionals"" similar to getting ""slaves"" in Conan exiles, they double as quest givers and your primary crafting benches. they send you to get items (weapons, armor, or accessories) recipes (New building blocks, special armors) or secondary benches.  In terms of crafting, it's pretty basic and honestly any weapons or armor you craft tend to be replaced by armor and weapons you find in the world.  I think I only crafted one set of armor, every upgrade then on was from chests, enemy drops or side quest rewards. The resource cost late game grows exponentially, making it clear it wasn't meant to be played solo. There is currently a major issue with the amount of feathers/twigs needed for arrows, even the most basic arrows you are grinding for an hour to make arrows to use them in 15 minutes.

As you beat bosses and collect sparks you can upgrade your flame altars' level, increasing how big your base can be, how long you can stay in the shroud, and a stat buff.  These altars work as safe and save zones, spawn and fast travel points. they also clear the 'Shroud' from the area. Any chunk of the world outside of a altar resets when no one has been nearby for 30 minutes. Aside from some world progression stuff like clearing a shroud mushroom or well, which can clear it's surroundings. If you don't put one down and log off, your entire world resets back to 0. If you destroy one in your base and log off or leave the area for 30 minutes byebye base.  This can be an issue with open public servers as people can grief and delete your altar. Currently don't make your base by a bee hive, or at least don't harvest it. There's a glitch where if you harvest a hive inside your altar range it'll start to infinitely spawn honey which will crash your game. Nice thing though is you can teleport between your altars at will as long as your not in the shroud. Higher level altar gives more additional altars.

The game is definitely more of an RPG with craft/survival dropped on top. The world is custom crafted not a lot of random gen or ai gen.  You can honestly play the game without building a base. Old time friend clay pots and barrels drop a good amount of resources on break, so exploring and tearing apart ruins tends to give more resources then doing normal resource runs(exemption being ore, arrow mats and some food stuffs.). Almost every POI has its only little secrets, There was this morning looking farmhouse with a collapsed shed out back, So I threw some bombs at the rubble and it opened up an entire basement that led into a dungeon. Decent variety of places and some random mini-bosses sprinkled in.  Each region has a tower that you can climb by doing a navigating through puzzles and traps. Also a good source of potions. Once beat they mark local POIs. You can teleport to the top of the tower afterwards and be able to glide to most of that regions POIs, this is your main method of ""fast"" travel. Sun temples and Flame temples, sun temples are the current end game dungeons, hard mobs and good loots. Flame towers are just special collection points, no enemies, chests just a 'Spark' which you need multiple each time you want to upgrade your flame altar.
The combat, this is honestly were enshrouded needs the most work. The PoE type of skill tree where your options were plenty, big complaint here is I left a few of the perks should of been base game not a perk to go after. Double jump while isn't mandatory, your are gimping yourself not taking it same with glider boost perk. Melee combat right now is in a terrible state, stagger mechanic is poorly implemented, parrying and blocking can feel unresponsive. There is no wind up or tell for almost any melee attack, So many times where I would parry, block or break their block, which should make an opening for me to attack, only for it not even phase them. Melee fighters have little to no way of fighting flying creatures with out some investment into range which takes away slots and skill points needed to progress melee skill tree. Speaking of that one of the main skills for melee is a special punishing attack for when you break their stagger bar which either doesn't happen(stagger issues above) or the mob is already dead.  Archers are in a good place aside from the arrow issue above, with arrows being easier to make and maybe a little buff in damage they would be well balanced. Magic how ever is over tuned like crazy.  You can get some really good mana regen rings early which takes the challenge from maintaining mana away completely. So unlimited use, the spells do the most dmg in the game, one of them nearly able to one shot most enemies at short range.  The skill tree for mages is so packed with goodies, blink which you can get a perk that lets you have a get out of stun free card, a passive aoe aura that heals allies and another that damages enemies and one that makes wands shoot double projectiles. Did I mention wand projectiles have insane tracking, 360 no scope, no problem.  As I played solo I couldn't test out of the aggro mechanics, there were skills designed to draw more aggro to the tank or skills to relieve aggro from mages/ranger, or the ally buffed or healing that other skills accomplish. I like the idea of the holy trinity.

World progression and character progression are separate, similar to Valheim. The map is HUGE, currently only 1/4 to 1/3 of it is playable and its already bigger then palworld's.  Unlike Valheim which lags like crazy once you start terminating, enshrouded doesn't, you could build the mines of Moria or spend 30 minutes tunneling through a mountain because you didn't want to walk around and you would see little to no performance issues. 

Half of the map is covered in a fog called the shroud which is at first an interesting mechanic, but now I have more conflicting opinion on it.  It gives a sense of urgency in the beginning of the game, but honestly its just an underwater breathe mechanic without the annoying movement. It becomes mostly just a very mild annoyance by half way into EA.  Depending on gear, consumables and your flame altar level depends on how long you can stay in the shroud, once the timer hits zero you die. The shroud has different levels, if it red it means you need to upgrade your flame altar to be able to go there without instant death. There are some places you can clear the fog by completing POIs, or placing a flame altar but placing an altar can also bug it out so all the fog on the map goes away.

But unfortunately this game makes the same mistake Valheim made: even though the focus should be on exploration, dungeon crawling, and especially base-building, the entire experience hinges on boss fights. Access to new zones and materials is gated behind boss fights that are an incredibly stark contrast to the rest of the game—nightmarish bullet sponges that attack way faster than your clumsy, animation-cancels-are-for-wimps Souls wannabe character. It didn't make sense in Valheim, it doesn't make sense here. All the Youtube videos are about making a cool house, but it's clear the game doesn't value that aspect half as much as three hundred consecutive successful dodge rolls. 

That said, it's prettier than Valheim by far, the world is hand-crafted and of manageable size as opposed to Valheim's colossal, procedurally generated shithole, and there's a greater emphasis on finding loot, and exploring distinct locations. In many ways it's more rewarding than Valheim and other similar games in this space. But like so much of the industry it's beholden to the curse of FromSoft design.

Honestly, if I could just skip the boss fights I'd love this game. As it is I only play it with other people because—and I cannot understand how in the year of our Lord 2024 game developers are still doing this—it simply doesn't account for how many people are in your party and is an un-fun slog if you're solo.",1708466729,1708466729,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm so glad I got this game. $30 was definitely worth it. It's so beautiful and full of surprises, and the world is HUGE! I've only played solo so far (because I like to build and explore on my own time) but look forward to playing with some friends once they get it. I'm mostly into it for the casual crafting and exploration vibe, plus the magic. I LOVE the amount of freedom and ease in base-building. Finding new materials to build and craft with scattered around is awesome. 

 I do have some frustrations with it in its current form:

Perk points are scant and often perks need more than 1 which makes it reeeeal slow to power up a character, which is unfortunate because...
THE ENEMIES DEAL TOO MUCH DAMAGE. There is no reason that 3 rats should be able to silently ambush and kill a level 5 player in 5 seconds. Pretty much any mob can kill you in 3 hits, even with armor on, which is just ridiculous. Maybe make a difficulty selector for players who want to focus more on the casual crafting and exploration side, or offer more powerful armor boons.

Also, from an accessibility standpoint, the enemies often don't make any sound whatsoever until they're already attacking, which makes it even easier for an enemy to surprise and almost kill you with one attack combo. Some footsteps or other movement sounds would be great.

Ammo for magic staffs is a weird choice being that it uses mana as well - and a lot of it (which regens super slow, making lots of mana potions a necessity as well)... I would understand if you could either craft the bolts to not use mana, or just use mana with one of the eternal spells, but both is overkill, and just generally doesn't make sense. It's magic, after all. I'm very thankful that the eternal frost bolt made its appearance quickly.

The wisp potions are a great way to get around without needing to hold a torch all the time, but the bloom/ lit fog around them makes it hard to see, and until you get the mortar to make them (which is quite a hike from the starting point or even the first fast-travel spire) they are pretty rare to find.

as a QoL feature, it would be wonderful to be able to extinguish a base flame from the map view, anywhere.

I don't know what it is about the item selection on the controller (both the D-pad way and the rotational version), but MANY times when I've been in battle and need to switch to a potion or another weapon quickly, it will select a completely different item instead of the item I want to select.  This has resulted in many deaths (: I have also sat down during battle many times because D-pad down is bound to 'sit' by default.

I know it's more of a getting-used-to-the-key-bindings sort of thing, but it's too easy to undo building from anywhere (even other bases) on accident, and also destroy stuff you've placed in your base on accident.

Some of the crafting doesn't work with the magic chests. It would be great for QoL to be able to pull items required for a selected blueprint/recipe/upgrade from a magic chest like the other crafting does.

Overall, I love this game BUNCHES already, and can't wait to see what the devs have in-store for the future.",1708465601,1708465601,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The content that is available is already impressive, and I am very happy with the engine itself. I haven't personally explored the entire skill-tree -- my plan is to play something different on the next playthrough -- but each of us did feel unique and handled things differently. There's no cookie cutter build that you absolutely 100% have to do.

I was running a dedicated box on my home network. Besides having to re-configure my own router due to some ISP changes (Shaw getting taken over by Rogers), the process was actually pretty painless. They did have an issue with the dedicated server package not being available at launch, but it was fixed in about an hour. The dev team is on it! 

Of the six people I know playing, none of us regret our purchases. My main group had 4 guys that took off work and lived and breathed this game for like 4 days. Nobody in our group had crashing and we were putting in 7+ hours in a session (massive downplay on that number, lol), without any real issue. The group eventually branched off a bit and some people were re-playing areas solo with different characters or playing together on a non-dedicated, but from what I heard the hosted games are fairly responsive too (nothing janky like falling through the world or rubber-banding).

I made bases underground, on top of mountains, and terraformed to my heart's content. Combat is smooth, and all my deaths were really my fault. Some of the mobs are a cakewalk and some of them make you run away screaming ""no no no not him!"" Some of the bosses are laughably easy and some of them are a genuine challenge.

I will state that these thoughts are bearing in mind that the game is still Early Access. 

[h2] Combat: [/h2] 

While I do think the devs have the right idea in regards to the games combat systems, talent tree and weapon types/effects I do think this system could use further polishing as the game develops. Its not terrible by any means, but its equally nothing to write home about, a lot of magic feels relatively weak till later in the game and I do find that most crafted gear came in too late, often the quests to unlock more recipes have you venturing around the world and often times I'd end up far better geared than half the things I'd unlock. 

The games Skill-Tree is a fun concept for a game of this style, as a lover of some older RPG systems I'd love to see the system refined further as currently I don't feel like the tree has many overly unique or interesting choices. I'd rather see a separate talent tree for skills involving crafting/ gathering as well, with my characters combat tree allowing me to unlock more unique abilities in my respective play style over smaller buffs/stat increases. 

The Unique/Legendary weapons are definitely fun to discover, though I would love to see more unique effects or traits added to them as well as some more quests or grind to receiving them. Often these weapons were far better than anything I'd receive for a while (as they should be) the issue was largely how early on/easily I could find one making weapon progression often feel very slow, or worse when I had to part with my favourite weapon. 

[h2] The Building: [/h2] 

I love the building in this game, while we don't have to deal with a support system like Valheim its refreshing to have a more voxel based system to create structures/locations. I understand the desire in having some unique materials being hidden in the world but I would love the game to add a creative mode for those who enjoy the building aspects. As of now the game has no such feature built in. 

At times the landscaping elements can be a bit tricky or act silly but overall it feels good, for those who enjoy building alone this game is definitely a hit in those regards. 

[h2] Other Thoughts: [/h2] 

Overall the game is extremely fun to wander, explore and create within while there are certainly a few features that need remedies such as the talents, combat and crafting unlock progression I do think its a worthwhile game to purchase/play and imagine as it grows further it'll become more and more polished. Already the devs have put up a site to take feedback for wanted new features such as weather, water, livestock and progression features that will definitely make the game feel more immersive.

It is good minecraft, but bad Valheim


long:
some say ""you cannot compare it to Valheim"", oh, boy, i can!

1) Exploring: enshrouded is better here, because of handcrafted world, each POI feels somewhat different from previous one
2) Base building Enshrouded has better creativity because of ""minecraft-like"" voxel-building, but Valheim is better, because of ""physics"". It just feels more interesting to win against physics
3) Battle - Enshrouded has a long way to go, current battleling feels flat, and enemies are really easy, its either ""you rock them all"", or they just outlevel you and two-shot you
4) ""Progression"" - Valheim is just better in every aspect

- Enshrouded has ""levels"" with ""traits"", which sound like :it has to be fun"", but it isn't, on other hand in Valheim at any point of time you lose your equip/food = you are, basically, level 1, and equipment/food system really makes a huge difference, at any point you can jump to your friends, take their equip and rock with them, whereas in Enshrouded if anybody had not enough time to grind levels, they will not be able to do much (even though you also can supply equipment to them)

- Crafting progression in Enshrouded is not thought through for now.
Example: you get ""mortar"" for alchemist on lvl5, now alchemist can craft more stuff for you, but you cannot craft mortar, because resources for mortar are endgame, so if mortar is lost or if players want to have separate bases - well, have fun, or restart server until each person has his own mortar. You can also just ""bruteforce"" all crafting station just by running through the map, Valheim's limit-by-boss feels better.

- Lack of individual progression: if your friends went through the ""quests"", you automatically slack behind, which is just not fun. Also ""global"" flame level also sucks there, because as a ""slow"" player you will constantly feel that you skip content. IN valheim even if your friends completed whole game - you still can gradually go up to them repeating ""individual;"" steps, like kill boss 1 -> go to content #2 -> kill boss #2 -> go to content #3, etc

It feels like whole Enshrouded was created to be played as ""team as 1 person"", who ALWAYS play together, think together, do everything together ALL THE TIME. But in reality my 30y+ buddies just play completely separately

I think Enshrouded (if they'll listen to feedback) will become great game in year or two, until then i would wait before buying/playing",1707048400,1708459321,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I personally experienced no bugs or crashes so far, sad that I have to mention this, yet great that this has not been an issue or atleast for me it was'nt.
 
The character creation system is a little lacking, but most outfits hide more or less all of your character anyway so i would'nt really consider that a major flaw. Additionally i would highly recommend playing this game with other players, as it truly enhances the experience. Yet there is no content that you would necessarily need another player for, so clearing the game solo isn't that difficult either, but you will spend much more time gathering ressources in order to progress with quests or enhancing your equipment.
The biggest problem is for sure the unbalanced fighting system. Using anything that isn't a mage is solo absolutely pointless. Close combat gradually becomes useless as you progress and lategame some enemies are basically invincible, because you can't reach flying enemies. Bows deal mediocre damage and you spend a lot of time farming ressources for arrows. Mages on the other hand gradually get stronger and more versatile as you progress.

The skilltree isn't filled to the brim with meaningless perks, the currently accessible map is definitely not too small, the variety of items and equipment is decent and the building system is enjoyable. There aren't that many different types of enemies, but as they get stronger in higher level areas they don't simply get tankier and deal more damage, but some of them also acquire new abilities and/or are visually different.",1708457294,1708458969,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its also very clearly chinese made, with all characters appearing asian and nothing being quite good enough.

Being a fan of survival games and RPGs, Enshrouded is a nice addition to my collection. It has nice quality of life features that make the game feel less like a job and more like a fun game. For instance, the magic storage containers allow you to craft at your base without the need to have crafting materials in your character's inventory. Another nice QoL feature is the ability to build upon most existing structures and edit them once you build an Altar there. The game has several features going for it that make it fun to play endlessly.

Loot is plentiful and is rewarded for exploration. You are able to acquire plenty of weapons and gear that cater to individual play styles, which pairs nicely with the diverse skill tree, giving you the freedom to build your character however you see fit. 

But when it comes to combat, it can be extremely frustrating, especially the stamina mechanic. It feels like you never have enough, even with the Rested buff, and its regen rate is painfully slow. This can make the difference when fighting groups of enemies, where back stepping isn't enough. You attempt to roll away and either can't, or you only buy yourself a few more seconds before being overcrowded. Some of the enemies also feel very overpowered, even when you match their levels. Not only that, but when you pick up their weapons, they don't do anywhere near the same amount of damage as when you fought them (i.e. the dual Poison Axe wielding enemies). The shield parrying and ability to block is nice, and doesn't drain stamina too hard, although having the durability bar for the shield visible in your HUD instead of checking your inventory would be a nice touch. If you prefer keeping your distance, you're in luck; a Ranger build is insanely overpowered. My best friend uses it and is constantly putting out damage in the 200-300 range, whereas my Legendary Guillotine is doing maybe half that.

The game doesn't have too many bugs but there are some that break the game. Today I drank a potion to extend my time in the shroud, which didn't work, and to add insult to injury, my friend was able to fall and stand in the red deadly shroud floor indefinitely without any sort of buffs. I also was getting stuck between containers and walls frequently, unable to fast travel or do anything to free myself, and I relied on my friends to help. Some optimization is also heavily needed in certain places. Your FPS dramatically tanks when you zoom out on the map and during sunset/sunrise.

All in all, it's fun to play, especially with friends. Well worth $30.

Pros:
-Endless fun in coop mode
-Beautiful graphics and vast landscape
-HUGE, open world map
-Loot is everywhere and all items serve a purpose
-Skill tree is very diverse, and respecing is inexpensive to do

-Combat feels one sided sometimes

1. Traversal options - Getting to locations that don't have any teleport points nearby can be a slog. Not a big issue, but would be nice to see other traversal options (Horse, or maybe some tool to give height to glider that is better than the skill). - I hate to use a another game as a reference, but Revalli's Gale from BoTW would be nice, just limiting its use outside of ""dungeon"" zones.
2. Crafting times - Late game materials can take far too long when you start having to go through multiple processes to get a specific item (Padding, for instance). I'd argue mining also falls under this, as it takes quite a long time just to get enough ore. (Lookin at Bronze here)
3. Farming - Wow, the current system feels awful, as planting is tedious and takes a long time, with rather poor returns on some plants (Looking at you, fibre+twigs).
4. Arrows - On the topic above, farming for twigs feels awful in this game. Arrows need to either be cheaper, or you need to get more twigs from the planted bushes - An improvement to either gardening efficiency (Like planting + harvesting 10x10 all at once) or just improving output would help this.
5. If the above can't be implemented, maybe allow crafting of twigs from wood. Just some way to make crafting arrows to be less of a hassle.
6. The archery skill to shoot multiple arrows - This actually consumes multiple arrows, making you waste arrows. This feels terrible when arrows are so tedious to craft.
7. Nighttime - It gets hella dark, having a craftable lantern, maybe even upgradable, just to provide some light would be great. The torch goes out when gliding, leaving you guessing where you might land.
8. Mining - It's a bit slow, but I understand that it probably needs to be this way to avoid players cheesing everything.
9. Skill points - Breaking the shroud roots don't give other players points if they are not there. This *can* be remedied by just resetting skill points, but it would be nice to have a better system in place for this just to sync up skill points.

Despite these complaints, the game shows great potential, some of the bosses are great (The one in the castle was really fun), and the gliding feels fantastic. The map, while sometimes a bit barren, is still excellent for early access. The grapple feels great, though it could be used a bit more.

Instead of telling you why this is a great game (compare this to valheim directly with better graphics), let me tell you why its bad, and if any of these are dealbreakers, avoid it. Otherwise, this is an amazing game, and you should buy it.

-The skill tree, while functional, is terrible. Its bad enough that id consider it entirely placeholder, but it looks like they've put in too much effort for that. The goal talent for healer is healing allies a little when you die, and most trees seem to have the opposite stats to what they want (wizard in particular). Its not gamebreaking, but its bad.

-Progression doesnt feel that great. Normally in survival, you progress a 'tier' and you get access to a lot of really cool stuff. New bars, new armour, ect. Enshrouded, instead, makes you go out and do a quest for a few recipes at a time, generally requiring multiple to get anything (one to get the bars, one to get some other material, and finally one for the weapons), and by this time, you've likely got better gear than you'd be able to craft off of the ground.

-Similarly, all the weapons you can craft are terrible. You, at least earlygame/midgame, cant craft any gear of rarity, which is required to improve gear. I got a legendary axe near the start, and after another 20 hours and a few tiers up, its still better than anything i can craft. And armour is fairly boring in general, with very little options. You're melee dps? Theres a melee dps set, you dont want any of the others. Ranged? Theres actually 2 sets, but they have the same stats.

-Ranged/mage are very bad early, and for quite a while.

-Combat is quite janky. Enemies seem to attack whoever is closer, meaning that the second you go to attack, they spin around mid combo and hit you, meaning you never really have much chance to hit them in the back. Doesnt always happen either, but enough and with low TTK, that it sucks when playing with other people. Some enemies also give you basically no chance to fight back in melee, as they attack so fast.

The game does feel good though, otherwise. If all these problems are fixed, and they are fixable, the game will be fantastic. Maybe it'll take a while, maybe it wont.

This games check all the boxes: great lore, good combat, massive world with rpg elements, survival crafting and good enemy designs. 

This game keeps me on my feet and the combat isn’t mind-numbing, it’s nice to have to think strategically when attacking camps (at least if you want to fight melee, if not then magic is pretty OP).

My only gripe is the character creation and how empty the world can feel. It’s full of enemies and signs of life, and I totally get that the point is the shroud has just decimated everything so having other random npc’s seems to go against the grain. It’s just a shame because it’s such a big world especially for an early access.

For character creation, it would be amazing to have more options for faces, implementation of eye colour and maybe some tattoos or something for that added bit of spice.

Lastly, optimisation for the Steam Deck would be fabulous. I have adapted my settings to achieve 28fps and balance it with acceptable graphics, but it would be amazing to have this as a game you can play ‘straight out the box’ on the steam deck as it is amazing to play handheld.

This is a brilliant game. For an early access game it already feels very full, I’m excited to see where this game goes!

At just over 100 hours I have now finished all the content in the game, minus a few achievements. I absolutely stand by my original review. This is a fantastic game and the portion that is early access feels very complete until you get to the last few quests which im sure will be added onto as the DEV's continue to work on it. With the class system already in place this will be a fantastic multiplayer game.

Random Things i noticed while playing:
- Not be able to hold the torch in the shield slot makes torch so useless. You always have to switch and why is a torch even in the game when you automatically light areas. Remove that mechanic completely because its fun to have a light mechanic and needing a torch in a dungeon. Light management can be fun if done right. 
- The game lacks uniqueness. Valheim has this northern mythology vibe to it and here its generic fantasy world. The shroud was interesting the first time but it became boring after the 5 mushroom place you walk through that has the same 3 enemies. The game needs an identity that differences it from other games. 
- All melee weapons have the same animation. The animation is not bad but it feels kind of boring after some time. You find a cool new weapon and all it does is the same slashing animation.
- The crafting menu is horrible. It is just a long list. 
- The game lore wants to be this empty dark and destroyed darksouls like world and then you summon some super jacked NPCs and they are just like ""Sup whats up?"". It feels so out of place. Why not find the smith somewhere in a broken castle in a cavern and he is an old men and teaches you the recipes. 
- The game lacks different content. It is not fun to search the fifth ruin with wolves only to once again find the same 5 items you already found in the last ruin you searched.
- Loot from chests is random and it feels so shit. You find a legendary weapon in some random chest and in the chest after a boss fight and a big dungeon you find a grey item. It sucks.
- The glider feels clunky as hell. 
- The game needs a climbing mechanic like conan or zelda. Not be able to climb 5 meters does not feel good
- The food mechanic has the same problems like in valheim. You never have enough stamina and it sucks. Dying in a boss fight because you rolled two times and now don't have enough stamina to roll again is not fun.

I can not recommend it right now. If you are looking for just more generic valheim content this game is for you, if not play something else.",1708443293,1708443500,False,1,1,0.45628589391708374,0,True,False,True

-Building and crafting mechanics are solid, but needs quite a few QOL improvements ie. You cant access you whole stash 
 when  crafting at base, you need to have items in inventory which is tedious. Tools should be equippable on your character like glider and grappling hook, they take unnecessary slots from your task bar 3/5
- The fact that you can build your character with skill points is very nice and creates variety. Combat would benefit from extra spells/actions (something besides LMB, RMB and E). 4/5

I try to think of things I don't like about it and I can't really pinpoint something in particular. I really like the explorations, a big map to discover things. Still, after 50 hours into the game, I have maybe discovered only half of the map. Been taking my time and gathering material and put some time into building. That is also a part that I really like! This games building mechanics are awesome! The small details you can do in buildings. Lots of different materials to build in, lots of different blocks. I think this is one of my favorite game to build in so far. The combat is quite fun too. 

One thing that I can think of that I don't like. When standing in the map menu, you're just one click away (push down on the analog D-pad) from teleporting to the last altar visited. A feature I never use but that I accidently use so many times... Kind of annoying when I traveled quite far since the last altar, to be teleported back. A feature I think they should take away or just add ""yes / no"" if you want to teleport back to the last altar.

Other than that, pretty good and also maybe animals that can be tamed/ridden. Cant wait for full release.",1708425454,1708425454,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

few points I want to raise, in no particular order:

[b]Combat[/b]

During my adventures I've become to notice the bows are for pressing out of reach puzzle buttons in temples, not for combat. I carry hundreds of arrows but the damage is less than 1/10th of the swing of my axe. And dingy magic wands seem to be my bosskillers, as I can just dodge my way around any bigger enemy while whittling them down with my crummy magic wands. Hitting them with arrows is just no-go, and melee gets me in their damage range.

Now, admittedly so far (~20h in) I've encountered 2 enemies I'd consider a boss, everything else I have hacked down with melee.

My current build is leaning heavily towards healer (passive health regen is awesome) and tank (less incoming damage).

Also, it seems like 1 handed melee weapons are vastly superior to twohanders. Twohanders are unwieldy and slllllooooooowwww. With onehanders I can just hit 10 times before the twohander's animation has hit halfway point. The damage numbers don't seem to balance this, at all.

[b]Survival light[/b]

Foods and drinks are for buffs, not for staying alive. No hunger or fatigue in here. Some could see that as a negative, but I rather find it refreshing to not need to care about hunger meters.

Trees, mining hotspots, etc. Seem to grow back rather quickly.

[b]Puzzles[/b]

Temple puzzles are fairly straightforward. Platform your way through the temple, push buttons, avoid spiky traps, etc. I was fairly surprised that neither of the 2 temples I've done had any enemies inside, just ""platforming puzzles"". Maybe the enemies have hella strong vertigo so they don't like to live in tall towers.

[b]Death[/b]

So, eventually the adventurer will die. On such occasion you leave a marker (red glowing ""tombstone"") behind you, with some of your crafting materials you were carrying. Seemingly no equipment (atleast the ones you have equipped) are dropped. Just go back and collect your remains and carry on.

The tombstone will move to a bit safer location if you managed to die in eg. in the middle of a ""lava"" pool, or fell to the bottom of a near instakill shroud canyon. Also, dying again doesn't remove the previous tombstone, so that's nice.

[b]Equipment and durability[/b]

weapons have durability bars, and they wear down bit quicker than I'd like, but it hasn't been an issue so far. Fixing gear is automatic (just open workbench and it's done) and costs no resources. Nice.

Workbenches (or functionally equivalent anvils) can be found here and there on the go, so you don't even need to travel back to base to fix.

[b]World, Traversal, Bases and fast travel[/b][/b]

The world map seems HUGE. 20 hours in and it looks like I've at most explored 10-15% of it.

The land is mountainous, which naturally restricts your travels and make you take longer routes until you open fast traveling points. Fairly early on you get a glider, which functions more or less like the deku leaf in windwaker.

You can fastravel between bases and conquered temples (towers?) - which is handy. Bases offer repairs (when you've built a workbench there) and temples offer a jumping point to traveling further. On longer journeys you might want to bring a base starting kit (flame altar) and crafting table with you just to make a new fast travel point and repair station if needed. There doesn't seem to be any limits of how many ""bases"" you can make.

[b]Loot[/b]

There isn't *that* much stuff to get. Basic crafting materials, weapons, that kind of sort, but inventory is stack based. So: one flower takes the same amount of space than 50 chunks of stone. Which for a loot hoarder like myself makes the inventory management during adventures a nightmare. I might survive without the one flower, sure, but... aargh :D

Dropped items vanish from the word, unnescessary/thrash weapons and such you can break into upgrade materials (seemingly 1 type of item) which stack into single stack & in huge quantities.

Not really sure if loot is random per se. The first boss I killed dropped a purple 1h axe, which ~15 hours later is still my main weapon. No weapon since has even come close, which is fairly odd.

[b]Performance[/b]

For reference: I have rtx3090, 5800x3d, 32gb ram, 1440p120Hz gsync display, win10.

Basically could run the game fine on second highest settings, but the cooling gets lout. Very. Loud. Dropping few settings (with no real perceivable difference) it quiets down. Seemingly high textures and shadows are the most demanding settings.

Other than that, using eg. nvidia control panel to limit the game's fps seems to cause occasional stutters, which go away by eg. alt-tabbing. They will come back in time tho.

[b]Yay or nay?[/b]

Definitely Yay. Feels good so far, eagerly waiting for future updates and performance optimizations.",1708423773,1708423773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I like the building part. But the combat of the game is definitely lacking. It's not fun for me, and I wish there was an option to either go full on creative mode or have an option to unlock all recipes before starting the game. I want to engage with the building system. I do not want to engage with the combat system.

I'm just going to rattle off some gripes I have while playing as a mage:

- The range of the wands are pathetic. Staves are better but regardless...
- There's little visual and audio flair to the magic.
- There's not enough variety in the magic. You're casting a simple projectile every time, no matter what it is.
- All I have to do to avoid the vast majority of attacks is slowly back up, or jump on top of something.

It's just not fun or satisfying to play. I'd rather engage in the MUCH more robust building system.

However to be fair:

- I've been spoiled on games with great magic systems such as Dragon's Dogma, Skyrim, Dragon Age...but hell even the first Fable game in 2004 had better magic than this. 

- This is early access. I'm sure they'll add something that would improve the experience. 

- I haven't played the game very long either - but I've looked up end-game mage gameplay and it doesn't look like it improves much at all. 

Right now, it's disappointing. I'm forcing myself to play through the combat just to gain access to the building recipes. From what I read, It sounds like rangers have it even worse than mages so god help those players.

I've played games with weak combat systems before and still loved them (Stardew Valley, Minecraft..) 
With those games, combat is either very brief or largely non-essential. There's a different focus. However with Enshrouded, I am repeatedly goaded into combat to make progress, to gather essential materials to make this or that. *I don't want to* yet if I want to make progress *I have to.* Either let me chill in the building system or improve the combat.

TL;DR Plenty of people have made better combat systems. But I struggle to think of ones that have a building system as good as Enshrouded. I wish I didn't have to engage with the combat as much. However - I'm sure it will get better with time. Wait for updates if there are other *complete* games on your radar that you want to play.",1708407867,1708410404,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Big enough for me to stop playing after only 2.8 hours and wait for fixes. I was going to give a negative review, but the game has too much potential and is great when this issue isn't happening. The game randomly goes into some kind of 20-30fps mode for 10-30 seconds sometimes when you start moving. The steam overlay, Rivatuner, everything says I'm pulling 90-144 fps with good frame times at 1080p, but it feels like 20-30fps. Iv'e never seen anything like it. It's like the game's animations and camera get locked to 30 or something. I have a Ryzen 7 5800x3D, 32GB of 3200MHz DDR4 RAM, an RTX 4070 on the latest drivers and a 7,500MB/s M.2 SSD that Enshrouded is installed on. It isn't shader comp stutters as the game compiles them as you start and they are repeatable. I also waited for that process to finish before playing. I thought it might have been VRAM related, but the game surprisingly goes nowhere near my 12GB, so that's not it. Iv'e limited the game to 60fps in the Nvidia control panel, but that also did nothing. Very odd issue. Be ready to wait a long time for a fix if you buy Enshrouded. Now to the actual review:

When I first started playing, the game reminded me of Portal Knights. Sure enough, when I looked up who developed Enshrouded, surprise! It's the same developers. I RARELY buy early access games anymore after too many bad experiences, but this just looked too good, and for the most part, it's great other than the deal breaking performance issue mentioned above. Enshrouded feels like a grown up, more advanced, single open world Portal Knights and that's a good thing. You have a great and unique building system and tons of class playstyles. I went the wizard route. There are so many cool little details, like grass growing back when you pick something up off the ground, or the reverb in caves and inside buildings. The corrupted shroud zones look really cool, like you'd catch every disease known to man just by breathing in there. Sadly, since I only could manage playing for a few hours, I never got to destroy the source of one and see things regrow there.

I know people hate when anything is compared to Soulsborne games, but the combat in Enshrouded is basically that, mixed with Valheim's great ""You won't starve to death"" solution to hunger as it's survival elements. You get rested/food/comfort buffs to increase your health, damage and regen. I'm not the biggest fan of weapon/armor durability, but at least repairs are free and instant. It's also cool that inventory slots are your only limit. No weight management. The only real complaint about gameplay is the crazy cost of plant fiber roofs. Iv'e deforested everything around and it maybe gave me enough fiber for 25% of my roof. Not sure how I'm going to finish it. Maybe my base is just a convertible. :P",1708409182,1708409182,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Though I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a survival crafting game with heavy emphasis on group play and one of the best voxel based environment modification and building mechanics, there are a few things that need to be worked out.
Firstly, server settings. There are none. Don't expect to be able to customize yours and your groups experience with the game. Currently what you see when you load into the world is what you get.
Secondly, a lot of perks found in the talent trees don't seem to be working. An example of this is poison resistance, which if anything seems to -increase- the amount of damage taken rather than reduce it.
Third, progression is server based instead of personal. This can be a problem for a lot of people and it's nice to see the developers address this. My personal perspective is that people need to get over it. ""Progression"" seems to be the tutorial of the game. To be more precise, it would appear to me after 52 hours of playtime, unlocking all the crafting tables, hitting the current level cap, and exploring the majority of the map that the game as it stands at the time of this review is merely the larger tutorial section to the game, much like the first 4 to 8 hours of Cyberpunk 2077 were in reality the introductory sequence to what erupts into a much larger game.
Unfortunately, for the time being, there isn't much of a larger game to be found past this point in Enshrouded, which can be done in probably half the time I was able to accomplish it as an aggressive DPS build accompanied by a dedicated healer/caster partner.
All in all, if you're looking for a great fantasy survival crafting game with crisp graphics and a lot of growth ahead of it - Enshrouded is the title you're looking for. On the other hand, if you're looking for something that will entertain you and a group of friends for longer than a month, you may want to slap it onto your wishlist and wait for a couple of major content updates before giving Enshrouded ""the old college try"".",1708404157,1708404157,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's a lot to like about this game even though it's in early access but there are a lot irritations especially with getting around. The map is huge and there are no mounts and running is nice when you can but unfortunately it takes stamina and you'll be forever running out of puff so you'll have to walk everywhere. It's mountainous as well and objectives often seem to be somewhere behind a very large mountain range with no way over.

There's hardly a boss in sight. Only one genuine boss about half way through the game. Although the game isn't a particularly hard single player game but there are times when multiplayer coop would be helpful. However unless unless you have up to 16 friends handy who all want to play this game with you at exactly the same time that's not going to happen. All I want to do is summon a little help for that boss in the capital, but alas no! Lucky I was able to cheese it anyway!

I've only played for a little while, (8 hours as of the time of this review) but this game is a fantastic sandbox RPG. In particular, I want to emphasize how amazing the environment and building system is, especially regarding map size and optimization with large edits.


The entire map is made up of 2(+?) main voxel grids (terrain, structure, and possibly more?) with standard 3D objects placed on top for decorations. It circumvents the issue of Valheim's performance issues of tracking large amounts of player-made voxel edits by limiting your building area to a cube centered around a place-able furniture piece. All voxel edits done outside of your ""claimed"" areas are discarded and reset to the base world-state after some time passes (might be logging out and back in? I'm not 100% positive).

Aside from the really cool sandbox environment and building system, the rest of the game takes a page from other popular games, and kinda lumps unpolished mechanics together. The third-person action combat isn't turning any heads, nor is the kinda trite grapple + glider that's starting to become a staple of any open-world game. The crafting-progression is fine, RPG stat-progression is there, but again, doesn't innovate.

With all this said, I wholeheartedly recommend this game because, while the mechanics it slaps together may not all interface nicely and cleanly, nor do they innovate too much, but they *are* there, and they *do* work. Considering all of these atop the super cool environment and terrain system they've created, Enshrouded is fun!",1708401929,1708401929,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

[h3]Update after 100%-ing the EA achievements[/h3]
I would say all of the comments I made during the early review hold true now ~30 hours later. I don't see myself replaying the entire game much, but I do look forward to revisiting my solo save file as more and more of the game is released. I may someday do a private server with friends, but maybe only after full release. I did enjoy the progression offered in game. All bosses could be cheesed, but whatever, that's the fun of a sandbox type game. I'll keep the title of this the same, if you like this type of game, you'll like this one too. I certainly got a lot of bang for my buck from it.

[h3]Overview/Summary[/h3]
Reviewing this very [u]early access[/u], and with not many hours into it yet, but I would say I am on the [b]positive side of neutral[/b] on Enshrouded so far. I can see it getting better with time or with a dedicated group of friends, but I worry this will only hold my attention for so long. To me the game feels most like V Rising meets Valheim (and a little bit of ArcheAge...?), which are all games I enjoyed and got my money out of. I haven't had many of the bugs reported by other players, but I definitely have noticed the optimization problems, which I'm sure the devs will clear up with time (it's ea for a reason). I will try my hardest not to get distracted by some other game before finishing it, but no guarantees.

Below are some more specific things I do/don't like with the game so far.
[hr][/hr]

[h3]Pros:[/h3] 
- I really like the building system. It's kind of basic, but in a good way. I like that the pieces will try to blend together, especially if they are the same material.
- I like that there are no base defense requirements. Sometimes I just want to build my mansion in the woods and forget about enemies for a bit.
- I like the weapon upgrading system. Sometimes you find a wand or sword that you like and you can just max it out and make it last for the whole zone. You'll eventually find something far superior, but you can just repeat. Salvaging the upgraded weapons will recoop some of the coins, but the coins are so readily available, it doesn't really matter.
- The tech tree feels good. A lot of different ways to play the game. I'll see something in one branch and something in another and realize that I can blend the two. I assume the tech tree gets even more fun when you can try out synergistic builds in multiplayer.
- Waypoints/teleporting with limited restrictions was a good decision. I wish there were a few more towers or maybe if the flame temples or the places you rescue the NPCs could also be used to teleport to. I don't need every respawn shrine to be a port, but a few more to break up the map without having to build a base in the area would be nice.
- The enemy models look nice and are kind of unique. They get a little repetitive after you've seen them a few times, but that happens in all games.
- Very much in line with V Rising or games like that, I like the way the resources can be queued up and crafted while I'm out doing whatever in the game. I can load up the sawmill and come back to enough boards to decorate my home with furniture.

[h3]Neutrals:[/h3]
- The lore is pretty cool when you pay attention to it. I often didn't read the lore and listen to the NPCs. Usually, I am trying to dodge monsters or clear an area and I collect the lore books/scrolls as I run by them. I did go back to read a few of them to try to fill me in on why I am doing any of it and it seems like they thought the lore out, but then again, can easily skip it all.
- I don't think replayability will be super high for me, except to revisit it with friends after major updates. I'm guessing I will have my solo play-through, do everything once and call it quits. Nothing wrong with that, but this won't be a forever game for me and that's fine.
- Inventory management could be better, but it's pretty on par with Valheim/V Rising. I'm sure the modding community will come up with some solutions just like in those games.
- Not being able to clear up the enshrouded areas is a bit annoying. For example, I cleared out the roots and all the enemies near the salt mines, only to realize I will have play time management game to mine out all the salt. Clearing out roots should clear more of an area of shroud. I'm glad the wells work that way at least. Maybe more a me problem, but areas with no roots should be able to be remediated or something. I hate that near the starting base zone (I left my base there), there's a few enshrouded areas that are in or bordering my base. Enemies no longer spawn there, but it's annoying to see in the distance. I haven't tried digging it out yet, maybe that would fix it.
- The main quests are good, because they keep you moving forward and let you unlock new things/areas/etc. The side quests are rarely worth doing though. As a completionist, I can't leave them unchecked (which often leads to me never finishing games, looking at you Assassin's Creed Origins/Odyssey/Valhalla), but big whoop if I get some crappy sword or whatever.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]
- Combat is pretty weak. Spamming attack with a sword can cc a whole swarm of adds. I'll usually collect them up around the shroud root and then go ham on them. Chop down the root and move on.
- Every boss I've fought so far can be cheesed. I haven't fought the wyvern thing yet, but the matrons, felguard guys, and the varkah (spelling?) boss were all readily cheesed and didn't pose much of a threat, even though I was only until very recently wearing rags. 
- Why can't armor be salvaged/upgarded like weapons?
- Falling into the shroud soup (don't know how else to describe it) and dying like instantly is soooooooo annoying. The number of times I've crested a hill only to fall into the shroud soup and eats away at my soul. Or if you make a double jump and then accidentally open the glider only to fly just too far and then do an automatic roll straight into it. I loooove having to respawn, go back to wherever the game decided to put my death marker to collect up my stuff is a blast.",1706505098,1708400360,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

*breaks through the nearest wall* HEY KIDDO, YOU LIKE VALHEIM! well do I have the deal for you? yes, yes I do! presenting Enshrounded, we took Valheim and merged it with the DNA of a flying squirrel, then we took away all of the f$#%ing water! Enjoy exploring a world that you'll have little to no tangible effect on! I hope you enjoy magic because nothing else is gonna be effective ever! But fret not civilian for you might see the building in this game and get excited about the possibility until you realize that it allows for all the creativity of a box placed next to another box with questionably working voxel mechanics! Now go out there, explore, conquest, gather, and most of all don't leave any evidence you were even ever there.

""I wanted to love this game.""
That's the quote I, and if you've read a bunch of reviews of this game you, have been hearing nonstop. But why you might be asking if you haven't played this game, well this game has the ground works of an amazing game unfortunately it fumbles so much.

Section One: The Combat

The combat, we all have to interact with it and that means it's extra important. A lot of really good games mechanics go overlooked but you can't overlook combat in a combat centered game. Combat boils down to a few things the Feel, the Fun, the Fairness, and the Fwhat you're hitting (the 'F' is silent). So let's start with The Feel, this game CAN feel like warm butter being spread on a beautifully crisp piece of toast that for some unknown reason is the best meal you've ever eaten, unfortunately at other times it feels like swimming in a pool of molasses while in deep combat with your arch nemesis who is, seemingly, unaffected by this hell you've been placed in and promptly shoves a sword right up your ass. To explain further, the glider in this game when pared with the grappling hook can, at times, feels so fluid it might as well be the air itself you are move along, in a finely crafted environment where you shoot down you're foes. At other times you're in a very flat area and a guy with a sword or two axes is running as you and since, as mentioned prior, the only decent option is magic you can't stab this neerdowell you must awkwardly back up and shoot him with your wand while doing the occasionally little hop, maybe even pared with a double jump and panic glide, until finally your foe is vanquished and you've succeeded at making a fool out of yourself. This is because all weapons effect your movement in some very annoying way. First melee weapons, they can range anywhere from throwing you three screens over straight towards and enemy and straight up their arse where you can promptly diagnose them with type one you up their ass, to nailing your own feet to the ground after striking with a large two handed mace. Next on the chopping block, bows, these amazing bits of combative technology of sometimes taking energy to use and other times not, slow you down to a little pitter patter while you aim where you'll be quickly and efficiently sliced to bits. Last but most certainly not least we have, magic which consists of two option, of which you'll be using both, first we have wands which shoot a ""medium"" range projectile and while you fire you get the same amazing pitter patter that takes years after firing to get out of so instead to avoid getting hit you do a weird little goblin hop looking like a crack head who'll do whatever it takes to get another hit. Then we have staffs, these are just bows but in a new coat of paint, given this is a very nifty coat of pain but nonetheless their basically the same thing but now you have mana and you can make infinite spells. But, while you're the slowest living being on the planet the same would not dare be said about the enemies in this game who have a knack for being the fastest beings alive. You have axe wielding crazy people running at you who can do a triple strike combo guaranteed to make you go ""I thought I press the dodge/dash button but I guess I was a little late."" Then you have people with bows and bombs, they do what you'd probably expect and shot and bomb you with their chosen bow and bomb type that range from a shot a every thirty minutes to every other second. Next up wolves, they're wolves you already know everything about them. Onto the plants, we have the pea shooter from plants verse zombies and a big mushroom not from plants verse zombies. This amazing combination of enemies gets you into wacky situations such as, ""oh no there's two guys with axes and I'm a snail."" all the way to, ""oh wow I'm standing on a elevated surface I'll live forever!"" Enjoy this and more in Enshrouded: Combat

Section Two: the grind

The grind in this game is kinda like a forest fire, you start out and you get some sparks and you're like ""alright I'll get a health fire going."" then it spreads and you're like ""ooo already that's enough no more of this or it'd be to much but I'm enjoying the heat."" then a few hours later you're in a prison for burning down half the amazon. But let's really put that into perspective, at the start of the game there is barely an ounce of grind you're just doing stuff having an alright time figuring it out maybe building a bit which takes more resources then you'd like but doesn't it always. Then, you've gotten around to collecting all of the people you're supposed to find and you're deciding on a class to play and you realize that things costs are starting to go up, but it's just a little it won't matter until you're spending five hours gathering copper, tin, wood, dirt, and everything else under the sun, including venturing to a salt mine and riding the world of every animal ever, so you can make some armor but you can't just make it, no that'd be to easy you have to wait another five hours while all of your various machines process your materials. This sucks, thought I'd say that in-case you missed it, and it isn't an issue I have anywhere else even with games that have you smelting down resources none of them are as bad as this game. also, just a little side note, enemies when slain don't drop their loot for you to just pick up, no that'd that be to easy you have to open a little menu and pick it all up which is so annoying and most of the time the loot isn't even worth it. Also, again, killing higher level enemies doesn't drop more or better loot so it doesn't give you a reason to do the harder fight when the easier one gives you the same stuff faster.

section three: I ran out of room

this review was cut short cause I typed to damn much and ran our of space so I'll sum up the rest.

the world resets everything making it feel like you don't have an effect on anything, this makes some sense as you are in a finite world so they have to do that but resets chest and all loot makes it feel a lot weirder and meaningless.

The farming it weird and it really doesn't need that middle stage of planter boxes.

the building leaves a lot to be desired even though at first glance it seems great, when compared to something like Valheim it's embarrassing with it's lack of slanted boxes and opportunities to be creative. they have one idea of what you can build and that's what you're gonna build which really sucks cause I love architecture and would love to builds so much more.",1708386568,1708387406,False,1,0,0.50127875804901123,0,True,False,True

The combat is absolutely terrible: you get locked into animations for too long, dodging is super clunky and unresponsive, there are no active skills to use and all you do is button mash with one of two weapons (extremely boring). 

There is almost no story, no cutscenes, no point to advancing anything other than getting the workstations for your 5 npcs so you can make things for your base. Very underwhelming.

On top of this, the slopes in this game are coated with butter and you will slide down mountains non stop; this has the added disadvantage of there being red lava stuff that instantly kills you if you touch it all around the map, which is completely stupid. The game is very frustrating and boring to play in its current iteration.

I'd love an armorer or somebody to be able to enhance the weapons we get/make so we could use them longer like upping the levels or stats.

Certain things need improvement, such as the occasional jankiness of the movement system like when you just slide down a big slope you spent 5 minutes trying to climb. A lot of missing features are voted on by the community and will likely be developed in the future, such as a weather system, non-combat skill progression, more water (there's no rivers, lakes or waterfalls wtf?), base raids, and livestock.

But at 37 and having watched several generations of developers rise and fall at this point I can say I appreciate the fact the entire Enshrouded world is hand tailored with purpose. It proves to me that procedural generated worlds just end up working against improving a games quality.

I equally enjoy the base building and exploring aspects of Enshrouded so far. I play solo atm due to the fact I have a newborn at home and need to get up and down frequently but look forward to when I can enjoy this game with others; watching videos of the co-op game play looks awesome.

The only thing I can say right now that I wish they would implement sooner rather than later in their early access state is Raids. Most colony builders, survival games, ect. that I've played have this mechanic and it is noticeably absent here. Being able to equip your NPCs, man some arrow turrets, build some auto magic turrets ect to go along with the defensible walls would be great.

Support this game and developer; as I've been playing I can notice the planning and care that goes not only into the core design but the way they are developing the play area.

While I was in the middle of playing, I discovered a new area and my game immediately stopped responding. I attempted to wait for it to respond but after 15 minutes it did not.

Still, its resemblance to Breath of the Wild with multiplayer doesn't quite elevate it beyond being a ""poor man's"" version. One of the hallmarks of Early Access titles is the promise of future improvement, but while some come with defined visions, Enshrouded seems content to emulate Ark.  The emphasis on community input also doesn't inspire confidence in the design and makes it look a bit rudderless.

The most obvious problem is the survival crafting leaves much to be desired.  The standard hotbar feels clunky and counterintuitive for a game aspiring as an action title, yet the cumbersome interface and tedious crafting mechanics do not immerse or thrill.  The building is a highlight, It is relatively easy to construct and you can make quite detailed structures.  It suffers from its own set of limitations though, in a post-Valheim world the lack of material returns upon deconstruction feels stingy and discourages experimentation, and I can't imagine why you would want to make anything interesting in this world.  This is a failure of a lot of games: you can make a base, but without a reason to *do* so it doesn't matter how detailed they can get.  Not to mention the inventory is tiny and quickly fills up with objects of unclear usefulness.  It should come as no surprise that the absence of a clear end goal or achievable narrative leaves little purpose beyond ""play more.""  Oh, may I?  Perhaps I can get more rocks or hit more enemies with a stick.  It's not engrossing, it's lacking a lot of features, the interface is cumbersome and the only real advantage it seems to have is multiplayer.  You could get a group of friends together and ... be here.  Hanging out is a common friendly thing to do, I just dislike that Enshrouded wants you to do it here without showing up with a reason why.

I never got the feeling from it that it seems to want to have: a party of friends embark on a journey. Valheim got it right, Enshrouded is just playing at it.  Ultimately, it seems content with mediocrity, relying on superficial elements like base-building aesthetics and friends to make up for its otherwise milk-toast presentation.  Future updates could inject the game with personality and purpose.  As of now, Enshrouded may hold fleeting appeal as a passing trend, but its future remains uncertain.

I've typed this review several times, but I think I'll keep the details out for now. Right now, I Do Not Recommend because the game is in Early Access and as EA participants it is unclear to me how to provide experiential feedback about this game without composing a Steam Review. 

After playing roughly 30 hours in the game, I've picked a major problem I could summarize as much as possible.
I feel bad using the skill tree. I don't know if any of the existing suggestions on how to fix the skill tree will help. I didn't want to use it when I started, I've looked at builds, and I still don't want to. I wanted to share my feelings and experience about this that led to the real problem. My play experience has been ok with glimmers of great but my experience as a EA participant is bad. 

The developer's ""Why EA?"" reads ""We are committed to listening to you, the community."" but the tools I was able to find did not let me use my voice to tell my story. I have spent time trying to leave feedback on a title that claimed you can leave feedback ""in game"" - but that as of now opens up my web browser to upvote or comment on an existing post, because one surely represents me. There are excited fans throwing suggestions and community management is hard, hard work. But none feel like they are experiential of how I felt when I stared at that skill wheel and said ok... magic, melee and... green?
 
If I participate in an EA title, I want to leave feedback. This game has many problem areas. It's not just the skill tree. I was enjoying this game as a player. Despite everything, I was hooked. I see glimpses of a game that I am excited about. But after trying to provide feedback and then feeling like a upvote number on something I don't agree with, I might uninstall instead.",1708375875,1708375875,False,1,0,0.477466493844985962,0,True,False,True

It's not super intuitive, and is lacking variety, but it does allow you to almost custom make shapes (1m single block) It is still early access so I'm sure there are plans for more to be added.
The combat is ok, mostly just bashing the mouse until the enemy or you is dead. 
The map is freaking huge! I've probably only explored about 1/4 of it so far. Lost of places to go and things to see.
I have had to google some recipes as it's not explained how you make certain items, I feel adding something to aid this would be good.
Lost of quests, nothing too fancy, usual sort of thing for the type of game.

Overall I really like the concept of the game and it runs and plays well. I'd recommend getting it if you like base building rpg's. Theres not much of a survival aspect (dont need to consume food nor water to stay alive) but overall its worth the current price in it's current state imo.

- Too many crashes (honey / wax issue still not fixed even though community found about it and it impacts nearly everyone)
- When game crashes, some things are lost because not persisted, I'm not talking about seconds but minutes and sometimes a lot. Dev should consider adding some save triggers like when you drop a legendary, because it happens far too often that the game crashes after, you just loose it, so to avoid that from happening you leave the server to force it make a save and you start again.
- Gameplay needs some improvements
- Keyboard interaction is not fluid enough, switching context like moving / checking inventory / chest, makes the keypresses to reset and we cannot chain actions quickly, this is annoying.
- Switching weapons is very slow
- Stats info are missing in Character / All attributes panel, and some maths are not computed well (i.e. thick skin skill supposed to give me 3 constitution but gives me only 2).

Huge, beautiful, hand buiild map with lots of places and (small) stories and secrets to discover. World, traversal and puzzles remind of Breath of the Wild. 

Building reminds of Minecraft with a lot smaller blocks (Voxels). You can terraform the world, but changes are only saved in (quite large) ""home zones"" you can place some of freely. Everything else gets reset after exiting the game.

You gain experience through verious tasks, level up and can unlock a nicely big skill tree. Lots of paths to choose from or to combine. Fighting makes fun. Not too hard, not too easy for me.

I have to take a break from this game. The fog/bloom effects are cooking my eyeballs and it's becoming an actual strain to play. I wear glasses, the blue light blocker type because I use a computer all day. And these glasses are not really tempering the fog/bloom light effects of this game. This game Really Needs a Gamma Slider/Adjuster. Please. A game that's affecting me adversely is a game that I recommend against playing. Sorry. !!



(Previous Review: 

 am playing solo, my friends would just ruin things. This is NOT an survival game. I made that mistake. But it's OK. I am enjoying this game tremendously. Enshrouded is an action RPG with many, fun survival elements. It feels a bit gated at times but even that's OK, this is Early Access still. If Zelda and Valheim had a baby... ummm Zeldheim? Valda?

The music and appearance are fantastic. Great audio quality. I do wish that the whispered voices were a little less frequent. I am gonna develop some neurotic disorder behavior. I think the fog and bloom effects are gonna burn my retinas out way before then.

I would like to warn those photo sensitive gamers that it will be necessary to pause the game pretty frequently because the shroud fog effects and the lighting bloom effects are grossly overdone. And There Is No Adjustment currently. Sadly. So be prepared. For many folks, this is a game changer. For some of us, we suffer thru and decide suddenly when we have had enough.

Lots to explore, mountains, peaks, valleys, caves. Chumps to rescue to help improve your gear/buildings. Not a whole lot of serious combat challenges. Once you get the block timed right, you can stomp all the things.

At this time, I recommend the game and I am having lotsa fun. I will eventually grab my friends to play this when I have peaked into enough corners and hidey holes. Gaming is ofc better with friends, as long as they don't want to go fast and ruin the lore part. :D )",1706492209,1708365764,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The gameplay of Enshrouded will be familiar to anyone who's played a survival game. You collect basic resources to build a base and equipment, which allows to go to tougher areas to repeat the process. In enshrouded, as in Valheim, a boss provides a checkpoint before reaching the next area. Again as in Valheim, the food you eat will affect both the health and stamina of your character, but unlike Valheim, as does your level. By leveling up, your character can unlock perks, which are roughly divided into playstyles. The game differentiates itself with the addition of the shroud, regions of the game with low visibility, tougher enemies, and a timer for how long you can remain within. As important items are usually located within, they present a welcome challenge to what is otherwise a fairly standard example of the genre.

The world of Enshrouded is quite nice looking. The game leans more to the realism side of cartoonish, but with a marked fantasy twist. Each biome has a tower, with puzzles to solve as you climb. When you reach the top, you reveal points of interest, and a fast travel point. These are also some of the best views you can find in the game. Overall, no complaints. In regards to bugs, there are a few, (primarily involving characters stuck in terrain), but nothing too major. 

Overall, I'd recommend it. It has a few unusual challenges that work well with the genre, while keeping what makes survival games so interesting.",1708365186,1708365186,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I was looking for ""another Vallheim"", but got bored with it multiple times trying to push forward that maybe later it get better. 

Exploring is quite fun for a moment, but then you are stopped how far you can get ... brutally.
You enter shroud as any other .. and suddenly you instantly die - because, you know, this is higher level shroud. So you run again the way from last save spot, to get your stuff and try to walk around it or look other places how you can level up (stuff - ""spoiler free"") to progress further. And then another level .. and another.

Main part of exploring is slowly carving steps in mountains using mining pick and wall jumping (and sliding down) untill you get where you need to. Double jump helps a lot .. but that's not kind of exploring I would enjoy.

Building feels shallow? Think even minecraft has better, more intuitive base building. You can build cool stuff.. but it's very painful expirience and really testing patience.  System of roof tiles is just a crime.

Crafting .. artificialy limited by progressing story.
By the time I discover new things to do I have just stacks of materials to use. I craft everything I can and again look for ""safe passage"" to next story point.

It's not a survival game, for people who want to slowly build base, and develop character. 
It's multiplayer game first, and systems are though to not go into the way of the group that want to just run around map exploring not spending their time gathering, crafting and maintaining base.",1708364763,1708364763,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However: combat is good, feels super responsive, does not use iframing which is a massive plus in my books, mobility gets better and better as you play and unlock.

The building is absolute S tier, but there needs to be more purpose to build bases.

Playing longer than 5 minutes, the shaders finish compiling, as can be seen on the Esc pause menu, so you can ignore most of the negative reviews.  The lighting looks nice and it is fun to explore with a torch unlike other games, and exiting a dark building into daylight is briefly blinding.  Just lovely to be in the world.  Building system is robust, allowing typical tile (4m), half (2m) and granular 1m voxel building with many texture types, on top of terrain terraforming.  You can completely customize every aspect of any building piece, or make your own using the 1x1 blocks.  Crafting is smooth, and has a good pin recipe system for gathering resources, it also follows a typical tier style, being: handmade, bench/station required, and then specialized craftsmen, who also need in-world stations / tools.  Combat feels good, let's be realistic here, this isn't FromSoftware, nor does it need to be.  You can still die easily if surrounded.  This is one of those games that rewards exploration as well, not just the fastest trip from point A to point B.

Ultimately, I requested a refund.

Everything was going well, but the deciding factor for me is the potential loss of items upon death, and having to backtrack to collect said items. I expect that with FromSoftware games, but with souls-games, I know what I'm getting myself into and set aside time to play it.

I'm in my 40s with 1/8 of the time to play games as much as I used to, so I was hoping this would be more of a pick-up-and-play and if I died, I could go in a different direction and try again without a handicap, but that's not how Enshrouded is currently setup and I can't sink the time investment required to fully appreciate the nuances.

I'm okay with time limits in the fog as the areas (at least in the beginning of the game) aren't That vast, so I was able to run out and let my character idle for a couple of minutes when I needed to.

Overall, would recommend if you have the time to divulge into its mechanics... But if you can only play for 20mins at a time here and there because of real life (family, job, whatever it may be), this may not be what you're ultimately looking for.

In truth, many of these things may change but until that is the case, I won't be playing much and don't really recommend it.  Keep a look out on it and watch for updates but wait for the devs to improve things. 

Things I do like: 
-The building is fun and although it's a little different interface-wise with building than I'm used to, it is a pretty robust feature in the game.  Building is probably my favorite thing in survival/craft/building games.  
-The combat is interesting though I haven't taken on any truly difficult battles.  It works relatively well so far.  
-The world is nice, though not soulmask level of beauty, it's decent for a voxel game.  

What I don't like, and what I think will change if there are updates to these things:  
- Character models are horribly squatty looking and everyone looks like a halfling or dwarf.  It's like a style that tries to be realistic somewhat but with the proportions of what should be in a cartoony game.  Either go with cartoony characters or realistic, one or the other.  As it is they look like semi-reallistic but squatty disproportionate characters.  (I doubt this will change but I'll just leave that there) 

- bloom or whatever it is that makes the whole world look faded and blurry on the verge of hurting the eyes.  This one is really the one thing that probably keeps me from playing longer sessions because it's so bad it's painful.  My eyes are constantly trying to focus becuase everything is covered with a horrible mist/bloom in the sunny areas. Just badly done lighting that makes it difficult to play.  I'm hoping they either change this or add an option to turn it off/down.  

Potentially a decent game, but for now I'm just gonna wait.

The game has a story, but so far, it doesn't feel like the main driver of the game. 

A lot of the negative reviews focus on the fact that quest progression is server bound and not player bound. I've been playing coop and have not had any issues with this. A lot early access games feel like they should have never been released because they are unfinished and buggy. So for this game doesn't have that problem. Outside of a couple of minor visual bugs, I have not had any issues.

This game needs more bosses. Roaming world bosses, static dungeon bosses etc.. It needs more monster variation too. Additionally, the pacing could use some work. You spend too much time running around the map from location to location.

This is not a ""definitive"" Negative review, however, as these things might get patched. On to the review though:

While, yes, the building is phenomenal and a definite step up with the creative freedom it brings it is the danger enemies pose which sours the entire package. Whether gathering materials, food or going for quests, you are bound to fight. The trouble here, though, isn't the ineffectiveness of the playstyles (Magic, Melee, Ranged) but rather the enemies themselves. I play solo, so the following issues aren't derived from a poor connection or such issues:

- Wildly inaccurate tells for hits: Enemies' attacks can be learned and dodged, but there are times where their reach is clearly excessive or the hit-detection is not comparable to the visible model. A good example are boars, who have on one hand a predictible charge and a short-range double-swipe with their tusks...which does not deal damage after a wind-up but immediately on Frame 1 of the animation. Going into melee here guarantees almost a hit unless you count the time between their actions as you cannot visibly gauge when the first of the two hits strikes, resulting in a very cheap hit.

Another example is, in general, the humanoid enemies and how the parry-window isn't clearly defined. There are bear-like humanoids who can only be parried at the start of their attack's wind-up, while the actual attack itself is already in an unparriable state. Shroud enemies and Scavengers' parries tend also to be misaligned from their models, but here I have trouble getting consistent results as well.

- Being hit results in a light stun: One of the most frustrating things is that being hit does not mean ""being hit once"" but ""subjected to the rest of the attack sequence of the enemy"". The on-hit ston of any attack prevents rolling and blocking/parrying, ensuring one mistake is paid dearly for. Some enemies have such multi-combo attacks that you can lose over half your available health after being hit once...which is not ideal.

- The damage is at times excessive: Tying into the above, the damage dealt from those multi-attacks is brutal. In this game, healing is not as feasible outside of spells and potions, both of which require resource-gathering to provide sufficient numbers. The amount of healing provided is great, yet with being hit once consuming already the first type of potion's entire healing capability you go through these quite fast. Farming in this game takes time and the quantity of resources needed for the average person to deal with the damage will be considerate...and that keeps one stuck in the gathering stage rather than exploring the dangerous places for loot and progression.

- Difficulty ramping, armor and content gating: Workstations are unlocked by exploring and finding key components to make them. These are often in the next highest level region than the previous, as expected. The same goes for the resources...and that is where most of the previous issues combine into a major problem: The armour you can craft is limited by the stations you have and the areas where you find the next components has enemies appropriate for that station's provided benefits. Or, in other words, you have to get the means to make better armor in regions where you already need them to survive easier. In solo I am almost required to cheese enemies to not get hit as I intended to play a ranger, but this just feels cheap and not rewarding. Going into melee, however, results in dealing with the jank I spoke of before and that cost me plenty of deaths. Since a lot of progress is done in ruins and places with little elevation I regretted my choice to play a ranger rather quickly as their armor is, as expected, in an even worse position than the tank's own.


I will admit here that I am playing solo, that this is meant to be played with several people and such, yet I don't have the time to go online that often (or more specifically: In a consistent pattern). That means some of my criticisms are part of the way I play, but this doesn't cause them to no longer be an issue: Whomever is going to play a Fighter, on- or offline, will deal with the janky melee combat anyways. The places you have to go to remain as dangerous and while many hands gather more you are bound to consume a lot more too.

As others have said, the building and the rest of the game, especially the scope, are still impressive and will keep me personally interested for a good while. There is 100% a great time here, just at this time there are bugs and a lot of jank you need to accept for the time being. IF you read this far and are weighing your options, let me say this: I reckon these bugs and issues will get addressed in the future, so this negative review is just as temporary (hopefully). I will update this review once these problems have been dealt with, though even now one thing I need to say clearly:

If the above issues are nothing you are concerned with, I do recommend the game whole-heartedly. I can't speak for issues with server connections, lag etc. but if the stated issues are sometihng you are willing to ignore, accept or work around: Go give it a shot!",1708352724,1708352724,False,70,5,0.663309276103973389,7,True,False,True

The game is very polished for an early access game with tons of content and places to explore, the game scales well with CooP and the devs say they are working on sorting quest line out for each player so if your offline and your friend completes a quest you can still do it on the same server.

I found a slight bug that once I figured out was soon easy to avoid and fix. This bug is where you build your first base and happens if you chop down a tree with a bee's nest on it in your base area as the area claim will prevent the tree growing back but the honey and wax from the bee's nest will still spawn and pile up causing issues. If you have this bug then look for honey and wax on the floor in your claim area and pick them up and move the base flame to allow the tree to grow back or just keep checking that area each log in and picking up the wax and honey.

Also the game don't like you planting 100's of plants around you base as that to can cause stability issues I kept them below 150ish and not had issues since.

The game is defiantly worth £24.99 and will easily give you 40 - 50 hours if you rush it but take your time and explore all the map and invest in building etc you should get 100 or so hours.

And I do believe this number is gonna keep growing : ) OK so back to the game itself, the atmosphere it created with good music and scenes are epic. The surrounding is immersive and full of imagination. And players are free to do various things from building to killing monsters. However, one tiny flaw of this game is that the beginner’s guide sucks : ( or should I say no proper guide at all lol. It was really painful at the very beginning since I had no clue of what to do and the guide is not helpful at all. However, once suffered and survived the first two or three hours, it took a bright turn and things become so much more clear. Explore the map and encounter various interesting events, creatures, etc. Exploring can be so much fun since u dunno what u gonna see next.

I love that the roots are individual, but for something that usually takes 3-4 min to do, it makes little sense why the spires and other progression that takes much longer and have many more steps is shared even when on the other side of the map. I understand why some may enjoy this as it makes the game more immersive in a way, but for my team it caused many fights over objectives, gear, and of course leveling, basically forcing us to be attached at the hip most of the game (so far) as there was little opportunity to separate without ruining the game for each other. 

If loot being shared is truly necessary, id love to see a roll system before looting as a party to prevent fights as I mentioned before. for a game that seems heavily inspired by the DnD type tropes and atmospheres I feel like it can really benefit from that. 

other than that, this game is truly amazing and has so much potential and I cant wait to see what they do with it in the future.

Combat was really simple buttonmashing, enemies all felt the same and simple.

Exploration was cool! But then you’d run into the same enemies everywhere that have single-braincell AI so you would turn off your brain to do head-empty to head-empty combat.

I was excited for building but the build system snapping was miserable and trying to do anything with furniture was tedious because of how you needed to craft it at workbenches and put it in your hotbar and so on.

The game also is poorly optimized for graphics that I feel don’t justify how demanding it is.

For me, I compare to Valheim which I know has simple combat mechanics but somehow Valheim just felt better? Building in that game also felt better too! I think that this game tried to take a lot of good mechanics from various games, but the execution just fell flat and you ought to play those instead, even if this were on sale.

The world is HUGE and this is nuts considering the devs say that is only part of what they want to do. Building your bases is super fun and the diversity in building materials and decorations means you can almost certainly customize any and every base. There are a good amount of varying enemies, but I certainly wish there were more variety in bosses. Certain items need their stack sizes adjusted cause that is kinda annoying. Quests exist and they are certainly fine. Their main point is to either make you explore or further an npc's crafting abilities.

- The world is divided into level-specific regions; you'll know when you went too far for your level.
- Gameplay is what I'd call 'safe' - No raids or threats will find your base; build freely.
- The gameplay loop is satisfying, but needs more content (more quests, etc).
- The loot system is also fairly linked to the regional level system, and that both sucks, and can be exploited.
- The meat of the game is done, but not the brain - go out and do quests, get loot and resources, but WHY? What's the end goal? Perhaps it'll be added later.
- The achievements need some fleshing out - they feel like very generic things that you'll probably do anyway.

- The thing I like the least about this game is the building system. It just feels bizarre to place a tiny block, or many tiny blocks, to build your house or roads.

I was really surprised by the amount of work put into the lore of the game, connecting quests with side quests in such a fun way. You don't get bored exploring, as you might run into one of the hundreds of letters or books, which give you another reason to keep going.
Base building has great mechanics, allowing you to make basements, or underground bases. Yes, no gravity physics on the blocks, but it doesn't even matter.

The Good: Sound design and effects enhance game play and situations well, Gliders, visual style is cool in a miyazaki-does-soulslike kinda way, and the skill tree seems inspired with good suggested paths that leave a lot of room for meaningful customization. The game has that BotW quality where around every corner there's an interesting looking thing to check out. Did I mention the gliders?

The Bad: They story feels about as developed and important to the game as the single player campaign in a Street Fighter title. The skill tree has a lot of hills and valleys; beast summoning and necromancy perks that base off procs or nearby wildlife that can't be kept up reliably without either, and QoL perks like double jump or extra damage for hitting weak points that are so must-have I resent having to spend points on them. The crafting and building feels like board game night at your friends house, complicated for being complicated's sake. The combat gets old FAST, outside of changing your weapon type there's not much variation in combat and only so many enemy types. The interesting thing around every corner quality even wares thin when more often than not the interesting thing pans out to be another empty spot or just more copy pasted dudes.

The Ugly: Bugs, still so many bugs. I know it's ""early release"" but what non-AAA game isn't these days? I paid $30 for a broken game. Shroud timers not going away when you leave shroud. Waypoint, quest and map markers swapping around. Level of detail rubber banding all over the place. NPCs clipping through the floor. And this isn't a bug but you're going to wall off huge swaths of the map just use a literal wall or impassable fog, not a bright red laser wall that looks like it came from Tron.

Other games in the genre have instantly captured my interest. I put hundreds of hours into Valheim because the world felt worth exploring, and worth living in for a while. Proc-gen worlds like Valheim's can sometimes feel a bit wild, unbalanced, or unfair, and maybe that's part of what makes them exciting.

And that's exactly what Enshrouded lacks for me. I don't care about this world. It feels a bit dreary, and doesn't inspire a sense of adventure, despite clearly being designed to do so. I can't put my finger on exactly why that is. I end up asking myself ""why bother surviving here?""

Part of it might be how game-y it is. I can't explore anywhere I want in the world, instead having to follow a predefined series of progression steps to unlock areas of the map. It's a little like playing in the game world of a dead MMO. The grind feels sterile because the world is too carefully balanced for said progression. You can't easily wander into an area you're not ready for and get one-shot. Instead, it's more like you're taking a guided tour.

Anyway, I eagerly await the clown awards, and maybe I'll change my review if I end up playing more of this game in a month or two and find I'm enjoying it after all.

EDIT: Still not that into it after 26 hours. It definitely has some nice parts, but it still kinda feels like playing a dead MMO. Maybe it's not helping that the world is so static. The whole thing resets (outside the bounds of your build areas) every time you reload the game. It's just so... transient. Like playing a game at a friend's house, where you know none of your progress will really matter and you're just passing time with something that doesn't belong to you.",1707661705,1708315364,False,5,0,0.520084738731384277,0,True,False,True

Also the shroud makes the game annoying as it's not truly open world like a game like Skyrim as the shroud makes you rush through areas to find what you need and get out, there are few natural fast travel locations in the game, and it is at times difficult to figure out where the boss/monster is that you need to kill to remove the shroud in certain areas. I feel the game would have been much better if there were more natural in game fast travel locations (instead of the player having to place multiple bases and use them as fast travel points), no weapon durability (a pointless addition to the game that forces you to have to travel to your base to restore durability, terrain that insta kills you by acting like a super toxic shroud (this has literally no purpose and caused me to spend a couple minutes trying to retrieve the items that fell when I died on it, which is hard to do when every time I retrieve my items on that terrain I instantly die), and most importantly no shroud as it ruins the fun of being able to explore new areas when there is a huge fog that kills you if you stay too long. What makes open world games fun is that you can explore far and wide without a care in the world. Instead of having the shroud they could simply add higher level enemies in areas they don't want the player to explore early so at the very least they can still go there if they want to explore and get new weapons and quests.

For merely $30, I got more than my money's worth in a fun, addicting, wonderful open world game that has put current Triple A to shame! The gliding is sublime, the world is massive and full of POIs that keep me adventuring, and the ability to lightly multiclass gave me the opportunity to fight the Shroud off in my own way!

With that out of the way, I would like to go into detail on a few of the game's biggest pros, and some cons that could (and hopefully will) be fixed in the future.

Let's start with pros:

The building, heavens above the building in this game is Enshrouded's best feature by a country mile. A voxel based system with dozens of shape options allow you to very quickly go from building cubes to picturesque mansions and imposing castles overlooking any suitable piece of ground you care to build on. And, with the ability to place multiple flame altars as you increase the Flame Level, you can either slap as many as eight altars down in perfect distance and create an incredible megastructure, or have multiple fast travel points, towers, and builds wherever you please! 

My ONLY suggestion would be to allow for either more block options for building, and to allow certain block types to become available earlier on. These two together would be able to give even Minecraft a run for its money.

Next, the movement. This game has a great sense of momentum, in its gliding, grappling, and light platforming. The ability to move in this game rarely feels slow, even the 'walking' speed doesn't feel so sluggish that exploration is a bore. While I did prefer to glide more and more the further into the game I progressed, running from A to B to Z is rarely going to feel like a chore. If I were to leave a suggestion, it would be to ask for the Double Jump skill to become a basic movement option without skill points, and for base stamina regen to be a little bit higher.

Finally, combat. The ability to take on entire hordes of the undead, or of tribal-like scavengers feels like a lot of fun, and there are plenty of times that you can feel like a one-man army! Fighting multiple enemies with melee weapons seldom feels unbalanced (minus a few examples I'll get to,) magic is the best tree by far, and ranged is just as good if you can supply the necessary arrows. I would almost describe the combat as Souls-lite, with a no-i-frames dodge given to you from the start which helps you evade enemy attacks to retort with your own blows. Most bosses are fun to fight, with easy to learn attack patterns that can be countered and leave ample openings to fight back against the game's largest, most imposing enemies. Adding lightly on to this, looting is oftentimes rewarding in this game up until the highest levels available in Early Access, you will constantly be gaining new, better, or varied weapons that will compliment your desired playstyle.

My only want is a means to craft an endless supply of arrows, similar to the Eternal Spells offered to Wizards. I know there's much back and forth about this topic, but would like to offer that the eternal quivers have a slightly increased draw time, and are just as expensive to make as the eternal spells, even if it goes all the way up to the highest tiers.

Now, with those out of the way, onto the few gripes I do have with this game.

First, magic is the most busted class in the game, by far. Spells are plentiful, range is good, and even with Mana holding back the staves, wands can just as easily tear any enemy in front of you to shreds with little effort. Now, this isn't to say magic needs to be nerfed, rather that ranger and melee should receive some manner of buffs, so that endgame for any of the three primary builds (and their subclasses) feels fun, powerful, and most importantly balanced. As it stands now, mages need only find wands, staves, and craft a few eternal spells to feel like juggernauts with unstoppable power.

Rangers are forever at the mercy of twigs, stuck in an endless grind to farm down a simple collectible to craft their arrows. While this isn't a problem on paper, the fact remains that any one enemy on level with you could soak up a quarter or even half (more for bosses) of said arrow stack that you just crafted. And while spell charges are found everywhere, arrows are not so common. I have a chest full of spell charges, and two inventory slots with two different arrows in my current point of progression.

Lastly, melee simply feels...meh, at times. It can be strong with investment, but the payoff hits below the power mages are offered, and while mages can hit enemies from any range, all melee builds HAVE to carry a ranged weapon of some kind on hand to compete with any flying mob (and given the predatory fauna of the desert area is flying, you will never use a sword against it.) Merciless attack also feels underwhelming, even with extraordinarily high strength investment. For filling up an enemy's stagger bar, the damage is underwhelming (the highest on a level 30 enemy I've hit with a merciless strike was shy of 600 damage.) To put that in perspective, three casts of a wand on the same level could deal 600-700 with proper investment, and if it crits, go from 900-1100. The power gap is very noticeable.

Second con, a few enemies feel overtuned, particularly pulling from the Scavenger pile. Acid Cleaver Scavengers are one of the most unenjoyable enemies to fight in this game, possessing (for no reason other than 'experimentation') doubled attack speed and very high damage. For melee builds, parrying or just shielding against these enemies falls flat on its face, as the attack they threw sometimes hits through your parry, and if you are just blocking and trading blows, you will run out of stamina within three or four attack patterns. If other enemies are targeting you while an Acid Cleaver Scavenger is in your face, you're likely dead, or playing chicken to take out whatever else is attacking you.

Matrons are not nearly as bad as Acid Cleaver Scavengers, however their Acid Bite is severely overtuned, utterly decimating even the burliest builds and leaving you wide open for a follow-up attack, and they have a explode-on-death skill that gives you maybe a one second window to react before you die on the spot. My first time fighting a matron, I barely survived, just to be blown up when she fell.

Lastly, any small enemy such as the Shroud Beetles or Mice. These are the least terrible of the given examples, but their attack windows are very fast and they can hit as hard as medium to large enemies. Get a group together and you'll be a corpse in seconds. I feel that smaller enemies should have their damage numbers reduced to hit for their size. Annoying, but not lethal if something 'bigger' gets your attention mid-swarm.

Lastly on the cons, not all skills are created equal. This is a very minor gripe, but I've mentioned a few of the perks here like Merciless Attack, and by and large players will discover (often the hard way) that many skills are not worth investing in, or are an active detriment to the player character. A few tweaks made to said skills, allowing any build, and any class to shine in its own way and perform like the mage classes do, would go a long way in adding replayability and longevity in both single and multiplayer.

I feel like the gripes I do have, wordy as they are, are minor. Enshrouded is one of the few games I have just sat down and played with friends until I got done. Next to no time spent looking up optimizations online, only stopping to check where certain quest items/locations are if I'm having trouble, otherwise just immersing myself in the world of Embervale. The environmental storytelling of this game is also spectacular, and something I hope continues to receive as much thought and effort as the game creeps toward full release.

You must disengage then re-target the enemy that you wish to engage. Crashing is common for me when I access the map and zoom out.

The bones of the game feel solid. The skill system feels lacking. Obviously this part is subjective but skills like Martyr feel mostly pointless. Marty heals your team when you die. If you play well then Marty will never proc. Also, if you have Martyr, most likely your the best in the party at reviving fallen comrades. I want to like the necromancer skill but in a decent group they rarely proc because the more people there are the less likely you are the one that secures the kill.

The bug that caused me to stop playing initially has not happened since. I gave a thumbs down to not recommend the game, but that was too hasty. 

Pros:
- Game plays extremely smooth.
- Graphics are good and the world is immersive.
- One of the best crafting systems I've seen.
- A lot of cool survival elements without the really annoying ones, like hydration.
- The glider really opens up the world and is a fun feature.
- Magic very fun and done well. It seems balanced compared to the enemies.
- I love the bow mechanics. This game is hands down my favorite when it comes to bow play. (needs balanced).

Cons/Recommendations/My thoughts:
- Right now if you're not playing a wizard you are making life harder for yourself. Wizard, outside of acid, is balanced well. Hunter is a little too weak, and melee is almost useless.
- Wands break way too easy. By the time I finally get to a camp or cave that I need for a quest, the wand is 3/4 of the way gone already. You need two wands of each element. One to get you to the location, and one to actually get through the quest.
- The amount of arrows you craft per batch needs to be increased slightly. Not a lot, as I personally like hunting mats to craft arrows. The problem is the ratio of time to farm versus arrows crafted is off. You will spend a lot of time farming mats to make up hundreds of arrows only to burn through them in absolutely no time. Then you are back to farming for a couple nights after work before getting back out there.",1706750572,1708298634,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

My impressions are that this is a pretty good single player game that although you can bring friends along to enjoy with you, it's not much of a multiplayer game; especially if you create a dedicated server.

QUESTS

The quests in this game are meant to be done once, for one person, and if you don't happen to be that one person, or close enough to the quest objective when it is completed, you cannot complete it yourself unless you create a new game. I ran into that when my friends and I went for a Shroud Root on a group server, and I was just barely outside of the room when they killed it (I was busy scouting the rest of the zone, popping the pulsing spore creators and searching for chests). They all got the skill point, and I did not. Since then, I created my own world, and completed everything solo so that I don't miss anything when we play together.

There was also a quest toward the beginning with a mining camp to loot something from a chest behind a wall of rubble, and I was the only one to get credit even though everyone else was present. So as I said, it's not really a multiplayer game. It's a single-player game that you can invite friends along to assist you.

BUILDING

The building in this game is actually pretty nice. As you progress and discover new building blocks you can use, and find more materials to unlock more fanciness, you have a decent amount of choice for base building and decorating.

A lot of people bring up Valheim when they talk about this game, but I see it more akin to Minecraft since things can only be placed on the x,y,z axis with nothing more than 90 degree rotation for most building pieces. Decorations can rotate a little more freely, but the building blocks are stuck to 90 degree. Valheim on the other hand, you can rotate the building pieces 16 times. Meaning Enshrouded is stuck with rectangular floor plans, and Valheim can have rectangles, octagons, or even a hexadecagon (which is damn near a circle).

The good parts of building in Enshrouded vs Valheim, is while it is limited in rotation, it makes up for it in clean building. What I mean by that, is if you are building more than rectangles in Valheim, the overlapping pieces turn into a clipping nightmare. Floor panels are clearly overlapping, stone building pieces clip to damn near everything because it is so lumpy, and sometimes edges (usually from the outside) just look sloppy with gaps. On the other hand, with Enshrouded, if you build a wall next to a floor piece or a wall or ceiling tile, the edge gets blended with the previous object, except for corners, in which there are added single-tile pieces you can use to fill in the gaps smoothly as if you are in a ceramics class.

TALENT SYSTEM

I do enjoy games with talent/skill trees, and I think Enshrouded does theirs pretty well so far when it comes to differences in ""class types"". However I am concerned since I feel I explored maybe 1/3 of the whole map that we are able to move our mouse around on, which leads me to believe the game will still be some years before it is finished, which means way more content potential, and I already feel for the most part I made the best of my type of class I could make. Will we be end up just filling in the rest of the tree so we don't need to bother with respecs if we want to try something else? Or will the tree be expanded outward with more interesting choices as the game progresses?

I do personally find the choice to improve your mining or wood-chopping to be an incredible waste of talent points though, except if you are playing on a friends world and you are trying to help by farming materials. Then again I pretty much maxed those skills out on my solo world while also not feeling like I needed to max out every skill in my section of the tree.

As of now you can make a 2h melee, a sword/board tank, an archer, a HEALER (which is a nice touch if you join a friend's server), and a ""wizard"", which is a term I use very loosely.

The magic system in this game is a bit wonky, since you aren't actually create a character that can cast spells. You are creating a character that can use magic items to cast spells through. You find and create ""charges"" (ammo) for your staff so you can do fire, frost, lightning damage, and once the charges are out, you can't cast anything. Resting doesn't do anything. You must create more ammo for your stick, just like arrows with a bow.

It's not a bad thing necessarily, since a lot of times spell casters in games end up being overpowered just blowing everything out of the water while naked, and this game reigns them way back. So at the end you are down to melee or range. There was a special armor piece toward the end I picked up that mentioned doing unarmed melee damage, so perhaps that is an option as well. But overall you are melee or range. Spellcasters are simply archers with more flair.

SINGLE PLAYER GAME

This game can be fun with friends, it's true. However the thing that really solidifies this game as single player is the summoning of the profession NPCs. You get a staff to summon these guys into the game, and you can only have one of each per world. So if you create your first base and summon in the Blacksmith so you can start crafting stuff from the Blacksmith, if someone else creates a base elsewhere (you can have up to 8 Altars (base locations), and they summon the Blacksmith, the one in your base disappears until you summon him back.

You summon an NPC that allows you to build crafting stations, but creating the crafting stations doesn't allow you to craft the stuff they have to offer. What they are doing is giving you the ability to craft more materials for items they have to create FOR you. Only the Workbench at the start allows you to make certain actual items. Otherwise you are just smelting ore into bars, or creating charcoal, or turning wood logs into wood beams, or making Fabric or Leather or grinding bones and things into powders for other things the NPCs make for you. So having someone summon that NPC away from your base can actually suck more than you would think, because now you have to find the box you put your staff in to summon it back.

OVERALL THOUGHTS

I thought the game was pretty great for what it was. I don't necessarily see a lot of replay value in it unless you want to play with friends and try a different build. Or you are really hardcore about building the most epic base you can think of, while waiting for the next content patch to open up more options (like we do with Valheim at this point).

When I first started this game, all the reviews mentioned Valheim, so I use it as my obvious comparison point, but the truth is, I didn't get much ""Valheim"" in this. It felt more like Fable mixed with Minecraft. While this game does have a certain degree of ""survival game"" in it, it's much more a single player action-adventure based off the quests and storylines with some survival bits available if you want it.

CONTENT RELEASE WINDOW

One of the reasons people put Valheim on blast for is their slow release of content. But Valheim had a group of 5 people working on it when it came to Early Access. 7 Days to Die has like 1 dude working on it. The company behind Enshrouded is not new to games. It's not a tiny studio with a handful of people. I don't expect Valheim to push content quickly. I do expect Enshrouded to be pushed quicker than Valheim, but I am also not entitled and am willing to wait years until Enshrouded is fully realized.

Great atmosphere

Frustrating bosses that sometimes require cheese
Severe balance issues which get worse later in game
Weak survival elements
No Weather effects
Corpse Runs
Melee forced to perfectly parry almost all the time

Enshrouded walks a fine line in the soulslike genre between challenging and enjoyable to downright frustrating or sadistic poorly scripted fights which often forces the player to just simply employ cheese tactics to win and a janky mess of a combat system that is exceptionally unbalanced causing serious issues throughout the game for people who prefer minimal playstyles, which I'll explain in greater detail later.

The 'class system' is really for show, doesn't really do that much at all except give you a visual guide in what areas the skills benefit the most, honestly? This would make more sense just to condense it down to four catagories such as Ranged - Melee - Survival - Magic which would make more sense instead of trying to  be flashy.   

Survival lite,  there really isn't any survival.  Food doesn't perish, no weight limits, no weather effects, sure you can get cold etc but doesn't really do that much, food is exceptionally important only due to the pretty much essential buffs they provide especially for boss fights such as granting faster stamina regen or more HP.

A serious issue with the game is combat and boss balance, this the area enshrouded fails the most in my honest opinion after playing many many games over the decades, Enshrouded is a pure soulslike game so if you are new to that concept, it means the combat is punishing, difficult and sometimes downright unfair *but* there absolutely is a fine line here between difficult and frustrating, and right now - Enshrouded falls within the frustrating category due to several factors including janky controls,  poorly scripted boss fights and just questionable design in which the game is nearly impossible to beat with just one playstyle especially with death you drop your backpack which involves you doing a corpse run. 

So lets say you are a pureblood melee class,  that'll get you so far until you run into enemies or bosses that will insta-gib melee classes and force you to use magic or ranged,   then maybe you might run into bosses that are immune to ranged and melee so magic is the only way,  this becomes a major issue later in game were melee quickly becomes much too dangerous and wands/bows steadily become more and more viable simply because melee combat quickly devolves into requiring perfectly timed parries, all the time without fail and because chip damage exists, you can still take damage regardless. 

Many boss fights are suffer from being overtuned and poorly scripted plus have the potential for entirely being able to break the game,  some boss fights like thunderbrute are basically easy for most soulslike players, they move fairly slow and generally are balanced well for all types,  unfortunately this is where that stops and everything else falls apart.   Some bosses are either immune to various attacks or have instant death attacks if you get hit,  or you are forced to dodge 20 times (not joking) and then pinprick the boss for 1/100th HP and rinse and repeat for maybe an hour to win assuming you don't fail one dodge and instantly die - this is not the spirit of soulslike games at all, they are just poorly crafted time wasters and prove to be more frustrating than satisfying. 

Some bosses absolutely can cause gamebreaking issues,  Matron is notorious.   This boss has one simple attack, a spread of lingering poison bottles which a direct hit can do more than 50% HP damage and stun, making melee exceptionally difficult so often players will attempt to cheese the fight by digging or throwing bombs to make a hole however if it should fall through into the cave below - it can bug out and since the land above is now deformed, it can get trapped in a loop, but sniping this boss really is the ony way to go and unfortunately, this becomes par for the game where cheese tactics become almost necessary. 

Janky controls are a problem too, too much emphasis is placed on melee classes to do perfect parries each time since you can't really *tank* any enemies even though there is a class for it, but good luck in trying to melee tank bosses or even some late game regular shroud enemies without dodging and perfect parries.   Ranged combat has an issue too, and that is to zoom you have to hold down the Q button,  now since you have to be mobile...moving whilst holding Q down is clumsy and for certain boss fights like Wyvern where you need to shoot specific weak points whilst still being mobile makes it frustrating and janky,  now you can 'lock' onto a target but once again, for ranged this is just a general lock and you miss out on weak spots which for ranged builds, is critical.    Even right clicking to parry is janky, because there is an animation block where if you right click too soon nothing will happen forcing you to re-click, often making you accidentally double click and causing, sometimes a deadly error for your character.    This is entirely caused by the shield animation, when lowering your characters shield from the block position back to relaxed, there is a nearly a full second of animation where if you try to block during this phase, nothing will happen and during more intense fights, it can cause problems. 

One major positive though is the base building,  they did a great job with building pieces which snap together seamlessly and allow for significantly advanced bases since everything just snaps together nicely, even the ability to make some custom with the use of single blocks such as stair railings.  

Graphics wise, its really average for 2023/2024 gaming with some nice shadow and lighting affects, darkness is pitch black and honestly a bit overzealous with it, this is done to showcase the moon rise lighting effects and makes night time exploration more annoying than fun,  lack of being able to hold torches in off hand for instance,  you can find a few things to help exploring in dark areas but needs improvements for sure.

Magic is a huge problem in the game and honestly,  it needs scrapping and rebuilt.   Magic is more like ""alchemy"" than real magic, since you need spell charges which are limited *AND* you also need mana,  and sure spells like fireballs hit harder than any other attacks but not nearly enough to warrant serious time crafting or farming charges for boss fights only to die during a boss and forced to re-farm charges and mana potion bottles because again, natural regeneration does not happen unless you have items that grant you regeneration. 

Overall, enshrouded is a mixed bag and isn't for everyone at all.  Some people who like difficult soulslike games will find a solid challenge in Enshrouded, whilst others will find more frustration than enjoyable gameplay.   Bear in mind, Enshrouded is absolutely Early Access and I expect new features and hopefully better balancing in the coming months, some boss fights need to be toned down for sure and have viability for all play styles without limiting to ranged or magic only,  world options would solve many problems where you can either tone down the difficulty, or increase it if you so desire. 

I don't hate Enshrouded at all,  right now I'd give it a negative/positive middle ground and that is only due to some boss fights need attention so players don't have to resort to cheese tactics in other to safely stand a chance of winning, or more annoying boss fights like Wyvern which requires the bow to stun otherwise its nearly impossible.   Hopefully once this game cooks more, I'd like to give this game and the developer a positive review but,  have to keep it real and offer constructive feedback - Enshrouded is promising and hopefully just gets better and better with time in the oven.",1708293488,1708293488,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Enshrouded felt like discovering a hidden treasure chest in the world of video games! It was unlike any other game I had tried before - and it was budget-friendly too. Once I started playing, I was amazed at how quickly it loaded, and seamlessly it performed. The game itself felt expertly written, taking advantage of all CPU cores and available memory to create a snag-free experience. I recall two crashes over about 150 hours which were easily recovered. Even when playing with friends who lived far away, there was no lag or delay - it was as if we were all right there together, having a blast!

The best part about Enshrouded? Every time I turned a corner, there was something new to discover. The quests felt like solving exciting puzzles, and were written well. Taking time to read the letters unlocked a captivating overarching story told through notes left behind from people striving to survive the oncoming shroud.

The combat system was fantastic! Whether I was up close in a melee battle or using magic or arrows, it was like a dance of attack and defense. You couldn't just hack and slash faster. Opponents had distinct attacks requiring you to change your approach. While I focused more on the melee builds, my friends using magic or archery found they could easily join in and contribute in their own way with special skills and many ways to customize how your character excelled.

Gliding through the air in Enshrouded was exhilarating! It was intuitive and reminded me of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Be careful, though. Your glider will be invaluable to you and also one of the most frequent causes of your demise. There are many things you don't want to fly into and it's easy to accidentally launch yourself into peril during a series of acrobatic moves trying to go where you maybe aren't supposed to. :) I'll leave it at that. 

The itemization was well done. I was always on the lookout for better gear to make my character even stronger. I'm learning of items that I have yet to find in my playthroughs. I continue to stumble upon secret places despite having the map completely revealed. There is always some small nook I passed over before.

Building your base in Enshrouded is easy, allowing both part-snapping, and free placement. Rotation is available on the x-axis. The voxel-based interaction between building materials is one of the things that makes Enshrouded stand apart from other similar games. I'm still finding ways to combine materials.

So what's not to like? What could be improved?

There are a few things that, while small and likely on their list to tackle, would make the experience even better.

Allowing building parts to rotate on both the X and Y axis would unlock quite a few grand construction ideas.
Allowing armor pieces to be salvaged would also be welcome, even if that made it more expensive to enhance items.

Is it worth it? Yes. Would I recommend it to friends? Already have. And I can't wait for future updates. You can easily tell there is a lot more coming from the team at Keen. Just looking at the amount of land waiting to be sculpted will give you a sense of how much we have look forward to.",1708289356,1708289356,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Let me list some of my complaints: Slopes are as slippery as black ice. Have fun stepping on a perfectly walkable, though somewhat slant, patch of rubble and slide towards your doom (i.e. some kind of lava). The game is also a cataract simulator: Sometimes the fog gets so dense you barely see anything at all, which will sooner or later lead to a misstep (see above). Or the next tile after a pebble could be lava. Getting your stuff back after you die is sometimes nearly impossible, especially if you fall into a canyon. Controls are sluggish and all over the place (hitting space sometimes results in double jump, sometimes in glide). Auto-aim is haphazard and does not consistently target the closest enemies. Luckily, they are as stupid as a box of rocks, and you can camly hit them from higher ground. Farming, especially of flax, is a clickfest and may inflame your index joint.

  - There is no way to indicate what is in the box, which makes warehouse sorting/logistics a nightmare. You can either name each drawer by hovering over it, or place a drawing of a specific item on the front.
  - The item construction mode is missing. For example, the construction of an adjustable row and group of 2x2, 3x3, etc. Installing each drawer/machine/decor manually one at a time is very tedious if you are building a large base.
   - Book of recipes. I would like to see what this or that item can be used for.

When I was able to get the it to run this is the 411...

This is NOT the next big thing. I want to love Enshrouded but my feelings amount to a love-hate pendulum that keeps taking me for a ride. There is a lot of good stuff here and I have mostly enjoyed playing it but the thought of continuing is unappealing. It is a large-scale scavenger hunt with average building mechanics. A nice chill game to explore. The problem is that I don’t see it as a long-term proposition. 

Combat! 

1) The combat feels “off,” especially melee. Never have I been so challenged to kill a bolt of cloth or a barrel. You jump past it and your character is constantly spazing out. On that note, most wooden crates are about as challenging as the mobs. Blocking does not feel right and I can’t even say why. It feels slow to respond. I’m always pulling out the wrong weapon. It might be me but its not happening in other games.

Depth! 

2) It is not a deep game. Yes, there is lore. As you advance it’s more of the same. It has a scattered feeling to it. The exploration is fun . . . but also frustrating as you spend so much time trying to find your way around a mountain. The sense of progress is largely absent and there is no excitement about moving deeper into the game. It’s just there.

Quests! 

3) The game keeps giving me quest that are way above my level and gear. Why does it do this? I walk into a cave passage to get 1-shot murdered without warning. The mobs in the narrow passage (the only way to the quest marker) are 5 levels higher! That system needs to be calibrated. Most of the quests are the same. A different kind of example is the Wispwyvern boss. Nothing in the game is challenging – if it’s near your level – and then the Wispwyvern eats you. It is overpowered compared to anything else in the game. You need to kill it to progress so it gives you a feeling of being stuck. 

Price! 

4) The $30 price tag is too much. A better price point is necessary for an early access game that is clearly not polished or done.

Map!

5) The poor map is a mess. After a while it is covered with icons that look too similar. It’s a cluttered mess. I just...

Other Things! 

6) Am I even leveling? Oh, wait, I am! Again, there is a little sense of progression. Can we even talk with other people in-game? So strange. The game does not educate you on things like the deadly shroud.  You die to understand. It’s hateful. Why is the loot the same no matter what level enemy you kill? Why is everything the same? Why am I still logging in?

What I like...

The building is fun but nothing revolutionary. There is no motivation to build a 2nd house; just place another flame alter. I really like the crafting people that you can place at your base. It’s unique and works for me. It’s a beautiful game. It might be a bit dark for some people but it looks great. It is fun to explore (to a point). Chopping down trees is fun.

It is a solid foundation for a game but needs much attention. Once again, my boys have watched my experience with Enshrouded and decided not to buy it.

There isn't a button for ""meh"" or ""ambivalent"" or ""it's okay but..."". There are things that are fundamentally wrong that shouldn't be. That's why we have early releases and people who review, to point these things out. This game has a few of those that don't break the game but are disappointing when you realise they're present.

INVENTORY
Why is there no option to drop items? Seriously, I am not kidding, you cannot drop items. You can delete them though, that's sensible.

To the confused among the comments, being able to drop items out of your inventory is a ""page 1"" function for inventory management. The idea that you can't dump something on the ground for two minutes while you pick up something else is like going back to the dark ages of gaming.

Not everything is salvageable and not everything is desirable to delete, especially right at the start when you've picked up everything you see like a normal person because you have no way to know what might be useful. Picking stuff up being the only way to know that, it kinda limits your options when you do have a full inventory and there's something new lying on the deck.

And then of course you need to make the first shrine. Not happening with a full inventory, no sir.

Seems silly to give it a positive rating when a basic feature like this is missing.

Don't get me started on the tedious cooking mechanic, or the fact they shot their wad and made the grappling hook/glider available straight out the gate.
Put a schematic for the glider in the that big old tower... Make it worth climbing.

UPDATE
My comments about the inv management and tedious cooking stand, but at least the cooking isn't essential for the game. I've avoided it completely and it haven't yet run into a situation where I thought ""Hmm, maybe if I ate some of 'that' before this fight..."".
Which then begs the question ""why bother having it all?"". It is basically just a buff that you don't need.
In Valheim (as an example) your choice of food directly affects the outcome of, well, everything you do. It's pivotal to your success and can also be balanced to suit your playing style. It feels more like an afterthought than a fully fleshed out idea.

LOOT LOOPS
[spoiler]Four crafting stations, sorry four ""Craftspeople"", in and a goodly chunk of the lower left map uncovered I find the loot is repeating itself, a lot. It's almost not worth opening the chests. All my weapons are Legendary already. (Yes, I farmed a bit). How many rings of samey sameness am I going to have to delete? Why don't they give runes too?
Having read other reviews that say the loot drops are like this throughout, I'm inclined to stop looking for chests and just blitz the game through to the end.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]That spectral shield, you know the one you can't create until you get materials that aren't found anywhere apart from up in the tower or the relevant crafts person? Why is it so much worse spec than the metal one? That was a stand out disappointment once it was crafted.[/spoiler]",1706537769,1708276420,False,2,0,0.387205332517623901,4,True,False,True

Pros: Looks good, plays well, and generally was engaging for the duration of my play through.
Cons: Crafting and resource collection is the primary mechanism the game uses to slow the player down. 

This game is about as self evident as it comes. When I purchased it, I was looking for a survival game and Enshrouded delivered. I appreciate the way that Enshrouded approaches the genre. The focus of the game is on exploration with different stages gate-kept by upgrading your flame alter to explore further. When it comes to crafting and collecting materials, these are in service of exploration. I spent most of my time gathering resources to upgrade the flame alter / crafting potions or armor that would allow me to collect the next set of resources to ostensibly do the same thing. 

Reaching the end game, there would be times all I could do was wait for a certain resource to grow to craft a potion for example. Earlier in the game, I could fill these wait times with the exploration. However, once you uncover most of the map, the objectives become much more about being prepared to face enemies and without the potion I would be unable to progress, so the only solution was to wait. 

If you enjoy survival games, I would give Enshrouded a try.",1708275746,1708275746,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I love the specs that the characters can have and the story line is decent as  long as you do not mind reading.  The game  demonstrates the ability to navigate  and explore through a very diverse topographic world. The game has the best combat system of any builder that I have played, though whoever designed the assassin talents needs to do quite a bit more research or rename it sniper.

There are some  questions:

The first being, if there are only five people to rescue, why can the base/town be  so vast? What am I suppose to do with all  of that extra space?

The second:  Why don't crafts people  (NPCs) need bedrooms and work  areas  like medieval dynasty or dragon quest builders? If NPCs needed both these this woudl help warrant the size of the base and add a sleep/work  cycle  of  realism.

The third: is there a point to building the base out of elaborate, ornate or durable materials?  Wil the base ever be attacked?

The fourth: Will the assassin spec ever be turned into an assassin type character? Right, other than  sneak attack its basically a sniper with most of its talents really more appropriate for the marksman. The talents should focus on poisons, luring enemies away form their group, faster sneaking that uses stamina,cliff climbing, blow gun, distractions and smoke bombs. Many of the things assassins would use to single out targets for the quick and silent kill.

The fifth: While there are devices that are automated, will teh craft NPCs ever actually be automated like in medieval dynasty? Will I be able to give them commands as long as I provide the raw materials?

The sixth: Is there any chance of more NPCs? Maybe ones that can gather raw materials?

The seventh: Will there be any voice acting in dialogues? This can go a long way to adding an immersive effect. 

The eighth: IS there any possibility for branching paths like in Baldur's gate III?

The ninth: While the glider helps is there any thought towards mounts to help reduce the traverse times? 

The game itself is awesome and highly addictive and it has one of the strongest foundations of an early access game. The big question is what will the follow through look like.",1708274917,1708274917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game itself is very playable and a lot of fun with good progression and character build options, I myself tend to play magic types and I was able to find a viable build that worked with a good degree of survivability without becoming too easy and still encountering mobs / groups of mobs that would have the adrenaline flowing as you tried to stay alive.

The base building mechanics I actually love, with the ability to find more building recipes giving your base 
a different look and feel and the different crafters within your base give additional options as you find more materials and with game progression. Underground bases are also an option as foundation blocks can be used to quickly remove terrain by placing and removing them within the ground (did I mention all of the terrain can be altered?, though the only terrain that will remain altered is within your altar boundary)

My one gripe is I'm now maxed out at 25, have completed most or all of the quests and am waiting on an update patch or roadmap to see where the game goes from here, meanwhile I think I'll build a bat cave, or a tower......

You can play and enjoy the game as it is; I estimate it takes between 40 and 60 hours to complete. It might take a little longer for 100% achievements and a fully cleared map.

That being said, I believe the game has room for improvement. The diversity of enemies and AI could be enhanced, perhaps with the addition of a future snow biome to provide more content. There are also some animation issues and bugs, and the late-game loot system could benefit from less RNG and more emphasis on crafting. For example, instead of relying on luck to find loot, players could be required to farm high-tier resources, defeat high-tier bosses, and utilize NPCs for crafting.

At the moment though it's a horrible new player experience, I nearly refunded as I'd got stuck on a bridge and it was telling me I needed a grappling hook. My only way down was to jump off and of course I died and lost all my stuff, but my grave marker wasn't where I died it was up on the bridge. So yes, I could either forget all my stuff, or get back on to the bridge to get it, but then have no way off but to jump and die, and lose all my stuff again. Brilliant design....

You see that there's an expansive skill tree and think great! Then you see that that after 5 hours you're still only level 2 and realise the grind is insane.

You encounter ""the shroud"" which is basically just an area that once you enter a 5 minute timer starts until you die (and lose all your stuff), which would be fine if you could just dip in and out, but I've found that it takes most of that 5 minutes just trying to find what you're looking for in the fog, and you better hope you don't actually have to fight anything because that's your timer run out and whoops your dead.

I got to the first boss fight, which of course is in ""the shroud"" and by the time I got there I had 2 minutes left on the 5 minute timer, then the boss took down virtually all my health with one hit and so I had to run back to the start with my remaining 90 seconds to heal up. Then I ran back and he'd reset back to full health and I just thought nah, I can't be bothered with this.

- Graphics are pretty good.. But distance views are terrible.

- Character creation is basic. Needs major update.
- Loot is seemingly competitive with drops when in a group. Everyone wants to get to the enemy to take the loot. That needs fixing to be like Valheim perhaps. 
- Needs weapon sheath (personal preference.. but seems like a simple thing to do that they have not bothered with).

There is a lot of grinding for game advancement, but it is totally worth it. Since it is so complex, having gamers posting on Youtube has been invaluable to the enjoyment of this game.
It is a huge world which leads to a suggestion I feel would certainly enhance the enjoyment of players: Devs please let us add markers that are actually useful. Text markers would be so helpful to let us know what it is that I am marking. Is it a a danger area, a farming area and what am I farming here? Right now the making system based on 4 little pictures is very poor and seems more like for a 6 year old.
I do thoroughly enjoy being able to farm advanced weapons and armor if one is totally committed to risk and thoughtful planning and farming.
I love the Glider system and the spires that help to reach difficult to traverse areas.
The altar system to allow early rapid travel is a great unique consideration.
I would like to see a bigger earlier storage system without farming so much. This includes both the backpacks and storage boxes. I think it would allow more enjoyment with less stress. 
On the aspect of coop gaming this is a fairly weak way to get together: for instance, I was looking to get into
an early game with other players only to find I got into a game where 2 people were building a base. Not very helpful-totally wasted my time. I don't what you can do about that. There seemed to be no way to get anything out of that.
Overall, I would definitely give this game an A.

When I bought the game, it crashed two times, but then worked for long enough (unfortunately) for me to play well past the refund time limit. Sometimes it might work for hours once you get past the first couple of minutes without a crash. I've played a lot of games in Early Access and this is unfortunately the worst of them all in terms of crashing. The gameplay and the game are nice (when you can play without it crashing), but the constant crashing outweighs the positives and therefor this negative review.

My computer meets the recommended specs and I've done everything in the various troubleshooting guides, including reinstalling different versions of GPU drivers with DDU, running the game as administrator, installing the latest Vulkan runtime, turning down graphics settings and so on. Nothing helped, still getting crashes randomly. It's soon a month after it got released into Early Access and the issue still haven't been fixed, despite several hotfixes being released.

If you still decide to give the game a shot and you experience [i]""enshrouded.exe has crashed!""[/i] crashes within the first two hours, this isn't a good sign and consider refunding it until the developers fix this bug. I hope they fix the crashes asap, because it would be a really nice game without the random crashing. If you don't get any crashes, enjoy the game.

Playing solo, so I cannot comment on the co-op features, but for me it plays like a single player rpg with crafting and building elements. It is not really a survival game, which is absolutely fine by me. Has it got a good story? I dunno -- I have largely ignored the story in favour of exploration and levelling, which are what I most like in rpg's. And don't let the early access put you off; as best I can judge, this plays like a fully fleshed out game and I still have a lot of the map still to cover.

Fun game, but zero customer service. Griefing is a major problem -- if you play a public game, trolls will just destroy everything you have built in 2 minutes. You dont get notified this is happening, you cant see a record of who did it, the destruction takes no time at all, and you cant even see that someone joined your server unless you accidentally look at the map after someone has joined. This game can be fun in SINGLE PLAYER only, but do not try public games and do not try to reach the dev. They dont gaf about customer service, like so many other devs today.

The word, creative, comes to mind when I think of this game overall.  There were 2 things about this survival game that sparked my interest enough to purchase it.  The shroud, of course, because it's unique to any others, and the detailed build options.  The way this game is setup allows you to explore, harvest, just about any object, anywhere given the right tool and you may even get some items to pickup upon its destruction!

There's various lore items hidden around if you like story driven games and quests to accomplish in whatever order you wish to go for.  The game does provide some direction so you can following the path, but not forced.

[h1]Review Details[/h1]
For interested parties, the details of my full game-play review.

[h2]The Likes[/h2]

[olist]
    [*] I don't have to eat/drink/etc to stay alive, it's a buffing system.
    [*] I love to build and I'm able to do anything I want in the given aloud space even if I want to have a basement or a hollowed out rock cave for my workshop.
    [*] Though its not realistic, I like the game re-spawn so I can go back to a known area and gather resources again and again.
    [*] [spoiler]Glider!! I love the glider and the fact I don't get hurt when I crash and burn land.[/spoiler]
    [*] Views, I must say it's great to look around and see all the areas you will eventually get to.
[/olist]

[h2]The Dislikes[/h2]

[olist]
    [*] Though I do love everything re-spawning, I don't love the bosses/mobs re-spawning.  It makes it difficult to advance further along as a solo player when you go back to a town you cleared out only to get ambushed again.  This doesn't include animals and such, just the quest area and abandoned town mobs.
    [*] No rake options - would like to have an option to rake a path or clear an area for a campfire without having to locate a path and rake to the area I want to clear out.  Just like, if I want to rake over a path to have grass instead without disturbing the ground itself (Valhiem is a good example)
    [*] Limited alters (2) which contributes to the minor frustration that if you have only 2 areas to fast travel back to, the further you go into the game you have to either 1) destroy your built residence to move your alter to a new location. or, 2) hack'n slash your way through mobs over and over again to get back to where you were exploring/questing.
[/olist]

[h2]The Wishes[/h2]
I understand the ideas I've listed below may already have been considered by development, but just in case, future considerations;
[olist]
    [*] If not more alters to put down, another source to provide fast travel around the map, if there's not something already. Or, the ability to fast travel to completed quest areas?
    [*] Trainable animal(s) to ride for faster travel?
[/olist]

[h2]The Finds[/h2]
Just some things I found while playing I thought were worth sharing:
[olist]
    [*] I build a wall close to a tree that's outside of my build zone, the branches go into my build area and when I walk to the tree limbs it doesn't allow me to walk through them, but it's more of a box I have to jump over.  Minor issue, but thought I'd report it since most likely it wasn't a though unless you're a castle building type.
[/olist]

The story is intriguing enough to keep me wanting to know more.
The world is full of interesting places to explore, (some more than others)
The terra-forming you can do with the voxel based engine make the whole experience unique compared to other survival games. There was one point I just dug straight down into the ground until I dropped into a cavern where the waypoint was. Another time, there was a bugged ""puzzle"" and so I just mined through the wall to get around it. 
The combat is fun enough, though AI could use some work in terms of strategy. Hitboxes of objects in the world need SERIOUS work. As an Archer right now in Early Access, you will miss half your shots if you're trying to be sneaky due to the hitboxes of railings, trees, bushes, the ground, etc. 
The building in this game is something special... you can meticulously place each small block or build using prefab parts, and the peices you build with start molding together as you put peices next to each other, giving everything you build a very permanent feeling within the world, like it's built Into the world instead of feeling out of place ever, no matter your creation. 
I am really looking forward to seeing how far the devs can and will take this game. I've been taking my time so far, haven't even reached level 25 yet (which I believe is current max level? correct me if im wrong), trying to explore all the areas. I would love to see this entire system fleshed out to a point where max level ends up being like 100. The way the map is currently, it APPEARS like the locked off areas would be the level 25-50 areas of the world... and based on what happens with the story there, I could see moving on to a whole different map after completing this one, a far more advanced one technically/mechanically and story-wise where it gets to the root of the infection and stopping it. 
Maybe an area with actual water? ;-) 

Overall super excited to see where this game goes. For the price I paid for the game, I'd be completely satisfied if this one map is all is ends up being. However I could see this being expanded upon a LOT

8/10 in it's current state with the potential to be a 9 for sure. 

PS I keep thinking this little conspiracy theory that maybe they originally had plans to have Water and water physics in the game, but with all the terra-forming it ended up being too much of an issue so they just turned it all into that red-death fungus and said ""what water issue?""

I finished the game using 8gb of ram and it was very playable. I upgraded to 64gb of ram and there was very little difference (at this stage).

I finished every quest and uncovered 95% of shroud (without looking online). I played through with a warrior class for the most part. 

Issues have been extremely low for early access. There's a lot of things they've done really well and a few things that can be improved. Overall, I've been enjoying every minute of it and look forward to more. One of the best early access games I've ever played. 

Unlike most sandbox games, this game helps you speed things along. You spend most of your time adventuring which is fantastic. Crafting, resources and travel are all fast pleasant affairs and maybe a touch too easy. The world is pretty massive and content rich for the first 60-70% of the game. After that, it gets rather repetitive. 

Battle interactions are OK but can be underwhelming majority of time and especially late in game. Bosses are way too simple right now and have a lot of path finding issues. Throughout the game, they do catch you with a few pleasant surprises but we need way more. 

Controls can be a touch janky at times but that's a minor gripe. Not knowing if the controls are going to cooperate on risky jumps adds to the heart-pounding suspense at times which is needed. You can master the jank (mostly) so it's not too bad.

My recommendation is to wait for a few big updates. Give them a chance to back-fill some content and to increase the challenges. There's a lot of underwhelming moments because it's missing challenges. It would be well worth the wait I think. Still a pretty great experience but it's going to be fantastic in a few more months I suspect.",1706643993,1708214914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

For such a new indie game, Enshrouded is extremely well-polished. I have run into few bugs and the game systems all seem well thought out. This feels like a game made by people who want to play it.

The graphics are nice, performance is usually pretty good, and it feels like the developers thought ahead and implemented quality-of-life features that take most developers years of feedback to implement. The music is great. The enemies feel reasonably varied. Changes to the world only save within the boundaries of your flame, so you don't have to worry about ruining the aesthetic of any other areas during resource collection.

I saw a lot of articles praising the building system in this game, and I shrugged it off until I actually constructed by second house. The building system is fantastic. The ability to place such small blocks and the automatic edge trimming allows you to get far better control and detail in your building than any other sandbox game I've ever played.

Some constructive feedback I would give:
- Some of the resources feel a little sparse in the early game. For instance, I went the archer path and I struggled constantly for enough sticks to make arrows until I unlocked the farmer and discovered I could grow shrubs for sticks. Scrap metal is sometimes difficult to acquire and disappears fast once you start making better furniture.
- Some resources should have more than one recipe to create. For instance, I feel like I should be able to make twigs out of logs on the sawmill, and make charcoal out of hardwood, which is more plentiful at higher levels. 
- I'm not super fond of the way quests carry over on a character between worlds. I joined a newer world with my first character and started getting duplicate quests from the early game, which feels wrong. I'm not sure how best to handle that, but I don't like the idea of racking up duplicated quests in my quest log.
- I would like to have the option for a ""creative mode"" so I could play with building vast structures and higher tier materials without spending hours collecting resources.",1708211017,1708211017,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

They've thought of everything here! From mechanically top controls, smart crafting and management system, not complicated, big and yet not distant, verticality!!!!, accessibility through double jump, glider > you can climb every mountain from almost every side < Even if it doesn't look like it, you still can do it! Just search the little green textured areas! I have had the craziest mountaineering experiences in this game! Grappling hook works only on certain points! Then the catas, the caves, the super great world design in general, the mood, the music, the graphics, the possibilities, no bugs!!!, so many quests, so much to see, so much to explore, so much to do and yet manageable, so much love. NOT souls like!! It's like SKYRIM & MINECRAFT together! Easy combat system: roll sideways or backways and attack! And you can play a hybrid class, just like in Skyrim. And you should! 

I read here someone complaining about: ""fighter class is not mature and now I have to search 20+ minutes for materials there to get arrows here"" bla bla. Boy, if you would be alone in such a world, would you really just go ahead with a sword, from the beginning?!!!! And that boys review just shows how fast he wanted to get through! It's a game where you have to pause with quests, to get your other stuff. And that's normal!!! OMG, a typical kid with no inner peace! If you have not the time for a long-term game go play Fortnite or other fast paced crap, that continues to destroy your nerves! 

To continue, you can play Enshrouded completely solo!!!!!!!  There is no need to play with others!!! And I am super hard to convince when it comes to ""new"" games! Btw, this doesn't feel a bit like an early access game. Other companies should take this kind of quality as an example of how an ""early access"" game should look like. For me it feels like a full blown hundret times patched title. Yea, sometimes the one or the other texture doesn't make it through the texture streaming completely, but you still see the texture!! So what? Once you're engrossed in the game, you won't even notice it anymore. And it rarely happens. And hey, it's still an early access game?!!! xD And the best thing is, it can only get better! 

You like Sykrim? you liked Minecraft? Then buy the game and don't you dare complain, because THEN you have a completely different problem! Believe me! 

These developers deserve all the praise! The last time I was so happy was with Skyrim! The only thing missing here are character interactions. But to be honest, I don't miss all the bla bla! You still get something to read and you get your own tribe of helpers like a blacksmith, an archer, a farmer, an alchemist, etc. who you can place in your home anywhere you want and who will always greet you when you arrive and watch where you go!",1707240929,1708210272,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I cant recommend the game in this current state, its just unfinished/very very unpolished. The devs missed out on some key features that eventually make this game just, super super tedious and unfun.
1. No Drop button - Inventory management is a nightmare being unable to simply drop items on the ground. If you are out in a dungeon and bags are overfilled with loot, only option is to destroy things. Why is a basic feature missing/
2. Stamina Regen- You are constantly, just out of stamina. Running costs stamina, mining, Jumping, dodging, etc all costs an excessive amount of stamina, and the regen is way too slow. Mining feels like you are swinging your pick 3 times, then waiting a full 20 seconds for your stamina to regen, because if you take any other action, the regen stops. A short sprint, your stamina is empty and guess what, you cant open your glider without stamina so you are very likely to jump and fall to your death. 
3- No mounts - Traversing this massive map is a CHORE and just not fun as slow as you have to run, without any faster options even with the fast travel teleports. To initially explore the map, it takes forever especially due to the poor stamina system. 
4- The shroud - The games main feature, the ""shroud"" areas of poison that you need to explore in order to progress. You need to manage your time inside because you have a timer for how long you can last. If the timer hits 0, you just die. Neat idea, and overall decent, except when you take into account the patches ALL OVER THE PLACE, of red ""Deadly Shroud"" that instantly deplete your timer. The devs put this into the game, and hid small patches of the stuff all over, in foggy poorly lit and low visibility areas, so that if you are running around exploring, and set a single toe inside the hidden red, you suddenly die, drop all your items, and have to corpse run to get everything back. I get  marking off progression in areas possibly until you unlock a way to survive the more deadly shroud or clear it. But why in the hell would you put tiny hidden areas of it all over the place just to punish you for exploring or trying to kill you randomly. its, not, fun. Its annoying. 
5. Inability to climb - To everyone saying you dont need to climb, you can just take 10 hours to mine a short tunnel to get up on a ledge, go away, i dont need your opinion here. You are basically doing the equivalent of rubbing 2 sticks together to accomplish the same task as a lighter and saying its more fun. You still have the option to take a week to dig a tunnel to climb a hill if they put any sort of climbing system in place. Currently its a silly way to pad the game time forcing people to either run around or make a tall ramp up a steep hill instead of just giving us the ability to climb up ledges. Again, its just not fun. Give us the choice at least, or bare minimum make the grappling hook more usable than it is. Currently you can only fire it at set hooks, its all but useless and a terrible game mechanic as is. 
6- Crafting - Extremely terrible system as is, i dont know who designed it but they needed to actually test it out. Its bloated in the sense that theres just a dozen different crafting tables, and people, and things all necessary and nothing overlaps which causes you to run around trying to figure out what special device you need to make the material you need to go back and hunt down the random NPC who can finally craft your end product. then do it 20 more times. Just condense the things so you arent running around wasting time trying to figure out what can be crafted where.
I get , that the game is in early access, and theres bound to be bugs, and things necessary for improvement, but the majority of the issues currently seem to stem from just a lack of common sense on the developers part. How a game like this can be pushed through to the public without a drop items button is beyond me and just feels like the devs were lazy.  

IN summary, give the game 6 months before you regret your purchase currently. Its very unpolished and needs more time in the oven to cook.",1708090599,1708210249,False,1,0,0.42096218466758728,0,True,False,True

After 70 hours I keep trying to enjoy the game. It just lacks anything to do after a certain point. I could build all day but after a certain point that becomes less fun. The unfortunate part about the game is you run out of quests very quickly and the EA map is not as large as you think. The combat is mid at best. I dont want to say everything is bad about the game. I did enjoy it for what it was but as far as a long term game it is not that in its current state. I hope that they do add more to do overall. The weapon variety while it seems like there are tons of options are actually very small. The skills are the best part of the game. Lots of different builds to play and tons of different playstyles. The problem is that there is a lack of content to use the different builds on.

Overall the game has the bones to be a great game just lacking the meat. POIs are not interesting and the combat needs work. The game does not label itself as a survival game but I think leaning more into what makes a lot of survival games fun will help this game a lot.

-Horrible engine.

-Camera movement locked at 60fps even if you have more than 60fps the engine is locked so if you're used to high fps don't waste your money.

Just refund or play something else until is fixed , right now it's a huge mess , some AMD cards are unplayable (Game won't even open) good pc's will have constant crashes , shaders loading infinitely , server issues etc...

-Save game issues, including progress loss, crashes upon loading saves, and corrupted save files.

-The game crashes immediately upon launch, preventing you from even entering the game world in some cases.

Gameplay has ton of bugs like

-Damage while mining .

-Items disappearing.

-Crafting recipes not working correctly.

-Incorrect resource requirements.

-Enemies getting stuck in animations.

-Attacks not registering and hitbox issues.

-Inconsistent behavior of miasma zones and unclear effects on player health.

-Structures not placing correctly.

-Resources not spawning properly.

-Falling through the world , players clipping through the map and getting stuck in unintended locations.

-Animal AI issues , animals behaving erratically, getting stuck in environments, and not reacting as expected.

-Resource duplication , exploits allowing players to duplicate resources, potentially affecting game balance.

-Graphical glitches , visual artifacts, textures not loading properly, and lighting issues.

You get access to fundamental things like a glider, grapple and a wand very early in the game. You can use magic as a basic attack without mana costs or needing to eat mana food at all! I really enjoy the skill trees (existing and) being simple  - not like the (IMO) insane POE or Diablo style trees where you have to follow guides to even play - allowing for unique builds with clothing and weaponry all available for specific play styles. 

A lot of classic Zelda vibes with the exploration, puzzles, glider, grappling hook etc. Growing up with OoT this is definitely a pro for me and not a criticism.

Inventory management / crafting can be a blessing and a curse sometimes but this games doesn't force you to do it at all, you can fight or farm or build or explore pretty freely and I really enjoy being able to do whatever I want whenever I want without having to prep for 15-30 minutes to do it. 

My biggest complaint would be that some of the enemies are pretty dumb but as I'm early in the game and learning, it really doesn't bother me yet.

They disable functional healing for weak mage build to ""fix"" the ""imbalance"".

Well, it was imbalanced and that was WHY mages had healing since they are so squishy.

Anyways,another initial great game fated to unnecessary ""fixes"". 

Also still no toggle to run.

I'm still going to recommend this game because if you see this game more centered around gathering resources and doing quests for the sake of building your base, this game is excellent in that regard. 

But if you're looking for more, it really doesnt expand into combat depth or enemy variety much and some aspects are wonky.

But if you love creating your own world and building your own house, then this is for you.

Now that i have played through the whole content of the first part of early access i can give you more info. 
This far is only 25% of the game that is released. 25% of the map. The content of that, with very little house building (i literally have only a shed), is enough to keep you busy for 70-80 hours. But not 80 hours of chores. The game is fun to play, really easy to play with up to 16 players and the progress does not feel cumbersome or tedious or repetitive. New fascinating areas all the way to level 25 and many hidden secrets to unlock. The game has quest, you do not blindly venture into vast areas of danger, it has a quest line to guide you through upgrades and loot while you level. For me this is a key factor when comparing to Valheim or Minecraft for example. 
Building is just the cherry on top.

First of all, the action combat is fast paced, highly mobile, well telegraphed, and has enough tactical depth to make fights interesting in multiplayer.  Second of all, movement is very very joyful.  I always like to be in the air for as long as possible in the games I play, and the gliding really delivers here.  Thankfully there is also not a hunger meter.  I hate this mechanic personally, some people don't, but I like the concept of food.  Here you eat to buff before your adventure and occasionally as a snack on the road and I like that a lot.  
But the place that Enshrouded really shines for me is their world.  Its a lot like a more complex version of Shadow and Bone's shadow fold but with a mushroom theme.  The visuals and the audio really mesh together perfectly to make you feel uneasy and claustrophobic every time you go in, no matter how many times you go in.  Having the shroud as an adversary makes the entire experience more focused, and really immerses you in the world.
If I had one wishlist item, I feel like I want the shroud to fight back.  At one point this shroud covered everything.  I keep thinking of the early alpha of Fire Fall where the monsters from the mists would come and raid the safe places and over time could take back the map.  That's maybe the only thing that's missing, and its not ENTIRELY missing, the creatures from the shroud do make sorties outside of it but only if you happen across the areas they're patrolling.

The thing Enshrouded does better than any other game of this genre is the RPG story elements.
A majority of the time in games like these the story takes a backseat to the gameplay, however, Enshrouded has a great storytelling foundation in place for an EA title, AND great gameplay to boot.

~Combat is reminiscent of Dark Souls Lite I suppose. You have some character classes like Tank, melee,mage, archer or a blend of some or all. Dodge,roll,damage ect. pretty basic but also very fun. spell effects look great, melee is okay but needs work, especially the 2-hand weapon combat which is so slow and sluggish it is almost entirely useless.

~The Base building system is IMO the best I have messed with out of any game in the genre. On par with or better than the detailed and customize-able nature of the Valheim building system. There is nearly no limitations to how you can build and I love that. wanna stack 60 foundations on top of each other? go for it! wanna make a custom shaped funky house or even a floating sky-palace? Go for it! I really hope they don't implement restrictions.

~Exploration is nice, there are tons of different POI's and cool nooks and crannies to explore. Use of the deadly shroud to inhibit lower level players from exploring beyond their abilities to me was a great choice rather than just an invisible wall or text saying you can't enter until so and so happens... Also the Shroud timer offers a sense of urgency in those areas. 

~graphics are beautiful, the devs took full advantage of their custom voxel engine to create insane vertical landscape differences.  The fact I can carve my way through a mountain or dig out my own hobbit hole or dwarven fortress is also very cool.

~I have encountered zero game breaking bugs myself. Mostly the bugs I have encountered have been enemies stuck in ground, walls, or other structures. Shields not coming up to block when the button is pressed with plenty of stamina every now and then( it almost seems like the game doesn't think you have a shield equipped and wont initiate a block sometimes). Very sluggish weapon changing or stopping during chain attacks where my character just stops in place mid attack. 

All in all I can reccomend this game for anyone who like this genre of game. you won't be dissapointed. From what the devs have shared it should only get better...hopefully, you never know what can happen though.",1708199030,1708199030,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Even then, you'll be pointless because the mage is killing everything before you can do anything. Melee characters can't hit flying enemies and get one-shot my magic, while the ranger couldn't make it because they were too busy grinding resources for arrows. When you hit the (current) endgame, there is nothing to do other than grinding for chests to get legendary weapons and top tier armor (which looks pretty shit). As I said, it needs a lot of work.

That said, the foundation is amazing. The skill tree has promise, the gameplay feels great, and the building system is the best I have ever tried (although grinding resources to build with is a nightmare). I played mage in a duo with a warrior, and while all he could really do was run around screaming, I had a really great experience. It took us about 60 hours to complete the current game, reach max lvl and get all achievements. We play very efficiently though, and at a leisurely pace you can easily spend over 80 hours in your first playthrough. The rest of my playtime is from just building castles, cottages and towers with the amazing building system.

I was lucky that I decided to play as a mage, but restarting to try melee and ranger showed me the greatest issue Enshrouded has; balance. If you want to play anything other than a mage you're probably not going to have a great time with this game.

Great potential. The skill points attribution gives a much wider style of game play than other survival games in that genre such as Valheim. The glider gives also a very fun and nice way to explore and access remote areas.

- side:
The building part is the biggest meh in my opinion. Far from what Valheim provides. The cinematic of cutting trees and plants could be much improved as well.

Much less grindy and more fun than Valheim... 

If you enjoy building all things in the world it's for you, due to un measurable amount of things to craft and build.
If you enjoy exploring the world it's kinda for you... Game can be explored really fast. 

Can get repetitive in enshrouded areas, due no much difference in exploration in harder level enshrouded zones.
Some biomes are lack luster of enemy variety and environment, feels empty.

If you like crafting survival games, this is for you. and really worth getting it. especially than more content comes up.

They really nailed the sweet spot between easy mode and painful repetition (aka great quality of life without making things overly easy).

Positives:
Looks good overall
Fantastic Exploration and terrain transversal.
Modifiable terrain.
Beautifully crafted world.
Excellent Crafting and Building
Nice mix of relaxing and challenging
Solid co-op, although shared questing is a bit of a drawback
Solo, Co-op, and online multiplayer options
Moveable warp points (flames) are WONDERFUL.
Free repairs.  No weight issues (only slots available cap).  They hit the perfect mix here.
Large volume craft queueing (vs. having to frequently load/unload items from kilns, forges, etc.).
Puzzles generally aren't overly easy or hard.
The Shroud is a great concept.

Negatives:
Lack of mob variety
Janky archery,  Melee can be brutal.  Seems to favor spellcasters.
Skill tree has a few mandatory items on it (like double jump).
Occasional bugs, which for me usually involved not being able to move (reloading game fixed)

This game has terrible crashes for alot of users, will you win the lottery or not? If not your stuck with constant crashing that will revert your progress and your world to whatever point it autosaved at, then your stuck doing the same thing over and over with the same result driving you to insanity. 

On another note, aside from progressing very little and in small increments each time between crashes, the game has a lack of development, many of the same character models are reused, and the areas, even though they seen nicely designed, are lacking in lore and interest with only a book or scroll somewhere inside giving a small random piece of story.

The balance of weapons is not very good, Wands being made completely broken in strength, and requiring no mana cost to use,  while bows have a problem with not only the skills being bugged and not working, but the extreme cost for munitions just to use them. There is an entire tree revolving around fire arrows, but to make fire arrows will cost you a lot of time and effort just to make a few, while staffs have equippable spells with unlimited charges.... 

the base building is fun but you cant unlock all your building pieces until you've essentially gone through the entire game, which then your left with nothing to do except base build as far as I understand it. I cant even base build the way I want because i cant progress fast or far due to constant crashing, god forbid i get the crashing WHILE im building. that is terrible too. 

I feel the game has good potential, if the devs make any attempt at balance, the bugs are corrected, and the crashing is fixed, but who knows if the devs priorities are in the right place. Even if in early access, I currently cannot recommend this game in its state.",1708180400,1708180400,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

TL DR: The game is fine because of the label ""Early Access"".

This is an EA game which by default excuses a lot of problems with a game. That being said, it is the ""most early access"" game I have ever played. What I mean by that is that this game is not finished. No, I do not mean that they released 4 biomes and have promised 4 more. I mean the now playable area is not finished. The game has some bugs (acceptable for EA), a TONE of placeholders (which underline the fact that it is an EA game a bit too much) and many many more problems.

The story is more than for example Valheim has but the replay ability since the world is not proceduraly generated is almost 0.

The Building system is awesome for someone that is creative, horrible for people who are not. The clipping is very bad, making you have to move your character in order to hit the exact spot you were aiming. If you build something with the smallest block, you have to tear it down the exact same way and there is no way to somehow ""freeze"" your base so you can no longer pick up stuff so that gets a bit annoying.
The worst thing about the building system is that NOTHING in this game makes you want to build a base. Your base doesn't get raided so no need for defenses, you can plant everything in any biom you like so no need for other bases and the only use for the flame altars is to have ""custom TP locations"" around the map.

The gameplay/classes. I have honestly played until the end a Melee class with the most points in HP and melee damage (CON and STR). After reaching the last areas I was wondering how hard it is for other classes since I was struggling. Long story short: The mage is unbalanced and is plowing through everything. the melee class has to get in harms way and does not have even remotely enough damage for that factor to matter. I mean the mage can block but usually everything is dead until you're in harms way...while the melee class is already there and relies on parry, block or dodge. I havent tried the ranged class but I assume it would fit right between these 2 classes.

I'm not going to talk about the bugs cause that is something they will probably fix but the placeholders are literally the worst thing you could have done IMO. You try to get up the highest mountain, have x debuffs until you get there but it doesn't matter...you see your target in the distance...then you reach it and it is literally a empty castle without even doors but you can see where the doors will be. That right there is something you should not have had in the game at all. I've watched the video they released showing how they made a mountain with a blade on top and a cave and so on. I honestly do not know why (if they are able to ""build their world"" so fast) they would add an empty castle anywhere and just ""airdrop"" it in. Not even the terrain around it is finished since the structure ""cuts"" into the terrain. This makes random exploring so unrewarding and honestly disappointing. Yes, it is an early access game but you could have left that mountain without the empty castle or made the debuff kill the player so they would not yet find out.

Gear and loot...uff...this is a big one and I would call it ""rewarding the player for the time invested in the game"". I absolutely hate the fact that not all gear can be crafted. There is an armor set you find through a quest chain but later on the non-craftable armor sets make you have to cheese the game and ""farm"" certain chests. It literally forces the player to grind an exploit instead of have him grind something like the resources and craft himself the armor (which would reward the player for actually staying in the game). Gear doesnt feel different from one level to the other. As mentioned, I played the melee class so armor was a big factor for me but as you get better gear, you get to fight the same opponents but higher level so...you're in the exact same spot as before. So nothing you do in that regards feels rewarding
Small spoiler I literally hate is the fact that a skilled player can legit have only his starting weapons and tools and beat the game. No resource is too hard for the first pickaxe you have...it just takes longer.

Yes, even though I only listed negative aspects this is a positive review because ""early access"" means they are working on it. The game has a lot of good mechanics in it and the sound is actually good. The last two points I wrote, the placeholders and the lack of rewards for the player for actually playing the game are the biggest problems of the game thus far. Story might be better but other games had less so... ;) ",1706117557,1708179348,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

To be honest i never played in better game before .Building is awesome and unique much better than in Conan Exiles, Valheim and others. Game still is on Early access so from RPG site about itemisations , upgrading and looting . 

What i love in this game :
- Building
- Many different type of materials to design you buildings.
- Passive Atlas tree
- Huge World 
- Many furniture items to creatine nice look your base.
- Very good Game and control of your character
- Great Flying 

What i would like to be added in this game:
- Upgrading system for Armor sets
- Skills by weapons
- More moneters becasue world is like empty.
- Bosses drop nearly nothing (Isn't point ot kill them again.
- More Mini bosses and caves could be great idea to make like a dungeons
- Gold Chest / Silver Chests is great idea but better if will be some bosses or minibosses to drop special items and special materials.

Absolutely LOVE the building system and all you can do with it, try messing around with the individual 1m blocks, not only with the main tiles, but also with the roof blocks too, they don't have to be used as only roof parts, that way you can create really interesting builds, game changer! I really like the combat as of right now too, sword & shield makes me feel like I'm playing a souls game which I love, the skill trees, the fact you can be whatever build you want and swap it whenever you want without much trouble, would be cool to see some improvements made to archery in general, but it's early access..

On the adventuring side some perks are broken and make the game a cakewalk, others are pretty much useless. Gear affixes and rarities don't matter, and mages dominate the fights. Healer's water aura makes consumable healing obsolete. Archers suffer the constant grind for materials to make arrows and melee is just hard with inconsistent damage uptime. Not sure why stealth exists. Armor is flat damage removal, so every enemy will either kill you in two hits or tickle you with rarely anything in-between. A well geared tank can take a nap in a spike trap surrounded by enemies while your party's damage focused archer will have to avoid every hit from any trash mob. The quests are repetitive, off the top of my head I can only remember 3 different quest types. Hope you like running to a point to find a note telling you which point you should run to next, ending in a boss fight against one of the three bosses the game has.

The building system is pretty nice, and maybe makes it worth the buy for you. It's a bit hard to put things down where you want them as they lock onto each other at impossible angles, but it's manageable. There isn't much else to do with the base after building it, unfortunately. You build it, put down decorations to get a rested buff, plop down NPCs wherever there's a roof, it doesn't really matter. Farming and cooking open up near the end of the game, but we never found much use for it. A bit of housekeeping will get you all the crafting crops you need. Some of the best consumable food is meat and berries, with meat constantly trying to kill you and berries laying around in your path so you'll be provided for just by playing the game outside the base. You can collect materials and craft gear, but very quickly you will find gear that is simply better because it's higher level. Crafting progression requires you to beat a high level area before getting the recipes for gear of that same level, so crafters will always be behind. While armor is still useful in keeping you alive, crafting weapons seems like a waste of time.

Worth noting that the game tries to not hold your hand in navigation, only giving you a mark on the map, but then designs quest areas that need to be approached from a very specific entrance or direction. Expect lots of running around or tunneling through walls to get to places. I haven't seen much in quest notes or NPC dialogue telling you where to go either after the first/second progression tier either, so not just a me not paying attention issue(probably).

On the technical side, game seems to be server authoritative, so it becomes unplayable with high ping, with teleporting monsters killing you without opportunity to react. We've had to buy a dedicated server, as playing through steam hosting would cause everyone but the host to desync really hard. Maybe this won't affect you though.

We've beat the game in 25 hours, just the main story, skill points, and getting good enough gear to overwhelm any fights.",1708166406,1708170111,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Here are some pros and cons after nearly 100 hours of game experience:
Pros:
- Performance is in most cases stable in private mode. No crash at all.
- Building system has been riveting if not truly optimized to a point where I would say flawless.
- Low stress. Game intensity is relatively lower than other survival counterparts where players have to deal with major threats constantly. Note: This could be a pro or a con depending on the player's attitude.
- Versatile attributes. Though in incomplete stage, there is clearly a vision of class diversity with their respective equipment sets.
- Day / Night shift. This is no longer an advantage any more in current era. However, it looks like the devs are trying to make certain events' intensity to vary during days and nights, which I believe is a point of potential. Just imaging if some monsters became strong during the night and weaker during the day. Or perhaps even a 'shroud evasion' during the night as shrouded areas enlarge and shrink.
Cons:
- Performance in most multiplayer servers were terrible. You could experience heavy lag and constant repositioning due to front-back discrepancy.
- Class features are less significant. e.g. Tankers' survivability feels somewhat limited against bosses even after maxing out attributes and equipment.
- Ground vs. air. This issue becomes more noticeable when you plays melee classes. Without good positioning most of your attacks could miss while taking considerable damage. Personally I even encountered an awkward situation where boss loot fell into a large lava area. lol
- Some bugs. Tolerable since it is still being worked on. e.g. opened gates can still block ranged attacks; as long as roles have duplicated position with terrains they are not considered 'dead'. etc.
- Crafting timer. One of the most commonly mentioned in communities. Late game offers extremely long crafting timers and you HAVE to consume real game time only to wait or find something else which is not yet available or won't be that way at all.
- Less challenging. As I have mentioned, this could vary based on your opinion towards 'Survival'. There is not enough sense of oppression to push players to struggle for their survival in vast open heath. So if you happen to be a real hardcore survivalist looking for challenge, you will be disappointed.

After some exploration I found the devs are willing to listen to feedbacks from their audience (or at least it appeared to be so) and I believe this is a very nice point to start with. Your willingness to make adjustments according to the voice of players are the essence of product potential. Best wishes to everyone and this product. Enjoy your days.

This is a good game. If you like this genre it is worth your $40 cdn. Highly recommend.

Couple of notes though:
1. The AI is dumb. You can easily defeat enemies with very little skill. Terrain baffles the mobs and they become running idiots.
2. The combat move set is generic. If you are expecting a souls like experience you will be disappointed. It seems more align with Breath of the Wild or Valheim. 
3. The game needs some quality of life additions like stack items in nearby chests commands, tick marks on the map to mark off where you have been, and a method to tell the time of day.

I eagerly await what is next on the horizon for this game. I did go through it single player and have completed all quests available.

Took me quite a while to get to the current ""end-game"" and afterwards I've spent a considerable amount of time on building unique buildings which has ... just consumed a ton of time with the game. Love me some building and this one allows for you to build huge complexes into the sides of mountains and inside of caves to a degree that Valheim just couldn't provide and I fuckin' love it.

I'm not comparing the games either. While, I guess similar, they're vastly different with Enshrouded being a few steps above Valheim on my game meter or whatever you want to call it. The graphics are better, the world feels vastly more fleshed out and the building is fuckin' top tier (also hopeful there are some more QOL things added to it but for now it's great). Since they're claiming that this is a little over a quarter complete, I'm already yearning for more as I've mostly run out of things to do other than build and farm at this point. However, I'm definitely okay with that.

* Skill tree contains boring passive effects.
* Magic requires ammo which you cannot acquire early in the game. Or you use wand basic attacks which are slow, short range and animation lock you.
* Map lags heavily when even slightly zoomed out.
* Game immediately sends you to face level 3 enemies as a level 2. In most games that sounds pretty ok but in this game you get 2 shot by enemies with this level gap and die almost immediately. Also sometimes their name plates won't show up until you're dead so you don't even know what level they are.
* Overuse of fog gives me a headache. Even outside the shroud everything is foggy and blurry.
* Have to pick up resources you mine/chop. Not where I would have drawn the line between fun and realism.
* Menus are bad. You can see this right off the bat when you press Start Game, make a character, press Start Game, select your save slot and then select your world, press Start Game. What the fuck? Even software developers with no UI design experience shouldn't get this wrong.
* Information is not clearly available and it's often unclear what an item will do before you use it.
* Visually disgusting. LODing also isn't optimised so anything that's kinda far but still visible looks like dogshit.
* Crafting system is not intuitive and does not hide items you already have. E.g. why list an Axe if I already have one and can use it forever?
* Overuses the action bar/hotbar causing it to take a while to switch between items since you have to usually use Alt to toggle pages and then a button to switch. Bit too confusing to navigate. Why not clean up the inventory UI and then let us eat from there?
* ""I"" doesn't open inventory. ""K"" doesn't open skills. Please for the love of god it's not hard to follow industry conventions.
* Stamina system is not fun. Firstly, to cut a tree down you either need to use more than your stamina bar or you need to have rested bonus. Then it takes all your stamina to cut a single tree down. There's a delay to stamina recharge even if you don't deplete your bar, actively punishing you for using your stamina in short bursts.
* Looting seems to involve a lot of smashing everything you see and collecting things off the ground after.
* Books have very little value and are more shallow than lore books usually are.
* Can't help comparing to Palworld and being thoroughly unimpressed with this game.

Pros:
I'll just include the stuff that ""surprised"" me since it's not a terrible game.
* Cooking system was pretty nice. Could get boring after a while?
* Shroud having different materials is nice I suppose. Minecraft has that too with the nether and that doesn't have a big fat arbitrary, artificial timer over your head telling you to leave.",1708128884,1708128884,False,1,0,0.481428563594818115,0,True,False,True

In a nutshell, this game reminds me of Valheim, just with an evil mushroom fog. And that's kinda dope, being honest. I'm looking forward a lot to future updates, as I've just about finished the content available in early access, with some exceptions. Compared to other survival-crafts, Enshrouded differentiates itself with making Exploration a core part of its gameplay. It has a static crafted world. This leaves room for a crafted experience, allowing world and area design to guide you to different objectives and points of interest. Other main aspects of the game include combat and base building. I'll break down each section below into greater detail for my thoughts on them.

Exploration // Overall, the exploration in Enshrouded is probably what kept me most engaged with the game. Without it, I probably wouldn't find much that'd make me play it over something like Valheim. Just by following the quests from the NPCs, and generally pushing forward into the unknown to see what else was around, I found myself naturally discovering points of interest, new materials, and more to explore. Some of my favorite parts of the game were the fast travel towers, where unlocking them requires completing a series of three platforming trials/puzzles. These were pretty engaging for me, utilizing the grappling hook, climbing walls, traps to evade, and so on. I genuinely enjoyed each one, and looked forward to the next tower to complete them. There are also a handful of temples/catabombs/etc which feature similar situations. Again, these were often quite fun for me. I think this could be an issue if I were playing multiplayer, and others were rushing through them, but my exclusively solo playthrough didn't run into that issue. Lastly, there were a few points in the game where I had an area I very clearly needed to progress to, but I hadn't explored the map fully, so I had to look to see what looked like the best way there. For me, this was fun, planning my route and exploring to find the path is fun for me, but players who get easily lost or hate exploring likely won't have as much fun, so that's a bit of YMMV.

Combat // It's hard to say how enjoyable the combat is for me compared to other games. Enemies can get pretty tanky, so I've found I often need to utilize terrain and landscape to my advantage when facing multiple enemies, and to utilize pretty explicit cheese when fighting some bosses. Combat suffered most from me playing solo, and likely will be a pain point for other solo players. I eventually found my style in hiding behind a shield while peppering my enemies with a wand, keeping multiple wands in my inventory for elemental rock-paper-scissors. I could see a ranger-style character, or an unoptimized melee build running into trouble; but I can't be certain since I didn't go down either of those paths. However, if you play the game in multiplayer, then you get the flip side of this coin. While I haven't played multiplayer myself, having watched a bit of it played, the ability for different players to specialize in different roles looks to be incredibly fun. I also imagine that every enemy I had a hard time with would be immeasurably easier with even a single second player that had a complimentary combat build to mine. Being able to put that kind of thought and planning into party composition and character building can be quite enjoyable, and there's definitely multiple viable character builds if you're playing with others. The variety of gear you can craft can help you really nail down what you want too. Single players I'd give a soft 'eh', YMMV and it'll be tough, especially with certain enemies ([spoiler]hecc the sicklescythe and acid cleaver scavenger[/spoiler])

Building+Crafting // Finally, the third pillar of the game is your base building and crafting part of the survival craft. Being honest, I didn't engage with this nearly as much as I would have liked, my base ended up being a single somewhat nice house, with a platform with all my crafting stations, and my NPCs inside. Some sparse decorations according to my tastes (love me some fireplaces), and an organized storage room underneath (filled with magic chests so that the materials inside are always accessible for crafting within the base), left me more or less satisfied. That said, there are a number of pretty building blocks you can unlock, and if you take your time with it, you can build some incredibly pretty things. I look forward to when I have the energy/inspiration/motivation to prettify my base, because I think it'll be pretty great. Material hunting wasn't to bad overall. It's aided by the fact you can fast travel any time you aren't in the shroud, but getting back into the world can be a bit more difficult. I ended up using one flame altar for my main base, while the rest I utilized like movable fast travel points. I'd often set one up in a nice central location in a new region, so that I could easily return their after an expedition. There was only one time I had to look up where to find a specific material, every other time I had naturally run into it just while exploring and keeping my eyes open. Don't be afraid to look it up if you don't feel like searching and don't enjoy exploration as much as I do though. The number of recipes is pretty extensive, and I'd say that one of the better parts is that you have a large variety of armor types to choose from. With something like eight-ish sets for every primary archetype (melee, ranged, magic), and five pieces per set, you have a lot of mix and match options. This means you can probably tailor your bonuses to exactly what you want or need. Weapons are a bit more of a pain though, although you can craft weapons, the weapons you find in the wild are going to be much better. First off, they're upgradable, You spend runs at any craftperson to enhance it and add some sub-effect. Second, they come in rarities, the typical common-uncommon-rare-epic-legendary scale. The higher the rarity, the more times you can upgrade it. Weapons you don't care for can be salvaged for more runs. It's a pretty decent system, but if you're hunting for the perfect weapon, it'd definitely take a while. Lastly in this section, let's talk about tool durability. You can easily repair all your tools at a workbench, and occasionally, anvils you find while exploring. You can only place workbenches at your altars, so it's a good idea to set them up so you can repair any time you use one as a fast travel beacon. However, if you use all the durability of any tool (that isn't a torch), you still keep the tool, and it'll repair to full the next time you use a bench. Honestly, it feels a little unnecessary. I'm grateful that repairing doesn't cost any sort of material (Valheim has spoiled me, I'm not sure I can play a survival-craft with durability that requires items to repair anymore), but it doesn't really add much to have to go back and repair. Normally your inventory will force you back to base anyways.

Compared to other survival-crafts, death is pretty forgiving. YMMV on if you like that, but for me it's rather a fresh reprieve. In things like valheim, I'm often exhausted whenever I die and have to go on a death run to recover my equipment. Keeping your equipment and consumables, and dropping materials seems like a pretty good compromise. Additionally, there are a number of respawn points around the world, and often at the entrance of various dungeons filled with enemies, so your death run isn't painful and long. This does mean at times I beat things by bashing my head at it until I got it, but at least I didn't feel like I was losing valuable time and experience with every death. Enshrouded is forgiving with its death, and I'm thankful for that.

Updated
Things that need to change before Early Access Ends
- Need a way to communicate in game (Text and/or Character Emotes)
- Need to be able to interact with furniture, on a most basic level I would like to sit in a a chair.
- The armor system is a little meh.  You are stuck mostly with whatever level armor of your build for large amounts of time.  It would be nice to have some cosmetic options from color to design to make you stand apart.
- Quest system needs overhaul ( though it seems it is getting worked on)
- NPC's need to be able to be at any settlement (Seems this may be being worked on as well)
- Weapon wear and tear needs to be adjusted.  Weapons wear down far too fast.  Either you have to cut your adventuring short (which is why we are here right?) or carry multiple weapons with you (either a clone of your weapon or some other weapon you may not like or be specced in).  I don't mind if it costs resources to repair, but the current rate of weapon wear is more annoying and makes the game a little less enjoyable (Note : In general, I am against item degradation systems as they serve no purpose unless you are trying specifically to curb player time or as a resource sink - neither is fun).",1706116760,1708120438,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Soullike, with the challenge, but crappy combat and glitchy
Valheim like, without the boats, slightly more interesting combat but without the atmosphere
A builder, but with a lot of material gathering and with less automation
A gatherer, where you have to go far and wide in unknown territory to gather unknown materials
An explorer, where you're not sure what you're exploring. Books I guess?
A story driven world, where the story is ""mostly mushrooms""
Zelda without the puzzles
Minecraft without... well Minecraft
Skyrim with friends?

Combat is only okay. I hope this area will see a lot of improvement during the course of Early Access. It's serviceable, but the keybinds for things like selecting spells and the general feel of combat animations and flow needs a lot of work.

The world is gorgeous and the draw distance is remarkable. I am very impressed by the custom engine Keen have built for Enshrouded.

Exploration is fun. I especially like the little touch of hidden lore bits throughout the world unlocking nearby points of interest rather than POIs simply being something that get revealed when the player is nearby. It makes exploring the world feel much less like a giant checklist.

Quests and story are a bit underwhelming, but I also don't expect much in this area from a sandbox survival game like Enshrouded.

The puzzles are all far too simplistic and repetitive IMO, consisting mostly of the same few traps over and over while trying to find buttons required to open doors. I am hoping dungeon crawls will also see a lot of improvement as EA progresses.

All in all I am having a fantastic time.

Some of the issues I have: melee is under-cooked and routinely feels broken, especially compared to throwing a fireball. The jumping and climbing mechanics are average. Digging your way up a mountain, to get to areas that you aren't able to climb to, is tedious and annoying.

[b]Issues with Inspiration[/b]
This game feels like it was created by a very competent fifteen year old who played Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild. I have no problem with games that draw inspiration from other titles, but it feels weird having the game feel of...something else in a false skin of these two games. Enshrouded really does draw heavy inspiration from Elden Ring. The first experience you'll get is a narrated ""souls-like"" trailer that - if you have a brief knowledge of Elden Ring - sounds like the Elden Ring opening cinematic voiced by Ranni. You pop out of this cinematic into the Cinderforge or some shit. The ambient music of Elder Scrolls V plays in the background (which is pretty kino). Then, they tell me I am the flameborn. Little known fact about me: I told my friend that if the character is called the Sandborn in Elder Scrolls VI I am going to unload an entire magazine into my computer. Very nearly had a report of shots fired in my county yesterday.

[b]Difficulty[/b]
This game does not seem difficult at all. You can zip away from danger on a plethora of movement assist items. The enemies are not difficult in the slightest. I expect that as I progress into the game this may change, but I doubt the developers made it so there's a point to building. I'd love it if I had an actual reason to build besides just building grand fortresses. I say this because I am the only person who will sit there for three hundred hours and build while my friends would rather go smash something. The game also provides a lot of assistance with quests - an industry standard over the last ten years - but I personally find this insulting. I'm not a toddler I don't need clairvoyance holding my wang 24/7 with giant pillars of light. 

[b]The good[/b]
The timer of how long you can stay in the shroud is a nice mechanic. Rather than having it eat away at your health I rather like that. It reminds me of Subnautica's/Deep Rock Galactic's Low O2 breath timer in a way. The level design is also really good even if everything they ever made feels like Elden Ring. Structures are simplistic, yet complicated and developers put some thought into things. The convoluted nature of period-accurate castles can felt by what they set up. I just wish the hidden doors wouldn't treat me like an iPad baby by glowing like a federal agent. Not sure if this changes out of the first level but I hope so! 
The building systems itself are also very impressive. Really blew ARK's developers out of the water and that's why I'm not giving the game a negative review. You can tell they understand the space requirements of a structure in a third person game when you watch how they use the building system.

[b]Personal Gripes[/b]
Third person is a no-no for me and I'd rather play an ASCII game. I understand for most people this is not an issue, but I detest third person. The developers said they have no plans to aid modders by creating development tools. Doubt I'll be seeing a first person mod any time in the next four years. The game is also full of zoomer movement items like hang gliders and grappling hooks. Not the end of the world but you can really tell I am not the market they're trying to appeal to here with the BotW UI among other things. Why does every modern game have this weird visual feel to it where it's halfway to cartoony fortnite graphics? It just feels uncanny and I don't like it.

[b]Expectations[/b]
I'll be very clear. I expect modding tool to be added. This game is not original enough nor does it have enough content to survive a decade without these tools. The building system is a fantastic draw for me. I really hope you give a purpose to me building. Base sieges would be nice. Designate a personal home versus fortress. Get rewards from fending off enemies at your fortress while homes are left alone. Etc~ Don't care but I want it. 
Conan Exiles is a great example of a game that let you build pretty amazing castles, but every other feature fell flat on its face so hard that I left a negative review. The guards I put on the castle would just flat out ignore people trespassing in my territory because I was offline. There was no challenge and that's what bored me to death.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
This is not a game that needs PvP to survive, but it does need new PvE content related to bringing the threat to the players or this game will bore anyone to tears if they have a mild amount of competency. Take some mechanics from base defense games next please. Enshrouded is a cut above other survival titles as it does not draw inspiration solely from other survival games. In a stagnant market where nothing novel has been released in three years - that is great .I do, however, feel like I'm playing Fortnite Yung Rang meant for a generation without critical thinking. The level design, level visuals, and building/voxel systems are incredible. Hats off.",1708099170,1708111341,True,0,0,0.39682537317276001,0,True,False,True

Now, into the details. When I first saw Enshrouded, I got the same Valheim and V Rising vibes that I assume most people ran into. As a longtime player of Rust and an RPG lover, I liked those games. Thing is, I got bored with both of them in about a day.

That disappointment left a hole in my heart, aching for an open world building game in a fantasy setting. Then Enshrouded popped up, and it is basically everything I could have asked for.

What I Like:

The beautiful world. It looks great, and it seems pretty damn big. If the fog-of-war on the map is to be believed, I’ve been playing quite a bit since launch, and I’ve only uncovered maybe ten percent of it. Different environs are promised, and just as I was getting bored with the woodland area, I found myself being sent into a rainforest for higher-level quests. From the top of a huge tower, I can see a cool-looking desert biome, though I haven’t found my way over there yet.

Quests. These keep things interesting and guide my exploration. Handed out by NPCs I’ve rescued, they’re largely responsible for locking new blueprints and recipes.

Construction. The main reason I’m into these games in the first place. Building is easy, and the variety of shapes makes it possible to build damn near anything. I love that overlapping blocks automatically “merge” to create optimal transitions between two materials or to remove seams. Even the gardening part of the game is fascinating, and I’ve found myself spending hours just building up and populating the garden outside of my home.

Build locations. I love that I can set up my bases inside existing towns or caves. My first “real” base took shape inside an abandoned farm with multiple barns. Over time, I was able to repair the broken buildings and take over, giving me a sizable base with a lot of space — without needing to build it from scratch.

Setting. The eco-horror aspect feels fresh and unique. 


What I Would Change:

Enemy variety. Unfortunately, I haven’t run into a huge variety of mobs. Wolves, scavengers, and a couple of different mutants in the Shroud zones, for the most part. That said, I’ve run into and killed at least four different boss types so far, including one that required me to change my playstyle completely just to survive. 

Theme. I’m getting a little tired of the “grimdark” takeover in fantasy. While Enshrouded’s setting and lore is cool, I long for the days when fantasy games had you fighting something other than mutants, skeletons, and zombies. What about good-old bandits? Orcs? Things that aren’t undead? Maybe some non-grimdark stuff lies ahead, so I can’t fault the game yet. But so far, it’s all been fairly dark. And grim. 

All told, if you like building things, and you like fantasy settings, this is a surefire win.",1708110912,1708110912,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The character creation is very straightforward and it is very easy to switch roles, providing you have saved appropriate gear to perform other duties. I have developed both a Ranger/Fighter and pure Mage. There are also Healer and Tank types as well as any Hybrid in between. For me, the games lacks a definitive direction. I require a game with more guidance as I easily become overwhelmed by a wide-open experience resulting in too many choices. Some people thrive with the freedom, I just simply do not. The multi-player experience is where this game can excel. I have rolled two characters. Neither requires their own unique game save. I can bring/take items and resources into/from any game I enter, whether in between my own, private saves or my friend's saves. When I choose to use my save as a multiplayer, my single player save progresses along with it. When other players play in my sandbox, they can run independently or with me accomplishing various tasks. You are able to open up to 16 other players to join you. You set the number. You can also join other, open servers hosted by other players. I have kept mine private.

I feel this game is pretty well polished at this point. I wish there were more aid in the pathing required to accomplish certain quests (ie. Light the way through the mountain walls, etc.) . Moving around in the world can be somewhat daunting and time consuming, and can also easily become deadly. I wish there was a game clock for reference to how much time remains in the day. The fast travel system is excellent as long as you strategically place or remove your campsites as you progress. I like the way you can control where they are located.

Overall, I think this is a pretty good game.",1708108048,1708108048,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Some things are truly great. The art department is stellar. The game is lush and gorgeous. KEEN Games is using their own code and it shows in the lighting, which blows away anything Unity ever put out. Models are realistic (things like flax look like flax) and imaginative ( like imaginary Shroud flora). The art team needs to take a victory lap.

Same for the SFX crew. When that baddie growls in my left ear, it's because the baddie is to my left. And little details like mining sounds...clay is satisfyingly thuddy AND squishy sounding. Then you realize you've dug pretty deep because a reverb has kicked in to make it sound undergroundy.  Brilliant stuff. I could go on and on about the SFX.

The world feels immersive from the first step. There is so much to do, and each aspect is well executed. Exploration, combat, puzzle mazes, storylines, and of course building. So many textures to choose from and they all render beautifully. Coupled with the amazing lighting and fully deformable terrain and folks are building some really lovely places. If I had more talent, I would too. 

With all that in mind, if you are looking for a good way to burn $30 or so, this may be it. If you like these sorts of games, you can do a LOT worse than Enshrouded. Most of my Steam reviews are negative because I would not recommend them to a friend for whatever reasons. 

I would recommend Enshrouded.

But no review is complete without pointing out what kept this potential 9.7 game all the way back to a 7. I'm a rough reviewer. A 7 is a VERY respectable score for three weeks into early access. And in light of the overall excellence I don't doubt that the team has the talent and passion to get it ironed out. But as of now there are a few details that need ironing. For instance- a pause button in single player. 

The Devs have a vision, and apparently it's that they want to make a multiplayer game. And that's okay, except that a large percentage of folks prefer to play solo, myself included. (I'm lying, I have no friends. Solo is my only option). Obviously in multiplayer a pause button won't work, but in single player it's a must. And it's so simple to implement that it's conspicuous in its absence. I don't want to harp on those kind of details. I believe that will be fixed as the Devs are pretty active on the discussion boards and are listening to the suggestions page, even if they are not planning to implement every suggestion. They ARE listening. And that is very encouraging.

But my MAIN gripe with this game is the Shroud itself. It's a great concept for a game mechanic and plot driver. Love the idea. But the execution runs into problems with the Dev's vision to keep the game multiplayer focused. In the game, you are Flameborn. A mysterious humanoid, come to eliminate the Shroud and save the world. Sounds good.

But you can not, in fact, eliminate the Shroud. In Multiplayer it's because they want everyone to be able to complete every quest and kill every boss, so it all resets every 30 minutes. This carries into single player. Nothing you do actually matters. You were brought into the world by mysterious forces explicitly to save it from the Shroud, but you can't. There is no game mechanic that allows you to do so.

And because it's their own code, there will be minimal modding to customize the game to individual players preferences.

But the Shroud areas of the map are not fun either. The timer and lack of visibility make them stressful. I was avoiding them completely, but the game hard gates itself behind Shroud repeatedly. Thankfully someone told me about an app that allows you turn off the Shroud timer. That eliminated a lot of the stress, but I still can;t see a darned thing, and that's a no. It's a video game. Video. From the Latin 'Vizier', meaning 'to see'. Sure make it a bit foggy, its the Shroud, but at times you can't even see your feet. Visibility is less than 5 feet. That's an entire letter grade off. Stop doing that. When I want an audio game I play my guitar.

Thankfully, the lack of structural integrity means you can just build a staircase and bridge over any deadly Shroud you want to avoid. It fails as a gating mechanism too.

All in all the Shroud is the part of Enshrouded that needs the most work. I've thoroughly enjoyed everything that was not Shroud. But the timer is a hard no. And not being able to actually rid the world of Shroud is a hard no. 

Yes, the game is still fun and for $30 it's a buy and a solid 7. But with some effort it could attain a 9.5 or better. Here's hoping whoever is making the weird decisions down there swallows their pride and lets the modders have a go. I'd hate to see another ore/ portal debacle keep this game from attaining more potential. Because I'm enjoying the heck out of it and want it to catch on and keep growing. Except for the Shroud. I want to destroy that and save the world.

Enshrouded strikes a perfect balance of casual exploration, building and challenge, I rate it as a 8-9/10 as-is.

Now if you're one of the thousands of unemployed gamer influencer content creator streamer types it'll likely not suite your (life)style. I can almost hear them complaining that the loot is too easy to farm. The content is too easy to bypass etc... Already loads of comments about wanting devs to nerf this or that to make the game ""harder"". wtf??

I mean if I had all the time in the world then maybe I'd demand changes that make everything nearly impossible sans for the 1%'ers with no earthly obligations outside of gaming. 

So... if the devs can leave things as-is and perhaps add to it in places, this is a perfect game for casuals. If instead they go the way of WoW, DayZ and many others to cater to those with no jobs or life obligations (kids and family) then I'll come back and change this to a 1/10 review and delete this game from my library. 

Examples of how to ruin this game. Add more gate keepers in areas where current chest farming happens. It's fun to farm loot. It's a challenge to get to those areas as a lowbie, I don't care if it's only a day or two of fun. It's still all I had to spend (waste) on a new game. The building function to aide in this is awesome and I wouldn't change it. 

Things I'd like to see added, pets would be cool. Just fun little companions then maybe hunter pets but really just want to be able to collect little critters like I did in WoW while that was still fun. Pet battles anyone?? 

Also, I want to be able to see my toons head/face. The armor is cool and the initial sets look great. But I don't need to see the helm 100% of the time I play. Maybe there is a disable function I missed?

Mining is really cool. I think you should be able to tunnel under the shroud. The time/effort that would take should offset the ""cheaty'ness"" of it, if you're the type to look at it that way (the same ones whining about building stairs above the shroud to glide into places). Maybe add some dungeons you have to tunnel to get to?? Where my tunnel rats at?? 

tl;dr - End of the day, if I only have 12-24 hours of (highly) divided time on the weekend to play, keep it simple stupid, this also makes it fun as I can play this drunk  with the wifey or friends and still not suck too bad).

The ability to build with small cubes that have continuous textures allows for a lot of creative freedom that you could maybe see in Minecraft with the chisels and bits mod, however Enshrouded's smallest unit is not as tiny making it easier to work with even if it does not allow you to make things like custom pottery or smaller.

The game also does voxel mining very well, better than I can remember from any other game. The most obvious comparison would be Valheim, though Enshrouded's terraforming is a lot easier to manage. You can dig manually with a pickaxe and mold caves how you want, or you can place chunks of a building material in the wall and remove it, deleting the stone/dirt that was there to create perfectly squared rooms.

The open world is huge and is filled with loot, enemies and abandoned structures, the double jump skill in this game alone makes it a joy to use when climbing, escaping or parkour on the buildings. 

The build mode is fun but needs work, everything is locked to a 90 degree angle and sometimes blocks won't connect or mesh together. On the plus side there is tons of useful furniture and work stations to craft each with a purpose. The Blacksmith sucks he does not offer appealing weapons to craft but his craft able armor options ain't half bad. 

Combat is the biggest issue of this game don't expect DS or ER quality combat mechanics and the AI is sometimes dumber than dirt and boss battles are easy to cheese with a range weapons. The lock on mechanic is iffy, you lock on to an enemy only for your character to turn his/her back on the enemy and getting slammed from behind.  

The story aspect is meh I don't really play this game for the story and it's not that engaging either, there is plenty of lore books laying around for you to read and some survivors of the old world for you to rescue/find.

You don't have to build a base, you don't have to rescue anyone, you can level up to 15 just by killing mobs at the starting area, then find a golden chest and farm it until you get the most powerful items on the game.

There is no sense of progression or purpose, why i am killing this boss, why i am moving to more difficult areas, why i am spending hours to save those npc's and then farm for hours to craft items weaker than random chest drops, why i am building a base other than aesthetic value? (i did all that anyway and explored EVERYTHING)

Yes it is early access but that's not an excuse, i played Valheim in early access and even with problems games core was there, you need to kill first boss to summon next one or move to another area so you can get certain items from certain dungeon, you need to kill certain mobs to get the key for that dungeon etc.

The multiplayer experience feels like the game was meant to be single player and they added multiplayer just so people could play together. Enemies are not  hard enough for a tank/healer and dps. There should be world bosses that require a group.

 There should be two options for gear for two play styles. Base building/farming/mining and creating your own gear or obtaining it in the world and farming bosses. Not logging off and back in at a gold chest. You should be forced to play the game for the best gear not easily obtain it and have no reason to play.

- Wand targetting is awful. The settings dont work and its a nightmare to play wand against a group of enemies. Please fix this
- The game becomes repetitive at some point. When you have explored all biomes, you will encounter the same mob... just at a higher level

Enshrouded is a very great game for being early access. It did not take me long to really enjoy it.

Pros:
-MASSIVE world. Quite a bit to explore with a lot of freedom to explore. (no invisible walls)
-Comprehensive crafting, for anyone that likes crafting various tools and objects.
-Very, very interesting and fun building capability. The amount of blocks you are offered with the types of objects and structures you can build opens up for highly customizable bases, homes, and structures.
-The story is interesting. You pick up on the lore in the fashion of pieces of story left behind in the world. No spoilers here though, go out and find it!
-Large skill trees with tons of options to customize your character to function in your personal way.
-The shroud system offers challenge in limited time for dangerous areas. (with options to extend that time)

Cons:
-PLEASE put the glider on a different keybind or let us move what key glide is bound to. It shares the space bar with double jump and this has led to A LOT of misadventures in my gameplay where I want to double jump but sometimes wind up gliding or vice versa.
-Hills and slopes are very slippery and slidey. This is painfully apparent when attempting to mine out a tunnel at an angle. It becomes very difficult to walk up what looks like would be a reasonable slope but your character slides back down.
-Character archetypes (warrior, wizard, ranger, etc.) eventually boils down to caster is best class unless you use explosive arrows on ranger. Warrior is unfortunately very lacking in damage output compared to the other two and its tankiness seems to be irrelevant in end-game areas even with full tank skills taken and end-game armor. TL;DR - please give melee builds some love
-Flying enemies are a bit of a nightmare to deal with. Draconian Vultures hit like trucks. Sicklescythes and the other flying shroud enemy variant are literally impossible to hit with melee weapons as they consistently stay vertically out of reach. I would only ask these get looked at under a microscope for melee players but they do emphasize ""hey, you should probably have ranged combat available on your character.""
-Flax, Linen, Fabric, Padding. Once you get to the point of the game where you need Padding to make some gear, you'll quickly realize you need a mess ton of Flax. As far as I have found barring easy to gather materials like Wood Logs, Stone, and Twigs, no other resource in the game emphasizes such huge requirements for gathering in terms of sheer amount needed. (the spinning wheel station does reduce the pain a little bit)

All in all, I personally give this game a 9 out of 10. For being early access, it is very thoroughly well put together and fun. Solo play is possible, multiplayer play is very fun with friends. Truthfully, I felt like this game was worth $40 and not $30.

I sincerely cannot wait to see what more comes to the game. I'm hoping for a snow biome! I love snowy areas. When Enshrouded comes out of early access and more content becomes available, you better believe I'm here for it.",1708074721,1708074721,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Pros:
- Decent graphics
- Base building, tons of construction materials options for foundations and walls.
- Can store large quantities of construction materials at once on your character without a weight penalty
- Wind Glider mechanic is cool.

Neutral:
- World is large and a ton to explore.. but, not all points of interest have a path to get to them unless you dig you way through mountains to get to them. Find it very tedious to run along a whole mountain side to find that there isn't a path up to a shrine. Have to dig a hole all the way up to get to it.
- Puzzle towers are meh. More of a cheap zelda tower climb.
- Character skill trees are pretty boring, but adds some kind of customization.

Cons:
- Combat is simple and boring
- LONG.. I mean LONG time to level up.
- Durability is wonky in this game, literally have to bring multiple weapons and pick axes during each expedition. 
- Missions go from easy to sending you super far off locations where the monsters are way higher level. The progression is off, it's not a flowing state of moving forward, but large spikes in difficulty.

Overall, I wanted to like it. Has potential to be a fresh survival game, but the mechanics hold it back! Just tedious to get to locations and constantly having to back track to repair items is what killed it for me.

There are some valid complaints but most of the complaints I see are people who aren't experienced enough or don't understand the gameplay loop. Heres just a few I've seen:

1. I can't parry anything! They must be bugged!
I've had times where I don't miss a parry at all, I thought this comment was true until I got used to the parry windows then they get semi-easy to do reliably. I have only seen once or twice when a parry should have gone through and didn't.
2. This game is so grindy!
I'm not going to disagree that there is grind, but compared to other survival games like rust or minecraft its nowhere near as grindy. I might spend 20-30 minutes mining flint or copper and I'll be good for a good while.
3. The workbenches take SOOOOO long to craft!
Yes, go do something else while its crafting, have your wells on and off base reset? Did you check any high value chests? Have you killed any previous bosses for special loot? Did you collect any more food? What about seeing what that black smudge on your map is hiding? No? you spent the last hour on youtube waiting for tomato seeds to craft? You're doing it wrong.
4. It takes SOOO long to get to where I need to be! Why bother?
Collect 5 stone, craft altar, place altar, press E. You can now teleport there from ANYWHERE on the map in SECONDS.
5. Shroud timer is too short! how can I get anything done?
Upgrade your altar, drink a potion, or just watch the clock and use your time more efficiently.

If you have none of those issues and still find it boring fair enough, but please give this game another chance or look at it from another angle. This is THE BEST purchase I have made in the past year or so and the fact its multiplayer makes it so much better. I have spent the past year trying to mod minecraft to get an experience close to this. This just scratches every itch I had with survival rpg games in the form of a pretty well polished game.

We love RPGs, immersive worlds and lore like what you would see in BG3 or Skyrim. I've played bits of mine craft and bits of Valheim, but not enough to justify my love for the genre. So when it comes to survival games, we are un-knowledgeable and intimidated by them. 

However, Enshrouded is just different so far. Its not tedious, in-fact its pacing is exactly what we want out of a game, especially playing coop with two different skill levels.  The world is THE most immersive we have seen out of recent games, and rivals that of skyrim. The Combat is simple but doesn't get stale . RPG elements are a huge surprise ( skill trees, epic drops). And the Building is the best part of the game in our opinion.

To put that in perspective, that is 4 major aspects of a survival RPG that are just amazing. We are both about 20 hours into this game and its been stellar. Oh did i mention this game is early access. There are issues (minor) that can be fixed, but have no chance of ruining this amazing experience. Oh yeah, Also...  its less than half the price of AAA titles that don't have half the heart. 

Pick this up if you are new or a vet of the survival Genre. Its an example of what a great game should be.

Enshrouded, the new co-op survival RPG from Keen Games, has arrived, and it's a breath of fresh air in the genre. From its engaging narrative to its intuitive mechanics, the game offers a compelling experience that's both fun and challenging.

A World on Fire:

The story throws you right into the thick of things, casting you as the last of the Flameborn - tasked with saving the realm of Embervale from a corrupting fog. The narrative unfolds organically through exploration and discovery, with just the right amount of intrigue to keep you invested. It's not the deepest story ever told, but it serves its purpose well, providing a backdrop for the exciting gameplay.

Pacing Perfection:

One of Enshrouded's biggest strengths is its pacing. The game throws new challenges and mechanics at you steadily, but never overwhelms. You'll constantly be unlocking new abilities, crafting gear, and progressing through the world, ensuring a satisfying sense of accomplishment throughout your journey. Whether you're tackling a challenging boss or simply exploring a hidden corner, there's always something to keep you engaged.

Scaling the Heights:

The world of Embervale is vast and diverse, offering a variety of biomes to explore, each with its own unique dangers and rewards. The world feels truly alive, thanks to the dynamic weather system and the ever-present threat of the encroaching fog. Additionally, the game's ""scaling"" system is commendable. Whether you're playing solo or with a group of friends, the difficulty adjusts seamlessly, ensuring a balanced experience for everyone.

Beyond the Flames:

However, it's worth noting that Enshrouded is still in Early Access, and there are some aspects that could be improved. The endgame content feels a bit sparse at the moment, and there are occasional technical hiccups. Nevertheless, the developers are actively working on updates and improvements, and the potential for this game is undeniable.

Verdict:

If you're looking for a fun, engaging, and well-paced survival RPG with a vibrant world and satisfying gameplay loop, then Enshrouded is definitely worth checking out. With its intuitive mechanics, captivating story, and beautiful world, it's an experience that will stay with you long after the embers fade.

Final Score: 4.5 out of 5 stars

After mining for hours and building a castle in the sky I started farming heads of bosses to decorate the walls. I always find something to do, if it's base upgrades, farming bosses / materials, completing quests, exploring, etc.

The game really has that sense of wonder but with a hint of the emptiness of an MMO without players. The world feels massive at first, but feels a bit smaller the more you learn the map and get better gliders and more fast travel locations. At which point the world feels less sparse.

This is the game i've been waiting for, if they can make an solid story and campaign line this would become easily GOTY. Exploration, Base Building, Puzzles, Deadly Environments (shroud), Boss fights and COOP! 

+ Gameplay feels good. 
+ Great graphics (Aside from not being able to adjust certain things, like DoF or Bloom, or... MOTION BLURRRRRRRRRrrrrrr gah.
+ The world itself presents danger (the shroud).
+ Some of the boss fights are crazy and super fun to fight. 
+ Some pretty fun puzzles
+ Doesn't spoon feed you locations, you have to actually explore to find hot spots. 
+ Ability to make your own ""Teleport"" for fast travels to hot spots after you find them! 
+ Slow(er) progression, I have a little over 55 hours and just hit level 15. 
+ Map looks large! 

- Unsure on actual map size.
- Lacking some graphical customization leads to some parts of the game looking like it has a white filter over it. Can't adjust bloom, dof, or motion blur.
- NO ingame chat for public servers (Game is designed for friends so most people use discord anyways).
- No Emotes
- Map management is mid, you can way point locations but not rename the waypoints.
- When talking with an NPC and then walking away, the camera does a weird little zoom out that takes a second or two. For me i close the dialog menu and start to turn / run away instantly. The camera view causes does not move normally and can actually make you feel nauseous for a second or two. 
- It's sometimes hard to delete large amounts of blocks in claimed area resulting in you using the single block remove which can take sometime. (Sometimes placing blocks over the blocks and then deleting it will remove all, but you get no credit for the initial blocks.) 
- Past the ""alpha area"" the world doesn't look created, concerned that this may be a very well put together time sink money grab. (Even buying AAA games give me this feeling since 2015...)",1706591006,1708048286,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Probably a solid 20-30 hours of gameplay for most people which is good in its current state, cant wait to see what the future holds.
Oh and by the way, magic > melee (until they balance it), enemies attack unreasonably fast and do way too much damage for the melee to suck as bad as it does.

I am very VERY impressed with this game and am excited to see how it expands. There is a boatload of content in this game, which is rare for early-access titles these days. This brings back that excitement that teenage me had playing Skyrim for the first time, so much to do and see here. Exploration feels great, so many hidden secrets and vast landscapes that are full of things to do. The base building mechanics this game are probably the most in depth that I've seen in a game of this genre, you can really detailed and come up with very unique designs if you want to, or you can keep it simple very easily if that more your style.

All in all, this game is the perfect blend between an open world RPG and a survival base building game.

I've kinda gotten used to it, but it still sucks. The one good thing about it is that the frame rate stays relatively solid, even if it literally sits at the aforementioned values.

Enshrouded is a pretty massive addition to the genre. The world is the biggest I've seen in a while and is absolutely FILLED with markers to find and explore. The glider, which is really more like a wing suit in this one, is a nice addition that lets you get to the markers faster, but I'm not a huge fan of how it controls. I feel like it's forcing me more downward than anything else. Still, I appreciate being able to travel quickly from A to B.

The combat is that typical ""Souls"" style that we've come to know and love over the years. The knockback seems a little random, but I have a feeling that can be remedied with the skill tree which, like the over world, is massive. A lot of it is minor stat buffs, but littered throughout the multiple different pathways are a slew of abilities that fundamentally change the way your character functions in their role, like a double jumping, long gliding, ground pounding assassin.

Lastly, Enshrouded has the best building system I've seen....probably since Minecraft. It allows you to chuck physics out the window and basically do whatever you want. Structures don't have to make sense, they can overlap, and....my favorite part, you can edit down to the smallest size of voxel (1x1, I guess) that exists in the game. So you can basically create pixel art. The ability to snap build still exists, but like physics, you can just ignore it. I absolutely cannot wait to see all the crazy builds the community is going to come up with using this incredibly simple yet vastly powerful editing tool. I haven't even seen all the different materials yet, so the color combinations are potentially endless.

Overall? It's a decent game and a nice entry into the long list of survival/crafting games that have come before it. Enshrouded doesn't differ much from what we've seen in the past, but the world is enticing, the combat is serviceable, and the building is SO good.

I'm not very good at Souls-like, I haven't played a Zelda game since Majora's mask, and I don't have a ton of time to learn a bunch of crafting mechanics. ENSHROUDED is for people like me, who may have interest in games like I mentioned earlier, but don't know where to start. I don't want to say they hand hold you through everything, because they absolutely do not. But the game is simple enough for anyone to both pick up & play and immediately be creative. It somehow blends together all these different styles, while maintaining their own identity within the game world. 

I'm currently in the early access at the time of writing this, and there is only a small corner of the avaible map right now... But that small corner is almost bigger than any map I've ever played on in a free roaming setting.  With more being added later I believe. 

Combat is simple but snappy. The RPG skill tree is amazing, and lets you build towards the playstyle you like. And crafting is  as simple as going to a npc and hitting space bar on the item you ant to make.

The only things that are slightly annoying currently are some questionable balancing and a few graphical issues, thats it.

On the plus:
- It looks fantastic. Reminds me about a more colourful Elden Ring.
- The world is designed with a lot of interesting points of interest. There is no way you look from a hill and don't see anything that strikes your fancy. Destroyed villages, castles, weird glowing in the dark, whatever. It is really inviting to just run around and explore.
- It is actually difficult. Not because you die to hunger or thirst if you don't replinesh a bar for a few minutes but because the enemies are actually dangerous and the combat requires some skill.
- No mounts and no fast travel everywhere makes the world feel really big. Instead you get a glider, which is a lot of fun. Though, you can fast travel to a few towers and to points you can place yourself.
- The atmosphere in some biomes is absolutely fantastic. Running through dense forests at night with ground fog, lights from behind the large trees and creepy sounds is just tense.
- The building system is *fantastic*. You can build your square block buildings made of stone if you wish or you can build some really cool, cozy, intricate designs.
- It is really well polished for an early access game. I only had a hand full of minor issues (like the LoDs on objects not loading properly).
- The game actually gives the player(s) tangible goals and a purpose instead of just going ""make your own fun"", as so many others do.

This game is already well worth its money as far as I can tell so far.

But don't expect some sort of great survival innovation. The game does nothing particularly new but what it does it does really well. If you enjoy survival or base building games you *have* to play this.

Edit: After playing over 20 hours more some additional criticsm and notes.

- I still love the building system. You can either just plant down walls like in Ark or Palworld and build yourself your box or you can place tiny blocks and customize everything to your liking. You can even stamp holes into larger pieces you placed. I love the way the parts connect ogether to make them feel like they actually belong together. I wish every survival game would have a building system like this.
- The world is big and has a lot of interesting places but ... they repeat themselves very fast and are often pointless. There isn't really a reason to run into every building, cellar or dungeon. Most of the time you just get some random crafting materials you could get way faster by other means.
- I like the puzzle dungeons. But I wish they would be a bit more diverse in its traps and goals.
- Nights in the large forest biome are seriously creepy. Sadly the game doesn't follow it up with some creepy monster attack chances or something.
- The crafting balancing is a bit weird. Some items you need a lot of are super slow/hard to craft, others you do not need many throw themselves at you. Like, why does it take so long to create some flour?
- Generally I am not entiely sure what the progression path is. At times I unlock craftable items that require items I cannot craft yet because the NPC didn't give me the quest.
- Still love that they separated crafting and power progression. I hate systems where you get skillpoints just to unlock more crafting possibilities. I like that Enshrouded just unlocks stuff based on quest progress or if you have simple collected a relevant crafting item.
- Though, both prior points also go straight into another issue I have with many survival/crafting games: The game sometimes unlocks things weirdly late. For example, I unlocked the ""refined stone wall"" after over 20 hours in the game. I would have expected this to be the baseline considering what other stuff I was able to craft at that point. Or baking some flatbread, that is only possible after like 4 or 5 core level upgrades, which takes a long time.
- The game has no building physics and I love it.  Many survival games forget that they are supposed to be fun, not ""realistic"".
- Your base has a ""comfort level"" which seemingly is not only important for NPC to give you tasks but also to give you a passive buff that - among other things - raises your max Stamina. Making your base beautiful is actually worth it.
- The combat is generally fun, but please add the possibility to just hold down leftclick for weapons that have no charge attack. I am getting carpal tunnel from the wands.
- Speaking of, the enemies are dumb as a brick. That is offset by them doing tons of damage. I had enemies on the same level as me take like 3/4 of my HP with one hit. Regular enemies. Good thing they are so stupid.",1707603509,1708035885,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

[h2]Observations after 20 Hours[/h2]
It's quite clear as originally indicated the game has a lot in common with Valheim.  While there are some differences, overall if you liked Valheim you'll probably enjoy playing Enshrouded.  In addition, if there were things you didn't like about Valheim, there are also things you won't like about Enshrouded.

[b][i]Some Noteable Similarities:[/i][/b]
[list]
[*]Some recipes get discovered by acquiring a material or crafting item for the first time.
[*]A significant portion of gear/technology progression is tied to the elimination and looting of bosses.
[*]In combat, generally speaking the player wants to avoid facetanking enemies.  Blocking/parrying/dodging are a good idea even in 1 vs 1 engagements due to the relatively high damage of some enemies.
[*]Consuming food is for buffs and health/stamina regeneration.  The player won't die standing still and not eating (i.e. no hunger/thirst mechanic).
[*]Getting the rested buff by being in the presence of fire and comfort items in a sheltered area.
[/list]

[b][i]Some Noteable Differences:[/i][/b]
[list]
[*]The player can build with very small blocks of all building type materials, allowing for a much more refined final creation.  Building has no structure integrity in Enshrouded.
[*]Enemy difficulty is based on levels and there aren't champion/elite variants in Enshrouded.
[*]Enemies don't respawn in the presence of the player in Enshrouded.
[*]Progression in Enshrouded is tied to both boss killing and NPC crafter acquisition and subsequent quests (to collect crafting related items so you can make additional workstations).
[*]Player growth in Valheim is largely influenced by skill-ups but in Enshrouded it's from leveling, ability points and upgrading the Flame Altar.
[*]Valheim is significantly more visually atmospheric when compared to the non-shrouded areas in Enshrouded.  The weather effects and biome specific lighting are top notch in Valheim.  Outside of the shroud in Enshrouded there aren't weather effects like rain and storms, it's either light during day or dark during night with a small sunrise/sunset transition in between as appropriate.
[*]There's a significant amount of lore notes and quests in Enshrouded as opposed to the handful of objectives you get in Valheim.
[*]Enshrouded's map isn't procedurally generated.  I've noticed the design of the POIs is a bit more involved and the traversal/exploration based puzzles associated with them are pretty satisfying to solve.
[*]There are no PvE raids in Enshrouded like there are in Valheim.
[*]Don't appear to be set-bonuses for armor in Enshrouded.
[*]Seems more convenient to get gear upgrades by finding high rarity drops in the world and upgrading them with runes rather than crafting in Enshrouded.  Perhaps this changes later in the game.
[*]Health potions aren't on timers in Enshrouded.
[*]There aren't elemental effects to worry about in Enshrouded that requires specific gear (such as extreme cold).
[/list]

[h2]Observations after 70 Hours[/h2]
Overall a very solid entry into Early Access with a strong foundation capable of significantly differentiating itself from other titles and providing a satisfying experience for fans of the open world crafting survival/survival-like type games.  Though it certainly will still give off strong vibes from other games, such as Valheim.

The following are some lasting thoughts on some key differences between Enshrouded and Valheim:
[list]
[*]No real logistics around the transport of key resources (i.e. metal via boat).  Magnified by the fact there's no weight mechanic and you can use a glider to traverse long distances as well as teleport between Ancient Spires and Flame Altars.
[*]No structural integrity mechanics for building.
[*]No real consumable/gear requirements for traversing different zones based on weather effects.

Bosses- walking meat shields no exciting skills or difficulty in killing them except maybe one.

Quests- seem really boring and don't make sense. Go grab this large piece of equipment that is in a different location than most of my other things for no real discernible reason

Crafting- oh god....why does everything cost so much and why do I need 20 different workstations

Visuals- its pretty but the fog seems to kind of ruin it too frequently its fairly difficult to appreciate a world you can only see 25% of at any given time.

The skill tree - needs hardcore work its terribly unbalanced all the classes are garbage compared to mage.

    Pros- The World is amazing and full of adventure
           - The Weapons and gear are interesting and look decent
           - The Fast travel are placed to create the right amount of adventure and travel without taking away from the game itself.
           - game play and exploring is amazing.
           - Building with voxels are awesome, lacks some features but still has great potential.

    Cons:
           The skill tree is all mixed up and nothing seems very organized. Basically a Dumpsterfire for Class building as you waste allot of points in totally usless area's. whoever designed this has a few extra chromosomes for sure.

          - Building on your home plot should not cost any stamina or durability.
          - Tank Skills Need to provide more damage mitigation for balance if the person tanking cannot tank

The game has a nice balance of combat, exploration and questing. The map is huge beyond imagining unfortunately only the lower half is accessible in early access. 
I'm finding it very easy to kill mobs 3 to 5 levels higher than I am. I've had to fight 2 of the boss mobs before I reached level 10 and the Wyrm boss when I hit level 13 , all in melee combat. I died a few times on the first boss learning how to do it but have 2 shotted them all since.

Early game the crafting recipes are fairly simple with lots of gatherable mats nearby. In middle and late game look for high burn-downs and a real cascading mats effect (imagine: you only need 5 of an item but that item requires 30 of one kind of sub item which requires 15 of one of its mats to make each of the 30 which you can only get by random drop from killing mobs)
Water is a real problem. Its a high demand mat but wells dole it out only so many water per period of time and the only other place to get it is random chests.

There is a lot of quest gating so if you're not constantly completing the quests you can find yourself missing important tools or equipment or stuck in your progress without knowing why. A really bad example is an important recipe that only becomes available when you try to craft a mat that you only need for that recipe that you don't have yet!

There is a regionalism to the things you need so you can find yourself needing to access regions that your not ready for.

One of the things I hate with this game are all of the mountain walls. Verticality in a game is fine but they've made the game an open world but then trapped you into specific areas and paths with mountain walls. Now its one thing to be hemmed in and having to fight your way to an objective but my real issue is trying to follow a way-point to a quest location on a covered map only to meet a giant mountain wall and needing to backtrack to find a way around or on top of the wall to get to the target location and then discovering the location was underground (below where you're standing) through a cave entrance on the other side of the wall! I've wasted more than a few hours dealing with that.

There is a farming aspect. Mat collecting gets a lot easier with farming but the farming is a very manual and repetitive task for a game. Even with snaps turned on planting a couple hundred plants is a very manual process and its not like the plants just regrow after a harvest, You have to replant. It would be nice if they would simply plant all the seedlings you're carrying without the need to position each individual seedling.

Bugs: most are small issues, graphic tears, flickering UI displays, stuff you can can look past. I've had roughly 5 or 6 crash-to-desktop situations though all of which happened near the starting area. Items I was gathering at the time where lost and the play was rolled back some 15-30 minutes.

Overall the game is relaxing and engaging. Of course there are things that could be better as with anything but all in all its a good game,

Performance is all over the place and at times it feels like the game goes below 60fps even though it doesn't. The building system is fine i guess but the camera position makes actually placing tiles difficult at certain angles and the tiles themselves get in the way of what you're trying to see most of the time so switch to a small one then switch back, it's a clunky system that needs more fine tuning.

I had the unfortunate realization that these developers took notes from ubisoft on how to make an open world. Towers you climb, activate a thing then P.O.Is get revealed on your map. Go to those locations and find little more than a few enemies that don't pose much challenge and a chest that likely contains garbage items. Congratulations you cleared the area and a shiny check mark gets placed on the map marker, now go do the rest.

Another thing that immediately put me off was crafting timers ripped straight out of a mobile game. You know, those timers made to waste your time so you spend a few dollars on gems to speed the timer up. These have no business being in this game. You could make the argument that they incentivise you to go explore while the items craft but from another review i read, end game timers get close to being an hour long. There's time wasting and then there's maliciously padding out play time for no good reason.

Combat is another point of frustration. You're animation locked for all attacks and you can then follow up with another attack but the timing window on this follow up is either placed in the wrong spot of the animation or is so small its nearly impossible to hit it with a single click. The best way to do the entire 3 swing combo is to just spam the shit out of your attack button and hope the enemy you're fighting doesn't stun you out of it because, surprise! you can't stun enemies unless you parry them. Parrying would be fine but there's a cool down on when you can actually raise your shield so you need to sit there and wait for the enemy to throw out an attack to then get the parry. Then 10 seconds go by and you're just having a stare down until it finally realizes it's supposed to do something.

This game just feels like the developers took idea's from a plethora of other games and thought they could do them better, but then added these bizarre elements and design choices that just make playing this game tedious. If you're on the fence about getting this I'd say don't bother unless you're the kind of person that just really likes open world survival crafting games.",1707962461,1708022474,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This means that once you have enough resources from earlier biomes, you will organically branch out to further and further places to explore.
CAVEAT: There are some places where enemy variety would really help. Once you put in 5-10 hours into a new biome, it can feel too familiar even when exploring some new points of interest. This could get better though, as we are still in early access.

2. Almost all environments are interactable, since everything is created using voxels. I have blown holes into the walls of a fort to ambush enemies from a less guarded direction and tunneled into a locked room using a pickaxe to avoid finding a key. I've even glided onto the roof of a building and blasted my way through the ceiling using bombs, so I could have the advantage as an archer. This is something I have not seen in a game with such graphical fidelity. There are no caveats to this - it's just great how you can approach encounters in unexpected ways.

3. PRO: Character build freedom - you're not locked into a particular class, and you get nearly free respecs in case you want to change the way your character plays. You can also mix and match skills - i.e. three traits in the Trickster branch, five traits in the Warrior branch. 
CAVEAT: All builds really fall into four or five main playstyles in the game, and a few playstyles are stronger than the others. We need to get more skills incorporated, or mod them ourselves. Increased weapon variety would also improve the game quite a bit for the full release.

4. PRO: Base building is fluid - it is easy to create some really great designs with the terrain / tiles you can craft. In fact, base builders will probably get a lot more mileage out of the game than pure questers - since you will have more reason to return to different areas to gather materials. CAVEAT: There are no base raids, and the developers have not intended to add them. Your motivation to build a base has to be purely aesthetic, not gameplay driven. Also, there is a placeable that you can use to stake out any area as a new base - the zone is pretty large, but there are only a limited number of you can place. Outside of these zones you mark, the world resets every time you log back in, or every 30 mins if you leave the area for a while. This may take getting used to if you come from games that let you change the world permanently.

The bones are really, really good for this game. There are so many opportunities present here for the game to get even better as we give feedback during early access.

The content does not look very finished (hence EA?) but the point is, the current game already has a lot of copy-paste things going on, so I don't really have high hopes of the future updates. I probably won't play it at all.
The game is in an awkward mid-point of two things: a Zelda-like open world exploration game with a loose main quest system guiding you to a final end, and a total base-building sandbox. It currently achieved neither.

The game gets a bit repetitive as you play, especially when the NPCs hand you endless fetch-me-this quests.

I think it is, but let me tell you about my experience so you can make your own decision.
I played the game until the midgame, so my review will reflect on this.
This is the kind of game my brother would say: It's more of the same. It's Valheim but with different graphics.
And in short it is. Kind of.
It's like saying Battlefield is kind of like COD.
If you think the same, just stop reading and go play something else that is ""original""
But is Enshrouded just Valheim 2.0?
Lets dig in.

The map is hand crafted and it shows.
The one thing that Enshrouded has that is by far the best part is exploration.
You might find that some house layouts are the same. But it's not that this one duplicated house is a standalone house.
And with that I mean you don’t find the same house, alone, along the road. Copy pasted over and over with different colours.
It's one house in a small settlement that just happens to be the same house you saw at lvl2.
And even if you find a similar looking house, there are some changes in it. Not big but they could contain treasure!!
So you walk through them, just in case.
Exploration
When is the last time that you wandered around in any Gameworld, saw a cave and though: lets have a look.
Only to find it's a small cave with maybe 1 chest, crap loot and some mats. Not worth the bother.
Here you can find these caves of course, but some go deeper.  Opening up to contain an old mine, with special materials, chest and at the end a boss.
They are NOT marked in anyway.
This make exploration worth while in my opinion.

Quests:
You get quests from npc's you free in the world (it's not an extreme grind to get them)
In past games, it feels more like this.
You get a quest to get, let's say, a powerful sword.
So you craft gear, a good weapon, some food and off you go. It's a medium difficult quest and hurray you got the sword.

Here the quest is: go get my equipment so I can make you some better armour.
So you go get it.
No gear crafting or weapon crafting because you can only make crap gear and the location the npc is sending you is in a place where enemy's are 5 lvl's higher then you.
Sure you can grind to get better but here the quest isn't unlocked because you got to lvl 5. It's unlocked because you completed the previouse one.
Meaning you can finish this game at lvl1 if you want to.


Classes / combat
This is the only issue I have with the game.
To put it simple, you have 3 main classes
Melee, ranged and magic

Let me start to say that any of these are good. You can finish the game with any of them and they all feel good at the start.
It's just that some fall off in the end (even in midgame you start to feel it)
This is btw my experience SOLO.
I'm sure that a group of 4 ppl, all with sword and or bows will kill anything

Melee: It's what some say, souls like. But it's just not powerfull enough. Enemy's hit hard and then you haven't faced a boss yet.
For me, melee feels like a tool to finish off monsters or deal with the trash mobs

Ranged: It's fun, but your damage is on the lower side, meaning alot of arrows. But you need to craft the higher level ones with rare materials.
At the start they are easy to make, but a bit later you need other mats.
Not that big of a deal, you say. But if you want to craft 100 arrows, you need to first get some sticks you can find from bushes and you can grow at your base. But the rest of the mats for the higher lvl arrows, you need to go out and find.
So you can't quickly craft a few arrows. You need to go to a mine, mine the ore, smelt it and then you got the arrow.
With melee, you are ready now
With magic, you are ready now
with a bow you need to craft them. Don't forget about the low damage, so those 100 arrows are gone before you know it.
If I need to work this much for my arrows, I want them to do more damage


Magic: Your wand shoots medium ranged bolt's that don't run out and your staff is an overpowered long range cannon.
You see where this is going?
Can this be fixed? Sure
Make parry's in melee work better and let a counter do more damage
Make arrows cheaper and reward headshots with more damage
Leave magic alone, it's fine

I feel that the arrow issue could be resolved now if you play with a team and only you use arrorws.

The big question now is, am I having fun?
Yes
May I remind you that this game is 30-40€
It’s not a triple A of Quadruple A game and that is, in this time, good news.
I can only imagine what they would do with that budget.
The game is a blast and I hope it’s an even bigger blast with friends. But then again, so are most games.

The base building is quite well designed but serves very little purpose beyond a place to store junk and the ""NPC's"" There is little point to building anything beyond a box to live in at this point as there are no ingame mechanics that are impacted nor are there any form of attacks to build defences against.

The ""NPC's"" are for all intents and purposes what would be a workbench in any other survival game, they do absolutely nothing in and of themselves, the Hunter does not hunt, the Farmer does not grow or harvest your crops and none of them are capable of combat.  

The combat is functional, easy for the most part but not bad beyond a lack of variety.

The exploration is a mixed bag, initially the world seems very interesting with the whole ""shroud"" but a few hours in its mostly running through area's with very little difference while dealing with the stamina system (which like Valheim is influenced by food/drink) which is used by pretty much everything and is not quick to recover.  A further Issue I had was the amount of places in the world with rather slippy hills surrounding the Shroud which will without warning drop you down to an obscured area with a high chance of you landing on instant death causing  ground.  You then get to run the whole way back and hope that your stuff is recoverable.

There is no pause.  Much of the game requires you to enter area's with a literal timer which result in death if exceeded while the usual ""alternative"" of quitting and loading will in this spawn you at your base, sometimes 10 minutes travelling away while also respawning any dead enemies, cut down trees, looted treasure chests etc.

Fighting is fun, the building system offers a lot of possibilities and unlocking new recipes and skills is motivating. The atmosphere is fantastic thanks to the beautiful lighting and the excellent background noise. 

However, the game also has some points that I don't like. The world is very repetitive, the biomes hardly offer any unique places worth exploring. Everything seems recycled and if you do find a chest, the loot in it is often incredibly disappointing. There should also be more (non-biome-bound) resources so that you don't discover everything in the new biome after just a short exploration. 

Unfortunately, the quests aren't really exciting either, neither the associated dialogues nor the tasks themselves. Sometimes you go to the quest area and have completed the task without knowing what you've actually done... 

Some smaller features are also missing, For example, that you can choose to keep your loot when you die, easily change/upgrade building blocks that have already been placed into a different material, or be able to harvest crops more easily with a scythe.

Things I would suggest:
- you should be able to access magic chests for when you want to use the different crafting tools instead of having to comb through them and run back and forth
- when building you should be able to access the building materials that are in magic chests instead of needing them in backpack
- more NPCs!! First survival game where I didn’t feel completely isolated and I like that a lot

And currently you can't auto loot which means you have to pick up everything that's on the ground manually and that can get tedious.

1. Combat feels overtuned and undertuned in all the wrong spots, AI is bad to awful. Hitting enemies and getting hit does not feel good. I realized I was actually avoiding enemies after awhile because its just not satisying enough to warrant me wasting time stoppping.

2. Building is good. But there is no reason to build. And all the cool spots have structures/shrines/camps already placed there. I ended up using the same dirty shack I hastily built at the start the whole time, just waiting to find a new spot. 39 hours in, havent really found any winners.

3. Exploration is solid. But my lord the running. So. Much. Running. Ugh.

4. Music is extremely hit and miss. It really effects the immersion. My base music in general made me depressed, and not in a good way.

5. No water, and waay too much fungal growth feels nasty. No creeks, rivers, lakes, or ocean. In its place the red, flat, unmoving, texture they put in is just offputting. It seems like a concious choice, but at least some would have really helped. 

6. The talent trees are uninspired and all over the place. Locking useful talents behind useless talents is lame. Also locking QoL features such as stamina behind talent tree options is lazy and also pretty darn lame imo. Also a huge lack of playstyle variety.

All in all this is not a bad game, but it feels like a modern day verion of an rpg maker game to me. Like they built a cool looking map and just went around placing things, with no real north star or vision. Its missing a soul or identity of its own somehow. all the pieces are there in place, but they just dont jive. It feels like it needs to be gutted and rethought out from the ground up, but they are way too far in to do that so, this is what the core of the game is and will be even after full release. If you have nothing better to play then go for it. But if your looking for a game to spend a couple hundred hours, this probably wont be it for you.

There are many similarities, including progression, with that game. You start in one biome, gather resources there to upgrade to be able to handle the next biome to collect the resources there to then do the next.

Pros
- Exploring the world
- Variety of character builds
- The best base building I have ever seen

Cons
- Boring combat. Most enemies have a long wind up, so they are easily dodged. I used wands, and so just backing up was the best strategy.
- The enemy variety got fairy repetitive. There are common enemies that are everywhere, with a couple new ones per biome. I hope they add more.
- The endgame. Basically, there isn't one. There is no payoff to the story. You just reach the end at some point, and only have base building and resource collecting left. 

Overall, well made, but could feel more.....full? Not sure the word I want to use. If you view the suggested improvements area, there are many things that this could use.

You can farm... by going through tedious crafting menus where you need to stand near certain NPCs, wait for the workshops to give you the materials you need, and then craft the item you then plant and just collect after a certain amount of time.

You can craft... each item individually in your cluttered, unorganized, and limited inventory space that is also where all of your gear, materials, and spells are. Also better remember whether the recipe you want is accessed by an NPC menu, a crafting table menu, or your character's crafting menu. There's no search function, by the way.

You can fight... which basically consists of basic lock on attacking, spamming left click, blocking with right click, and getting annoyed with how useless dodge in coop unless you live close to the host. There's magic, but you have to collect consumable spells to stack in your (again) limited and cluttered inventory space, and each spell type takes up a different item slot.

You can explore... a single map that is very clearly in an early access game where areas feel empty and monotonous the further you stray from the starting area and quest locations.

You can build your character how you want it... except leveling is slow, certain builds are basically useless, and the entire magic side of it feels tedious once you realize you have to stock up on spells that take up (once again) limited and cluttered inventory space in an exploration & gathering game.

The real disappointment in this game is just how it feels like swallowing cardboard every time you play and the only reason I played as much as I did was because it just takes that long to traverse the map at the start of the game and once I was stuck with the game I tried to enjoy it and get my money worth but I just couldn't. I have no interest in the late game content as I feel completely disconnected from characters with the personality of a low budget online mobile game.

The game shouldn't have even included a character creator if it was going to take such a lazy approach to it. The female character body is laughably disproportional with broad shoulders and massive breasts. Even worse there are only around a dozen faces total to choose from (both male and female) and the only changes you can make are to hair styles and colors (Hair, Eye and Skin). no changes can be made to the actual face structure or body.

The game would have been much better with a pre-scripted character with a back story and a personality instead of leaving players with so little to go on in customizing their character. Some players may be ok with this but to me it feels like the character creation was tacked on at the last minute when they decided to make the game multiplayer focused. This decision leaves the game feeling very bland and very boring for single player characters as outside of the building system the game boils down to fetch quest and repetitive combat.

I don't usually down rate or refund games but in this case I feel like the devs intentionally made the map and the gameplay in a way that even the most expert gamer would exceed the time to refund before realizing that what they bought is a flashy box with just a blank piece of cardboard inside. Building system aside and a few decent game mechanics such as gliding and a few puzzles to solve (The combat system is too easy to be considered good) the game over all feels like it could have easily been a F2P MMO but I've seen plenty of those have better story and character personality than this.",1707976434,1707976694,False,9,0,0.509092867374420166,0,True,False,True

I played solo for quite some time and have had a ton of fun. If this were a single player or 1-4 player co-op game I would recommend it wholeheartedly.

However, they advertised this as a 16 player dedicated server game. Despite that it progresses like a single player game. I joined the server after someone had rescued the first NPC, and I could no longer complete any of the starter quests. I had to leave the server and start the game in single player so that I could actually do the tutorial. Now the dedicated server we created is completely dead, even though several of my friends are still playing solo.

* progression is tied to the server, so if you're offline when something happens you don't get credit.
* there is only one of each NPC per server, so if someone else summons it while you're talking to him he disappears from your base.
* [strike]bosses only drop one item to be shared amongst all people playing.[/strike] Semi-fixed. Bosses now have a [b]chance[/b] to drop more items with more players.
* [strike]bosses do respawn, but only after the server is restarted.[/strike] Fixed. Respawn is now 30 minutes, which may be a bit too fast.
* you are only allowed eight bases on a 16 player server, and that's only after maximally upgrading your first base.

All of these points would be fine in a one to four player co-op peer-to-peer experience. However, on a dedicated server they are just unacceptable. If these issues are resolved, I will come back and change my review to be 100% positive.

Note 02/15/24: The developers have made a long and detailed post about the issues above. I am cautiously optimistic that this may be fixed. I would prefer more server options to allow people to play the way they like.",1706213355,1707975941,False,6,0,0.544288814067840576,0,True,False,True

Progress works great, feels natural, and encourages you to steadily move away from your home location. I've barely done anything, somehow done a lot, and feel like there is so much more to do.

Long A: Within this medieval fantasy world you have the ability to fast travel to any build-able flame shrine or permanent ancient spire. You have a wide selection of building materials, many of which are unlocked through quest progression. There are a TON of set building options as well as the ability to free build down to a 1x1 block (roughly the size of a Lego stud). If you enjoy farming and gardening, this is absolutely a game for you. The world regenerates around you, including resource mines, tunnels, etc. The only exception to this is if you are within the radius of a flame shrine. There are magic chests that allow you to draw from them without opening them. Thankfully, there is no attrition for fixing broken gear. The skill tree allows for a pretty wide selection of play styles, although it does favour (heavily) dps mages. The flight suit allows for fast movement and quicker totem recovery if you die.

Now for a few cons. This is NOT a procedurally generated world, everyones experience is nearly identical as far as map and land formations are concerned. The bosses are confusing and feel more like mini-bosses. It is unclear to me what order you're ""supposed"" to fight the bosses in, but it definitely feels like the Pike boss should be the final boss, however you have to kill it early on in order to upgrade your flame. Being forced into this fight early makes it extremely fun and challenging, but sets a precedent that is disappointing thereafter as the last two bosses are hardly even noticeable (I literally 2 shot the last boss on accident mistaking it for something else). Magic and battle mages are straight up overpowered. The way you traverse the map in order to complete the story missions is good if you aren't bothered by it feeling out of order (this could just be me). 

Recap: I love playing this game with friends or gardening solo. I wish the bosses were more clear cut and harder to beat. I wish armor loot from chests was more random (I kept getting duplicate weapons or armor from the same higher rarity chests over and over).

I read a lot of reviews, and a few were saying things like ""not much content, I completed the main story line in 40h,"" but those reviewers also said they didn't explore the side quests much. I've just reached 40h, and I'm still in the Springlands (starting) biome - just about to venture forth into the second main biome. So really, there is plenty of content, and I think the devs have done a really good job.

I've encountered only a couple of bugs. Now and then items disappear from my backpack - especially lockpicks. I've crafted a few, gone to the place I need them and find they're not there any more, but my raw materials are also gone. I once found a way through a mountain range which was a hole in the wall from one direction but not the other. I've done that twice now. But hey, it is early access.

The enemy AI is static and shallow, and there are no consequences if you die (your death marker retains only common items - twigs and such). 

Valheim has raids and enemies that seek you out if you make noise. The Forest has enemies who raid your base. Minecraft have creepers who will blow up your base if you get too complacent.   Enshrouded has none of these type threats to it's PvE gameplay, and it is a detriment to making the world feel alive, dangerous, and meaningful. The story is hard to follow and disjointed due to how you pick up bits of lore at the various encampments.

Enshrouded is an open-world survival crafting game (I know.  Another one) with RPG elements.  My main issue with survival crafting games is a lack of direction, and character progression.  Enshrouded fixes this issue for me with the addition of a dynamic skill tree, and quests.  When playing with friends it feels more like a party RPG.  I have wanted a non-MMO RPG with co-op for a while, so this game is currently satisfying that itch.

A couple issues I have with Enshrouded are I feel the shroud mechanic, while a cool concept, can be tedious at times.  Additionally, I feel there is a lack of challenge in later levels.  Some things I'd like to see are: settlement raids, mounts, and shared quest progression.

Save that stuff for player feedback in the discussions. Review what is there, rather than what isnt. So, that being said, lets dive into another review.

First of all, those that dont like long winded reviews, I'll go ahead and say that this is a 10/10 must have game. great building, interesting combat and a really large world with hidden secrets all over the place. Interesting puzzles to figure out, and content beyond that of any quests, there for those with adventurous spirits.

This is an amazing voxel game that honestly has the best building system ive ever seen implemented, offering some amazing freedom and design options that other games never come close to offering. seems like one thing that a lot of other EA games miss on straight out the game is railing options, and random roof pieces. This game definitely went above and beyond to ensure that builders are happy with having tons of building options in place.

Theres a lot of freedom in the story of this game. A questing system that allows you to do things at your leisure, you get to set your own pace. Explore a bit, quest a bit, and progress the game a little at a time. Or go crazy and knock out all the quests as fast as possible. There is a bit of quest driven area gating, but its mildly enforced and can be over come extremely easily. The map is massive, and just when you think youve seen it all, youll stumble into what seems to be an entirely different world. Lots of biomes to explore, enemies to kill, and structures to delve.

In regards to combat, I found it incredibly well done. You definitely cant face roll in this game, as it requires you to utilize a variety of tactics to stay alive. The difficulty seems perfect, and scales well with the level of gear you find/craft along the way. There are situations that may require the use of block, parry, dodge and strafing all within the same fight. each enemy has a unique fighting style, making it even more interesting when you get swarmed. 

All in all, this will be a favorite of mine, and will likely be the game that i devote myself too for a long time to come. I'd encourage everybody to give this Early Access game a chance, and try to remember that this is ground zero for a game in its infancy. Its the nature of EA games to lack things you wish were there, but its our patience and positivity that will allow the game to grow.",1707954425,1707954425,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

If devs read these, only 2 things I feel are missing right now. One is a way to craft twigs (example: 1 wood log -> 2 twigs or 1 twig if you think its going to be overpowered) and the other is a way to craft bee farms for easier honey harvesting.
*EDIT* After playing a whole lot more hours, i found that there is already a way to make your own honey farm. Twig problem still stands and more generally, arrows needs a good quantity balancing. No matter how much I farm and grind for arrows, I always seemed to run out while my friend who was playing a wand mage was consistently doing similar dmg outputs (sometimes way more with staff) and he never had a problem with grinding for spells which seems a bit unfair to archers. 

Level scaling definitely needs a good balance because loot dont change from low level to high level and a lot of times I found that I had to progress through very high level enemies (most of times 5 levels+) to continue.",1707162998,1707947926,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- Probably some, if not the best, base building in the genre. Adding the single block mechanic makes it to where you can customize virtually everything. 
- Plenty of allowed space to let you build whatever you want (looking at you palworld) 
- Deleting floors and letting your bases items ""float"" so you can replace floors/walls easier is such a good quality of life perk. 
- For EA, plenty of content to unlock along the way
- Huge map

Cons/Things I'd like to see
- The dodging seems weird. There's no I frame, or if there is, it's super inconsistent. Blocking is usually better use of your stamina bar it feels like. 
- The talent tree could use some more love. Apart from a few abilities, you don't ""feel"" the level-up. 
- Make ""fixing"" the world feel better. Right now, I'll clear something, and besides that little area, I don't feel like I made an impact on the world. I'm mainly exploring and getting stronger so I can build more things, rather than helping fix the shroud. 
- After palworld, having workers on your base was just such an awesome mechanic that I wish we would see more in this genre.

Graphix [X] Super - feels soft like Gewnshin Impact but is beautiful like Valheim

Movement [X] Okay - It is janky but there is a flow and when u nail a glider landing it can feel epic

Combat [X] Wonky as that squirrel who can't decide whether to cross the road, turn back, or stand in the middle of the road...much of it can be cheesed using exploits of the environment, game mechanix, monster mechanix, or just dumb luck. When they work it's great. When you get stomped because you're camera keeps switching and attacks keep missing....not so much. 

Story [X] There's a story? Must have missed that part. There were some seriously sad elements to the story via remnants left behind to be found by the player. Never could sort out if it was serious or childlike and it felt like the developer didn't know either. 

Recommend [X] Yup. It's got a ""feel"" to it that you have to experience to understand. Hopefully there's more but even as is it's worth $30 easily.",1706725170,1707943020,True,0,0,0.498029917478561401,0,True,False,True

I think there's a strong base game here, but beyond doing what feels like endless fetch quests to advance, I'm not enjoying just being in the game. 

The crafting is pretty much limited to areas you can place a flame alter down at, which is like claiming a property and sets up a perimeter you can build in. I keep hearing comparisons to Valheim, but it's night and day with the crafting between these two games. In Valheim, it's quick to drop a work bench down and start building wherever you are. It feels central to the gameplay and manipulating the landscape with structures feels encouraged and rewarding. In Enshrouded, building is limited to these semi-permanent locations you establish and does not feel central to the gameplay. The only purpose the buildings have is to house stuff and the quest givers/crafters you find. Bases prevent monsters spawning and are completely safe, as far as I know, so I don't feel incentivised to do anything more than create a flat space for boxes and NPCs. Sure, you can build a pretty house if you want, but having a roof and walls is only required to gain a rested bonus and doesn't influence the base functionality. There are a pretty good number of building options as far as shapes to construct with, but the snapping does not feel intuitive. Instead of looking at the object you want the edge to snap to, you look roughly at where the center of the wall/floor/roof would go and that means you're looking at empty space hoping it snaps where you want. Does not feel intuitive.

The world is very large and is a static map that every player experiences. That being said, for a static map, it feels like it was randomly generated and then things are plopped down and maybe tweaked how they want. That seems like the ideal way to make a large place quickly, I don't feel like there's a narrative or sense to the geography. It just feels like you're traveling over a blobby kind of map with no cohesiveness. What I mean by that is think of GTA, Zelda, RDR1/2 maps. You get streams that flow from mountains through forests, meadows, and into lakes or oceans. Villages nestled at the base of mountains or along a lake. Things that make sense and give a flow and form to why the landscape is the way that it is. Right now it's just a lumpy mess.  Imagine a massive earthquake had uplifted and jumbled about the terrain so it looks like a bunch of random plateaus and hills all over the place and that's what this feels like. Additionally, and maybe I'm too early in the game, but it feels like once you explore a specific type of landmark or town, there's no reason to do that again. Each ""town"" or enemy camp you come across has the same stuff going on. Sure, there are chests you can find each time, but the rewards don't feel worth it and I just skip them.

The progression in the game consists of finding NPCs, and then doing fetch quests for them. Getting those items for the NPCs usually opens up more things you can craft. Due to the lack of crafting or construction in the open world in general, and the lumpiness of the terrain, all I feel like I'm doing is grabbing a quest and racing towards the blip while completely ignoring what I'm traveling through and just trying to find the fastest route. Since each important location is marked for you, I don't feel incentivised to explore very much. I wish there was some randomness in the map and things you find to make you want to explore. 

The skill tree is nice, and I really appreciate the ability to form the character how you want. My only gripe with it is I wish there were more action skills you get from it that you can apply in combat. It's mostly passive buffs with a couple skills in there. Double jump is good (if a bit unresponsive at times), and I see a few in there that are good, but it just needs more I think. There's so much potential to have interesting combat skills, but so far combat doesn't feel very fun or satisfying. Each ""tree"" has maybe two skills that you can use.

If any devs read reviews, I would just suggest the following. But hey, you can't make everyone happy.

Make construction more applicable to exploration and the core gameplay, like enabling us to very quickly build scaffolding in the world to reach higher places.

More combat skills for each tree that make each path feel unique.

Some kind of randomness in the map. Maybe events you come across with good loot if you help out. 

Less lumpiness in the map. If the map is static, then I feel like it needs to have a narrative.",1707941738,1707941738,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game runs like absolute trash. 13 FPS in some areas. Then 70 for the most part. But the frame stutters are longer than 30s and causes me to get killed. Happens when I go into the shroud, when the day and night cycle hits and you look at the sky, 

The quests are SHARED not individual (Stupid Move on the devs behalf) The building of 1 singular wall is a 5 step process and feels like you need to be a god damn architect just to be able to make a 2x2 box. 

The combat is very lazy and feels like Conan lowered down to elementary level. 

The acting is mediocre at best. 

The Ui in the game is confusing as hell and the crafting in it self is just crap. 

At this rate you mine as well fork the money into Ark Ascended and deal with the crap on that game because you will at least have a world that is populated and doesnt feel like 70% of it is empty. 

PLUS 2 hours into the game almost and I AM STILL LEVEL 2! thats with Building (Trying to), Combat, Gathering, Exploring, and literally just playing the game.

I like this idea of the shroud and clearing it.  I like that wolves hunt other creatures.  I like the bee swarms.  I like that there is a bit of freedom to do what you want to do.  I enjoy finding lots of secrets even if the rewards aren't the best, so far, it's still exciting to discover.  Not the most attractive graphics nor the worst.  The fighting is challenging enough.  They have added features like the abilities for mobs to jump so you cannot always hide up high and shoot from a distance.  Wands have limited range which may be too limited as they all ready don't hit all that well.  Spells, so far, have to be found and have a limited count.  If this is going to be the norm throughout the game, there are far too little spells to make staves viable.  The skill tree leaves a lot to be desired.  In one of the branches, as far as I can see, there is one skill and it causes a chance to summon a skeleton ally.  The skeleton is a decent pet on the very rare chance that it spawns.  But it doesn't follow you around and has a time limit before it expires, so there has to be guys near it when it spawns, if it spawns.

Game still needs a lot of development.  

Auto aim feature locks on to a second mob, after killing the first, but will lock on to guys too far away to hit when their are guys hitting you--close up.  
I would suggest forcing this to target the closest mob, not the furthest.

When you start to glide, you automatically lose your body height or more in vertical distance.  
Feels and looks very strange.

Game freezes randomly.
Have not figured out a correlation as it has happened on different computers with different hardware multiple times.

The different quest dialogues are pretty poor, like it's written by someone who doesn't speak English.
The main story/intro was very well done and intriguing but flops with the NPCs.

You cannot grab the edges of surfaces and pull yourself up.
This may be hard to change as the map progression seems to be just of or reach in such situations.  But this limits the feel of freedom to explore and do as would be natural.

If you do not have stamina you cannot climb ladders.
This may be hard to change since it seems to be part of the maze aspect of the game, but it feels very unrealistic.

Placement of some objects, I have found, like in most of these games, can be difficult to impossible.  I would suggest adding a feature to lock an item onto a horizontal plain so that it can be edited on a vertical plain once locked in place.

The game search, like many other steam games, cannot find games friends create so you have to manually invite them through steam.

---------------------------------------------------

Pros:

Amazing building system/mechanics; Arguably even better than currently-available offerings (that have decent or great building systems) such as Valheim, Rust, Fortnite, etc.

Fantastic visuals & aesthetic/personality; Really felt like a healthy mix of Dark Souls, Elden Ring, & Remnant I/II in many/most playable areas of the game

Fairly massive open-world map (especially for early access); took around ~40 hours for my first playthrough.

Extremely satisfying exploration (voxel mechanics + bombs = W; super fast gliders; fun exploration skill nodes on skill trees).

Solid skill tree system and ""classes"". You get to make some critical decisions on how your playable character fights & interacts with the world. For the most part, it does feel meaningful on most level-ups.

Satisfying early-to-mid-game progression and combat systems (dodges, parries, consumables/food, & use of quick slots are actually all critical in order to survive).

---------------------------------------------------

Cons:

Difficulty scaling when approaching end-game is very unbalanced. Good RNG coupled with a few gold/silver chests in a late-game area can result in being severely overpowered too early, which can be jarring when the combat was so difficult every moment prior.

Classes/skill designs & mechanics are seemingly biased towards one area/play style. Melee classes are considerably weaker than ranged classes, which are then overshadowed by all magic classes (which are obscenely OP at end-game currently).

Co-op & server-wide play style appears to be a gimmick only (no anti-griefing systems, regions outside of the limited (up to 8) placeable bases will reset periodically, & quests are server-wide and can't be repeated).

---------------------------------------------------

In summary, it has been a fantastic experience, and I do recommend it to anyone that enjoyed Valheim or Terraria (two games with strong building, combat, and RPG mechanics). There is still a good bit of rebalancing and reworks that will need to occur before official launch, but the devs have been responsive to player feedback, so I have hope for the future.

EDIT: I have done quite a number of quests and acquiered the 5 NPCs and explored maybe half the map and enjoyed all of that a lot too. It's my fav game at the moment of this review.

The flame alter system is ingenious: That you can put them up to set up a spawn location and teleport locations is already very practical - but that it meshes in with the game's building and landscaping system is the cherry ontop! You can do both (building and landscaping) nearly everywhere (but your changes disappear after 2 hours away or so or after server restart) However within the area protected by your flame altar your buildings and landscape changes stay. Thats great. And also that this system naturally makes it possible to build everywhere else without permanently disfiguring the map or disrupting respawns.

Pros:
1. Exploration is rewarding. Even though still in EA, there are so many things to do. Missions, places to explore, loot to collect, armor, weapons, etc. Loot chests are everywhere, even though I sometimes question it cuz keep getting things I don't need/want.
2. The glider. On some recent games, gliding has been a thing, but some other games prefer to stay out of it. Again, it's still in EA but gliding is already flawless. Well, after u unlocked the NPC to make the glider. 
3. Crafting is fun here. Grinding is needed to craft stuff. And what makes it fun, is that after u explore u got some strange new materials, a new crafting system gonna be unlocked afterwards giving options to new and higher level gears. 
4. Already so many build that is quite common to our knowledge. Assassin, Warrior, Tank, Mage, Ranger. But there are some still having questionable or notable worth, like the Beastmaster. I thought Beastmaster would allow me to pet a wolf and make them hunt along my side, but nope. It's not. So let's get to the cons. 

Cons:
1. Lacking variety of enemies. Currently, there's only the Fell as the main antagonist, yet there's also Fell Dragon, Fell bird, Fell... Wraith? Then there's Vukah, some bear looking race. Yeah, it's kinda sad. Hope they add more in future updates. Wildlife is already kinda vary though. 
2. Capped level. Currently the level is capped at 25. No matter how many enemies I killed, I got no more xp. Yet, there's this magic with a level of 27. Sus. 
3. Questionable loot drop. See, in my current lvl 25 enemies hit like a truck. And the lacking drop of health potions is making every battle not only challenging, but a bit dum, really. I mean, a fully armor enemies, some even with huge shield is now quite common and killing them is quite challenging. Then only to be rewarded with the same reward when I faced them when I was level 1 when the enemies are all naked and exposed. What's with that? At least a bandage drop would be fine after taking down such enemies. 
4. Boss fight. Look, I wouldn't suggest a foggy door like the souls series. But Boss arena & Boss loot really need to be treated differently. A little special, if not really special. The Fell wraith boss was also bugged when he's 75% hp. Idk if he was supposed to go to a second phase or something, but when I fought him, he disappeared and... Never show up again. U might wanna fix this. I first came unprepared and he rekt me for good, not knowing that is where the boss dwells. 

There's constructing too in this game, but I don't do that much, so I don't really have much ideas about it. 
Verdict: With some flaws, they already managed to prove that a game in EA is already enjoyable and fun. Hopefully it'll be soon that they'll go full release and giving constant, more frequent updates.",1707933826,1707933826,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The rpg aspect is fine. I really enjoy the skill tree and how you aren't locked into a class tree.
The basebuilding is absolutely fantastic. It has a voxel style which makes it a perfect platform to let your imagination run wild. With voxels come terrain destruction meaning i can simply dig into the side of a mountain and hunker down in there if i want to.
The graphics are good. Not top-tier but good enough to cause you to stop and look around at the beauty.
Enemies are tough to kill. There arent alot of variety to the enemies but there is enough variation to make it fun.
The sounds and music are great. Enough said.

There are no roaming mobs, no attacks on your homestead, and traveling itself is safe as can be as there's hardly any monsters in the world that isn't locked into a spawn camp.

So,  yes, I think the game is excellent and even on this EA phase, its a lot of game. I'm maxxed leveled and combats can still be tricky... and there's some enemy AI janks (I only managed to kill some of the bosses because they got stuck in geometry LOL)... but its all kinda fun. I think combat as a melee guy vs these bosses are little difficult and I've had to resort to archer. Good thing the build class thing is so open.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Best building mechanics i've seen in any survival game so far.
- No carry weight
- Very big fleshed out handcrafted world where there is always a POI around the corner.
- Very good talent tree that makes this game feel alot like an RPG. Skillpoints and build make tons of difference in this game.
- Different grades of gear. From common to legendary. So it feels like there is always something to upgrade.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Combat is way too easy. 90% of my deaths came from fall damage. Which is extremely unforgiving.
- AI pathfinding is bad. This means that if you jump on something, they will just stand there while you kill them.
- The shroud poses no danger. If you relog, you are back at your base and out of the shroud.
- Missing sense of danger. No base defending from enemies. This makes stronger materials for your base pointless and only aesthetic.
-All chests and loot are not shared. So it always feels like you are ninja looting when playing coop.
-All chest and loot respawn after 2 hours. They also respawn instantly when relogging if you play on a private server, and after restarting online server. making it extremely easy to farm gear fast.",1707911370,1707911744,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Hench the I dont recomment it if you are playing it for the survival aspect. The survival aspect is lacking but I dont think they should even name it a survival game at this point. There's some stuff obviously found in survival games (EA Comfort levels , rest buff, building) but none of these are required apart from upgrading your flame.

The game just doesnt click to me. I like survival games, but this doesnt feel like one. This feels like an action rpg with building elements in it (that isnt even required to maintain a even okay base.) and parts of a looter shooter.

I will give probs to the base building aspect. Its quite nice to see parts click and fuse with each other.

But the resource gathering aspect? Goes to slow for me. I love building in video games and while in valheim I did run out of stuff like core wood, wood, stone multiple times, at least I can build more then a few pieces  for a few minutes of work.

Also to note I do not play online.

Oh, and the glider system? Ehh, Costs to much stamina. There's no reason for a glider that goes downwards, to cost you alot of stamina unless you power it down, turn, or try to go up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Positives = it does a few things right such as ease of life standards, no death by food, free repairs, decent combat, respects are reasonable and not overpriced, sleeping still progresses the night even with 1 player but will go faster with more players sleeping, and there is no unnecessary weight system like Conan and others that just slow things down forcing you to waste points in weight management, the skill tree is nice and offers different group tailored play styles, and the environments are beautiful and fun (minus the unnecessary lava pits), and the base building is enjoyable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Negatives = the game forces most items to the ground when gathering such as chopping trees but not mining for some reason? when gathering it should work like the mining and give the materials to the player, the only time it should fall to the ground is if your overloaded, also there is no proximity loot meaning a lot of needless button mashing just to pick up items, also the buttons layout at default is pretty bad but you can change most things through the game and in the steam controller or keyboard setups so it is fixable and i image everyone is changing the odd mapping on default, and you can't hold trigger/R2 to attack you have to mash it repeatedly (also fixable through steam), also you can't at least at my current game progression see at night if you have the torch out you can't have a weapon, just a shield so your forced to fight with a weak torch or drop it and fight in the dark?, there are weapons and shields that have small light sources but they provide no reasonable light source, and my biggest compliant is the red lava on the ground that 1 shots your char!?, in a game where there are cliffs and mountains and your often gliding to your location you can and will often get killed because you could't move out of the way or over an obstacle and fall in the lava and die instantly then your loot with then be put oddly on a cliff or ledge, which leads to the next issue your char slides easily to his death and of course back into the lava while trying to get your items back (face palm), either need an option for your loot not to drop on death in which case no big deal fly back and try again or get rid of the 1 shot unavoidable lava deaths.

The map so far is quite large. It took me days to explore most of it and its clearly hand crafted with interesting points like temples and ruined villages. Judging by the scale of in uncompleted in-game map, this game will be truly staggering in scale once completed.

Combat is reasonably good and is accompanied by an interesting skill tree.

-A few bugs but not enough to be oppressive and nothing particularly game-breaking.
-Damage doesn't display correctly on weapons, it takes some personal testing to see which is actually stronger. (devs please fix)
-Building was fun once you get the hang of it, and felt very flexible... but the cost/time to procure building materials is a big hurdle for expansive builds. We were going to make a pyramid but it would have cost a fortune of resources to use the blocks we wanted. 
-Combat was great from both melee and wizard perspective. It's not so intricate that new gamers might find it hard, but its also not boring. 
-The points you spend in the skill tree feel impactful and many different builds are effective. 
-played solo and with a friend. Both options are viable to play through. Servers can hold a few people, so I wouldn't be surprised if group content was introduced. 
-the default keybinds are weird but customizable. 
-melee only builds struggle with flying foes, especially on rocky terrain.

The gameplay loop while similar, feels better with many QoL features including the ability to fast travel, NPCs, more easily accessible resources, double-jumping (via skill selection) and grappling hooks. The world feels much more vertical and while not pre-generated, is hand-crafted and well designed.

Still in Early Access, so players will likely encounter bugs (I personally haven't encountered any) and there is an issue with progression (basically, you want to travel together when doing quests).

Don't listen to the people complaining about frame drops and then touting their super expensive rigs. I run a 2070 Super with an i7 processor and 16 GBs of ram and the game is fine for me. Didn't even have to drop settings and don't suffer from framedrops or anything. Loading into the game can take a minute, but that's all.

Movement is around the map is fun and pretty quick, given the fact that you can craft a grappling hook to get to marked points and a glider that you can essentially abuse to no end. The map is also a confirmed 9 square miles, so running from place to place isn't bad either. 

 Movement in combat is a little weird on M&K, as you can lock onto targets, but it's not always guaranteed that the next target it auto-locks onto will be the target closest to you. There's been a few times where it's locked onto a target in another room for me, which is weird, but not game breaking. 

Edit: 

So, I've played a little more, and I can say you can honestly pass on this game without missing out on too much. What you will miss out on is incredibly infuriating. 

There is an incredibly steep difficulty curve once you get out of the opening area. Enemies will hit you twice and kill you 90% of the time. It's not exactly fun. The gameplay loop also feels incredibly unsatisfying. I would run my stamina bar out and just sit here on my phone waiting for it to recharge, and I did this for about 45 minutes because I figured I'd need to mine the ore to get a better weapon, which it didn't give me, but now I can about 10 different kinds of plates for decoration. 

You're constantly fighting the same 3 types of enemies, excluding wildlife. And what felt fun during the beta, became a massive slog for me once I put some time in.

Most things feel very poorly implemented/not explained very well. 

I've also now seen major issues with the combat, because out of nowhere, you'll be fighting 20 things at once and the constant issue with the ability to change what you're locked onto is a massive problem with you're going to expect the player to clear out 20 things in one room. 

After they started updating, I started running into the issues that a large chunk of the player population also was running into on launch with constant stuttering and it's gotten so bad that it'll stutter then I'll be 70 meters away from where I was when it started. This usually gets me killed, because it's almost like my screen is freezing, but enemies are still running around doing whatever they want. 

Ultimately, I wish Steam had a ""maybe"" category, because this game is going to end up doing great things, but for now, I don't really think it's worth it, especially after all of the stuff I've seen.",1706411877,1707883339,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

The map is massive, although a significant portion is not currently accessible due to it still being early access. The enemy mobs and first couple of bosses in the starting area made me worry that the whole thing would be essentially story mode, but I was quickly disabused of that notion as I went further afield. Dark Souls it ain't, but certain areas can be reasonably challenging (I played exclusively solo, by the way). The glider is an awesome bit of kit, too. Given the scale of the map, it's almost essential at times. 

The terrain is really craggy (I guess the original population were all wicked good mountaineers) and I frequently found myself staring up at a massive cliff with my objective smugly gloating down at me from the top. Fortunately, I had brought along the trusty pickaxe and had tunnelled my way to the top in short order. This is better done in one go as it turns out, as the terrain appears to reset outside of your base area when you rest or travel a certain distance from it. Not sure how I feel about that, but on the plus side it does mean you don't permanently deface the landscape around your base mining resources. It's probably done to keep the save files from becoming too bloated or some such.

The lore is pretty good. I'd say fairly simple, but I'm used to Miyazaki's method of delivery, so I'm not sure that'd be fair. It is reasonably prolific though, so it sets the atmosphere quite nicely and you soon get a well rounded picture of what happened prior to your awakening.

What it needs (in my humble opinion):

1. Harsher penalties on player character death. You drop consumables and materials at a grave marker, but that's it. It makes saving your old gear or being prepared for this totally redundant. If this was implemented properly, the result would bring a more steady and involved exploration of the massive (and striking) game environment.

2. Base invasions. OK, sure, some people hate it, so make it optional. To me at least, it seems pointless making some massive Game of Thrones-esque hyper fortress when you will be just as safe in a collection of wooden boxes. This is a shame as the building mechanic is truly seamless and tweakable. If this was implemented properly, then the wide choice of building materials, some much harder to farm than others would make a tangible, meaningful difference and add more depth to the play and consequence to your actions, which I reckon is important in any kind of survival orientated game.

3. Limit fast travel. It's too easy, as is. Again, takes away from exploration and makes extending your reach across the map less of a daunting but satisfying task and makes it all seem a bit meh after a while. I mean, anyone who's played Todd Howard's latest creation can tell you all about what fast travel does for your sense of wonder and curiosity, but the less said about that the better, hey?

TLDR: Lovely looking game, which sucks you in hugely until it doesn't. FOR NOW. Early development. The devs have clearly put a lot of love into this one and I think it's a safe bet for the future, especially given the sales so far as they've now got some more loot to throw at it.

I'm fairly sure it's also ignoring AMD Chill setting min/max 30fps.
Never seen anything like it... Bizarre even. This blocks my attempt 
to run this without GPU hitting 70c+ and very noisy GPU fan.
I have 6 case fans. Very clean, well built, excellent air flows.

Brand new PC. Win 11, 8GB GPU RX 580. 64 GB Ram, 8core 3.5/5.2 Ghz CPU. 
Is a slightly pimped desktop not gaming machine but it does?

With RTSS I always game at <50/55c cool and quiet. I will even game 
at 20fps to get this great graphics silent cool gaming sometimes. 
This game apparently says no to such things at the moment.

Graphics are nice
Building is moderatly simple and makes sense

Coop is great

The Weird:
A bit rough around the polish edges and feels too sand boxy at times with no clear goals
Leveling is long and takes a while to get higher level but is quite quick to deliver a ton of early content to the player 
Feels unbalanced and needs some rework for better progression
Glider is very down facing in it's Y axis and you are always forced down too quickly for it to be enjoyable
The enemies are often unclear as to what their lore background or purpose is making game feel detatched

The Bad:
The abilities are not well balanced but you can respec very easily 
Not enough places to use the grappling hook
Not enough enemy types
Combat is repetitive 
Ai is sometimes not very intelligent and can be glitched out
Red zones where you are too low level to get into can kill the player instantly and frustrate you because you don't know if you are supposed to go there or not. Design is not clear of where the player should go and shouldn't go. Restrictions don't make sense.

There seems to be a good amount of content when it comes to exploration or even boss fights. The map is pretty large with towns caves ruins and other stuff around for you to stumble upon and explore, this is nice since it makes the map feel lively and not a empty waste land. The movement in the game feels pretty good for the most part so it makes fighting feel smooth and clean. There are some stuff that i wish was a bit different like base building for example, without going into to much detail it just feels like there are a lot of unnecessary steps that need to be taken to build, in short it could be more simplified. There is also some minor performance issues that seem to occur in some areas of the map, it's not so much FPS loss as it is more of some jitters that start to happen. I also wish that the game was private loot instead of shared loot, this means if you are playing with other people and they loot a chest and take everything from it then you get nothing unless that player shares the loot with you. 


Update: Now that i have done most of the stuff the game has to offer as of right now i do have a few more issues with the game when it comes to specific classes, Archer can be fun but it can also be a pain in the butt and tedious with having to always craft more arrows. Warrior is honestly in my opinion one of the stronger classes and easier to play as it seems more forgiving if you make a mistake. Magic classes seem to be the weaker option oddly as you will not out damage a warrior from what i have noticed and you are obviously very squishy like a archer and you have to constantly matinee your mana. I think there needs to be some tweaks made to some classes to make them less punishing if said things happen. I was surprised when i noticed that there really is not a lot of bosses to fight as of right now in the game, (i am not including mini bosses) i think there is like 6 witch i guess is not terrible but i was thinking there would have been more than that given the size of the map. When you first start playing this game it will feel like there is a lot of stuff to do but honestly i started to realize as of right now there is really not that much to do, it just feels like there is because of how much grind there is to level up/upgrading your flame alter witch is needed to unlock more areas to go into to without instantly being killed due to red shroud. I think the main reason you will get a fair amount of time out of this game is due to many things being locked behind leveling up/upgrading your flame alter.

The Good

The landscape terraforming in this game is top tier, same with the building, seriously the building is so good and if you really experiment with the smallest block shape, you can really make some fantastic builds! The Lighting and shadows are fantastic, very realistic.  Gliders and grappling hooks rock. Exploration is key to advancing and being able to build/craft new items.  Combat can be alot of fun. I personally have an Nvidia 2070 RTX (not the super), on Ultra graphics settings, and this game runs amazingly smooth, no jittering, no lag, no frame rate drop and I have not had a single crash in 84 hours.  Simple truth. 

The iffy?  (it's early access so I won't say bad)

Player characters could use ALOT more customization and could be able to sit in chairs at least?  Seriously what good is a chair if you can't sit in it? Also.. maybe the ability to choose to identify as tall? What's a hobbit without their tall wizard friend? a dead hobbit. 

Some of the armor..  Helmets specifically, look like .. like when you were a kid and your mom, who has not a creative bone in her body, wanted to save money on your Halloween costume and made it herself and now you have no choice but to wear it out of necessity in order to get your candy, no matter how horrible it looks. Seriously, they are that bad.

No weather, at all.  The NPC's talk about building them a house with a roof in order to take them out of the elements. What elements? Where are the elements? Why do you need a roof, it's always sunny, it never snows or rains or storms! It's the perfect weather all year long! 

Lack of water on the map. Not lack of, there is not a single lake, pond, river or even a puddle. Where exactly is my water well getting it's water from? 

Day/Night cycle-  A vast improvement over the demo, I mean..At least there is a small transition now, could still use some work.  

Exploration- The loot can be just...awful..  A lot of the buildings you find are bland on the inside and you find yourself just rushing through things.  The landscape however is very good. It's just not exciting to find another village..camp..ETC. 

By the time I got the final few building blocks, I really lost the need to build anything at all, especially when buildings hardly have a function or purpose. 

Final thoughts- The game is very good as is and fully enjoyable as well as has a TON of potential if the developers listen to the players. Seriously, new additions/changes for the better to this game could make it fantastic!

-As bug-free as you'd expect from a release game.
-Fully designed. There is no placeholders. 
-A huge, detailed, and inventively designed voxel map with lots of hidden gems.
-no procedural design shortcut.
-Missions to keep you busy for days.
-A uniquely detailed building engine. You can make houses and modify terrain with amazing detail. 
-Over 30 Dynamic building block materials that look different if they are placed in different roles (corner, edge, wall, ceiling - it all looks different and they are all gorgeous.

Where the early access state is most noticeable is in somewhat rudimentary class and combat design; the 'stuff' is there but it can definitely use more polish, esp. melee. The crafting and looting balance is slightly askew. Farming could do with some tools. The creature variety is a bit low, but that has a very natural explanation even if they don't improve it. 

The biggest caveat is that, this is a 'post' apocalypse setting. The world has ended. Everyone is dead. There are no towns to visit, no people you meet other than your crafters; everyone you hear of are long dead or monsters. The world seems a bit dead because it IS dead, so if you want interaction with NPC's, that will be fairly limited.

Still, this game is gorgeous, with tons of content, a fascinating story and good gameplay. Right now its greatest strengths is the graphics, the vertical handmade terrain, and the building engine - the basic building blocks the game is built on.

Enshrouded game Math:  40% travel time flying/running + 40% grinding materials + 10% crafting = Give me back my 51 hours.

I am in love with the game.  The Early Access isn't even a factor in my mind, the game is so much better and well developed than any other Early Access title I have seen or played that even if they did not one iota more work on the game I am totally satisfied.  That being said I also play with a small group of friends each of which has their own game that we all join in and help with.  The people I play with have no real issues with the game either.  No game breaking bugs, well only one and that's the Early Access barrier but that's not really a bug so the few graphical glitches that we have see in no way detract from game play.  We have run into a few odd lighting areas while tunneling and twice a pink/purple box that appeared after an enemy died (only poison enemies so far).  With the announcement that the base game concept was not going to change I was given more peace of mind, as I am heartily sick of PvP and games that do not encourage cooperation.  This title brings back the idea of people actually working together to accomplish a goal, and there are no prizes for individuals just for the group effort.  I do not know how the developers came up with an implemented this concept so well that everyone that I have been playing with gets the feeling of a job well done, and it is encouraging actual communication between us.  We have all played other games together (ARK, ESO, 7D2D, Conan, Fallout 76, and many others) and this is the first title where I have felt that we have really synced up well as a team, with no one player trying to out do the others, or just sitting back and letting everyone else do the work and reaping the rewards.  So Kudos to the developers and the the company for coming up with a game that really influences players to work together and talk together.  Would that I could give two thumbs up.  Oh and to the other players that are going to want to comment, please don't try to point out little flaws in mechanics, or if you are not happy with the company politics or management.

It's like a chill dark souls minecraft with the tedious parts of both removed. Graphics way better than you'd think. Building is better than you'd think. Things to find all over, and quests?

More substance, more love and care and more finesse than pretty much any AAA game that's been chucked out recently, knows what it wants to be and what it wants to do, and does it.

At least unless you want to play anything but a mage.
Melee combat is lackluster at best and you better have some souls-honed reflexes to make it, especially with multiple enemies.

Archery is.... let me paint you a picture. You go out, shoot some enemies. It generally takes 2-3 shots to take down a normal, level appropriate enemy. There's A LOT of enemies, EVERYWHERE. In addition, you have a skill that shoots several arrows at once randomly, which seems to shoot 3-5 arrows. So no matter how many arrows you have at the start of  your adventure, they won't be enough, forcing you to port back to base.

Now, put the anger from not completing your objective cause you lacked arrows for the final push aside, and immerse yourself in arrow making.
Spend 20+ minutes hitting twigs with a pickaxe of all things to farm enough twigs
Spend 20+ minutes farming ores for arrowheads (each new tier takes longer to mine)
Spend 20+ minutes chasing road runners all around the desert area for feathers (they are FAST and have absurdly small hitboxes, so good luck spending less ammo than you want to craft lol)
Then spend another 20+ minutes staring at the smelter as it SLOWLY melts your ore into ingots... that is, if you have farmed enough wood beforehand to make enough charcoal to even smelt the darn things.

WHY. What raging sadist thought this would be fun. I spend like 4+ hours of each day just preparing arrows. I'm still not even at max level. Mages have eternal spells that don't need ammo, and they can also craft single use spells rather cheaply. Fighters don't have to bother with that at all and just hack and slash till their weapon loses all durability (and they can easily carry several and half the enemy camps contain a repair bench anyways). Why are archers getting the shaft?

You can only hold so many arrows. Every kind takes a slot and only goes up to 500 per stack.
- you get no arrows and no damage if you miss
- you lose more than half damage unless you hit the enemy into the weak spot
- you are useless without arrows, because you have no base, unlimited ammo. Only craftable ammo
- unlike all other weapons you can't block at all. Good luck backflipping from all the attack bugs
- autoaim (""target lock"") doesn't hit half the enemies by default (shoots under their feet), and doesn't aim for the weak spot, so it actually actively hinders you
- you can't loot arrows off fallen enemies either, so every time you shoot you're losing 1-5 ammo, and you STILL deal less damage than any other archetype
- oh, and if it wasn't enough, ANYTHING in the way stops arrows from reaching enemy. Fence? Leaves? Tall grass? NOPE, arrows don't have enough force to penetrate a leaf, that's also why they don't stagger enemies either even if you unerringly shoot them in the head (there's only some standard random ~10% chance to stagger as with all player attacks), unless they are programmed to shut down (like Fell Wispwyvern when you shoot it during one special animation)
- hawk eye  perk actively hinders you as well, as the insane zoom makes you completely unable to judge distance and seemingly makes arrows 4x heavier so you miss completely most of the time thanks to arrows hitting the ground before making it to the enemy

I bought it mainly because I wanted to try base building, but have just been playing to progress and level my character mostly. I think I just about have everything unlocked now, so I've been getting into that a bit more and it is very nice. It's going to take a little while to get used to, but seems like amazing things can be done with building in this game.

As far as the action and main part of the game goes, I actually thought the combat was pretty tough. I've certainly died a lot, especially as a solo player. Luckily, death is fairly forgiving in this game, keeping all your progress, levels and valuable equipment. Even broken tools and weapons can be fixed quickly at a workbench just by clicking on it. These are nice quality of life features that keep you in the action and take some of the pressure off (which personally, I'm thankful for). Also, setting custom way points for fast travel is very cool and combined with the ability to alter terrain makes for some very interesting ways to get to places, sometimes well ahead of schedule.

Another very nice quality of life feature is being able to reset your skill points for a minor fee. Especially later in the game, when you have amassed some decent equipment and want to try some different play styles or switch to gain an advantage for a specific fight, etc. 

However, I've probably enjoyed the exploration most so far. The map is already large and it looks like they are going to be expanding it by quite a bit still. There are a lot of stunning places to explore. The quests are the ""fetch this"", ""kill that"", ""have a look over there"" variety, but I always enjoyed the journey. The day and night transitions are very beautiful. One interesting thing I've noticed recently is that I haven't seen a body of water anywhere, which seems to be due to the game engine and something they are still trying to figure out perhaps. Either way, I haven't really missed it, the terrain is really cool as it is. 

All in all, I was beyond excited for this to come out and it has exceeded my expectations. In my opinion, especially for an Early Access version, it's incredible. I've thoroughly enjoyed my time in the game and I'm excited to spend more time in building mode now that I'm nearing the endgame.

Yeah it's good, very good. Simply put if you liked Valheim then you'll probably like this.

The main difference for me is this is a heavily *crafted* world. Lots to do and explore and puzzles along the way. Base building is impressive, but you can also 'squat' existing damaged buildings and do them up. The game has a good degree of versatility to it. Would like more automation though, like Satisfactory has machines, Palworld it's Pals, would be nice if you had some 'worker' NPCs to take the chore out of crafting more in mid-game. But don't take these as any real negatives I've played 30 hours in a week and have barely got started on the game and it's not lost any of its interest.

The lighting is really good, the graphics are generally pretty good, some issues with LOD but I guess they'll fix that or allow better LOD settings. Would be nice to have water and weather, but that's what updates are for :-)

Its definitely an issue with the game as of rn i just cant play it, unless i just do soloplayer private. which is a non starter for me and the wife, something is broken in the latest updates.

Another issue is even trying to add direct ip thru server fave tab via steam, it will outright deny its valid IP, or alternatively it will accept the IP only to have it disappear from the list entirely then refuse the same IP it accept moments ago as valid.

once you get lucky enough to win the IP acceptance lottery you're on a crash course thru a gameshow of will it infinite load or not. To which im ashamed to say im a frequent contestant.

The only workaround to finally jumping into a server you're hosting dedicated or paid, is to keep creating new characters, any character that has played in the server prior wont work and youll be stuck looking at the loading screen forever.

I do wish there was a bit more hardcore / survival aspect to it - but given the Valheim / Zelda vibe - i don't see that happening. Played for about 3 hours - enjoyable. Would play again.

UPDATE after ~30h of game play
Game remains very fun and i'm sticking with my ""Zelda meets Valheim"" comparison. It's also fun as a group, which is what the developers were going for. However - a couple of important things new players should understand.

BASE BUILDING is purely for aesthetics and to increase your ""comfort"" level. There are no base raids (like in VH) or threats to your base unless you build one next to an area where a lot of mobs spawn. otherwise, there's zero need for walls/defenses etc. Once you are home - there's zero danger.

THIS IS NOT A ""SURVIVAL"" Game. Despite being tagged a ""survival"" game - this is NOT a survival game. It's an adventure RPG with base building. There's no need to eat, drink, heal diseases, etc. You respawn when you die, and zero loot is lost when you recover your tombstone. So - if you're looking for a ""survival"" game - this is not it.

that being said - i'm still very much enjouing it and will give it two thumbs up.",1706968322,1707843666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I rolled tank, got great armor (so I thought), food buffs, potion buffs, etc. Yet everything feels as though they hit with true damage and armor provides no mitigation. For instance, the melee mobs with green dual wield swords ... they should not be able to 3 shot you when they land hits. The combat in this game is just atrocious. Mobs spam attacks so quickly that to lower your shield to attack just becomes a slog fest and isn't interesting. Weapons can look cool, but don't really seem to do much else. 

You can tell a lot went into the mechanics of the game for world design, terrain, buildings, but it just feels so empty. Chests have differing colors that I would expect would change the quality of loot you find, but nope - grey items. The building and unlocking of recipes to craft is a really cool concept and probably the best done in my opinion, but it just does not feel rewarding enough to want to continue on playing.

It plays a bit like Conan Exiles with better fighting and a much better engine, the character designs are great, they even use the old D&D typeface from games like Eye of the Beholder, which is nice and not lost on me.The levels are thought out well far better than Conan. The graphics and gameplay is leagues above Conan which I put around 90+ hours into. 

The mining gives me some 7 Days to Die, flashbacks but that mechanic is also superior I only miss the Auger.

I suppose the quality of distance view as a setting is currently playing a part in gameplay experience for some, or I am just seeing things in the far distance before my friends on lower GPU cards.

The combat is fun, but I can't figure out how to parry yet, a lack of explanation in the game leads me to have to google it on Reddit before I play this evening. I am sure this will all be sorted out down the line since it's in early access.

The addiction level from Valheim and 7 Days is there. I'm currently living on 4 hours of sleep a night, the Steam Deck being a major cause of the late nights, the ""ill just play quickly before bed"" leads to a 3 or 4 hour detour.",1707836202,1707836202,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

But as it is now, I cannot recommend it.

Enshrouded wants to be Valheim, but fails to understand what made Valheim a success.

- The graphics are not that good (especially in far range).

- The gameplay is clunky.

- Interest points and quests markers on the map is what kills it for me. There's no real exploration, you just go to some place because the game tells you to do so, and then you have to deal with the level design because the devs made sure you've reached a place the way they wanted you to do it.

However it is let down by some performance issues, usual early access teething issues. It's not annoying right now, but I can see the constant stuttering becoming a bit wearing as time goes on if it isn't fixed soon. 

Frame-time remains constant and locked at frame limit for most of the time, however the image stutters occasionally for prolonged periods which can be quite uncomfortable. 

There is also significant performance decrease during sunset too, so I just have to stop what I am doing and wait for the sun to set... not a terrible problem to have as the view is nice! 

There are some other annoying issues like the fact that you can put a limit on items to delete, however you cannot put a limit on which items you salvage and so if you accidentally salvage the item you worked hard to keep, there is unfortunately no way to get it back currently. 

The game feels like a souls-LITE with survival crafting elements. 
Sort of like: Kingdoms Of Amalur had a baby with Valheim. 

So if that sounds interesting to you, then you will enjoy this game.

Notes: 
- I play on a gaming laptop with high settings, on a TV with an Xbox controller.
- I saw Asmongold video, skipped to the end and heard him say he's initially impressed.
- saw my old, old Rust buddy play it, he sang it's praises so I bought it. Played for 1 hour with a random guy and was like whatever this is lame, I wanna shoot dollar store Pokémon.
- after 4 hours of the Palworld servers being hacked, offline and generally buggy I need that survival itch. 
- gave Enshrouded another serious try and then stayed for 13 hours.
- I distinctively remember looking at the clock 00:31, not too bad, oh dang it's 3:26am...wait it's 5am?? Where's my gf? Shit 9am better head out. I missed that first meeting btw.

The fact this game sold 1m and the DAU is consistent and strong during one of the craziest black swan peaks in gaming history, says enough, and I've played solo bar 1 hour. At time of writing, I've played 14 hours maybe and I bought it 21 hours ago. 

Tbh I'm kind of glad that Enshrouded is the underdog in this story, because this game is made by real gamers, what this means is it's fun, at it's core. It's so incredibly fun, not grinding, not a chore, not boring or time wasting. 

Everything is challenging just enough, it may seem daunting and overwhelming and like whatever but please, just stick with it because it's actually so effing simple and everything just makes *sense*

It's such a fun experience, I can have 1 character that floats through different servers and then play on my own game with the same character! Or I can have several for friends, solo and random servers. All I know is I'm definitely going to have multiple character builds, it really is that fun.

It's a mixture of many elements, Zelda series OOT, MM, BOTW, Dark Souls/Elden Ring, Valheim, 7DTD, Shadow of Mordor, Batman AA, The Last of Us, Baldurs Gate 3, Neverwinter Nights, Spellforce 2 and more.

There's an influence that can ONLY be inserted from REAL game players. Yet it's all so new and refreshing, it's not a mechanic, feature, process or play loop that's just been copied and pasted. It's an entirely new experience.

I honestly can't believe this is early access, it's so polished. I'm genuinely impressed, everything about it ticks a box. There's only like a few, very minor annoyances but the resolution to resolve these are so. much. fun. It's so fluid, I haven't experienced ONE BUG. If this is what this studios considers early access, I am so excited for what they do next, not just this title but other games. Really these devs are so talented and I'm so happy for the things they fought for internally (no doubt) there's a stupid amount of ways to solve each problem. Stealth, Magic guns blazing, barbarian Leroy Jenkins, glide in from above like a Viking John Wick, fuck play a moleman that digs under the bandit base and use grenades screaming ""death from below!"" Or ""this is from the crab people"". 

The environment is well designed but there are super annoying things like not being able to climb, grab a ledge or slipping down a hill that has grass and you're like dude..for real. I even ended up gliding into a red pool with no way out that kills you in 10 seconds. And then tried 6 times to get myself stuff back and you're like well there goes my 4 dungeons. Also a lot of stuff resets when you start the game I read which is a very nice feature. Except for the moleman/crab people RPs but we feel for you all, we do. 

At the end of the day those very minor things that are pretty annoying are instantly forgot when you venture back out. And it's effing EARLY ACCESS! If people can forgive Walmart pocket monsters then these are a BREEZE in comparison.

The story also, it's vague enough you use your imagination but explained in such a relatable and compelling way, it actually drives a purpose. It's not some BS that's been thrown in, everything fits together and just when you think it's 1 way it goes another and then an intro to something else. The enemies are actually enemies and sneaky/clever but each have their own culture, which is phenomenal, I did feel a bit bad destroying a tribe of orc, gorilla things, especially when their Shaman came out and tried to heal the dead but you know, big teeth and scary growls, I'm here to save my world. I keep finding new enemies and not just different colours, I'm definitely still early game at 14, or so hours. I usually refuse to buy a game that's on the sale but for the amount of hours I'll get out of this, it's got to be single digit pennies per hour.

It's such an amazing concept, viking, zombie, magicians genetically bred with science and gods like some fucking Captain Scandinavia experiment but awakes to a post apocalyptic, medieval Book of Eli/Mad Max/I Am Legend type shit, hell bent on reclaiming and repopulating what was lost. And it.just.fucking.works..I'm serious at no point have I been like ""yeah right buddy"" more like ""well yeah maybe""

I'm waiting to get bored, honestly I am. Steam says I have a 20% completion rate, but when you get bored of 1 thing you switch up the game entirely. 

What a few hours could be:
Oh I'm bored of farming for resources, I'll go and take out a boss, meh tired of fighting let me expand the base, ok may as well upgrade some gear, ok let's go questing, oh let's check this area out, NOPE should of upgraded more stuff, maybe I can dig a hole and bait the..wow nice and a quick grenade, wtf is this purple thing I picked up? Let me see what it does, oh it's used to make this...neat, but I need this thing from that monster...didn't I see one back in that place? Let me check, oh I'm lost, wow is this a castle? Bandits? It's my castle now, let's move everything here, huh that was easy, ok let's find everyone a bedroom, need to repair this building, I wonder if I can put this wall her..wow ok that's pretty cool, I can make a secret what?? oh wow I can make that? No way...damn let me organise my chests, ok stop pressing X this isn't Palworld I keep punching these bloomin boxes, where was the potions? Ah and the food goes next to this oven, finally the weapons should go...can't believe I just threw a grenade at this blacksmith...and ruined my castle walls..well a quick wall and...it'll be fine I guess, wait can I make that environmentally designed rubble hole a doorway? Oh wow it fits...damn this game is insane. Better make some farmland, oh a new quest, puzzle tower? Maybe later, but I do want to glide over there... maybe later, I need to take that guy out first, let me upgrade farms first, I need good soil, oh there's some..wait...wtf is this a buried chest? Oh nice a new weapon, huh, not as much power but this stat is 2x better, maybe I should get this armour instead to balance dmg...oh I need to get this ok, well let's go to the tower, just need to prep some stuff, huh let's go on a big resource farm....

The loops are so fucking good, if I were the developers I would be so effing proud of this game.

The reward loops are incredible, bravo to whoever designed these mechanics. There is logic and magic and RP and adventure and loot management and resource management and everything is just so...easy to understand.

I saw Asmongold give a short intro review, I saw friends play it, I saw 1m copies sold and very strong DAU. I said f it, I was getting so tired of Palworld problems.

Palworld sucks, it's fun as a novelty but it's clear the Devs are in over their head, servers always down, buggy, hackers, progress deleted after a day. DAU is dropping. I'm kind of disappointed the exposure that gets over Enshrouded but tbh, succeeding despite that shows me more.

Look, this isn't a Rust style builder, it's a bit tricky and tbh I love base builders. But then I saw a video about taking over existing structures in the game, for example taking over a bandit base and declaring castle Mascot, the spearhead against the Shroud.",1707829229,1707829229,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

+ Combat is simple but tight.
+ The map is dense with things to find and secrets to uncover
+ There's a ton of character build diversity
+ The building tools are best in class
+ Equipment all looks pretty good

- Some character builds are so far ahead in power-level solo players sorta have to be wizards
- Building materials require far too many resources - It makes solo players grind for hours if they want to build
- Fast-travel points are few and far between which leads to a lot of annoying corpse runs

Why  : 

-Ui and inventory is such a mess just looking at your inventory and building stuff is overly complicated and non - intuitive

-Movement : It's hard to explain it but the way your avatar move is very bad and OMG the glider is so clunky compared to Breath of the wild THE GLIDER IS HORRIBLE

-optimization : I have a 2080 ti with a aw3423dw dell screen 4k and the game look SUPER bad and runs like shit. Given that 2080ti for 4k is a bit weak I can run other recent games very well,

-seems like other people liked the building system I didn't like it at all. it's clunky at best.

So Good",1707811688,1707811688,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,True
1203620,158214085,76561197970793447,1446,4,2856,33,2856,1707767773,"TL;DR - A mediocre adventure game with some interesting build options. Probably a sideways thumb in its current state.

It advertises itself as a survival game, but there's very little of that here. It's a bog-standard 3rd person Zelda-ish action-adventure game with resource gathering and a couple of Valheim's mechanics, namely using food as buffs vs sustenance, and the comfort/rest system, and those are pretty fitting for a game of this type, but you'll never starve, or suffer from exposure, as there are no weather effects whatsoever. You can't even drown, since there are no bodies of water anywhere on the map. 

On that front, it's hit or miss. The map has tons of POIs to explore, and the teleporting and wingsuit are pretty helpful in getting around, as there are no mounts. You can also dig out tunnels and bore through hillsides. But the world seems mostly dead and empty, and looks bland. The grappling hook is fun, but there's few places where you can actually use it.

There's very little enemy variety, and what there is, is disappointingly banal. Zombies, barbarians, zzzzz.... I guess the giant ewoks are kind of original.. AI is nonexistent, and most enemies have comically long attack animations. You usually just have to sidestep the first attack, then you have what feels like 10 minutes to administer a beatdown while your opponent is putting a flourish on his swing-and-miss. 

The shroud, which the game centers around, is also a disappointment. The entire challenge of it is simply stacking handicaps on the player: There's limited routes in/out, you can't teleport, you can't linger, you can't build in it, and you have limited visibility. The baddies there aren't any harder to kill other than just being harder to see. The constant fog in the shroud also serves to make every battle in it look and feel the same. It'd be OK for a mission or two, but half the game? Ugh. The shroud timer feels lazily tacked on too, like something WildCard would've come up with.

Enshrouded fares much better on the building side of things, where they give you a very generous amount of styles - around 2 dozen at least, as opposed to the 3-5 you normally get with these games. They all look quite good and blend well together. You can also edit the building pieces block by block - very unique and allows for lots of detailing for facades, windows, etc. You can also take over/merge with abandoned village buildings, which is very cool. The one huge downside to building is there is no way to make angled walls. 90 degree Minecraft style is all you get. 

The entire building system appears hard-locked to a 4-directional grid, and every piece has to face N,S,E,or W. You'll likely get your first taste of this when you try to make a hobbit hole in the side of a hill and can't get the door on straight because you didn't make the hole face one of the four cardinal directions. But you can at least carve out a cavern and build inside it, which is pretty awesome. 

Building is the one category where this game actually shines - unfortunately, there's very little reason to do so. There's no weather and no raids on your base. There doesn't appear to be any statistical difference between the building sets either - a wood hut is just as sturdy and provides just as much shelter as a steel house. If it weren't for your craftsmen demanding a roof over their heads, there'd be no real reason to build a base at all beyond some crates and workbench on a stone slab.

The game has a single player mode, but it's of the halfassed ""PVE but by yourself"" variety, and comes with all the attendant nuisances, like being unable to pause when real life calls, and every thing resetting (including holes you've dug) when logging out. Even the shroud roots - the things you as the [strike]Dragonborn[/strike] [strike]Starborn[/strike] Flameborn are supposed to be cleansing this world of, keep hilariously coming back after logging out. According to the devs, this is to allow the non-existent people you're not playing with to have a chance at them.

Technically, it feels quite stable. No crashes or glitches. 

So yeah, there might eventually be something here, but it clearly needs another year or two in the oven. Standard for an EA title I guess.",1707811171,1707811577,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I wasn't going to write this review until I finished the game's progression, but since this is a game that is essentially made for my preferences, I felt like I need to put down my first impression, as it's surprising.

The game is boring. I don't know exactly what it is about the game that makes it hard to play, but I'm the type of person that will get into a game and play for 18 hours straight, then wake up and play for another 18 hours. With this game I can't play for more than a couple of hours before I start getting tired or wanting to play something else.

This game has EVERYTHING that I love, and honestly I'm amazed that I'm not addicted to it. I love survival crafting games like Ark, Myth of Empires, Valheim, conan, Atlas. I love RPGs and soul-likes. I love sandbox building and resource management. Yet the game has something missing, or feels off to me. Admittedly I'm only 10 hours in at level 12, but I SHOULD be interested by now, and I'm not.

If I had to guess, I think there are 3 main factors as to why I'm not really enjoying it.

1. The word feels sparse and un-challenging. Loot is garbage.

I run around for a while, find a ""tomb,"" and go kill 3-4 skeletons that take 4 hits each and get some mediocre loot. I run through a large shrouded area, face a few zombies, bugs and a miniboss, all of which I kill very easily. I go to a tower and do some uninspired puzzles. I've fought bosses and different enemy types, but I feel like my biggest enemy is stamina more than anything. The combat system definitely needs more interest and challenging enemies, as well as more expansive dungeons or variety of enemy types. The loot is also pretty awful and uninspired. I've seen the same weapons 100 times, and can complete entire dungeons for the same green bow I saw hours ago in a random chest. This MIGHT be a big source of my dissatisfaction with the game now that I think of it. There's no excitement for new loot.

2. Early game gathering and crafting is too resource intensive, or not clear.

I know later in the game that it becomes more streamlined, but early on, I spent a good chunk of my time infinitely mining stone, cutting wood and desperately trying to find metal scraps and plant fibres to get the basics set up. This took way too long and was really not clear, when it came to metal scraps. On top of that, logistics in the base is difficult (until you get magic chests) having to work with different chest inventories and trying to find the materials you need for crafts between balancing what you already have in your inventory. This isn't a major issue or big difference between other survival crafting games, but I feel this one does a particularly bad job of it.

3. Progression and traversal are kinda weird.

The movement in this game is a bit odd, with the grappling hook only working on specific points and stamina being an overwhelmingly negative experience with things like sprinting and climbing or gathering. On top of that, a lot of movement and traversal skills in the skill tree should be base abilities, or just level-locked without requiring you to invest into a tree. The game feels so limiting without double jump as default.

All in all, iot's hard to really pinpoint what's wrong with this game and why I'm not having as much fun as I feel I should. I'm going to force myself to play more and hope more progression and levels reveals something to me, but otherwise I'm unimpressed by what should be an impressive game. If I look at all the mechanics and descriptions of this game on paper, with deep crafting, an open world, voxel terrain and RPG mechanics, I would be desperate to play. But it just feels off playing it.

I will come back and edit this review after another few dozen hours or when I finish the game.

END GAME REVIEW:

As I said, I went on and ""completed"" the game, by getting to max level and crafting/beating everything. At 55 hours, this isn't a ""bad"" game. Everything I said in the first impressions still stands, but with a few caveats.

As you progress through the game, you get SOME enemy variety, but it's in the form of regional variety. Within a region you will face pretty much the same enemies start to finish. The bosses are re-used as well throughout.

The balancing of crafted gear, pacing of unlocking crafting recipes, and loot from chests is all over the place. I unlocked a beehive to produce honey at lvl 23, long past when I'd already found a better way to produce stamina buffs.

The crafting system is a mess. They really need to streamline all the different benches, stations and accesories you need, and what is crafted at each one, as well as the ability to pull from magic chests across all crafting, not just at NPCs. Inventory and resource management in this game is a nightmare when it cdomes to crafting and you end up with stuff all over the place.

The loot never gets better. It's just as underwhelming as earlygame, and the ""endgame"" is loting the same chests over and over praying for pieces of armor or interesting weapons.

The combat is as bland as it was at the start of the game. I unlocked a couple of ""interesting"" additions, such as a dodge leap and a short dash, but thats about it for variety. The game start to finish is spam attacks, and dodge the same 2-3 attacks enemies have. Shoot arrows, use spells (wands or staffs). The magic system is interesting, but it's beyond busted right now with wands and the poison spell with staffs. Archery is a pain to farm for arrows and gets messy against groups of enemies.

The map is far too big for whats there, whether this is hand crafted or not, 70% of the map is just padding running space.

So yeah, I finished the game, I don't want to play it anymore. I might check it out if they release a major update, but other than that, this game was kinda lame.",1706711073,1707810395,False,10,0,0.493816345930099487,0,True,False,True

As an early access game it's a damn good one!! The way I see it I paid a sub premium price for a premium game that just works for what it was born from... A small team of friends that had a well over done concept and they just made it better. My only con with this game is a small one but the fact it is fueled by quests witch means it has an end, at some point you will run out of quests. What is the end game!?! With 130+ hours of play and my only glitch has been NPC enemies getting stuck in the ground (just hit the ground on em with a pick gets em out), and a hang up once in a while that ends up lagging me into some crappy situations. ""not sure if this is game or PC related"" but it has gotten me in some pretty harry situations that took more time than wanted to get out of... The graphics are amazing. The mechanics smooth. Magic is well done between staff and wands. Melee and melee/shield combat is nice, minus duel wielding that would be cool, two hand weapons can use some work with more varied animations and more attack types maybe. Crafting is very complex in a very simple way. Farming is a grind as with many craft/builder games but can be over looked with the massive open world side tracking one into many troublesome situations of ""whoa WTF is that!! and Hold my beer!!"". It's just kinda nice to have a survival builder that kinda walks you through, without forcing you to ad-hear to an on-rail type system, to eventually have a full on town built by you, complete with NPC you can interact with. I can see in the future many expansions making this game endless with content but for now it does have an end it's a matter of when you choose to see that end.. P.S: I use a controller,an MSI/Xbox  control pad. It works fully well!! It's really nice to have such an involved game and be able to sit back and enjoy it not hanging over a keyboard and dealing with a mouse.",1707804607,1707804607,True,1,0,0.503816783428192139,0,True,False,True

Negatives:

- Atrocious Inventory split stack method/management
- No auto pickup
- NPCs shared...
- No ingame chat
- Crafting system Time gated.
- Movement kills you more than gets you places.

- Floor is lava, and shroud (not the OG CS Pro but can and) will insta kill you instead of slowly damaging when time runs out.

- 15$~20$ feel--(alot of the game is obviously a mix of assets and pre-made animations)
- High RAM usage
- DLSS/FSR looks like.... blur
- Some enemies are... annoying
-Takes too long to terraform outside base
- climbing mechanic not implemented
- Bad if  you have no friends.. too tedious by yourself imo

Positives:

+ Terra-forming.
+ Base upgrades/Building system
+ Boss Fights.
+ Loot, with alot of variable stats.
+ Great Stability so far.
+ Skill tree, needs work but its there~
+ Fun with friends~ Especially if they die to slip and slide/loony toons explosives
+ Well made map and locations.


Neutral:

! Puzzles can be annoying to die to.



(I've been more annoyed 50% of the time in some stupid lava floor deaths... due to slipping down a slopped edge and accelerating at incredible speeds from 2 Meter heights)

(The Tedious Time gated crafting you go to get prerequisites to craft,Which isn't fun and kills my enjoyment since I spent like 1hour to get to a zone and mine, to come back and wait another half hour for all the items to... finish crafting so I can make a Bronze Axe/Pick)

(Crafting system is mobile phone like, Falling is velocity based and not height based. so it... can randomly end your will to play)

(I would enjoy being able to climb on walls similar to other open world titles due.. to not being able to pull myself over a face height wall so I dont slide into Death)

--- One of those games that you might want to wait for a sale due to.. the state of the game until furthur notice---

I just wanna finish the available content just to see if its due to the lack luster progression 
that leaves a bad impression so far..

its an okay concept and alot of the world is made and managed well but its missing more than it has~(the game overall)

As someone that enjoys building games, I spend hours on that feature alone. This game is great for that and the game loop is rather enjoyable as well. The map is huge with a lot of beautiful and dynamic areas to explore.

That said, there is not much threat in the game at this time. Your base will not be attacked, weather is superficial, eating is not necessary to survive, and you keep all your on death (you do drop your inventory). Only one boss so far has posed any form of a challenge. I am hoping as the game goes on, events might be added such as base raids or something along those line.

1. Let's start with the HUGE face palm moment.
IT IS NOT A SURVIVAL GAME!!! there are ZERO survival elements to the game. NO NPC, NO Beast or MOB threats. NO Environmental THREATS. NO Thirst or Hunger nothing. there are ZERO and I Mean ZERO survival elements to the game. 
2. The world and map, While mid sized, the fast travel 100% negates any and all elements of threat and danger to the world. The world while it looks amazing, feels empty and void of any kind to soul.
3. Bosses and Boss fights. while the bosses are unique, they all 100% pose 0% danger to the player as the ""CHEESE"" is real in the game. every boss fight can be so cheesed that a level 5 player can 100% the game without needing leveling up in order to fight a boss.
4. the Building is a sad parody of what a real building system is. The block choices are so limited you might as well just build a box and enjoy. With the ""FAILURE"" to put in any type of stability system, the building feels less fantastic and just, sloppy regret after a frat party. 
5. Looting, while enjoyable for the first hour, you quickly find the the loot table is very limited, and zone based, not player based. ""INSERT --- CHEESE"" I found that a level 3 toon could cheese the building system to a max level zone, drop a flame alter, and begin the ""CHEESE FARM""- Logout / Login method of farming the best weapons and gear with out a single threat to the player. 
In conclusion.. Enshrouded is a game for players that are to afraid or just incompetent in there skill to play a true survival game. However with that said, the game does and can provide a player many hours of ""SAFE"" comforting game play. One where ZERO skill and or forethought are required. Enshrouded is the GOLDEN COWARD game for the ""Everyone gets a trophy"" type player.

I especially like that the world is handcrafted and not generated.  

Spoilers ahead maybe: Some of my negative feedback for early access is that the enemies get repetitive and the world feels dead and lonely after a while.  There are no living humanoid NPCs in the world except the few that you add to your base. Its just the same undead enemies, bugs, and animals over and over all throughout the world.  I expected to go find the survivors struggling to survive out in the world, but instead they are all found in a tube and then summoned into your base...

I also grew tired of the exploration simply because it was always a pain in the butt to find some of the points of interest on the map.  You constantly run into cliff walls and insta-kill lava and spend 10 minutes trekking along the side of a mountain to find a path. This gets even more frustrating when you add in limited vision and a timer that instantly kills you after a certain amount of time (shroud).  I think whats needed is to show the roads on the map so you can figure out where to go because you usually don't remember even if you've explored it. Chests also get repetitive and are usually just full of garbage.  

Overall I think we need roads on the map and more types of enemies and npc's.  Including living humans to bring some life to the world.  I'm still trying to play, but I lost most of the will to explore after the pillars of creation.  Just too much fog and walls and frustration with points of interest randomly being either above or below the platform.",1707788059,1707788163,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Combat is vapid and extremely unbalanced - where ranged or magic attacks render nearly everything trivial and melee is both under powered and mildly jank, as the window for parries is strangely long before they swing (you can parry in the first frame of their movement).
The world is large but uninteresting. I know it's a hard ask these days, but bigger isn't always better. I would prefer a smaller map if it meant that it would be more engaging to explore.

For example, when I die and drop my items, I have little to no interest to trek back to the place I died. Unlike other survival games where I feel both a pressing need to retrieve those things and to continue exploring the place I was in - this game lacks in making me feel either of those things.

If you're a fan of rewarding exploration and fantastic base building then definitely worth a purchase. 
The enshrouded mechanic makes exploring ruins and finding gear just a little more intense and though at a glance it seems uninteresting, it grew on me fairly quickly.

For what it is, there's a whole, fairly bug free experience that's pretty top tier.

The core gameplay is simple but solid, the base building is in depth and satisfying and the world is interesting and fun to explore.

The combat itself feels skin deep and somewhat lifeless at first, which is unfortunate because once you've unlocked interesting combat skills it can be fairly fun if you don't mind the fairly braindead AI. 
I personally had to unlock the evade attack, grievous strike and jump attack to find combat more engaging.
I'm hopeful that the developers will expand upon the combat system and AI in the future because the foundation is there.

Another trouble you may have as a fresh player is the intensity at which enemies will scale in different areas, it can be a headache and extremely discouraging. Exploration of ruins in search of good gear is all I can reccomend!

Here I mention the aspects I like, after it I mention the aspects which could be improved:

+the design of everything is really well and the atmosphere, also the sounds are really atmospheric
+the world looks interesting to discover and motivating to find needed materials and do your quests
+the buildings feels nice and all the things you can use like potions are useful
+improving your base is also motivating

-the pickax always does an extra hit even if I stop using it, this should be changed, also moving while using the pickax, the same with other tools.
-the fighting and blocking has some problems: as example you need to wait till the animation is finished and you cannot move or do different actions like in other games. especiall against fast enemies you have only one way to fight: using bow or block&attack. With slow weapons this is very annoying because the attack animation is very long and if you trigger two times accidently it is also frustrating.
-some places are very empty, just wide grassland without anything
-in some cases it doesnt trigger the block with a shield and I need to press another time. Especially after an attack from me this happens often.
-slopes in the miasma and also other slopes are very slippery without any recognizable reason.
-a survival option would be nice with need to drink&eat
-forcing players not to go in high level areas with the red miasma is in my opinion not so good. The player should have the possiblitiy to go everywhere from the beginning if he try hard.
-I miss so many nice skills in the skill tree like fast running(uses much stamina), jumping higher, climbing at rocks, teleporting to enemie or to another position, invisibilty for a specific time, dodging in the air, slow motion focus mode, flying mounts and horses, better sneaking mechanics a.s.o.",1706407372,1707773033,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I loved Valheim, but it was missing some components, like interesting POIs and more mobs. Enshrouded has the feel of Valheim, but with improvements all the way around. It almost feels like Minecraft 2 with the amount of freedom you have. 

There are certainly some things I miss in the game. There is currently no water. This is mostly explained away by the Shrouded taking its place. I would still appreciate there being water, but I understand the limitations of a voxel-based engine. Currently, there are no mounts or tames, however you can have an animal follow and guard you on a limited basis with the Beast Master perks. I also get that with the glider there really is no need for mounts, but as a survival game enthusiast, I still want them. 

Overall, the game is a lot of fun, and it is still only in early access. But, for being an early game, it feels very polished. The graphics and ambiance is fantastic. There certainly is room to grow, but even as is, I would rate it at least as high as Valheim, if not higher. The building is not as easy but is more nuanced and immersive.

You can build uniquely in your own style. Plenty to discover, and lots of enemies to kill, although there are only a limited amount of different enemies and bosses for the moment. 

You can completely play this solo or with friends, lots of classes to explore, It also uses a valheim saving system, so you only need to create one guy if you dont want to start over, playing with friends or on a public server. 

great looking vistas, fun way to travel around, really fun and easy building system, voxel world, great soundtrack to get you into the mood, and lots of lore to discover through questing.

I've tried em all, starting with Minecraft and going through Ark, to Valheim, etc...  None of them really grab me long term.  The sandbox nature is cool and all, but the ""brutal"" survival types just feel too tedious to me.  Enshrouded hits the survival part perfect, imo... You don't NEED to constantly be eating/drinking, but if you do it gives you various temporary boosts.  You don't HAVE to build a whole settlement, you can just take over the ruins of one and fix it up.  

But that's not all, there's a pretty darn good open world action-rpg baked into this, while sometimes feeling a little sparse in areas (more NPC's, some just ""survivors"" wandering or able to be placed to ""live"" in your settlement would be neat, fishing would be awesome...) it's pretty impressive for Early Access.  Each of the NPC's that are in the game give you crafting abilities at your base.  There are five total so far, Farmer, Blacksmith, Hunter, Alchemist, and Carpenter.  They each have a multitude of quests to recover items they lost, find equipment and other survivors, etc.  There are Towers like most open world games which give you fast travel high points, dungeons/crypts, caves, scavenger camps, all sorts of stuff to explore and find.  The world is already impressively big, and there is more to come!

Character progression is also top notch and easy to refund points to play around with various builds.  Soooooo many options to choose from, and you aren't limited at all by ""class"".  There are various pieces of armor and different types of weapons, at various rarity levels (up to legendary) just like what you would expect from an action-rpg like Diablo etc.  The better the quality, the more it can be upgraded by an NPC.  

It all comes together so well, even having to venture into the shrouded areas (where at start, you can only survive up to 5 minutes before dying) which can be maze like and easy to get lost.  After playing around with the systems though, the entire survival part even plays into that by being able to build bases or at least a basic respawn point near where you are attempting to quest.  Or even better, can't find a way up that mountain?  Build a flame, and start building stairs right on up.  After 20 or so hours and wanting to rage quit at times trying to play it more like a straight action-rpg, it really started to come together for me that the survival game really worked well with the rpg side, and at times the two seem very well designed to be utilized together.  Take your pickaxe and chip away platforms to stand on, build a cave and a shelter near a tough area so you don't have to keep walking back, or maybe you find an area with a wealth of stuff to harvest and/or explore, so you build a full base with farm and NPC's to craft anything and everything you need.  It's honestly just amazing and I can't see the genre going anywhere else from here.  In comparison, Palworld feels directionless beyond the ""catch em all"" gimmick.  Granted the Enshrouded story isn't going to win any awards (it can be vague at times, although interesting, and is told via books and scrolls found, mostly), it's leaps and bounds above many others in the world-building aspect which really helps to draw you in longer term.

I have only had one crash in 65 hours of gameplay.  It runs on my base Rog Ally and my Dell XPS (with a GeForce RTX 3050) just fine at Balanced settings 1080p.",1707762898,1707762898,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It has the makings of a great game, but it's just too early. There are no real mods for it, and given that the devs
use their own engine mod development will be slow at best. Why does it need mods, you ask? Because there are so many obnoxious things in place. 

Building anywhere: Completely false. While the building is very good, its not valheim good, and where you
can place ANYTHING is limited to a square around your base teleport. This gets larger as you progress, but it's still very annoying. Furthermore, ANYTHING YOU DO IN THIS GAME OUTSIDE YOUR BASE SQUARE WILL RESET. When the game is closed, or over time being away from that area in game, everything resets to its
original state, except what is inside your base area. This means you can't dig a tunnel or build stairs somewhere and it still be there later. Only in your base will anything you do persist.

You also are very limited in WHERE you can place your base bonfire in the first place. Climb those beautiful snowy mountains in the background? Cool. Can't place a base there, though. Actually there is a line around the gameworld that if you cross it, you get killed/teleported back. 

I understand the shroud is basically a core mechanic of the game, but frankly its REALLY annoying in a building game. You can sort of fight off the shroud by killing the roots, but not completely enough for it to 
be worth talking about, and they respawn like everything else anyway. There is also no water...? Again that ties into the shroud's story, but water in a building game is kinda... well its awkward not having any lakes, creeks, rivers, etc in the entire game. 

I can go on, but the point is thus: There are way too many arbitrary limits on what you can do, and no mods currently exist to bypass them. You can play this and enjoy it for awhile, but its not going to be replacing any of your staple building/survival games in its present state. (Feb. 2024)

Frankly i'm pretty disappointed, because when I first started playing it was amazing. But the obnoxious limits show up one after another and eventually get on your nerves. It's quite frustrating.

While I would agree in part, I didn't play those games. With the exception of Breath of the Wild, I didnt take time to play these games because of the graphics. With Breath of the Wild, it's just not system. But Enshrouded Brings the best of these games together as well as a one more classic in the story line and combat, Fable. 

I don't read every book that I open I have enough to understand the plot of the kingdom fall and that's enough.  One critic I would give is that the NPC should have been voice acted when they are the ones giving the quests. But other than that Its just enough to keep me engaged and not want to do anything else.  

The combat is basic at the beginning but as new skills like Blink are unlocked, I have been able to fight in more complex ways, diving into a horde enemies near a shroud root and come out of it the victor. This is what gives me old school Fable vibes and I love it. Fighting and adventuring is so much fun and I cant wait to see the rest of Embervale and the enemies new zones will bring. 

I have had problems with the farming while this is in early access. Particular with a patch of mushrooms that are appearing back above the soil when something else has been planted in the mushrooms place. I even but down a terrain block (Rough Stones) and the mushrooms appeared, poking out the top of the stones. 

Now that I'm at the end of the quest line with just a just a hand full of quest left to complete, I understand why the map is so large, it needs to be. I am hopeful for a few additional NPCs at full launch. Such a one of the commanders in the lore.

I have recently gotten into the Survival and Survival-Adjacent genre of games, and although I've heard that this game isn't really considered a true survival game for most, It is still a great game in its own aspect. The game play hasn't gotten boring or repetitive for me even with the build I am currently running. And exploration in this game is something that is always rewarded it feels.   

The building mechanic is really nice, but, I wish there were a way to easily make circular builds. Maybe there is and I haven't discovered it, but that's my only complaint with the building. 

The combat is simple but fun. At first I didn't think I was going to like the magic aspect of this games combat because the staff spells use ""ammo"" that is crafted of found in the world. But, the damage they do more than makes up for the minor inconvenience of not having  access to an infinite version of a given spell early on. Which, in hindsight, is a great way to prevent the game from being too easy for magic builds. 

Cant speak much on the melee combat or ranged combat that isn't magic. One of my friends is running a tank build and is seeming to enjoy it a lot. 

This game is a lot of fun and is loaded with content for an early access title, and it is likely to be getting a whole lot more content and features. All in all, I recommend buying this game.",1707753997,1707753997,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- Incentive to explore! I like the quest/lore system but there is no reason to explore. A chest inside a cave has the same contents as an easy to reach chest that you can spam loot. There should be fixed chests that contain unique recipes.

- Incentive to kill enemies! I was avoiding mobs a lot, especially after hitting level cap. Loot tables need to be spruced up. V Rising is a great example, farming enemies felt worthwhile, especially with Paper IE discovering recipes.

- Incentive for Comfort Level! You can extend your Well Rested buff up to 2 hours with max Comfort Level but its pointless. No one is going to be away from their base for more than 30 minutes. I'd suggest extending food duration with Comfort Level.

It took me 100 hours to feel like I completed this game, a third of it building. Its amazing that indie games are half the price and twice the fun than Quadruple A games (even in Early Access!)",1707744068,1707744068,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The shroud remind me a lot about Dark Zone in division and the surface of Metro 2033.
Survival Timer in these shrouded zone give a good sense of emergency but not urgent enough to be annoying.

The developers also respect your time by allowing very forgiving fast travel.

The zones and POI are unique enough to keep me hooked, it's always about one more unlock and one more zone to explore and one more chest to open.

The Zone is extremely massive. It's like playing Elden Ring again.

Some things i like:
-Crafting is adequate which is a lot to ask for in the modern era of gaming, however the system has Arbitrary 
restrictions and requirements as well as methods to establish crafting stations.
-Building is actually really good although snapping leaves much to be desired and there is a lack of items
showcased by other game. Most of the items are just re-skins of the same object.
-Exploration is very nice, however not being able to climb is a massive downside since it's now considered industry standard.

Some things i don't like:
-Combat is incredibly inconsistent and feels unfair, that being said it's not difficult it just doesn't feel consistent
most enemies are the same ones with higher HP and that's never good for any game when increasing difficulty.
-Hitboxes are unfair, i can't hit a flying enemy despite being right in front of me and my sword actually moving through the target. However if i double jump over a Grounded Enemy it can still hit me while swinging straight in front of it despite my character being a meter above it and behind it. now correct me if I'm wrong but i was under the impression this was an active combat system not a dice roll system like Morrowind. 
-Melee Combat feels bad, you get staggered with every hit, but enemies can't be staggered and there is no possible way to circumvention this.
-Backstabbing and stealth are essentially pointless after around two hours due to the developers idea of increased difficulty being ""give it more HP and ATK. someone from Bethesda must have been in charge id difficulty balance.
you can no longer kill enemies with stealth, back-stab, crits, etc; and once you shoot one enemy, all the enemies in the vicinity will immediately know exactly where you are and will charge you at mach speed.
-Tank is a pointless class since your Hp is negligible at best given the ""difficulty"" disparity of the game. And the fact that as well as every other class the tank is incapable of actually mitigating staggering, which means not only do you kill slower than every other class, you attack slower, can't stagger, are staggered, and will be surrounded so the Hp boost from CON is pointless.
-Melee in general is bad, every melee class suffers more or less from the same shortfalls as the Tank does. although to a lesser degree.
-There is no progression other than gear
-The game feels incredibly Empty, i get that it's a survival game but that being said there is no purpose for the game itself to feel so empty other than old abandoned encampments and hostiles. 
not a single cannibal wants to talk to me :(

The game could be worth it if they continue to fix it and completely overhaul combat
but until then i'm struggling to enjoy this game, and not just go right back to Palworld.

Gameplay is nice and flowing while you level up.

Good point you can progress with-out the need to do all side quest, you can even ignore side quest to progress which is a good point.
You can easy obtain anything you want from scraping houses or jars, the only moment you really need to ""farm"" is when you upgrade your house flame.

The only downside of the game for me :
The game is really too easy when you play with friends. I have played in duo and with 3 mates, bosses aren't a difficulty. (Probably also because i have the experience from many games so my difficulty exceptation are too high) I would have loved the possibility to change the game difficulty for that.

But still dungeons & enimatics seems a little bit too low in difficulty, even if they look incredible and some are really well made, you enter inside and at the end unlock a way to exist very fast. Which can looks like a small thing but its very important.
The only dungeons we saw getting harder are the ones around level 30 with some decent enigmatics.

I'd love to see more harder dungeons and enigmatics, even if they are side quest just for loot instead of main quest !

Looked great when I saw others playing it, but when I tried it myself I just felt bored to the bone. Lore is not ingenious, but I liked it and that's about it. All other mechanics, besides movement and acrobatics, are very medium. There are some basic melee combos. Melee is very skill based, since the parry window is so small, you are better off dodging attacks. But stamina is scarce and you have to retreat regularly to recover while fighting a mob. Bows are underpowered and arrows are a chore to make. Magic is the clear winner, as elemental damage seems to be the strongest. It is also the cheapest and fastest way to progress, as you can easily kite enemies, saving a lot of heals, time, and using the wand for ranged attacks for free. 
Small enemy variety and enemy loot scaling is bs. You getting the same loot for the same enemy, but higher level. Questing is standard, go there and discover, and the rewards for quests are minuscule. Not even worth it in most cases. 
Building is excellent. It's also completely pointless. There is no reason to build a base. No raids, no bad weather, no nothing. You can just occupy any building on the map to have a place for workbenches and just stack comfort items for a rest bonus. 
Finally, leveling is an ordeal. You have to unlock skills that should already be in your basic skill set, like double jump. It's also unnecessarily slow to unlock even basic skills and have any combat variety. I'll wait for some more content or change of heart I guess. Maybe I'm not ready for this game.",1707581527,1707733583,False,1,2,0.460000008344650269,0,True,False,True
1203620,156995749,76561197997164841,288,7,707,0,707,1706999349,"Bad combat can be a problem in games where the animation of each weapon type is similar or exactly the same. This can be frustrating and boring for the player as fights become predictable and don't offer much variation. When all weapons feel the same, it can feel like a monotonous experience. With bad combat, there is a likelihood that players will become less engaged and will be less likely to want to continue playing. Good combat, on the other hand, should offer a combination of varying animations and attacks, resulting in a dynamic and exciting experience.

Bad quests can be frustrating when progress is locked behind quests. This may lead players to believe that they cannot advance in the game and become more disinterested and frustrated. The quests themselves may be poorly designed or overly tedious and repetitive. This can lead to boredom and a negative experience.

Having limited character creation options in a video game can hinder engagement and immersion. While not every game needs to have extensive customization options, having very few options can create a feeling of restriction and lack of creativity. It is still in EA and I do hope they improve this in future.

Bad and repetitive dungeon design and easy mobs result in a loss of challenge and excitement. I never felt I was in a danger especially not in Shroud area, boss encounter was very easy which is a huge disappointment. Having few enemy types and having enemies that are all easy make game dull and unengaging. 

Bad loot design, where unique items can be easily found, can lead to a sense of disappointment. When unique or powerful items are too accessible, it can lead to a feeling of devaluation and decreased satisfaction when obtaining new items.

Bad UI can create a frustrating gaming experience and result in a decreased desire to play the game. Navigating through UI is so annoying, it is poorly designed and it take fun out of the game..

When it comes to crafting and building, I would say that developers did great job. The game  gives you the freedom to design your structures however you like, allowing you to create complex and creative structures or stick to the basics. The customization of bases can also be quite in depth, with various aesthetic options such as walls, roofs, and decorations that can be used to make your base your own. While crafting does not seem particularly groundbreaking or innovative, it seems to be well designed and enjoyable to use. 

It's tough to rate a game that's still in early access with the expectation that things will change later on, but I'd say that, considering this game's potential, I would give it an overall rating of 6/10, with great graphics but potential for improvements in several gameplay mechanics.",1706398383,1707731947,False,0,0,0.492813169956207275,4,True,False,True

You can see many videos online of peoples creations and its quite stunning! the game gives you ample amount of space to build your kingdom around the altar. Its cool that you can have many altars around the world too. 

Cons: No teamchat in multiplayer! :/ 

when fighting some bosses like Fell Thunderbrute and Scavenger Matron, you can easily exploit them by getting on a rooftop (or any high vantage point) and shooting at them. Most of the time they don't attack back and just stand there and let you attack them. At the very least, they could run and seek cover when they are not able to attack you. For example, the thunderbrute has no ranged attacks, so he definitely should run away. I also exploited a matron who was inside a building by throwing a bomb on the outside of it to expose her, then just shot her while on a rooftop and she just stood there staring at me. At the very least she could of thrown poison at me or ran away. 

Many issues with creatures stuck in walls or mountains or below the ground. You can hear them trying to attack you while underneath you. 

I wish if I had a food item in my blue chest, then it would let me put it in the oven or cooking pot without having to actually have the materials on me. Same with many other crafting devices. 

Inventory management is always a pain for these type of games. 

Random thoughts : it would be so cool if the animal you choose to follow you would follow you until they die if you are a beastmaster. 

When playing on a multiplayer server, it would be nice if you could make a storage crate just for yourself that no one else could take from, but they could look into it to make sure youre being honest with what contents you have. 

It would be neat to be able to inspect your friends gear instead of having to gift them it to show. 

Lets say i have already done the missions in my world, it would be cool if people joining my world had the option to do the quests that ive already done, so they can experience the story lines. 

More customization would be cool in game from characters to building designs.

I could give a pro/con reason why this game is good or bad but it doesn't really describe the problem for me. I am giving it a negative because of how it feels. You know how you start up a new survival game, you get a grasp of the basics and then you have a relatively clear plan on what to do, where to go, what the goal is, e.g. Sons of the Forest you know you are there to survive, but you are also trying to locate Victoria and her family. And the story and exploration is wrapped up really well together so each outting has a feeling of - I guess achievement and progression.

Enshrouded has the potential for this but isn't actually achieving it, and I am not sure why, you go get your companion crafters and you can expand on that, sort of, there isn't ALOT of crafting variation. Maybe the problem is because all the wells are basically the same design wise, maybe it's because the shroud doesn't actually disappear when you cleanse the area, maybe it's the lack of mob variety. I am in the desert region currently and I can count on my hands how many enemy types there are globally in the game. There is a real lack of life and ambience in the game. 

The game has this push to find a solution to the shroud without actually solving the problem, no areas are cleansed, no new un-shrouded area to utilise for building or exploring. The veil doesn't lift and new life doesn't take root. When you clear a township, there isn't any kind of prompt to rebuild it and populate it with NPC's to trade with etc, there is no feeling of changing the world, when the lore says pretty much that you are magically forged to do that exact thing. 

As for combat, and classes/abilities. Pretty mediocre, just get the water aura, the damage aura, and hug enemies butts and you win. The skill points being tied to things like shroud stalks is a hindrance especially for multiplayer, they would be better off removing the level system entirely, and going The Secret World ability pathway, where you gain exp, gain a skill point, no physical level needed. 

Needs more dungeons and dungeons need variation, needs more enemy types, needs weather, needs water in the game like literally any water. The game needs a feeling of world progression. 

Oh and last one is map UI needs some serious love, give us a checkmark system so we actually know where we have been, amongst other things.

** UPDATE: downgraded to thumbs down after realizing you hit a hard cap at 25 right when things are getting interesting making this feel more like a demo, or early alpha, and the primary reasoning is that no where int he description does it state this hard cap, instead the marketing leads you to believe you're getting a full experience  **

Taking into account the hard cap which made me stop playing, the exploration in this game is amazing, as you walk around so many things catch your attention and beckon you to explore, and when you do you are rewarded. In addition, it also has an overall goal for you to focus on that you can tackle as you wish. 

All of the elements of the game seem to be focused and enabling your exploration. The building, crafting, survival elements are well done and don't distract you from going where you want to go. 

Overall, even in early access this game feels fun to play and is pretty close to feature complete but the decision by the developer to artificially cap progression at such a low level is questionable and might lead to buyers remorse.

Dodging, oh wait, I lost more stamina. I run away to regain stamina and look, I hit 100 yards and still no stamina to fight. The stamina regeneration is so slow. Not even worth fighting.  Weapon and tool durability loss is horrible. Having to repair items so often is just lame.

Weapons and armor are just the same up to level 10 and fighting things that are level 15 to get to quests with a low level weapon. Grinding materials for upgrades is so tedious. The world is decent to explore, but constantly running into hill sides/cliffs is just annoying. Climbing system would be great in this game or more grapple points.

This is a very pretty, yet insanely shallow and un-survival'ish survival game that mostly features a chore list of quests to go get a thing for an NPC at your base so you can craft the next thing. Which wouldn't be terrible, save for the fact that every quest is just as deep as most Hogwart's POIs - literally an open air POI with some mobs and a chest - that you blast through in a matter of moments only to move on to the next thing. The mob AI is astoundingly stupid, and I'm just frankly lacking any feeling of having to really prep myself for excursions or be careful with supplies (a-la ""survival""). But, it's pretty and the combat does get surprisingly deep for what it is, once you'e developed some skills. The base building system, however, is top notch. Objects seamlessly merge together at the edges and create nice, smooth contours. You can also use the deform tools to ""etch"" away bits from objects you place in order to do some pretty cool things. It's got a massive map too, so there's that. Potential, I'd say, but I doubt the devs would fundamentally overhaul all of the quest POIs to make them more engaging and challenging vs. just noodling around the edges with new skills and items.

I think people forget that reviews are personal opinions and not facts. People that speak in absolutes are Sith and they have no place here.

To me:

This game is very good, nay, great. 

I try to give unbiased opinions as the only two games I openly am not fond of are guitar hero and games where they release a new one each year, but add nothing to the game except updating the game cover. *coughs* I am looking at you Madden.

I usually don't give reviews of game, but there has to be some voices of reason to combat ignorant reviews on here. Nitpicking games is what makes the gaming community so weak. And this game is not worthy of that negativity.

So, I will give a quick and honest opinion of my run down of it. When I started playing it the say it came out I didn't have any issues playing it and connecting with my friends as I did with Palworld and others we had played this year. When you only have a few free nights to play with your friends this is everything. I created a world, set the password and we were off. 

There was nice feeling of this game right from the start. The world is beautiful and responsive. It made my friends and I feel like we were trying to survive in this world that Keen Games created. There is nothing better to my friends and I than the bond that is formed when playing a survival game together, especially one that makes you feel like you are trying to thrive in the world. 

The combat isn't that different from other games. The parry and dodge system a lot of players are getting used to is smooth in this as it is in any other game. 

The control smoothness of using a keyboard or a controller is so noticeable that even my wife said ""damn this game is smootttttttttth"". And if a novice like her notices it must mean its good. And it is good. You can pit it against other games and the sensitivity, motion, avatar responsiveness is one of the best I have ever played. To deny it, would make your ignorance and bias show. Good job, Keen Games. 

The destructible world is great. Stuck? Break whats around you or toss some grenades at it and blow it away. It creates a nonlinear feel to the game that puts it above others of the same genre. 

There is not a lot of videos and cut scenes. I am here to play games, not watch them. I fully support games moving to this. Paying actors and such to make a movie isn't why I play games, I play them as an escape into new worlds and to have fun. And this game is fun, especially with friends.

There is something for everyone. You can be a magic user, healer, two-hander, sword and shield, or an archer. Yes, it can be a pain to get arrows, but that is the cost of being a beast that doesn't rely on locking on fighting. I played all the main variations and I have to say they all were quite fun. My wife even commented she felt more like a Harry Potter wizards with the wands and staves in this game than in Hogwarts Legacy. But then she switched to a tanking character to be a beast and satisfy her blood lust. Like I said, something for everyone. 

Some folks have said the story isn't great, and how nonlinear it is. For people that still have imaginations and love being dropped into new worlds to explore of their own freewill and do quests as they find them, this is for you.

Inventory - no weight system? The best decision really. I play with a bunch of loot goblins and they love it. 

Food - eating as a power up and not as a necessity? amazing.

Building - the way that you build the materials and then go into build mode and have the option of locking grid vs not...AMAZING. People like me who love building can create some beautiful homes for their teams that guess what...HELP THEIR TEAM. Building a comforted home that rises in levels and upgrading your home to get bigger to increase the comfort so as to buff your teammates? Hell yeah. They knew what they were doing when they made this game. 

That is the best part about what Keen Games has created. They did a great fan service game of smooth and logical game play that was fun. There was a lot less of ""why would they do this?"" from my friend group and more ""That is so smart and nifty.

It is not particularly long, and the bad guys need fleshed out but what early access game doesn't have that. Heck one Sea of Thieves came out there were skeletons and players and people were happy. In this there are regulars, elites, bosses, and beasts. More than enough different things to fight. But the battles are good and no way are any more similar than anything else out there. 

The initial map is large, but huge but large enough to make a variety of bases and fight in different locations and biomes. 

If you are on the edge try it, it's not as unreasonably prices as most games that are out there with more potential to come.

I could go on, but hopefully this is long enough to peak your interest. Just remember to form your own opinions of a game or you might miss out on a great one.

You need to redo your questing system completely so everyone can experience everything the game has to offer otherwise it will end up a mediocre and forgettable title.

I seldom write reviews but Enshrouded has compelled me to put my thoughts down. Is the game good? Yes and No. 

Gameplay is fun and the sense of exploration is fantastic. It has a great foundation to be something special BUT it has some fundamental design issues. 

1) Leveling is very poorly done. I progressed through 40ish or so hours with the exact same weapons. A million common drops or even worse Legendary drops with worse stats than an early Epic really takes you out of grinding. 

2) Enemy variety is lacking. You will encounter 5 or 6 enemy types the entire game. Every area begins to feel the same because you are constantly facing the same enemy types. 

3) Enemy Scaling is garbage. Killing a Level 1 enemy vs killing a Level 30 drops the same exact loot. Why would I farm a higher tier zone? Only point of higher tier zones is for materials tied only to these areas. It is not face stronger enemies with better drops.

4) Building types are pointless. Over the course of your play through you will pick up better build block types. Some even with the Epic tag. The problem with this, there is literally no point in using them. They do not give a comfort bonus for higher tier/nicer build blocks. There is also zero point is having more than 1 base. Place a main base, then only put alters and a work bench to repair weapons/tools if needed while farming. Another problem with bases, they're never attacked. This really draws away from the point of building bigger or more secure. You could live out of a 1x2 with a big court foundation square for your minions the entire game. 

5) Quests are mehhhh, not terrible but not wonderful either. It's basically 3 quest types. Fetch, Kill/Boss Fights, & Area clears. Quests types could really use some variety. 

All in all, I enjoyed my early access time with Enshrouded but I don't think I'll be back for a while. It will need a lot of updates and design changes for me to attempt another play through. My recommendation, give it a solid 2 years in the oven to mature.

Edit: Clarification is obviously needed why I'm down voting aka Not Recommending. The comments have clearly leaned into three areas (Time spent, Value, and You liked it?!?!). 

1) ""You put 70 hours and down vote, clown"" 
2) ""70 hours is a lot of value for an EA title""
3) ""You said gameplay is fun & it has an excellent foundation""

Let me be clear. I enjoyed Enshrouded, but each passing day, that spark dimmed. I want to elaborate why I've set my review to Not Recommended. 

Day 1, ""WOW this map is huge and look at all these icons!"" As time passed, hmmm ok, it's a repeat of the same things to do over and over. Fighting the same enemies, just to receive the same mediocre loot. 

Next high to low moment, building my base. ""Ok, the building controls are solid and work well. ""Damn there are a million build types"", ""Wait, I can't just upgrade the material type? I have to remove and add, why???"" ""Nothing attacks, whats the point in spending time doing all of this?"" At the end I realized that building for the screenshot is nice and all, but having a built in game mechanic, the comfort bonus that does not interface with building qualities that unlock along your journey is very lackluster. One, because building & harvesting resources is a time requirement w/ no payback and two, there is no threat to make you engage w/ protecting your investment. 

Again, same thing with leveling. At the start it's flowing and unlocking all these new crafting recipes, but yet again the flaws start to show. Why am I going to these higher tier zones, getting weapons & armor that is higher quality but worse stats. Then you start seeing weapons and armor on repeat, ohhh ok so the loot table isn't large enough yet. This is one area that could make the game immediately jump up in quality. It needs to feel exciting grinding for better gear. 

I say all this to come to my final point. Yes, I put 70 hours on a $30 game. Does that qualify as good cost to time value, absolutely. I've also reiterated the foundation of the game is fantastic and has the potential to be the best action RPG/survival game that's come out in the last few years. I think most of these flaws will be addressed as they move through Early Access, which come to my final key point. If I had to do it again, I'd wait until these things are addressed.

I enjoyed Valheim and this is a step up in most aspects imo with quests and better building but with the same finicky placement at times. 

You can keybind every key unlike Palworld. I use arrows for movement, the NumPad for skills and jump, RCtrl, RShift, Del, Inset, PageUp and PageDown and can keybind them all. Only thing is that the looting keys are not in settings so you can't keybind them from what I've seen which is F for loot all and Space bar for loot single item.

It also has 5 crafter NPC's you can place anywhere on your land. It has a very similar progression system to Valheim which feels satisfying. Crafted gear, more times than not, is better than gear you find. Only gripe with crafting is that you can find most of the non-gear stuff you can craft as you explore so a lot of it never has to actually be crafted by you and so feels like empty blueprints or a wasted effort.

 The combat is a step up from Valheims' imo and even has a skill tree with classes. It is very basic at this point in time but it is at least something and it is a good start though needs work for sure. Some of the skills in the skill tree allow you a chance to shoot multiple arrows or summon a skull head that fires at enemies or a double jump or a jump slam attack, etc. so you can do more than just button mash but just barely more.

 Graphics are a cross between Valheim and New World. Not as good as New World but not as stylized as Valheim. But be warned, there is so much fog/mist/shroud in the game that you need a decent rig right now with, I think, 6gb VRAM. I've read that the Devs said they could play the game with ""most"" 4gb VRAM GPU's but never told us how so I'd wait for an update if you are not able to run it at this point in time.

 I've enjoyed this game so much I'm about to start a new world and play a Ranger, first character was melee, and take my time and explore and see if I missed somethings. If interested I'd say buy it, try it out and if you don't like it within 2 hours return it. You'll be able to tell if the fog/mist/shroud can be handled by your game also within that time frame.",1707053224,1707699453,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is trying to use a great deal of mechanics that we all kinda like from other games and the devs seem to want to get feedback from the community about what might make the game better/enjoyable while fitting into their design. I will still suggest it if you enjoy Valheim or other similar survival builder games because you can get a lot out of it already.

That being said I have some gripes about the game that I think they need to work on. I put in around 140 hours as of writing this, did almost everything in the early access. I like the game, but wanting it to be great means it needs to work on some core game play mechanics.

---The most important issues needing to be worked on would be movement and world interaction. The grappling hook and glider can add to the game but how they are currently implemented they quickly become an annoyance when moving around the map. The grappling hook is bound to the same button as interacting with the rest of the world so you accidentally grab onto the few random placed attachment points when you really don't want to and because of the glider interactions you either end up bonking your head then slamming into the ground or you open your glider and end up somewhere random away from where you were. The double jump feature doesn't work properly most of the time, more so when the glider button is the same as the jump so you activate the glider when you are trying to double jump more often than you double jump. The movement also is halting when you are trying to move around and fight, you get locked up when changing weapons, trying to block attacks, healing, managing your food, etc. If you try to do something while holding the forward button (or accidentally hit a menu button) you get locked in place requiring you to release the direction button and push it again, this might seem like a minor thing but that confusing second in game with enemies coming at you or projectiles means you die stuck in place or are unable to attempt to move into the correct direction to put up your shield. The target lock system only makes this worse. There is sneak in the game, you need to crouch to use it, but unlike almost all other games pushing the ""run"" button doesn't end crouch so if enemies get close while you are trying to sneak you can't get out of it quickly and run away from them, another situation of getting stuck for a split second that can get you killed.
-Aiming/auto aim needs fixed, you should automatically aim at the closest thing trying to kill you not some random thing in the background.
-Hitboxes need adjusted. Some are far too big, some are too small, some are activatable even when you aren't looking at them (grappling points).
-Interacting with things is too delayed. This also can get you killed if you accidentally ""loot"" something while in combat.
-It would be great having more NPCs to save and use in your base, but it would also be nice if they actually did something such as some of the farming or resource gathering. 
-Having a settlement system for the NPCs would be really nice, yes you can build you own base, but being able to clear out a town for the NPCs would be even better for the immersion of the game world. You could do the design and building because everything is broken, but they have a community for you to make along the way. Maybe even using that as stepping points to the upgrades in the game as each area has different resources to gather and use so each settlement has those resources.
-A few more fast travel points would be nice. You can make alters (more as you progress), but it might be better to just be able to use the alters already around instead and have the ones you use for your base, this would give you more reason to explore to find the alters so you have fast travel points in more places.
-There are issues with the map. The zoom need to be expanded to the whole map, and they need to fix the hitboxes of the icons/point so they don't stop you from interacting with the map.
-Some pickier aspects deal with building such as it being stuck on a 90* rotation for the placement of buildings. You can make some interesting bases with just that, but you could make a lot more (in a building survival game) with more freedom of rotation. They already do this with some of the decorations/workstations, so the system to do so with the buildings should also be there. There are building pieces that aren't labeled (doors specifically) so you don't know until you waste the materials on them that they aren't the same size as the rest of the even number based building, those need to be better labeled in the crafting menu, and that leads into the issue with much of the building pieces just being far too material costly. Sure the weapons/armor (that are almost worthless when you are exploring and finding far better) should be expensive, but to encourage base building creativity things like windows/doors/etc. should be cheaper to make so you can do more with them and experiment without spending hours gathering materials, hours waiting for them to process, then realizing you don't like them after starting to use them for your base. They somewhat have levels of building depending on your progress in the game, but many of the decorations don't actually match at all for those materials in that current level, currently Iron and Sandstone are the last ""level"" of materials but the iron decorations don't match the sandstone blocks, by that I mean the color pallets don't match (and the iron doors are some of the ones that are odd size instead of even throwing off the dimensions of your base). Having a Minecraft style crouch building so you don't fall off things would be amazing though I don't think that one will ever show up, also would be nice because of the issues with the glider mentioned before as you fall off then have to use the glider if you don't want to die hitting the ground and end up a long way off from what you were doing also likely accidentally deleting something random as the button to close the glider is the same as removing blocks and you can have both out at the same time, the glider doesn't close out the building function.
-There are more but you get the point I think for now.

Honestly you can already see some decent suggestion on the suggestion forum that was setup and the devs are actively monitoring it, as long as you ignore the nonsense cosmetic outfit requests, seriously if you want to play Barbie dress-up go do that with real clothes, video games don't have to do that and you are kinda insulting the devs/artists who are making the game wanting them to put clothing for you to change the look of your character with no actual effect on the game play.

Its still ""early access"", you can't even access to the whole map yet, so I hope the devs take some of the suggestions along with more polish on the game they are wanting to do already, as I said at the start the game has a lot of potential it just needs some QOL, some fixes in the systems already there, and more content in general for the finished game.",1707699159,1707699159,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I can't help not compare it very closely as the love child between those two games. It's still early and no idea how this will shake out, although they took the best of most of Valheim and made it better. Heck, the graphics alone are a great improvement.

It's pretty easy to figure out what's going on and I've only found myself googling around out of curiosity more than necessity, compared to some games where you need to have majored in some degree to understand what the devs were intending. 

Building is a little rough around the edges, although tolerable. I like the micro fiddling you can do after you put a full piece up and can remove little parts of it (or the reverse). Not a horrible selection of building pieces at the moment and fairly easy to make something look nice.

I like the take on the rescues and utilizing them to advance. It makes your home feel just a tad more alive. Adventuring is a bit rough due to limited space. At least you can most always teleport and your inventory isn't limited by weight (what a drag in most games).

Leveling curve seems a bit off and I think right now the cap is 25. Considering the tree, that's not a lot and it's a long grind to get meaningful levels. Thankfully some of the early ones make some differences. 

Questing is a bit of a toss up. Considering it's meant to be a coop game and quests are currently server-wide instead of per player, it looks like if you aren't all together in MP, not everyone gets the XP. So those out completing the quests and looting get far ahead of the ones taking care of the kids at home. The whole respawn, reboot to respawn thing seems off a bit as well. Only one person can get loot from a chest, so anyone that runs out exploring ahead of others takes it all (not that they can't share) and everyone else has to wait for a reboot to repopulate the chests.

Overall, I'm really happy with the game. Setting up a dedicated server took all of 5m. Currently no options to do much customization with the server, although it ran rock solid and no crashes. That alone is much better than most all the other sandbox games when they hit EA.

Anxious to see where this goes. Only real downer for me was that, like Conan, its a fixed world (ala Conan), so replay isn't as exciting as it could be.",1707697669,1707697669,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

i just finished rebuilding a half destroyed town up north, with a friend - we stumbled upon it during a quest and fell in love with the layout of the town and buildings .. now we're spending our time fixing walls, bridges, roofs, decorating rooms instead of being out there beating up baddies XD
I never played a game where the player could change already existing buildings to that extent, that's a first for me !
Having the 5 NPCs like the blacksmith, hunter, farmer etc live on your base is also a nice touch, makes it feel even more like a home :) 

The wide variety of weapons, armor, spells & potions and impressive skill trees also allows for a plethora of different builds !
Of course, the game is still in early access, the world is not infinite but also absolutely not small and filled with quests, secrets and treasure \o/ there's a lot to explore already, a good variety of different biomes, animals, enemies, plants, ores etc. .. the shroud itself is also a very refreshing concept .. the thrill of entering a foggy, hostile, nightmarish home to strong enemies that could easily end you or to get the life sucked out of you by the shroud itself if you don't get out in time !

Overall, I have a positive impression of the game, enjoyed my time solo, and am looking forward to more in the future.

PROS:
Generally speaking, the games controls are great and it plays very nicely, the graphics and world design are beautiful and interesting. The skill tree is decent and feels varied enough. The scale of the world feels big but not empty. Solo play feels exciting and balanced, despite being a bit too easy due to enemy AI. I like games that are heavily exploitable as it leads to creative/memorable game play scenarios and enshrouded is very exploitable in its current state.

CONS:
Building is not important in enshrouded despite the amount of work the devs put into the system and options. It is similar to Minecraft where there is no stability and you generally don't have to think about anything other than what might look cool when building. No stability/raids = no urgency, no strategy, no sense of preparation or planning. The map needs to show all POIs that have been completed, not only shroud roots. This is very very annoying. The constant linear fetch quest nature from base to POIs feels very tedious and reduces the sense of adventure to completing a grocery list for npcs. Group play feels bad. The quests are too linear, bosses/encounters too easy, map for groups too confusing, quest progress for groups too confusing, it is just not a good multiplayer experience. In games like Valheim, Rust, and Minecraft, the experience is greatly improved playing co-op or multiplayer. In Enshrouded, the experience is only diminished.  I don't know how they pulled that off, but it feels bad. Item durability loss is absurdly over-tuned and becomes a constant annoyance, even with lvl 25 legendary items. Traveling in the game feels bad until late game where it feels great. Especially as they increase the size of the map, the base stamina, glider range, etc should be buffed. Due to the fetch quest nature of the gameplay loop, replay ability is likely on the low end and enshrouded feels like a one and done adventure game, not an open survival game you'd play for hundreds or thousands of hours.

I especially love Enshrouded voxel engine (yeah, they made their own engine, rare case today) that makes building smooth and final buildings look like actual buildings and not some blocky mess. Or when you blow up some house with enemies inside and how the building looks after that, with parts of wall missing, splints sticking out from broken parts, and so on. 
Combat is pretty fun and rewarding. You can be mage, you can be tank, you can be the swordsman, archer, or even stealthy assassin (although that seems to be pretty pointless in this game).
Exploration aspect is phenomenal, there is _lots_ of POIs, with loot, cave systems, enemy camps, etc etc etc. I really enjoyed just walking around and discovering new things.
They also implemented bunch of quality of life changes from the start - one of the best, for example, is ability to craft from storage boxes. This one tiny change improves gameplay by a ton, saving you alot of time.
Oh, and server can be self-hosted. This is nice addition for coop players who don't want to pay companies like gportal for semi-working, unstable setup.

There is bad parts too: 
1) Same enemies can be level 1, level 15 and level 25 (and probably higher) and they all drop same loot. So why bother with farming high-level enemies if you can just oneshot bunch of lvls 1 for same amount and type of materials? 
2) Weapon variety can be better too, i used same stuff for 25 hours, except only level changed. Bonuses are same, design is same, only real change is damage #

But i guess we can write that off since it's early access game.

I'll keep my eye on that game, and i really hope they will do better than valheim. At least comparing both at start (and i feel like enshouded was partially inspired by valheim) enshrouded is vastly better.",1707691212,1707691212,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- This is the closest thing you'll find to a Zelda game on PC
- There's a huge world to explore
- The game already feels quite polished (except for performance) for an early access game
- The game encourages you to explore just the right way with not too much hand holding
- Beautiful graphics & great atmosphere
- The Shroud is a good gameplay element that feels original & fresh
- The game is a lot of fun solo as well
- Combat is frantic & engaging with a mix of melee & ranged combat
- There's quite some books & scrolls to read to build up the back story which is quite interesting
- Building is actually not that great a grind compared to games such as Valheim which require a LOT more gathering to build a sizeable base

==== THE BAD (mediocre) ====
- The world does feel a bit dead - while this IS a dead world, some surviving traders would have been great
- The level of monsters artificially limit how far you can explore at a time which limits the actual freedom & forces you to do the quests in a rather linear fashion.
- I'm not fond of the way magic works - it's a bit of a hassle to be honest
- Towns are kind of ... empty & soulless with not enough interesting stuff to find or loot. I hope they will receive more work
- While the game is not that hard, it can be rather unforgiving at moments with instant deaths being quite possible catching you off-guard
- The shroud, while a great mechanic, can not be removed. There's a mechanic to remove some of it temporarily but I wish you could remove the individual shrouds by killing all the monsters & fungi. However you can't because ... (see ""the ugly"")

==== THE UGLY ====
- The game resets EVERYTHING each time you log in except for your base. Every chest you looted, every monster you killed, every mine you mined, it all gets reset and to me this is by far the worst negative because it makes you feel as if you're not having a real impact on the world. The only real progress is your base, your character & your map. The problem is that the mechanics rely on respawning of things which is a shame. Being able to ""heal"" the world & kill the monsters (with some respawning at random to keep things fresh) would have made the game a LOT better. Instead it feels like an MMO where nothing you do really affects the world.
- Some really poor performance even on high end hardware. I got killed more than once because the game would start to stutter at the worst moments

This is a game with many hours of fun to be had and so far it doesn't feel tired at all, with new stuff continuously keeping things fresh. I hope the devs do not mess with the formula too much - too many of these early access games start out great and then get bogged down with needless features that water down the pure core of the game.

Difficulty tends toward being too easy even when solo. The death penalty is fairly light as the backpack inventory is dropped but not everything and nothing on your hotbars will drop. You then respawn at the last checkpoint, of which there are often some close by if you're anywhere dangerous. With as low of consequences for death as that is, I'd like to see server settings to increase difficulty substantially. 

The building system is the best I've encountered, although without that much reason to build an extensive house/base beyond the will to do so. 

The Enshrouded mechanic of putting the player on a timer when in the mist is better than I anticipated. There are a lot of ways to lengthen the timer with perks, potions, and awareness of the environment. It is much more freeform than I initially thought it would be. Making a decision to press on without knowing if I would find a way out provided some decent tension.

For now, the progression is from two forest biomes to a highlands and then to a desert. There is a noticeable dropoff in quality after the two forest areas. Space between notable points starts to increase, lots of 'dead' area within shroud environments, unfinished areas with floating structures aren't uncommon. But the first two forest areas are very well done and dense with things to discover.

Weapons should ideally have much more varied movesets. There should be more weapon types as well. Switching weapons is quite easy though. I was constantly switching between a sword, two-handed hammer, and a bow. 

There is a night/day system that is excellent. Traversing at night is much more dangerous, as it should be. The torch becomes invaluable and can be either put away with ease or thrown on the ground to engage in combat. There is a stealth system but it isn't fleshed out enough yet as enemy movement is often too erratic for the slow pace of movement even with a perk that speeds it up.

The perk system is nice but needs heavy balancing. Double Jump is too easy to get and by far the best perk. Everyone will want it so I would either make it baseline and balance around it or move it far down into the stamina part of the tree. As it is, you will often need to take some odd or inconsequential perks to get the ones you want. There are some perks that are just busted. One causes the enemy to be stunned when hit with an explosive arrow, but this includes a rather easy to craft Shroud Arrow. I could stun bosses and tough enemies all day long if I wanted to.

Enemy AI needs some way to more properly deal with players that jump up to a higher standing. As it is, the most aggressive enemies and many bosses can be quite easily dealt with by just climbing higher and ranging them to death. 

My most wanted 'extra' feature is definitely weather. There is no rain or storms to arrive. No high winds that suddenly make the trees dance and come alive. The game could really use something like this for immersion. 

Beyond that, I'd like to see more special and random enemies. Enemies that have special random properties to make battle less predictable. Many of the same enemies at the start are still the mainstay of enemies at the end, just higher level. While I did enjoy the combat, the game needs some random elements to break up the mundane elements. 

Still, this is one of the most promising games I've played in a long time and I will definitely be playing it a while longer and then revisiting it down the line.",1707684001,1707684121,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I have explored almost all of whats available of the map and have hit the current level cap (only about 1/3 is released, but it's quite large), games fun. If you enjoyed Valheim, you should like this more. 
The building might not have physics like Valheim but it makes building easier, it is a fantasy game. And they aren't short on choices either. Lots and lots of options on building materials, actually quite surprised with how many choices already in the game. You can be quite creative when it comes to building as you can individually place single blocks down to shape it however you want, unfortunately there is no round or curved building mats yet in the current game.   
There's questing to do and dungeons to conquer with bosses to fight.
The game starts off slow, and you will probably die a lot in combat but carry on, it really hit's it stride when you hit level 10. I suggest getting the double jump perk asap, makes traversing and fighting a lot easier. Also try out the blink perk, replaces the normal dodge with an instant teleport, great skill to have if you want to play a range character. My build is a mix of warrior and battle mage with some skills in the other trees.
For me personally i have not had any performance issues or game crashes, and I look forward to what they add.

**Original Review**
This is what Valheim tried to be, great game so far, the game world looks incredible, the combat is well done for this type of game, its not clunky like valheim is. Multiple ways to build your character, lots of different classes to spec into. If you're a fan of survival and fantasy rpg games, then this games for you. Also there is a lot of crafting options in this game, you just have to learn the blueprints, building takes a bit to get use to but i find it way better then lets say, valheim.

This game does a lot of things right but still lacks some balance. I often (very often) have the problem of delays. You carry out an action, the avatar stands still and does nothing at first, only when you press a button again, even if it is the same, does a new action start, which gives me a bit of the old arcade slot machine feeling. (Hang on the button so that Mario actually jumps over the barrel).

The beginner zone is really well developed, a lot of it is in detail and you have to look for a lot of it first and it's best to hit everything and collect it if you can. Can unlock something you need.

The AI are partly good and partly as logical as the stones in the game. If you find the right place, every opponent can be defeated quickly. The right setting of skills is also important here

I find it strange that I can almost still run around and fight with the beginner weapon in additional zones where opponents become stronger. This needs to be improved.

For Early Access, the game is already very advanced and you can play, explore and build a lot.

Manufacturing was divided into many different tables and places. And some of them can only be unlocked with masters that you have to search for and “free” in the process.

For lovers of building, designing, decorating, remodelling and rebuilding, a lot has been done here, I'm already looking forward to seeing houses, castles and palaces in all kinds of creations and beauties from the creative people in this genre.

Unlike some others, I find the fact that the “home” zone is free to be very relaxing here. With Valheim, for example, it was sometimes annoying until the patch.

However, always keep in mind that you are playing an Early Access and errors will always appear, which can also be amusing.",1707679092,1707679385,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- Some items in the world are floating a bit off the ground. Isn't game breaking, just quite funny to look it.

- THE GOD DAMN AUDIO BUG IS SO ANNOYING. Sometimes music/enemy SFX will just ear rape you. It sounds like some deep fried nuke in your ears and there is no telling when it might happen. Certain boss/miniboss themes will always start with a static-like noise.

The game looks really pretty with the shadow and lighting effects carrying a lot of the ambience. Floral density is nice. The music and sound effects are great. This game has by far the most fleshed out and intuitive voxel base building mechanics. Traversal with chain hook and glider makes exploration more fun.
The idea of finding NPCs and summoning them in your base reminds me of Terrariia in a good way.

I like how the game approaches food a lot. Instead of smacking you the dreaded hunger and thirst bar, foods and drinks offer sustainably powerful and incredible buffs. What I dislike is that cooking takes forever. Why are there stations where I can put ingredients in and let them procure a product on their own but for my cooking stove I have to manually grill my steaks or berries one at a time? No thank you.

However all of this is overshadowed with huge letdowns and unsatisfying lacklusters. Of course this is an early access and I hope the game is fleshed out a ton more but not even for 30 bucks can I recommend this game in its current state.

The fact that I can only use my grapling hook at certain predestined spots is ultra bad. It goes completely against the idea of absolute freedom in sandbox survival games. If even Palword can get a grapling gun to work with every terrain, I would've expected the same here. Especially when the terrain looks like a post nuclear bombardmenet field. The verticality is way too crass and there is no intuition as to how points of interest are otherwise reachable. I found myself running in circles a lot without checking the map constantly, because the world feels like isolated islands in a sea of deadly shroud, making the world feel very disconnected. Which brings me to the next point: Why is there no mini map in any corner? Why does my exploration need to be halted constantly by checking the big map? That is bad game design.

What makes this worse is that this big world is populated by only 3 types of animals (I have not explored the entire map yet, but I've covered a lot of the central and rightmost parts of the map).

These being wolves, bunnies and goats. Thats it. Oh yes, occasionally you can fight bee swarms with your sword, lol. And the only 2 types of enemies I've seen are copypaste bandits and undeads in the shroud. All of this together skyrockets the fatigue, especially when exploring is unrewarding entirely. There was not a single time where I was excited to find a new point of interest and delve further into it, as a fact there are no such points of interest that take you for a longer ride with nice rewards. 

That leaves the towers where the NPCs are. These are some sort of jump'n'run and puzzle solving areas. Incredibly boring, simple and short. 

The best item I've gotten from a chest so far is a legendary bow that has the exact same stats as an uncommon bow I was already using... what?

I've seen 2 ""bosses"" so far and I have to say, yea the game tries to imitate souls-like fights but with only 1 - 2 moves per enemy and weapon on your part that also turns into a repetitve bore fest. The enemies are too static in their moveset, there is no feeling of dynamic battle at all, you can cheese everything with jump slam. It is not engaging, there are not stakes and the loot is so bare bone and broing that I repeatedly found myself asking myself why I'm doing this at all.

Ah yes there is a third type of enemy I have encountered. A wombat, checwbacca kind of hybrid animal-humans with shamans, but as I said earlier, none of these enemies look unique or introduce a mechanic or a thing of surprise that makes the encounters engaging at all.

I've also tried digging into cave systems, as this is voxel based, I had hopes to find huge cave systems or dungeons like in minecraft, but alas there is nothing. Literally nothing. You can pickaxe yourself to death into a hole and nothing will come from it, regardless of what direction you dig. Sad.

Also sad that there are indestructible buildings. Imo the game lacks a good physics engine. 

Lastly, I have a personal problem with the player character model. It looks very uncanny and reminds me of dwarves, rather than humans. If that is what they are, okay, but in no world are legs the same length as arms. Legs should be a bit longer than the arms always. As it is the player character model looks very comical.

This is an early access alright. But comparing it to other similar early access games leaves me sour. There is a lot of potential here but comparing this to Palworld, a game created by a bunch of dudes that knew nothing of game development or coding at all, I can't help but remain disappointed by the lack of content and lost opportunities.

For example, why are there no roaming NPCs? Whom give you quests or trade with you, why are there no random encounters that make the world more lively. Heck, there are so many references as to how to make a game like this right, that I find it hard to believe why they've missed out on all that.

I can only hope that they will adress these issues in time and breathe life into this game. But as for now I'd recommend staying away.

My comments are going to assume you've read about the core features of the game: Voxel world, really versatile building, RPG like elements with skill tree and loot hunting, etc. If you haven't played and aren't familiar with the core systems and loop this review may not be very valuable to you.

Progression feels really solid from levels 1-25. Gear upgrades and trying out different skill tree builds follow a nice curve, which I would hope can continue as the game expands to higher levels, with a mix of direct upgrades and lateral choices. The depth of gear choices will ideally drill down over time so that two characters who both choose a Ranger tree build, for example, can still feel different from each other based on gear-based enhancements and supporting skill choices.

Enemies need a little beefing up. Enemy archers tend to fire too slowly, and it's too easy to out-range any mob that doesn't the ability to fight back from a distance. Increasing enemy health and damage is not going to be enough to make it feel properly challenging. Enemies are going to have to receive some behavior tweaks to make combat more dynamic, less boring.

My absolutely biggest concern is the Early Access version of fast travel. It is far too easy an convenient. Being able to teleport from any location not covered in Shroud trivializes the need for building forward operating bases. Everyone making comparisons to Valheim here have a critically important point: Needing to build bases at the other end of portals, not being able to take portals with certain key materials... they force players to take advantage of the building system, which is really enjoyable. Enshrouded's building system is amazing, and progression through the worlds should absolutely force you to take advantage of all 8 of your max build slots.

There are many different ways this can be done. Valheim uses things like certain crops only growing in certain biomes, but mostly the restriction of key crafting materials not being transportable via fast travel means you have to rebuild your means of production closer to the source.

A second aspect to this is threats to your base builds. Currently bases are under no threats, ever. Why dig a moat or build a defensive wall? There's no reason beyond aesthetics at the moment, and this could be developed to make building a true part of the end game. I can see this being challenging due to how freely players can build into the sky and into the ground, but one suggestion is to make players want to defend their bases for rewards. Maybe key bosses who have unique loot drops only come from base attack events. If you build in the sky or deep underground, those events don't spawn for you. Alternatively, the Flame Altar building area can be restricted on the Z axis along with the X and Y.

Anything else I might say would be getting really nitpicky. Keen Games have something really special here and will need to balance listening to player feedback and making changes that are good for the long term health of the game. I would absolutely pay again for the full release if it came with another bunch of levels to grind through, more map to explore, more bosses and dungeons in those new areas, and refined gear, combat, and building progression systems.

Thank you for the fun!",1707672880,1707672880,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's a lot of fun to be had, with surprisingly abundant content and a vast map to explore. The graphics are pleasing, although they could benefit from further optimization. When discussing this game, I often find myself saying things like ""I wish there was this"" or ""I wish there was that,"" indicating that the game could greatly benefit from quality of life improvements and mod support.

The base game is impressive, but it has the potential to become so much more. The development team has done an incredible job, but there's room for expansion. Implementing mod support would open the door for thousands of players to contribute their own features, making the gameplay more customizable to individual preferences.

Overall, it's a pleasant experience, but the world can feel somewhat empty and repetitive. Monster density is low, and the same monsters are reused from early levels to the end, including the bosses.

It's definitely early access. At the time of this writing there's a really bad memory leakage issue late game that can be troublesome unless you are mindful of how many things you're planting / storing at your camp but overall the experience is solid.

The Good:
[list]
[*] The quest / journal system is well thought out and helps guide you to the right places for your level but lets you go off course into some tough areas early on if that's your thing
[*] The ambiance of the abandoned settlements, crypts, and ancient towers is spot on. This is a really beautiful world.
[*] Most combat styles are intuitive.
[*] The building and planting system make dealing with grass and leveling ground easy. Snapping and rotating while building is smooth and easy. Whoever coded this is my new best friend.
[*] Multiplayer seems well balanced and fun with friends
[/list]
The Bad:
[list]
[*] There are moments in combat where you'll die while waiting for an animation to finish playing
[*] The world is remarkably empty. It's early access. I'm sure there's more to come, but there are vast stretches of nothingness and some abandoned POIs with literally no enemies in them at all
[*] Farming is part frustrating (planting... give me the ability to snap here please) and part obscenely broken (yield). For most of the crops in the game, turning 10 into seeds and then planting them will yield more stock than you'll ever need (depending on your class) while others (like flax) you'll need to plant hundreds at a time to get top tier armor crafted which strains the game engine. Seed and crop yields and crafting recipes need some balancing.
[*] At the moment there is no easy way of cleaning up derelict POIs to make them into your base. It can be done, it just isn't easy.
[*] Cooking feels mostly pointless. You get good enough buffs from gear most of the time that a drink of water and some roasted meat is all you really need outside of times when you're going in for a Well or boss battle.
[/list]
The Ugly:
[list]
[*] The game suffers from Skyrim Syndrome. Wandering into a POI you will either see bandits, fell, or green skeletons plus blue bugs. Later on, red bugs get added in occasionally for flavor. There are of course slight variations here, and this blanket statement ignores the neat wildlife on the world map, but I hope they find a way to add more variety to dungeons to make them feel more unique.
[*] The world is not persistent. This helps you with infinite resources to mine but results in shroud roots respawning, leaving you with the feeling that nothing you've done matters.
[*] There's a hard level cap after which you don't get any XP anymore and that isn't explained anywhere in the game. You do get extra skill points the first time you chop any of the shroud roots, but if you were waiting for those extra points to get that last skill you were looking for, tough noogies.
[*] There are green acid guys who run at incredibly fast speed and hit like a truck. The game does nothing to prepare you for them and they at times are harder than some of the bosses, especially when coming at you in multiples. They're endemic of some of the rough edges on this game. There's a lot of tutorial content in the game for simple things, but some of the harder game elements you just kinda stumble on and learn the hard way. If there was any lore on these guys, I haven't seen it yet. It would have been nice to have lore leading up to the minibosses, leading up to harder enemies, to at least give attentive players a clue that some things are going to be severe ramps in difficulty.
[*] The AI doesn't always know how to handle height differences. They can't climb so if they can't run to you they sometimes just stand there frozen waiting for you to kill them with ranged damage.

After exploring and uncovering the whole map (for now) and building a huge castle, a lovely farm and a cozy treehouse, I must say this game got me hooked. The mix of exploring, fighting and building in the current state is almost flawless. Everything we already got in the game works well and fits together. 
Sure, there's still work and balancing to do. On the long run, the fighting system could be a bit more varied and challenging with (more) bosses and animations. The NPCs should be more meaningful, maybe with more tasks (and moving) in your base. The building could need more possibilities (e.g. slopes). The world feels a bit empty; more residents and interactions or so would be great.
But hey, this is an EA and in my opinion one of the best I played in years!

By now I spent approx. 80 hours with this game, neglecting virtually everything else I had going on gaming-wise until I started Enshrouded. It got  me hooked. Big time.

Pros:
- Incredible building/housing system. The granularity in which you can design and craft your own home - whether it may be a tree house, a castle, a hidden cave system or a medieval village - is unprecedented by any game known to me. I'd call it revolutionary.
- Beautiful, large, hand-crafted maps including a lot of vertical world building which encourages exploration as (even good) loot is hidden around every other corner.
- The lighting is, while somehow the blooming kicks in a bit harsh and fog is where it's not supposed to be, one of the most beautiful I've seen in games so far.
- The combat system is fun! Besides a few things, you'll see them in the Cons section.
- Rewarding crafting system
- Good fast travel system, which requires you to strategically place your fast travel points while being limited to a certain number
- Various enemy times, which require different tactics - unless you play mage and 1-shot everything
- For an Early Access game, I had almost 0 bugs/hickups while playing the game for 80 hours. Only once, I fell through the map but were back in a safe space after a quick re-log.


Cons: 
- Some classes/builds are actually OP in comparison to others. E.g., the battlemage/paladin build shreds absolutely everything while being virtually immortal, rendering even lvl30 mobs and most bosses harmless and thus making the game way too easy. The hunter/ranger build is still fun and very viable, even in late game, but requires more movement and skill to excel. However, melee builds actually just suck. Which is very sad, as the melee gameplay mechanics are actually fun. But the damage output compared to the ranged builds mentioned above is just sub-par to say the least.
- Farming system is a bit tedious, as you have to manually plant, harvest and re-plant every single crop for itself. If you start farming big-time, e.g. Flax for Linen and Cloth, this tends to consume a lot of time.
- The building system, while being absolutely remarkable, still has some hickups now and then. Especially placing roof tiles can be tedious and sometimes, windows won't let themselves place in the spaces you would like them to be.

Neutral:
- Still lacks content - of course, it's in Early Access
- Quest process is tracked server-wide. Helps in keeping up with friends who play asynchronously, sucks for having the ""whole experience"" and might lead to some people skipping essential parts of the game. However, the devs already announced a potential solution to this.
- Prone to some... Let's not call it exploits but rather ""very convenient ways to play"". E.g., you can logout and login again to reset all chest cooldowns and therefore, given you placed a flame altar in the right spot, very quickly farm items that are supposed to be tied to some effort to get. 


All in all, Enshrouded is one of the - if not THE best - survival crafting action RPGs I've ever played.

Enemy variety is lacking, as is combat. 

Exploration felt great at first but it became pretty evident after a while that the payoff for certain things was kinda shallow. Once you find the new items in further out areas for your recipes, that's kinda it. Same issue Valheim had.

The shroud gimmick is interesting but overall holds no real dread once you figure it out. Death doesn't feel that impactful more than it feels like a time sink nuisance. The enemy variety and terrain is just lacking.

This game could go places for sure. The handcrafted spire towers with puzzles are sweet, traversal can be interesting considering you don't have a climb ability.

Just look at some reviews online to get an idea of what this game has to offer and decide for yourself if it is a good fit for you. If you think you will like it, you will like it.

Personally, I love the verticality, the traversal and the world itself. The concept of having the valleys engulfed in this thick fog where the unnatural stuff is going on while at the same time they present this beautiful world atop is just fantastic. Both the higher and lower parts of the world are full of places to find, scrolls with stories and hints to read and treasures to find. The way you can have a very sophisticated building options to make very detailed structures anywhere you want is also amazing.

At the time of this review (early access), its clear that the game is still evolving and that more advance systems, such as cooking, will become available soon. This doesn't detract from the great experience it already is. I hope this team keeps building this game and world forward.

- This is the only game I've seen that can't be streamed to the Steam Deck, or to virtually any device (PC/mobile/TV) using the Steam Link app. The game works as it should on the original device, but it just shows a white rectangle on a black background when streamed. This issue doesn't seem to be properly addressed yet.

- The game feels weird (in a bad way) when played at any framerate above the 60 FPS mark, as if half of the implemented things have a hard lock to 60 (camera, animations), while others don't. The developers have responded and acknowledged this problem, so we hope it will be fixed in time.

- This may be considered a nitpick, but the fact that Enshrouded uses a proprietary engine that packs all the game's data into a single file, and that the developers are not interested in supporting the community at all, this game will most likely never have any mods, just like their previous work, Portal Knights. While I fully understand how hard and time-consuming it would be to develop custom mod support, the team does not seem interested in helping the community support the game. Something as simple as allowing PC players to unpack the game's files is currently (and most likely forever) out of the question, which unfortunately makes this game automatically inferior to titles like Vallheim, Terraria, Necesse, Core Keeper, Subnautica, Palworld, and the list goes on and on.

Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of good things being done here, and the game is far from unplayable...if not streaming...but that's why I would love to see the game eventually become a diamond, not just a walled garden for players to have fun in only one selected way that the designers envisioned. This is a sandbox, and as such I believe it should be free in every sense of the word, whereas now there's little to no (world/server) customization of how you as a player are able to play.",1707651018,1707651018,False,1,0,0.483925551176071167,0,True,False,True

It has it ups for sure, the construction system is for the most part a little easier and more forgiving than Valheim (clearly it's biggest competitor) but the thing that is totally killing this game for me is the shroud, ironic I know.

That said, I feel like the developers have tried (and mostly succeeded) in integrating some of the best features of Valheim, Breath of the Wild, and even a hint of Dark Souls.  A lot of the mechanics remind me in a very good way of Valheim, but less grindy and with much much nicer graphics.  (Also, you're less clompy, can at least somewhat use stealth and play in a less tanky style -- if you want -- and etc.)  Building is also similar, though at this time it has no load limits or even gravity checking against floating parts.  (I wouldn't be surprised if they decide to change that later, so suggest against leaving stuff floating on purpose...)  I like the building in this a little better and there are some very nice block options, including the ability to manually place or remove an individual block for some pretty serious customization for those who have the patience and good prefab walls/etc for those who do not.  I'd like to see more actual options in there, but that's probably a thing that will come with time.

Actual gameplay is a bit of a mix between Valheim and even a hint of Dark Souls.  It's a somewhat dark world, but a better balance than the usual souls-likes (actual sunshine, beautiful areas, etc, but you have the ever present Shroud in valleys and deeper dungeons as well as the creatures associated with it.)  The world is populated with mostly hostile beings (other than rabbits and goats pretty much) so it can feel similar in many ways.  Also, some enemies will positively wreck you if you just stand there taking hits, so you'll want to dodge and that does use a highly significant amount of stamina that runs out all too fast.  That aside, the combat does feel a little more forgiving than Dark Souls and most enemies at least won't stunlock you so severely you are guaranteed death or one-shot you straight into immediate death (though there are those that come really close!)  I feel like it's actually a very well balanced system overall, though I wish the dodge-roll was a bit more controllable (it's easy to get stuck on an enemy trying to dodge around them.)

Exploring the landscape and the Shroud areas is quite an experience.  There are a [i]LOT[/i] of errors around the landscape (I desperately hope this gets fixed!) like floating stones, holes you can see through to the bottom of the world, etc etc all over the landscape, but if you keep an open mind about it, it's a huge and amazingly detailed world to explore.  I do wish we could climb ledges (I can understand no sheer face climbing in the BotW style -- that's actually borderline cheating and really changes dynamics, but if I could just climb over an edge I can reach it would be nice,) but otherwise it feels well made and balanced.  I just hope all those errors are fixed soonish...  I was excited to see how big the map is, but it seems huge portions are inaccessible in early access, which saddens me.  That will surely improve soon.

Full of things to explore and everything hides secrets and loot. It looks beautiful and base building is great, you can even take over pre existing buildings and even small cities. 

On the other side i don't like progression and resource gathering. It's way too slow and all over the place. It's basically a fetch quest to get the tools to make things you would need at first and you do that until the very end... Resource gather is MMO level except that you need way too much and way too many. Crafting tools and stations all require a plethora of different resources you can't just (for example) make a beehive and leave it. Nope you need to feed it sugar and water. Water is easy enough but sugar is an advanced resource you unlock basically at the end. Or to make padding needed to make final armour you need to unlock 3 different crafting stations, plant an insane amount of flax, make sure you keep some for seedlings, make linen with it, then leather, then fabric. And it's never a 1 to 1 ratio it's usually 1 to 5 so your resources just disappear and end up with a handful of the final one... The game NEEDS settings such as resource multipliers.

It scratches that itch you've got waiting on other things to update/release, it will play second fiddle to any other similar game only because it's not as smooth to play in any aspect as others.

Think of it like a janky Valheim.

Major points being:
- Combat isn't quite smooth, and wizard is stupid OP.
- Base building is dynamic but has several annoying steps to it, need to build walls before placing.
- Can only build around a specific placed object.
- Can only have 1 major crafting bench of each type in the whole world.
- There are SEVERAL crafting benches and refinement tables. (whyyyyyyy)
- Higher recipes need several steps and refinements to be crafted
- You can teleport around to placed structures.

The SHROUD part of the game is irrelevant once you understand its tied to the level of your base flame.

About 50% of your time is just running between POI's and spamming the loot key.

Now in detail: 
[list]
    [*][b]Graphics[/b] are really breathtaking (especially the views from the ancient towers) - one small improvement point would be the textures loading which sometimes takes a minute or two to happen after you land in a zone. 
    [*][b]Quests[/b] are quite interesting and bring you to discover all the locations through stories, dungeons, mines, farms, and more. Really enjoyed the armor gathering quest, I wish there were more but it's only EA.
    [*][b]Combat[/b] is fun and intuitive, allowing you to go from Ranger to Battlemage, to 2H Barbarian King to Archmage. Talents are well-designed, and progression is balanced.
    [*][b]Exploration[/b] is amazing, even if you do'nt follow quests. It becomes that much better once you get the glider and grappling hook of course but the game does a good job of bringing you quickly to those. The zone design is well-made, not empty, but also not overloaded with secret locations and extra activities. Enough to make you curious about ""What's that creepy-looking crypt over there?"" and come back 3 hours later after visiting half of the forest. The map size is crazy considering the early access, and the fact you see other zones WIP, it makes me impatient for the rest!
    [*]The [b]ambiance and music[/b] are just making the whole experience super immersive and wholesome.
    [*]The [b]farming[/b] isn't about crazy resource grinding (a little at the end but really not that bad) and it seems fair as stuff grows and gets produced while you're gone exploring anyway.
    [*]The [b]housing[/b] is just amazing. Infinite possibilities, and massive potential here if you're a builder. I could have written my whole review about it. There are just so many building blocks, decorations, and design possibilities with the voxels, and more for new players to discover. And as a solo player, having those NPCs for each workshop gives some life to the game. next level would be to see them interact in your house with chairs, workbenches, and such. 
    [*]My [b]only negative point[/b] would be the easiness of beating the last boss compared to how tough the first one could be if you didn't prepare. But it’s EA so fair enough, let's see what's coming. 
[/list]

You understand I spent those 50 hours with pleasure, got all the achievements and I still see so many things I want to do in this game. Kudos to the devs and I look forward to future updates.

As good as this game is, there are two things that I would love to change about it. I would like have a way to lower the density of the fog. I know it's a major mechanic of the game itself but I think it's sad that they worked on the visual design of the enshrouded areas and I really couldn't tell you anything specific about them unless I was just about standing on top of them.

Base building is above standard for most building games, exceeded only by EQ Landmark, which no longer exists, and Rising World, which does exist. 

All three are voxel based, which I think of as high res Minecraft, but has blueprints for some basic shapes to make it less tedious placing structures voxel by voxel, which you can do it you want. So whatever you can build in Minecraft, looks better if you build it in Enshrouded. 

If you don't like building, you can instead make your bases to include existing structures if you don't mind living in a fixer upper, which will probably involve removing the bones of the previous inhabitants.  I'm primarily a builder type, but nowhere near the league of the devs who made them.  Some of them are gorgeous.

I don't consider Enshrouded a survival game, unless you include every game where there is a possibility you can die. You can't die because of lack of food or water or lack of shelter from the elements. Having those things gives you buffs instead. You can go afk in a remote area for days.  You start in such a place and can teleport to it as well as other safe locations, including your bases.  

It has an RPG storyline and associated quests. While a lot of the story is often given in the form of notes, somewhat like Ark Survival Evolved but unlike Ark, these often notes trigger quests, or otherwise help you piece together what happened. You learn parts of the story from NPCs you rescue from a medieval version of cryopods, in which your character also awakens in.  You also learn parts of the story just from observing the very state of the world.

It has the grappling hook and glider from the Zelda games, but so does Ark. Unlike Ark, they are necessary to solve Zelda like puzzles, but if you've ever played them, they aren't too hard.

I bought the game primarily because of the building and the RPG aspects of it. RPGs are notoriously time consuming and expensive for developers to make so I generally expect years between expansions, in which I case I can spend that time building just because I think building is fun.

Now my review, I'd recommend this game to those that enjoy a survival game, from what I've played so far it is pretty easy to pick up and i have no issues with the controls. Getting the glider and grapple hook early makes a huge difference for exploring the map and after close to 11 hours playing we have only explored about 10-15% of the overall map.

The NPC's are a cool idea for progressing through the new gear tiers and having to run side quests for them actually makes it feel like your rebuilding something. I went for a tank build early and it complements my friends wizard build well. We have both enjoyed our builds but we can easily respec if we need too as well.

While I absolutely am in love with this game there are definitely pros and cons to it, though this game is still better and has more content than a lot of full release games out there even with the downsides.

The building is incredible! The snapping is better than most and there are so many options for pieces, furniture, and materials that one can go crazy with customization and creating gorgeous structures and villages. The terrain manipulation is also the easiest Ive ever used. The one thing that would make it better would to be able to rotate the pieces at a 45 degree angle for even more customization. I think its awesome you can go all minecraft and mine your way up a mountain or build underground tunnels and hobbit holes too.

The world is HUGE and breathtaking! Ive been playing for 26 hours and while I have been building a lot, I havent even completely explored the first area and its numerous POIs yet. Puzzles in the ruins arent pull your hair out difficult but they add a nice challenge to them. While there isnt much as far as fast travel, you can put down custom points with your altars. I think some form of mount, if its not something that comes later, would help make the exploration less grueling, though the glider definitely is fun and makes it quicker if you can be like Obi-Wan and find the high ground. The super bonus, pretty much everything is destructible and drops loot. Makes me a happy girl. <3

The combat isnt complex, but the skill tree and classes make it a bit more interesting as you can spend points in a focused manner or you can do a hybrid build. I definitely think there should be a bit more variety to the weapons, whether crafted or looted though.

I know a lot of people will want to play co-op but just a warning, the story progression is server based. If you just want to run around and explore with your friends though and dont care about the story, that option may work. That is not for me, but single player has been a blast anyway!

A couple of other suggestions Ive seen on other reviews that I just want to reinforce 

Add an in-game text chat

- The building is amazing

Cons:
- Game is hard capped at 60fps due to engine limitations.
- Horrific bloom/fog that washes out the entire game.
- Uses FSR1

And now to the deal-breaker that caused me to actually refund the game. The way they designed multiplayer which is the only way i'm interested in playing the game.

- Progress is tied to the server and only one person gets the reward chest after quests/dungeons/etc AND you can only have one instance of an NPC on the server AND you can only have two flame altars per server. 

- That means if your buddies play all night and you get on the next day your world will have progressed and you miss out on all the quests they did and you will be soft locked out of the progression. 
- And if you are part of the group that decided to play together only the person who opens the reward chest gets the reward. So you better spec differently then your group so you don't have to share a reward you need.
- You can only have one NPC type for the entire server, and if someone else summons the NPC while you are using them it breaks. 
- ANYONE can just walk up to your base node and select delete base and there's nothing anyone can do to stop that from happening.

The game forces you to focus more on exploring and less on building, then fails to reward you for doing such.
Enemy leveling scaling from one area to another is inconsistent with the way one should realistically progress through the areas. You could go from the starting area and encounter level 1 and 2 enemies, and then the very next area right next to it will have enemies that are level 5 and will one shot you, and there targeting is much better and more accurate than yours.

A progression system is non existent, as you can clear the whole game with the starting gear and legendary sword you get from the early POI, or you could just simply go down the mage route and cheese all bosses and POIs. The loot is useless and after getting all AIs and there upgrades, theres nothing to do aside from farm and make your base look nice. 

Im 16 hours in with around 10 of those hours being map exploration, and i still havent unlocked the whole map. In theory this would be a good thing, but unfortunately in this circumstance its purely due to us being given this HUGE map with a stamina limitation that takes 10-20 seconds to recharge every time you run out. Now there is was around this, such as food buffs and comfort (Just like valheim), but even those dont make up for just how much you need to explore. 

This game is 90% running around, no means of fast exploration aside from placing alter is every section of the map (which is a MUST), but you still need to run to these areas in order to place the alters. Stam for combat is fine, as it implements a skill requirement, but stam for PvE related actives is just pure annoyance and useless. You shouldnt have to wait 10-20 seconds to farm a tree to get 6 wood. 

Theres no insensitive to run POI's after the first time during a quest, as theres nothing in them that you'll need. The game punishes you for trying to progress before being a certain level with increased damage to you, and decreased damage to enemies. Enshrouded is by no means the first to do this, but it doesnt fit well here as leveling take FOREVER to do.

Overall: Game looks beautiful, Stam is horrendous forcing hours on just running and farming, No progression system or reason to revisit POIs, every boss can be cheesed, but at least you can build a cool house",1707625959,1707627068,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

For reference, I played this game as a mage with one friend through the playthrough, who was melee. For 90% of the playthrough he could tank everything and did more damage than I did. I realize this experience could vary, but I guess it depends on how you play, because we very much focused on the quests we had. I spent that same 90% of the game being completely squishy and being out dps'd by him.

The last 10%, I do way more damage, but the squishiness has never gone away. They recently released a patch nerfing water aura, which actually boggles my mind, because they literally could have just made it scale with the number of people in your party with it. It was the only thing keeping my survivability above 0. Anyway, you'll see people saying ""nerf mage"". That's nonsense. Mage doesn't need to be nerfed. Other classes need buffed. Or the mobs need nerfed.

I have several issue with this game, despite the fun I had early on, even getting destroyed.

1) As others pointed out, mob variety, yikes.
2) As others pointed out, why wouldn't I get annoyed and not feel challenged getting attacked by everything in the later game areas that can 1-2 hit me when they drop the EXACT same thing as mobs from the start of the game?
3) The map is *painful* to traverse. You give this freedom to traverse the map, but even mining your way tactically hurts, because the terrain feels like it's made out of fucking rubber bands and shoots you backward when you DON'T land on solid enough ground. 
4) An addendum to above, there are way too many ""time gatey"" type terrain features that feel cheap and only put there to slow your progress when going toward a quest. It's fine every once in a while, but by the 1000th mountain you've gone around or mined up, it's old, man.
5) The equipment upgrades feel lackluster
6) You don't feel a sense of power progression whatsoever, unless you're a mage, in which case, you're referring to acid bite, which will ALSO be nerfed in the future, per the devs... sooo?
7) An addendum to 4, the time to make materials feels arbitrarily long in some instances, like this is some kind of time gated mobile game and you're artificially expanding the run time for.... reasons?
8) The skill tree, there's too much there to talk about, but it needs reworked. The skills feel useless half of the time and some of them should be default included and/or moved around so as to not waste other skill points getting to certain things (double jump *cough*).
9) The storage: Good God, where do I start? There are magic chests that let you use resources from any of them, but that's only if you've made them ""magic"". That's fine in theory, but the problem is you can't fucking move anything without first emptying the chest. And inventory management in this game is horrendous, which leads to resource management being horrendous. And I understand that neckbeards that spend an hour organizing for every 10 minutes of gameplay might disagree, but for normal people, it feels bad.
11) This might be a limitation of the game engine or something, but the terrain terraforming with the rake is weird (this is a minor complaint)
12) I don't quite know how to articulate this, but it always feels like, when you're trying to traverse the map (I guess this could have gone with the point above about traversing the map) that your glider will come out at the worst time and the deadly shroud lava below has this MAGNET that draws your character toward it. I know it sounds absolutely insane and like some sort of skill issue, but I swear it's like this games physics are ACTIVELY TRYING TO KILL YOU.

All in all, I've had fun, but I've never had so much fun mixed with so much swearing over discord in one gaming experience. This game definitely needs more time in the oven.

PS: anyone saying mages need nerfed probably didn't play enough or played in groups of 3-5 people and don't speak for solo players or those playing with only one other person who ISN'T a mage.

PSPS: I left a negative review because of the current state after over 50 hours of gameplay. I don't normally leave reviews on ANY game, but I left one here because I sincerely believe this game has the potential to be amazing. And it is... at the beginning. I know it's early access, but what better time to leave a review, right? Anyway, if you disagree, dear reader, idgaf, you're wrong.",1707619437,1707621578,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game is good, but not great, at everything it sets out to do... with perhaps the exception of the building system, which is second only to Valheim in my experience. Because this game tries to do SO many things, it doesn't do any of them particularly well (relative to other popular crafting/survival games on the market). But it certainly does them all well enough to make it worth the asking price. You will get at least 50 hours of fun out of Enshrouded - possibly more for those who really enjoy engaging with different character builds or the sandbox/building elements beyond what is required to reach end-game. 

In-depth constructive criticism: 

In my opinion, the game would be SIGNIFICANTLY improved if the devs added more mob variety and boss encounters to make biomes and quest objectives feel more unique. As it currently stands, the player will see most of what the game has to offer in terms of combat experiences within the first 15-20 hours, after which every encounter begins to blend together and become a source of fatigue rather than encouragement to press forward to bigger and better experiences (because at that point it is obvious there are none). 

Also, it quickly becomes obvious that the devs relied HEAVILY on elevation as a pathing obstacle to reach quest or other objective way-points. Once you've learned the entire map, this no longer presents a problem, but until you reach that point, it's incredibly annoying to keep running into mountains or cliff walls that you have to reroute yourself around simply because you didn't take the specific route you were intended to take to get there. Yes, you can technically force your way through an unintended path by mining your way through it, but often times the obstacle is far too steep/tall/dense for that to be realistic or an efficient use of time. So basically, those static conditions are juxtaposed with a voxel based world where ostensibly you are encouraged to engage with terrain manipulation. And because of that, there aren't actually very many moments where I feel like it's worth engaging with it at all. In a standard action RPG, rigid/defined pathing might be expected, but it doesn't make sense in the context of the features on offer with this title.

Update: The overall game balance is total garbage at end-game. There was a STEEP drop-off in quality in the final 10 hours. Mainly due to balance reasons, this game will need a LONG time in the oven to reach it's full potential.",1707269523,1707619618,True,0,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,True

 When getting all the achievements the shrines and sanctums in revelwood and springfields was really hard to discern. Since I started getting them after having access to pretty much the whole early access map and already going to a lot of areas. The combat could get some work since most early game enemies you can just walk past and not get hit. And then later there are some enemies you can't even run from without getting hit and possibly dying. And then magic getting a big amount of damage compared to warriors. Areas also don't feel like you need to loot them sometimes more than once, unless you really wanna get a midtier armor set that is most times overshadowed by the crafted one that you'll get a bit later.

Overall I feel like I got my moneys worth. I'm looking forward to seeing what this game has to offer as it progress through EA and launches.

Basically, combat in the game is a gear check. Enemies will stick to you like glue during combat; rather than enemies having interesting abilities or movement patterns that you can take advantage of, they will zip toward you and initiate heat-seeking melee attacks which are either countered by blocking or hitting the dodge key. That might sound pretty par for the course, but in practice it just turns into the aforementioned gear check. 

Do you have the DPS (gear) to kill them before your stamina runs out? Since stamina recharges painfully slow (and I mean PAINFULLY SLOW), combat turns into a binary ""kill them before your stamina depletes or you lose."" Ergo: it's a gear check.

That wouldn't necessarily be a problem if the game didn't have the most obtuse and annoying progression system I've ever seen in a survival game. Rather than having a clear path on how to gear up your character, all of your recipes are locked behind quests and there's no indication of what you should do next. Other survival games are straight forward: if you have a set of copper gear and it's not good enough, you go hunting for the next tier of metals to level up. 

In Enshrouded, that's not the case. See, in this game there are NPCs that you unlock, which allow you to craft more advanced items. Unfortunately, these NPCs left all their crap strewn about the world map and everything is connected to everything else. You can't just craft a new set of mage gear once you've unlocked the NPC that creates mage gear. You've got to rescue the hunter and the carpenter NPCs, then go on several quests to find all their missing equipment, which will then allow you to craft requisite materials with them, which unlocks the ability to traverse further into the map, which then unlocks another quest for your mage buddy, which then allows you to farm a separate crafting material, which then allows you to finally craft the next tier of gear...

But enemies will still hit you like a truck and all that's changed is you can now kill enemies that have a slightly higher number above their head. 

I eventually got fed up with this system after exhausting all of my quests, crafting all the gear that the game has allowed me to unlock, and then I got to a boss that resists all my attacks and still hits me for half my health. It could be the case that I'm still undergeared for this fight, but it's impossible to tell because I have the best possible items that the game allows me to have at this point. 

It's a shame, because the game is quite addictive and the building system is amazing. Hopefully the devs use the early access period to make their combat/progression systems not suck.",1707612957,1707612957,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

I don't know why they bother letting you create a character name.  Once you're in-game other players see you only as your Steam handle.   That's hardly immersive.

I felt really nervous getting this game because of the push of spells and magic but turns out, you don't have to do that which is really good, I myself will never wield magic or any principles of darkness to fight darkness. The map of Enshrouded is really huge and this is early access, dang, this game is going to be so good once it hits 1.0.

As far as I've seen and played the game, no blood and if there is, barely visible but I've seen no blood. Graphics are beautiful to look at, main menu and in-game soundtrack is really pretty. The survival and grinding aspect of Enshrouded is quite easy. Sure, some of it can be hard but it's not too difficult to master. The combat is up to you, there's a couple of choices. Character customisation is there but very limited, no customisation for the eyes etc.

In terms of game performance, for me, it runs really well, some stutters but barely there. I won't give anything away but heed my warning, never travel into the red shroud, just saying lol. The blue shroud you can explore as far as I believe but there looks to be a timer of how long you can stay in it before dying I'm guessing.

Enshrouded is a great game, I can highly recommend it to those that enjoy Valheim or just like the survival and Monster Hunter combat feel of the game. I'm a solo player for now so nobody can come into my world and troll, you can make it private which is very good. I only recommend playing Enshrouded with friends and family, random players I've heard will come into your session and trash your base, could be wrong but I think that's what I've heard? But don't be put off, this game is amazing, give it a go and see how you like it. This is probably the best game purchase I've made in a long time.

Now to end my review, here are my cons of Enshrouded so far...

1. Character Customisation very limited.
2. Resources need a much faster respawn rate. Make it instant the next day or every few minutes at least.
3. Needs patches for better game performance.
4. Enemy NPC's get stuck inside things then being unable to fight back.
5. Enshrouded could use some custom world settings, make it the way you want it to be to suit everyone's play style, being hardcore mode, survival, creative then custom. 

5/5

While it may not boast an intricate narrative, the game excels in delivering a peaceful yet challenging singleplayer experience.

The open-world design of Enshrouded is a true testament to the beauty of simplicity. The landscapes are expansive and diverse, offering a picturesque backdrop for your survival journey. From dense forests to serene lakeshores, every corner of the game world feels meticulously crafted, inviting exploration and discovery.

Survival enthusiasts will appreciate the game's focus on realistic mechanics, where resource management, crafting, and environmental awareness are key to thriving in this untamed environment. The absence of a complex storyline allows players to shape their own narratives through their actions and decisions, fostering a unique and personal gameplay experience.

Enshrouded's minimalist approach extends to its gameplay mechanics, providing a smooth and accessible experience for players of all skill levels. The absence of a heavily scripted plot allows for a more laid-back and contemplative gaming session, perfect for those seeking a break from the fast-paced intensity of other titles in the genre.

The ambient sounds and calming soundtrack complement the game's atmosphere, enhancing the sense of solitude and connection with nature. Enshrouded is a breath of fresh air for those who appreciate the meditative qualities of a solo survival experience without the distractions of a complex narrative.

In conclusion, Enshrouded may not be your traditional narrative-driven game, but its simplicity, beautiful landscapes, and focus on immersive survival gameplay make it a tranquil retreat for gamers looking to unwind and enjoy the beauty of a virtual wilderness.

Worth it?  Absolutely.
There is enough content and enjoyment from the game to easily justify the price; early access or not.  The graphics are good, vibrant, fun, appealing to the eye.  The voxel world is smooth, enjoyable to explore, and has a lot of fun hidden items all over the place.  It is a bit challenging at first but once you figure out the rules of the game and utilize all your potions and resources to their full advantage that is when it gets really fun.

Base building is good, but roofs are clunky but I'm not sure I've played a base builder where that wasn't true.  There are some obvious pain points with the building system I think they have heard enough about to address  in the future; can't overwrite existing parts, some parts hard to place, graphics don't always even/level out on both right and left side of a model, etc.

Combat is good, but a bit slow at times - input control response could use a bit of tweaking, but take note that your play style will affect your combat experience as well.  If you're older and ARPGs are difficult because of their speed, (like me) you'll probably want to shield and wand/sword it for a bit, but keep a bow handy for some of the dungeon puzzles.

Enemies aren't hard, and relatively few in variety, but again - this point was already made by other players well before me.

I definitely recommend it and it is a lot of fun.  Take your time.  Don't rush.  There's a lot of world to  explore even in EA mode.",1707599792,1707599792,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The graphics are smooth and pretty to look at, while i would recommend one notch below max quality because the performance hit is a lot for an extremely small payoff graphically. My favorite part is how good the building in this game is. It can be as basic as you need, to quickly build  while giving you the nuanced options also that allow you to fine tune your buildings to a ridiculous level of nitpickiness. (yes, its a word) the experience and leveling system needs some tuning, and maybe some tweeks to the overall progression/recipe system too. but honestly, i'm finding it hard to do anything but praise this game.

Perhaps its biggest strongsuits are the freedom of a carefully crafted world and one of the most liberating building mechanics I have ever seen paired with the liberty to make anywhere you want your own dominion is a masterpiece in itself. In a dead tie is the skill tree and it is genius, because this opens up doors in the world of video games to me atleast in the aspect charater creation and your role in this world and truly lets you take on the game in many different play strategies, and its fluid!! You can be a little bit of a warrior and a support player, and often change your playstyle when needed.
   However It has a tailored meh story line which isnt really a story and is just a manner of ways to upgrade what kind of tools and crafting abilities are. this is its biggest downfall so far. Perhaps this is deliberate, to maintain the be whoever and do whatever you want feeling. I feel as though that there could be a more valuable sentiment behind these NPCs. My suggestion is the ability to be more like a base companion, instead of a glorified mission board and crafting table. Perhaps this is already in the works as it just seems to be a no brainer feature. In addition while the combat styles are vast and many, it lacks in making any single one of them very special for some reason. alot i think has to do with the shallowness of the animations in combat. The enemies look cooler fighting lol.

There are a lot of problems with hosts on G Portal (no connection from clients possible) and there are save issues with lost progress even after the latest update.

Update 2024-02-10:
All the updates to fix savegame issues don't seem to have worked. We just had an issue on our G-Portal dedicated server where one character didn't see a tower where you can port to anymore. Re-joining doesn't work, there is an infinite loading screen. Restarting the server still causes an infinite loading screen for the affected player and even with another newly created character the server can't be joined anymore. Either the server restart or another issue also caused lost progress of several hours on the server which was just reported by another player who is able to join.
Joining a local game is still possible, however the save state is completely broken. The revealed map was that of the dedicated server while some quests for carried over others were not and all spawn points are not shown.

It has already a huge map with many spots to explore, you can build at nearly every spot in the game because of the digging system which is a little bit like Minecraft (You can destroy most of the things in the game) and have many material choices for your base. Sadly you first need to find the blocks for building with them and some are just endgame right now. Other negative point is the number of weapons in each category. There are just like 10 different weapons of each one, but its still early access and im sure there will come much more (at least I hope so). Also the balancing feels a little bit awkward right now, because in our run there were some enemies which are like level 20 and oneshots but then there are level 25 enemies which are like useless compared to others. There are still a lot of points which can be optimized but the game is overall pretty good and I hope it will have a good future. I dont know what I should think about the multiplayer. You cant place more than one NPC of each, the loot and quests are not separate sadly. The Shroud roots shouldnt respawn per player imo. The plots should be for each player and you should need a permission for building on the plot of each other or using the chests (especially the magic chests for using the materials for crafting). Other point are the fire altars which are not marked when you already got them (it was pain doing the fire altars for the achievements for one of us lmao).

It has its moments of fun, the world is beautiful and it has a handful of neat ideas that definitely work and makes this game stand out from the crowd. However, almost every single system feels underwhelming or boring.

Combat is incredibly basic and boils down to spamming left click until the enemy dies. There are only a couple of enemy types, and after a couple of hours you'll have seen them all. Crafting can be nice as it's all on a timer, but it's a very long waiting game. Quests are plenty, but their objectives are as basic as they could possibly be and the story of the game is conveyed through boring lore notes you can find. Honestly, I only clicked on them for the 10 xp. Balance is an issue, as some spells feel very underwhelming while another one-shots the biggest bosses of the game. Gear looks cool but sometimes takes insane amount of resources to craft (looking at you, flax).

On the other hand, building in this game seems to robust and work very well, though I have not taken the time to build a lot yet, The world is beautiful and full of things to do and find, but these things are often just not very interesting.

I think Enshrouded has the potential to become something great, but as of now, my experience with the game boils down to ""I'm only playing this because I want to reach the end, but I'm not having fun doing so"". It was all just very 'meh'. Wait until the full release or a sale.",1707595556,1707596226,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game is well-made and I didn't have any particular problem with it. But it's also not what I was expecting. They seem to be advertising the ""open-world"", ""survival"", ""base building"" aspect (literally the top three user-defined tags I see on it right now) but this is no 7d2d. It's also not Valheim. It's more like a tightly guided RPG that happens to include base building because that's what the cool kids are doing these days. There's not much actual point to the base building that I can see. In 7d2d you NEED a good base to survive the zombie hordes. Valheim has raids too. This game just....has bases....because reasons? I find their thrall system annoying too. (Who are these people. Why are they kinda jerks. Why can't they go be a little more useful. Blacksmith is basically just a crafting table who tells me to do stuff and talks smack.)

Combat is very ""clicky-clicky action RPG"". Well done enough, if you're into that sort of thing.

Open world? Eh. I guess if you consider World of Warcraft to be open world. I mean there is a world, but you are rather specifically guided through it with quests and the vertical nature of the game preventing you from going where you're not supposed to go yet. (Or there's shroud that kills you REALLY FAST if you try, and not much warning when you enter it. Maybe not QUITE as annoying as your first encounter with a bee in Valheim, but it do be like that sometimes. ""You shouldn't be here. Now you're dead."") Feels way more ""on rails"" than even Valheim was.

So you CAN make a nice building if you want to but really a flat slab with crafting tables and annoying NPCs to tell you what to go do next should cover your actual needs. And the ""survival"" aspect is really more like you need to eat and drink to get buffs that makes combat easier.

It isn't the standard survival game, it's entire focus is on following through the quest line regarding the Elixer, and working with the NPC's you bring to your base to unlock new technologies.  Food and water simply provide buffs to your stats, and aren't necessities.

If you've played the developer's previous game, Portal Knights, you know just about what to expect, with some improvements to the overall flow and building process, though with less overall NPCs to place at your base.  Exploring the singular world instead of a series of worlds provides a bit more of a sense of joy in exploration, and the BOTW style glider adds even more.

I do have a few complaints, though I have a feeling they'll be resolved throughout the Early Access process: First, the quest progression overall could use some work.  The starting flow and introduction to the Wells is pretty great, but the ending in particular just kind of fizzles out without any real direction.
Second, the existence of only one level of deadly shroud makes understanding the progression of the flame levels a little bit unclear.  Combined with only a brief explanation of how flame levels work in general can definitely lead to some issues with knowing where it's going to be safe to explore.
Third, the building and terrain deformation can be a bit of a pain to work with, and creating pieces that connect together would be nice, especially for aesthetic pieces.  For example, creating a connected fence around a farm plot is virtually, if not realistically, impossible.

For me, these are very minor complaints.  This game is all about exploring and enjoying the world and lore that the developers have put together.

- The base building is very good.  You have a lot of control to make exactly what you want.  You can build completely from nothing, or restore existing buildings and modify them however you want.
- The combat is responsive.  It's not ""dark souls"" level boss fights but it's very good for this type of game.
- The progression system(s) are good.  You slowly get better gear, weapons, and upgrades like better gliders and grapple hooks.
- You add ""people"" to your base which unlock more crafting options and send you on quests to get even more crafting options.
- Loot is somewhat randomized, as you open chests and kill enemies you'll find better and better loot of different rarities. 
- Food is actually VERY useful.  The buffs you get make a huge difference and are very much worth farming (yes game has farming) materials to make the good stuff!

With base-building, a farming simulation, and a Zelda like adventure, the game is trying to do too much, imo, so each aspect is not only limited but the game forces you to do things in a certain order. You can't just go anywhere and do anything, the game railroads your experience.

After two hours I was already bored of the combat. Tab targeting is so dated, and stale. Press tab, spam click till things die. Fought the same three things the whole time. Wolf, spear/sword guy, crossbow guy. There is no risk, no death penalty, no need to survive. 

Pros: Building seems like it is actually pretty good. Rather tedious to do with how it's set up, but not as bad as some other games. Worse than Valheim, better than Ark. The terrain digging is actually great. 
The world looks pretty good, and is very large. Good for people who like to explore. 

Cons: Tab Targeting in a ""survival"" game? The combat needs a complete overhaul. The different weapons don't even have different attack patterns. All of them are identical. Magic and ranged is stupid OP when you quite literally don't have to even aim. You can 100% play this game without any thought. While the assets they used to make the world look nice, do in fact look nice, they're the same ones reused over and over. I'm sure if I spent another few hours looking around, I'd see more interesting things, but the game is already bored me to the point I've lost all interest in even trying. If the combat gets a complete overhaul, I might give it another try, but until then this one sits as a regret in my libary.",1707586689,1707586689,False,1,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,True

The building is solid.  Super solid.  Needs more shapes, but that's a tiny issue.

Combat can get a little clunky around the edges.  Wizarding owns all, and stealth needs some love.

Terraforming is fantastic and fun to dig around in.

Resources get a little tedious later on, but are plentiful and easy to find/manage.

So far, 16 hours in, I haven't run into any placeholder items or roadblocks, I have yet to find any bugs and the game seems stable. It's what early access should be - tweaking a mostly finished game, adding more based on what they have, and getting feedback.

Enshrouded has been an enjoyable experience so far, it focuses on exploration with little surprises everywhere which is why I'm glad they decided to go with an art directed map instead of the more common procedurally generated ones. It takes alot of inspiration from breath of the wild as well as bits and pieces from other survival games where it works. If you want something that falls between an open world RPG and a survival game, this ones for you.

As for the feedback to the dev team - I would like to see more fleshing out of the quest system so groups can complete quests separately and still get credit rather than requiring people to all be online on the same server or local hosted game. A little more division of NPC levels would be nice too, I've been all around the southern part of the map and it seems to jump from levels 1 to 3 to 5 to 7 and sometimes it feels a bit out of order based on proximity to the starting location. But overall I'm just glad that this doesn't seem to be like other early access where the devs just take a dump in front of you and say ""give us money now and help us fix our shit.""

I really like the voxel-based world structure.  The build and discovery mechanics which it enables are great.  

I hope we unlock some better food types soon, but really expect that just means we've not progressed far enough yet to get the right crafting gear.  The food, rest, and potion mechanisms are a convenient way to improve stats temporarily without necessarily being an instant death when we forget to take care of them, so long as we are careful about which enemies we engage without proper preparation.

Even the death mechanism is a boon to gameplay.  On death, you lose some convenience or crafting items (they are in a tombstone you can go collect where you died) but you don't lose your weapons, foods, or hotbar items.  Even losing a body somewhere that you can't successfully retrieve it is a mere nuisance rather than a real problem.

It would need another year or two of content updates, more variety of enemies, more dungeons or similar content, maybe an improved weapon variety system, some talent tuning, for it all come together in a great package.
The world is beautiful and having a glider and a grappling hook to use opens up a lot of options for exploration. Climbing a tower, beating it's puzzles and being rewarded with a teleportation point, revealing some points of interest in the map and the shroud, and then being able to jump off the tower and glide as far as you can feels good. There is a natural desire to see a settlement and want to poke around in it. My exploration was rewarded more than it wasn't, but the quality of these rewards isn't always the best. Maybe it's the difference between solo play vs as a group, but after I have found a solid set of weapons and upgraded them, finding a salvagable weapon doesn't mean much to me. This for me circles back to ""the base is fine, but it needs more"" which is my recurring complaint.
Not having a weight limit for the things you carry was a very, very good choice. Being able to upgrade my backpack slots was the right call. Being able to teleport back with everything I have and put everything into my primary base feels better for me than something like Valheim. Valheim incentivizes many bases or treading the sea to get your high value ores back home. A different approach to the gameplay design with neither being inherently bad. Enshrouded lets me explore as far as I can and when I'm done, I can put down one of my limited two way teleportation point to return there afterwards.

The main issues are with the size of the in game character, lack of options surrounding camera movement and the overall janky-ness of the game... The voxel building is great, but after realising you can't permanently the main world and are restricted to areas under your flame (of which you only have 2), with the rest of the world being reset every few hours, the game world felt stagnant, unfulfilling and insiginficant and  total step back from the game it was inspired by... Being bound to 2x 100x100m flames was underwhelming to say the least, I expected a fully open world that I could permanently change and build upon..... what's the point of a large open world if only allowed to modify a few designated segments with the rest being reset every few hours, or whenever the world is loaded......Unsurprisingly we didn't see anything in the launch trailer about the game resetting the world to default each time you load the game....... A total step back from valheim and other survival games..

Enshrouded was over-hyped by the devs who knowing released it in a poor state.... They are cashing out on the idea of a modifiable, voxel open world RPG before bothering to finish the game or surpassing the games they were obviously influenced by...... There were heavy reminders of Valheim and eldin ring/dark souls but this game failed to nail either of those and in the end I just wanted to go play either valheim or eldin ring. I seriously wish all the best to these devs, but the lies, clever marketing and pretending to listen to the community aren't going to win majority of people over currently because as this game stands, it's a waste of time and not worth putting hours into unless you are into a shallow story, building pointless...

No mounts and fast-travel locked behind way-points aka Valheim teleportation gates. Yet it can still be fun if you looking for an quest driven adventure with interesting crafter, farmer, builder mechanic on top.

Read on if you want more details.

Most important! The world progress does not save. Everything outside your base resets upon exiting the game. Quest progress is currently server side, when completed cannot be done by other players. Quest cannot be completed but the quest progress and impact in the real world resets. For example the quest tells you to go clear a shroud infestation. You do that, open a fast travel ability form shroud after clearing the shroud infestation and have a safe location inside a shroud now. Exit the game, comeback and the area reset. The quest shows complete but the area is now covered in shroud again and fast travel option is gone. How am I suppose to combat the ""shroud?"" This was the quest introducing me to the ability to clear areas. Like WTF? Is it because this is PS5/Xbone game and incapable of saving vast open areas and alternation to the world? I can remove and entire mountain in Valheim and it will be gone forever. Yet clearing a small portion of land is reset 30 minutes later in Enshrouded. Again this is something developers wanted I guess, maybe that is the gameplay they are aiming at.

Since then the developers decided that in the near future they will introduce an option to at least keep quests player side. Not sure if the world will be affected by this, I doubt it.

World reset can of course lead to exploitation and easy leveling progress.You can set up your first base near first boss or resource node and after 10 min of farming by exiting to title and back you have a fairly high level base or large supply of resources.

1. The UI feels like a poor console port or designed by someone who has never worked on PC RPG UI. It takes up a whole screen, everything feels big and over-sized like driving an amarican car. It feels like Fable inventory screen or Dark Souls. Not PC first. There is a lot of clicking and key pressing. For example pressing I does not take you to inventory but opens whatever tab that you used last. Opening a chest, you have to click escape to close it. Do you know where ESC key is? It is far. To change gear you have to click on the equipped piece of gear, that will take you to another screen where you can compare and select an upgrade to equip. You cant tell simply by hovering over gear items.

2. Graphics, it looks alright for 2024 it is pretty but nothing amazing. Valheim has better atmosphere. People having optimization problems and FPS locked at 60 for some. Developers working to fix it. There is no full screen it is only border-less. Again graphically speaking smells like console limitations or developers inability to optimize or poor in-house engine. No weather effects, only day and night changes.

3. Buildings look great, if you want to spend a lot fo time building then this is a very cozy and fun time sink. BUT, the clipping and connecting points is such a sensitive and annoying process.

4. NPCs that join you are stationary objects, they are like workshop stations/desks. They do not do anything other than stand in one place. Palworld came out a week earlier and you have dozens of NPCs running around your base being productive members of the world and not just another piece of furniture or a workbench. further you can take Palworld npcs with you and go adventuring. Enshrouded NPCs literally a workbench with silly one liners. You just do not care who or what they are, they do not even have names.

5. Combat is alright. Nothing too deep and easily accessible. Think Fable/Valhaim, not Dark Souls. you can kite everything or get it stuck on terrain, including bosses. Cant be helped you got a pickax for a reason. you got roaming packs at night similar to Valheim.

6. Character design... I mean you play a human. For some reason he is small. I guess inbreeding or the blue miracle juice they been all sipping on. Perhaps experimental gene therapy vax. I do not know but legs shorter than torso. Story is you are a hybrid a new human lol. Maybe developer was going for the Zelda cute style, but got drunk half way through designing. Also you can glide, jump, and climb only ladders or nets. You can not climb like Zelda. Feels very restrictive.

7. Crafting. Seriously there are way too many craft screens. Is it bad? Not if you love crafting station. I just wish it was a bit smoother to navigate the UI does not help it. You got 2 personal craft workbenchs, you got hammer (think Valheim workbench) you got 2 workbench workbenchs, you got 2  workbenchs pet npc and you got ingredients workbenches on top of that upgrade weapons workbench. No universal inventory like in Palworld until you unlock at this point end of EA NPC. It is such a useful function why lock it behind quest. If you love workbenches this game will scratch your workbench autism. It is not bad but a bit overwhelming and UI is annoying to navigate. Is it fun, sure like all crafting game it is fun and I would say it is a lot better than what Palworld has to offer that game crafting is bare-bones and it is on par with Valheim.

8. It is EA so a lot may or may not change. It is fun like most builder/crafter/gathers games are. It can be addictive. But a lot of poor design implementation seem way too silly.

If money is an issue wait a while for developers to make this better. If money is not an issue then buy it and support developers now.

They got a lot of work to do, it is a fun game and I hope they can make it better. I would wait to buy it unless you really have the itch for crafting game now.",1706183426,1707549240,True,0,0,0.503470301628112793,0,True,False,True

The collaboration adds a dynamic element to the gameplay, encouraging players to strategize, share resources, and tackle formidable challenges together. 
The seamless integration of co-op mechanics enhances the overall experience, fostering a sense of camaraderie and shared accomplishment.

The fog, a central element in the game, serves as both a visual spectacle and a formidable adversary. 
Its dynamic nature keeps players on their toes, constantly adapting to the changing environment and presenting unexpected challenges. 
Navigating through this ever-shifting fog creates an intense and immersive experience, ensuring that players remain engaged and alert.

The game's emphasis on vanquishing punishing bosses adds a satisfying level of difficulty. 
Each encounter feels unique and requires strategic thinking, as players must learn the patterns and weaknesses of these formidable foes. 
The sense of accomplishment upon defeating a boss is palpable, and the rewards gained contribute to the progression and customization of the player's character.

Enshrouded also incorporates a building aspect, allowing players to construct grand halls and fortifications. 
This adds a layer of creativity and personalization to the game, as players can shape the world around them and establish a stronghold against the encroaching darkness. 
The balance between survival, combat, and construction offers a diverse and engaging gameplay experience.

In conclusion, Enshrouded You Are successfully combine co-op survival and action RPG elements, delivering an immersive and challenging experience.

Now that sure sounds like a closing statement of a well thought out explanation for a brand new game that hasn't even scratched the surface of its own possibilities.

Because that is the most important statement I will say in regards to this game, and it should be front and center. 

The developers of this game have crafted a masterpiece. Simple, yet effective combat. A vast, original world to explore with lore and beauty spread throughout. A very well thought out skill tree, with the freedom to try different paths throughout your playthrough.  An array of enemies to keep you on your toes. One of the best building mechanics, and decor concepts that other similar games seem to lack. And I truly could go on.

It's got quite a few similarities to games like Valheim, Skyrim or even Dark Souls. If you enjoy any of those 3 games, you may like this title. I will say, there are a few things that can be done better:

1. Enemy variety isn't great. You'll encounter some of the same enemies across all biomes, just scaled by level. That's not too interesting honestly. Also there are few real bosses to fight, the demibosses seem repeated across biomes.
2. Quests often make you run for long distances to find the entrance to a building or cave. Running simulators aren't for me usually.
3. If you don't get a rested bonus and consume the proper food, stamina becomes a real issue and it can be frustrating to fight some enemies. Some swing incredibly quickly and spam attacks that outpace a melee user/2-handed weapon user & stun-lock you.
4. Your base/home is never tested by enemies or the environment. It never rains or storms. So why build something other than a wood hut? There is no real need to use other stronger building materials since they're there for aesthetic purposes only.
5. Melee builds are just straight up weaker than archer/mages. Your damage is lower, and you are victim to stamina drain. Armor doesn't feel like it truly makes you tanky. This is my personal feeling.",1707542661,1707542661,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,True

Took about 70 hours and that's with me sort of 'roomba-ing' around every area I could.  I didn't do any of the cheesy stuff that youtubers and streamers were doing to get the best gear, either, just a straight solo playthrough.

The game's fun.  It's got some bugs, some graphical glitches, typical things you'd expect with early access, but on the whole it's very polished for the price of admission.  It's Valheim but with authored content.  You're goal is basically to beat the bosses.  That's pretty much it.  There's a narrative in the background, but it's very disjointed relegated to reports and letters you find all over the map.

My gripes + suggestions/feedback:  
>There aren't enough enemy types.  Running into the same wolf, the same scavengers, the same enshrouded zombies over and over again got old by hour 15.  The different biomes should have more variations of these enemies, if not new ones.
>The bosses are underwhelming.  They're very predictable, very cheeseable, and you fight the same 3 bosses over and over again.  The reaper boss is the most interesting one but you only see them a couple times at endgame.
>Combat timing for blocks/strikes is wonky.  You'll miss blocking attacks you know you should have blocked and enemies often outright ignore the damage you're doing to them.  They'll block you so you can overpower them but this mechanic doesn't feel rewarding, despite spec'ing into things that should make it easier to do.
>2 Handed weapons aren't very good.  The animation times make them almost useless in the late game.  The Barbarian skill tree specifying hammers is also odd.  Bow and arrow is underwhelming.  Magic is very OP.
>The base building is just there to check a box.  We need raids or some other mechanic to justify ever using anything beyond the basic wood structures you start with, along with base defenses or maybe arming the NPCs we've rescued to help defend.  I never once felt a single urge to upgrade any of the material in my base.
>Some of the super rare gear you can find at level 25 (Paladin, Elder, and Eagle Eye) has pieces that don't make sense.  The Paladin gloves, for example, are worse than the Soldier gloves.  A bit more armor doesn't make up for the crit bonus loss.  It would be nice to have some sort of crafting mechanic to add and adjust the perks of gear and weapons.
>Upgrading your pickaxe and felling axe feels so underwhelming.  When I got the Iron Pickaxe I thought I'd at least be mining more quantity of non-Iron ore at a much higher rate, but that's not the case.  It doesn't feel any different than the rusted one I started with, other than, yes, you can now mine the higher thing.  Make upgrading these tools feel more worthwhile.
>The authored content is great, but it makes the game a mostly one-off experience.  I was hoping for more randomization to mix up the experience.
>The shroud itself is mostly a paper tiger.  You're fighting a timer more than what's actually in it.  There should be more reasons to make the player want to go in there.  You'll max out your level far before you finish the Elixir wells, so at a certain point doing those is kind of pointless.  This comes down to needing better balance.

If you're on the fence, it's a good game, it's worth picking up, but it needs more time in the oven.  Most of the map isn't ready yet but clearly there's at least 60+ hours there as-is and more is coming down the pipe, so that's enough for me to recommend it.

One quest asks you for materials with no guidance on how to acquire them. 
Another sends you into an area with mobs that can 1-shot you through a shield block.
It does not help that it tends to crash every hour or so, and the crash sometimes mortally wounds Steam or other running apps.  One time it crashed Steam so hard Steam forgot that it had game installed on drives other than C: and I had to re-add the drives.  It routinely cripples Discord, causing me to lose voice chat with friends.

The cycle of 
*die
*teleport home
*get rested buff
*teleport near the battle
*run back to the enemies
gets pretty tedious.

They also need to figure out a satisfying sink for spare torn cloth and other resources that accumulate in the storage chests of loot goblins.

I hope they figure out how to pace the game.  Even Valheim wasn't this bad (at least Valheim has Hugin to give you guidance).

One of the better survival building systems with a theme/aesthetic I like. While there is MUCH more than I expected in alpha/beta, I just have to wait for them to release more. Hoping for more furniture and placeable items (like food, signs, other decor). I would love to see them add more npcs, even just regular commoners you can assign to some tasks while you're running around adventuring. Farm animals. A better fencing system that actually lines up...

The graphics are great. The combat has more variety than I've seen in any survival game, along with a skill tree. Though it doesn't do too much for me, since I'm more focused on building. I find the skills aren't really useful late game. I love stealth and was happy to see a sneaking ability, but as soon as you trigger one, you pretty much trigger them all. You're not guaranteed an instakill. The enemies notice you too easily even when im crouching in the brush, so I just go a mix between them all.

As you progress and level up your main camp, you unlock more resources and exploration. More materials and more flames you can set down to establish yourself in, and use as fast travel markers. The map size is quite large when maxed out, and if you settle down where there is a prefabricated object or building, it becomes yours. You can leave it as is, delete it entirely, or build around it. Things will only reset if they're important items (like lore scrolls and books). Chests do not reset at all. 

This game gives you more control/flexibility than most building games. You can build by single units, or predetermined shapes (wall, doorways, small block, thick slab, etc). It will automatically fill in around edges with trimming, such as doorways. Snapping to grid makes things super easy, but you can unsnap for those odd angles or unique details.

In most respects, it's feels like a better Valheim. Combat feels better and is more nuanced, graphics are better (with some bugs here and there), exploration is more rewarding, you can move SO MUCH faster, no tanking framerates from being in town, etc.

Upgrades/leveling is a mixed bag. I enjoyed having a skill tree with perks to sink into, but ultimately I felt that I didn't really need the vast majority of them. While I didn't do so, it feels 100% possible to beat the entire game without upgrading your skill tree at all.

Base building, while occasionally frustrating, is very enjoyable, lots and lots and lots of customization, and when you get your home looking just right... *chef's kiss*. That being said, similar to the perk tree... there's really no reason to do any of that if you don't want to. Very easy to build just the essentials and skim by. No enemy raids on your base, no helpful perks for using rarer materials to build. It's all just for show and personal taste.

Equipment is... odd. Not going into extreme detail as it would be tedious to read, but suffice it to say that you will need to experiment to really figure out what use and how to use it. Which I was ok with. And if you don't care about it, you definitely still have the fallback of just hitting everything with an axe and you'll be fine.

Haven't tried MP, but I imagine the entire experience just gets better.

Overall, I'd give a 7/10 with the possibility of becoming 9/10 in future.",1707535066,1707535066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I unlocked all available achievements and completed all of the primary quests and a bunch of the side quests. I have played so many games of this genre and by far this game has the best base building tools I have ever seen. You are free to create basically any type of building you want and as you progress you increase the overall space to build in. That being said you could build a small village if you really wanted to. The progression system is also very well done as you explore and find new materials they unlock new items to craft and brick styles to craft base pieces with. Wandering around the world you will also discover log books and scrolls that will direct you new locations on the map and fill in tidbits of side stories of previous people who inhabited the area. Enshrouded is not a typical survival game as it does not force you to eat, drink, or sleep to survive. This game does however give you really nice bonuses for doing so. I would say Enshrouded is more of a open world action RPG with base building mechanics. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys that type of game. I can't comment on the multiplayer side of this as I stated before I played completely solo. I will say though if the game does not have any type of level scaling for enemies in multiplayer I feel like towards the middle to the end it may not be much of a challenge once you level up to cap and have all skill points unlocked.",1707531685,1707531685,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

You die constantly, get stuck in menus while getting one shot.

You need cloth that you can only get from exploring enemy bases killing enemies to even get the supplies to heal.

Its like they went for realism forgetting that they had to make it fun.

2 Hours after purchase we couldn't join each others game for 40 minutes. Weapons break entirely way too fast.


It has been a struggle to continue playing this game. So many times Ive walked away from my desk and came back to quickly get frustrated at menu or game designs and have to take a break.
6 Hours in and I honestly regret the purchase but I am past the 2 hour mark. A lot of mechanics need completely overhauled with huge QOL updates.

Game is Good and Beautiful, Mechanics and Gathering and Combat are frustrating and don't feel satisfying.
Boss battle had zero impact, some dude ran up and grabbed everything, don't even know what we did.
Was cool when someone else would find a chest take everything and you get nothing or when someone beats a quest and you weren't even there.

 I am sure the issues are 50% me regardless I feel a study of what the gang and I would complain about may assist in future development.",1707519042,1707527196,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The fight is also quite simple and repetitive: while you can pick several classes fighting doesn't really have different mechanics except close/long range attacks.
Graphics are really good, but frequent popping up texture will really break immersion and this is very very annoying.
The game supports multiplayer but it doesn't offer in-game chat, so if you join someone which is not your friend you have no way to communicate with other players. Bummer.

If you are looking for a fun game that you can hop into and start playing and enjoying, this is not it. You will need some coffee, silence, and no distractions, if you want to play this game then put fun/enjoyment last.
The amount of frustration and disappointment is incredible. The early game sucks. Maybe it gets better later, but after just a few hours of gameplay it's just not any fun. Your half blind most of the time, at night your basically blind, you have some sort of deficiency with your eyesight so when you exit a dark area the light will keep you blinded until an enemy kills you, limited inventory but you need to carry 8745 items in your hand if you want to build anything. Chop down a tree or break a rock, cool now walk around and pickup each individual piece, no holding a button to pick things up or picking up by being close, nope find it blended in while your half blind from the sun, or cant see cause its dark, then press E over and over again.  
Uninstalling for now, I'll try again after a few months if they put some patches and fixes in.

Kept hearing that I was wrong, so I gave it another go. This game hurts my eyes to play. I tried multiple combinations to attempt to fix the visuals to no avail. The visuals in this game are complete trash. They must be paying the streamers pretty well to play through the eye strain. Made a few screenshots as well so folks can see what I'm talking about.

... Fine fine, I'll write more than this.

The game is pretty decent, it runs smoothly and there's tonnes to explore.
It gets a little dull after 80 or so hours, but for the cost of the game, that is an amazing bargain!
Admittedly, I went through the game killing everything, then spent the next 40-50 hours or so building a village. Because the combat... is the side game, in my opinion.
This game has decent combat, but the best gear in it is gained through chests. Not through crafting. It's RNG. If you know where to look, the entire game is easy because you don't need to craft to get the best gear, you can just go out and get it. Which is disappointing.

But the base building... that is the main game for me. This game has BEAUTIFUL base building. You can build a lovely house, then realise that you can extend the borders of your base to a massive range (160x160x160, which won't mean much here, but if you play the game and see how much space you have at the start, you'll be amazed at what it can become.)
If there was a toggle for first person mode, the building would be so much better. But as it is, the game is heavily carried by how well everything fits together. Just look up what other people have done with their bases, you can see some beautiful works!
(I recommend looking up ItsBitz, he has a lovely british voice, chill music and fantastic base building!)

Biggest issues the game has:

Building rooves is a nightmare. 

There are birds in the desert that never shut up, think cliff racers(Morrowind) with megaphones.

There's an action button for everything, looting, using your execution in combat, talking to NPCs, picking things up is to hold it. This is a problem, because when you're trying to execute an enemy, you're very likely to just loot the enemy next to it... then get hit, because you're stuck in the loot screen... 

No pause button for single player (I dislike dying because the postal courier is at the door, I dislike having to choose between wetting myself, or dying. If it's single player, add a pause button. Just do that. Do it now.)

Character creator is a bit bland, can't alter eyecolour or faces or anything, you just have some presets and you can choose different hair and hair colours for them. And not many hair colours either.

You cannot turn off bloom yet, so you are blinded every time you look at something bright. 

There's a weird fog that appears in your house, not sure how to get rid of that.

The best gear is gained from looting chests and monsters, not from crafting. Despite the games heavy focus on crafting. This feels a bit counter intuitive, why bother crafting when you can just go loot some chests and get better stuff than you'd ever get from crafting. You cannot craft the best gear either. 

There's no arachnophobia mode. Now, I know some people will find this funny, but I am afraid of spiders. Terrified of them. The actual spider monsters in this game aren't actually very scary, they look like they're made of wood... But every now and then when you break a vase or barrel, thousands of little spiders crawl around the area... they do not do anything, they are just there... Icky! An option to disable these would be nice. If I could choose not to be afraid of spiders, I'd choose that... but I don't have that option. however the developer could add an option to hide the spiders. (Or turn them into cat pictures or something)

The birds in... no wait, I said that one. I think we're at the end of this review.
Despite the negatives, this game is early access done right. Most early access games are terrible. They barely run, they have no content, they just do a bad job. But this game has given us a lot to play with and that alone makes it worth buying. Not just for what is currently in the game, but because of the promise of what's to come in the future. The game is worth buying now and it's only going to get better.

If you buy it, I hope you enjoy it. If you don't buy it, then at least go watch ItsBitz on youtube, he's a funny lovely guy who just wants you to be happy.

the game-play loop if fun. The crafting system has a solid start. Item stack sizes could use work as the max stack of items is all over the place and really inconsistent. one flower/herb stacks to 50 and the next only to 20. It make no sense.... if one mat stacks to 50 or 100 then all the mats of that same type should stack to the same max IMO. 

All of the complaints that there is no water in the game really just play blind and have zero reading comprehension... there are lots of lore books scattered around the region that mention the water being corrupted and running through places and destroying stuff. All the red deadly shroud areas used to be water and have since been corrupted by the shroud.... learn to read ppl.

You wouldn't really realize that it's an early access game for many hours in. Enshrouded dabbles in a number of genres and I do not think that it is defined most by any one in particular, but there is a lot of combat with some emphasis on leveling up and exploring. The world is not procedurally generated just FYI - it is a hand made open world (and I think of high quality). While there are minor role-play, story, survival and puzzle elements these are not the game's focus. You'll spend much of your time exploring, fighting monsters and bringing loot back to your base.

Enshrouded feels like someone played Breath of the Wild, but wanted the game to be more like Valheim. I see online many players comparing the combat to Dark Souls and Elden Ring, but for better or worse the combat is nowhere near as hardcore as Dark Souls (it is much eaiser).

edit: At about 30-40 hours in and this is one of my favourite games. This is early access? Apart from a few crashes, this is way beyond many complete titles. I haven't really even gotten into building, just exploring and adventuring. A few frustrating things here and there sure, but this is a truly epic game!

Few more hours in - this is an excellent game so far! Lots of great exploration (other than the main issue mentioned below), great open world exploring and rpg stuff. Build system is looking more and more intriguing.

Only just started, but so far it's very fun and very well done. Combat seems like it will be fun. Building I think works pretty good from the bit i've done. Atmosphere is great! I'm very eager to get back to it!",1706115421,1707519362,True,5,0,0.53125,0,True,False,True

One of the hardest things I find when playing these and hosting for friends is making sure to not progress while others are not online.  Not everyone is in the mood to play at the same time, but thanks to the building system I can sit there for literal hours just building.   I honestly can't say enough about it without a super long winded review, so I suggest watching something online that will show you. 

Cons: There are quite a few buggy things and balance issues with classes at current, but the devs do seem to be actively working on fixes for this.  I've done a few game breaking things, not with that in mind, but just trying to utilize all the cool things the game has to offer.  Example: Growing too many plants WILL crash the games of other players if their machine is not up to par.  So sadly my dream of making a corn maze went up in smoke, at least in multiplayer xD  

There is a lot of future potential in the game and in its current form its still hours of fun and creativity.  Looking forward to what they add in the future.

[2/2/24]UPDATED EDIT: MY own personal crashing bug was fixed by lowering the quality to the lowest, then raising stuff up a little at a time and switching to windowed mode. Seems like for me at least, full screen causes a lot of issues due to UR5 sh*t optimization. 

Enshrouded is definitely early access, and it's a real f*ckin rough some ways. It reminds me of Valheim+Fable+Minecraft. 

I keep finding myself comparing it to Valheim while playing, it went like ""this is really fun, i wish the Valheim world was this detailed and fun, damn i wish this building and crafting was as intuitive and simple as Valheim!!""

What I find the most satisifying, is that with enough pick-axes, you can do ANYTHING AND GO ANYWHERE, like Minecraft-style. 

Also, unliked Valheim, you can full on create an enclosed cave, or tunnel up the side of a cliff to get to the top instead of going around or whatever(Minecraft again!). 

If you have the stamina, materials, and patience, you could probably dig out a huge cavern base if you wanted to.

This game is in VERY early shape, and it got absolutely blasted in popularity by Palworld, so there's not near as many people in the community. I'm having a pretty specific problem with crashing that like 5 other people have, and I had to dig to find THAT one stupid thread. 

If you do any basic search, you'll see that there's a TON of people crashing, there's like some stupid 11th and 12th gen Intel CPU bug from the Unreal engine that makes the game unstable, there's a Vulkan problem, there's SO MANY issues and I don't see as much support on ANY of them as I would expect.

Asking for support on Steam is useless, and trying to ask questions on their discord has gotten me zero responses so far. I tried pretty hard 3 times to get into the game, but at this point it's just not ready and I'm going to refund it and check it out in a year or two. 

I'd love to see this succeed because it looks pretty cool, and I hear good things from my other friends, but for now, steer clear, it's too early, let it bake a year or two.",1706584739,1707510680,False,5,3,0.496643334627151489,0,True,False,True

-Facing the same enemies over and over.
-Getting the same type of weapon over and over.
-The neutral world feels empty and lacking of different types of enemies and neutral creatures.
-Recycling of bosses in different Areas is a big no no. Every Area should have its own boss or at least a mini boss.
-The Temple traps and puzzles are very bad and its kinda pointless to even have them.
Hand held weapons all have the same animation feels lame and gets stale quickly.
-A Legendary (orange weapon) is just as good if not weaker then a common (grey weapon) Only difference is you can upgrade the Legendary weapons which cost a lot of coins btw.
-I Hate that the game restricts me as a player from going into a certain area of red shroud despite afterwards when it does allow me to go there, there being nothing of value or anything special as to why it even restricted me in the first place to go there.

Pros:
-The Building feels super nice so far and is for me the best part of the game
-Bosses feels amazing when you encounter them for the first time and they are not recycled. Gets your heart going.
-Exploring can feel good ,but does gets stale as well later on seeing the same type of enshroud buildings and farm houses.
-Map is massiveeeeeeeeeee

I am aware that it is Early Access, but i cant recommend it as it currently is. It needs abit more content and time in the oven to cook.

The feeling of the game could be a bit better. For instance when I play Valheim, I feel the game in my guts. I dont have that with this game, but that could be because there is no weather, so the world is less alive. Or maybe its the music or the noises, I dont know. Maybe something to look into.

The sense of discovery that you get from simply wandering is phenomenal. Beautiful homesteads, taverns, castles that dot the mountainsides as far as the eye can see. Every corner that you turn, mountainside that you climb, every new path you take, there is always something to discover around each corner.

I've played only in a server with one other person, but servers hold up to 16 players which I imagine would be awesome. At launch we were having some issues with crashing and loading into the game, but right now after the these patches, we have not had ANY problems at all.

Loving this game, loving the mechanics of the shroud. I adore feeling like a flying squirell, activating my glider (which there are multiple variants of) and soaring off into the shroud and the unknown to see what awaits us. It would be nice if we could do things while gliding such as barrel roll or flip forwards or backwards.

NPC's are interactive, they act as their own type of ""Vendor"" where each has a different set of items that will help you along your journeys. They have quests for you to retrieve items for them so that you can craft more advanced gear such as a spindle or a crucible for the smelter.
 Don't want to spoil anything for newcomers and I am not that far into this game myself, most of the hours played came from wandering around and corpse recovery (try your best not to die on a steep hillside by deadly shroud as recovery in the scenario is very difficult and annoying. 

ONE THING: Please buff ranged skills in a way that we can recover arrows, crafting arrows is tedious and extremely time 
consuming. Especially with the special arrow types... such as explosive. Ugh.

Palworld keeps you engaged in seeking out the new pals the entire time you're playing. Youve got random dungeons spawns on the map that can pop rare pal bosses inside, you've got boss battles that required critical thinking and strategy to defeat in proper selection of your pals.. your pals help with base constructions, farming materials, fighting and more. There's HUNDREDS upon THOUSANDS of unique combinations to build your team how you like. There's teleporting, flying, swimming, running, riding, gliding, and walking for movement.. there's a pretty nice story arc to discover and participate in.. I could go on, but honestly most of the plebians here already made up there minds, and its 2024, so its IMPOSSIBLE to actually change your opinion now without being called a cuck or a simp..

Meanwhile.. Enshrouaded has like 5 fricken weapons, 5-6 enemy types, cookie cutter copy pasted biomes that all look and feel the same, NO content whatsoever aside from ""Go to THIS abandoned empty area and search for chests!"" and ""Go to THAT abandoned empty area and kill a boss."" There's half assed ""gliding"" (for 200meters max before you hit the ground.) teleporting and running. Thats it.

Wildlife we get weird sheep, wolves, boars, the very very VERY occasional bat and those big eared rabbit looking things.. no birds, no bugs, no bears, no horses etc etc. The world is empty and dull to traverse

The grappling hook is 99.99% )#*$ing useless as it only works as a progression blocker and once you're past that.. well.. that was fun... once. Ive used it maybe 3 or 4 times total in my playtime, and it's never been actually *required* to get where I want to go. But hey.. we can make an UPGRADED grappling hook!! ... that does the exact same thing as the regular one.

The ""boss"" battles are uninteresting and quite honestly, boring. ESPECIALLY if you're a ranged type... none of the bosses Ive encountered has even HAD a ranged attack. My wyvern boss spawned with like 20% of its healthbar because it took falling damage when it dropped in and damn near killed itself, causing my group to laugh sadly as I took it out in 3 fireball II casts..

Palworld is just a better game right now. Hence the reason millions and millions are playing that, and almost nobody is playing this. This game has a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG way to go before its even in the same league as Palworld.

Exploring was exciting, you get that spooky Valheim dungeon feel in the shroud and by being time limited in it you get this thrilling sense of urgency to all you do in there. Not a lot of end game content, but early access what can you really expect in that regard. I played as a mage and found it was the only build worth my time. I really liked the burst mage dynamic where you had to precisely time blinks from being hit and with staff spells and a few wand shots before blinking away again. I tried ranger a bit, but arrows are weak until iron and take time to craft whereas mana regenerates endlessly with no effort. Also tanking seemed overwhelming solo beyond two enemies (prob better in a group but who has friends that can dedicate 50 hours to a random survival game?) and in later biomes you aggro like 5-10 enemies fairly regularly.

There are lots of players here who are knocking the game because some  areas are not complete and lack enemy types. That's just the same as Valheim was when it was released, and it's taken an age for them to add updates. And yet it has an overwhelmingly positive rating, despite there not actually being all that much content in the game and it was released almost 3 years ago! - 

At the time of writing, Enshrouded has been out for just a couple of weeks and already has lots of potential. It gives me serious Valheim vibes, but has a fuller world. 

I played Valheim for over 500 hours and presently have just over 60 hours in Enshrouded. Comparing the two, I can say that Enshrouded is more of a complete game at launch than Valheim was a year after release.

Of course there are empty areas - it's an early access game after all, which is far from finished. The whole point of an RPG is to explore and discover!

If you like RPG's then I would highly recommend Enshrouded. The killer fog idea is a unique feature and really makes you think about traversing the map. I like the way that quests open up as you find information during quests. 

As a veteran gamer of over 40 years, I would say don't listen to the whiny little kids who think that games that are released today should be 100% complete. It's an early access game that is made by a small software company, who quite frankly have put many AAA companies to shame. If you want a complete game then don't by early access games - it's as simple as that.

Game is slow and grindy, environment is nice'ish but ugly fog effects ruin the effort . This ugly fog is called the shroud hence the name of the game is Enshrouded , we will be stuck with. Id prefer the game to be ""unshrouded""  (fog is too bright i guess) 

 I thought the voxel technology would be nice but i expected more from it.
Character customization is to limited. Npc's are just glorified static workbenches that blurt out some repetitive commands to carry out the next quest. (companions for solo please) also Why do you need a hammer for everything to be able to open a menu or place a npc or to open the build menu when for the rest it sits around in your inventory which is to small as usual. (i mean summoning hammer/building hammer) 

getting stuck in a death loop can also be kind of annoying, when you die while trying to get back to the last place where you died to retrieve belongings

I'd wait it out with this one.It has some potential  Maybe down the road it gets better .

edit: played some more and slowly starting to get to the point i might recommend it in the near future...

it does feel like the developer put a lot of work in it already considering the game is up for 4 days.
 
edit2: It's a pretty good EA game considering the time it's out, had a gripe with the fugly fog but that has been addressed,   there are lots of quests ,  huge  terrain with terraforming,  character creation is meh but hoping its a placeholder, and its not bad enough to be a dealbreaker imo.

However after this much time it got pretty boring for me, replayability is low at the moment, not many types of enemies and after about 5-6 hours into the game its gonna get pretty repetitive.

Building is great, probably the biggest selling point of this game, so many possibilities (I'm just wishing for more angled variations in the future)

Also the nerf they did was excessive so it's clear they still have no idea how to balance their skills. The real issue is people stacking this aura in multiplayer, and instead of fixing stacking issues with diminishing returns or making it not stack at all, they just drove the skill into the ground. Y'all should apply to a career at Activision, since this is how they like to handle balance in their games, and kill the success of all their games.

While working on it, we envisioned one group of friends experiencing the world together—sharing bases, resources, crafting recipes, and loot. "" So said the developers of Enshrouded. This is why it currently sucks as a single player game. It has bosses and a progression system that insists you defeat those bosses, and if you don't you are blocked by deadly red shroud. Now I've defeated all of them until now, and nearly defeated the latest one, but even Keen themselves say players shouldn't be made to do tasks.""Players shouldn’t feel forced to participate in quests. Our player base is diverse, after all. Not everyone is bound to enjoy our combat or puzzles"". That's the developer saying this, but as a single player you are made to complete tasks and fight bosses. You can't play stealthy as they say in their promo video. You are locked in with a boss and that's it. Now if you're playing with friends I'm sure most of the game is hunky-dory. As Keen say you can choose what you want to do and your friends can do the same.

To conclude I will say at the moment Keen are telling you this game wasn't designed with the single player in mind. If you want to buy it you can still have a good time, but for me it was ruined by the game being designed for co-op, and also having no save option.

The art style if fantastic and I have seen so many beautiful scenery with the lighting and colors.  The game does a fantastic job at immersing you into the world.  The building in this game is very good allowing you to make very complex looking structures easily.

Combat is decent but could use some improvements as far as different types of attacks.  I am purely referring to melee as that is all I have played so far.

Elaboration: After unlocking the blacksmith I expected to have lots of new recipes to craft from weapon-wise but unfortunately he was only able to craft me 1 starter-type sword and 2 sets of armor. Not sure if I needed to do something else to improve his crafting options but after 17 hours of play and placing a forge, unlocking other allies, completing dungeons, etc, nothing has changed on that front. I'm still stuck with the same scrappy sword he made me when I first unlocked him during the tutorial phase. Even lamer is that this sword cannot be upgraded, so unless you are lucky enough to find a good sword in a chest somewhere, you are stuck with the scrappy one or just use a different weapon type altogether. It would be nice if after completing a quest you would unlock new recipes or maybe even find them as you're exploring in chests or something. Or maybe the NPC's could have a list of recipes you can see but can't use yet with clear pre-requisites on what you need to do to unlock them. But playing in the dark endlessly without knowing how to unlock better recipes while relying on RNG to find a decent sword that isn't rusty or scrappy is not my idea of a rewarding progression system.",1707488224,1707488351,False,0,2,0,0,True,False,True

-----
Make it [b] personal [/b]:

Give character actual purpose and not just minimal explanation for existing. Such purpose is only to achieve by making permanent visible change to the game world.

Give the character not only the power to change the world but also the freedom to choose how. Even a flameborn might not want to live up to expectations.

Give the player reason to act. Just cause the quest says so isn't enough. The character might be fine with saving the world. But the player might have more fun with taking shiny stuff from unagreeable neighbors and displaying said stuff in his castle alongside the neighbors heads.

-----
Make it [b] unique [/b]:

Avoid unremarkable places and quests.

A historian NPC might act as a quest giver for more unique loot in believable places. He also might provide backstory without those out of place letters.

There should be some kind of challenge involved. Repeatedly flying to the quest marker and kicking open a gold chest on the roof gets old very fast.

It belongs in a museum: Item display options at base are necessary.

Avoid generic enemies and places.

Give the opposition names and personality. They also should have goals of their own. That way you can easily come up with quests to help, hinder or beat them to it.

Make the opposition react to the characters progress. You already have a skill to appease the Vukah. Faction interaction changes like this should be related to a quest.

-----
Make it [b] consistent [/b]:

Avoid lack of consequence.

Using shroud tainted potions, items and powers should affect the character (and his base). Make NPC's and Factions (Vukah, Marauders, Shroud) react to that change.

Change interaction options with factions based upon quest choices. E.g. subdue enemy faction; make allies; ""shroud control"".

Avoid amusement park feeling. The world building should be believable.

Why the spire trap dungeons? It feels like a pure game mechanic choice. We want a jump'n'run trap challenge – there it is. But form follows function. The teleporters are there to reach the flame atop the spire. If the traps where to protect the flame, they should be concealed and easily avoidable by a legitimate ""flame-caretaker"" with the proper knowledge. Or maybe the trap dungeon could actually be some mysterious steampunk machine of the elders laid bare by the degradation of the spire and not intended to be traps at all.

Why the nonsensical chest placement (""Warum liegt hier Stroh?"")? Again the game mechanic should not be that naked. It's kinda indecent.

I like to sneak up on a place to see whats going on before deciding what to do. It would be great if I could witness a group of marauders going about their business and interacting with each other. Maybe listen in on some conversation. Unfortunately right now all there is to see is the marauders walking around uninspired, weapons out waiting to be farmed for the scrap metal they happen to make their underwear out of.

Avoid the letter spam.

Why is paper the most resilient material in the world? Entire Cities crumble and wither around a mere piece of paper staying perfectly readable. Unharmed by age and weather. Why is everyone literate and in the habit of keeping a diary? You shoud emplore other means to convey the fate of the world to the player.",1707485945,1707485945,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It starts of so great (apart from awful performance), and then becomes worse and worse and worse. To the point where it’s probably one of the worst game I have ever played.

Everything is mind-numbingly grindy. It’s like every decision has been made to make it as time-consuming and boring as humanly possible. From the number of resources needed to do anything, to the QoL things like running back and forth to get the stuff you need, the lack of shot cuts to transfer item etc etc. Farming it was so painstakingly cumbersome that I just gave up on it. Its like the entire vision of the game is based on “what’s the most boring and tedious mechanics out there, lets beat that”

And then we got the map. They are very proud that the map is hand crafted, they really shouldn’t have, it is garbage. On the map of the map, you can not in anyway shape or form make out what is what, no roads are mapped, death and blocked zones are vaguely or not mapped at all. So when you try to explore it is constantly “Ill go there, run 30 min, no blocked, go back 30 min, try again, no blocked again – again and again and again and again……” Ohhh yeah and they like putting invisible-no-escape-death-zones everywhere just to add to the grind. 

Finally, we have the visibility and lighting, not only does it ruin the fun of the game constantly dropping into invisible-no-escape-death-zones, the shifts between picth black and the brightness everytime you go through a door will give you actual headache. It constantly goes from can not see anything to someone pressing the physical sun into your eyeballs. 

The conclusion, what an absolute piece of garbage

Enshrouded shows us that while being a pretty safe title and without necessarily inventing anything new, you can get a fun and smooth experience if you polish and improve on what are core aspects of the genre.
Game in its current  state after 10 days of EA release is already enjoyable for dozens of hours.

The handcrafted world feels a lot more enjoyable to explore  compared to procedural counterparts.

The building system is solid so making decent size buildings isn't perceived as a chore.

Loot and enemy variation could use work, there's very little excitement about finding new loot or even looting stronger enemies doesn't feel particularly rewarding.

Combat is pretty basic but I don't necessarily think it needs more depth, could be fun to have more options for the skilltree to explore different styles of gameplay but I think different enemy variety or weapon types could be plenty to imrpove the experience. Encounter difficulty is trivial unless you get ganked by 10 enemies in a small space.

Crafting is alright, looking forward for more materials and items to be crafted. 

There could be more to say about it but I'll leave the rest for you to explore!

First off, the world is massive.  It is fun once you get up in levels and have a decent means of getting around but at first, it's tedious.  Real tedious. 

There isn't much of a story.  It's just books and quests.  No real meaningful dialog or story at this moment. 

Combat is clunky and boring.  Block or dodge.  Slash.  Or, pepper your enemy with wand missiles from a glitchy place until he or she is no longer an issue.

The enemy all look the same for the most part.  Blue dead things that don't really have any difference from each other excepting armor, sheild or sword.  There's some bowman and two floaty things.

Overall, it's an okay game.  But, at forty hours, there's literally nothing else for me to do.  Sure, I can build some stuff and make a big city but, for what?  

I would wait until there is some polishing and a lot more content.

Let that preface the entirety of the game for you.  This is a 3rd person Adventure RPG.  Like Zelda, or, you know ..... not survival games.  There is 0 penalty for anything in this game.  This is a 100% reward and 0 loss game.  

There is food.  Its a buff, nothing more.  You can turn food into worse food.  Its great.
There is water, you don't need it, plants do.  See how that's different?  Shaking it up!
Weather?  None.  0.
The time does change, but, you know, like anyone else, i skip night time.  
Cold in the mountains and hot in the desert?  Nope, you would think that's how it should be, but, we are doing things different so people are like ""huh, wow, i wasn't expecting that, so stunning and brave"". 
Bases provide nothing more than a buff that boosts stamina.  Stamina that you use a ton of to do any action.
The voxel world is all surface level.  Once you get past a couple layers, its all stone baby, all stone.  
The world is less than populated.  
The enemies are all the same (im guessing maybe 10 total different types in the entirety?)
Its a ""my shits broken"" sim.  You will spend more time running back to repair your stuff than actually fighting stuff.
Want to get ore?  Have fun spending hours on 1 node because every 5 swings you get 1 ore.  Tin?  Its junk, but, you need like 20 to make 1 bar.  Whats that equate to?  Like 2 hours of swinging a pick and repairing it ... oh and waiting for that sweet stam to regen.  Have a ton of stam?  No, you don't. 
Crafting is a joke and 100% pointless.  Craft arrows by the millions you rangers/hunters.  Everyone else, spend days on end crafting bandaids.  You will need them.
Classes?  Not really.  2 choices:  Ranged or melee.  Both are good.  Magic user?  OP.  Healer?  JK!  Beastmaster?  Yeah, what the F is that for?  lulz.

I can go on and on, i wont.  The entire game is a feature.  There is no core to this game at all.  The story is AI generated.  The world feels dead and the voxel aspect is laughable at best.  I dont want to hear about ""ohhh, you big mad, its early access"".  Sorry, I dont make excuses for companies.  They released it in the current state, it gets a review on what it is not what i think maybe someday it could maybe be.

Multiplayer?  Not really.  Its like playing WOW, but, without a group or guild.  

I feel like no one in the company had any real direction and everyone was working from home and wasnt talking about what they were working on.  Imagine if your boss was like ""hey you 20 people, draw me a house, but, you can only draw your one section.  No discussing anything about style or anything, just draw"".  That, thats the game. 

Is it fun?  Sure, flying around killing stuff.  Its not terrible.  I got my time from it.  Is it replayable?  (ie: make a second class and play).  No 100 times.  Its a one-trick pony.",1706769492,1707465209,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Until that gets fixed, the game gets a thumbs down. This seems to be low priority compared to some of the more up voted items like more tabs and the like.

Edit: The building system is train wreck. With a system so simple one would think that simplicity would work flawlessly. Not the case. The leveling tool, the rake, does not level, that is to say if the ground is mostly level already it will do an outstanding job. Anything past a large pebble and major landscaping is needed and it does not look good.

Limited tools, limited shapes, chunky, non aligning positions when in close proximity to any camera angle and forget attaching something with any degree of precision. The building system is on par with 1990's tech. Valheim was limited even with it's far superior selection and tools but makes Enshrouded build tools and choices, mechanics laughable.

The delete key still has not been moved or allow a lock. It appears some quests in the finished zones were not completed and render some areas useless in shroud cleared areas. Planting has problems in that some plants continue to regrow after being harvested and when one crop matures, there are two there. In some cases remnants of past plantings in ones, two's or three's pop up randomly.

The 31 blocks used for walls and various limited shapes for building houses look more like walls that would surround a town like a fence as many have ""extra"" things on one facing based on compass direction, that is, no matter how a wall or piece is flipped, the clear side or side with bones on the ground will always face the same direction. Having bones on my floor or some other visual is not something I want inside my house.

House build pieces also leave gaping holes in the ground. Housing pieces in many cases cost way too much in the form of resources. Many of the pieces in the thumbnails look good but when built look average at best, only 6 blocks of material look good in my opinion detail wise. This is with ultra everything and machine that is capable of far more than Enshrouded can put out.

Armor does not look like it does much for protection and armor stats do not appear to work. Take the Radiant Paladins helmet. It states a flat 15 to critical hit chance, with the character stripped of everything, the helmet stats do not show up. There is a lot to list in regards to armor and what it does and does not do.

I have ""finished"" the game and my current attempt at building is becoming painful to the point it is not enjoyable. Enshroud needs to get building to at least the level of Valheim, and Valheim had a low bar, average at best.",1706936212,1707464221,False,1,0,0.484472990036010742,0,True,False,True

With building being my primary joy in survival games this building system is far better than most. Very flexible although no triangle pieces and I don't see the ability to angle walls if that thing interests you but you can create almost anything out of what you have to work with.  Doesn't lack in place-able items either.  Many different skills available to enhance game play and the different weapons and armor is a lot of fun to mix and match.  I love the concept of the NPC's being the crafting stations (with some key workstations to enhance the experience) rather than just crafting stations, very different than most games I have played thus far.  It would be a nice touch if the crafters had working animations instead of just standing around but def not a complaint in any way.  My biggest gripe as a builder is that there is no way to cheat in the materials, this requires you to seriously grind.  While I don't mind this during normal game play, it's a pain when you are just trying to build for fun and see what the system can do.  Not helpful when playing solo as not all of us have people to grind for materials for us.  The 30 minute reset on POI's and challenges is great for groups as all can experience them however when solo it's rough to have to keep fighting my way through areas I have been to when moving onto new POI's but definitely do able.  Great game though, definitely worth the money.  I bought the game for my sister and her family as well and so far we are all enjoying it.

Initially, I liked the fact that you can customize buildings in more detail than a game like Valheim but then I noticed objects like doors don't look great if you're trying to get creative with your layouts. Building is an awkward, ugly process, and there can be a lot of weird artifacts when you place two different materials next to each other. The flat roof texture and look is just... terrible.

The character animation is awkward and jumping looks and feels weird. Combat is clunky, unimpressive, and repetitive. The squirrel suit and grappling hook don't really add anything new.

The NPC I summoned into my base is very lifeless. They just stand there and behave like another piece of equipment used to get upgrades.

The core game mechanic, the shroud, is just a nuisance when you're trying to explore and progress through the game. It's annoying having to run back to the edge of an area to fill an arbitrary meter so you can go back in again.

Exploring the ruins was my favorite part of the game. I liked the secret rooms. I also liked mining. It's feels nice to dig into an ore vein. Although, (and I'm not 100% sure on this) it did seem like the mine I was working on filled itself back up which I didn't like.

I regret my purchase and I wish I would have requested a refund when I had the ability. I'm sure this game has a long way to go but I don't see myself enjoying it in the future.",1707457875,1707457875,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you like survival games, RPG lites, crafting, building, exploring, lore, adventure, etc. This game has most of that polished. Had this game came out before Valheim I am sure V would be taking a back seat now. This is not a direct clone or port of V, but it does share similarities. A lot of what V got wrong to start...and still does imo, this game fixed. Buildables - check. Many, many, MANY more design choices/options/colors/types.  Combat - check. Lore - Check (This one I can take some heat on...I love the Norse mythology...BUT...its been so over done there really is not a lot to learn that is 'new' - These folks made everything up, aka, new AND engaging for Enshrouded.) Graphics - Yup, pretty as can be. Stability - 1 client crash in 80+ hrs of game time...pretty darn stable. FLYING!!!....well, gliding really, but its dang cool and a very fun way to get around! and Music - Score is varied and pleasant. 

Now, the one GIANT, GLARING, problem it has, again, IMO, is that MP servers are set to whomever is the furthest in the quest lines and everyone has has, or gets, auto completed up to that point...NOT the smartest choice here. Valheim gotcha beat on this one. There is no way I am going to get a server and 2, 3 or 4 of my buddies together to play Enshrouded, only to SHAFT them all because I am at the end of the game so they won't get to experience any thing. Also, this game cannot be beat in one gaming session with your gaming 'crew' so starting with fresh characters to experience the game together that way is a no go. Should they ever decide to change how questing/progress is handled for MP then this game will begin to far outshine any and all competition.

I will carefully recommend it now with the caveat that [i]it's not finished[/i] and still needs some polishing, but you can easily get some fun out of it. If you come in with the expectation of hardcore indie survival sandbox game with ark PvP gameplay, this game isn't for you. It's an action RPG with voxels and the possibility for co-op sessions that should ideally be done together.

[h2]Graphics [/h2]
Enshrouded is an incredibly pretty game. 
I've never seen voxels pulled off as well as Enshrouded has. My GTX 1080 is at 100% constantly and SCREAMS at me to release it from its miserable existence, but I refuse to compromise on the graphics to the point I can't enjoy them anymore. So be it, I'll play at 10-40 FPS average.

The way the voxels are handled in conjunction with how the building system gives you a lot of freedom in building, makes this one of the few games where I bothered to build a house and flesh it out. Being out in the world just screams [i]polish[/i] to me as well. Marvelous ancient structures with intricate details to them, some dungeons have amazing level design into them. Seeing little towns or outposts with half decaying buildings and rubble everywhere, they're very pretty to look at and give a lot of eye candy.

I hope they keep polishing this world.

When I built my house, I started incorporating a more open design with the roofs. I could have closed everything off at the top and be done with it, but instead I opted to layer the roof multiple times with openings everywhere. I did this because I immediately noticed how well the lighting system interacted with it, with the sun slowly rising and casting rays and light shadows inside. I think the devs are aware of how powerful this is, because I've seen structures in the world everywhere exploit the same phenomena of light invading the inside of structures through holes everywhere.

I bet you, if I had a better graphics card with ray tracing, I could've even seen global illumination start to play its part into this by scattering those light sources inside the houses as well. I hope in the future, when I return to this game, I'll have had my computer upgraded by then to fully enjoy the graphics at 60 FPS at least.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
Enshrouded has good and bad gameplay elements, and this is the part where it sometimes falls very flat. I think they still need to work on this a lot.

[h3]Combat[/h3]
I want to get this beast out of the way first because honestly, 2 hours in, my thoughts were already going to ""boy this combat could use some polish"". Don't get me wrong, what you do get is smooth for the most part, your attacks feel responsive, but combat is just very limited. The balance is pretty terrible as well, it wasn't until level 10 or so, 20 hours in, that I finally started to face some difficulty, because before then I 2shot every enemy while they provided very little threat to me killing them. It was boring. 

Eventually I did stumble upon the difficulty where parrying started being a viable option, and this was mostly due to enemies being enough of a HP sponge that they could attack before I killed them. Parrying was a pain sometimes, but it is what it is.

[h3]Variety[/h3]
The game has 1 handed swords and axes, they are almost identical in function. The game also has 2 handed weapons that, as far as I know, are all the same in that category: they're just slower versions with slightly more damage where blocking/parrying is shut off from you. You also have wands as a spammy ranged option but they felt weak to me, I kept one around in case melee wasn't viable, but it was definitely not the weapon of preference. You also have two ranged weapons as side arm options, and they feel slightly more fleshed out, but more could be done there. Magic staves need to be heavily invested into to become good, and then it becomes really strong to use in terms of damage at the cost of needing resources to invest into it.

I can't be arsed detailing what could be done to improve it, read other reviews or something. Get more weapon variety.

[h3]Enemy variety, AI, complexity[/h3]:
Yeah I dunno how to feel about this, most enemies are just a variation of walk-towards-you-and-attack. Enemies in crowds tend to me not that much more dangerous due to how often they don't attack, and I feel like they intentionally limit attacking because some other enemy is already attacking. The only novel enemies I can think of were some of the boss fights, the weird mushroom fellas I can just ignore, and the greenpoisony scavengers that are such a huge jump in difficulty from any other enemy I've since learned to single them out and focus them down. More could be done here, enemies in certain places could be more dangerous.

[h3]Crafting[/h3]
Functional, interesting options, eventually felt a bit forced to rush the obvious progression beats in this because I needed quality of life and upgrades. It's not a game with a focus on intricate crafting mechanics and resource management. It could be if it so desires to, but it serves its purpose.

[h2]Other elements[/h2]
Where combat and RPG falls short and fails to be engaging, Enshrouded pulls off setting, exploration and lore pretty well.

[h3]Exploration[/h3]
The game sends you to a variety of locations via quests to get you to unlock stuff. A new building block here, a crafting upgrade there, a weapon, sometimes a bit of lore. This is pretty decently done. I've encountered a few unique dungeons that felt very cool to explore through as mentioned above by the voxels. The level design in these areas was pretty superb in this as well.

The game offered some type of environment puzzling and platforming but unfortunately never really becomes too deep, intricate or complex to really entertain me, since most of the puzzling and platforming is straightforward. In the case of platforming: [i]lmao I got double jump let me just skip everything and get everywhere[/i]

The tower dungeons were mildly entertaining gauntlets but nothing complex or difficult enough where I consider it remarkable.

[h3]Lore[/h3]
I can't say too much about this without spoiling it. I enjoyed reading most of the notes lying, I enjoyed the way the lore tied in with [i]other elements[/i] in the game (this one is pretty novel in ways!). I think it needs slightly more ""plot hook"" to hook me into solving this grand mystery of why the world is the way it is, and what my goal could be in this world is now. This definitely needs polish, and is definitely beholden to the game just being worked on and fleshed out. I am excited in the future to see what they do with it, and I hope they flesh this out in a way that [i]other elements[/i] become more of a plot point in this somehow.

[h3]Fast travel[/h3]
Ah it's hard to say, on one hand I enjoy the quality of life and I needed to run back to base often to dump my resources (that eventually started overflowing), and the element of fast travelling to a tower and gliding halfway where you need to go is very enjoyable. I did eventually start placing flames in other places to reduce travel time quite a bit.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
[b]Improve your combat, seriously devs, that's your weakest point by far.[/b]
Then maybe look into fleshing out base building if you want that to be a focus, otherwise you can keep it functional as is, since this is definitely something that can fall to feature creep.

Your world and level design is excellent, and I want to compliment whoever worked on it. It's very pretty and I really enjoyed roaming around in it. What you might want to work on is the uniqueness of it and the puzzles within them. I know that's a pretty big ask considering how big you want the world to be. But since it's your strongest point already, I think you should definitely keep pushing and polishing that quality.",1707447088,1707447135,True,1,1,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,True

I'll keep this as short as I can but cover my thoughts. First the building mechanics are crazy good to me, the pieces will meld together and allow for some crazy awesome building. It can be frustrating at first for someone like myself with an OCD for things but once you get the hang of it it can be amazing. The combat could use some more tweaking, its good but its pretty straight forward hack and slash with some dodging if ya wanna spice it up. The game world is surprisingly well thought out to me as almost everything can be tore down or mined into for resources. Which brings me to crafting, for me it is nice as it isn't too overwhelming but also not underwhelming. You need to craft sub components to be able to craft the slightly more complex ones like armor and weapons. The only thing I wish for in the future is some weather and for it to have an effect on player stats in some form to provide motivation for base building. In the end I will admit I was skeptical at first but now I can't wait to see where this game goes and do hope it has a bright future.

If Valheim, Terraria and Conan had a child it would be the blessed child called Enshrouded. And it makes me giggly that it's in early access and yet it is so much fun to play and probably has a very bright future. You get alot of game for your buck.
It is an online Co-op game, but i've played solo for pretty much the majority of the game, with some instances that a friend comes in from time to time. What's cool is that you can play solo, then open up your world online so others can join and you can join other worlds with that same character. So how ever you prefer to play, it is a total blast alone or with friends. A bummer is that quests are server based, meaning one player could do all the quests and you miss out. You can go back and get the rewards for youself though, as most of the loot and enemies respawn.

It's your typical survival game with progression in farming better and better materials for better gear and other components, and at the same time it is a great adventure game with lots to explore and quests to do. I'm a guy that doesn't really like to build in these types of games, i.e i am the guy that goes and collect all the materials rather than being creative with building, but even i think Enshroudeds build system are great and easy to use.
Throughout the game you collect characters, one of them for example The Blacksmith, which helps you craft better gear, and as you collect more you suddenly have the urge to build yourself an entire villiage with all the people that help you out. Or if you want, build an entire castle or tower. Imagination is the limit.
The glider item is so cool, it isn't just gliding from a cliff to the ground, in the endgame you can soar large distances across the map.

It's in early access so, of course there are some buggy situations here and there, sometimes when i fly into something with the glider i can get totally stuck. Or there are floating objects here and there. But i think it will get patched in the near future.

Enshrouded is great and hopefully it will become even greater and i look so much forward to see where it all leads.
 This game gets a 8/10 from me.

There are some pretty impressive single player abilities.  Like after you build your base and set everything up, you can create a new character, and they are in the same world, and can use any items you have in your base or storage.

Cooking, crafting, fighting, dungeon exploring (love that the dungeon isn't something to portal into...you literally are following a cliff when you run across a cave, and boom, traps, puzzles, hidden treasures, nice drops and rare items to farm inside), tombs raider style swinging with your grappling gun, and so much more.  Nice growth system, not instant and worth the levels.  Fights are realistic.

The world is huge.  Not big, not large....huge.  And kudos on the transitions in topography.  Gradual transitions to new biomes make it very lifelike.

Down sides:

You won't want to start as a caster. Spells cost materials you won't easily get early on.  Later in game, you learn abilities, but you will have to earn those.  Save the mage for the second character, when you have the ability to stockpile materials to cast those spells.

I have found myself looking at the clock and wondering how 4 hour passed.  There is so much to do, and there is no point rushing it.  The game is forgiving, so dying is only a pain in having to run back to where you were.

Enshrouded was a bit of a hidden gem for me, I didn’t know too much about it until it was basically upon us and I was pleasantly surprised. Whilst the game has its issues it’s important to remember that it is EA so I’m sure there will be a lot of improvements based on the player feedback. 

From the start of the game character creation was quite bland for me, was hoping for a bit more customisation, though this is really just a minor thing and hopefully will be improved on. The base building aspects took a moment to get use to but after awhile I enjoyed it a lot, and as someone who likes building it’s been fun exploring this aspect. 

Farming materials seems to be a major aspect but not overwhelming unless you’re playing a ranger type and need to create arrows. The amount you have to farm just to make arrows especially at the higher tiers for the investment in skill points is just not worth it. The classes are quite unbalanced and underwhelming unless you’re playing a mage type with wands or staffs, but every time I tried to play something that wasn’t a mage I ended up drifting back to mage. 

The gear needs expanding whilst it’s easy to farm the higher level stuff when you’re at the end of EA, there only appears to be common armour, and no higher tiers except for the odd pair of boots near an early obelisk. 

As development progresses, I’m sure balances will come into play but I would imagine priorities would be elsewhere. At the time of this, I haven’t seen any development roadmaps from the devs and this would go a long way with understanding what is to come, but for what the game is currently it has definitely been a lot of fun and would recommend to anyone who enjoys this genre of game.",1707435682,1707435682,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I can heartily say I'm happy I took the plunge - this is a fabulous game.  Is it better than Valheim, or Palworld, or LEGO Fortnite, or any other survival game?  Well yes and no.  It's different, but takes cues from several of them, and add Zelda Breath of the Wild in there too.  It's approachable, but challenging, not hardcore, but not easy.  Tons of secrets to discover.  Bugs are minor, and for an Early Release title, it is in very good shape.  I adore Valheim and really liked Palworld for a couple weeks, but I have been playing Enshrouded exclusively since just after it was released, and I'm having an absolute blast with it.  Exploration is strong, questing is fun, combat is fun, survival elements are manageable and not draining or annoying.  I haven't even gotten fully into building yet because I've been focused on unlocking as many building materials as I can, but what I have done so far is probably the best base building system in a game that I've seen yet.

Well... probably one of the best early access games I have even played on. 
The team did a really fantastic job ! 
It is rich, meaningful, eye-catching, and well-coded!

Pros :
- Very nice
- Big but not empty, and it is something really important when you compare it to other similar games
- The crafting system is great and rich.
- The life time of the game is long.
- It is fun to play alone but also with friends
- The armors are really nice and so are some weapons 
- I liked that you get the quest by reading papers, letters, and diaries and that the NPC's give you quests too !

Cons :
- All the classes or not really balanced; it is really difficult to play physical build, but if you play ranger or wizard, it is something else!
- Talking about wizards... It seems really fun, but probably way too powerfull
- And for the ranger, we don't have enough bows and It is a nightmare to farm the twigs... The arrows are very fastly used (even when you stack 500 of them) but you don't have a lot of way to farm twigs... It could have been great to transform wood or plank wood into twigs or something similar 
- The talents could be a little bit more developed and have more sense (for example, the ranger build is mainly focused on explosives arrows but you get them in tne end of the game and they cost a lot of ressources to be crafted... And it could be great to have actives and not only passives ! 
- Maybe not enough dungeons (but it is an early access, so it's ok...)
- Something that was a little bit frustrating was the boss's loot... Sometimes you kick in a random chest and find an insage legendary weapon, and sometimes you kill a deadly boss and get garbage...

Overall, the game is a go-to if you like survival and explorating game !
I am sure that the game will continue to be awesome and get better and better with the future patchs

I give it a solid 9/10 !

As a garden designer IRL, I really love that we can manipulate terrain and there's a fairly extensive plant list to utilise, plus pairing that with all the different building blocks, you can make some magical places!  I'd love it if in the future there's a skill tree set added for being a farmer - where you could get more for your harvest or more resources for higher level soil used, but so far it's great (not too basic for farming).

I think what would make this game next level, would be if enemies attacked bases occasionally...kinda like 7 Days to Die...and if the NPCs could move around the room and use furniture.

The game seems torn on who its target audience is and what it wants to be. It's much closer to a casual hack n slash/exploration/building game than a survival game. 

It's okay. It could have and should have been a lot better. Fundamental game design choices are limiting the potential of the game. It's extremely easy. The game play loop includes an ""explore this biome and gather random things from it"" feature but the amount of things to gather increases arbitrarily, leading to a huge time sink of clicking plants and rocks the further into the game you go. (40 iron ore, why?!) Did you want the game to be casual or a grind?

The enemies are stupid. They run at you and repeat the same 1-3 attacks. The combat is very unsatisfying, unless you are a very casual gamer who loves being overpowered. And yet they have movement based tools like double jump, updraft, blinking. They have parrying and skills to specialize into roles. It has a guise of skilled combat but it's so easy it's a hack n slash, no matter what you put your points into. 

The skill tree is pretty underwhelming in my opinion as well. There simply aren't enough skill points to make it interesting, and locking stat gains behind boring and useless skills was a questionable choice. Like why do I need to sink 20 some skill points into the healer tree just to get the +int/2 flame level skill? How is magic damage synonymous with healing? Shouldn't it be spirit for a bigger mana pool and more sustained healing? But there wasn't any thought put into the skill tree, really. And that is evident by the fact that all the initial 1 stat gains leading into each ""branch"" are just listed rather than placed where they would have the most impact for a specific build type. So why are skill points so limited?  

The building menu is nice. It takes a second to get used to but it has a plethora of options to enable the avid builders. My only complaint there is there 30 different types of stone, rough stone, weathered stone, weathered rough stone, worn stone, weathered worn stone... you get it. Too many similar options, that are frankly too expensive to make for most people to devote real time to it. Another fundamentally questionable design. There are no structural rules for building, so is it casual or not? Either go all the way. No rules building with cheap materials to give builders the chance to really enjoy building instead of whacking multiple resource types to make 1 building material, or implement structural rules for a more realistic and immersive experience. And why limit altar placements in certain locations, such as the city with the wyvern? I can place one just outside the city for a teleport but can't retake the city, build one inside city limits and rebuild? ""...survive the terror of a corrupting fog, and reclaim the lost beauty of your kingdom."" 
So, that was a lie. 

Movement is clunky. It really needs some work. There are way too many ""platformer"" spots, like the towers, that can just be bypassed by double jumping and gliding through the traps and obstacles. Not that the traps do enough damage to warrant any kind of caution at all. Mindlessly sprinting through the traps is a fairly safe bet. Falling is the only real danger in this game. Falling into mushy lava is generally a guaranteed death, as your enshrouded timer runs out within seconds. Even barely touching mushy lava results in death via timeout. In 40 hours I every single death except for one has been from falling/timeouts. It really feels bad when your greatest enemies in the game are the camera and Piranha Bytes-esque movements. 

Final cons and complaints:
flame level tied to base instead of player. 
set world instead of randomly generated.
Needs serious optimizing and display options. 
Needs a lot of balancing and number tweaking.
World is reset outside of altar zones every log in. Carving a staircase into the landscape outside of a base for ease of access later will just be reset. 
Not enough variety in equipment, so continuous exploring for more feels unrewarding. Same reward over and over again. 
Pretty awful attack animations on melee 2h weapons. 

Pros:
Looks good [strike]when things actually render in correctly, and between random drops to 30 fps.[/strike] fixed. Devs are working to improve, so that's a plus.
Exploration feels really rewarding at first. It's what kept me in the game beyond the refund point, and can be fun when there are high places to jump off of.
A lot of content for EA, and only 1 crash so far

I think the difficulty settings will make or break the final release version. Tip, allow players to set the shroud time limit for their play style. i.e. I hate the shroud, but love the game. I would enjoy the game with a 7 to 10 timer on the shroud, but that's me, others will want it to be 3 minutes....................don't forget to add a warning noise to the count down timer. 

Okay, as frustrating as some of the mechanics in the game (Early Access) are I got to say this is quite fun, and frustrating, but I can't stop LOL.

* Graphics good enough 7/10
* Not a fan of the rush rush shroud areas, but I knew that was going to be a pain.  1/10
* Some of the shrouded areas are to dark to really see anything. 0/10
* Gathering is pretty good. Just need to add a TAKE ALL button for stone, and logs 7/10
* Combat needs a lot of fine tuning, it's to easy to swap a weapon, sit down or jump in the 
   middle of the fight, get killed, respawn and run all the way back........................... 4/10
* Except for the roof that just would never place correctly, I used floor tiles to complete the 
   roof.  Building in general 8/10
* I like the idea of 2 hot key rows, but I hate when you hit the alt key which switches from hot 
  bar 1 to hot bar 2, it needs to have an option to either hold or toggle the key instead of 
   just toggle. I tried to kill an enemy with my blue berries many times.

Overall if I had to compare this to Valhiem which is the closest game, I would give Valhiem a 4/10 and Enshrouded a 7/10. 

So hopefully the devs are listening and fix the EA issues, and bring us so new content. The only bad thing is it is an Early Access game and I am not sure if I will be motivated to start all over if they do a character/world swipe. So keep us early players in mind!

They also managed to make me play this game a shit ton without forcing countless hours of grind and mindless auto-generated (slow to traverse) maps down my throat. You can build a LOT of stuff without grinding as much as Valheim (god, the resource grind in Valheim is exhausting. Probably like 80% of my time spent in the game), you can explore a vibrant, fleshed out map that isn't just random crap stitched together poorly by the (often) creativity killer that is ""Procedural generation"" (the equivalent of AI made content, often lazy, soulless, greedy and repetitive), the environment is FUN to dig into (or blow up), instead of being a chore like in Valheim (you want to dig in Valheim? well you'll get a mob-AI defeating trench and nothing else!). It manages all of this while looking WAY better and with more fun and engaging combat.

This is what Valheim should have been by now. But too little too late.

Enshrouded is great, and it ONLY JUST released into EA. Even if they have as slow a development pace as Valheim (please god no, no, god no), then it would still be better than valheim haha... Though they didn't make NEARLY as much money as those other lazy devs did (even though Enshrouded released in a better and more polished state than valheim), so it would be much more understandable. They also aren't going around banning people left and right for talking about problems with the game and the like.

If you are hesitating between Valheim and this game, then DO NOT hesitate for 1 second longer, play this game instead and forget about Valheim (unless you are desperate for a viking theme game, then sure... But be warned, the resource grind is a fucking slog in valheim).



Original review:

Great Survival-crafting game, has a lot of potential yet is already very good for an EA title. 
Mix of multiple games and, as many have said already, it pulls a few mechanics from valheim but gives the world much more life, with NPCs, quests and interesting lore.

When you replace your walls with other material walls an old part that merges with different kind of walls remains at the edge of the wall. So you need to take down all the walls that have this bug instead of just only the walls you are replacing with other material walls.

I bought this game and did not regret it. I have been playing non-stop for a few days now and I really needed a game like this. While 7 Days has a ton more to build, the enemies in that game are boring and buggy.

This has a lot of different areas and enemies. I love having a skill tree to level and exploring is daring yet not completely punishing. You're getting more points than an entire branch of skills can fill so you can make hybrids to your liking!

-There is no grouping, no chat, all is shared and can be stolen or broken. Play with friends or people you can trust after a wile. I'm lucky to have find 2 or 3 random cool people.

We are at Flame level 4 now and more and more recipes, gear etc is opening up!
Sure  hope we get more kind of walls/roofs etc. It is very basic atm

The game is amazing, is really enjoyable, one of the best games I have played in the last year, but this is such a let down. Keen games you are letting people down, instead of fixing so many glitches why don´t you fix a real problems that prevents gamers to play your game at all?

Conan Exiles: 1,735 / Valheim: 509 / & Days to Die: 994 / Grounded 452 / The Forest: 290 and the list goes on.

I already have 178 hours on record for this game. Here are my current thoughts:

This game throws you into a handcrafted world that can be fully destroyed or built upon with this game's engine. The environment is beautiful and filled with things to explore and hidden treasures that reward exploration. Unlike many other open world base building games, there is fairly interesting lore that can be learned through gathering notes and other things throughout your play-through. Should you miss any of these notes the journal in the game will help you find the plot lines for each story so you can keep track and will also allow you to read the lore later on should you desire to.

BASE BUILDING is my favorite thing to do in any game. This game has more potential with it's building system than any other game I have ever seen. It's already absolutely astounding and, if they continue to expand upon it, it will absolutely be the best system I have ever played with.

QUESTING AND EXPLORATION is entertaining. It even rewards those of us who enjoy building because your quest reward can be discovering new material types to build with. The weapons and armor designs are well designed and feel like they fit the world they are in and is always fun to find a new model of equipment and ""oooh aaaaah"" at it for bit.

SOUND DESIGN is well utilized in the game. Whenever you enter the shrouded areas the ambiance changes in the way that makes you feel as though you are being constantly watched and pushed in on from all angles. You can hear noises in the distance of things you might think ""I don't want to know what made that sound."" It's well done. 

COMBAT is fun but there is lacking development there. Much like when Conan Exiles released the combat isn't ready. --Melee: Currently the melee attacks are just the same three attacks and does get stale quickly. There is a parry system for melee that can be rewarding as well as special attacks you can unlock in the skill trees. (The devs may want to look at how Conan Exiles reworked their combat and do something similar in nature)
--Magic: Magic is currently extremely over-tuned. At the start of the game you will be made of glass and hit decently hard but by the end of the game you will be an undying god with a nuke in your pocket. It requires reworking.
--Archery: Archery is VERY satisfying. Landing head shots and doing flips over your enemy to shoot them in the back of the head is fun. However, the material farming required to make arrows right now is by no means fun to upkeep. Also, there is an entire branch in the skill tree for just exploding arrows and good luck crafting those. They are ludicrously expensive and you might as well just play a mage that explodes things for free.

WORLD DESIGN is great. It's expansive (currently in early access there is only about a third of the full map released and it is still large.) You can tell serious thought was put into designing the POIs and through lore notes you'll learn why places are the way that they are. Main complaint I have is I have noticed a few POIs that share enemy placement and POI structuring. 

There are some real cons to the game though and I have to be unbiased in this.

Again, the combat needs a lot more added for melee and the skill trees need to be reworked. The roles are not balanced. Story and quest progression is SERVER based. So if you join a fully completed server on a brand new character you will unlock every quest and skip all the prerequisites for unlocking them. On the opposite side though, if you join a new server with your fully fleshed-out character you'll be back to square one (though insanely powerful for where you are in the story on that server). The AI only knows one thing and it's RAW AGGRESSION. They will chase you even if it means jumping off of a cliff.  The optimization for this game still needs a lot of work. It must be a massive undertaking to make an engine like this and have it function properly at this scale so I can't blame them for having hiccups though it needs to be addressed. Aside from that I've had no crashes or serious issue outside of some bad frame rate and visual bugs.

Conclusion:
This game has nearly limitless potential in this genre. As long as the devs keep up on it, it can grow to be a beast of a game. The team making Enshrouded has been communicating with the community a lot and has been allowing them to make suggestions and vote on those suggestions to see what the community wants to have implemented or changed. I feel it has a long way to go to meet it's potential but from what I have experienced of the game so far that potential is limitless. 

You may wonder why you've not heard much about this game. Well....
[This game would have had far more traffic if it hadn't been for the release of a certain other game that is basically just 20 games ripped off into one horrid, unimaginative, corporate amalgamation of copyright property tiptoeing and released immediately on XBOX game pass. Then it was picked up by every content creator and streamer trying to get as many views as possible before they all lose interest when it inevitably becomes the micro-transaction hellhole it was designed to become. ]

Character creation is a bit limited. You can select from a handful of presets and change hair, hair color, and things like that. After rolling my first character, I decided I didn’t like their look in game and made a new character. I got to a loading screen and listened to the backstory, and waited. And waited. And waited. I walked away for a couple of minutes, and it was still loading when I got back. I had to force close it, restarted the game, and tried to continue, but once again I was met with an infinite loading screen. 

I deleted that character and save and started over again, and this time the game booted right up. It was getting late in the evening by this point, so after running around the starting area for a little while I decided to call it a night.  When I went to play again the next day, I was once again met with Loading…

Anybody that watched some kind of trailer or gameplay can understand that it is a survival, building sim with great emphasis on building and less so in lore.
You can explore a huge percent of the currently provided map without the need of leveling up too much which as far as I am concerned is great when it comes to the freedom that the game provides to the player.
Moreover, the amount of content and places to explore for the game being an Early Access title is way too much that can satisfy even the most ""seasoned"" survival game enjoyer. 

I am trying to say as many things as possible so that I do not give everything away so anyone who is on the fence of spending the money to get the game can experience it themselves!

[b][i][u]*** IF ***[/u]  THIS TITLE HAD THE SAME SHARED CLOUD WORLD SAVES like Grounded...[/i][/b]
It could be a runner for GotY.  It however does NOT...so I am 51% Thumbs up here.

***************************************
*** Recommended with major conditions ***
***************************************
TL;DR - This is a Valhiem clone that does somethings better and multiplayer worse.

Still TL;DR - To be clear this is really a Single Player game that other friends can join.

(fyi:  The 'undo build' action you can use after digging to revert voxels is fantastic)

The multi-player aspects are really not great.  It's more like The Forest than Grounded.
And for a multiplayer 'server' set up that is almost fatal for a title like this at this point.

[b][i](note: Developers.  If you are going to implement cloud saves and multiplayer worlds...
Copy ""Grounded"" or why bother [/i][/b].

It's a good single player game.  This is not a building or co-op experience for the most part and that is disappointing.
A lot of the game mechanics are clearly hopeful for group play.  They 'class' system is interesting if you want to call it that.

But again...very much ""The Forest"" type of game play the way the multiplayer servers are.

There is however an almost fatal flaw at this point and it is group play.  
It simply does not work if you think 2-16 people are going to invest time and energy in a solo save game that none of them actually share...this game will burn out before the season is over.

What I specifically mean is this.  You host a server that is 'the world' ... anyone who joins is stuck in a odd position of only able to do the remaining server quests on that specific server (you will not have access to everything you can do either though you do bring things with you like in Valheim) ~BUT~ at the same time you are equally stuck in only doing their quests *if* possible.

There is also no in game chat (which has been covered)...that I can forgive at this point everyone uses some other communication method...*BUT* this IS a multiplayer game...[b]people need to chat even if it's emotes which for the record are a waste of time 99% of always because no one really cares...EXCEPT when you literally have no other form of communication other than 3rd party[/b].
...to be clear...I do not want emotes...but PCs use a keyboard...let us type!

And finally...seems they have too much content and not enough detail.  
I get it's EA.  However when less that 1/3 of people play longer than a dozen hours and your multiplayer aspects are so severely restricted...

It's a good game and fun...wait for it though in case you missed it.  
I really don't think it's going to make it long term.  And that's a hard sell.",1707138904,1707413762,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

There are some really awesome concepts and if they nurture and improve, I'll change my review to positive. Right now though, it feels outdated in certain systems. Fall damage is a joke- if you fall 5 feet, welp that's instant death. Looting anything awkwardly requires you to press two different buttons for some reason? Like press ""E"" then hold ""F""; just bad UX in my opinion. How about just hold ""E""? Why make the player press a completely different button on something we have to press constantly? Building is complex but also unnecessarily convoluted. You have to have a ""construction hammer"" to build anything, and then you have to create ""material blocks"" just to build... How about remove the dumb hammer and just let us straight up build what we want straight from a menu? It's so outdated, it's like they saw Valheim and were like ""Let's make it MORE complex!... because... REASONS!"". Lots of little quality of life changes need to be made before I will play it again. After playing Palworld, this game feels like a huge step back. I can't even climb anything? Ugh.

First, I want to state I played closed alpha and I am still playing the early Access release. 

In this review, I will be addressing four different topics. The world, combat, base building gameplay and suggestions 

The World

This has certainly seen a ton of growth and polish since it's closed beta state. The world is beautiful and the lore would tell you this world is dead and empty. That just isn't the case. While standard humans seem to be gone from the world the remains of there towns, homesteads, forts, and cities can still be seen all over. The remains of these places are beautifully crafted leaving plenty of places to explore even beyond my 60 current hours in game I'm still exploring. For an unfinished crafted map that says a lot. The enemies in the world populate many of these ruined towns or there own encampments. Making it dangerous to explore the ruins. But on occasion you can stumble into towns that are empty but still have a presence you can feel the despair going through these abandoned buildings reading the notes left behind next the corpses of there writers. The world Keen has crafted is one that encourages you to explore and delivers.

The Combat

As this is Early Access, the company is not in it's final state and there are certainly balance issues that can crop up. 

I have the most experience with the magic system as that is my current build. I found the magic system enjoyable and challenging. It requires a lot of dodge and switching between a wand and staff. The wand applies quick damage with no ammo cost at medium to short range while the staff give access to the more powerful magic at medium to long range. Spells require spell charges you craft or find in the world. There are items called eternal spells that in exchange for longer charge times have infinite uses and high damage. You are very squishy as a magic user, but have the option to use various potions, food items or find or craft gear to apply buffs to your character. In addition the skills tree can grant additional abilities (i will not be covering the skill tree in this review). There is definitely challenges with melee and arrow users. Currently, I am a little sad with the variety of spells variety. I am at the current end game and I've found 9 spells currently. I am hopeful that they will increase the variety of spells per element type and in total in the future. but as of this moment it can grow stale after a while. The charge times on spells make it seem like magic was more intended for group use while playing with friends. but is still usable as a surprise tactic and even in regular combat though much more difficult. The only suggestions i would have to make the magic system more friendly not easier would be eliminate the need to be animation locked (there is a work around ATM, that will likely be patched at some point) as it seems silly to lose freedom of movement with a wand. I would even be okay with a damage debuff to incentivise staff incorpation. The last suggestion would be as previously stated more options for spells and more spells per element.

Base Building

In enshrouded you are tasked with building flame shrines (base flag). These altars are very centric to player progression. These shrines have 2 different level types one that increasea the buildable area you have and the second allows access to new areas of the map not available to you initially.

There are 3 important advantages to base development. Rest bonus, Crafting stations, and Farming.

Rest bonus

The rest bonus grants increased stamina, and stamina Regen this Is very important to progression. You can fight, mine, glide, lumber, and run longer. This rest bonus is attached to the comfort level of your base. You can increase this through building a structure and filling it with furnishings.

Crafting stations

Throughout the world you will find various slumbering craftsmen. These crafts men help with a variety of items from being able to craft armour, weapons and ammoto base upgrade items, potions and spell charges. They also have various upgrade items that are found through quests or exploration and crafting. These are the crafting stations finding them and placing them in your base unlocks more craftable items. Though not all it's item may be craftable until you located the necessary material to unlock that recipe.

Farming 

I have a love hate relationship with farming. On one hand it's very satisfying. On the other hand there are mechanics that make it more time consuming that it needs to be.

To get started farm you need a well and access to the farmer. You'll craft a station that makes seedlings using the plant desired and additional materials depending on the recipes requirements. You'll use the farmer to make farmland or it can be mined In different places throughout the world. Here is my issues with farming 
1. There are two tools in the game used for farming 

The hammer under terrain is used to place the farmland.

The rake only use is to level land.

2. Placing g and gathering seeds one by one. I can not tell you how many times I've had to click to place down one crop at a time only to turn around in 15-30 minutes to do the same clicking to pick up the crops. I'm really hopeing an item or something comes in later allowing for multi-placing and gathering of crops planted.

That aside farming is a extremely useful, but not necessarily if you wanted you could spend an insane amount of time collecting resources you absolutely can.


Overall, I think this game is in a fantastic state for growth and evolution and its added bonus that it is fun to play units current state

Some of the typical ""gaijin otaku samurai"" from the neighborhood are saying the game is easy ... or it's this or that... creating these massive expectations as if this title was being marketed as the next GOD OF WAR meets ARK meets fucking ELDER SCROLLS and so on...
 It's just a fkn building game... with spells... like Valheim (but upgraded, in my opinion) ... Nothing less... nothing more. Plus, it's still early fkn access...

Building is decent and the lore, although very cookie cutter, it's good. The ""immersion"" is done really well if you read the notes left behind by those who died. Some people seeking shelter from the shroud within the last sparks accross the world... It's pretty sad.... specially the lovers' one.

So yeah, to me, all-in-all... It's a solid building game with basic RPG elements trailing a good path. If the devs play their cards right and actually continue pouring love into the game, like DRG, and others, then this game certainly has a lot of potential.",1707406887,1707406887,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

+ a technological marvel. Voxels are a difficult foundation to 'get right' and Enshrouded has a mini-voxel world with good performance, attractive to the eye, and enjoyable to explore.

But ... most of the effort has gone into that foundation.

- the world is basically like an MMO; mobs spawn in certain locations and wait for you to come to them

- there's no threat in the world perse. you can build, build big, and never worry about storms, starvation, hostiles, world bosses coming to you etc. And this lack of threat is a big part of the game being very passive.

Threats only exist when you go out to find them, but then the game is extremely gentle: death doesn't really mean anything, fast travelling everywhere - including home - is more convenient as a free uber ride on demand.

You go out to unlock resources you need only for short durations/periods of the game, a boss head you need once, a recipe to complete a quest, and then you turn the page and repeat that in a different part of the world. Fast travel here, beat the spawns, collect xyz, fast travel home. Repeat.

 Without threat and consequence, the world feels like a lovely tapestry to play on and run about the 3d art to get a visual treat ... while never quite being pulled *IN* on a deeper level.

It feels like Conan Exiles, but EA, so without depth of content.

The skill tree is also flawed and I suspect will get some balancing corrections.

AI .. doesn't really exist. It's year 2000 WoW levels of ""spawn here and do nothing unless aggroed, then run at the aggroer""

In all it is not a bad game, it is just a thin game with shallow content. Good for builders who just want to build, but if you are looking for a survival game where every x-time the mobs come to you and wreck your base, or the Shroud covers everything like THE FOG and mobs spawn in a world attack ...... this is not it.

This is a passive game where base building doesn't matter, so you do it just because you can. 

I suspect in a year, in two years, the game will have more meat to the bones ... more purpose ... but it's EA, so ...

Also in Valheim you're fighting for your survival, while in Enshrouded you just jump into the unknown and if you die, its pretty easy to get to your grave again.

Building system is also pretty different and I have explored the one in Enshrouded much yet.

The game is in Early Access, just like every similar game at their first release, to me this type of release looks more as a scam than a feature, so the outcome of my review is based on the content and fun I received based on the price of the game, not based on future promises.

So the background of the game is…. Ok, so something happened :-D I wish I could tell more but friends were shouting in discord to skip the intro and let's start the game. Shame on me, I have not started a second character yet. One thing is clear, something cataclysmic happened, which wiped out civilization and every human being. Some, including you, survived in sealed chambers. While my friends also kept playing until the end, after a dozen hours all of us continued in single player. Why? I’ll explain that, so let’s check with the problems of the game first:

[h1]Disliked[/h1]

The issue which forced us to play alone, while irregularly joining to the servers of friends to help them against bigger enemies are the quests. Most of the time it was finished only for one of us, while it stayed in the quest log of the other players, just like all the marks on the map for the players who suffered by the bug of the unfinished quest.
I disliked the low variety of enemies. You will find the same enemies in the shroud at level 1 and at areas where the enemies are level 30. Do you like to beat wolves at lvl 1 area? Fine! But I guess you are not curious about them after 20 hours at level 11 areas. A creative mind was clearly missing on the project.
While I liked the build aspect of the game, it might have happened because I have not played many similar games. Even not, when friends keep telling me i should play Valheim, but hey, Valheim don’t have achievements, i don’t play such games 😃 Still, I have a certain feeling of lack, expected more building variety, round object, pillars, and so on. Probably more will come during Early Access, but i said, i review the game based on current feelings.
Some minor bugs, like enemies stuck in the ground, nothing serious 😃

[h1]Liked[/h1]

I liked the shroud mechanics. You go in the “fog”, and you have only a few minutes to explore before it consumes you. Some talents or increasing the strength of your flame altar increases this time, but the risk always touches your nerve system while you get lost in the shroud and trying to find a way out as you run out of your last seconds.
Gliding. It is just awesome. Not sure I mentioned it before, but gliding is AWESOME. Did i? I think not, so: gliding is awesome.
Huge world, there are a lot of areas to explore, different biomes.
Building aspect: while it was in the negatives, because of the lack of round pillars, objects and because I could expect a bit more variety of items, it is important to notice that you can build walls, pillars, etc, from millions of different materials. This is the only aspect of the game where the variety already reaches what is expected in a fully released game.
Not experienced a single crash and was not falling through the floor 😃 Nowadays it is important to mention these ☹️
Btw, Gliding is fantastic 😁

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Enshrouded is not a bad game, there are room for improvements, sure, but I already enjoyed it in current version, was totally worth the 30€(-10%? Release discount, i don’t remember how much it was), and usually i am very hesitating when i need to spend that much on a game, I am usually waiting for deep discounts. If 

[h1]Hey, I am an achievement hunter![/h1]

[b]How to perfect?:[/b] Just play the game. It is long, yes, but eventually you should get everything as achievements really for fully exploring the map, all flame altars (you might get the location marker unlocked by found scrolls, but you still need to go there, marking actually visited flame altars with custom markers is recommended), cutting out all shroud trees, levelling up to max, etc. Nothing really hard or challenging, but as the world is huge, it will take some time. Don’t need to be afraid if none of your friends are playing this game, there are no MP achievements at all.
[b]Perfection Difficulty:[/b] 3/10. As I said already, completion is not difficult, it just takes time, but some bosses/areas might be good, if you have a friend who is also playing the game and can assist you.

Bow/Arrow is just outright overpowered.

Building is a fun activity but since there is no survival aspect demanding you to build stuff to protect your base or farm food, it's more or less just that. A fun activity.

Exploring is very fun even more so if you play coop (who would ve guessed). You're done exploring the map in like 20-25 hours, if you play coop it's like 10 hours because you can revive. If all your mates play bow/arrow it's done in under 10h because pve becomes so easy it's silly.

Progression feels like a lot of very involved steps to gain small increases to your progress. Oftentimes you'll have a complicated retrieval quest in a dangerous area to be able to make a single, small thing, or certain conveniences come very late. For instance, the kettle for the farmer is acquired in a level 15 area, which gives you access to basic foods, including the ability to passively cook meat. Copper meanwhile is a chore to acquire when going from the scrappy pick to the copper pick, yet after that point, unless you're building copper armor, there's not a lot of use for it after that point.

Combat doesn't feel too great; there's a lot of neat passives and modifiers, yet strikes and parrying feel inconsistent or unresponsive. There are no i-frames in your dodge roll, which may take some time to unlearn from other games. However, even considering that, it feels very awkward when you have a blink dodge, and yet you somehow still are hurt when you're an untouchable ball of light. There's low enemy variety and little reason to seek out tougher challenges for any reason other than questing, as the drops are identical.

The building system is phenomenal and is the highlight of the game, allowing for granular adjustments to structures.

The inventory management is incredibly poor; stacks feel too small with how many resources and drops the game will give you and how many you need. There's no labeling system yet to keep your goods sorted, and transferring things from one box to another is a pain, Even looting enemies (or your corpse) requires interacting to bring up a dialog, and then confirming to take the drops, which is a very slow and cumbersome process.

Control wise there's also a lot of duplicate inputs: your grappling hook is the interact key, which results in a frequent case of ""I want to loot this body, yet now I'm ziplining up this tower, that was behind me and not even within my field of view."" Gliding and double jump are also the same input, eliminating the ability to do more precise platforming via delayed double jumps.

Overall, the game feels like a lot of very long plateaus in progression, that go a small step up each time you finish an objective. It's a cool concept but it feels clunky in execution, and the typical gameplay loop doesn't feel super gratifying or rewarding.",1707373609,1707388088,False,4,0,0.505237162113189697,0,True,False,True

Great engine, combat and mobility.

However, what keeps this game from being very good and far from great is the overall lack of content. There are very, very few enemy types. Not nearly enough interesting boss encounters. A lot of the map is pointless and unused. A lot of temples and dungeon areas are empty. The quest types are very basic and dull.

There are also balance issues, Wands are overpowered. The magic is boring and basic. You spam the same wand attack and single spell for most of the game and really no enemy types are challenging for anyone with a decent wand from early game to late game.

No PvP, your base never gets attacked by monsters/NPCs so really no point in the building block tiers. The crafting is fun but adds nothing that a hundred other survival games haven’t already done.

I think this game will be solidly good (in the 7.8-8.3 range) after another few years of development, today it’s just a fun little 50-75 hour game.

Obviously with early access some features may come in the future and bugs be ironed out, and then obviously some things are just my personal opinion so I will try and distinguish between the two. 

I personally don't really like the main mechanic: the shroud time. Having areas have a timer that simply counts down until you die just isn't really much fun. It just means that you never really feel like you have time to actually explore in the shroud. It's always making you feel rushed. Also I just don't like a timer count down to simply dying. Increasing debuffs would be one thing. When you combine that with how annoying the terrain can be to traverse and the random pits they have all around the game can get quickly annoying. I'm not sure why the terrain has to be so cumbersome but it is. They use a mechanic called the deadly shroud to keep players from accessing areas they are underleveled for, but then they fill these pits with them around the regular shroud. It's an enormous nuisance to instant die because you fell into a pit of deadly shroud that you can't jump out of. Plus the lighting for the game is beyond weird. Everything in the regular daylight outside of the shroud feels washed out with excess white haze. Then nighttime is brutally dark requiring torch use, but there's plenty of holes to fall in accidentally. Imo the filters of the game are unpleasant and I have to adjust my monitor to make it feel less crappy to my eyes. 

Some things that might be early access and ironed out, or maybe my opinion, or both. So many things feel clunky. The game can't always seem to process multiple inputs resulting in things like missed health potions, or block animations but then damage being taken regardless. The combat is pretty basic, even with unlocking skills to make it more fun like roll, jump attack, double jump etc. I very rarely have a combat moment where I do something cool and feel like a badass. There's been lots written on this but mainly blocking/parrying feels awkward and often fails to work as it seems it should. Stacking attacks means that the extra click input sits there queued up even after the situation you're reacting to has changes, but then your character inputs it anyways even though you'd much rather now do something different. The order of priorities of input are off and the ability to react to what you are actually seeing isn't there. Sadly the combat is also pretty simple (which would be OK if it was simple done very well). There's no heavy attack light attack options, and enemies interrupt your attach chains which makes using 2 handed weapons feel just terrible. For more on the combat, this thread is spot on: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1203620/discussions/0/4142816719795964714/

I don't like the way loot is acquired. It also feels clunky (just the best word to describe the experience, really). Farming is annoying because really, it's just chest running to get something good from a pretty large loot pool. It's not like games where you're farming for a stat roll on an item. It presents a really unpredictable way of gearing up and if you're not overly lucky, an annoying grind where you have to quit to main menu and load again to try and farm an item. The loot is definitely a bit sparse (yes this part is early access and likely to be fixed) but even early access I expected a clearer route to armour and weapons. Looting chests in this game has to be one of the most underwhelming looting experiences I've ever had. And for the most part, the designs kinda look goofy (my opinion). 

There are other annoying quirks that hopefully will be fixed. Using item from inventory automatically closes inventory. Very annoying if you want to eat 3 types of food. Interacting with objects is not reliable with where you are aiming and can be finicky, especially vertically stacked chests. There is not quick stack to nearby chests feature which is perhaps one of my biggest annoyances because there's no way this wasn't suggested by people in their beta testing. It's completely disrespectful of your players time to force them to either organise chests or build an bunch of them because someone wants to play dump and go. And this feature is in games that are years old *cough* terraria *cough*. 

TLDR if you want to listen to a nice soundtrack and ambient sounds while building in a pretty good building system, while resource grinding to be able to do that. This game will probably offer you more than me. But you won't look cool doing it and don't expect to be thrilled by the combat.

Pros
- Decent Graphics
- Simple, fun combat and mobility.
- I'm gay
- Base building is surprisingly good. You can place blocks halfway inside of each other to add more detail and depth to your base and they snap together flawlessly.
- Beautiful world to explore, quest and gather NPCs to add life to your base!

Cons
- The game is locked to 60hz as of writing this review (only reason I don't have 100+ hours in this game already)
- Couldn't buy a server through G-Portal because they were full so we had to go to a third party to get servers which were more expensive.

Cons (to date, as of early access)
Not a great variety in enemies or wildlife currently.

Dismantling old books really triggers my RSI. You have to press and hold for just about every book on a shelf you find. This gets to be a lot for my hand to handle.

[h3] Overall [/h3]
As a single player game I can recommend this game, but not at its price. The trailer is imo glorifies the game and it's missing so many quality of life attributes. Server side loot I can handle, server side quests are broken so multiplayer is a no go. I'd recommend looking at the Enshrouded feedback page as a base point of whether you would find this game enjoyable in it's current state. 
[url=https://enshrouded.featureupvote.com/] [/url]

[h3] Summary [/h3]
The [u] concept [/u] of this game is sweet and simple. The lore that is provided in the world makes it feel more whole and interesting. Basically, like a retelling of stories through various people's journals.

The [u] music and sound [/u] in this game, to be honest, doesn't strike me as impressive at all. Writing this review even having played it for a couple of days straight, I can't remember the music all too much. Thus, not bad but not amazing.

The [u] graphics [/u] of this game are not all that impressive either. The game does look alright once you fiddle with some settings, but there's such a lack of settings that really hinder it. Not, being able to remove motion blue is my biggest. As well as the fact that 60fps is as good as my friends and I could get it. This really made the game look janky and quite ugly in some parts.

The [u] game play [/u] is fine. It's what you would expect of an adventure and open world-ish game. The [i] skill tree [/i] has a lot to it making various combat and tactics fun especially with friends. As well as gear that you get such as the grapple and glider. [b] But, [/b] how they were displayed in the trailer is not necessarily what you get imo. To me, it looked like a lot more of free use.
The [u] grapple [/u] is only at certain points. 
The [u] glider [/u], it feels, so lacking. The fact that you can't dive and curve up which makes a lot of flying feel so much fun and smooth in games really makes this glider loose it's appeal. The glider feels heavy, linear and you can't get very far.

Thus, far [u] combat [/u] hasn't really been challenging. Too easy especially since there is a lack of presence of enemies at all.

What I find to be a [u] core aspect [/u] of this game such as gear and looting is severely lacking. Looting chests never feels satisfying because they contain so little. Most of the time, the gear in the chests are worse than my current gear, which i suppose is fine but it's very consistent.
The [u] world [/u] itself is kinda bland. It feels empty. There are buildings and a few biomes. They're not heavily populated with fauna or flora. Too spacious really.

[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]
At first, I didn't like the idea of [u] server loot [/u]. Tbh, I'm a greedy b**** and don't like sharing (only child things). But, I actually didn't mind. As well as that this game isn't multiplayer but co-op. So sharing the loot to suit each persons gear makes it feel more like team building. However, I can't imagine playing this game with more than 3 people. The loot is so slim and lacking. Most times there are only 3 things in them.

The [u] ""harth"" [/u] which acts as the area in which you can have [spoiler] NPC's [/spoiler] and build in the beginning is quite small. If you wanted 2 harths, especially if you had a bigger group of friends I can understand would be very laborious and take a while. I personally, like to build my own area, since it was only 3 people which it barely fit it was fine. But, a bigger group would definitely need some communal living.

[u] The game breaker [/u] (for me and my friends). Server-based quest progression. Absolutely stuffed. I have quests that my friends don't have (and I'm not the host). Quests that can't be completed because only one person opened the chest and looted and it can't be reopened (why can't one person just take all the loot?). You will have to wait for [b] ALL [/b] of your friends to be on because if you do quests without them it will be forever locked thus, they can't level.

For instance, once you get the advanced gliders, grappling hook, and double jump, exploring the word is an absolute blast. The crafting system and building systems are fine, but nothing new or inspired is there to make you want to build anything outside of the NPC crafting extension objects or comfort-related items. This game also has no invasion aspect, so your home bases are never raided by hordes of enemies (which in my opinion is a good thing). Combat is fun, snappy, and engaging, but is too easy.

My biggest gripe with the game is that they need to add more 'secret' stuff to find and unlock, and the main story is a bit uninspired and seems secondary to an otherwise fun game. Also, the map suffers from Ubisoft disease where you're just going around completing the various things on the map. Taking inspiration from a game like Grounded in regards to exploring the map and completing activities would be a good idea for these developers.

Regarding combat, this game needs to be more difficult to offer anyone beyond the 'average' gamer something interesting to overcome. I am an archer and every encounter is the same (even boss encounters): Shoot for 30 seconds, dodge a melee attack or single ranged ability (or don't even dodge it and just regen hp while shooting some more). The archer abilities also encourage you to be close to your enemies otherwise you waste arrows with the arrow volley skill. Health potions are completely overpowered with no cooldown and just allow you to tank hits and keep shooting.

Good game overall, but needs some work to be more actively engaging. Progressing through different zones should feel rewarding, but it just feels like a new list of chores each time.

""It gets better?"" or does it?. Does it matter if the game can't hold me with its seemingly emptiness?. By the time they actually put mobs in the game you will just have decimating skills, right?. Basically by the time there are mobs (or any at all really) you will just have AoE (area of effect) moves that splash all the mobs dead. 

Boring solo. Surely even more boring as co-op making the enemies getting decimated even more decimated. 


I've played many survival builder games, but this is just freaking boring. Nice graphics and building tho. Weird how i need building blocks for crafting anything of its type. Weird how i can't craft with the items in my chests: the base has a zone.",1707363384,1707363495,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. One of the first things it tells you to do is build a shrine out of stone but doesn't give you a pickaxe or anyway to get a pickaxe.  All the tutorials I find online just say to make a pickaxe...I don't have the recipe for one.

2. It said you can cook meat in the fire.  I found some raw meat and sat by the fire, there is no option to cook the meat, no crafting option to cook the meat, I clicked on the meat and then clicked use and It just made me stand up and eat raw meat and take damage.

3. The next time I got near the fire it actually gave me the ability to cook, with no tutorial at all I burned the only other meat that I had and it turned into a burnt wood block somehow.

4. Sleeping does not replenish hp.  I think it should.

5. The rotation option of R + mouse wheel just doesn't work.

6. I stumbled upon a repair anvil that allowed me to repair all of my equipment at once.  That was a VERY nice feature and I wish all survival games had it.

7. A burnt out campfire will give you tar for some reason...?

8. It would be nice if when you scrolled over an item it told you how to get it.  Right now I need metal and I have no idea how to get it.

9. Same issue as #8 just came up again.  I need ""shroud wood""  I went into the shroud and cut a tree down and got normal wood. So again I have no idea how to get that but I need it to progress.

10. I was fighting 3 guys in the shroud and there was a completely random explosion that killed me and them and now I have to go back and get my stuff.

11. Still looking for metal I went all the way down to the quarry and find out it's a salt quarry...Still no metal, still no idea where to find it but I can't progress until I do.

12. the floor is lava

13. I had just replenished my shroud timer and it instantly ran out for absolutely no reason.

14. I have run into at least 4 flint deposits...still no metal...

15. 5 flint deposits...

16. 6 flint deposits...

17. Had to google it, which is ridiculous.  YOU CANNOT MINE METAL...as stupid as that is you have to break stuff or kill mobs to get it...that so freaking stupid.

18.  Animals will just run right off cliffs

19.  The building hammer is unusable without a tutorial.  I can go up and down but I can't go left and right so i can't pick what i need to to build!

(Had to google it AGAIN because it says how to do it, NO WHERE.  You have to use the number keys to select what you want.)

20. It says I have to equip the hammer and build something to complete a quest, I did and the quest still isn't complete so that's fun.

21. The controls need work.  I was being attacked by like 6 things and I tried my best to aim my shield the right direct but it kept spinning me the wrong way allowing the enemies to hit me in the back.

22.  I was just trying to jump up on top of a platform and I got stuck behind a wall and had to mine my way out.

23.  If you think digging a big hole hoping to find a cave or something cool would be fun, then just play something else, because there is nothing to find.

24. Who ever thought it would be a good idea to make the power attack button and the pick up loot button should be the same, is an idiot. AND YOU CANT CHANGE IT. That is just deliberately stupid.

25. Enemy archers can walk on lava without taking damage.

26. There are enemy's you CANNOT kill without a ranged weapon, I almost died in a cave because I didn't bring enough twigs to make arrows...

27. died in a cave because there was literally no way out.. The beginning of the cave was slanted so steep i couldn't run back out and there was nothing but a dead end at the end of the cave.  Great programming there buddies.

28.  I have a blacksmith and 2 different crafting stations and I still can't make arrows better then sharp twigs.

29. Just adding levels to the same monsters is a VERY LAZY way to make your game take longer to beat.

30. I liked the healing bear shamans, I thought that was pretty unique.

31. The drying rack is 100% pointless.

32.  The floor is lava, AGAIN!

33.  I now need clay ill give you a quick summery of the tutorial on how to get clay.  ""...""

34. I made sure to sleep because I don't like going out when its dark and hard to see.  It told me it was morning so I fast travailed and it is still dark and hard to see.  Fun glitch.

35. A poorly laid out dungeon and a puzzle are not the same thing. (Ancient Vault - Farmer) I ran through the entire level and found 1 button.  I need 3 to open the door to the farmer.  I ran trough every available path 3 times, no button, no other area, nothing....giant waist of time.

36. SUPER annoying how it auto puts raw meat into your hot bar.  I have accidentally eaten raw meat 3 times now.

37. Not having a pause button when you are playing single player REALLY sucks and is completely unnecessary.

38. THE FLOOR IS G** D*** F****** LAVA! I am sick of getting forced into an area where I am stuck on this red floor that instantly kills me!  This is the one where this game review switched from a thumbs up to a thumbs down.  This is BS don't give people a glider and call your game ""Open World"" and then if they don't go the exact way the developers want them to go they die to a lava floor.  It's rail roading with extra steps.

39. SOOOOOO many flit deposits.  WTF do you do with flint????

40.  There is a point on the top of a mountain.  I literally ran a giant circle around the entire mountain.  There is no way up.  I am not going to spend the next 7 hrs making stairs so...F*** that point.

41. I have come across unscaleable walls for the last time. I refused to play this game anymore until there is climbing gear.  Clearly you guys wanted to make a game that is just one big rail road and so you made a game with the illusion of open world.  

-you can dig and craft the world - Why? there is nothing to find so there is no point unless you just want to spend hours of your life building a big underground room with no point to it.  Nothing ever attacks your base so there is no point to putting effort in to making one.  
- You have a glider and a grappling hook - That you can only use when and where the developers wanted to you.  If you just want to glide into the mist there is a 50/50 chance you will just end up in lava and die. The grappling hook?  You can only use on specific points they set up for you.
-If you want to just run to a point you got a 90% chance you will just find a hill that is too steep for you to run up so you're just F***ed.  

Dropped the ball as hard as you possibly could.

...except for the grappling hook. That grappling hook has got to be the worst in video gaming history—truly awful thing. The game would be a whole lot better if they just deleted it completely and acted as if it had never existed to begin with. 

Aside from that, I kinda feel bad that this game launched so close to Palworld. Because this one, just like Palworld, is truly a new and refreshing spin on an over-saturated genre.

EDIT 25 HOURS IN: Okay, you get used to the grappling hook, especially after you upgrade it. 
But want me to be completely honest? I find it extremely difficult to go back to Palworld after having tried Enshrouded. Enshrouded offers some sort of Depth that Palworld just doesn't. It's not perfect, but what is?

EDIT 50 HOURS IN: 
Love the game, I'm a god now and nothing can come close to me. Dodging is for pussies, jumping and gliding around to avoid getting hit is where it's at.

Negatives - Nothing really beside trolls/griefers in public games.

-They also seem to feel the need to remove flames or even your whole house.
I managed to get find 1 fresh server to help someone out and felt like it was all pointless. With no way to warn them of what will most likely come..

But aside from that b.s... The game is great solo and even better with friends. My recommendation is to have each person have their own personal world with it's own progression.

- The graphics, especially the lighting, are pretty good. It's not an eyesore nor does it break the foundation of gaming visuals. It's essentially a high-res Valhiem, if I were to make a comparison. 

Gameplay:
- The movement of the game is the biggest highlight of the gameplay. A lot of people will consider combat first--but I am a believer in the idea that much of what makes good combat is good movement. The movement, with elements like the parachute/glider, the blink spell and the double jump, all allow for a much more interactive experience when dealing with terrain and mobs. When it comes to terrain, the running and gliding are very smooth to control and gliding is my favorite method of traversal as it's the most satisfying feel. There is the grappling hook mechanic that is a great and enjoyable part of movement in this game. However, in the future, making it possible to have a terrain grappling hook as opposed to the normal grappling hook, that requires a player-built anchor to use, would give the player a lot more freedom of movement. Naturally, however, this would be best available more mid-to-late game to have a use for the unlockable waypoint towers. As for combat movement, the blink spell and the double jump both allow for a much more interactive experience when dealing with mobs. Dodging too, allows for the player to be a lot more selective with their engagement choices when it comes to the combat.

- On that topic, the combat is fairly well done. With a built in blocking system for both players and AI, it allows for the player to be more selective with their attacks. There is also a parry and stun system, both of which are great. 
- The AI is smarter than in most games which is great. The AI, if out of reach of the player and still suffers damage from the player, will often move to a safe spot out of sight of the player forcing the player to either ignore them or adjust positioning. Something they could do to improve combat with various mobs would be introducing a good dodging system for the AI. It would make combat more engaging as they already have a blocking system but also allow for more classes to shine (this will be touched on in the difficulty category).

The skill tree is great if not a bit limited. The tree is split into three zones based off of primary stats. The Strength/Constitution zone (which includes the classes Tank, Warrior, Barbarian and Athlete), Endurance/Dexterity zone (includes Survivor, Ranger, Beast Master, and Assassin) and the Intelligence/Spirit zone (Battle Mage, Healer, Wizard, and Trickster). Every zone is designed for a player to build into one of three classes: Ranger, Wizard and Tank. Everything else acts as a subclass, however, some sub classes are much more effective and add stronger and more useful abilities than others (the effectiveness of each class will be briefly covered in the difficulty category). However, the skill tree allows the player to be creative and most skill paths and upgrades add effects to the gameplay to a healthy degree. The only request I'd have to alter the fundamentals of the skill tree is to add more sub-classes or classes to the skill tree that would effectively increase the variety. It feels as if some of the classes are unnecessarily limited which, in turn, limits the player's creativity as well. If the max level will stay as 25 post-early access, then I stress that the skill tree's variety be improved even more. 

- A brief mention about the NPCS, they are great, naturally I hope we will receive more of them in the future developments of the game. To add to this, I would suggest for a larger and immersive experience, even adding a party system for NPCS to tag along with players for their respective quests. (This goes doubly for story).

Audio: 
- Well done. Good and immersive sound effects for everything, this includes voice actors for the 5 NPC's.

Audience:
- Anyone who isn't geriatric 

PC Requirements:
- Decent specs needed
- I run well over the requirements stated on the Store page, game runs very smoothly with the occasional fps drop for world generation of brand new areas.

Game Size:
- The map is huge--however, roughly half is blocked off by a barrier for Early Access. However, still looking at a solid 70-120 hours of gameplay.

Difficulty:
- Entirely class-based. Quick run downs: 
--Tanks make a large chunk of the game easy when compared to other classes. From what I've experienced, the tankier classes seem to have the easiest time fighting anything and everything. They take little damage and hit like a truck, sacrificing speed for outgoing dps, especially if you multi-class into warrior or barbarian for some extra parry and stun effects. One thing that the Strength zone has on every other zone is that any of the Strength classes could be a main, while the others support--depending on your fighting preferences. 
--Wizards and/or battle mages emphasize large damage from long range (staffs) or easy damage from short range (the wand). Any spell caster who gets an eternal spell is safe from any practical harm, especially with the passive healing capabilities if multi-classed into healer. With the effect of the blink attribute, it also makes mages and/or spell casters difficult to hit and increases evasion (naturally). 
--After the aforementioned classes, everything else scales from easiest to hardest gameplay: trickster/assassin, ranger, survivor, beast master. 
---Trickster is essentially the DND's Monk and 
---Assassin serves as a buff to ranger and doesn't truly have much in the traditional sense of assassin
---Ranger, the bow class that deals moderate to high damage from long range. Very weak close up, however, maneuverability with the Survivor class is great.
---Survivor, like the Assassin, it serves as a buff but more as a buff to all classes and quality of life.
---Beast Master, this class seems to be the hardest class to main as it has maybe one good and practical thing to invest into and that is the Endurance of the Flame attribute. Besides that, beast master--despite sounding quite intriguing--is less exciting in the skill tree and again, serves as a buff to ranger. An argument can be made that it emphasizes Survivor's effectiveness. It would be nice if the Beast Master could cast spells of their own--like DND's druid--that can emphasize it's namesake and allow the conjuring or taming of wild animals. It would give Beast Masters not only a practical use (for example, tames that can allow easy traversal of terrain or easier gathering of materials) but also a use in battle (for example, killing).

Grind:
- Not like Valhiem and can teleport with metal materials, which puts it one step ahead of the average grind of a survival game. 

Story:
- Good story and perfectly weaved into the progression the player takes to move into the next regions. It's balanced well with the players progress into the next regions. 

Game Time:
- You're looking at a good 70-130 hours for a play through of the current Early Access version. 

Price:
- Worth the price.

Bugs:
- Character and Mob's can clip into walls or objects due to shifts in positioning. For example, landing with the glider and sliding across the ground into a box--you'd get stuck in the box or rolling/double jumping and landing in between two solid objects that you then get stuck in between. 
- Sometimes textures stay, like harvested trees have ghost-textures, the dirt and stone ground both have similar issues. Additionally, the glider texture may stay every now and then even after landed--a quick restart fixes the issue.
- Lighting cuts through ceilings or flickers on the floor in enclosed spaces every now and then
- Summary: No game-breaking bugs.

Rating:
- Solid 8/10 for an early access title. 
- A lot of potential for future developments in every category.
- Over all, an enjoyable experience and scratches that survival/adventurous itch.",1707359360,1707359360,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The graphics are ok - nothing special. Same goes for the audio. Gameplay is fun though and forces you to get a little creative which is actually nice. There are usually multiple ways to solve a problem which is also nice. The ""shroud"" mechanic is kind of interesting - tougher monsters and unique items can be found should you dare venture into the misty dungeons where most of the bosses lurk. However, this is where you'll also dramatically improve both your character with drops and improve your ability to build better and larger homesteads, so it's more than worth it.

The map itself seems quite huge and is fun to explore once you craft yourself a glider and can zip from place to place a whole lot more quickly than going by foot. A grappling hook mechanic also lends itself to quicker movement but it can be easy to miss the specific grapple points unless you're specifically looking for them already. Enemies are usually fairly dimwitted but be warned if you get into a bunch of battles BEFORE crafting yourself a nice set of armor and a nice weapon - you probably WILL get demolished by even the wolves that seem to ubiquitously roam the countryside.

Overall, the game seems huge and is quite fun to play so far - I'm definitely looking forward to exploring more of the map (without resorting to looking things up especially!). I've encountered shroud areas that are ""deadly"" and these currently seem impassable but in true video game fashion, I'm sure I'll soon either find a way around or be able to craft something that lets me survive more than 3 seconds when I step in it.

All in all, highly recommended if you like terraforming/interacting with your environment (a la minecraft), building/crafting (think satisfactory or, more accurately, valheim), and lots of exploration (feels a LITTLE like a legend of zelda game in this sense at least).",1707358506,1707358506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

93 Hour Edit:
After completing the available content, I found myself where I do with most survival games. Wanting to do more but having no reason to do it. I understand that games have to end, and I had a lot of fun with this one. One of my favorite moments was running along the top of a plateau with a friend and seeing our shadows a mile off in the distance. But in the end, the survival and craft aspects are just ""loot complicators"", more work that had to be done to go back to playing an adventure game. I think this is an inherent issue with survival craft games, so I'm not blaming this studio for falling victim to it. 


4 Hours in and did not experience any technical issues. Playing on a server with 4 slots, with two friends. Edit: We did experience a handful of instances with reset progress, due to a known (but unresolved) issue. We figured out that letting the server reset itself was causing some type of error that preventing future saves. We turned this off and just reset the server manually each day, only having an issue if the game tried to update and restart the server on it's own. 

Combat feels best on a controller to me, somewhat souls/zelda-like feel to it. There is a sharp increase in difficulty from the starting mobs to the next tier, but we might have taken them on a hair early. Edit: Difficulty scales well. The hardest things are hard and the easiest things are easy. Seems right. 

Building system has a lot of potential, but I did find it frustrating to get pieces to line up to where I want them. I hope this will improve, because the building system seems ""limitless"" in terms of creativity. I did find that building is easier on keyboard & mouse. Edit: Unfortunately, like many games, the only reason to build a base is because the game tells you that certain things need a roof over them, and that's about it. There was no real reason to keep building, or challenges to overcome with clever building. The building system is fantastic, but ultimately it feels like a mechanic that really didn't need to be in the game. 

There are some huge quality of life elements to the game in regards to inventory management and interface features. Honestly, if you're a survival craft developer...pay attention to what Enshrouded is doing! The dual layer hot bar works great, even on controller. The system for putting/pulling stacks from boxes is also very well done. 

My only real let down so far is that the grappling hook is context based, so there are only some random areas around the map where it can be used and these mostly feel tacked on. A friend mentioned that maybe there will be some areas where it becomes a little trickier, such as in a boss encounter or something like that. Edit: A little bit, but definitely missing the full potential of grappling hooks. 

Speaking of bosses, the first boss glitched into a rock and basically stood there while I emptied 20 arrows into him. I took but, but hopefully this isn't a common glitch. Edit: Some bosses were extremely challenging, others were not. It seemed to be a 50/50 as to whether a boss would glitch into the ground and become useless, but mostly the challenge felt appropriate for a party of 2-3 players. 

I had to make myself log out for the night, an hour after I needed to, and that's a good sign! All that remains to be seen is how far you have to get until the world feels conquered and whether it's still fun to play afterwards.",1706158942,1707354434,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

so lets discus why didn't mention any of the combat, exploration, and story as a positive. 

TL;DR 
Do buy this game for the base building
Dont expect any survival mechanics, challenging combat, immersion in the story, or rewarding loot pools.

combat. 
the combat is a literal joke. most encounters can be cheesed by walking slightly to the left or right. the AI is so dumb you can jump up on slightly raised platform and as long as your feet are at their chest or higher they will just run into your toes and not attack you. (baring ranged combatants obviously)
ranged combatants dont have predictive projectile pasterns, in other words they shoot where you are not where your going. so again just walking slowly to the left or right at the correct distance trivialises and ranged combatant.

boss fights (SPOILERS)
ive fought everything up to and including the wyvern, and i killed the wyvern with a lvl 3 short sword which il touch on why i was using that in the looting and crafting section. the only boss that stood out as mildly difficult was the one they nerfed for accidental making one of their attacks hit too hard. again most of the bosses like the other mobs can be cheesed by steping slightly in one direction or another. 

Exploration: 
the world is large and interesting and they have many fast travel locations scattered about, and gliding makes getting around very accessible as well, combine that with the flame alters you can place and there probably isnt any where on the map that will take you more than a minute to get to once your set up.

Which is why i cant for the life of me understand why they have a stamina drain ooc mechanic. for those who dont know ooc (out of combat) stamina drain for things like sprinting, mining, etc... are often put into to make traversing the map take longer, and there for the game feel bigger. but there are already more effective and faster ways to get around the map than running... so all it does in this situation is penile the player for  using the method of travel that will expose them to the most fun little sections and secrets of the game. 

ooc stamina drain and mining. 
there are already different tiers of mining tools that allow to mine faster and more effectivly, and mining tools have a durability bar that runs out faster than my first time. so again the only reason to have stamina drain while ooc mining is to artificiality make the game feel longer.... nothing is more fun than waiting 2 minutes for your stamina bar to recharge to spend another 30 seconds mining to get 3 tin and repeat the wait cycle.

stamina has its place in combat as a resource to be monitored and respected for blocking and dodging when the AI gets improved and you actually need to do those things hopefully eventually rather than just side stepping. but this game has 0 need to incorporate it ooc

the story. 
i honestly couldn't tell you if there was story because all of it is stuck behind finding and reading lore notes you pick up off the ground, most of time while one guy you missed in the fight teleport behind you and smacks you while your trying to read it. i thought we all learned this was bad story telling from the destiny series.. 

loot and crafting. 
My biggest complaint with the loot and crafting systems for gear is that there doesnt seem to be a good way to target specific items. i made my build based on sword and board, and i have found exactly 1 (one) tiered single handed sword in the 30 hours ive played. tiered meaning it has a rarity associated with it such as rare, epic, legendary. this is why i used that lvl 3 sword to kill that boss mentioned above.... meanwhile i have found 10 legendary bows, countless staffs and wands of epic quality, and 15 legendary 2 handed weapons. again only 1 sword in the 30 hours ive found all that other stuff. 

this lack of being able to target specific gear or types of gear is bad game design that i thought had been done away with for a while now. it makes you feel forced into using certain items which takes away from the play your way style the game seems to want to be built around with its large skill tree and verity of weapons and armours. 

the other issue i have is that crafted armour is almost always better than looted armour. unlike the weapons there doesn't seem to be tiers of rarity for armour. theirs just armour you can craft, and armour you cant. and the armour you cant seems to be a clone of what you can but with a rebuff accompanying it. for example the helm i just looted is almost identical the adventures helm you can make, but you loose shroud time for wearing it. 

survival game? 
im not sure how it got the survival tag tbh, you could play the entire game without ever crafting a shelter, eating food, or drinking water and the only determent would be that you wouldn't have 150% stamina and would be missing out on like 5 EXTRA stat points. youd essentially be playing regularly without buffs. 

Eating food and drinking potions to bring your stats higher than normal is an RPG mechanic not a survival one. eating food and drinking water to not starve or dehydrate to death would be survival mechanics.
 building a house is only a survival mechanic if you.... wouldnt survive without one, such as environmental hazards or raids. (these dont exist in this game).
this game is an exploration rpg with a couple town sim elements.

Building is good, but some of their design choices for the blocks are braindead. Wanted to get the half timbered blocks because they look good on the premade houses, but building with them yourself adds stupid studs to the bottom of the walls that triples the width of them. Or you have to deal with clipping and place objects inside of them. 

There is no option for bloom/brightness, the game itself during the day is incredibly white washed, and the only way to adjust it is through Nvidia control panel. You get flashbanged every time you enter a building and exit it.

The game feels a like a kick starter title whose graphics and game play are pretty good but not great. The building aspect has a lot I think you will be able to do with it if you are into that but the challenge doesn't completely seem to be there for me yet. 

Game play could be way better and much more challenging. The graphics are pretty decent. They need a better system in place to make you feel like you have to do things in order to survive. It feels like a game world and not one that feels alive. When your get into the abandoned towns it kind of has a small sense of being formerly inhabited but not really.

I am having fun with exploring and discovering this world that is supposed to be really large but manages to still feel generic at many points. The shroud areas are a pretty cool concept but end up feeling meh. 

It sounds like I don't like the game but I actually do. I find myself playing just to unlock the next armor set or be able to upgrade. This may all be me doing this just for the sake of wanting to though. It is hard to find anything as a real necessity to survive but more so for the adventure of exploring a new game. 

Valheim is one that makes you explore to get more in order to upgrade discover and live. Unshrouded seems like a game that has you explore and have small generic challenges here and there in order to be a peaceful and relaxing game at the end of your days real work. For this reason, I do say Yes to a buy if you want it for that reason. It is No to buy if you are looking for a very challenging and all put together adventure title. 

I do think there is a good base game here but it needs a tremendous amount of work from graphics to game play.

The main issue is the game tries hard to be a MMO when it's really not.  This game IS NOT a survival game, IT IS a RPG game with 'survival elements"", namely building.

If you played Valheim and loved the exploration and building aspect of the world, making your mark as a player and enjoying the triumphs when you found the swamp iron crypts, or silver in the mountains, know that Enshrouded is probably not for you.  Why you ask?

Enshrouded has easy resources, and they respawn endlessly.  The first major patch even shortened the respawn timer for everything to 30 minutes.  So all those pesky resources you scrimped and saved for in Valheim?  They are literally righto outside your door in Enshrouded.  Same eith major loot, and enemies, everything respawns, incl;uding any player changes to the world via terraforming that's not directly in the player base.

Who would like Enshrouded...  1) Those who feel the entire concept that survival games are built around, resource scarcity and exploration, are a ""waste of my time!!!11!!!"", 2) those who want a participation award and head pat for simply showing up to any sort of competition, 3) those who want a RPG game that has the player do minimal resource gathering and (limited) building, 4) those who don't want anything load bearing when they build since the game doesn't really care if you have a floating roof or any real sort of support needed to build, 5) those who want empty NPC's that don't do anything except stand there but that you have to interact with to craft.

Who should stay away from Enshrouded.. 1)Those who like to explore and maker a change in the world and have it reflect all your hard work and effort, 2) those who want true progression where when you kill a boss they STAY DEAD and the world reflects that victory, 3) those who want tougher situations related to resources like having to go into progressively harder zones for more difficult to acquire items and resources, 4) those who want a real reward for their hard work and effort of exploring and finding and then exploiting resources and enemies, 5) those who like to WIN competitions and triumph against the environment and the enemies and not simply show up.

Someone best described Enshrouded as a ""game designed by committee"" where they said ""hey this game has this cool feature, lets add that!"" but many of the systems either don't fit in the current world design or are pointless (like farming, which is pointless when all the organic resources respawn every 30 minutes).  Even Palworld is more tightly put together where at least the systems in that game all work together and make sense in the world.

Enshrouded feels more like the G-rated Nintendo version of a survival world.  This is fine if that's what it's target was, but anyone who wants anything with a real effort, or a game that shows real player change as you move the story along would be better suited to try any of the other games in the genre.",1706676801,1707349292,False,3,0,0.531189501285552979,0,True,False,True

It's an exploration survival rpg with a similar progression system to Valheim. You explore, collect mats, fight mobs and bosses until you hit a wall and cannot go further. Then you return to base do a little building and crafting necessary upgrades to move forward. Then you go out and explore again. That is essentially the gameplay loop and it feels great and natural. It does offer some rpg elements like leveling up, skill trees, spells, unique weapons and armor. I do wished it was a little more in depth but it's good for what it is all things considered. The building system and mechanics in this game is excellent it's one of the best ones out there. I think it's even better than Valhiem's since it doesn't have certain restrictions like support beams and it also allows you to put down single blocks of material. This may not seem like a big deal but when you are building more advance stuff you will realize that having this ability is a game changer and will allow you to have very unique builds. I have 60+ hours of game play and essentially 100% the early access content. I'm missing two achievements which are the flame shrines that I'm just to lazy to go collect in the final two regions.

Another major flaw to the game is that it is rather easy. The only problem I ran into was a berserker type characters. The bosses I killed were either simple or terrain would hinder from attacking me directly. 

Finally the developers are political. Apparently there are some politically charged messaging in the game which I didn't notice. For example the devs used ""craftpeople"" instead of craftsmen. Given it is Early Access, the developer could add more political content in the future. They also were perma banning people from the forums without just cause. I was hit with one because I referenced a political joke that the Palworld developer have in their game and apparently the Enshrouded devs didn't find it humorous.

I love this game a lot, and out of love of this game I feel there's so many things that can be improved to overall make the game a better experience. some elements of the exploration become repetitive. it feels as though you're fighting the same monsters again and again, so while the environments change, the experience doesn't seem like it does really. on top of that, the loot doesn't really feel rewarding most of the time. i'm just looting the same garbage over and over again, no matter if it's a small hut, large intricate house, or castle. 

there were a lot of times when we stumbled upon a spooky entrance going underground expecting almost like a dungeon-like experience only for it to be a few rooms with some string and one mob, when it feels like it could be so so much more. at the moment I'm continuing to play it because I love the immersion, but also because I yearn to see something different and hoping that the more hours I put in the more likely that will happen.

overall, it was exciting in the beginning but kind of repetitive 10 hours in. more bosses, more exciting different things that are less sparse and distanced away from each other so that each region I visit has something new going for it would definitely excite me so much more. 

as it stands right now as an early access though, I love it for what it is. it immerses me into an expansive fantasy world and draws me in for hours at a time and that's a difficult thing to do for a game these days. so I would recommend it for its value 100%.",1707203704,1707347581,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

This is one of those situations where I really wish Steam would give us a middle-ground category.  When they ask us “Would you recommend this game?” it would be great to answer, “It’s ok” instead of having to go with a flat-out yes or no.  With that said, it’s my belief those who would get the most out of my personal experience with this game will be looking at the “No” category, which is why I’ve selected that option while still giving this game a 7/10.

When my gaming crew was looking for a new game to play, Enshrouded seemed to come highly recommended.  We’re very fond of survival games, having played everything from Ark and Conan to 7Days and Staxel.  The entire RPG player progression in Enshrouded seemed to ensure that we’d all have roles to fill, which was a huge plus in our eyes.  We made the dive and everyone in our crew bought the game.

I can’t really say much to the opening of the game, seemed to be a typical RPG introduction.  Nothing really special but nothing horrible.  Next thing we knew we were in the world, coming out of some kind of ancient pods.  As we moved into the world the tutorial took over.  Do this, do that, do something else.  We gained a grasp of crafting, movement, and setting up a base.  Up until this point the game seemed really good.  After this point, at least for me, the enjoyment of the game would fall off really quickly.

The one task that I always take on in pretty much every survival game is the base builder.  As soon as the knowledge of building a base is unlocked, I’m on it.  Foundations get placed, walls go up, roof slapped on, doors, windows, and done.  I always want to ensure my party has a safe place to return to, rest up, and prepare for their next excursion.  In Enshrouded there was no difference.  As soon as we had a spot picked out, I went to work building.  While I switched into building mode my party was still doing some of the little quest popups.  We knew about the progression system, how nobody misses out on quests being completed, so this didn't seem like a problem.  At first...

The way Enshrouded works is that all players have a linked progression.  You only really need one person to complete a quest and it completes for everyone.  While the benefit of this is that nobody misses out on quests, the drawback is that the teammates who aren’t with you miss out on story.  In addition, the developers decided that a good way to tell lore was to leave little lore books all over the place.  Unfortunately, if the party splits up, that means not everyone gets to read all the lore books.  In an RPG game, this is a HUGE problem.  In a game like Enshrouded, where you’re relying on players to learn this lore, it’s a MASSIVE problem.  As a DM for Dungeons and Dragons, I can tell you that a person’s enjoyment of a world is solely linked to their connection to that world.  If they don’t feel a connection to that world they aren’t going to enjoy it.  Look at how drawn-in you were right at the start of Skyrim.  Look at how invested you were at the start of Fallout 4.  Even going back as far as Starcraft and Diablo, how you felt like the world revolved around your choices and you couldn’t wait for the story to progress.  Anyway…

As I said, while I was building the base my party went off and completed some of the quests that had popped up.  Suddenly I had the ability to place a blacksmith at the base.  I have no idea who this blacksmith is or why he joined us.  He’s just part of the base now.  Once the base was finally completed our quest read to go infiltrate an “Elixir Well”…  In my head I’m going, ""What the hell is an Elixir Well?"" and ""Why are we going there?""  I mean, by this point I had completely lost the entire story of the game.  I had no clue why my character exists.  No idea what my ultimate goal was.  Am I just surviving?  Am I a hero?  I feel like I have no attachment to this world at all.  At this point my character’s entire existence is just following my party around helping them defeat stuff.  ""Ooooo, watch out!  I’m a stealthy Ranger!  Fear me!""

Since my experience with the game took place in a very specific multiplayer environment, I'm not going to say that your experience will be the same.  At the time of this writing, I don't feel any attachment to my character or the world of Enshrouded.  I have no idea what the story is or my part in it.  It just feels like a basic, generic, survival game.

In all fairness though, I have no doubt that Enshrouded is a great RPG game with a really good story to it.  That said, it feels as though the game was written for solo play and then a co-op system was added almost as an afterthought.  It would seem to explain why one player can practically complete all the quests while the rest of the party sits at the base.  At any rate, this review is based on my experience and, ""it's ok"" is about all I can say.",1707345383,1707346645,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

You've already played this game before more then likely, I struggled to get through my 8hrs because it's too familiar. So instead I will just take this time to espouse some knowledge which might explain why something this ""ok"" could become so big.

You see a long long time ago in a far far away land called ""Europe"" there was once a very wealthy family who decided to get into finance and banking. But how? It's a hard door to get a foot in, there must be some way to become a titan of this sector that someone hasn't thought of.... A way to side step the decades needed to build such a enterprise. That way revealed itself when a man decided he was Emperor and would claim his empire, that man was Napoleon! 

""I ALREADY SAW THAT MOVIE! IT HAD THE GUY FROM GLADIATOR IN IT!"" Well that was a overly sexualized fantasy lie dreamt up by sociopaths who've become so numb to pleasure from living in complete excess so long all they can do is think of perversions and new ways to experience them and that bleeds over into everything they do. Explains how twisted western culture has become because the owners of the outlets which dictate it are all psychopaths and deviants.

This family saw a great chance in this aggressive Emperor and his campaign to form an Empire. As Napoleon marched forth against an opposing army this wealthy family decided to play a trick, they sent a man to Britain with a lie that allowed them to buy almost the entire British financial system in 1 day. That lie was Napoleon had won, thinking the war was over and Napoleon was unstoppable a sell off began, and who was there to buy up everything at a fraction of it's original price? This family was. 

See this family discovered that by using war they could dominate nations with money, with DEBT. After this discovery wars began all across Europe and this family funded both sides of every single war indebting all those who participate so no matter how the war went both sides would end up bought and paid for as indebted slaves. 

A nation arose, one who opposed the global order. A new land! A place to escape this misery machine of death and debt! AMERICA! Recently freed from their British masters who were actually just slaves to this one family hiding in the shadows they experienced prosperity like never seen before! Cotton in the south combined with the Cotton Gin made America a world leader and financial king. This family saw a plan forming in the economic disparity between the N and South of the US. The south was sending a lot of money up north and they loved spending. 

This animosity was the way in, this was the key to get this new nation into debt which would bring it into slavery once again. Like Grima Wormtongue from LOTR they whispered in the South's ear ""You don't need the north! You make all the money! We'll support you!"" while whispering in the North's ear at the same time 'These men are ungodly and prideful, they are slavers and rebels! They need to be brought to heel!"". A civil war began aided in large part by backroom deals/promises/money. History would say it was a noble war for the freedom of slaves failing to cite the fact that the slaves were only freed so they could serve in the Union Army which was ailing. Ask yourself this, if it really was about freeing slaves then why did black people suffer for so long after at the hands of the gov that ""freed"" them? It's almost like ending slavery wasn't the real reason for the war huh? Food for thought....

This family once again played both sides firmly indebting this rowdy upstart nation. After the civil war, Lincoln was removed because of his opposition to becoming essentially a colony again, the United States Reorganization Act was implemented creating Washington DC (it's not your ""typical"" capitol btw, look into it), and selling the ""federal reserve"" to this family (Federal is in it's name to make you think it isn't a foreign owned private bank which it is). 

And ever since this rebel nation which dared to stand up against the global order was enslaved and used as a battering ram to enslave other nations. See that is the punishment for removing ones chains, you will then be forced to clap others in them as a form of humiliation. 

The family's name is ROTHSCHILD. They became the rulers of the western world and the oppressors of the 3rd world. 

""Money is the god of our time, and Rothschild is his prophet,"" wrote the German philosopher Heinrich Heine.

BONUS FACT: JP Morgan backed Napoleon against the Rothschild's knowing they'd lose but also knowing that the debt they'd owe Morgan would be paid back in full with interest because of the robust French economy of the time. He made his fortune from death as well. 

BONUS FACT #2: The lie about Napoleon winning taught the Rothschild's that information is power, I wonder why information is being so tightly controlled and free speech is being stifled?

BONUS FACT #3: The CIA funded the Taliban or ""Muhjahideen"" in the 80's and 90's to fight Russia in Afghanistan. ""Radicalizing islam"" was seen as an effective means of raising support and fighters for the war so the CIA starting influencing imans and religious leaders to give a more violent and aggressive interpretation of Islam. Osama Bin Laden worked closely with the CIA and was trained by them. His family has close ties to the Bush's and was flown out of the US immediately following 9/11 for their safety. The hijackers were ""KNOWN"" to the FBI/CIA like almost every mass shooter and terrorist that happens to just slip through the most advanced web of spying the world has ever known..... Weird how they are always known or always picked up at some point then let go right before some catastrophe happens.

Now you know why Congress has not approved 1 war since WW1 and they've all been illegal since, now you know why the US is constantly at war but reaps none of the benefits aside from more DEBT, now you know who it is who profits from the loans needed to rebuild DESTROYED NATIONS and what that debt does to their sovereignty, now you know why the 5 eyes intelligence alliance seems to be weaponized and turned inward on itself. 

This entire planet is owned and ran by bankers who believe in something called ""Eugenics"", go look it up, it'll explain much of what you are seeing today.

You do not have to be a slave, you are a HUMAN BEING, you are not your race, your sex, your nationality, you are HUMAN! We all are HUMAN! They pit us against each other and highlight our differences and put them on blast across all media so we will HATE EACH OTHER AND NEVER SEE WHO IS REALLY DOING ALL THIS! WAKE UP!

All our differences fall under the umbrella of humanity, the separation is the illusion they've created in order to divide us. They promote manufactured social trends in order to inflame division through high powered AI driven algorithms designed to make you operate solely on emotion so you will shut out all dissenting voices and remained closed off to the truth.

Childhood is ending, it's time to grow up humanity. You live in nightmare whether you want to acknowledge it or not, it's only this scary because you haven't noticed it before. Bite through the fear and face your enemy, know your enemy.

Ofc all of this is just story I made up in this review because reality couldn't be that scary..... Would make a good game plot though wouldn't it?

Having done nearly all the early access content as of 2/7/2024 I would definitely recommend this game, I would however suggest, that you wait just a little for some more content to come out. The ammount of content in the current state of the game is well worth the money in quality and quantity, but once you get to the end, you get a feeling of ""awe.......that's it?"" I only hit the end of its current state last night, and i'm still upset that i have to wait for the next episode to come out. I still plan to look around for any sneakrets i missed, and I want to build my tower castle, so i'll still have a good amount to do for a bit. But if you're like me, and hate waiting for more of something. Wait for a few more content patches.

Combat - I'll get the bad side out of the way first. the combat is nothing impressive.Early on it can feel a little daunting, but all you have to do is aim for getting level 3-4 before really pushing forward and you'll likely be fine. Current state of the game is that wands are really over powered. I really hate the idea of wands in games at all, go back to pary hotter land am i right? the timed parry system is pretty solid, and blocking is maybe a little too strong. Bows are expensive because of the amunition, but i'm going to try messing around with non magic builds soonish. I fully expect that the combat system is going to be changed a bit over the course of early access. Dying isn't nearly as annoying as you might expect. it says you drop your stuff on death, but you really only drop a huge chuck of your inventory, which right now doesn't include your hotbar, or equipped gear, which is a very nice bit. Dying should have a consequence to make fighting actually meaningful, but it's NOT so frustrating that you have to have 2 sets of equipment, 1 for adventuring, and another for getting your stuff after you die, which is very nice.

Creatures - The creatures are pretty neat, mostly the wildlife. The enemies you have to deal with, why magnificently rendered, are very few. scavengers have only about 6 types, including the boss scav. the enshrouded zombayz only have about 10 types currently, including the bosses, but not including the corrupted wildlife. i'm really hoping that they add a few more unit models to the game to add a little more flavor. The wildlife is very cool though, I want one of the bunnies. I want one of the....dear?

Building - Building is very simple and forgiving. I've never been great at building stuff because i'm not creative at all in a visual sense. There's Lots of different types of materials you can use for your structures, which leads to a lot of experimenting. Decorations and such take a little while to accumulate to where you feel like you can do much, but i expect more will come over time. 

Crafting - Crafting is relatively simple and easy to grasp. A few times I was impatient and googled where to get certain matterials, but all in all if you love exploring, you're going to get the mats you're wanting as you progress through the game, and you'll do so at a very smooth rate. Some of the crafting production things are pretty annoying with the timers and some of the base resource requirements, but all in all, if you set up your stuff to run, then go out adventuring, you'll likely have what you need by the time you get back. Some of the production structure things are a tad costly, like the stupid bee hive. All in all, if you see you need a new material and you haven't seen it yet, don't fret, and don't google. Just look at your map, see where you havn't checked yet and get to exploring.

Exploring - This game reminds me a lot of how i felt when i was very young, exploring games like fable and morrowind/oblivion, and more recently, subnautica. I often times will have left my base with a clear objective, ""check out this location on the map"". More often than not, I'd get distracted by something else tantalizing that i'd see in the distance on my way there. Some times doing so much side adventuring, that my inventory would be full before reaching my original destination, having to port back to base and dump, then start heading there all over again. The areas are quite pretty, currently with 5 biomes, but undoubtedly more will come, as early access only gives you access to what looks like, 30% of the map, maybe even a little less.

Quality of life - This is a big one for lots of people when it comes to crafting survival, and crafting adventure games. The first part of this is travel time. Early on, traveling is an absolute chore, and takes a little while before traveling feels exciting or interesting. There are fast travel points in the game, but only a few of them. You can however put down multiple flame alters (land claim blocks) which allow you to teleport to them. As far as traveling goes, you also get a glider, which  early on, just helps get places a little faster, but as you get better gliders, you're able to cover much greater distances much faster. Additionally, the better gliders are just a lot of fun, I found myself just trying to see where I could get to. The current state of the game, will also end up with more skill points than you need for your build, allowing you to throw quite a few into gathering skills, and movement skills
 --base quality of life. Storage and access to it early on is definitely a chore, but as you progress through the content, you'll gain access to lots of nice little perks for your base. Giving you a nice feeling of ""i'm getting stronger, and conquering the land, and my reward is these nice bonuses"" This gives a very good relationship between the player, and the world which needs exploring. As you see ""oh I got this great thing....well it's not super great, but its definitely nice, there must be better things for me to get if i keep going""

All in all, the game isn't anything amazing, This is mostly due to the story being relatively vague, and the combat being a little flavorless. However, the adventuring alone makes this game stand out. The art style has a familiar feeling, but things are just unfamiliar enough to inspire curiosity. Lush forests where you wonder ""why would that shack be there? I bet there's something off the trail towards that cliff!"" The part of the map currently available is definitely quite large, and you can see the borders of the map containing what you can currently explore dwarfs it greatly.",1707344505,1707344505,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Enshrouded is kinda like a mix between Skyrim and Terraria in 3D
The world is interesting and beautifully crafted. The building system is VERY well done, fun and organic while looting, exploring and crafting are working nicely together.
Fighting is simple enough but not boring especially with more advanced enemies

80 Hours in, there's technically a bit more in-depth crafting like drying hides and what not, but it's not standard like your other survival games. I'ts very linear progression where some recipes require the previous tier to craft, but not every item is like that. I personally wished the crafting recipes were a bit more refined, but i've enjoyed it.

Map is massive, i've nearly explored most of it and it's like, maybe 1/4th of the full map for early access (barrier that tells you to turn back). I'm assuming the rest will either unlock over time, or it there for expansions.

I've had my fun.



Fantasy/Medieval Valheim without boats, hand crafted world (ie. pregenerated)

- Lite-RPG Skill system not too bad; takes forever to really level, so don't expect any real RPG here. You can gain XP by mining this one type of metal, but can't get XP any other way other than killing and exploring. (like you get 45xp killing a mob, takes 10,000xp to get to level 2 for an example)

- Crafting System is...lite for the most part. Not very in-depth; wished there was more common crafting like getting hide/leather, drying, or gathering ore, smelting, make iron bars...no. Does not exist, but not bad either. A lot of items feel scarce in the beginning, but once you realize workbench repairs all your gear to 100% just by using....10 hours in.....makes things a lot easier. 

- exploration is nice; being able to create fast travel points up to a certain amount until you upgrade your flame/homebase. Everything you do outside your homebase such as digging the dirt, blowing up places--this will reset over time back as if you never did anything.

- Building is where this game shines; if you're a nut in just building bases, you will definitely enjoy this.

I was hoping for a more medieval crafter/survival type of game and this wasn't it, but this is still a fun game for the price. Worth it.",1706224702,1707342755,True,3,0,0.521239042282104492,0,True,False,True

Wish I could recommend this game.  I got $25 worth of entertainment but the melee combat in this game is underwhelming and when a large portion of your gameplay feels like crap then cant rightly recommend the game.

Game has potential but they need to do something about the parry system, and melee trees, both feel like complete junk.

Building feels fantastic, exploring the world - interesting. Crafting, piling up resources for gear, stocking on consumables - your inner hoarder will be glad. 
Combat is nice, yes there are some questionable aspects here and there, but overall - fun. 
Don't be fooled by a ""Survival"" tag, though. This is more of Adventure-Exploration game, to my understanding. In a sense, that Survival game usually forces your character to do something to maintain certain levels of hunger/thirst/temperature/etc. 
Enshrouded utilizes food/water and other parameters more as buffs rather than necessity.

So you run in a vast world exploring, finding places of interest, unlocking new materials and recipes, returning to base to craft and process your findings, which allows you to upgrade your gear and travel further. You get experience, level up your characters, investing skill points into multiple classes/sub classes.

Edit: if you know what ""Marching Cubes Algorithm"" is, these guys have turned it into a work of art. The voxel corners are weighted better than usual for a marching cubes terrain, but the construction block-types also seem to have an incredibly artistic and nuanced corner-weighting as well, that instead of adjusting the height of the voxel's vertices, it instead applies a rubble effect to the voxel.

What this means is, there is almost no place you can look at the voxels and tell they are voxels, even if you throw a grenade at a cottage. The edges of the explosion will naturally create smooth rubble visuals that match the building's material. Ruined bridges with holes in them look like they came straight out of assassin's creed or something, but it's all voxels.

UPDATE: Still exploring this VAST world and am over 150 hours. I just want to say to the developers/designers/writers: 
The amount of love put into the design and implementation of Embervale's geographic diversity is incredible. There are POI's as FAR as the eye can see, and in between each, i'd say HUNDREDS of hidden secrets. It cannot be stated enough, that this is a VAST world to explore with SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU COULD EVER SINK YOUR TEETH INTO in less than i'd say 180 hours of exploring.

^ also with all that stated, the game is in Early Access and I have to point out that also means MOST of the map is restricted and you cannot go into it. This means that you already get an unheard of, and STAGGERING, amount of stuff to explore and its like, 30% of the overall planned map size. This is amazing.

I'll try to offer info on stuff most reviews won't go into.

You can tank. Like, you can keep threat, so your teammates can get backstab damage. This is a big deal for me, because I tank in a lot of games and most survival open world crafting games don't have this ability.

Skill Tree!!!
Wanna be a tank? Wanna be a rogue? Wanna be a battle mage? Wanna be all 3? You can go down twelve skill trees and mix and match grabbing fun things from other trees pretty easily. Respecing is low cost so you can experiment or change for quick role swaps easily. This feature really makes the game FUN!

Craftspeople
You find 5 ""craftspeople"" (aka npc's) that you place in your base as a new take on crafting benches.
They are new and different because they give quests to go get <crafting bench upgrade pieces like a table saw for example>
They have requests about how they want to live, like, hey, give me a roof would ya? Which is a nice personification of the crafting station, makes you want to invest in your base.
For example, we got the alchemist, and thought whoah lets make a really great looking alchemy workshop for this guy and went ham for a few hours really building a nice area for him. Now we scavenge books like crazy to put on his bookshelfs.
It makes investment in the building system into a nice cycle as you unlock more and more furniture, block types etc.

Differences from other games of its type:
- Skipping the night doesn't require all players to sleep. One player sleeping increases night speed by 30x (differs with number of players on) and that stacks.
- Gliders replace any need for a mount.
- You may place down a flame shrine to teleport to and from it. More placeable at a time as you upgrade the flame shrine level at your base.
- Sticky flair arrows for night time gives options for leaving a torch off your hotbar. Also firefly potions.
- Crafting from containers is reinforced by lore, as you have boring normal containers, but you can imbue them with magic to make crafting from containers ""wirelessly"" from all npcs or workbenches.
- Screw up while building or mining? Hit the 'Y' key to undo!
- Don't have the key to the door? OH well, just mine through the wall. No one has time for annoying back tracking.
- Friends who don't have time to no life it? Have them login, afk, and all xp gained gets partially given to them no matter how far away the kill is.

Just a few things. I'll update as I go.

My experience is from 2 (most of time) to up to 6 total players on our server. You can have up to 16* though.

This game has every bit of good from every great game you can think of -

The exploration in this game can be compared to Skyrim or any big open-world RPG where there are so many POIs to stumble upon on. Minimal ""empty spaces"" in between areas of interest. You can explore as you wish or follow the quests to progress.

The skill system is a basic version of Path of Exile's skill tree. There are different play styles to invest on - from being a ranger, a melee tank, or a mage. Even a mix of some play styles are possible.

Progression is balanced and respects your time (never mind the hours you'll spend playing this game). You won't have the need to grind your levels and the materials to progress your world level. There is a bit of power creep in terms of getting new gear. Be ready to drop legendary gear in exchange for common higher level gear as you progress. I am 50 hours and my friends and I have only explored about 1/3 of the current map. The current map is also not complete and will be 3 times bigger at full release.

Combat is engaging and fun. The combat system is a similar experience to dark souls combat. There is parrying, though not 1-to-1 copy from dark souls, also a bit easier. All combat styles are fun and balanced in their own way. I play a ranger with bows that can deal huge damage from afar but very squishy. Other combat styles are also very viable from what I've seen.

The building system is the best out of any building survival game I've ever played. The building system is voxel-based so you can finely craft and/or sculpt any builds you create. You can have it as detailed or as simple as you want. It's minecraft + valheim building combined. This trumps any base building games I've tried and I've played a lot.

The NPCs are nice and fun to interact with - they are basically one of your crafting stations and cater to different needs. You can RP a bit and build houses or areas of their own in your base. They have their own quest lines that will  unlock more recipes and items for you as you progress through the world.

The story telling is not the best and can be once again compared to dark souls. You will find bits of lore everywhere while exploring or while doing the quests for the NPCs. You will have to piece it together yourself in order to have a deeper understanding of this world.

Graphics are beautiful. The lighting is very atmospheric. Could use a weather system to further increase immersion. Needs a bit more optimization to make it run beautifully on your PC.

The UI is basic and not at all distracting. It can be better, but as is this early access, I hope they add more QOL stuff and settings in the UI.

There are many bugs such as the 60Hz refresh rate lock bug and other small things regarding dedicated servers. The devs are working hard in addressing these concerns and already released multiple hotfixes to alleviate the issues. Looking forward to the promised roadmap.

Solid 9/10 game. Excellent for an early access game. Tons of potential. Easily hundreds hours of content. Buy it now even if you're busy playing Palword as this game will only get better and more expensive at release.

After you learn the game mechanics it's going smoothly. Base building is excellent with lots of building materials and lots of options to build. And the fact that you can build your base almost everywhere, even dig a hole in the mountain or ground and make a base there if you want makes it even better. Possibilities are endless.

Graphics and overall performance of the game is very good too, I never had any problems. 

Bosses could be a bit harder to kill but it is how it is.
Map is fairly large with lots of POI's and quests. (and this is only 1/3 of the total map that is planned)
I think weapons and magic items should be reworked especially wands because they are too OP.
Skill tree is OK too, you can build your character how you want and it's very easy to reset the points and create new build in minutes. I tried all 3 main builds and I can say that I like high/damage tank the most, than Archer/assassin is second and then mage build is last, and that's mainly because you need to craft your own spells to shoot and it takes a lot of mana to use staff's. 

In the end this game hits the spot in the genre with innovative world design, excellent base building system and good fight system with lots of weapons, armor and magic items to find and craft, and with leveling and skill tree build ups there is a lot to do here.

My rating 7.5/10

I played melee at first, grabbed Merciless Strike and it feels so disjointed from combat. I have to stop attacking, wait a half sec for the button prompt, and hope my crosshair isn't pointed near a grapple point or body. Too many times I've gone in for a strike and grapple away and miss my window or open a loot window. Jump attack is has a long after animation that usually ended up getting me killed so I stopped using it outside of bugs, low levels or smashing furniture around me in buildings. 

I tried ranger second but found I was going through arrows way too fast. They don't feel like they have much impact on enemies closer to your level. I wish headshots would do much more damage. Sniping that headshot from another building should feel satisfying but it often led to enemies swarming towards me. Stealth headshot should be a critical+backstab damage to have a chance at staying in stealth. 

Magic feels weird and broken. Way too overpowered to nuke a room with one spell, yet get to a boss and that same spell only knocks off like 8% health. Meanwhile I'm just chugging back mana potions because I'm empty after 4 casts.

Loot needs an overhaul, I found a lvl 25 sword at like lvl 12 and didn't use anything for the rest of my play. 95% of the loot I found was lower level and immediately salvaged. There needs to be cosmetic choices too. Have a slot for functional stats, and a slot for cosmetics. I liked the look of a lot of the lower level armours and weapons but was forced into the appearance of the high level stuff. I'd also like the ability to collect clutter from the game. Plates, bowls, candles, nightstands, beds, etc. I want to pick up like everything to decorate my place. 

Base building needs something to defend against. Periodic raids could be fun. Of course have the option to turn it off because it's not what everyone wants. Fortifying I believe could add another dimension to base building. Base building is absolutely the best out of any game I've played. The voxel based placement is excellent, although some physics would be appreciated. you can make floating houses and structures which kind of kill the realism of building. 

Overall though, I enjoyed my time spent so far and I look forward to what's coming!

I would also recommend, since it is a crafting game, some more customization with weapons(add fire dmg you have to find X of something etc etc). Same with Armor.

Maybe add something like Vahlheim and have random mobs attack your base so you feel more obligated to build walls...

I've played for ~17hrs or so as of writing this review. Overall, the general gameplay loop is fun. You setup a base, rescue characters that increase your technology and crafting abilities and you adventure through the world delving through dungeons with light puzzle elements and fight some baddies and bosses along the way. 

I enjoy the combat. Its soulslike in the way its crafted. I.e lock on system, stamina management, dodge-rolling, etc. It's not perfect, sometimes the combos for melee weapons aren't as responsive as I would like. If I press the mouse a few times to do a combo, if I don't space the time between clicks properly then it will not perform the combo; however, this is an extremely minor complaint and doesn't really contribute to any negative experiences throughout the game. Other than that combat is fluid. Locking on feels nice, so does dodging. You of course have buffs you can apply to your character in the form of different foods such as i.e Health regen, endurance buff, stamina regen, mana, etc. Overall, combat is nice. 

Exploration is good, I like the design of the locations, The world is interesting with valleys being enveloped in ""Shroud"" a destructive fog that as you explore further throughout the map gets even more dangerous, some of these areas you have to improve your overall base before you can explore them. The glider is nice, though its a bit buggy. I've been able to duplicate a glitch where I essentially glide on the ground, sliding across the terrain quickly. I'm sure this will be patched in the future. 

Building is most likely one of the biggest reasons people will pick up Enshrouded. Lets be honest, it's a really good building system. You are granted SO many different options regarding foundations, walls, windows, ceilings, etc. You can detail your builds as much as you want with individual voxels you can place making the potential for grand builds and creative ideas absolutely remarkable. There's a few issues. You can't really rotate foundations it seems so they always face in one general direction. this is quite annoying as it makes it difficult to build anything that follows the terrain like a in-mountain base. But this can be added as I realize this is an Early access game. 

In general, I give it a solid 8/10 as of now. Great potential for future growth. 

TLDR: 
- Great building
- Soulslike Combat done well
- Exploration is cool but buggy sometimes",1707331899,1707331899,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I've spent 100 hours in this game and I regret nothing. I got this bad boy for $30 and am having more fun building and exploring than I have in many AAA games lately. 

[h2] Review: 8/10 [/h2]


[h3]Quests[/h3]

Enshrouded plays like many other survival games of the genre with the added fun of voxels. It's fairly similar to Valheim but graphically in a league of it's own. There are quests in the game for the NPC's you unlock, but they are pretty generic Fetch/Clear/Kill quests. I'd love to see more added and some variety, but the fact they even exist at all is fantastic! 

[h3] Leveling & Skills [/h3]

The game has a bit of an RPG sprinkled throughout it, and it's not a bad thing. Max level in Early Access is 25 and that might be low, but it's taking a while to get there. Currently I am 21 but honestly the fact you can farm skill points from shroud roots means you don't have to power level to get a certain trait. The skill tree and to be fair, even the map, need to be zoomed out. I'm not a fan of dragging my screen around to see everything. Those two menus look like they belong in a mobile game, please change that.

[h3] Graphics & UI [/h3]

The skill tree and map need to be zoomed out. Otherwise the UI is fairly clean, this isn't the most graphics focused game, but admittedly it does look really good. But for all the beauty of the scenery there is absolutely 100% no water. At all. No rain, no rivers, no streams, or waterfalls to chase. Hopefully that gets added soon, my castle needs a moat.

[h3] Building [/h3]

The building in Enshrouded is so friggin good. If there were triangle pieces or the ability to make fine tuned rotations it would be S-tier, I mean as is it is right now it's already pretty damn close. 90% of my game time is building, the other 10 is looking for all the blocks to build with. 

[h3] World Resets [/h3]

I know a lot of people hate that the world resets on restart, but I have no opinion one way or the other. 

[h3] Bugs [/h3]

This is an Early Access game so bugs are bound to exist, but I have yet to experience anything game breaking. I never experienced the rake bug but I read in the patch notes that's already been fixed. If you're worried about something preventing you from experiencing the fun that is in this game, don't worry the devs seem to be actively listening to the community and that in itself is refreshing.",1707331111,1707331140,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

the game changes it's priority in the task manager to normal and below normal constantly throughout the in-game day/night cycles. I have yet to know of a game that player's want to have set yto ""below normal"" priority on the computer while playing. not sure what this is a good idea for a ""voxel"" style game.

the most annoying is that the game, after you load into a world after selecting your character, is constantly ""compiling shaders"" (shown above latency of the in-game ESC men) and the game does properly and successfuly compile these shaders but for some reason, once you close the game (by normal intended methods or by crashing) are auto-removed and thus have to be compiled again ""only"" after you load into a world. (this is unrelated to the initial ""preprocessing"" step when first starting the game.

when asking around for 2 days (been having issues for 3 days straight trying to resolve) people have tried to help but ultimately disappeared with no resolution. meaning, the community don't have a clue. I believe the devs are the only ones capable of solving 2 issues i mentioned above so I just need to wait.

sucks when trying to get assistance and posting logs and screenshots when asked and getting dropped from assistance from the community (specifically the shaders problem that nothing has solved, not even the suggested solutions and beyond)

Note: no devs were involved in anything mentioned. support is pretty much community driven which i respect.
also, despite this being released recently, the issues I mentioned also existed in the demo which it's date goes back into last year.

Again, I expect these to be resolved at some point. this is explaining why I can't tell anyone to jump on the hype of this game as the game does degrade more and more in performance and functionality the more content you reveal in your worlds and early on, you may not experience all the possible performance problems until you reveal more of your world.",1707329953,1707329953,False,1,0,0.503037452697753906,0,True,False,True

I'm not much of a base builder in survival games however, this game provides so many options that I find myself focusing the base for more than just min/max efficiency. 
Skill tree lends itself to a lot of cross skills to that work well in many combinations. 
Looking forward to exploring more of the map as we get closer to release as well as a story ""big bad"", if one will exist. Like with many survival games, its more ""about the journey rather than the destination"", though this experience lends itself to a pseudo culmination with global (server wide) effects... or at least it would be very rewarding to have the story affect the map in ways that does not prevent continued exploration and play ability...

The gameplay is also pretty smooth with combat being fun and engaging and crafting a nice mix of hand crafting, NPCs, workstations and add-ons.

Overall the game is inspired by and taking the best of games like Valheim, V Rising, ARK and Conan Exiles, Breath of the Wild and Path of Exile including things like combat, base building, skill tree, flying around, crafting and farming.

But it also adds more than enough of its own flavour to be a distinct and enjoyable game of its own. A few examples:

It is great how pages/books with Lore point to new areas which often have a new page/book which points to a next location, etc. Also I like that the text of the lore helps in finding where exactly the page/book or the related chest is.

Also I really love the Shroud areas and the lore behind it kind makes sense. It's always exciting when one has to go into it.

Last but not least the puzzles in for example the Sun Temples add some variety to the game. More of those please :)

It can still be improved in a few areas:

Farming becomes tiresome pretty quickly because you have to plant each individual plant one by one. After a few hundred plants it becomes really tiresome to find the right spot for a plant. Perhaps add tools that can be unlocked later in progression that allows you to plant multiple plants in a grid at the same time.

The red fungus ground (pretty much lava) that quickly (e.g. within 2 seconds) drains your Shroud resistance while on it's own is great idea can also be really really annoying. Especially combined with that the game sometimes randomly has you sliding of edges or not-that-steep slopes. It's responsible for most of my deaths and those typically didn't feel fair.

Crafting arrows is a chore. You have to spend as much time farming twigs as you are shooting arrows in combat.

Personal Thoughts:
In its current state, this game has every chance to be one of, if not the best solo survival game ever, however as a multiplayer game there are clear issues.
Since the first big patch the game has begun crashing randomly which is seriously annoying, especially after ""Keen"" released a heavily detailed patch the following Monday, which I was very happy about...and it still crashed...
Yes my GPU is up to date.
Yes my system is more powerful that the recommended build.
No, I have no idea why it still randomly crashes, but ""Keen"" are sending out patches nearly everyday so hopefully the issue will be resolved with time and a little patience, this is after all still Early Access.
Building is really fun and simple, one of the best build engines I've ever used in a survival game. Bit limited on build shapes at the moment, but a huge amount of different materials to use, from basic stone and wood to luminous blocks and even bones. With just a little imagination you can construct some really cool, fun stuff.

Multiplayer Thoughts:
Well here is the problem in my opinion, there is no character individuality, what I mean by that is, all quests and loot boxes are attached to the world rather than to each player. So if you start a world with a friend, lets say its their server and you need to leave for a while or they play the next day while you are at work, any quests they complete are just complete, when you get back on they will simply be crossed off your list meaning you just miss out on dong them.
Quests, loot, everything needs to be attached to each player, allowing them to run the quests as and when they have time to play, so they don't miss out on anything and given the way this game works it wouldn't effect game play for others on the server.
Now apart from the fact that making this change to the game would NOT be a small undertaking, the only issue as far as game play is concerned I can actually think of, is the Flame Alter. If one person upgrades its level and base build zone size, should it upgrade for everyone? Well...no, it shouldn't.
One person upgrading the Flame Alter means they can drag their friends though shrouded and higher level areas they shouldn't even be in yet, but, if everyone has to do it individually, not only will it stop people ""cheesing"" their way through, but will also stretch the game play time out a little AND give the player something to work towards and achieve.

So, do I recommend Enshrouded?
Yes.
Great Early Access game for the price!
Loads of potential as well areas of the map still locked (for now) so definitely more to look forward to.
Regular patched and updates from ""Keen"" which for me proves they genuinely care about their game.
Multiplayer needs work but hey, still better than ""No Man's Sky"" was XD

It seems like they’ve really struck the perfect balance between over complexity with grind and not enough complexity and simple. The approach they take for crafting is possibly better than any other survival game I’ve played (a lot of them). 
Also the combat is rewarding. Especially when you don’t have good gear. The basic enemy will kick your a❤️❤️.

- The combat is beyond boring. I went magic and it's all but useless. You need ammo for spells? why? when you have mana. All I have to do to fight 90% of all bad guys is just walk backwards/side to side and swing my wand. Nothing will hit me, they run up stop and swing, rinse and repeat, it's boring!
- The crafting system is very basic. There is like 5 core pickups you get that make majority of everything. They use crafting supplies as rewards way to often and it ruins wanting to do quests. You slog through a camp just to get 2 building blocks. Or a stack of fiber 
- The map tanks the frame rate when zoomed out. Making the fast travel system a slog because you need to scroll the map for way too long.
- The levelling system is bland and uninspired. You get 2 skill points which all but do nothing for you. A lot of the skills you can pick are 3+ points resulting in many levels to get anything. (I know spore roots give a skill point but its still very tedious)
- Amour feels like it is beyond useless and needs to be reworked badly. Same with the damage output on weapons. Level 5 enemies are still hitting for 80+ hit points, same as when I started the game.
- The building in this game is so close to being awesome but yet it's so dumb, you are limited to building only around your base you need to craft a certain item to build within in it. You cant come across an obstacle and build around it, or build a bridge to cross a river and so forth...
- And the bugs, the little beetle type bugs ... fuck them I hate them so much!!!! They are OP as shit and BEYOND annoying. Top 10 worst enemy in a game for me right now

The reasons I really like this game and want to keep playing it
- The world feels big and I want to explore it
- The voxel based building system could have so much potential... but alas you only need to build for the fast travel capabilities
- The terrain being formable is awesome and we don't see it enough in these types of games.

Loot is horrible and reminds me of Diablo. It's basically running to golden chests, you don't even have to fight enemies, just pray for legendary. You get five more levels and replace a legendary with white rusty sword. It's awful design.

It's a world where building, exploration, and yes, dying in absurdly creative ways, are all part of the experience. Much like the pioneering days of Valheim, Enshrouded offers a familiar yet distinct journey, though it's still on its way to reaching the zenith of the genre.

The game unfolds in Embervale, a sprawling fantasy world blanketed by the Shroud, a mystical fog harboring deadly threats. While the Shroud serves as a key feature, it's the lush landscapes and intricate details of Embervale that truly captivate. From ruins to villages, the world is teeming with unique points of interest, begging to be explored.

Yet, for all its allure, venturing into the Shroud feels like stumbling blindly into obscurity. The low visibility and time pressure detract from the otherwise immersive experience, making me yearn for the delights above the fog. Fortunately, Enshrouded offers plenty beyond the Shroud to keep adventurers hooked.

Building takes center stage in Enshrouded, and rightfully so. The construction system is a stroke of brilliance, offering a seamless blend of premade shapes and customizable features. Crafting a Flame Altar and wielding a Construction Hammer, players can erect structures that rival even the grandest of designs. The rustic aesthetics of building materials add to the charm, while the hunt for new recipes adds a layer of excitement to exploration.

Quests serve as a guiding hand through the vast expanse of Embervale, leading players to unlock essential tools and awaken fellow survivors from their slumber. Combat, reminiscent of Valheim, offers a challenging yet satisfying experience, though the variety in weapons feels lacking in flair.

Enshrouded is a mixed bag of delights and frustrations, where every innovative feature is offset by a glaring oversight. Despite its flaws, the game holds promise as a future titan of the genre. Playing solo can feel lonely at times, but with friends, Enshrouded becomes a playground of endless possibilities.

Technical issues mar the experience, but they're forgivable in the context of early access. With time and refinement, Enshrouded could evolve into a polished gem worthy of widespread acclaim.

Enshrouded is a journey worth embarking on, despite its early stumbling blocks. With its exquisite building mechanics, evocative world, and potential for greatness, it stands as a testament to the boundless creativity of its developers. So gather your courage, brave the mist, and uncover the mysteries of Embervale in Enshrouded. And who knows, you might just find yourself addicted, like me, and even draw your friends into its captivating embrace, as I did. My friend, who I encouraged to play, is now even higher level than me, a testament to the game's captivating allure and endless potential for adventure.",1707326461,1707326531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Dig the recipe/crafting/discovery system. Overall product needs lots of polish but that's to be expected (Early Access).

Took me a bit to finagle with controller setup, but finally have my dualshock performing well.

Atmosphere is good and some of the crafting/building looks unbelievable. I like how food is handled as buff/go-time specific instead of just a tired game-loop for the player. to constantly manage everyone's hunger. 

Cheers to devs who respect the players time (also all gear is repairable, even broken stuff). Ain't nobody got time for bygone grinds lol.

Overall I liked the story and the various tidbits of lore spread throughout the world. for this adds a lot to the game in addition to a nice skill system which is rather simple but makes it fun to experiment with different builds.

Exploration and story are the main driving forces for me in this game and it seems there will be a lot more to come. base building is decent but unlike Valheim didn't grip me the same way, it's good just not the main thing for me here.

Collecting resources is rather straightforward and can be done in a couple of way through directly gathering the resources or finding them in the world by breaking anything and everything you come across.
I do wish that chopping trees and messing with mining would be more Valheim like as I feel that game managed to make those aspects really fun.
Combat is decent enough though the boss battles and AI for enemies in general leaves a lot to be desired for.

I like the visual style but again, can't help comparing to Valheim, didn't feel as unique or engaging as that.
Music and sounds are also serviceable but nothing unique and requires further work which I'm sure they will.

People who claim they don't like time limits...really, play the game, the shroud timer is a lot of time, you have easy potions to boost it, class abilities to boost it, and can typically just run out or find a high spot or kill a nearby root.

It feels like a well developed game; The mechanics come together very well, both in terms of overall gameplay, the fighting, the building and the AI. The world feels ""populated"".
Then the fact that you have such nuanced options when it comes to build your characters class.
I haven't dived too deep into the storyline of the game, but the parts I did read felt well written and came together to tell an engaging story with room for both drama, humor and tragedy.

So all in all Keen Games really pulled off a success here IMO. Now just really looking forward to seeing how they populated the last half of the map and what the further long terms plans are.

I havent been rushing the game, so I'm not completely through it yet, but right now I'm just enjoying terraforming and building my advanced base. At the moment I can easily see myself starting over and choosing another class and try out other ways of shaping my own base.

__Time and Replay value__
- It has a good amount of gameplay time. I completed the game and all of the achievements solo, without rushing, in about 76 hours.
- It has moderate replay value.  I can see myself going back and playing through it again, either as a different class skillset, or with a group.  I doubt I would play it more than that though.  Unlike Valheim, the map is crafted, and does not change, which means the exploration aspect is lost after the first time.

--Building and Farming__
- The game has a good farming mechanic.  The range of things you can eventually grow are very varied, so whether you are growing them for food or resources, or for the look, there is a lot there. 
- The building is both varied, but also somewhat annoying.  You find a great deal of different building styles through exploration and quests.  The downside is that the building itself is a little more annoying in terms of being able to place things, and there is no way to place walls or items on a diagonal, which means everything turns out a bit boxy. 
- The ability to terraform with the hammer is pretty good.  The ability to terraform with the rake is horrific (or at least that is my experience of it).

__Exploration__
- Exploration is really good in the game.  Because the world is crafted, the towns really feel quite natural when you come across them.  There are lots of little hidden things around, like lore, chests, building materials, etc, so it keeps it very interesting.  The exploration was one of the best things in the game.
- I have to mention the gliding, as part of the exploration.  It is just really excellent as a mechanic, and often I would be mining myself up cliffs in order to get to a good vantage point to leap off.

__Combat__
- I don't have too much to say about the combat.  I wouldn't say that it is difficult though.  There are mini bosses in certain areas, and enemies will hit progressively harder as time goes on, but even I, who am not great with combat, managed fine in it.  The game is really very forgiving.  
- Speaking of forgiving, players can make all wild animals neutral towards them, as well as another type of mob later in the game if they spend points in the Beastmaster tree.  It takes a lot of the difficulty out of the later game, but at the same time it is optional and people who are primarily there for exploration and building will like it.

So overall I would say the game is worth your money if you are looking for an exploration game that isn't too punishing.",1707315286,1707315286,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

COMBAT - feels very weird staffs are just long to use that require items - wands are just good for picking off higher hp enemies in boring long fights - close up combat sword/shield camera gets to close up and fighting multiple enemies quickly become confusing as you can not zoom out more of your field of view even when maxed out in settings.

EXPLORATION - it was so fun at first discovering travelling but it quickly becomes obvious its literally all copied and pasted as and its not like there is a ton of different POI i can probably name them on one hand - farm / small village /  camp / run down building-- i literally knew what to expect at every poi within a couple of hours of gameplay.

TREASURE / LOOT  wow does this game make it so damn boring to find new stuff everything you find unless your lucky enough to get something of a random camp boss is so BORING common loot here there and everywhere , open a chest with a key guess what yep its a common wand or something you have already found 20 times. it seems all you find is 1 of 4 types of crappy weapon with the same boring stats and that's the reward for finding most of the new Places of interests a few mobs and some crappy chests oh and lets not forget notes to point you into the direction of the next copy and paste POI.

ENEMIES- i was so bored after fighting the same enemies continuously after 12 hours I can also still count the different variants on my one hand.

BASE BUILDING - yeah its pretty good but for a solo player as myself I have no need to build anything other than the starting base and you only need one base and travel between fires i have no one to show off my base too i cam for the exploration and adventure as a solo player. 

SKILLS / ATTRIBUTES -- lacking depth and rewarding mechanics i didn't find making sure having the correct build was even that important and as long as i had health and stamina levelling up did not interest me that much and grinding interested me even less on this game.

NPC INTERACTIONS - other than saving the npc's you need for building and crafting you save from the sleeping pods and summoning with a staff in your base to stay still and just tell you something boring here and there there is 0 npc's to interact with in the exploration from my time playing 

I GENUINELY couldn't even force myself to carry on playing it. it just felt empty and lonely and the copy and paste aspect with lack of reward for exploring and lack of variants in character builds and enjoyable weapons were so off putting. not even a npc to speak to while exploring here and there to do some kind of silly quest with interesting dialog this game needs A LOT of content.

So lets get started with the good things. 

Its massive, the world is extremely large and according to the full map size we only have access to ~1/3rd of it right now. Its terrain/building system while it does need some polishing, it is really good compared to other survival games. In terms of a survival game its go a lot going for it and with some polishing it could be extremely great. It also has no hunger bar which I absolutely love and instead opts to use food to give you buffs which is super cool and unique way of doing it. 

Now the bad.

Its combat is horrible; its extremely clunky and hit registration is some of the worst ive ever seen (Ping ~ 40-50). Ontop of that some monsters hit extremely hard, which having hard hitting unique foes isnt bad on the surface except they have the exact same drop table as the weaker ones. Not to mention they move FAST so if you enjoy casting or being a wizard you are going to have a rough time. Over all the damage just doesn't seem balanced at all and what makes it weirder is that in their first patch notes instead of fixing bugs, glitches and problems (which they did do some) they also over nerfed healing showing the dev may be inclined to do balance changes without testing or optimization. 

Off of combat, their stamina system is by far the worst ive ever seen and I already hate stamina systems as is. But it charges extremely slowly. Now their game design is you build up your guage to have alot and build stamina regen with armor, rested, and buffs; however, it just shouldn't exist. It makes the early/beginning just feel absolutely horrible as you get 10 strikes in a tree then AFK waiting for it to recharge for the next minute, but it makes the mid/end game tedious. 

This game also has alot of exploration and verticality to it, but lacks climbing which was an extremely weird design choice, but I wont fault them for it as its just a design choice. 

There is also a big problem with their limitation on server control. There is no settings outside of connection stuff like IP, ports, names and passwords. And to branch off that actual client control. No brightness control or other key features that need to be in settings. The game is way to dark at night time like im sorry devs but if IRL is that dark for you you got issues with your eyes. But also bloom/day time is way to bright. I get light based headaches and after enough light it could even turn into a migraine, and this game like flashbangs you anytime you step outside. 

Also craft timers. The games craft timers are way to long. It needs to honestly needs to be halved or even third. 

And finally the quest system is just kinda bad. Alot of quests dont have indicators for it to show where to go, which wouldn't be 100% bad if it wasn't for the fact you can get the quest from a random note on the road and not even realize it until you get back to base and then you are just kinda screwed because you cant follows its clues and you have no idea where you got it from. 

Now I didnt know where to put this in terms of good or bad but its player system. It does something really interesting where the character itself isnt locked to one world so you have a kind of universal level to progress regardless of the world. Which is unique and interesting and honestly I really like; however, a big problem comes in the fact that its gear and inventory also transfer. So if makes it kind of useless because if you wanted to play with a friend you would have to remember to leave all your stuff on one world before going to theirs. And then you are still super over leveled for the start of the game so you are just going to end up carrying your friend. I think the system is really cool but needs alot of attunement. 

Overall I was able to squeeze ~70 hours out of the game and get a majority of the stuff done. As of posting this all I have left is collecting all the flame shrines, which since there is no real reward besides and achievement for doing it (sparks become useless after flame level 6) I probably wont end up doing it. It does have alot of promise and I am sure in a year or so the game will be in a really good state; however, right now it is honestly just disappointing.",1707310914,1707311850,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This has strong Valheim vibes for me, a game that I really liked, but I find Enshrouded to be superior in almost every way. The graphics look better, the animation is smoother, the game play more engaging, and the combat more fun. It's missing the water and boats, but I think it more than makes up for that with the glider and grappling hook mechanics.

- the combat is REALLLY good compared to other survival games
- Path of Exile-lite skill tree that gives you meaningful abilities is really cool
