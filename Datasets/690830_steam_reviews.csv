There is no help/options to see how goods are being handled (statistcs ect.) But yea.... you get plenty of time to figure it out were stuff went wrong. because yea, no challenge.

I would rate it 50/50. But they want to throw it out of EA to soon. There are still some key fixes before having a full consistent game.

You can view your refund request at help.steampowered.com

Requests are considered on a case by case basis and are not typically issued for purchases of released products that are more than 14 days old, or if the purchased product has more than 2 hours of playtime. For in-game items the refund period is 48 hours and the item must not have been consumed, modified, or transferred.

So no money back for me even though I never played the game.
So buyer beware if it doesn't work for you request your money back within the allotted time or you will be out of pocket like me.

Not even monuments, just the regular Manors building, or whatever it's called. The UI is the worst i have ever seen in any game. You're supposed to assign different functions to seperate parts of the building, but it's fucking impossible, In 30 years of gaming i have never seen any UI that's worse than this. You shouldn't need to google for a manual simply on how to build a stupid building. The UI would have to do that by itself. I wanted to play this game again, now that it received some updates. But with this horrendous UI, i won't play it ever again. Too bad i can't refund it after such a long time.

Like other games in this genre, it does tend to fizzle out toward the endgame. Once you've built everything there is to build, there doesn't seem to be much reason to keep playing unless you're really interested in earning achievements.

One I haven't found the answer to is how to attach a weather vane or chimney to the Manor House.  I've moved it to every place I can think of on the Manor House without success.

Edit: For example, I have built Monastery building such as the Apiary, Vineyard, etc and cannot get my Brothers assigned to them.  It is supposed to be automatic.

You designate residential areas, and build workplaces, but villagers decide where to build their houses and what routes to travel.  Over time, these are worn into roads and villagers will continue to follow an existing road over an unblazed trail.  I really appreciate the more natural look this gives a town, over similar more grid-based games like Banished or the Anno series.

It's improved quite a bit in the past three years since I originally picked up the game.  Many gameplay and QoL improvements, an improved UI, and other features have been added.  It also has extensive mod support, and many modders have picked up the mantle, deepening the game experience considerably.  There are new decorative models, production chain expansions, and system overhauls.  Literally hundreds of mods and maps to date, and it's not even in full release.

One thing some players may not like is the lack of ""tension"" in the game.  It does not have much of a survival aspect, or much in the way of disasters or setbacks.  The biggest concern is keeping your people fed and meeting their other needs to keep them happy and prevent them from leaving your fief.  There is no real strategic military aspect either, no crises to defend, just a mission system where you train soldiers and receive rewards when they are victorious.

after 360 hours of play, I think I can give a constructive opinion:
At first, the game seems complicated to understand but is ultimately very simple and easy to understand when you have the basics.
The game is very well developed with almost no bugs.
It deserves to be much better known than it is currently, however, the game is made for an audience that already knows the basics of games like this!

Personal opinion :
I find that the money system is quite limited in the exchanges between the cities, which, the last time I played it, was the same regardless of the games, it would be a plus if the trades were random depending on the parts.
The war system is also not developed enough, yet in medieval times, war was important so I think an update or improvement could be positive!
I also find that the game is not present enough on social networks, it's a shame it has a lot of potential and I'm sure that lots of people would be very interested

Here are the positives :

- Very calm game
- Good Music
- Very good graphics
- Magnificent map
- The UIs are easy to understand
- Does not take up much storage space
- Does not take much performance
- Non-existent bugs
- Some features are incredible and never seen before in another game

And the Negative Points:
- Complex economy and can be hard to understand at first
- Some features are not advanced enough
- Becomes too complex at a certain level of play
 
If you have played city skyline, this game is certainly of another style, but you will like it just as much, I can even say that for some, you will probably like Foundation more than CS

As someone who thoroughly enjoys city-building experiences, this game exceeded my expectations in every way.

Pros:

Aesthetic Splendor: Foundation transports you to a visually stunning medieval world. The attention to detail in the architecture, landscapes, and ambient sounds immerses you completely. Every structure feels like a piece of art, contributing to the overall grandeur of your growing settlement.

Intuitive Building Mechanics: The building mechanics are a joy to work with. The intuitive interface and user-friendly controls make constructing your medieval dream city a seamless and enjoyable process. From intricate road layouts to majestic castles, the possibilities are endless.

Deep Economic Simulation: Foundation doesn't just stop at aesthetics; it delves into the complexities of a medieval economy. Balancing resources, managing production chains, and satisfying the needs of your citizens add layers of depth that keep you engaged for hours.

Modding Support: The game's commitment to modding support enhances its longevity. The community-created content expands the already vast possibilities, ensuring that your medieval world can continuously evolve.

Cons:

Learning Curve: Foundation may present a bit of a learning curve for newcomers to the city-building genre. While the tutorials are helpful, some players might find themselves initially overwhelmed by the intricacies of resource management and city planning.

Performance Optimisation: On larger cities or intricate designs, the game may experience slight performance issues. While not a dealbreaker, further optimisation could enhance the overall experience. (This is expected in early access)

In a Nutshell:

Foundation is more than a game; it's a journey back in time to the medieval era, where your imagination is the only limit to what you can build. With its breathtaking visuals, intuitive mechanics, and a deep economic simulation, it stands as a testament to the excellence achievable in city-building games. Despite a mild learning curve and occasional performance hiccups, Foundation is a must-play for enthusiasts of the genre, promising countless hours of medieval architectural bliss.",1695947720,1704443912,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

My Review:
In my opinion it’s one of the best settlement games out there. It does a lot stuff different as other games though, took a bit reading to get into it, but it’s all easy explained with a guide in-game. 

The landscape looks pretty simple at begin, but the more you build the more shiny it becomes. Villagers build their own houses in a chosen area and later upgrade them. The detail of the building process is pretty neat. I really was like wow wow wow as i played my first two hours of the game, just impressed how many cute details this game offers.

A little issue i had:
Tried to stream it on discord but the game just did not want to let me tab out with my windows key, so had to use a work around with opening the taskmanger.

But seriously, look at all the playtime from those positive reviews - that speaks for itself.

The player is not forced to lay out the road map because the villagers' pathing creates the road network. 

The primary buildings (tavern, monastery, manor, and fort) are modular and thus unique in every build based on your city's specific needs. 

The beautification process is set to a low bar for those who don't want to engage, but there is more than enough capacity for those who want to dive in and truly make it THEIR city. You can even rename every villager and building.

Combat is non-existent, which was a good choice given the meticulous city design and layout. If armies kept waltzing through your lands, it would necessitate alignment with the military faction. That would have sweeping implications across the game. To gain access to a constant flow of certain materials, you would be forced to play a balanced game across all factions to survive.

It's still not without its fair share of jank, but most of the rough corners have been smoothed and now it's more endearing rather than anything. 

The only mechanic I don't fully enjoy is conflicting allegiances (kingdom, labor, clergy). I dont think it adds much and feels very artificial. In the end you just end up building rows rows of armories to get that kingdom allegiance into positive, so it's an easily circumvented annoyance.

It is not an issue that development takes long. It's how they changed their roadmap and abandoned majority of the most interesting features that would really set this game apart from the ocean of builder strategy games. There are early access games that turn out good, better or worse than promised. This one definitely falls into the category of worse than promised and with no chance of this game getting what was promised - I do not recommend it. 

I still play it from time to time only to see redundant new features and UI overhauls added that are a mixed bag, no new features, no children and aging mechanics, no meaningful global events, no seasons, no weather except rain once upon a time, no meaningful NPCs and the best part - it's never coming. Just you closed in a dead box where you get to build your town with robotic villagers that do not really live life, or, more precisely - fail to deliver the immersion of actually living their lives. After some hours, every new run you start just feels like a dead, pointless exercise of placing the same optimal designs to make your town run. Now as a bonus - made worse to get a grasp of this for new players with horrendous beautification UI update. Why fix something that never needed fixing, right? Well these devs go the other way it seems.

I like how the developers thought that adding more buildings and dressing up these robotic creatures in different work apparel, in their minds, was supposed to fix this. Well it did not.

Buy this if you are in for a simple builder game with no tricks or really cool original features under its lid. If you are in for the building aspect and don't really focus on little details and your settlers - this might be the game for you. Once you figure out what this game is about in couple of runs, you'll rarely touch it again otherwise, because boy oh boy, is it lacking after all these years with devs who have zero interest in actually putting their game on its original track of promised features.",1702734673,1702734673,False,154,5,0.874042034149169922,6,True,False,True

It takes a little getting used to but is very rewarding when you settle in with the flow and works.

With around 20 hours so far in the game, progression system has felt well paced with unlocks and paths providing new professions and materials to be discovered growing the focus of your settlement depending on what you decide to branch into. Trade if opted into is simplified but provides enough encouragement for choosing a direction. The systems provided are not groundbreaking but greatly executed to provide what makes the game thrive. It's on the more relaxed side of gaming experiences with the lack of natural disasters and combat not really being a thing, where you instead send your retinues off to other regions off screen. 

Maps are generated with seeds and slider options, which while great for being available doesn't provide a lot of replay value at the current time as you will likely find yourself sticking to one playthrough. Another thing that can definitely be improved on is the UI experience as while modular tends to cluster the screen and drown out some of the more useful shortcuts combined with an unnecessary amount of clicks to get through options.

There's no stress in this game, it's not fast paced, you don't have to overthink to optimise your builds but you can allow yourself some thinking time to make it right.

Most buildings are pre-built but you can assemble your ""monuments"" yourself to give them a nice look.

Late mid-game brings some difficulties, not that much, but you have to rethink some places to avoid discontent in your citizens.

No deep micro-management but some management nonetheless so you won't be buried under numbers.

Be prepared to close 100 windows a minute, have to constantly go back and forth to toggle different views on and off, because rather than just show you beauty and undesirable housing when you're painting housing, you have to go and find that setting. When you're done you'll have to go back and turn it off. Super basic UI/UX stuff. 

Why can't you filter a list of 500+ villagers? Even just tabs for soldiers, clergy and workers would be a huge improvement. Please make this happen for both the book and the promote a villager page, both are infuriating to use.

Why can't I set hotkeys on my mouse buttons? Why can't the Mandates Page be set to a hotkey? It's like the game takes a perverse pleasure in giving your wrist RSI. Click, click, click.

How on earth do you resize a building? Many buildings say they support it, but no where in the controls does it tell me how.

How do you build a mine? How do you unlock mines? It won't show you anywhere in the game, not until you buy the territory that your prospector found on the other side of the map, click on the thing and start editing it, because apparently the rock is already a building.... You have to unlock fishing, but not mining... I spent so long trying to google this. Honestly the amount of times I googled stuff tells me how much of a mess this game is still.

You can drop buildings *on top of one another* and the game doesn't care until someone's access gets blocked later. Sometimes it doesn't even do that. Enjoy having 6 stonemasons on top of each other. 

You can have hundreds of food resources and people still complain about not enough food, but the game doesn't help you to understand how to fix this. Do you need to build 100+ market stalls? Granaries every 50m? 
I've had the monastery producing their own berries and monastic meals, surrounded by granaries full of berries and fish and them all complaining about being starving. Yes the refectory was set to serve them, and the markets all sold those foods. Heaven help them, literally. 

Having a resource set to stockpile will not always help you, you might have hundreds of units in the production centre, multiple granaries next to it full of workers, and still not be able to deliver 25 in time to complete a task, waiting for 28 days and not understanding why nothing was moving was painful.

Drop an archway to make a pathway more beautiful? Now the villagers are all going to intentionally walk around it, even if it makes their route longer.

Characters occasionally use doors, otherwise they will just walk through walls. Militia refuse to live in the barracks. Expect to see half of your buildings be buried in the ground.

When the game tells you an NPC has a problem, like they are missing a certain need, or can't find a house, you can click on the notification and it just takes you to the NPC and follows them, but doesn't automatically open anything about them. You don't know where they work or live. You have to figure out which tiny person it's talking about and then try to click on them. This is especially useless if the NPC in question is currently inside a building. Then you just have to do nothing until they decide to leave. Good luck figuring out where to put the market/house/tavern they need.

The games' budget panel is exceedingly useless. Your trend seems to include every piece of minor activity you've done. So it can tell you you're going to be making money on average this month and despite doing absolutely nothing, building nothing, accepting no new villagers, nothing, still lose money month on month. It's incredibly hard to figure out what the economy in this game wants you to do.

There's so many more things that were annoying but that's all I've got time for now. Hope the Devs read this, hope they do something about some of these issues. I've been following this game for a few years thanks to splattercat, and you'd honestly expect some of these issues to be fixed by now. Seriously, why can you build buildings on top of one another... It's not like they stack even when you're trying to make a tower. They just build inside one another. Please fix this mess.",1700783742,1700783742,False,32,1,0.6591530442237854,0,True,False,True

I recently came back to it semi-randomly (it popped up in a list of games that are good in this genre) and it changed a lot, for the better.

Something that is not very common in this game is that you have to make some choices in how you want to develop, with 3 possible directions.
Nothing completely blocks the rest but you progress much faster by focusing on one and much slower by going through all three at once.
It is harder to pickup the branch(es) you didn't pick later on but you usually have a lot more available to force your way through as well (since the basic tier unlocks of each doesn't require any progress in them).

Each branch is quite different, the ""labor"" focusing on trade and taxes, the ""kingdom"" being all about armies and wars and the ""church"" being about developping a monastry and other religious buildings.

The whole ""build your own stuff from parts"" that a decent amount of buildings use is also kind of fun to use, especially when you have enough resources to not care too much about ""wasting"" some.

I obviously have not gone all the way (played a lot more than the 5 hours it shows because my internet was down for a few days that were when I played) because it's still not out of early access and I don't want to feel burnt out before the devs finish it (which is likely to happen for once).",1699920695,1699920695,True,5,0,0.537866353988647461,0,True,False,True

Building anything is also horrendously tedious, with many simple actions like selecting/adjusting a building part taking at three to four clicks, which is pretty awful considering how much focus the game puts on custom-designed buildings. The selection of parts for most buildings is also extremely limited, so it becomes exceedingly challenging to construct the things you want, or even design unique constructions in the first place. The housing system is still deeply un-intuitive as well, and has the capacity to completely tank existing saves with no explanation to the user as to why.

I can now confidently say that this game is ready (and balanced). It is a beautiful, calming, INTRICATE citybuilder. Gameplay is on the faster side (as a slower player that presses pause a lot, I definitely do not feel the need to fast forward the game at all. 

---> PREVIOUS REVIEW
Fun. Challenging. Beautiful. Lovely music. Needs work in its current state and definitely not worth $30 when things are still broken.

Games like this are highly dependent on perfected balance of game mechanics. A farm over-produces wheat and there is no challenge to keeping villagers fed. Alternatively, farms produce a hair too little wheat, and the game becomes impossible. It's a finesse thing. 

Aside from the 10 tiny issues throughout the first evening of gameplay, the biggest challenge was that I was successful. I got there. I built a village and produced enough food and my workers were happy. Until one day they started starving. Bread stores: medium. Berry stores: high. But not a single loaf or bushel to be found in the storefronts. There was some bread and berries in the warehouses, though not enough to account for my entire inventory. The rest of it... mysteriously nowhere to be found in my village. My villages... starving. I watched, distraught, as happiness plummeted from 90s to 27. I built more markets, to no avail. I added more foragers, only to see my stores increase higher still, yet the starving villagers continued. At 27, I stress quit. And I'm not sure I'll be back. 

Balance your game mechanics. And give your players a little more coaching if things like proximity or layout truly matter enough to produce the result described above. Until then, don't charge anyone else $30. 

(Probably should not write a comment directly after stress quitting, but it is infuriating when you invest several meaningful hours of your own time into something beautiful that screws you over with no logical explanation.)",1550375010,1699729829,True,0,0,0.723544478416442871,14,True,False,True

It can kick in at any point, even during the tutorial section, and when it does there is nothing that can be done except quit and start over from scratch....the lumberjack stops cutting trees. The workers go to the workplace and then just stand there doing nothing. I thought that by building the lumber camp in the middle of a forest this would resolve it, but no, the lumberjack wont leave the camp to cut down trees that are right outside. According to posts online there is no limit to the range of the building so in theory they should be able to cut trees anywhere on the map (and the map is FULL of trees), so I guess they find the woods too scary for them to step foot outside of the camp.
As EVERY building requires wood to build the game is over at this point and whether you are just starting a new game or have a large established town it is sooooo annoying and frustrating to have wasted you time on planning and building just for this bug to ruin the game.

No news still on the roadmap and played a while to see where the game is at. It's very sad but they completely changed audience and ditched the rest of us.

Nothing has been done either to change most of the annoying things some of us complained since the start, like:
1- the way villagers go on straight lines to the top of mountains instead of zigzaging, (and lets remember that the main idea behind this game is how realistic they build roads)
2- houses seem to exist in a hidden layer where their positions are fixed, so you can have a perfect place for a house that will never be built because the shape doesn't match with this layer, but at the same time, some of those that do get built end up intersecting with each other so it makes little sense.
3- they got rid of the priest instead of adding it (it was there but unsuable for a long time)
3- at a very close level the animations lose too much detail and look very laggy so you can't play at a slow pace without it looking bad

It can be relaxing, but every now and then there are some events that can be frustrating.

So the game is the classic build your buildings and production chain fare with a few very original and nice tweaks.

The research is developed along with the faction relations. There are three factions (church, labor and king) and rising the favor and splendor (that's a resource) with one will lower the relations with the other two. There are some edicts which lower these dependencies. 

You can choose a path for building your village. For trading and luxury life it's church, for internal policies it's labor and for military and missions (that bring you money and resources) it's the king.

I like the most another original feature: modular buildings which are also monuments (I think that the tavern is also a monument :D) and they can take a lot of space for building them, but all the functional rooms and the spectacular architecture of the big buildings is a very fresh take in this kind of games. What I mean is that it's really a pleasure to plan the structures and build them cause they are very beautiful and also have functions (for example, in the monastery you can build an apiary and it's the only way to get honey and wax that bring you a lot of money in trading).

Furthermore, the upgradeable houses are built by people after you zone, like in Cities Skylines, some places for them. That makes for a very natural spreading of the village and the most beautiful landscapes in this kind of games.

Of course, like all things, this is not a perfect game. I have not encountered any bugs, but a particular negative event lasts so long that once I reloaded the game, thinking that it was a bug. Also several mechanics are not thoroughly explained and I had to google them.

But I think this is one of the top village building games, it's not at all boring and repetitive and it's a real pleasure to see your peeps going about their lives.

Pros:
- beautiful graphics and landscapes with a natural spreading of your village
- original implementation of research and trading
- not easy, but also not very hard
- modular buildings that also have functionality
- relaxing most of the time
- engaging and not repetitive
- random map generation very good
- in my top three village building games of all time

Cons:

On top of the proven concept of real-time settlement builder, Foundation adds depth in the form of interactions with different estates giving different boni early in the game, missions from other factions which can amount to anything from providing ressources to military aid, and some customizable buildings that get additional functions depending on the features added.

Things I'd like to mention that aren't that important, but add to at least my experience:
- Houses are built by settlers themselves if ressources are provided, which seems like a small thing, but building houses in most city-builders is more a chore than fun construction to me, as it amounts mostly to slapping one house next to the other until demand is met... Also, that self-building may lead to its own challenges to deal with as settlers might not use the available space in an optimized way and will draw upon your ressource stocks sometimes at situations you need them yourself.
- Buildings don't have fixed areas of service, workers will just go there and leave the place to find whatever they're extracting, which might be incredibly ineffective if walks are too long, so buildings aren't kinda fire-and-forget (into an area where there is the ressource) but need to be taken care of long after they have been built, which adds to my experience of building a settlement rather than an industry.
- More content is still coming, and it's been in the beta for a couple of years now.

Performance-wise two things stand out to me about the game:
1. The graphics, as expected from a game of this budget, are simple and a bit cartoony yet detailed and not clunky.
2. It works without any sort of grid - all buildings and entities seem to work vector based which imho is a wonderful feature, as it destroys the min-max mentality a grid will often push you towards.

AND DESPITE those two things mentioned above the game runs absolutely smoothly even on an absolute potato PC like my gf's that has lag issues with, say, SimCity4...
With that in mind, Foundation appears to me as one of the absolute top city-builders for low budget gamers.",1693465137,1697393467,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

All in all a lovely game, well worth a look if you enjoy city builders.

Previous Review:
I'm giving this a negative purely because I'm hoping the developer addresses the criticisms.  Other than that it appears to be a good game with a lot of promise.

At the time of writing I've got a reasonably functioning little village; good food production, wood and planks, a nice little church (and I love the modular nature of the churches, monasteries and manor houses) - but there's an issue.  My granary is stocked to the rafters, I have people willing to transport the goods to the market, the market is stocked to the rafters - and I have a couple of stalls willing to sell the food (again with people assigned to sell the food).  What went wrong?  Well I decided to try and build a roof over one of the stalls to increase its capacity - and even though all of the materials required are present my builders are sat in their house doing nothing.  I've got no other building projects going on whatsoever and in waiting for a single stall to get a roof cover my entire market has shut down.  Everyone is starving even though I have a mountain of meat and berries.  It's annoying that the builders are not picking up their job - but it's even more annoying that the entire market ceases to function when you add a stall to it (and makes me wonder what happens when things get more diverse).


There are a few other little quirks of early access but this bug to me is game breaking.  I remember reading something similar quite some time ago on a review and was hoping that such things would be ironed out but as it stands the game falls over just as it begins to really get going; otherwise I just feel bitten by early access...

Great city builder with a unique perspective on the need to keep certain factions happy with you (clergy, labor, kingdom) as well as the ability to build unique buildings like your tavern, manor, church, etc... how you want them. Early and mid game content is rich, but I think future improvements to this game (and they are still coming mind you) need to focus on mid and late game depth. To be clear, this game is top-notch as-is and worth the price. I played a year ago and came back and the updates were great! I think with future improvements my rating would go from 8's to 9's. 

I think the area this game lacks is in the mid-to-late game depth. For example, the ability to better manage food discontent: warehouses and granaries only have 4 spaces... should be able to upgrade this with stone+iron+tools. Similarly, the ability to create more diverse entertainment options. I think the game could branch out and provide some unique ability to give us entertainment buildings (fair ground, city square, playwright, musicians, animal entertainment, etc...) and it would add depth to the game while giving less food-focused requirements for villager promotion. As an example, the fair ground could be a monument build we are able to add to, and it can have a musician's stand, jousts, chess / cards booth, horse races, gambling, etc... Could also allow the monument for a feast hall on the manor to host feasts.",1696265011,1696265011,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

(Patch 1.9.6)

Pros : 

Cute art
Nice music

Cons :

No difficultly scaling :
It is the same game every time from the start. Never any challenge for food or paying more for materials for buildings or default happiness debuff. Or vice versa.

All buildings are one and done :
You build it and then you cant make the building work faster at the cost of worker happiness and/or food and/or maintenance or anything really. Or vice versa.

Upgrading to Commoners is weird :
It ruins the logistics of the game forcing serfs out of a home and making them move further away from their workplace. So expanding becomes really annoying and almost pointless to do. You should be able to paint a zone where they can build commoner houses.

Cant move villagers from their homes to other homes closer to their workplace.

Cant build paths. :
Have to place wells in hopes a path gets used enough to make a path.

No leader key button. : (This one seems biased because I just played Kingdoms Reborn.)
Nothing to engage you into the game to give buildings a boost or workers. So you just run the game in the background while checking back every once in a while.

I picked this game up fairly early on in its development process.  I've always found this game to be incredibly relaxing, peaceful, and aesthetically pleasing.  I would confidently say this is one of my favorite games at the moment. 9.6/10.

[h1] Detailed Breakdown [/h1]

Foundation is a game about making a magnificent, thriving medieval European village in a more natural, organic manner.  You will have to contend with the needs of your villagers as you do so, impress and appease the ""powers that be"" in the land (called the [b]Estates[/b]), and then use your influence over them to unlock more buildings and functions within your burgeoning burg.  And there are a lot of unlockable features that can make for a really lovely city.

Ultimately, though, it feels less like a city-builder, and more like a colony management game, but without the constant threats to your colonists.

[h2] The Good [/h2]
[list]
[*] [b]Aesthetics[/b]: This game is, above all, very pretty, especially once you start building magnificent churches, monasteries, and taverns.
[*] [b]Procedurally Generated Maps[/b]: Want to build on mostly flat plains with a bunch of rivers?  You can do that.  Do you hate water and flat terrain with a burning passion?  Make a map full of mountains.  Prefer a middle ground?  You bet.
[*] [b]Challenges[/b]: Once you've got a grasp of how the game works, take on the four challenges the game offers (called [b]Village Aspirations[/b]).  For some extra challenge, take them all on at once.  You'll regret it.
[*] [b]Mods[/b]: Foundation has them, and makes adding them easy.  The selection is excellent, ranging from quality-of-life improvements like manually placeable houses, to entire production chains for useful resources.
[*] [b]Soundtrack[/b]: The music for this game is really quite nice; it's generally quite peaceful and feels appropriate for a medieval European village.  
[/list]

[h2] The Bad [/h2]
[list]
[*] [b]Villager AI[/b]: Sometimes your villagers are really dumb.  Out of food?  Just go to the other market stall, they have plenty.  They also seem averse to moving to housing closer to their workplaces, and manually evicting them makes them [i]really[/i] unhappy for some reason (can't imagine why).  It's a fairly minor gripe, I suppose, but it's probably my biggest one with the game.
[*] [b]Repetitive Events[/b]: The game has about eight or nine different random events it pulls from.  You will see the same events a lot.  ""Yes, yes, the King wants some wood for whatever"".  ""Okay, now it's time for a Berry Festival"".  ""Oh, the Church wants wood this time"".  ""Heavy rain for forty days.  Swell.""  Again, this is a fairly minor gripe; it can be a touch boring seeing the same set of events over and over, but it's not that big of a deal.  Plus, the developers have been adding more of these with each major update.
[/list]

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

As I said at the beginning, I really like this game.  As you can see by my play time, this isn't just idle talk.  If you want a peaceful, pretty game that you can just sit back and watch for a while, this is great.  It's not for everyone, I know, but it's right for me.",1583485980,1695411866,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

So for example: 
Game: ""open a trade route with x place"". 
Me: How do I do that?
Game: ""open x menu""
Me: *opens menu and doesn't see the option because it is hidden behind a bunch of different tabs in that menu.*
This has been most of my experience, which I didn't mind because I was having fun (mostly) but it was annoying getting stuck because there are so many hidden menus within menus. I think the bottom task bar is too simple for what is needed. I think the book's pages should be separated on the controls bar and easily accessible.

You build a nice market, you advance your standing with the merchant class and can unlock new buildings/mechanics. The same goes for the clergy and kingdom. Build a nice church: unlock more stuff to build for a church/monastery, build an impressive keep unlock more stuff to build for your forts/walls.

However, after an update to the game this also comes with a huge penalty:

If you build a market with nice decorations your standing with the merchant class increases, but, your standing with the other two are reduced. The same goes for the other factions, making it so you have to spend an absurd amount of resources to increase your standing with all three and keep it at a high enough level to enjoy the benefits.

This mechanic forces you to always play with privileges (Of which you get 3 per faction, think of them as boons for your city) assigned to reduce the penalty. This eats up 5 of your 9 slots leaving you without much to do fun stuff with.

I don't mind the penalty system, but at the current stage it is incredibly harsh and simply not fun.

I recommend waiting until this is addressed (If ever).

Original review:
Okay, I spent a weekend with this game. Here's my takeaway so far.
From a macro perspective it starts pretty fun. It quickly goes downhill from there.
There is NO MICROMANAGEMENT in this game. What I mean to say is, you cannot tell a citizen to stop doing one thing, and start doing another.
Citizens will literally walk from one end of the map to the other - just for some berries. You could have 5 markets in between them and the market they decide to go to, and their job and housing may be in one corner of the map, but for some reason those berries are just so good on the other side! This is a HUGE PROBLEM.
Buildings are built, then that's it. YOU CANNOT RENOVATE THEM. You can destroy them and build new ones (which cost full resources) OR you can, oddly, somehow, for some reason, build ON TOP of them. You can literally build a skyscraper building on top of another building, IE, you can build a new Church on top of your existing Church.
There is NO HORIZONTAL footprint adjustment for buildings. It makes ZERO sense, and is absolutely ATROCIOUS to look at my skyscraper treasury building - which is insanely tall, but cannot be built any wider/longer because those are preset dimensions.

I have issues with building. I have issues with resources. I have issues with AI pathing. I have issues with not being able to have more insight into making things work. 

This IS NOT a game you want to buy and see if you will refund in 2 hours. 2 hours is NOT enough time to uncover the nuances of this game and why you WONT like it. That will likely take a day, or two days, of playing each day.

This game is like communism. Sounds great on paper, but in execution, it's absolutely terrible.

Maybe start having Easy/Normal/Hard settings based on this ""foundation"" instead of trying a one size fits all approach? (can't please everyone) One of your best patches in a long time.



Edit 3: Like when you try so so hard and as a result keep failing because you can't relax. This game is trying hard to be better and yet keeps getting worse.

Edit2: Ostriv is putting out regular updates again, while their country is being bombed, and their game is going in a positive direction unlike this game. Check them out if you're frustrated with foundation.

I can no longer recommend this game as of the latest major patch. One of the most fun parts (building the fort, manor, church/monastery) is now broken up into more needlessly complicated bits that don't always even work during the construction phase. You could previously make a nice building and set the parts to what you wanted, now you have to build the parts in separate construction phases...maybe? it's no longer intuitive and doesn't work when you think you've done it right. The new economy trashes whatever life you want in the 2-4 tile range. Wait 45 mins with max happiness and employment, warehouses and granaries full,  every building you have researched made, only to be able to build one more building and have to wait 45 mins for the next. Ain't nobody got time for you broken ass economy system. What's the point of a new progression system if you lock it behind 20 hours of auto-play just to get enough money to build? Why did you slow it down and make building more expensive? Fix your broken ass economy, fix the cost of building minute details (100g extra to construction for a fountain in a system where adding to it later no longer works....) 

Your game was fun and you made me uninstall it because I know the speed at which updates are made, it could take months for this to be fixed if this even something you think needs fixed. Before this patch you would have been an EA example and now I wish I could get my money back.

Edit: Economy is still broken as of latest patch that included lots of ""balancing"". It's probably worse, wtf are you doing to your game...",1672222528,1694769293,True,0,0,0.515872478485107422,0,True,False,True

EDITED REVIEW: Developers reached out and we isolated an issue regarding my computer, not their software. I'm quite pleased with their outreach and support. Game is honestly a must-have for anyone who enjoys building their town without micromanaging every aspect of the residential side of things-- having the residential district organically build itself is quite brilliant, in my opinion.

This is much better in terms of not stressing me too much. You can place your layout freely unlike grid based city builders mentioned above or Citystate, Sim City and similar games. There is a free marking tool to mark the areas, and you can expand some of the key buildings such as tavern, manor, chapel, church, castle and so on. As you decorate you gain points if you are going that direction, which unlocks more tech to further explore other strategies. There are various of path to chose from and choosing one over the other stops you from gaining the virtue path of opposing choices. It has a nice progression and visuals that I also wanted in terms of seeing my city and style grow and be different. The other choices mentioned were to survival based or strategy based.

Overall it is a nice game that can get hectic if you choose that mode or path, or you can manage and grow your civilisation. As you grow you need to buy territory which increases cost similar to other games.
You need to think ahead or learn the game first to realise that you need ample space to expand your buildings such as chapel, where you need more housing for monk and nuns, the ability for them to grow herbs, the church bell to attract and reminder citizen of service, scripture hall and so on. Similarly, castle, manor, taverns and such can also be expanded upon.

Naturally, you have trading that you unlock slowly between various other factions to buy/sell which is also a path to focus us and your main economy is driven by this. You can collect taxes if you want but it reduced happiness. 

It took me 5 different games to find this one where I can focus on building, trading and expanding while also consider adding forts if needed.

Overall, it took me 34 hours to find this game playing the other ones mentioned and more.",1694173110,1694173110,True,54,0,0.82843017578125,0,True,False,True

Many of the complaints still remain but one thing I really reacted to these next 30 hours was the residential zone. It's horribly annoying, especially considering they apparently won't build on paths, so you'll have to forbid the area and let the path dissipate over several days. 
The automatic housing placement hates you, sometimes you get several identical houses in a row, very medieval fluid city builder. Sometimes it just doesn't build in an area, people demand houses close to their places of work. The option to going wide is then to go tall which in this case means stacking production buildings and churches inside each other. How about a single church building with several smaller sheds inside to house 1,000 citizens instead of 10 large churches spread throughout the city.

Final result again is a thumbs down, it mixes and matches both Anno and Settlers but without the good parts. This ends us up in a city builder that seemingly punishes you for expanding and advancing. Not by requiring more complex industries and infrastructure, but by making everything just stop working. The critical infrastructure just doesn't scale enough and the lack of varied infrastructure buildings like storage is the nail in the coffin.

-----------------------------------------
So this game took me about 40 hours to get all the achievements in the least optimal manner in its current state (1.9 as of writing). Ten hours later I still haven't gotten the last achievement either through bad luck or bugs.

There's so much good in this game that's utterly ruined by awkward mechanics and horrible population behaviours.

Let's start with how this fluid village/city builder scratches that city-building itch I haven't been able to scratch in decades, for the first hour. The longer you get into the game, you discover how most of the elements in the game take you out of the dynamically growing village-simulator it should be and into the grind of a tycoon game.
The early game leads you to explore resources and population mechanics that seem appealing initially. Unlocking territories, desirability, progressing through different trees for the church, military and markets to unlock buildings. You juggle your few serfs to get your economy rolling and keep them supplied with food.

Midgame, like an hour or less into the game takes a sharp downward turn. Your economy won't be stable enough to support expanding across too many territories. Spreading out reveals one of the most glaring flaws in the game, peasant pathing which works in a small village but breaks once you start a 2nd village or tiny work camp. The buildings all look too samey, there's no real variation to the things you don't build manually.

Population is limited to a few immigrants every week depending on how well you keep everyone employed, housed and fed. In the early game this means you pump out unnecessary industries just to employ people to grow your tax base further. Forget building up a supply of idle workers to jump start a new sector of industry, you'll have to wait out the immigrants one building per week at a time.

The graphics are reasonable, even good considering the scope of the project and possibilities you have, no complaints here.

I'd love to be able to recommend this game as the idea and formula would be something great to build upon and experience. But the irony of the situation is, the games own foundation is so far too shaky and unpolished to build something like that on.",1674826227,1692787263,False,37,2,0.548250794410705566,0,True,False,True

The overhaul of the progression is a good direction but it's very convoluted. The tasks you're requested by other villages are incomprehensibly hard to follow. Always short on resources with seemingly bugged building mechanics. I could never add a decorative roof to achieve the 'market splendor' saying I had no cloth when in fact I did have cloth. 

Furthermore, the tracking needs of buildings and villagers is next to impossible.  Everyone is saying they're hungry, I have 100s of bread and fish with markets available to the point where I am barely making any money each turn but people are still hungry? I dunno maybe they need a more casual mode or something where you can automate some of those functions.

For me? Having to keep track of each individual villager and where they live in order to ensure food and water is being consumed properly, is too much brain power for me. I just wanna vibe and build, but villagers are perpetually starving to death because they ""can't reach food"". In reality the issue is their work/house are too far apart, but to alleviate that you have to make sure each villager lives near their work, and that each job site/mini village has food and water access.

Too much micro management to think about for me, that's the exact opposite of what I want from these kinds of games. It isn't exactly a bad thing in general, it's just something you have to pay attention to and build your city around. Which is fine in general, just not my cup of tea.

    • The map customization feature is quite good. I enjoy the detailed control
    • The map painting feature is pretty good, but can be kind of glitchy.
    • The automatic building of housing is a great feature, specifically for this game
    • The gridless system makes the positioning of buildings more realistic
    • The HUD is informative without being invasive

Neutrals:

    • Replayability, the ability to tweak maps to your liking
    • Progression window instead of tech tree is different, but a bit odd

Cons:

    • Map painting can be glitchy and doesn’t seem to always apply what you are painting
    • Population leaving while at 90%+ happiness
    • Inability to see what needs I’m not fulfilling for visitors
    • Marketplace building is not very intuitive, can get confusing
    • Building add-ons are a neat concept, but the mechanics are not friendly
    • Bailiff to find ore might be the most un-intuitive mechanics I’ve seen in this type of game in recent memory.
    • Graphics for buildings are decent, along with the forests, but beaches and water seem like they’re in completely different games.
    • No ability to auto assign serfs. Jobs going unfilled without knowing. (should be an employment building of some type)
    • Production pipelines are very unbalanced and the pace is quite slow.
    • Workers getting stuck in areas without any indication of why they’re getting stuck.

I give this game a reluctant 6, especially at $29.99. The future road map gives me very little confidence that the cons I’ve identified will be fixed and I would be very surprised if this game could climb higher than a 6 in my book without a serious overhaul.",1692105909,1692105909,False,15,2,0.566995561122894287,0,True,True,True

I noticed the devs had made a lot of changes since I last played the game, so I decided to try it out. Oh my, what a buggy disaster it is now. The villagers are incredibly finicky from the outset. Don't be surprised if you have 10 villagers, 50 berries and a trader at a market stall selling berries who is telling you she is starving.  They apparently won't eat if there is only one food type. This is just one example of how finicky the game is. There are also menus hidden within menus (the villager promotion menu for example), and it is seemingly impossible to get someone to work at your tavern. It says, a commoner or better, you can have 5 unemployed commoners and yet you are still unable to assign a tavern worker.  Also, they put berry brewery in with the tavern pieces, as if making a tavern wasn't complex enough already. Speaking of complexity, designing certain buildings is an absolute nightmare. The tavern, church, townhall etc.. all have a plethora of parts you can add, and if you add them all at once they are static, if you make an error after it's built you have to destroy the entire edifice. Moreover, adding to an existing edifice is likewise a nightmare, as it sometimes treats the new component as a new building. They need default, prefab taverns, churches, townhalls and mines. Adding the parts is just annoying, VERY tedious and absolutely buggy. 
In the game's current state I would suggest looking elsewhere.",1641975318,1691965963,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's a lot of depth to the building construction so you can make buildings look just the way you want. 

A few annoying bugs like housing zones not accepting houses or villagers starving with plenty of food can cause villagers to leave. When you get to a few hundred villagers they leave constantly from this.  There are mods so you can make it so villagers can't leave and be able to fix things before they do.

I also like the way the towns tend to expand organically. The new map generator is a huge addition -- now every town can be truly unique and comes with different challenges depending on the map and where you found. I wish there was a search feature in the game - especially while playing modded there are a lot of buildings and resources -- sometimes I want to find where they are, or what I have already placed. For example, at minimum, when placing a well I'd love for it to highlight the others -- same for markets, bakeries, etc. When you get a town to 800+ people it is kind of large.

I also wish there was a button to automate immigration - I always miss newcomers.

Really looking forward to how this game develops for the eventual release.

In the first settlement, the builders refused to construct houses until I redrawn the residential zones.
At some point, I decided to start over and build on the shore, but after placing the settlement center, the rest of the buildings and zones didn't unlock. Game over.
After another restart, I discovered that the fisherman isn't catching any fish and is just idling in place because the fish is located at the intersection of three zones. Okay, I purchased the adjacent zones. Now the fisherman doesn't even go swimming but just idles around the fishing hut. Reassigning another fisherman and rebuilding the fishing hut didn't help.

You can't put a road there because they are supposed to create the path by walking there but time and time again the game becomes unplayable because there is no way to get them to go from where they are to where they want to go.  I'm guessing the issue is that there is a building on the path they were using which breaks the pathing.

The development has been quite a ride because the devs weren't afraid to make fundamental changes to gameplay: When they changed the financial system to a per-capita tax, I was unhappy at first because I preferred the old consumption-based revenue, but now - a couple of updates later - it all makes sense, the progression is more smooth now, the mechanics finally feel balanced and make this my favourite city builder at the moment.

Customizing the size, shape, and extent of certain buildings and walls gives the game a level of player autonomy that is missing in more linear era-based builders, where the player can only affect the look of the city by progressing. Here, rather, you can create a castle / manor / mega-cathedral as large and majestic as your imagination can conjure. 

Enjoyable progression and interesting resident management. The lack of a grid and manual-built roads is a pleasing departure from the norm.

Foundation already found a good balance of simplicity and realism with its resource management, and is stylistic in a way that looks good at a distance and holds up when zoomed in. The zoning system, however, is what makes it truly unique. While details like seeing buildings get built over time are nice, being able to place buildings in any orientation while only making zones for residences, and seeing the paths get made over time, is truly just as satisfying as any milestone. Being able to assemble larger buildings in a modular nature and how the game approaches realistic elevation differences are icing on the cake.

The main idea of the game is to have the roads, houses and shops be placed organically through player-defined zoning, which allows a nice progression and a placement of houses that matches the chaotic, yet logical and coherent mechanisms that one sees in old European towns. Other than that, a large aspect of the game revolves around building sturdy resource pipelines, so that everyone finds work and no resources get depleted at some point in the production pipeline: for bread to get on the table of your inhabitants, you need wheat farms, that will be stored somewhere before being carried to a mill, where flour is produced, stored again in the vicinity, brought to a bakery, where it is mixed with water to produce bread, which finally gets sold on the markets to a lucky inhabitant. The difficulty for the resource management is overall well-balanced and you do not easily find yourself in a position where you are producing tons of everything and don't need to worry about anything: more people will come to your town, meaning more demand for most products, meaning that your infrastructure needs to be upgrade.

With that said however, the game becomes quite repetitive after a while. There is typically only one strategy to produce a given resource, and while you still need to think about how to upgrade the way you did it currently, you end up repeating the structure that you had before, only a tiny bit bigger. The content, both in terms of buildings and resources but also in terms of events is for now quite limited, and after a couple hours you will find that you have already explored most of it, leaving yourself mostly with the objective to make your town bigger. My biggest gripe with the game is however that to me, its main objective, which is to have an organic town-building experience, is not successful: while the placement of buildings makes a lot of sense in the beginning as long as your settlement is a little hamlet, the housing pattern, where houses are farmer houses placed far apart from each other, remains the same throughout the game. This means that you will never be able to build a town with varying housing densities, where say the urban core would be densely packed, and where the rest of the town would get sparser the further away from the center one goes. 

I however had overall a very good experience with Foundation. In the first few hours, to see the town build itself before your eyes is a magical experience. While the content is indeed a bit lacking for now, I only saw the real boundaries of it and got over the game after a dozen hours. I don't think I would explore the game again in its current state, but I think it still provides a solid experience to have over a weekend. Furthermore, the game is in early access and gets updated fairly frequently, so I am pretty positive that the flaws I mentioned in this review will eventually get addressed.",1685376405,1685376405,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The changes to the way the maps are generated, the increase in agency and UI/UX feel, and the improvements to the flow of the game are marked. It is a definite sign of developer investment that they've stuck through the hiccups to keep making the game better.

As the title becomes more refined, the replay-ability doesn't improve much; the only option is to change the map, because the mechanics and approaches don't vary, but for what it is and what it does, it has continued to seek a better version of itself.

107 Hour Review -  4/10

Rarely does a game get ~worse~ as it moves from Early Access, but this cute little game just stays poorly developed. Visibility is bad. Accessibility is poor. Basic implementation of things like Esc to open the game menu, or camera zoom that isn't directly tied to the terrain height are fully missed. Panels that clutter the screen so much they had to put in a keybind to clear the clutter the game forces to exist instead of presenting the option to keep panels you want.

The tutorial, aka ""Advice"" locks you into clicking it like a child begging for attention so you can do anything at all. Mods that make it more playable deactivate achievements, so it's play the version you paid for (poor development) or make it playable but it doesn't count -- suffer if you want achievments.

53 hour review - 7/10

The early access version is promising. Though limited in depth for the moment, the mechanical and audio/visual elements of gameplay are solid. The pacing and progression feels strong, the atmosphere and ambiance are well-conveyed, and the game seems to just be waiting on a larger breadth and scope of content to emerge.

After 53 hours, I can say that the early learning curve can be steep, but once you get comfortable with the idea of setting your own engagement rate it becomes as demanding as you want it to be. If you're getting bored with nothing to do, get in there and micro-manage. If you just want to watch the AI create at your command, you can sit back and observe for large stretches of time.

It's not exciting, really. It's not adrenaline-filled. You're not shooting anyone or blowing things up. If that's where you're headed, this is easy to pass by. If you want to chill and manage some resources, invest time into making your little world functional and happy, then this is a great game for it.",1619921443,1685146027,True,0,0,0.562289595603942871,0,True,False,True

I'll be adding on to this review, as I've spent some more time back in the game since posting the original.  The original will be left below, for preservation's sake.

Updated Review
Moments like these are when Steam would really benefit from a mixed recommendation setting.  But in lieu of that, I'll be leaving it as not recommended for now.  True to their word, the devs have, indeed, adjusted balancing issues, specifically centered around income generation.  While there is still a good bit of waiting in the earlier parts of the game, it has been considerably lessened, relative to where it was before the balance changes. Then why do I still lean toward not recommended?  This touches on another specific issue: namely, the estate rating system.  Building structures of one estate lowers your rating with the two other estates in the game, in what is known as a non-exclusivity penalty.  While the idea seems fine on paper, the degree to which the penalty starts and subsequently scales is asinine, at BEST, and horrendously moronic at worst.  Unless you go into it prepared, you can end up locking yourself out of a plethora of buildings and edicts until you spam out splendor decorations and the like from the other two buildings to counteract the penalty.  Of course, depending on what you build, you potentially end up lowering your rating with the first estate you initially built up, thus leading to an extremely tedious, and oftentimes frustrating cycle whereby you forcibly hold back building locations you may potentially need, lest you hamstring your progress with the estates for the foreseeable future.  Now, for what it's worth, the devs did include an edict you can pick up within two of the estates' unlock tiers that reduces the non-exclusivity penalty of said estate's buildings on the other two estates by 50% or so, but said edicts, in addition to being several tiers in, also indicate, to me, that the devs likely know something about the system is horribly skewed, but would rather handle it this way, rather than take the time to properly balance it and make it less anti-fun.

And yet, despite that massive complaint, I only stick with a not recommendation reluctantly, because it's SO CLOSE to excellence.  Hopefully the devs address this and other issues sincerely, and lift the game up to the heights that it could and should reach.

Original Review
Let's be clear, I actually really love this game, a lot.  But the most recent update seems to have massively thrown the balance of the game all out of sorts.  Gold trickles in at such a slow pace now compared to in previous versions, that it ends up becoming a waiting game where you're literally sitting there staring at the game waiting to get just enough money for any sort of progress.  The curve eventually balances out, but a game shouldn't really feel so tedious at the start.  It's a shame to say all that, though, because the game that's there is legitimately enjoyable, assuming you can get past that massive tedium cliff (which, let's be honest, isn't something anyone SHOULD need to ""get past"" in a game, as it shouldn't be a problem that exists in the first place).",1666567694,1684766853,False,88,3,0.796170830726623535,0,True,False,True

The building feels very nice, wish more games implemented it that way as contrary to the grid system or worse yet - snap to road system like in Cities Skylines. Don't get me wrong, both systems work fine and aren't bad, but there's this certain feeling of freedom when building in Foundation. 

Gameplay wise, it's very Cities: Skylin-esque, as in it doesn't feel stressful much. Like sure, there's tons of micro management, but that's the charm of these games and contrary to other games I felt lots of relief after solving an issue. Plus you can really just... slow down with the development and instead focus on improving the present, something which I feel other games seldom allow when they constantly push you into doing things on a bigger scale. 

Optimisation in this game is quite good too, I've had some huge towns of 300+ people and it didn't slow down a bit, if it for some chance doesn't perform too good on your PC then perhaps tweak some video settings such as shadows - you won't even notice them gone. 

The game is ever expanding with new updates rolling monthly at this pace, with each introducing more to do, as well as balance and mechanic changes. Devs work in close cooperation with the player, and that can be felt when transitioning between updates, as many of my personal - but not only - concerns have been addressed in an update following. 

To add a cherry on top - there's an in-built mod support for the game hosted by mod.io, which is great. The modding community for the game is really active, and generally mods only serve to compliment the game, as opposed to some other games where mods are a necessity or straight up upgrade from the vanilla experience. 

Though not flawless, this game shows so much potential that it's pure joy reading through each changelog seeing how it develops.

There are too many conditions where your entire game can't progress because a single villager wants something that's not clear or that villager actively does something to break your village. These conditions start to compound as your village grows making it less and less fun to play.

For example, 1 unhappy commoner can cause your residential availability to be ""Nil"". This completely stops immigration, which means no new employees, which means no new buildings, which stops you from progressing or doing anything but resolving this residential problem. But you're not in control of when or how houses are built. Even if your entire village is highly desirable, it doesn't mean the AI will build a house the unhappy commoner wants. So you're just stuck not progressing until the AI does something you have no control over.

Another example is the AI tending to build only one road into the residential area even though you gave it a big area to build in. Then later down the line the AI will upgrade a house on that one road which then blocks the road so no one can get to their house. But its not clear this happened because you see villagers walking up the road just fine and the road doesn't look blocked visually. But alas, the only way to fix it is to destroy that house and hope that was the problem. Also, if you make the mistake of building something in a residential zone, the AI can just plop their house so close to the building that it is inaccessible. But again, you can't really tell so you end up wasting resources on a low chance you'll fix the problem.

There's a lot more examples which basically boil down to the AI doing things you can't control and the game not giving you clear indications on what the problem is or how to fix it.",1683210631,1683210631,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The forum unironically has a rule against ""talking about game exploits, hacks and cheats"". It is, also unironically, locked for all who aren't devs, mods or ""forum officers"" - aka the mere evil mortals of the world who would dare to point out some glaring issues with the game there.

As for said glaring issues:

- Granaries -> they hold 4 different resources. Cool. Only bread production alone obviously already needs three slots - wheat, flour, bread. Now add a myriad of production chains and do the math - the amount of granaries is ridiculous. Someone pointed that out in a forum post back in the day that I found while googling -> all they got was a condescending reply from one of the devs about how the ""granaries are working as intended"". If they intended to come across as unwilling to address criticism, it certainly worked as intended.

- Uneven terrain -> half the buildings clip into the texture and look horrid. Buildings have different entries - up to 5 or more at times - ALL OF WHICH have to be accessible for the buildings to even work. You cannot manually set paths, mind you, so let's hope you won't randomly be hit with a ""Path obstructed""-notification. And if you are, good luck finding said obstruction because adding the game development 101-mechanic of ""click on notification, be taken to point on map where issue lies"" was apparently deemed unnecessary.

- Residential areas -> citizens will consistently complain about ""insufficient housing"" after about 1-2 hours into the game. Why? Because residential areas need to be up to certain standards. That means a church and a market for the early game. Here's where the problems start: Citizens will not settle in an area if the way to work's too long, the desirability's too low, and so on - but meeting said criteria fully is not possible half the time - and when it is, it's a chore because 1. the markets aren't done well (citizens will not pick from two different food stalls in the same market - if you want them to get bread, fish AND berries, you have to build two different markets or they'll consistently only buy the first available resource.), 2. anything uneven will be ignored while all maps are anything but flat. - The game essentially demands Anno-infrastructure with a map design that absolutely does not give you the space to actually build said infrastructure. Oh, and apparently people prefer to be homeless over living in an area that isn't perfect because...logic?



Yes, these games are about optimization and putting out fires as they arise - but this game has missed the line between a challenge and nuisances that make games feel rushed and turn gameplay loops into eyerolls.

I can understand the positive reviews - it's fun in some regards and especially the modular building system is (or would be if the clipping issues didn't exist) pretty cool. I'll likely give it another shot since I've already spent the money anyway. 

But if you are on the fence:

Go replay Anno if you're looking for good logistics - and get Timberborn if you want a cool city builder whose production lines and space management are actually feasibly maintainable and FUN to interact with.

This game feels like the department for map design and the department for gameplay design completely forgot to communicate with each other.",1683199999,1683199999,False,2,0,0.494575619697570801,0,True,False,True

This used to be a nice casual builder that looked great because of how cities grew organically. The last few updates, however, the developers have fundamentally changed base aspects of the game to make it a more difficult builder. Previously, you could just build for cool factor first, then try and make it work later. It wouldn't always work, but it did often enough to make it fun. 

Now, micro has gone way up, as well as the need to make more detailed plans when building. It's still very pretty, but nowhere near as enjoyable as it used to be, where the rule of cool reigned supreme.

PROS:
* Gorgeous graphics. I love the look of the game, rich almost fantasy-like colors, nice looking trees, doll-people but in a good way. The pop-up windows contain sumptuous and well made pictures and figures, very high quality.
* Rename almost anything - something that I always want to see. You can name your village, your ""Lord"", your villagers, heck, you can even rename each and every building including houses if you want to.

CONS
* Micro-Management Hell - made worse by a less than intuitive interface. You get tips from the game system but have no idea where to go to find that setting or that improvement.  New built buildings must have workers assigned to them manually. 
* Hidden Game Ending Situations - You *must* build certain buildings in certain order or you will be screwed and have to start over.  Use up all your tools before you can trade? GAME OVER. Forget to save planks to open a trade route? GAME OVER.  There's lots of things like this in the game. Bottlenecks in the game design that you must meet but you won't know are there until you fail at them one time. 
* Trading system is totally arcane and limiting.  You start out needing two items - tools and cloth that you cannot trade for or make yourself. Even after opening a trade route, tools are so expensive as to be almost unobtainable. The amount you can trade is strictly curtailed as well so you may go into debt buying tools with tons of stuff to sell... but you can't sell it because there's no ""trading"" room.

I know I don't have tons of hours played, but I played enough to recognize a major problem, which recognizing a major problem after 5 hours is a problem in itself, no? The game needs two things: in-game information on supply/demand and distances. The production lines don't give information on how many population they will satisfy, and if you run out your city burns. Either give us the information, or be more forgiving. Secondly, without distances it's impossible to know whether needs are being met, so once again you find out the hard way and your city burns. If it's the playstyle the devs are going for, then it needs to be more forgiving when it goes wrong. 

To be clear: I don't regret my purchase and am looking forward to seeing where this game goes, but right now it's near unplayable without enough in-game information.

Over the time it has been available to the steam community it has undergone a few changes to its economy and general play, however as I revisit this comment section, it stills lacks in many areas for my taste. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent game, just not great...

Many of the ""Community Mod's"" make the Generic Game a bit more tolerable, in the end they still come up short vs. the Game's ""Snap-On"" feature's, as many of the Mod's do mesh well with each other nor the generic game...or even other mod's of the same Mod Developer....this to me is a major flaw vs. my personal experience.

Though their are many ""Map's"" ( both Generic and Modded ), the maps have a ""LOT"" wasted Area's and Boarder's -- though this might enhance a challenge for some, it's a let-down for me...feel's like the modder's and the Game's Developer's simply got lazy.  Additionally there are no map's of Plane's / Grass-Land's, some modder's have managed to make map's for the game but many of them only do so to flavor their personal taste -- which is often without consideration to those whom have never played this type of game, thus many are felt short-changed vs. both experience and learning curve's. 

Many of the resources gathered are minuscule and under-whelmed vs. the consumption rate needed to progress the experience. Additionally many of the resource's ( Like ""Boar"" ) can only be hunted or managed based on Developer Limitation's -- example; Boar can be hunted but it can not be used as leather or hide or clothing as it also does not yield a more positive return vs. the games economy. Serf's / Commoner's & Citizens are the leveling system via the game, and much of what they should be able to do...they can't ( Such as making Tool's ).  Also the people get stuck often while traveling about, a problem that should've been fixed.

The game's graphics are beautiful, with a charming hand-drawn art style that makes the world feel alive and vibrant. The sound design is also well-done, with ambient sounds like birds chirping and the clanging of hammers adding to the game's immersive atmosphere. The game's mechanics are deep and complex, with a focus on economic and political management. Players must balance the needs of their citizens, manage resources like food and water, and negotiate with neighboring lords to maintain peace and stability. One of the game's standout features is its modular building system, which allows players to create unique and custom structures. This adds a layer of creativity to the game, as players can design and build their own medieval city from scratch. The game's campaign mode offers a well-crafted tutorial that gradually introduces players to the game's mechanics and systems. However, the game's sandbox mode offers the most freedom, allowing players to experiment with different city-building strategies and create their own unique cities. Despite its strengths, the game can be overwhelming for newcomers, with a steep learning curve and a lot of information to process. Additionally, the game's AI can sometimes be frustratingly not intuitive, with citizens making strange and illogical decisions.

Resource management and town management  become really easy once you get your taxes sorted out. I have a surplus of resources just sitting there because the game has no punishment system; there's no weather, death, plague and so on. Also the promotion stuff feels useless, you don't really benefit from promoting your villagers above Serf, even in late game because every important building requires a Serf. I think if they added more buildings that require commoner only and up it'd be much better (Horse stables for faster transport, medicinal shops, armory, shipyards, entertainment districts).One thing I like about this game though is how you can customize any building, I think this game does it best. You can clip objects, snap objects from different builds to other buildings, rescale and create pretty much anything. Three issues I have with the building aspect is you can't manually place houses, so your villages will look clustered and it can ruin your residential areas if villagers form too many paths (NPCs can't build on paths). You also can't build your own paths for whatever reason or upgrade them. Be careful if you create a randomly generated terrain and get stuck with hills everywhere, theres no terraforming in this game.

I would compare it to a cheap time sink on your phone but with an unnecessary learning curve and what feels like makeshift gameplay. If gameplay was a school project I would say the team left it to the last night to make all of it.

It feels bad to give the game a negative review because it is a game that I come back to from time to time and that I can get lost in for a day or two, but objectively I should probably not.

The game suffers from two or three big issues as I see it.
Firstly I feel like it can't make up its mind about if it wants to be a complex micro management game or a relaxing and enjoyable city builder game. By that I don't mean any game with both is lacking, I feel like the opposite is true most of the time. But Foundation is complex when it comes to stuff you think should be simple and simple when it comes to stuff you want to be more precise with. Upgrades and options and different development paths or plans or tech upgrades are simplistic to the degree of almost being non-existing. On the other hand something like getting a villager to perform the basic task of sell berries at a market stall takes maybe 3-4 playthroughs to get comfortable with. 
The second problem is the gameplay. It is hallow, from time to time you get an extremely basic quest from an npc you have no connection to. And when that is lacking you would love the sandbox to be full of tools or  enjoyable to progress through instead. Right now that is not true either, it is not enjoyable (see first issue) and, bringing us to the third issue: There is no endgame or late stage.
What you see at the start is pretty much what the game will be but with more houses and villagers. You don't really upgrade anything and your needs don't really increase as time goes on. 

Right now I would say that the game was a great idea. But to quote my old uni-teachers ""Good ideas are cheap. Everyone has multiple great ideas. Kids are full of them."". Ideas are pointless unless you can realize them.

This is a failure as a realized idea and I would probably be a bit careful of buying anything that his team puts up again.

You could just as easily play a different game while this is running in the background, only popping back to check on it once in a while to keep it going. Kind of like watching your pack of Sea Monkeys grow. There isn't any real meat to the game overall. 

The biggest redeeming feature is messing about with the building architecture which can be a bit of fun in and of itself but doesn't really feel like it's enough to carry the game.

I think I went into Foundation expecting something more along the lines of Banished, but Foundation is far too easy to play in comparison. I'm not even sure the comparison is valid anymore at this point. 

I know it's still just in early access, but it really feels like so much is missing from the game, and the potential is there to take it further and make it truly good. The dropping of families and aging from the game development plan really feels like a missed opportunity. A health system, seasons, and a weather system that actually has an impact on gameplay could make the game more fun in my opinion. I play games like this in order to have the challenge of keeping the citizens happy and progressing in the face of adversity and danger. 

The developers say that they are taking inspiration from games such as Pharaoh, The Settlers, and Anno. 

Pharaoh had challenges of the Nile flooding and disease that could run rampant through your population if you didn't pay attention to your population's health needs. There were disasters if you didn't keep the Egyptian gods appeased, and even the potential of getting caught in wars. 

The Settlers is just as much an RTS as it is a city builder. One of the key goals there is to build an army to conquer your rivals. 

As for Anno, I would say Anno has rivals that you must build a military to fight against. None of the games in the series are simply nothing more than city builders. 

There is so much potential in Foundation that really just feels like it's being left out. Hopefully, more challenges will be added to the game in future updates. Right now it's a game you could fall asleep to. There is nothing here to keep me in my seat and playing.",1677511976,1677511976,False,2,1,0.484558016061782837,0,True,False,True

The game has stunning graphics and an impressive attention to detail that really brings the world to life. From the winding dirt roads to the bustling marketplace, every aspect of the game has been designed with care and precision.

One of the standout features of Foundation is the sandbox-style gameplay. You start with a small settlement and have to grow it into a bustling town through careful planning and management. You have complete control over every aspect of your town, from the placement of buildings to the allocation of resources. This level of control allows for endless customization and replayability.

The game also has a robust trading system that adds a layer of complexity and strategy to the gameplay. You can buy and sell goods with other cities and towns, which is essential for expanding your economy and acquiring rare resources. This system is well-balanced and realistic, making it an integral part of the game experience.

Another aspect of Foundation that I appreciate is the attention to historical accuracy. The game is set in medieval Europe, and the buildings, resources, and technologies are all based on real-world counterparts. This not only adds to the immersion but also provides an educational aspect to the game.

Overall, Foundation is an outstanding game that provides hours of fun and entertainment. The game is challenging yet rewarding, and it offers a great sense of accomplishment when you successfully grow your town.

In the large scheme of things,  Foundation is a great escape and full of small moments of sheer joy such as getting your church to a certain population, actually getting people to buy stuff from your goods stall, surviving bad weather, and especially when you expand the town with a bakery, brewery, and wheat farming.

This is a game that you can sit with for hours, or u could walk away from while making dinner.

built in MOD options which have an extremely easy interface to use (somebody who has never used mods in any game would have little to no issues figuring this aspect out) obviously using mods can enhance the game a million times over so this just allows for even more content.

i have put over 100 hours into this game, some things are hard to figure out right away, and keeping balance can be tricky to sort out, but once you understand the game mechanics it is so much fun to find the balance in your kingdom.

No update in over 3 months, and no official communication from the devs whatsoever. This is NOT how you should run an early access game. Give your investors at least bi-weekly updates on how the development is progressing. Be upfront about issues you are having, if any. Keep your roadmap updated. These are things that BUILD TRUST with the people that believed in your project enough for them to give you their money before the product is finished.

Not arguing that the project is dead or dying, or the developers ran with the money - but going early access means you have a MORAL OBLIGATION to engage with the people who decided to buy in early, and to not go AWOL for over a quarter of a year. You can't just forget about that. It's extremely unprofessional. Get your shit together.

Fun medieval themed city builder. There are three Estates that need to be juggled to fully progress the ""tech tree"" that requires some planning. You have to acquire and store food to keep your villagers from leaving your town, but it isn't terribly difficult to do. Other collected materials like wood and stone are used for new buildings or refined to make new materials for trading or more new buildings. Money is made by trading goods, taxing your people or sending soldiers off on idle missions. I like that I don't have to fight off ""invaders"" or some enemy. It's just a nice relaxing city builder and not a survival game. 

Only minor issues for me:
*Placing walls is a little sketchy, probably because of my subpar computer, but it is the only building placement that has issues. I'm sure it will be tweaked eventually.
*I wish they had more default names for the villagers. If one of the goals requires 500+ villagers, should at least have that many names in your system. After a while you get new villagers named MALE #371 and FEMALE #42. Villagers and buildings can be manually named, though.
*Sometimes the villagers take a less than straight path from A to B, but it's more of an observation than an issue.",1676864635,1676864635,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There are some major issues with this game that I will list below and hopefully the developers can input their thoughts and experience because this game is still under development after 3 years apparently.

1. [The game is extremely laggy even when played on a powerful computer.]
I have an extremely powerful hand-built gaming computer, and it was really hard to run this game without putting the graphics on to the lowest possible settings. (It still ran kind of laggy when I did this however, but much more efficient I suppose.) I recommend taking away some of the grass animations, because the grass not moving seemed to help quite extensively. 

2. [It is VERY hard to understand how to play.]
This game is held back to a greater extent by the knowledge limitations that the player has. The tutorial isn't that great and I highly recommend adding to it for simplicity. When I first opened this game I was thrown in to a world without any idea of how the controls work or how to get villagers to work on tasks, (still don't.) For some reason the system just doesn't register that I have created a collecting area for a wood mill, and the game just constantly tells me that the wood mill doesn't have a collecting area. You're thrown into this world expected to already know what to do (to some extent), and the tutorial lacks any basic guidance that actually helps the player to understand the underlying mechanics of the game.

[I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE AGE OF EMPIRES 3 TUTORIAL STYLE] <--- This right here is a great tutorial, its extremely simple, but it helps you out with all of the questions you may have, there is a second part to the tutorial called ""Try a Game"" in which you actually play a mock game that is set to an easier mode. I am not saying that you have to model your own tutorial after this, however, I highly recommend it because its so simplistic but gets the job done all the same!

3. [Quite a few bugs]
There are a few bugs that I noticed during my short game play such as certain building pop-up windows (like the wood mill) not closing when prompted to close, or being stuck in the same place on the screen. The aforementioned issue with the designated collecting area not being recognized by buildings and/or villagers is a huge one that NEEDS to be fixed. At a few points I did notice that villagers were just standing around even though they had designated jobs to do. Wasn't really sure exactly what was going on, and this again can be remedied by tutorial that actually helps me to understand the basics of the game.",1676388760,1676388760,False,2,0,0.454349219799041748,3,True,False,True

some really annoying things i  regualrry see occuring  you have maximum positive immigration modifiers and still get what like 4 new pop per week thats not alot. (at 350ppl in my town)

i really like the looks of the game though but thats not really enought to play this extensively imo
the freeform building is nice but that gets boring quick if you arent a ""beauty builder"" type of player

next thing  it really is hard to min max stuff since you cant really tell if you have to many or to less of something
most events i saw are kinda meh too like dont read and choose 1 optioon form e most of the time since i have mostly everytting stockpiled anyways

Foundations charm comes from it's simplicity but the ability to build complex sets with the monument feature gives me the same sense of building exploration I had with early Minecraft.

The game advertises itself as laid-back and it delivers. There isn't a real rush to do anything and you are free to view and plan your growing city at your own pace. Resources are plentiful and infinite so deleting older parts of you city and rebuilding as you learn new techniques or unlock new buildings isn't a pain.

Apart from setting zones you have no control of paths and villager housing, which gives the cities a natural and fluid feel.

The soundtrack is fitting to the style of the game and it's not annoying.

The community on Reddit and Discord are friendly and helpful and there is a small but active modding community. Mods are fully supported in game. Some mods are simple resource tweaks while others add whole new buildings that have their own jobs tied to them.

1. the ability to open up the system menu by hitting esc. this is basic but for some reason they think it can't be done since esc is used to close windows????
2. highlighting locations for notifications - for example there's no ability to see the single location that doesn't have resources for construction. It's just somewhere sorta close to the center of your screen so you click on multiple locations. same goes for highlighting villagers who have notifications
3. something denoting the front of the building when placing new buildings - like a green arrow? - this is important based on the organic paths
4. rejiggering of maintenance costs on buildings - few buildings should be 1 gold less IMO. you end up with too much maintenance costs that you have to tax your serfs like 50% to be able to build anything else and give them better food.
5. to be able to see desirability area of effect for buildings after you build them. For example, how much does the well improve desirability? How close do you need to build your wells?
6. wheat farm should produce more wheat than it does. I keep expanding the crop field too
---------------------------------------------------
 I'll update this later - but so far after 4 hours this is a cute little city builder game. I love love love the organic paths and the fact that you don't have to build each and every house separately. (Looking at you Banished.)

The learning curve isn't terrible. The game is very chill. You have to be picky with the quests and sometimes just refuse them. The estates are a little tricky. I should have picked the kingdom. I didn't realize you can promote your serfs. 

Some of the UI is a little clunky with the editing/building. When you open a window for a building the bottom of the window might be below your screen. It needs some kind of tool tip adjustment.

After 10+ hours of play time I have one pet peeve - You have multiple places for alert notifications - like a villager has no access to something they want and you can click on that notification and it moves the screen to that villager but the villager is not highlighted so you have no idea which of the little ants scurrying around down there is the unhappy one. Same goes for building notifications. You can know 8 buildings have full storage but you don't know which ones without just mindlessly clicking. 

I'm losing interest in this game as I wait for their next update. Last news about an update was Dec 2021 and it's July. I am looking forward to that update.",1656477665,1675136991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Old review: This is basically ""Dawn of Discovery"" without the sailing issues... yet? Seems the same people/job ratios exist almost. The exact same professions are used. Some confusion exists where DoD tells you EXACTLY what you need to place (fields of wheat) and what efficiency it is at like 50% - telling you that you need more farms for a windmill for example. This game does not do that. You need to experiment a little to see how much wheat 3 farmers will plant (is roughly about 6 times the size of the building I've found in my experience). If bigger fields are painted out they wont plant it.

Very confusing about soldiers. I cant figure out how to assign them to work at a vault after 9 hours and after reading ALL of the help sections in game. Additionally, average chances at a mission success with 6 soldiers (5 of them armed with swords) resulted in 6 dead soldiers. I don't get it, 3 of them were partially trained as well. Whatever, I'll figure it out.

Is there no paint marking for a dairy? Do cows just roam around? Who the hell knows? Nobody in the forums seems to know nor do I. Maybe the devs will give us a paint marker feature for designating cow fields / sheep fields so it isn't confusing? I am a goat farmer in real life and those dang things wont stay in a fence if you have one, so I cant imagine sheep and cows would just willingly stay around their owner's building. They wouldn't. Is that what the decorative fencing is for? Who knows? Maybe I'll try it.

Do the buildings, aside of houses, ever get upgraded? No idea.

Graphics are very nice. The weather thing where it rains for seemingly a month straight is iffy. I don't mind the rain but why the hell does it last so long? I like that it affects crops but honestly rain actually HELPS crops unless it is TOO MUCH rain, so I don't get the penalty. Maybe unseen flooding? I dunno.

The builders system is a bit wonky. Seems to take them a long time to figure out what to do and then to do it. The prioritize button seemingly doesn't do anything.

Would any of these issues keep me for having a dam good time playing? NOPE. I am loving Foundation and cant wait for the devs to release more for it. It gets a solid 8 from me as it sits. One of the better games I've played recently.

If I discover answers to my questions I'll add a guide at some point so others aren't so confused.",1625347024,1674273571,False,0,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,True

Many updates later and what clearly appears to be a passionate team of devs has really brought this game to life. 

Great work!

I still think the tutorial is a bit lack luster but it's greatly improved since my original review. The information has cleaned up quite a bit too.

8/10, would recommend this.


I want to love this game, but there are glaring issues that leave me dissatisfied. 

In it's current state, I can not recommend this game to anyone but more seasoned city builders, and even then, you may find yourself frustrated by basics you are used to in other games.  

Reasons why:

1.) The tutorial is lack luster. A long read window you will have to refer back to constantly for the beginning portion of your game. I will say, at least it is there. It is a nice tool, but not a good replacement for a working playable tutorial. 

2.) The information you are given is poor and hard to understand. Your citizens are unhappy. Why? Who knows.  All you are given are hard to decipher icons and bars. (Bars that fluctuate rapidly with no rhyme or reason.) Is that a food icon? Pretty hard to tell. I had to go find a wiki page to realize that. But I have plenty of cheese and bread! Turns out, serfs only eat berries? Only reason I figured that out was googling the problem. I shouldn't have to do as much googling as I have to play this game. My villagers won't make themselves houses. Why? Turns out, not enough space. Again, I had to find an obscure old forum post to learn that. Again, wasn't information readily available to me in the game. My commoners won't upgrade their houses. Why? Desirability apparently. Again, another thing I had to learn through google searching. The game should tell me this!

3.) The ui is confusing. Why are there two separate buttons for territory that are the same icon, but perform different functions? And why is that not in the same menu? It's also littered with alpha game artifacts, two years after it's EA launch: https://i.imgur.com/JC6Phig.png

4.) The automation of the game is cute in concept but functions poorly. I understand that part of the appeal of the game is to let your village grow organically, but you have absolutely no control over where your villagers plop down their housing. The road portion makes a ton of sense and I like that bit, but when it comes to your villagers housing, they throw it down kind of anywhere, taking up a ton of unnecessary space. I have a TON of dead space around my Lords Manor because of how willy-nilly my villagers dropped their houses: https://i.imgur.com/nYHHzXe.png  Personally, I like to build neat and tidy little villages and cities, but this is just a nightmare. Maybe out in the country side, you can throw up a cute little cabin how you see fit, but in the middle of your city center, you don't toss up your building up catty-cornered and kill a ton of space. Maybe make it so you can toggle this on or off. 

I will most likely continue to play and I genuinely wish to see this game grow and improve, but in it's current state I do not recommend it to other players.",1614022644,1673770259,True,0,0,0.541078627109527588,0,True,False,True

The snapping function on building placement is unnaturally aggressive, the game doesn't properly differentiate between purchasing territory and land taxes in the reports screen, the housing system being almost entirely AI driven is still very awkward to work with and there's not a very clear indicator of what triggers housing density vs new housing, and there's still not an adequate description of what promoted villagers will actually demand of you before you promote them so you can prepare appropriately. The experimental map generator produces maps that are incredibly small compared to the standard ones, and any map with significant altitude differences is incredibly aggravating to look around, as the camera panning function doesn't have a manual altitude control from what I can tell.

Additionally, the game has to be manually shut down from either Steam or the task manager when you close it, as it stays open in the background otherwise.

All in all, 5/10, seems to be marginally playable now, but still needs to add more tutorials and adjust the game logic. Many aspects of the game are only explained in the help window, which I only discovered by accident while browsing the keybindings page.

Bought it yesterday and put 7 hours into it so far. I like the organic looking villages you create, you put down the production buildings and the NPC's create the natural looking paths by walking repeatedly over the land. The NPC's also place their own housing in areas you designate. They don't always do a great job of placing them naturally, but it is good enough.

Only downsides are the tutorial which is ok, explains some things well, but others just leave you perplexed when you try to put it into practice. The economy and morale systems are confusing, sometimes I have a bunch of money, sometimes I am broke, I have no I idea what I did right or wrong in each case. The UI leaves a lot to be desired, it needs a lot of clicking around, randomly selecting stuff to see if that fixes the issue you might be having.

It is a mostly pleasant experience to play, though still feels early access in the tutorial and UI which can make parts frustrating. The game price is a bit on the steep side for what it is IMO, even with 20% off sale price. It feels like games that are normally £16 rather than £25, It is a decent game, but not worth enough to be priced as a premium indie game.

Update: After putting in more time, I have come to realise how lacking in depth the game is, each play through will be basically the same, just vary in how you lay things out on different maps to your tastes. It is quite cathartic to play, but don't expect to have to engage your grey matter much.",1672833516,1672910250,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There is something about this game that feels too idle, almost mobile clicker. I think it stems from mediocre animations, and the simplicity behind the villager needs. You plop down a forager hut, assign people, and you suddenly have more berries than you need. You assign one person to cut down trees and you immediately can build a full starter town. There is very little conflict, the simulation runs shallow, and the predictable routing of the villagers makes it feel psuedo-idle. I don't really love building/decorating games either, so the feature of customizing buildings doesn't greatly appeal to me.
Then, the interface. It doesn't look bad, but its not the clear how to use some of the menus at first, so I think those take away from understanding some of the details of your town, not just in the beginning, but during the journey as you are hours into the game. 
Finally, I really don't like building up the slope. This is a personal one, but you would think that maybe there would be some reasonable, flat valleys or gentle rolling areas, but on both the original and auto-generated maps, my only areas to start feel like cliffs. I am fine putting a gatherer's shack there, or a timber camp, but my not my whole village.",1672888713,1672888713,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,True

I have been waiting to try the mods until after I had unlocked every achievement, so I'll be doing that next.

The graphics and gameplay are fun. This is a great city builder with an emphasis on logistics. It is important to make things accessible to your villagers and liberally dot markets, wells, and supply storage around the map. You can focus on farming and labor, military, or clergy routes or do all the three at the same time if you wish. There are really no permanent maluses for doing so, which is nice. If you're achievement hunting, you can lock yourself out of doing some in a single playthrough if you aren't careful. With that being said, the game is worth multiple tries as you continue to learn the mechanics and improve.

I've also never encountered any gamebreaking bugs or really any bugs at all for that matter.

For the longest time I was looking for a city builder that had an organic feel to it such as this game strives for.  Part of the way that the developers were hoping to make this game feel organic is through the zoning paint tool and having the villagers make their own paths.  This is where my problems with the current game arise.  The zoning painting tool, for the most part, works fine.  When zoning housing however, it can be incredibly tedious to see results that both look good and make efficient use of space.  The AI will decide on its own where it wants to place houses, often building in awful locations; when not very far apart, houses will clip into one another and other placed structures and produce results far from organic feeling.  

This is all assuming that the houses are allowed to spawn at all, because this game has a serious problem with paths.  Paths are created by the pathing AI of the villagers and the spawning of houses is limited to areas that haven't been trampled by the villagers.  Now you might ask yourself: ""why not just get rid of the paths?""  Because you can't directly remove the paths.  In order to clear a path from the ground, you need to mark the area as forbidden using the paint tool and then wait for them to fade away over time.  Even on 3 speed this takes an incredibly long time, and if you find yourself needing to re-purpose an area, you'll have to delete everything, mark it as forbidden, and then forget about it while the paths slowly disappear.  

Even from when I first bought it, this game has changed a lot with many great updates (the most recent 1.9 update has been really fun playing in the randomly generated maps) and I continue to have high hopes for this game.  I think that with some fine tuning of the villager pathing and house spawning mechanics, I will certainly revisit this review in the future.  However, the tedium needed to trick houses to spawn in reasonable locations and having to wait for paths to disappear spoils a big part a game that revolves around its villagers and the spawning of houses to facilitate more newcomers arriving,",1672294523,1672294523,False,12,1,0.660932362079620361,0,True,False,True

Waited so long for the 1.9 update but instead of being more fun it's the opposite.

[b]Balancing is the main issue.[/b] Every production chain is not working as you'd expect. Either you have an overproduction or lack of materials. It's simply impossible to build up a proper village with it's production chains on an area which is good enough for the residents. If you try to adjust one part another one is breaking down instantly. It is particularly conspicuous for the food chains - the storages are too small or there are not enough workers (because they don't like to work) or oppositely you have full storages all the time because one part of the chain is lacking of proper numbers the same way.

Besides the costs for territories and maintenance for buildings are insane compared to the income you are able to generate (even with 200 residents or more with/without promotions).

The lack of balancing is the reason for the non-recommendation. For players who like settlement/economy games it's not even a challenge because you cannot do ""the right things"" in order to get the game running smoothly. 

[i]I don't understand the developers - just take a look at the most used mods. It's all about balancing - larger storages, more workers, upgradable builings etc. I'm not the one who wants everything immediately - it's about fun. This kind of non-economic-based gameplay is just frustrating.[/i]

Es ist ein wunderschön aussehendes Spiel mit einigen netten Mechaniken (z. B. Wegebau) und Sounds.
....
Nachdem ich das Spiel über 300 Stunden gespielt habe, kann ich es immer noch nicht empfehlen.
Ich habe so lange auf das 1.9-Update gewartet, aber anstatt mehr Spaß zu machen, ist es das Gegenteil.

[b]Balancing ist das Hauptproblem.[/b] Jede Produktionskette funktioniert nicht wie erwartet. Entweder hat man eine Überproduktion oder Materialmangel. Es ist einfach unmöglich, auf einer Fläche, die gut genug für die Bewohner ist, ein richtiges Dorf mit seinen Produktionsketten aufzubauen. Wenn man versucht, ein Teil anzupassen, bricht sofort ein anderes zusammen. Besonders auffällig ist es bei den Lebensmittelketten - die Lager sind zu klein oder es gibt nicht genug Arbeiter (weil sie nicht gerne arbeiten) oder umgekehrt hat man ständig volle Lager, weil einem Teil der Kette die richtige Anzahl fehlt in der gleichen Weise.

Außerdem sind die Kosten für Territorien und Instandhaltung von Gebäuden verrückt im Vergleich zu den Einnahmen, die man erwirtschaften kann (selbst mit 200 Einwohnern oder mehr mit/ohne Beförderungen).

Die fehlende Ausgewogenheit ist der Grund für die Nicht-Empfehlung. Für Spieler, die Siedlungs-/Wirtschaftsspiele mögen, ist es nicht einmal eine Herausforderung, weil man nicht ""die richtigen Dinge"" tun kann, um das Spiel reibungslos zum Laufen zu bringen.

[i]Ich verstehe die Entwickler nicht - man schaue sich einfach die am häufigsten verwendeten Mods an. Es dreht sich alles ums Balancing - größere Lager, mehr Arbeiter, erweiterbare Gebäude usw. Ich bin nicht derjenige, der sofort alles will - es geht um Spaß.

GRIPES: (after 30 hours on the same map)

-500+ population starts intense lag. 600+ pop causes frequent game crashing 

-repetitive courier/merchant/yada yada for no real gain late game

-randomization of Masterpiece ""secondary criteria"" can make for some not so great combos to build (i.e. frustrating: ""place this GARDEN above ALL BUILDINGS"" but there's a fort on the tallest hill on your map...) 

-300+ pop and the name generator stops (FEMALE #1456/MALE  #786) which brings the game to a dystopian area aesthetically 

-Pop pathways: I can't stress this enough. If I have a granary right next to the market stalls, both fully staffed, why are the transporters/market stall serfs not SUPPLYING??? If I have a warehouse NEXT TO a builders hut, why are they walking across the map for supplies when they can get them right next door? Why am I getting ""no resources"" pings when I have those resources and they aren't marked under ""stockpile""? 

-trade triggers need to happen more frequently. I need to be able to buy more, more often

Just unlocked the sculpture shop, which is needed for so many of my new constructions, but I have no idea how to build a sculpture show. I believe in early access the sculpture shop was an extension of a stone smith, but that appears to no longer be the case, Wherever it is, I cant find it, and there is no in-game instruction help. On top of that, ""adding"" to pre-existing buildings is massively confusing. You can click a building once, and access a ""Build Sub Building"" option, but if you click the same building twice, you can access some sort of other 'add building"" option. What is the difference between adding and adding a sub building? No Clue. On top of that, half the time you go to add, the parts you add are ""Too Far Away"" - but again, no indication as to why... to far away from the designated base? Too far from other pieces? And sometimes you just cant add pieces - I was building a market and wanted to add a ""basin"" piece, but it was ""too far"" no matter where I attempted to put it. No idea why. Also, the perks you can get from meeting certain criteria appears to be bugged. ""Unlock 200% increase in prestige by having 15 decoration pieces: 0/15 currently satisfied."" So I added 15+ decoration pieces only to be met with the same ""0/15 satisfied"". Created a brand new market with 15+ decoration pieces only to AGAIN be met with ""0/15 satisfied"". And I'm not even knocking the places in the game where descriptions of items are ""To be determined at a later date"".  I *like* this game, and I""m going to look up all these things I'm complaining about now. In reality, I really should't have to. Oh, and I just started getting ""Nil"" for my immigration status - no idea why.

Previous review: A Work in progress:

Negatives:
The interface is a little clunky and not always responsive.
The game runs slightly slow on my laptop, but doesn't ever crash.
Fewer issues than earlier versions (Not finished and the lack of tutorials will leave you looking online for help.) Short Tutorial now leaves you looking for where to or how to do somethings. 
The NPC's still run out of names too soon and the pathing need work still(gets stuck in a few situations)
Figuring out the auto-snap off/on is an old feature they've given such a tiny switch that is a pain to click on. But somewhat helpful. Hotkey for the win here.

Good:
The way you can custom build things is nice.!
The progression is fair to good.
Settlements are fairly easy to keep alive.
added: + the new mission screen is better than before. A mass select or quick pick team button might be nice.

Neutral:
You have to get a feel for building placement.
OKAY new Maps! the added random map is sweet, it still gets really funky cheat sectors but it is better than just the 4 starter ones. (redacted: 4 map types and they never change.)",1580102977,1670400078,True,0,0,0,3,True,False,True

---

I wrote this anecdote as an intro for my first review, this review was negative and still represents one of the problems in the game well.

Now that I've been playing for some time, I have to massively revise my first impression.

 
At first I thought it was a bad game with some good ideas, now I think it's a brilliant game with a few glaring flaws.
 
In my first games on version 1.9 I had the best time of my life for the first 10 hours, after that it was extremely frustrating due to the very restrictive and, for me, not very well thought-out balancing. But after 30 hours you get the hang of the mechanics of the game and it's even a little bit too easy. That's why I'm definitely still in favor of introducing difficulty sliders, which would significantly improve the gaming experience.

I've now spent a lot of time in the game and I think it's a perfect game for a long day after a stressful day at work or studying.

The game has an extremely slow pace and most of the time is actually spent waiting for buildings to be completed.

But this is usually not a problem, since it is not only great fun to look at the well-done animations or the great landscape, but also a small mini-game such as sending the soldiers is great fun.
 
The modular construction of monumental buildings is great and allows the creative design of great structures.

As Favor progresses through each Estate, there is actually always a goal to work toward.

In short - I had a little frustration at first and then incredibly much fun with this game.

I hope the developers keep working on it.

For many other thoughts I had while playing the game, I wrote a list of ideas and suggestions that, at least in my opinion, would make the game even better.",1667396137,1669409824,True,0,0,0.499809086322784424,1,True,False,True

The focus lies on building a nice town, mansion, monastery and much more. Micromanagement, optimization and efficiency of your settlement is not necessary.

AI is still an issue where game assigns a faraway builder even though there are builder's cam nearby. This really slows down the game in the sprawling settlements.

- Little-to-no metrics available to help analyze work flow and potential production bottlenecks.
- A HELP section that is so scant on actually useful information that it might as well not exist.
- Villager AI seems to become more irrational and absurd the further along into the game one goes.
- Villager AI is entirely opaque so good luck trying to remedy it of its absurd decision making.
- Resource extraction doesn't seemed balanced, especially later game resources like the various ores; and so much of the late game goods and luxuries production slows to a crawl because of ore extraction bottlenecks.
- There is a far-from-extensive list of trade-able goods that never changes or expands: produce too much of something that will never be bought because none of your trading partners will ever want it? Tough titty.
- Likewise, do you find yourself in need of buying ore to supplement the dismal lack of sources in your own territory? Too bad: nobody will ever sell it to you. Sorry.

The main gameplay is hamstringed by a multitude of progression slowing mechanics. Taxation is inefficient and slowly trickles in money, which is required for EVERYTHING, meaning you are sitting on your ass waiting for money to come in just to get to the next tier of building and unlock something silly like clothes, which are a requirement to keep the next tier of inhabitant happy.

Then we come to the 3 OTHER progression slowing mechanics. The 3 factions which all hate each other and thus progressing with one reduces your progress with another. Want not shit looking churches?

It forces you to pick ONE of three branches per game instead of allowing you to mix and match or create separate districts. I had this beautiful plan for a fort town and a monastery island and the game just told me to get stuffed. 

Logistics falls apart past 300 people. Goods just get stuck in a warehouse somewhere. Not moved around efficiently. Builders needing to walk more than 10 seconds just tap the building 3 times before calling it a day and going home.

They added a progression system, you have prosperity which can be used to unlock tiers, how do you unlock these tiers? The tiers can be unlocked through high wealth, commerce, population, splendor, and beauty giving you prosperity, higher prosperity = higher tiers. Higher tiers = more buildings available to you.

This is is a horrible choice and is as simple as it sounds. Build the way they want, improve the things they want, and you can unlock it, you [b]must[/b] be a metagamer, right? You're here to see numbers go up, not to actually see your beautiful city? Now, there is -some- freedom allowed with this if you meta-game and just make the best/most efficient city you want over ones that follow your own personalised design philosophy, appearance, or pace. 

[b]Why is this a bad thing[/b]
 
Now, why is this a bad thing? Compare this to other games in the genre. One of the games I've played for example allows you a fun progression through the levels where you have to research the tech and then you can unlock it, this allows you to unlock what you want as long as you have enough educational buildings (libraries, universities), that makes more sense in the scope of a city builder.

Another game I play allows you to get points for technology by doing the thing that tech involves, cutting down wood, hunting animals etc, as well as doing quests which is a fun interactive way to unlock better technology, and with this you unlock tech points which can allow you to build the different items, it encourages gameplay and rewards you for playing the way you want.

This game however does not reward you for playing the way you want, and instead locks the buildings behind boring conventional limits which is becoming an uncomfortable trend in modern gaming, developers of games entering genres that allow lots of freedom and deciding that 'freedom' is a conventional thing, that freedom is something that should be restricted to checklists. 

It's an early access game, such changes are to be expected I guess but if I could I personally would refund this game, at least I have an enormously large backlog on Steam of games I haven't touched so this one can be forever left in that backlog, whilst I go play a city builder that allows me to build how I want, at whatever pace I want.

Give Builders and Warehouses/Granaries a paint circle similar to the crops for farms. This will dictate where they will go, which will let you limit them to local areas. Constructions will only queue builders that have been assigned to that area.

This will fix the problems where builders are coming across the map when the local ones should be utilized. From my understanding, the only way to ""fix"" which builders are being used is to demolish the builder shacks and move them, or pause production at the shacks that are not local to current build plans.

Should have to micromanage things like that.

That all said:

This game has come a tremendously long way since it's initial release into early access.

For those complaining about patch 1.9, they most likely loaded up their old games and jumped straight into a major patch without learning the ins and outs.

I started a game yesterday, I'm at 400 serfs, and am working on the (HARD) aspirations. My Abbatical Church is almost finished building, and I'll be able to move onto 100 citizens. I'm doing all of this without trade funds, as one of the (HARD) missions won't let you. I make about two times my upkeep per month, and aside from a couple of times when I spent a lot of gold at once, I haven't been hindered by my income.

I'm finding the balance between warehouses to be much more smoother than it used to be. I think originally when I would get up to 100+ population the game would break. Sitting at my 400 serfs, I have over 5000 in food reserves, and going strong.

In addition to this, for some reason it's essentially impossible to feed and provide goods to your people in a manner that can be expanded upon.

It was interesting, had a lo of promise, and I genuinely enjoyed the game play. It was featured as one of my top games, and I really enjoyed it.

I have now put over 40 hours into 1.9 and I can say that was pretty much ruined.

It's much easier now to do a run with a variety of methods but these are not even completed. The end goals for a few branch say ""coming soon"". 

The new achievements and goals are not fun, and will take significant time and work. There have been various bugs experienced and reported, and there have been several patches with no patch notes so I am unsure if they are fixing these specifically. 

For new players, a lot of mechanics are very convoluted and they want you to read the in game guide extensively to figure out everything. And while this is technically okay, it's also been a point of contention for a long time. Personally, I didn't care either way, and I still do not, but I see the topic brought up semi frequently. 

A minor annoyance on my part is after a while your villagers stop generating names and just are numbers. This has been an issue for a long time. 

1.9 broke achievements in saves prior to 1.9, so if you started before, you will need to start again. Also if you played the 1.9 beta, it is also not valid to continue for achievements. I believe mods disable achievements, so I have never looked into them.

Been here about a hundred times. Done it. 

Please do not encourage them to make more of the same as someone did decades before.  

There is nothing to see here. Nothing that hasn't been done a million times before.   

Don't get me wrong.  It is well made.  Very well made actually.  I like the mechanics, I like the new twist on the UI for a game of this type. If you do not have one, give it a shot. 

They could of course, do something absolutely incredible further in (Nope... a long time later and they haven't).  But I can only comment on where we are as I write this.  

It is just so similar to just about everything else that has been done from 8 bit on (yeah I'm old!, and?)  

The opposite of a new business incubator.  EA is a scam factory and games like this ensure it remains that way..  I feel sorry for a lot of creator/developers as I think it encourages them to release a game far too early.

 The company was founded on the initiative of Philippe Dion and Leo Carnaut-Delord - developers who were one of the main creators of the 2014 Chariot platformer. 

The described production is a city builder set in the Middle Ages. The title combines elements known from various productions, including Anno, SimCity and Crusader Kings II. The gameplay is based on several pillars. The most important of them are the resources influencing the development of our city. For example, building it near a forest means that we have enough wood, which makes it much easier to build buildings made of this material or to set up farms. However, such a deposit may suffer from a lack of a more durable material, e.g. stone. Following the example of the Anno Foundation series, it enables the creation of complex production chains that drive the development of the city. At the beginning of the game, we have a handful of settlers to lay the foundations for the future city. Along with the development of agriculture and industry, we attract more residents to us, for whom we must provide shelter, food and work. Of course, you should always remember about the resources and money that are necessary to implement subsequent changes. The ultimate goal is to transform a settlement of a dozen or so people into a powerful, prosperous and protected medieval metropolis with a mighty castle, church, mansions, farmlands, mills, etc. The Foundation offers full support for modifications. Thanks to the provided tools, players can create new units, buildings, areas, and even additional missions, which they then share with other members of the community or use for their own purposes. Technical issues The Foundation for the PC platform is powered by the proprietary Hurricane engine, created with city builder strategies in mind. Composers who previously worked, among others, are responsible for the soundtrack. for Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV. 

A very nice game, lots of great mods, and quite addictive yet relaxed gameplay make it a perfect game for people who are creative and like strategy and planning.

Pros:
- It's the literal definition of non-linear gameplay. No storyline to follow besides occasional quests, you can build and rule basically however you want. 
- The mechanics aren't anything new, city building, survival, and resource management. But you get enough of it to play around.
- A variety of professions for your villagers to choose from, with a shallow choice for you to intervene and influence their life choices
- The options for building and decorating are mild at best, nothing worth writing about, but the mod community made it worth playing for.
- The villager progression system does quite a significant in making you feel accomplished to increase their quality of life. 

Cons
- Starting from the last Pro, the modding community is the only thing worth playing the game for, even then nearly half the mods are outdated with little activity in terms of update
- Once a mod dies, a significant portion of your gaming interest goes with it
- Updates have been extremely slow, haven't played in quite some time, and there's still no changes from the last time I played. A lot of posts, but barely any that would pique your interest in replaying.
- Once a map runs its course, that's basically it, it's done
- Modded maps are good, but my OCD picked out the texturing issues for it, a lot of clipping going around.
- The game has some finicky balancing issues where if you've got bad RNG, your mid-to-late game will suffer horribly that it's practically game over. Some may argue it's just bad planning, but when you've got surplus of 3 different foods, yet a majority of your population are starving. That ain't it, chief.

There are several tiers of villagers each having more and more demands, fulfilling their demands makes them happy which allows your population to grow, and higher tier villagers give more taxes.

At the same time I was completing both of the game's 'villager hard ambitions' one of which was not to promote any villager. Trade was only used to buy tools at the beginning and at the end when I was consistently capped at 50k coins so I was buying every single resource from each trade partner, which resulted in me being capped in every single resource imaginable, where is the gameplay at this point?

Many things are available to change but there are still some gaps. 

The core game has everything you would want: build lots of stuff, towns that develop realistically, engaging economic play. Watching the villages grow into towns is very satisfying. Definitely not for the finger twitchers out there, the lack of combat makes the only struggle a slower-paced economic one.

The speed of new development is slow. The upcoming version (1.9) will overhaul some of the key systems like trade and quests, which is welcome. It feels like the devs are approaching their final version of the game, but major updates are about a year apart.

The progression and economic system make sense, and there is a delightful visual variety to the buildings, but by far I'm the biggest fan of following the medieval villagers waddle around about their business. As this is early access, and I am about 10 hrs in right now, my main criticism is the tutorial window. I am absolutely a proponent of games which don't hand-hold, and this quality factors well into Foundation's satisfaction, but presently the instructions could use enlargement (some pictures are too small for the words to be easily readable), and some sections like Trading and Mineral Prospecting could use more clarity. That said, if you're willing to be patient, I don't foresee major difficulty. I  have every confidence that the final product will be very well-worth the purchase, considering its thoroughly-enjoyable current state.

A couple pro tips:
-Don't build too fast, so that maintenance costs don't eat too much of your base coffer
-Invest in market stalls which sell food: will generate reliable revenue, especially in a bad weather event, or if you need a while to figure out trading
-Build a manor house and assign parts of the building as treasuries to increase your coffer; also definitely assign one as a great hall for receiving envoys
-If you're planning on promoting your villagers from newcomer to serf, take note of where the individuals work and make sure there is enough cleared residential area painted for them to build houses: critical for encouraging immigration
-You don't have to promote anyone at the start of the month if you don't want to, but be sure that you are prepared to meet their needs if you do, as exemplified by the previous point for the promotion from newcomer to serf

Very smooth and polished look, especially for early access. No weird lagging out for me, even after putting in 2 monasteries and  so many hamlets around my map with so many people.
I would love to see more multi-use ingredients like wheat (used in bread and beer), so we have to moderate their usage. That is a fun mechanic! ie, Honey can make mead, we should be able to make that and sell it at the taverns. Maybe add some sweets to the list too- honey & berries & wheat?  Resource limitations feel pretty good. I can only find 1 iron mine, so that required me to use trade to get the Tools and more iron to make more things. I wish we could put out a special order for the traders. I have no access to materials needed to make glass, and my traders don't offer it. Also, it would be nice to have a way to choose the resource use limits for the crafters instead of relying on pausing production manually, vs the current system of hitting the ceiling on their storage.

On purchase in 2019 it looked like a good basis to build upon. The pathing system is visually pleasing and not seen in other games of this genre. Towns grow organically with houses placed random in assigned areas and a grown city looks vibrant and interesting. It fulfills everything for a pleasing techdemo or sandbox.

But it wants to be a game and fails miserably at that.
Always and without fail after around 4 hours i get bored and quit a map. With basic infrastructure set up I am swimming in gold and gain it faster than I can spend it. Nearly every Production chain is set up and storage is full of every item. The only things left are waiting for more settlers and building the late game structures, which all only take up your time and are not interesting. Every other aspect of the game end in tedium.
Optimising production is annoying, since ratios between production buildings are odd, if they even work. Sometimes a single farm is enough for a windmill and on the next map I need three farms and the windmill is still saying, it has no resources to work. There are no UI elements to highlight bottlenecks or efficiency of buildings, you can only follow individual villagers and watch, if they work or not. And with 100+ villagers that is only tedious.
Similar problem with happiness. People get unhappy because they are thirsty while standing next to a well and going to a different place. When villagers upgrade their houses upgrade and they become homeless for a while. Resulting in unhappiness. And since you can only upgrade villagers at the beginning of the month you do it in mass, resulting in a mini crisis just for progressing in the game.
And the UI leaves a lot to be desired. It is impossible to find, what you need since everything looks the same (and not in a good way). The sepia colours give the game a nothing identity and in some windows I can not differentiate between a highlight, a selected option or a possible option. And in the trading window buying looks like selling and selling looks like buying. The UI before the 1.7 update was bad but imo it was way more usable than the new one.

I could continue listing minor and mayor problems with the game like the lack of depth, the estate system or that every playthrough is the same, but the future of this game is more important and the reason I am writing all this. The update schedule is spotty at best and most are minor. 2021 was supposed to get 3 major updates with only 1 (and maybe a halve) beeing released. For this year 1.9 was announced for the first halve of the year and finally news about it are coming with it all sounding very minor and unimpressive.

If you are thinking about buying this game, do not do it. For the same prize there are other games in this genre, that are way better and even EA games with more features than this game. And with the lack of support from the developers and from 2019 to today not changing meaningfully, do not get your hopes up. This game is either going to be completed soon with a lot of features missing and all these problems still standing or it is going to take another five years to get to a decent state, that can be considered playable. Either way, I can not recommend this ""game"" now or in the future.",1660606600,1660606600,False,17,2,0.631415724754333496,0,True,False,True

Sadly, this seems to be another overly ambitious project doomed to remain in early access (EA) for the foreseeable future. I paid too much money on this more than two years ago and it has progressed quite slowly since then. Despite a nice aesthetic, game play does not feel anywhere near complete. Quite disappointingly, my old review still holds up so I will leave it below:

A lot of reviews include a disclaimer that they are providing a positive review because they like the direction the game is going and they hope to spur the devs with positive reviews. Overall, the positive reviews are not representative of the game's current state of development and they contribute to the zero accountability that is rampant on the EA landscape, enabling countless vaporware projects. Additionally, this fuels the absurdity that has consumed the EA market by allowing woefully incomplete projects to charge prices near to that of full and complete games.

Foundation is just okay and it needs much more work to even break through to being enjoyable to me. My primary reason for this negative review is the ridiculous price-point given the state of the game and being tired of the lack of accountability on EA projects. DO NOT pay more than $20 for this game until it is finished. The current price is completely bonkers and does not reflect how development has progressed or how close this project is to being completed. 

Check out ""recent updates and announcements"" on the store page and note how over the course of a year, the devs make many promises, have several special sale events, release a few patches, but only release one or two meaningful updates. This shows the priorities of the dev team in order of importance:  1) hype the game, 2) sell as much unfinished product as possible, and lowest priority: 3) actually develop the game.

There are plenty of good FINISHED city builders out there that probably cost less than this stagnating work-in-progress. Stay away from this title until it is complete or there is a massive discount... I wish I had.

To the devs: the cost of your product in its current state is ridiculous and I regret enabling this premature money-grab.",1617222751,1660167162,False,213,8,0.829383671283721924,0,True,False,True

My main gripe is the lack of meaningfull updates, given the fact that the Devs make way too big of a fuss out of the little updates, which ultimately are so underwhelming that the game feels like it's always about to be abandoned - being stretched thin to appear as if being worked on.

At this point I can't recommend this to anyone. It's too shallow of a citybuilder and shows some worrying signs about the devs ability, or will, to actually deliver what they promised so long ago.

While it is fun to build and manage your town at first (sort of...), that is really all there is.  Once you unlock all of the buildings, that's it.  There is great freedom to place buildings or to build areas up, but maps are small overall and you quickly hit the limit of the game.  The management of supplies becomes very simple once you over-build.  Keep your supplies at (for example) 500 pieces of each item, and there are no supply problems, even when you have over 1000 people in your city.  The military part of the game is to pick some people to become soldiers after building up a fort.  At my largest, I had about 350 soldiers, and all they do is go on missions and bring back some extra items.  You have to assign soldiers to each mission as well, so every mission is selecting 15-20 soldiers (of all types, novice to knights) and sending them off.  The ""battles"" if you will, at least bring back some extra gold as well, but even that isn't a big deal.  Need more treasury space? 
 Just build a tower, extend it as high as you can go into the sky, then while holding down the mouse, run the cursor off the map.  Sure it will take 5000 planks to build, but it will eventually add room for 75000 gold if you choose it as a treasury.  There is very little information on how to do things or the best way to do things.  So, through experimenting, you find that it really doesn't matter if you have your cow farms stacked together, sharing space, or spaced far apart allowing each to have their own little area.  Some minerals, like gold, have little use, just as the monuments have very little use.  The building speed is very slow, especially as the game gets into the later stages.  Sure you can just make more people builders, but it doesn't change things too much.  Build a bridge without any extra parts to look fancy and it takes a very long time.  

It is fun for a while, very low key playing, sort of relaxing.  However it turns to boredom rather quickly with nothing to do.  Not very exciting when the craziest things you can do are just to re-organize your city, rebuild it to make it more efficient.  That actually doesn't work because nothing is more or less efficient it seems, other than long distance.  

The biggest negative though is that the devs do not put much into this game.  They say they do, and maybe they put a lot of time into their work, but it is not well spent time.  Critical parts are not fixed in the game, and past updates have been focused on useless things (like adding 2 buildings...).  The devs rarely update the game.  My 244 hours have been from several start/stop periods, because there just isn't much to do in the game.  I start up another map after an update (which is rare), and see what they changed.  Not much it seems.  There is no goal really, and with the lack of attention from the devs, this game is falling away.",1659725359,1659725359,False,58,5,0.688949704170227051,0,True,False,True

Starts off pretty basic, then grows more and more complex as you need to learn to balance new systems and growth. Music is fantastic, Maps are very beautiful, and its just a super super chill game.

Variable game speed allows you to set a pace, you can either crank it to three and play meticulously as things pop off fairly quickly, or you can play at one and just have it on a second screen and interact periodically (for most stages of the game, it does get more interactive later into the game).

AFAIK the developer is in process of releasing its 2nd or 3rd major patch which is also a positive sign.

If I had one negative thing to say about it, is I wish they would add some sort of collision detection for the Villagers when they choose where to build a house. Often they will build their homes attached to other buildings (especially churches and manors), which does impact the visuals to a degree. 

It is a relatively minor nitpick, because as the game progresses you will eventually spend more time zoomed out as you progress from controlling a little settlement, into a city to a small kingdom.

Edit:

Forgot to add, once you learn how to get the villagers to walk where you want them making paths, you can make some awesome looking cities. Great use of the villagers and means that no two cities will ever look the same.

This game is like the inverse of Banished. Where Banished is really punishing and seemingly unfair until you get to 500 or so citizens, foundation is really easy and laid back until about the time where you start unlocking all of the cool buildings (stone manor, tavern, monestary, etc), then it turns into a slog where you're not really challenged, but best by all sorts of ""click here to win"" scenarios where you have to individually select soldiers to go out and win you gold and supplies that you burn through so fast it makes no sense not to go on another military mission.

My only problem with this game is that it turns into a bit of a snore at this point, because the UI does not do a very good job of indicating to you what resources you need to keep your citizens happy (think rollercoaster tycoon, with a visitor saying they want more thrill rides, or more giftshops, or what have you). Instead you're left scrolling through your list of citizens when it comes promotion time at the beginning of the month wondering ""Why is this guy upset about not having water or food when he lives right next door to a well, market, and a bakery?"".

Pros:
 -Really neat progression arc for the first 2 hours or so of the game, you'll be glued to the screen.
 -Timeless art style like Zelda Windwaker
 -Freeform large buildings like taverns, manors, wooden keeps, castles, walls, etc
 -Gameplay is not punishing and sort-of lets you have enough time to correct mistakes before the whole outhouse goes up in flames
 -Even though you get tired of selecting soldiers for missions, you'll get a kick out of seeing how big and opulent you can make your castle before the game tells you that you'll need months to build it.

Cons:
 -Gets really repetitive near the middle section of the game
 -Footpaths are seemingly purely organic, meaning you'll have to wait a few seasons for your citizens to carve out a new path by creating forbidden zones on either side of where you would like the path to be
 -You're limited on space so much near the start of the game that you'll end up making copies of buildings you've already established just to clear up land for housing, or other structures that you get later in the game
 -Resource tracking and citizen management are not nearly as seamless as they could be
 -One moment you'll have 5000 gold from a recent conquest, the next minute you'll be in the negatives due to upkeep costs on buildings you need. If you want to buy things you have to buy them just before your bills come due or you won't get anywhere until the next month or next mission ends.
 -Your left-click finger on your mouse hand will get real tired selecting soldiers for your missions
 -The gameplay gets stale right before you get the tavern.
 -You'll get tired of repeating the same steps over and over again.
 -After a while the game just repeats itself (you get my point).

Suggestions:
 -Allow the citizens a bit of personality where the player can read their thoughts.
 -Allow the player to dictate roads the same way crop fields are painted, or extraction zones. Also allow the player to manually remove foot paths where they don't make sense anymore after the layout of the town is changed. I still have people walking around in a circle to get to the windmill from a farm when it should just be a straight shot. If I could carve that path out manually I might be able to save my citizens a huge amount of walking.
 -Make it more obvious what exactly the citizens need from the player to be happy. Do they work too far from home and that's why they aren't eating? Do they hate their job and want reassigned? Do they want to wear jewelry like the boujee b*tch they are? Whats with the scowling and the red percentage, you dang serf?
 -Instead of making the player manually select each soldier for a mission, give me a box to fill in how many soldiers I want to send of each tier (novice, soldier, knight, ect), and if I have selected so many soldiers that it requires that I have wounded going on a mission, pop up and confirm. If I'm trying to select more soldiers than I have for a mission, don't let the number exceed what I have available.
 -allow me to appoint a ""minister of war"" similar to the baliff to handle the warmaking for me (sending soldiers to fight) so I can focus on less tedious stuff. I'll select the missions and he selects the soldiers. If he's getting my soldiers killed or making me lose I have the option of firing him and replacing him, or going back to handling that myself.
 -Give the player the option to attend the battles as a commander, MOBA style. 
 -Structures such as the builders hut should have the option to focus on a particular type of project. For example, I'd like to have a builder's hut that will focus mainly on residential development, then one to focus on large freeform structures, then one to focus on grab-n-drop structures. Lets say I'm maxed out on marble (which can happen easily if none of your trading partners wants to buy any), why not allow me to switch their focus to hunting gems? I don't care if it doesn't increase my chances of finding gems, just stop the production of marble and let me look for gems there.
 -Land rental options if there is a mineral deposit I need to progress on the other side of the map, 5 or 6 territories away, allow my to rent the territory around the deposit for 100 gold a month or something so that I can develop on it and send my miners over there. Most of the time I really just need those materials for a single project before I'm able to buy my way over there, but having the option to go get them without having to spend all that money on territories I'm not going to use for hours would be really nice.

Overall, this game is a fantastic buy. Even if none of my suggestions get utilized, I'll still chock this up as one of the most fun gaming and city building experiences I've ever had.

This game has a lot of potential and it's already enjoyable.

Looking at the community screenshots it seems like the big fun is building these gorgeous castle landscapes. Personally, I feel like the tools the game provides make this pretty daunting for a new player. The quest mechanism teaches new players how to manage the key resources of the game, but it doesn't do enough to show you how to build a cool and large building. How much space should you be reserving for a keep or a church? I'd like to see some default pre-built versions of the various buildings, just to give new players a starting point and inspiration. I'd also like to see mechanical rewards for building cool things. Why should I spend an hour and hundreds of resources building something purely decorative? I guess some players find that motivation enough, but personally I feel like the game systems should incentivize doing the core fun thing.

There are also some tweaks I'd like to see:

* Why does this game support and encourage mods, but doesn't support Steam Workshop? And why does it kick you out to the web browser to view description text for mods?
* On max game speed I find myself sitting around for minutes at a time waiting for immigrants to arrive or buildings to finish. I would suggest that the current 3x speed should be normal speed, and a much faster speed implemented.
* There may be things about the game pace that deserve tweaking other than the speed. Perhaps the immigration speed, or some of the production ratios. As a new player, once I'm several hours in and I've experienced most of the unlockable economic buildings, it feels like I should be able to accelerate the growth of my town rather than just wait as villagers arrive by 2s and 3s.",1658980512,1658980512,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

Enter Foundation. It is the best I've seen so far at balancing the kind of organic building and development that was the way cities were built for thousands of years. It's GRIDLESS! I love that your villagers make their own paths and roads and build their own houses. The only thing it is missing for me is multi-use buildings. If the villagers could live above their shop or on their farm, that would be the cherry on top of this ice cream sundae of city builders.

There are a plethora of historic city builders and colony/survival sims or whatever now.

Everyone deals with anxiety in their own way, I figure. Contemplative city builders have always been a go-to for me because I find the ability to set up relatively worry-free lives for my silicon-based wards helps with my IRL inability to affect change in a meaningful way.

Foundation is a one-of-a-kind city builder that really got me hooked with the pathing and zoning for building approach, as they're quite novel. of course, thirty plus hours later I was also into designing organic looking villages with different sectors/streets for different artisan crafts and resources, mimicking the construction of 11th-14th century villages in whatever ways I found feasible. to that end, I find that Foundation - like the best simulation games really - guides you towards an organic structure closely resembling that of pre-renaissance europe, at least within the capacity of a relatively simple - I might say, ""elegant"" - city builder.

this game is great, handily worth the price, and I'm excited to see what directions the devs take it in the future. updates have been regular and substantial in quality, they're not worried about resetting things or coming up with new approaches which is honestly pretty refreshing for an early access game. between this and Valheim I've pretty much scrubbed any bad taste other early access games may have left in my mouth.",1657915897,1657915897,True,51,1,0.823735594749450684,0,True,False,True

With mods however - particularly Batyushki’s incredible modpack - this game is elevated to pure magnificence. It is everything I wanted from a medieval city builder and then some more. 

Pro’s
There’s a few things vanilla Foundation does really right: 
- the grid free system: the painter tool looks a bit crude but it does work extremely well. One of the best parts of the game is how organic houses and roads are created and villages get naturally connected.  
- the free form building tool: there are a couple of building “sets”, like the manor, church, tavern and keep, that consist of several parts that can be added at will, customized in height and placed as often as you like. This allows for a huge amount of creativity that takes a while to get fully into. There’s also “masterpieces” included, like statues, fountains and even a main gate.  
- the art style of the game: at first I doubted the cartoony look but in-game I it actually hits the right balance between charm and realism. Screenshots can be quite amazing to look at, and the bad weather effects are quite atmospheric. 

Cons:
- villager pathing. As in every walker game, the villager pathing is not ideal. Because every villager has a work, food, rest, water, house cycle, it takes some practice to understand why there can be food shortage for example when there’s food. Some people might think the game is bugged while they don’t understand these cycles. 

For example, transporters have to bring food to granaries and only then a market tender can pick it up. If your food is not abundant, they will only bring small amounts, and sometimes go all across the map when there’s closer options nearby. When a villager has his “eating” moment, but the stall is empty, it will not satisfy the need for that day and only return after a full cycle. Then if unlucky it might hit an empty stall again next day.    

There is a quite a bit of a learning curve, because some things you just have to find out along the way, and this makes the first 10 hours basically learning. Some placements can be finicky, and especially bridges are notoriously annoying. (Clear the bridge of overlapping buildings, and then reload to reset the pathing). 
On my second run I had a lot of fun on the Hills map, building small pockets of villages across the map and letting them connect naturally. However, rather soon you might feel limited in how your village looks.

Because of the way villagers & zoning work it is difficult to really create a medieval town. Most likely you end up with a sort of village sprawl, because villagers refuse to spawn housing near the city center when there’s no new jobs around, which makes for the unrealistic sprawl effect. Also, once paths are in place, they won’t build on it. (You can use the “forbidden land” zoning tool, but it takes time for paths to de spawn again). 

While houses will upgrade to a tier 2 stone version (after promoting villagers), there are no stone roads and stone castle parts as of yet. This and the sprawl issue means your village will never really become a densely packed stone town. Fishing huts remain shacks and there’s no options for dock and quay construction in vanilla.

Mods 
With mods however all this can be fixed, and then some more. You can place housing manually, with lots of stone variations. There’s better and more farms, docks, manor upgrades etc. If you like to create a true medieval region map, with several villages, towns, farms, mining hamlets, etc and have the patience to really work for your food and materials, then the Batyushki modpack will keep you playing for dozens & dozens of hours. Look at discord for some of the amazing towns people built, or Batyushki’s own Tour of Arras on YouTube (recommended!). 

I generally don’t like using mods, but the game is well integrated for the modding community. You can download mods in-game with just a click and they work fine. 

Price
As for the price, I think the base game is a little bit overpriced but the 25% sale makes it just right. Mods however are free, so if you take that value into account the game becomes a steal even at the regular price of 30 euro’s. 

Future
As for the future, there’s a big update coming soon that reworks the progression system. Development of this game is steady but it does seem rather slow as well. They have communicated the aim of full release before the end of 2022, but most likely it will go beyond that as the big 1.9 update still has to come out.

Tl, dr; enjoyable village builder that is right for the sale price but because of its strong foundation can be elevated to a whole new level of magnificence with mods.",1657796112,1657797212,True,2,1,0,0,True,False,True

- Huge potential for a city builder
- Graphically superb and adapted for this kind of city builder
- Watching your population do the work and always busy in the empire you are building is already utterly pleasant.
- You cannot screw things up too badly
- Challenge is constant if you want to keep growing
- There is plenty of room for customization
- The medieval theme is greatly used
- The variety of ressources and jobs is interesting
- The rythm of the game only depends on your choices, meaning that you can choose to optimize a certain step before going to the next etc.
- The organic building of houses and pathways is a nice mechanic, which removes the annoying part of having to locate your hundreds on citizens, here they just keep on living and mention if they lack anything.

If I was asked a few ideas to make this game even better:
- Increase the customization possibilities
- Add more theme to your villages (vikings or egyptian for example)
- Add more map types
- Add barbarians camps or enemy villages which you can fight with your soldiers or from which you must defend yourself
- Increase the economic complexity, with offer and demand rates, shortage of ressources, more trading options, possibility to build hubs and huge ports
- Add a possibility to define neighborhoods which would grant additional bonuses/maluses if used properly/wrongly.

It isn't intended to be - it's a city builder, and slow growth is necessary to keep from losing all your villagers from dissatisfaction. It has a quaint art style, even cute. It's loosely based on a monarchy style government; as lord over the land and people, you decide what station in life your villagers fill, what jobs they perform, etc. The only aspect you do not completely control is when and where your villagers build their houses.

You can very quickly get board with this game - not because of it's slow pace, but because progression through the game is meticulously restricted and carefully planned by the developers. You have very little choice of how to advance your village. No matter how many times you start a new game, no matter how many maps and locations you choose to play, you will advance through the tech tree in exactly the same way. Your trade routes buy and sell the same goods and materials in every game. Certain trades are necessary to both maintain your budget and to produce certain products necessary for progress, BUT the trade routs are unlocked at particular levels, you MUST unlock them to progress, but you must meet the same progress requirements in every game to do so.

The opening ""tutorial"" style progression is understandable. You must follow it pretty closely to keep from bottoming out before you've played five minutes, but the player hand holding continues all the way through the entire tech tree.  Every village you start will progress in the exact same way. The only deviation from one game to the next will be the actual layout you develop for the village. Even this will eventually grow old since the maps are not procedural and the few starting location choices for each map are limited and hard coded.

I am frankly disappointed in the game in it's ""vanilla"" form.

It's also important to note; this game is VERY intensive on CPU usage. Oxygen Not Included, Imperion, Life is Feudal, City Skyline, Banished, and a whole list of games I play, rarely run my CPU temperature up to 160, 170 F. This game starts out at 180 and quickly climbs to 210F and more. This is NOT because of graphics settings, but because of the huge number of individual animations taking place on the map being handled by the CPU. It's why the game is quaint and fun to watch, but this kind of temp for a CPU is not good for long periods of time.",1657489666,1657489666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I wished it was either more laid back, so I can walk away for a bit and come back without a worry, or more things going on. Right now, it's pretty much both. It's slow enough that I want to walk off and do something or cook dinner then come back, but there are some things that I still feel like I need to watch and if I walk away at the wrong time, I can mess something up. I also spend way to much time just trying to figure out something that seemed like it should be more easier to figure out. So, it can be a really satisfying experience, but it also can be a really frustrating experience. This game definitely needs more quality of life improvements and it literally is not worth playing without mods. The mods do add so much to the game, which is both a good and thing, and sort of a bad thing. What I mean is, I bought this product unfinished (I know, early access) but it's just not worth playing without mods that are adding in a ton of content that feels like the devs have should of done. It's good that it's easy to launch the game, and then get the mods you want, but it feels sort of like they are taking advantage of the free work. With that said, I haven't done really any research into this, so it maybe that some of these mods could be by the devs themselves but I haven't really noticed that yet.

I do love a game that can add more life into it via mods. But I usually look for that from finished products and to see if I can either completely change the game, or change it towards a direction that's a bit different from the base idea. I love that. The amount of years I spent on Company of Heroes mods is absurd. But with a game that's still in Early Access basically requires mods to make the game more interesting and functional, I dunno. Yes, you can play the game without them, but it feels pretty lacking if you do.

I've been anticipating this game for the longest time. Eventually went ahead and purchased it once the UI was updated. It's a really fun game! So many games have tried to fill that Banished niche, and this is the closest to the feel I've found. Moreover, there are plenty of upgrades. Although painfully resource heavy, I love how the buildings work, and you can pretty much design anything here. I was honestly shocked about how open the gridless system was! 

That being said, there are some key things currently missing that would really benefit a game like this: 
- birth and death. Your villagers just kind of show up and never age.
- sickness and health in general 
- seasons 

Thankfully those things appear to be planned. A couple of other issues I have: 
 - Religion. Your church fits a ridiculously small amount of people and I have to resort to cheesing it by hiding extra nodes within existing churches. This could be easily fixed by tweaking the capacity of the core building as it is. As it stands it's really just annoying. 
- There's a lot of waiting around for resources. 
- The mid-late game is a little boring for me. There's not a lot of optimisation or automation upgrades you can add as you progress, meaning that you're kind of bottlenecked at a point. Again, it's basically a case of waiting around for resources and the sense of progression is lost.

Foundation is a game that lets you build up a medieval community within a local setting.  You build up from a handful of settlers collecting rocks and wood to a interlaced community producing wine, weapons and jewelry through a set of supply chain manufacturing processes.  However, don't get the idea that it is a war game, it's not.  Your ""soldiers"" simply go off to fight for your liege lord and you don't get to see the battles or make attacks.  You also don't get attacked--which is important to note.  The way to ""win"" is just to put together successful business strings so you can add to your population while not going broke.

The good:  Personally, I like the idea that I don't have to defend against raids or other players attacking my city while I'm concentrating on making lives better for my little digital people.  Really, however, I find that it is impossible to carry on very long without developing an army you can rent out for tremendous bonuses to the king.

I very much like the idea of paying attention to the three medieval estates:  The aristocracy, the clergy and the people.  I think Foundation does a good job of this.

The bad:  I think there are still technical difficulties as the game seems to lock up when loading pretty frequently.  Also, the game gives feedback that your peasants ""can't reach the core"" and don't have a path to their workplace.

Also, the learning curve is quite steep as there are a lot of issues you have to figure out for yourself as you try to advance.  For example, there are prerequisites for advancement of your community which are not always apparent and/or logical.  For example, you get the opportunity to build a sheep statue before you get a chance to hire a sculptor to make one.  You also need polished stone for some things, which means you need the stone mason improvement but make sure you have enough clothe or you will have to develop a trade route or build a shepherd and weaver in order to get the clothe that you will need to build a stone mason.   AH!

There simply have to be more maps.  You could let AI generate the maps or allow players to make maps, but there have to be more.  Right now there are only four or five and playing a map twice is not too exciting.   Especially when the resources (like iron and quartz) are located in just a few set (though randomized by type) locations.  The mineral locations could certainly be randomized between games to provide a little variety.  As it is, the replay value goes way, way down after you've played through each map once or maybe twice.

I'd like to see some kind of supply and demand function included on a number of levels.  Iron ore is so important to the game, but if you don't have a deposit handy it is bloody hard to get on the trading market.  Also, your little digital folks probably get really tired of tuna melts and/or PBJ's.  Since bread, cheese, fish and berries are the foods that are available, the markets should reflect that.  I think, as it is now, you need to concentrate on one thing that you are going to put out and just produce it massively.  There is a bit of a reward for economic diversity and later on you do get to produce wine, beer, honey and boar.  However, I think the game should take into consideration shortages and relative value of commodities.  It's not that complex.  Also, iron is SOOOOOO much more valuable than any other mineral.  However, if it is located far away you are going to break the bank stretching out to get it (because each tile costs you a monthly fee.)  Gold, marble and quartz are virtually worthless.  Gold.  Worthless.  It makes me scratch my head...

But beware of bad weather.  Getting hit with a long spell of bad weather and you are screwed.  The randomness of the bad weather needs to have some limitations.  I got hit with an ice age in one case and it ruined I game I had invested hours in.

Some things I'd like to see:  Commodities like Chickens, minstrels, horses, water powered vs. windmills, schools, guilds, apothecaries, archers and sausage makers.  It might also be amusing to have the unemployed turn into thieves, charlatans or witches.  Ooo...even better, have an opportunity for an envoy to come as a witch hunter to get rid of your unhappiest and least productive peasants.  It would be interesting to have envoys/monks also manifest as entertainers who you could pay to raise people's spirits.

This early access view has been a very positive experience for me and I hope developers will take some of my ideas into consideration--especially about the maps.  I think right now the value is about correct (I don't know if there is an Early Access discount) but maybe a bit on the high side at 30E.

Above all, it is a beautiful game. The design of houses, etc., is great but the main reason is the absence of grid: most medieval city builders I know are based on it and that just does not feel right. (It does bring out a problem, though: sometimes a house will block the entrance of another house. ) The first person perspective would be most welcome, also because sometimes the best tactics is to do nothing for a while.

A few other suggestions:
- builders should be able to do some terraforming, at least for (big) churches and monasteries. 
- when I tried to delete a presbitery in order to add a nave extension to my church, the whole thing disappeared. Lesson learned but that is just not realistic: churches, monasteries and castles (and other building as well) were rebuilt all the time. Sometimes they did pull the whole structure down but usually they just demolished and rebuilt the parts that were insufficient. Side aisles are not available (yet?) either.
- monasteries are for men only. That's as it should be, but they did have monasteries for women only as well, you know? Maybe one could put them next to each other, with the resulting happiness going through the roof.
- no children. I know that was a design decision, but again, it does not feel right. Schools would not be necessary - churches, monasteries and keeps should take over kids' education.

As for the difficulty, it feels just about right (once you know what you are doing). No bugs encountered.",1656851723,1656851723,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I loved how the game merges ideas from other management games (e.g. Anno for the citizen promotion system) to create something completely different but also addictive. It also de-emphases military conquest in favour of developing your own town, which is SO AMAZING, as usually I get really bored by the military/conquest aspects of similar games. 

The building system is also fantastic - it gives a lot of room for creativity while at the same time still remaining simple and fun. Think Planet Zoo system of ""building groups"", except the building ISN'T painful. 

Right now the game lacks a little when it comes to endgame content, but as it's still being actively developed I trust that the best is yet to come!

It's very similar to other games of the genre like Banished and Dawn of Man. If you like those games, this one is worth checking out. It's not very difficult but it will keep your attention for a while, and it's fun to watch your settlement grow.

Some of the game systems which might benefit from more polish are trade, estates, and villager promotions. 

Trade is kind of unsatisfying because it seems like you can never buy or sell as much as you'd like from other villages. I end up with massive stockpiles of some resources even though I've set them to be traded away. Similar situation for buying -- I only get very small amounts of the resources I need from other villages.

Estates are a neat idea but the implementation isn't as fleshed out as it could be. The Kingdom missions don't really fit with the rest of the game, it feels like a weird minigame that doesn't quite belong. Labor and Clergy estates are pretty straightforward, and a nice twist on the tech-tree concept, but the ways you gain favor with those estates aren't really very interesting or challenging -- it's basically just waiting for an envoy to arrive and then sending off whatever resources they need, while also building up certain buildings in your own village to get more splendor. I think there's potential with this system but it needs to be more fully fleshed out.

I think the villager promotion system is a bit wonky because there doesn't seem to be any good way to meet the villagers' needs at certain promotion levels. It's really hard to get the materials needed to satisfy certain tiers of villager because of the difficulty of obtaining iron. I'm constantly struggling to provide enough common goods and candles to my commoners, so I end up not promoting most villagers past serf level. It's also not clear to me what benefit it serves to promote the villagers in the first place, since keeping them at serf-level seems to be just fine.",1656459173,1656459173,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I found myself within the first 60 minutes alt-tabbing out of the game multiple times, because even on highest speed, stuff just took too long. Trade was too slow, even though I sold everything that they would buy, so I had to wait a long time on cash, so I had to wait a long time on being able to build more.

It was also very frustrating in the beginning, as the first real quest I was offered was to get 20 fish in 60 days and only after accepting I realized a) I can't build a fishers hut yet, b) I don't know where to unlock a fishers hut c) I need more splendor to unlock a fishers hut, and d) I don't really know how to get more splendor (or what it really is).  It feels like the offered quests should (at least in the beginning) be more in tune of what the new player is actually capable of fulfilling.

It also forces the ""organic"" part, as rotating to a specific angle is tricky since it's not mouse wheel but mouse movement controlled and living spaces appear in random angles anyway.

I really like the way the paths form by themselves. It's something I havent seen elsewhere to my knowledge and it is a very nice detail that made me disproportionally happy.

I love city builders. It's almost all I played, but since I played this one I am finding it nearly impossible to play any others. The main feature of this game is that the citizens build their own paths, it is so natural and beautiful that any other game has been ruined. 

Medieval towns and cities were not built in grids and Foundation has done an incredible job at making city growth feel totally organic. I can't go back to Banished or try new games like Diplomacy Isn't An Option because Foundation has made me despise the clunky straight line paths.

Pros:
-The Paths, I can't make that clear enough
-The building, many of the buildings are completely custom with simple drag and drop building
-Economics are surprisingly challenging and managing markets and supply chain is a fun job for micromanagers

Cons:
-I wish there was more involved combat, right now you just send your armies off on missions and hope for the best. A Stronghold like combat would be AMAZING in Foundation.
-No threat to life. Currently, there are no enemies that will come and attack, walls and keeps are purely cosmetic. Reaching ""end game"" can feel hallow because the goal is just to keep your people happy. This isn't a requirement for city builders but it would add a nice thrill.

I actually really enjoy playing this game on my off-time. It's optimised quite well and it looks great without hitting the GPU or CPU too hard. The main premise of this game is to build giant monumental buildings without crashing your economy, and while you try to accomplish that, your city will evolve organically. 

I think Foundation has a lot of potential in becoming one of the best medieval city management games ever created! It's still [b] early access [/b] however, so right now community input could make that potential into a reality, although that's only true if we can all collectively agree upon the same improvements.

After 100 hours in playtime, I am now writing this review hoping to reach out to the developers and new players about what I think is great about this game, but I'm also writing this review to let them know what I believe still needs to be improved based on the other reviews I've read and my own opinion.

 [b][h1] What is great about Foundation [/h1][/b]
[list] 
[*] The management aspect of the game is actually quite challenging. Seriously, I've gotten a few game-overs for trying to make ""larger-than-life"" monuments such as monolithic castles and monasteries. You got to be very careful and properly manage the city over the course of a few actual days during these big builds, otherwise you'll accidentally crash your economy to the point of no return.  You get a big thumbs up for the challenge Polymorph. 

[*] The developers are quite active and they recognise that they've got a long way to go. At the time of writing this review they've already started working on some of the improvements that I was going to suggest; such as brick roads and tighter NPC housing.  

[*]  This game is actually pretty fair-priced all considering. 

[*]  You can recreate famous castles if you want, or at least, you'll be able to if you have the patience to blue-print it and the eye to creatively plan it with the architecture you have. You can even get creative and build these monumental buildings off the side of cliffs as well. Skies the limit. 

[*] They have ease-of-access community mods and there's quite a few great modders that are already starting to make a name for themselves. Meaning this game has unlimited potential so long as it keeps acquiring new players to keep the modding community alive. 
[/list]



[b][h1] What needs to be improved [/h1][/b]

[list]
[*] The user interface is still kind of rough. The low-res pictures meant to display the citizens/church/king could be improved.  Brand new players could use some bright-red arrows instructing them where to go on the introduction, It would be a big help for them. I also kind of wish there was a high-lighting feature to mark the citizens and their homes whenever their missing necessities such as well-water or clothes. All we get is a population tab warning that says ""2 people don't have access to this image of a well or clothes"" but I can't actually find them easily. 

[*] There is quite a few pathway problems for the citizens. I mean, they follow it perfectly but that's actually the problem.  Considering the NPC's build organically they'll sometimes place buildings inside their strict pathways and this causes a citizen to sometimes get stuck in their home. To fix this, you will have to demolish their house. This strict pathway also affects ballifs from entering towers which are built off the side of a cliff despite the doorway being accessible, it can also prevent builders from starting or finishing projects. I think there should be exceptions in their code to allow the NPC to debug itself and walk through walls in the event they are stuck.  That would ultimately fix this and allow for some freakishly outlandish monuments that wouldn't have been possible before. 

[*] This might be knit-picking, but I think markets/fisheries/warehouses/farms should evolve as well. It's kind of weird to see the town go from pioneers into a medieval city, and yet all the production is stuck in the pioneer stage.  Visually it breaks the immersion, it also breaks the illusion that the town is evolving. Although, there are currently mods out there that help with this for those who think that might be a deal-breaker, so don't sweat it.

[*]  Currently NPC's build homes close to their work places. However,  if they are given a new job further away from their home then they don't always leave their old home which causes unhappiness and slows down production flow. It'll go on like this until they build a new home or leave town. I reckon tighter NPC housing could solve this since they typically won't leave their old home because they can't find space to build a new home in the first place. 

[*] A lot of people gave this game a negative review because they want to utilise their soldiers for something other than a quest they can't watch.  I'll admit, it would be pretty cool to raise up an army to oppose an enemy A.I settlement and play for territory control. Or maybe it could be something like Spore where we can also choose to overtake their city with trade instead of going to war.  Some unlockable rewards such as a golden statue or rare architecture could probably go a long way.  

[*] The locations of the rocks and berry bushes can be annoying at times and they kind of ruin the immersion. If I'm trying to set-up my city to look or function a certain way I often find the rocks and berry bushes prevent me from doing so. The main problem is, is that I have to build around them or have some of my production operating in the middle of the city. I can't remove them so their kind of stuck there while all the npcs build around them.  It would be nice if the rocks were near cliffs and if we could just plant our own berry bushes.  I realise that they are deliberately put in the game like this to encourage us to expand outwards so that we're able to obtain the resources to meet population demands, but surely there could be a better way. 

[*] It would be nice if we could update our previously built straw-roof churches, as in keep their foundation to build a new one in the same spot.  We unlock parts later on to built a nice church but we unfortunately have to destroy our old one to rebuild a new one in the same spot, and this can cause some balancing issues since the happiness will decrease too fast during the rebuild. To get around this you have to build a new church [u]very close by[/u] and demolish the old one later. If the new one you build is too far away after demolishing the old one then a lot of villagers will again be unhappy because they can't get to church on time.  

[/list]




[i] The more freedom the player has, the happier the player is. A player loves nothing more than the freedom to express themselves. [/i]



[b][h1] Conclusion [/h1][/b] 

Despite what criticisms I currently have about the game, it's still a great game. It's got a fair price-tag on it, and it can provide you with hours of good vibes without trying. If you love city-building games and you're looking for something new, then I would highly recommend that you give this one a try. Also, if you agree that this game's got potential, then you should take the time to reach out to the developers and let them know that they're on the right track! Let's keep them motivated!

Much love,

There's a focus on monument building, whether that be custom cathedrals, monasterys, or manor houses, to actual monuments and gardens. The game could use some better nuance in the construction of these buildings, though, especially to give us the ability to modify vertical placement. The number of decorations our the players' disposal is also severely lacking at this point for a game that's supposed to focus on design, so I hope they add more decorative options in soon so we can better customize our cities while also encouraging town growth which can sometimes be an issue. In addition to finnicky residential growth, which they really need to look at because the ""no access to comfort"" and ""insufficient housing"" when there's plenty of space with high desirability designated to build on is extremely frustrating, the AI could also use some tweaking for access to various goods; I often get messages a villager has no access to something when there are loads available at market stalls throughout the city.

I like that the game is less action focused and more of a relaxed experience with a focus of balancing alot of different types of resources.

Like you set up a mining operation to get iron ore.
Then you need a smelter to turn the iron ore into iron bars.
You then take the iron bars over to the blacksmith to turn the bars into tools.
Then the tools goes to the weaponsmith to make swords.
You then give your soldiers the swords and send them off on a military campaign for phat lewt.
And that general pattern repeats itself for something like 40 different resources.

Only thing Im missing would be some bigger maps and perhaps a map editor.

Painting the zone areas and allowing for layering is really useful. For instance you can layer extraction for wood cutting and reforestation. So you can keep your forests as a renewable resource and choose the trees you want your forester to plant. The entire experience is very organic, and relaxing.

As is the case with other city management simulators, there are a lot of things to keep track of, but it's not overwhelmingly intimidating (unless you make it that way for yourself). There are learning curves, but once you get the hang of raw resource/product flow management and laying the groundwork of the city layout in a way that keeps your villagers happy, it's incredibly rewarding to watch everyone scurrying around in 3x speed when you're swimming in gold, watching your people thrive.

I think my favourite thing I did on a whim that ended super well was at one point not building anymore resource production places for people to work, and instead enlisting every newcomer to my army. Now I have over 100 fully trained soldiers and a handful of knights, and I can just throw a bunch of them at any military mission I get and reap those beautiful, bountiful rewards. 

Now my only problem is that all my warehouses and granaries are full to busting. :) My only other qualm is that sometimes you get a notification that a ""villager path is blocked,"" and this sometimes renders a villager (or 5) just being... stuck. Like between a building and a shoreline. This causes their needs to plummet and your overall happiness stats go down because of that little handful of villagers who apparently can't just take a step to the left. But that's just part of the learning curve.

Overall awesome game, great fun time-sink, would absolutely recommend for folks who like city-builders (where, mind you, you don't have control over the exact placement of where villagers decide to build their houses) with a bit of resource management and plenty to keep an eye on to keep yourself occupied.",1651599396,1651599396,True,23,1,0.728264153003692627,0,True,False,True

Maybe I'm just a beginner, but I found the resource tracking and production line incredibly frustrating. For example, I had fully stocked fish but I was showing Food Shortage from my citizens because I needed to empty the Granary manually (?) But my fishing hut also had full fish, but wasn't distributing it to the marketplace, warehouse, or citizens? It seemed very counter-intuitive. 

Also I'm not sure if I like how technology progresses in the game currently (Raising people to citizens and gaining reputation etc.). Would be interesting if they just did a normal tech tree.

I'm hoping they do look at how all of this works eventually as I'm seeing a lot of potential for this game (UNIQUELY DESIGNED BUILDINGS, MODULAR Additions to major buildings), but for now it was a fairly enjoyable 8 hours (until it wasn't).",1651187489,1651187755,True,1,0,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,True

This game is amazing! Everything feels authentic and well organised.

The game is neither challenging nor deep, it has no special features and is much too relaxing and slow, at least in my opinion.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]The good[/h2]
- Incredible beautiful art, graphics and music!
- Very easy user interface
- Clever combination of traditional building placement and zoning (from SimCity-like games)
- The ability to customize key structures such as churches or the lords manor, I hope to see more of this!
- Roads/paths are created by the AI automatically, but you can restrict it by using the deny-zone. It really makes the town look more natural and less 'by design'.
- Sending out armies to distant lands (offscreen) is a very nice change of pace, instead of having to fight it out on your soil like in other games. I love this mechanic, very well made!
- Slow pace, easy to learn, the perfect game to relax with.
[hr][/hr]
[h2]What I hope to see added[/h2]
- A map generator would really bring this game to the next level
- More sea-focussed buildings, including perhaps tradeships that visits the town similar to the current trader
[hr][/hr]
[h2]The bad[/h2]
[i]It is early access, what is lised as 'bad' might be on the roadmap already[/i]

- The border of the maps need attention, so one does not luck 'under' the map when moving the camera
- The water could use attention, especially in the maps Coastal and Mountain.

Like it even has a section for it but there are no priests. That's just always annoyed me, but that's such a minor complaint. 

It would be nice if that when you finished unlocking everything that people wouldn't keep coming to your town and offering you tasks for the king and stuff when you have no reason to do so. Also It would be really nice if they fleshed out more towns to trade with since you can't trade around every item and you unlock each of the trading routes pretty quickly 

Get ready for your pc to be tested in the late game. It absolutely will chug but there have been updates that have significantly improved proformance and I must give them credit for that. I'm sure it's a technical nightmare to get it all running incredibly smoothly.

When you chop down trees there isn't an animation. The tree just disappears. Trees also only give 1 wood regardless of size. When someone other than your wood cutter chops down a tree, then it doesn't produce wood. It shouldn't just poof out of existence. The tree was chopped down, so give me the wood.

I would like to be able to do a little maintenance to my paths/roads. Currently, I have no say in their construction other than forbidding certain areas be walked through to ""destroy"" a path. 

Building on elevated terrain is very awkward. This game is called foundation, but I can't set up buildings to be on a stone foundation when they are on uneven terrain. It makes the buildings look very awkward when the doors don't line up correctly. I'd like to be able to lift up buildings and position their doors where I want. Being able to add some steps would be great too.

People completely clip through each other. It's not pretty to look at, but isn't a huge deal. Just a correction to not make them able to 100% be inside one another would be a great fix. 

This kind of game needs dynamic seasons and weather effects. Keeping your people warm during the first winter is an important event in this genre. Completely missing here from what I can tell. Haven't seen any snowfall. 

Needs a random map generator and is eventually getting one from what I hear. So that's good.

I'd like to see a greater variety in villagers appearances too.

Mods fix a lot of these things, but the base game should have them in my opinion. Foundation receives a soft recommend from me. Looks nice and feels good to play.

---------------------------------------------
Wow I am very impressed, they fixed many issues in the past years and the game is actually a lot of fun now. It also has some mechanics that are really new and cool.

- I love to paint the regions where people can do stuff

- UI is super clean and you can even scale it up without it getting blurry

- I love the ""build your own building from different parts"" part 

And to the guy that wrote ""Sounds to me like you have 0 patience, you're stupid or you're a troll"" - I have a lot of patience, I am not stupid and I am no troll. How dare you to insult me when I am just giving my honest opinion about a game? How can the devs improve without honest feedback? Greta wouldn't be pleased....


ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM 6. Okt. 2019
------------------------------------------------------
Absolute shit - Insta refund! 

Haven't refunded a game so quickly in a while.

- Game UI is super small and if you scale it up it's super blurry

- Because of the crappy UI design I was not able to build a woodcutter because I thought the position is not good to build. However it turned out I have built like 20 woodcutters by clicking around and could then manually destroy them again.

- Anyhow I was then not able to build my fereking woodcutter or the masonry... I was just not able... I had 4 people assigned to build stuff but they refused to build them. The ingame help didn't help either. 

- After figuring out how to tell my apple gatherer ladies where to gather apples they just gathered them once then did nothing at all.

Really devs what were you thinking? Go play some settlers again to see how to make a game fun.

The only good thing about the game is the main title screen. Eveything after that is crap.

The game is still being developed, and you can feel that some more work is needed. I'd like to know more about why my villagers are unhappy, for example. Parts of the game are a bit obscure for a first time player: some buildings are locked and it's not obvious how to gain access to them (ex: you can only build a fisher's hut after you've gained enough Splendor AND spent it on unlocking the hut)
You can choose to promote a number of your villagers every week to a higher level. If you rush this step, your most demanding villagers may leave because they cannot yet find the goods that will satisfy them. This is one of the main difficulties I found, the game overall is not too challenging, which is exactly what I want!
I love the pace of the game. Build enough to fill the coffers, buy a new tile in the map, keep developing the town and adding new industries... So far I haven't invested at all in an army, and I almost hope I won't have to, as I really love the city building experience. The fact that your villagers create their own paths makes the place look so adorable and real!
I hoped I would like the game, and I really really do.

Definitely not worth it at full price just yet unless you're the kind of person who likes throwing money behind concepts. I'd say it's worth AUD$25 max for what the game currently offers in terms of actual 'play', but even that's a bit of a stretch.

There's a lot of imbalance in the production chains (which relies on mods to fix) at present and it's just not very 'fun'. Nothing exciting happens and there's no actual purpose for playing. About the only thing that happens right now is you get ""bad weather"" which affects food harvests for a few months. That's it. While the game is supposedly based around organic and emergent gameplay, an awful lot of it feels like it's on rails and scripted to happen every X number of months. 

Some of what the developers have achieved is impressive, but the impressiveness is lost when it's not really contributing much fun to the overall gameplay and when it's still so rough around the edges. I can play these sorts of games for weeks on end, but I've found myself getting bored and putting this one down very quickly.

Building monuments isn't very 'fun' at present, with a lot of the parts feeling placeholder/lacklustre or just not really making much sense or having much purpose. To be perfectly honest, I would rather just plop down a single pre-made castle or church (like all the production buildings in the game) and research upgrades. I feel like the developer perhaps got a little tunnel vision with this feature and spent too much time on it while putting other more critical areas of the game on the backburner.

I can see what they're trying to do with the caste system, and I like it. It's a great idea and something we haven't seen implemented in this way before. But, like everything in the game, it still needs some figuring out. Promotions being arbitrarily tied to the beginning of each month (when your budget fluxes between full coffers and empty coffers in the span of a heartbeat) is a bit frustrating. I would find myself just sitting and waiting for a big trade to come in, pausing the game and spending all the money before it immediately hit zero and/or went back into negatives again. Not really very fun, and rather frustrating when the end of that first week is over and suddenly your coffers are back up to max because you made a couple of trades from the on-rails traders who happened to arrive at a warehouse within that week.

There's also lot that isn't really explained, such as why your sims are spending so much time taking a break from work when they're not actually fulfilling needs (it seems to be rather on rails - shouldn't they keep working if their needs are fulfilled?), as well as desirability of areas for housing and what constitutes an area as being desirable to build a house when weighed against distance from workplaces, etc. It's all a bit of a wild guess at the moment.

The game would also benefit from a lot more and varied info readouts being made available to the player, such as moving average production rate for buildings based on current input/output/resource issues, a breakdown of what's actually costing you upkeep money upon each tick of the calculations cycles. It would also be really nice if you could turn off trades and construction costs affecting the currency balance ticker at the top of the screen, as they cause such a disproportionate spike against the background values of market trades/upkeep that it renders this reading difficult to use as an indication of anything whatsoever. What we really want to see is the market/tax income as compared against upkeep/tax expenditure so we can make informed decisions about whether we can afford the upkeep on a big new project or whether we need to promote a few more people and rebalance goods production.

Trade routes are also extremely underwhelming at present - once you've unlocked them for a measly value, it just happens automatically and the amount the trade routes actually buy and sell to you seems random and unexplained. They also don't buy and sell all wares in the game at present, which feels a bit confusing and half implemented. Why not have more trade routes/options available, but just lower the value of everything so you've not got entire industries worth zero and some worth the moon? Definitely needs a re-think.

If the developers were to take some inspiration from games like Frost Punk, where the player actually has to make decisions which shape and guide the way their kingdom develops (for good or worse), it might move this away from being more of a technical demo and more into the realm of being a game. I feel that more impactful events would also take away from the developer's need to cap the player's currency reserves so low, as the player will need to stockpile (yet could also be caused to pay out) large amounts of currency to weather the ebbs and flows of these events.

Major buildings are built component-by-component by the player to tailor them to their need and the available land, But also to look impressive in order to generate the Splendor needed to unlock new buildings. All that boils down to good town planning: how do I have my villagers close to the churches and markets they need, while being close enough to their work (but not so close to suffer their ugliness)?

And this is what the game really shines; what could be called ludonarrative coherence. The things that _feel_ nice when playing are almost always the most _efficient_ way to play. It feels natural in a role playing way to have upper class citizens in the main urban settlements working high end jobs, while serfs toil in the fields in tiny outlying villages, and it's also a good way of running the in-game economy. I want my lord to live in an ornate manor with lots of high towers and large rooms, and the game mechanics reward me for doing so. Bigger churches are needed as your settlement develops, and the largest most decorated one will end up being in the central town square, just where I would want it. So many games in this genre require choosing between building a beautiful, realistic town and one that is efficient by the rules of the game; being able to do both at once is delightful.

Be aware, however, that despite having been in EA for 3 years the game is very unfinished, with only 60% of the raw content currently present according to the devs. Housing upgrading is a big part of the game according to the tutorial, but there are only 2 tiers currently in. There's no stone keep/castle. Some of the resource production lines are completely unbalanced. Villager path finding occasionally breaks. The UI is smooth and intuitive, but occasionally lacking in vital information or the odd QoL tool-tip.


All in all, if you want a medieval town planning game that blends beauty with efficiency, then you could do a lot worse than this. But if you want to play a complete game with all the content present, then you should wait. I think getting it when it's on sale and playing a run once every major patch or two is easily worth it.",1648039921,1648039921,True,2,0,0.50438302755355835,0,True,False,True

- [b]Organic village development.[/b] Honestly, they have nailed this. I don't know of any other game where the growth of your settlements feels so natural. Roads form simply by people using the same route continuously and houses are automatically built by your villagers. The complete lack of grids and highly customisable buildings means your village can become a giant sprawling mess lack an actual old town.
- [b]Peaceful vibes.[/b] It's possibly the most relaxing city-builder out there. The pace is very slow and there are essentially no threats. It's very hard for anything to actually go wrong. The audio is great as well, it really adds to the quaint, cosy feel
- [b]Cute sprites.[/b] The graphics are cartoon-like which I was initially unsure about but I've come to love following my adorable little villagers around. I'm really interested to see the upcoming addition of dialogue as I think this is something many city-builders lack and it can add so much more engagement.
- [b]Varied gameplay.[/b] There's all the normal stuff you'd expect like resource and worker management, production lines, trade etc but there are also a few other interesting mechanics related to how you align your policy and interact with other towns. This is going to be fleshed out further in the future, which it definitely needs but it adds a bit more interest than just building. 

[h1]Bad stuff:[/h1]

- [b]Difficult resource handling.[/b] Once your settlements get bigger, it can be quite difficult to move goods around efficiently and the AI can be dumb at times. However, the latest resource tracker update really helps with this.
- [b]Slow development.[/b] Personally, I think that they released this into EA too soon. When I first bought it, I only managed about 30 minutes before putting it down. The updates since then have been excellent however, they've just been slow at coming out. The developers are very active and I completely believe that they'll release a full version, I just think they're a bit optimistic with their timelines.
- [b]No end-goal.[/b] This is a problem for almost all modern city-builders. Once you've built everything there is to build, there is nothing left to keep you interested. There are small tasks to begin with that act as a tutorial but once you've completed them, you're just left with very repetitive radiant ""missions"". There is at least a a lot more scope for being creative compared to other games in the genre but a well built map and an engaging storyline keep me far more interested.

I don't honestly trust the software. When you exit the game, it will stay running on Steam until you force it closed. You can't even just use Steam's 'stop'-button to do this, either. I usually just shut down my whole system and regret playing.

For my part, I'm giving up. Before these devs disabled the forum, I was trying to appeal to them to change this. Instead, they disabled the forum. They made excuses saying it's Steam's fault, but how is it every other game I've got can handle something so simple?

Nah, they're probably having the game keep running because it's probable malware. The game is otherwise alright, but seems like they made it just alright and hypnogogic enough to support whatever else it's doing when it's running but you're not playing anything....

Don't buy this. I'm uninstalling it for good right now. Sad, because if it only had devs who weren't shady and actually cared enough to fix a problem, I wouldn't mind playing it once in a while. I waited long enough for the issue to be addressed.

Even if it's an early access game, it's already a good game. There's still a huge unused potential and it could definitely become a great game, maybe it could even redefine the genre. It's a beautiful looking grid-less ""organic"" game and it runs smoothly. To get rid of the grid makes everything better, welcome in 21st century! I'd personally like the idea of ""organic development"" to be pushed much more. I didn't encounter any bugs except when I was using mods. 

Some wishes:

The concept of ""organic development"" is extremely interesting but it still need some development and polishing in my opinion. There's a huge unused potential here.

""Organic paths"" are interesting but it can easily turn into a big mess net that prevents houses from being built. I'd like to feel I'm really the lord of the realm and to set some official streets/squares/whatever with the painter tool wherever I think it's appropriate. It'd also be nice to have an extension to the construction office to pave road and to set an area to pave with the painter using rocks. I'd also like pedestrians to avoid collision on paths so that some paths would dynamically become wider with use.

""Organic"" houses placement is also a mess sometimes. It looks good for a low density suburb area, but I'd like it to get naturally more ordered in a dense village center. I'd like houses to be encouraged to popup along existing paths and to gradually get organized into row houses, forming beautiful narrow medieval looking streets. I've started to use the free placement mod in order to get beautiful looking village center which spoils a bit the concept.

I'd also like the economy to be more ""organic"". In the current state, it's a very centralized and planned economy. Why not having ""organic"" free merchants, private artisans, shops, industries, letting people apply for a job freely, etc? The complex interaction of all this would add a lot of essence in the game. As the lord, I'd like to manage all of these free ""organic"" activities by setting Laws in the Great Hall. I'd like to decide with my laws if my realm will have more or less a very centralized or laisser faire economy.

The ""bad weather"" event is a bit frustrating. I'd prefer more or less static seasons with some meaningful weather events.",1646506706,1646506706,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I am changing my review to recommend. The game is enjoyable and the devs seem to care about improving it. I have come back to this game several times and each time I found myself having fun remembering the basics. Once you figure it out, there's not a ton of ""newness"" at the end game, but that seems to be a reality in all games to some degree. So, if you take the game for what it is and not expect too much pizzaz you will be rewarded with a solid game and good way to spend several hours. Note, I have had a few crashes at end game so perhaps there is a memory leak? But the game auto-saves so not a huge deal.

**Update** At 66.6 hours played -- I thought ""666"" was kind of funny, but it's true, and could be a perfect time to ""demonize"" the game, but I actually have happier news -- it's time for more insight into the game.  After running into lack-of-food wall 3-4 times and having the game become frustratingly, slowly ended, I have made food production my top priority as I gave the coastline map a try. I am currently over 500 population and my city/cities are much more stable and growing.

I still can't recommend yet, but mainly due to cost -- it's still a bit overpriced for what you get, especially considering the lack of content at mid-to-end game. However, I do like the combat missions and I have only had 2 crashes, which ain't bad.

The special projects that become available are very confusing and the written descriptions are not helpful. These are meant to be big projects that have substantial impact to aid you as you expand, but most of time, I end up making them and not meeting the requirements for the perks to kick in.

So, if this type of game interests you, I'd keeping following the progress as there is a solid core of a game here.

*Original review* I thought I'd The game is somewhat enjoyable at the beginning, but there are these walls you hit and then you just have to restart. The first few times the mistakes are kinda obvious and you learn so no biggy. But it keeps happening, just further and further into the game. It's always food related. At some point the food drops and you lose people, then money and then you just sit there watching all your effort go to waste. There's no quick fixes, so even though you have tons of items stocked up, you have no way of selling it and the trade routes just stop working or they run outta money to buy your items, I don't know exactly?

The last game I got to 400 population and completed all the knowledge trees so I'm finding it difficult to be motivated to start again. I kinda feel like I got to see the whole game and I don't think it was worth 20 bucks -- luckily I got it on sale. So, not a total bash, but just an honest feeling of the game not being worth the cost at this point, but hopefully they will keep working on it. Maps are pretty basic and not a ton of research or troop diversity. So, replay-ability isn't really that intriguing. I only had 1 crash so game is fairly stable.",1630570257,1646003466,True,0,0,0.521744728088378906,0,True,False,True

-End game isn't thought out too well. Population grows but it is just more of the same basic nonsense as early game.
-Quality of life and the living conditions based on the presence of industry effecting housing desire is idiotic. I can't imagine people of this era are that picky.

I left this review 8 months ago and decided to briefly return to the game this week to see what progress the developers have made... and I've decided to leave the review below unedited because nothing has been fixed. Gold and marble are still useless. Shortages persist despite an abundance of food and people to move it around, and figuring out why... is still obtuse (I tried poking around in the menus and found nothing). Common wares and candles are cool, i guess, but like... come on guys. Please, just get the logistical side of this game right. It's so frustrating. 

Despite the last update ostensibly being about better resource management and giving you better information... the problems I've had still persist. The game has some deep, core issues that make it fundamentally frustrating to play and the developers have been surprisingly light on details or timelines for when they plan on actually making any improvements.

I hope this game doesn't turn out to really be vaporware but I'm concerned we're heading in that direction.

I would keep away from this game for now. Hopefully I'll be able to have good news in the future but we'll see.

Review below:


I love building and management type games, they're my favorite by far (see how many hours I have in cities skylines lol) and I think Foundation is a winner given that it's still unfinished.

I'm playing after the 1.7 UI update and I've avoided the game up to this point because I wanted to wait until it had more content. There's a solid amount of it now, but there are some major issues still holding it back.

First things first, the gameplay is fun and very positive. I really love the ""organic"" urban vibe they're going for where people just kind of build their own houses in designated areas, not in the most efficient way necessarily, but in a way that feels like regular people just built the village and not some immaculate town planner like in a lot of other games. It's fresh, and I love the sense of realism it imparts into the game. I've enjoyed watching the little villagers with their goofy giant eyes scurry around town to deal with their errands and tasks.

However, at a certain point it seems (around the 180-200 mark) of citizens, it seems that the resource management just goes a bit haywire and the information the game gives you makes it incredibly difficult to figure out why. I frequently run into ""food shortages"" late game, even though markets are full, people have places to go, and I just can't seem to figure out why sometimes people don't go into taverns.

On my current playthrough tools have been a major shortage for some reason despite having a fully functioning iron mine, two smelters, and an abundance of coal, but for some reason the smelters are just not producing things because the resource management people are just... well, it's inefficient, for no real apparent reason. I have an abundance, but the shortages just persist and I can't for the life of me figure out why. This town is quite prosperous and large, and therefore is able to import tools at a significant cost... but for some reason, despite having two warehouses keyed into accept tools---they are not being imported. This means that all construction proceeds at a basically glacial pace while the smelters very slowly catch up to demand.

As if this weren't enough, resources that would ostensibly be incredibly valuable---like gold, have very little use except to be made into Jewelry. The problem though, gems are rare, and as far as I've seen there is no ""Gem"" mine, meaning you just have to get lucky when they randomly pop out of an iron mine or something. Golds only persistent use is to be made into jewelry but it's so rare that you end up with a giant glut of gold that nobody in the kingdom wants to buy. Why? In medieval times gold bars were the height of wealth and status and literally was just taking money from the ground because of how valuable it was. It's crazy to me that something like this has basically no use in the game.

The same goes for Marble, again, a very prized and valuable resource. Nobody wants to buy it. Its main use is in some specialized buildings and monuments, but when you have three deposits of it, you just end up with a massive buildup of the stuff and nobody can do anything with it. You can sometimes make sculptures, but again, not a frequent use so it just piles up.

The game has great bones but the resource management in general is in need of a major revamp. At least give players some better information so they can appropriately handle shortages---and give resources a purpose, either to be sold, or made into something.

Solid, but I might hold off a while longer on purchasing it until it's in a more finished state unless it's on sale.

Foundation is a relaxing city builder where planning and logistics lay at the heart of the gameplay. Similar titles would be the Settlers series, or even Cities Skylines. It can be quite unforgiving, in a good way, until you figure things out. Not as unforgiving as games like Banished can be - you'll usually be able to see where you're going wrong reasonably quick and start and try to remedy it before it's too late. 

The game is still in early access, which explains the lack of end-game activities. Once you've established your city and built all the buildings, there isn't much to do and things very rarely go wrong. The developer is regularly shipping new updates though, which gives you reason to return every few months and experience the newest additions.

The main gameplay loop is solid and the idea behind gridless medieval city builder is decently implemented. 

But the first place where the game fails is on the level of the player input: unwieldy camera controls which teleport you sometimes, chaotic default hotkeys assignement (e.g. ESC to open the main menu is not the default option and I haven't found it in the settings, control key is used for rotation, shift stops the camera motion instead of increasing the speed), many important actions have no key bindings at all. The game lacks any fresh maps or procedurally generated ones. The UI is uninspired and bland, it's made without any compassion towards new players - there's no useful tooltips, building menu is hidden behind the buttons one would usually consider being for something unimportant. Most buttons are also hard to recognise at a glance which is critical for a game with the focus on building.

Positives:
[list]
    [*] Every Villager is completely simulated, has a Work-Freetime cycle and you can follow everyone and see where he buys his food, where he gets his water and so on.
    [*] New Resource Tracker is helpful to see where goods are produced and used
    [*] Every Villager has some animation when at work
    [*] You can customize your Churches, Castles and so on
    [*] Very relaxing gameplay and not to easy but also not to hard
[/list]

Negatives:
[list]
    [*] Could have some more information e.g. Consumption rates of food and so on. Really hard to track when the initial overproduction of food ends
    [*] UI could present some information better.
    [*] after 10-15 hours you have seen and produced everything. You can still grow and beautify your city but thats not my cup of tea. Also in the future scenarios or a campaign would be nice
    [*] Production chains are not that complex as in for example Anno 1800 but you also cant influence them that much (e.g. limit production rates, ...)
    [*] The random events/tasks become pointless after a certain time. You dont need the rewards anymore and you have to decline every new task manually which can become annoying

It looks great! Really like the art style, love the landscapes and the music is nice. But beyond that it lacks a lot of substance. It feels like there’s literally nothing to this game unfortunately and 90% of my time in this game so far has been spent staring at the screen waiting for buildings to be completed while builders decide to take “free time” and I’m just left being able to not really do anything until a particular building is built (i.e. A Sawmill).

The gameplay is extremely slow, way too slow in fact and requires a lot of idle time from yourself just to wait for things to happen. Village population growth rate is also extremely slow as well as expansion.

Unfortunately in its current state I can’t really recommend this game to anyone but those who would like to sit and stare at their screen whilst basically nothing happens.

All I can say is I’m glad I bought it on sale but even then, the price I paid feels like it was too much for what this actually is currently. I understand it’s in early access, but from what I’ve read and seen so far it seems very little has happened with development over the past couple of years.

Foundation is a Medieval take on Sim City and as such it has some of the good gameplay elements, but a handful of the frustrating elements as well.

The Good: It's nice to see your city grow, to watch villagers upgrade their homes and flesh out your town.  Unlike Sim City however, you are given a (sometimes bizarre) name for each villager so that you can follow them from work to home, watch them shop etc.  This makes you feel a bit more connected to your settlement.

The Bad: There are a lot of gameplay mechanics that aren't very well explained through the in-game help function so you'll likely be querying quite a few things in the forums to keep you progressing.  While it's a minor thing, you can't move your villagers homes and they do tend to like to build them in a disorganised lump.  While this will only upset your sense of organising your town and building it on your vision,  

The Ugly: Your villagers, as helpful as they can be, the minute you promote someone beyond the rank of Serf, you're going to end up with constant demands for different foods, different goods and once you reach Citizens, they require luxury products as well.  Based on your villagers rank, their need for items will increase.  They will no longer be satisfied with just one type of food each day, they'll require two and the same goes for goods.

Promoting a villager to the rank of Citizen is honestly only worth it for the access you'll get to different buildings.  The main ones being the Tavern, Monastery, Candle Makers and Common Goods.  If you have Citizens you will require the Monastery and Tavern to sate a Citizen's need for luxury items.  Despite the fact that the only luxury item production facility (Jewelry maker) is the only thing available to you with one Citizen promotion, Gems are way too rare to make this a viable way to produce luxury items for your Citizens.  The only way to ensure a regular source of Luxury is to have the Monastery.  While the Tavern is a good option, the high level Monastery is the only way to really produce luxury items on a townwide basis.  Knights are considered Citizen's too with regard to their needs.

So while promotion is required to unlock all of the building items, as the game plays now, you won't want to promote anyone beyond the rank of Serf unless you're required to.  While a Serf is happy with one food item, Commoners and up require two, so if you have a village full of Commoners (this is the only rank at which villagers will begin to upgrade their homes), you will have to have huge amounts of goods and food resource creators or you will encounter a constant shortage of supplies.

So basically, while this game is a lot of fun, the lack of tolerance in higher ranked citizens for waiting for stocks to be replenished on a daily basis and the claims that they have no access to comfort (because their home is being upgraded), drains your own patience really quickly.  This is to the point where the promotion system is literally only used to unlock buildings as the work ethic of Commoners and Citizens is not as good as the Newcomer and Serfs who are harder working.

Hopefully they will consider modifying the promotion/rank system and the needs of villagers.  A day/night cycle would help the player keep track of the passage of time.  The ability to better control where your villagers decide to plant their houses down would be nice, such as the defining of pathways and 'roads' to be used by villagers to better structure your town generally.  Finally, the help guide needs to cover more information for the later stage gameplay options such as making a player aware of how regularly the tiers of villagers will require access to items.  How to access Blueprints.  Better construction options for Religious buildings and the Lord Manor so that in order to deal with your population and increased need for treasury funds, you don't end up with a building that looks like a haphazard blob as you're forced to add to it to accommodate everyone.

This looks like I hate the game, but I don't.  I do enjoy it but it does require quite a bit more fine tuning to really make it what they want it to be and to make it enjoyable for players beyond the initial excitement of being able to promote, upgrade and build an army.",1642683662,1642683662,True,5,0,0.576719582080841064,0,True,False,True

I cannot get over how quickly I fell in love with this game.

Generally speaking, the game takes a while to actually get used to, but you will slowly love it more and more.

Interface, shortcuts, structures and gameplay changes have really improved a lot. A lot of mods are available, including the Fiery Essentials (for the non-official sandbox mode). The game can be demanding for the player if you want to advance quickly and complete all possible objectives. But you can also play it slow and steady, allowing for a long term experience.

Once you unlock your keep and put in some soldiers money is never going to be a problem anymore, which is boring. If you have half a brain then you should be fine on food as well and once you have the production chains set up, your storage capacity will be the limiting factor until you might reach a high enough population so you will actually have shortages.

I would advise the creators to do a review on the production chains and balance the outputs a bit more so you actually need to choose where to put your people to work. Instead of having to build 1 grain farm, 1 windmill and 1 bakery until you hit probably 200-300 population, you might want to decrease the output so you need to have a second bakery much earlier.

Not having to build roads or put housing down is just so much gameplay easily done away with.  If you're like me and trouble about the placement of every building and road, Foundation is wonderfully freeing.   The city builds up organically with lots of charm.  Once some of the quirky aspects of the game (such as how building 'parts' work along with the build menu for each building), your city is quite easy to get rolling. 

Foundation is a pure sandbox, at the moment at least.  There are no survival aspects or diplomacy issues, no catastrophes to mess with your building plans.  A relaxing, if not terribly challenging game. 

Most city builders make building houses the fulcrum of the game.  Without houses, you don't have citizens or a birthrate, without an expanding citizenry, you can't expand the infrastructure needed to support them.  A true tail-chaser design that almost all city builders employ as you delicately balance a careful expansion of your citizens to expand your infrastructure to expand your citizen base.  Miscalculate and the whole comes tumbling down.  That's the core game play of almost all city builders no matter what environment or challenges they present.  

Foundation does away with all that by having you designate residential areas wherein your citizens build their own homes, expand their own homes and upgrade their own homes as they see fit without your having to micromanage housing one bit.  You have the power to promote them to greater level of needs (newcomer, serf, commoner, citizen) that you must plan for, but so long as your citizens are happy, more and more will immigrate to your city, allowing you to expand and build as long and as far as you like.  

All and all I found this a very enjoyable game.  

There are downsides.  The bigger your realm gets, the slower construction becomes, which makes the early gameplay much more satisfying and immediate, while later gameplay plods along unnecessarily.  The Splendor mechanic is not explained and it takes a while to understand how it works and how to get it, which is fairly simple.  The Masterpiece monument construction is not explained and seems pointlessly arcane. 

Trade in the game works very well early on, but is too limited later in the game, with only 3 or 4 trade partners and no way to expand trade past that.  

The war mechanic is repetitive, but works fine for acquiring Kingdom splendor (through building Keeps), money and goods (by going on missions) and as a convenient dump for excess citizens by turning them into soldiers. 

Foundation core gameplay is excellent, but it desperately needs a connection to the greater world.  Looking back at the classic Sierra city builders, a wharf that connects to the unseen world, buys up your excess goods and brings hard to find items might be just the thing.   Builders slightly more concerned with doing their jobs with dispatch would certainly make the later parts of the game go far more quickly and with greater satisfaction.  

Considering the solid and off the grid gameplay, this game belongs in any city builders library.",1641860683,1641860683,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The biggest problem is that stuff just crawls to a near stop once you have a large population. Builders are assigned in absolutely horrible ways, resulting in build times and overall travel times for population that see them lose all their happiness on their way to work. This seems to be near impossible to avoid without ridiculous amounts of micro management. 

Other than that it plays like a lot of similar games from the later years. Lacks polish and challenge levels are not really great. It feels like a game that needed another year of polish just to get the small stuff right, adding a few more options for building the keep etc. But that is all OK, the insanely slow late game isnt.

Ok, so I can almost certainly say that most people won't have this profound of an experience but, for me, Foundation really DID significantly improve my life. I've been in an emotional slump in life lately, another bout of anhedonia caused likely from a blend of ADHD, stress, and cyclothymia. I bought Foundation from my wishlist due to my interest in both medieval settings and RimWorld. Foundation seemed like another of the games that have managed to give me life recently: Timberborn. I've always enjoyed city builders and had an itch for building... something. 

When I launched the game, I grinned to myself, more earnestly than ever in my recent memory, when I saw the ""Good news everyone!"" Futurama reference announcing a patch. I was enjoying the visuals and menu, but that made me really start paying attention to the little things. If this person put that attention into a simple patch note, the dev(s) were worth my full attention. 

Then I got into the game and had to pick my land. It was a very nice land. I could see the Valheim influence that is everywhere lately, and the other city builders and community survival games were here too. So, heartened by the fun little joke on the last screen, I selected a little area by the coast to live. As I hovered my mouse over, I noticed what I was actually picking was a district. ""Huh, that's interesting"", I thought. I had seen systems like this in another genre I love: the biz sim. I was taking a break from Little Big Workshop recently, but saving up with the goal to purchase more factory territory tends to be a goal I typically love to work towards. So, I was happy again. 

I picked my spot, giving this game infinite buy-in and suspension of disbelief for a few moments. If I was plowing forward like I tended to lately, in other games, I might have picked something more dramatic. Instead, I wanted to give this game a REAL shot and didn't want my town to fail. Instead of the cliffy island, I picked a gently rolling forest glen by the beach. Almost insufferably ""new player"" flagged in my scrutinizing mind, but I was happy to be a new player in this game, for once. I was happy. (This is the core of immersion, folks! Not graphics.)

My town got it's little shipment of colonists, like so many other games. Right away, I appreciated every little design feature. The aesthetics of this game are spot on for what they're targeting, imo. Cartoony, but not so much that it's fully abstract. Again, like a Valheim or other colony sims. As I was going through the initial quests, which are like guidelines in bowling (The perfect level of tutorial, imo), I was poking around the features and buttons. That's when it REALLY hit me: This dev team knows what's up. 

I noticed the trade mechanics of Caeser 3, in my top 10 games of all time. I noticed the Skill building by doing of Rimworld, a game with over 4000 hours played (at least 2000 were actually at my PC, unpaused!), I noticed the 'skill tree' unlock system of buildings from... yes, something even more obscure: SimCity Societies. Yes, the red-headed stepchild that no one wants to talk about in City Building... except for me! Desire paths! Citizens with their own lives who make their own decisions on where to live! AN ACTUAL, FUNCTIONAL, SYSTEMS-DRIVEN GAME! HALLELUJAH!

I don't know that the devs played the same games I did and still do occasionally to try to rekindle that enjoyment, but it seems like it. And they're not just serving up what I know I like already, they're learning the lessons that the devs of those older games were pulling on, and crafting their own unique-recipe dish. I don't know if they thought of that bizarre experiment of Sim City Societies, but they DID know why I, personally, love that game. They are pulling on simply good, fun game design principles. Ensuring no two games are exactly alike. Tuning into what drives motivation and interest in the dopamine-starved and seeking brains of gamers. This is clear to me, with no outside knowledge whatsoever of  Polymorph Games, that they GET IT. They can read between the lines and DESIGN something with confidence and authority... and succeed. So few can anymore.

THIS is what I remember video games actually being like! ACTUAL player driven goals to set, progress, and payoff/accomplish! Actual reasons to RUN the simulation besides simple effectiveness! Some degree of mystery and faith (Letting the algorithm take the wheel) in a game, FINALLY! ALL of the things that got me INTO gaming, but are SO SO SOOOO hard to find these days, where any yahoo who watched the 45m seminar on monetization, 2hr tutorial on blender and unity, and access to a credit card for an asset store can release these so-called ""games"" that are more like eating a candy bar: Fun for exactly as long as it takes you to unwrap them and stuff them into your mouth, then unfulfilling, empty calories you'll forget by the next day. 

THIS game, from everything I'm seeing in ONLY 30 MINUTES is a real damn MEAL. And I have not been nourished (by anything that wasn't due to nostalgia) in a long, LONG damn time. If and when the devs add more, when mods are a flourishing ecosystem like Rimworld, and when I've had all that I can stuff myself with but know I'll come back for more later, I think this may be one of my favorite games of all time. For now, all I can REALLY say is that is IS worth your time and money to at least consider. 

And the reminder that there are still artists and creatives out there in games (And not just story tellers. Indie gaming has a great set of authors and story tellers, but actual GAME DESIGNERS are a VERY limited resource in the industry. Real systems-fungineers like the minds behind the original Civ and Sim games) is very heartening. This game made me feel like a kid trying desperately to upgrade just a few more homes into the patrician class before running out to catch my bus to school in the mornings. And missing it half the time, when I was a young boy in the late 90's who had no idea that a 32yr old with a recent adult ADHD diagnoses will be thinking about him, and remember this time as some of the best in his life, in 2022. And that, my friends, is a rarefied, authentic experience that this work of gaming art has evoked in me and I never expected it. 

Maybe I'll start up that programming class again. I thought games were over, but I have hope for a new dawn once again.

Since then there seem to have been significant improvements to the rougher areas of the game, and it is more enjoyable and polished now. 

There is still some way to go until this early access title is ready for full release, but things are shaping up. 
I'm pleased to see all the issues they already have addressed, and I'm excited to see where the  game is going.  

The organic building is refreshing change from the über-organized squares you all too often see in other games, and the monument system allows you to personalize your castles, inns, or churches. 

I'd say it's good value for the current discounted price, and maybe even the full price if this is the kind of itch you need to scratch.

My current concern for the game is the staying power as it seems to become less interresting around ~300 villagers worth. There's just less to strive for besides growth for the sake of growth.",1641135914,1641216681,True,3,0,0.535416901111602783,0,True,False,True

The underlying idea behind this game is something we've seen before but there are a few subtle ideas buried in there which really makes it stand apart from other building games. The ability to build anywhere, even on hillsides means that you really can exploit a region and not feel cheated by some arbitrary limits. The building models react to the changing terrain intelligently and it all ""feels"" good. That paths aren't defined by you and instead emerge naturally by the foot traffic of your people - feels incredible to see and over all it really feels like you are tending to and nurturing the organic growth of a little community. 

I have several issues with the game which put me off, at least for now. The first is the UI. Dear lord does the UI really let this game down. Over all the game is visually satisfactory, but there are aspects of this game that, on closer inspection, betrays an amateurishness. The UI is the most obvious and frustrating example of this and it would be the very first thing I would recommend they fix. It is functional, but there is little not no underlying UX methodology. It's ugly, full of redundancies and cluttered. 

The in-world, territory brush system is clumsy, lacks finese and could really do with being simplified and made more attractive. The modular construction is a great idea, however, again... it feels clumsy, clunky and convoluted, in part due to the substandard UI, but also the manner in which it depends on resources to complete. Requiring up front costs to constructions that really should be handled piece meal instead. It offers a lot of costumization in these constructions, which is great... but these should be treated with an additive approach rather than a compound, packaged manner.  

The audio is great. The music gently carries you along and provides a soft, whimsical backdrop for your experience.

Like I said I will most likely be returning to this game closer to it's completion... but as of right now the edges are too sloppy for me to feel comfortable dropping almost 30 dollars on.

Positives:
- It has a very organic feel to how you build things with roads and houses being built by your citizens.
- The game is cute and pretty, the UI is (mostly) good and clear
- The buildup is (mostly) paced in a meaningful manner
- Building the churchers, halls, taverns, etc... is fun

Negatives:
- The game is very, very easy if you are used to town builders
- The bottleneck (for me) was immigration, I could not get people fast enough to fill my buildings. So I was ""artificially"" slowed down
- The tutorial is alright, but some things are not explained or intuitive (the small stone outcrops don't run out, neither do the berries; no idea where the boars are,...)
- Very few building options
- Weird economic choices, 1 miller is enough for 3 full farms, but you need 1 person per type of food you sell
- Lack of events make the game predictable and easy
- Little reasons to build up your army or wall of the city as is

It's early access, so maybe there will be added content, but for now it's a bit lacklustre

There are a few really good maps out there, and also some really good mods for workplaces and for building really nice castles. I also like that on the Build toolbar, there is actually a button for items from mods that gives you a quick way to see what is from a mod and what is not. It would be nice if they would take the mod building items out of the regular build buttons and have sub-menus for them in the primary build button tho, but that would mean the modders would need to link them to a proper sub-category. It would also be nice if the mod map makers would put an actual proper definition and screenshot of the map so you can tell what is what with downloaded maps. That's not the companies' fault, but just lazy modders. One other note on mods, keep an eye on the posted and updated dates of them.

As a builder game goes, the graphics are nice and the world mechanics work well - in the beginning. But you quickly get to the point where you cannot do anything anymore. It takes less than a days play to do that, once you understand the mechanics of the game.

I'm a sim player - from Civiliation, old SimCity, ""Cities: Skyline"", Dawn of Man, Banished and many many more. I do not do multi-player games, the games are used as a distraction to allow me to focus on less important things in life - for a while.  Simulation games are great at that, as you get to the ""just one more"" mode as you focus on how to move things forward, how to solve a particular problem - and you even find yourself thinking of the mechanics and possibilities even when not in game. That's a good simulation game - it keeps on giving, with hundres (thousands) of hours spent in game getting just the right result. And you can visit your favorite builds and move on.

Unfortunately, Foundation is no such game. Like Planetbase and Dawn of Man (both Indie games) once you get the hang of the mechanics, it's easy to build a world that within 8-10 hours of game play just will not go any further. All achievements done, no more ""quests"", the world runs out of space, you cannot expand because the limited land/resources of the game come to fluition very quickly.  Of course those limits make the game playable without a lot of compute resources so it's understanding why the game developers want these limits, but in this case that limit is reached within 8-10 hours of play - probably less if you really have a hang of the game.

In this game, you have to get used to a very odd user-interface. Not all interaction in the game is intuitive. My platform is Linux, it runs well here (using Proton) but I do not get why rotating has to be done without a mouse button, but only can be done by holding the RIGHT ctrl button down (left CTRL does not work - if you try to remap the keys, it's 100% ignored).  Access to resources is very inconsistent - depending on what kind of resource, you either have to create a zone, or just build something ""close by"" (what-ever that means), or send a ""investigator"" to a random area because nope, you cannot tell what kind of resource the land has - that would make too much sense. In some cases, you have to build a building to get a chance to mark land for use using zoning. Why this works that way, but when you create a hunter you have to first create a zone, then build a building - I have no clue.

This is ""early release"" - as an early release game it's rather complete. I didn't find features listed that weren't implemented, the graphics looked complete if you ignore you can move your camera outside the area and see the polygons. It's relatively easy to see the icons once you're used to them and their meaning. But that's where it ends. The game mechanics are VERY simple. Only one crop type, only one ""hubs"" for brewing, location for these areas really doesn't matter, you don't need water near by or anything. Even mountain sides seem to work just fine for wheat.   So once you have access to a resource, just make sure storage is available and when it comes to food, you need stalls to sell it (because why wouldn't you ask those who did the work to pay for the privilege to consume it?), and that goes for goods too.  Makes no sense to me - but it's important in order to get income so you can expand the area and buy favors.

There's a trading system that definitely need some work. You get 3 types of trading routes that needs to be enabled first (which requires resources). Once enabled, the SAME trader will travel selling/buying exactly the same things ALL the time - boy do I miss Banished and it's very broad trading system that with extensions can get even more complex.  Worse, the traders can only purchase very small quantities. You very very quickly build up hundreds of wood/boards but when the trader finally comes he can buy 20 or 30 TOPS sometimes less.  To compare to Banished, unpatched you have no idea what will be on the trader vessel when it arrives. Once arrive you can request resources for next visit, and you can set what should automatically be sold/bought on arrival. And you decide what goods to stock in exchange for goods you want. Here, none of those choices exist. It's the same 5-6 types of goods being bought and the same 5-6 goods being sold. The only difference is, that each of the 3 trade routes have different things they want. But they always want the same stuff - so much for basic supply and demand mechanics.

In the early release, building higher only provides one addon feature - more points that you use to purchase new benefits with. So accumulate a lot of stone, lumber and tools and build a 20 story church or keep and you're basically set for the rest of the game. Yeah, they could really build skyscrapers back in those days. But those ""rooms"" or towers that you build this way have NO extra capacity - except for the one used for the treasury.  This means you accomplish everything you need realitvely fast and run out of new features. Once you randomly find the required resources to move on (and it doesn't look like those will exist in all game environments) it's pretty much done - except you won't have space to build housing on, as the land that does exist is too far away for the ""citizens"" to be happy, but if you build it too close it's low desirability and no high level citizens will live there. There's two very high ""I want to live close to this"" components in the game, but they are limited to one instance each - once build that's it.  I presume you could plan the game and build those in an empty area only used for citizens but that will be land you cannot afford early on.

Other ""early adopter"" issues are that hosing is placed VERY randomly - and it will happily block the entry on one house by placing others in front of it.  All other buildings except for housing, you control (with the wierd rotation setup I mentioned earlier) but not housing. That's a zone you make and houses are just randomly plugged in there and when they upgrade and get larger, houses will overlap with each-other or other  things near by. Seems a consistent model where you just place the housing yourself like you do with every other building, and make the footprint large enough to hold the upgrade so you cannot place small houses too close that they cannot upgrade without conflicting with others. 

So the TL;DR version is, that if you're new to simulation this is a fantastic introduction. The written guide will help you understand how to think and the number of attributes you have to know about is very limited. There will be challenges finding/understanding them all, but it's a very small set compared to other simulation and puzzle games. Just don't pay full game price - the current price point is WAY too high. This games has less than half the features of Banished which sells for a fraction of the price of Foundation.",1640370408,1640370408,True,359,1,0.958279728889465332,2,True,False,True

But here are some problems. 
Within 6 to 8 hours, you have reached end game. And mid/end game is buggy af. 
Resources you don't need, can't trade or are just bugged. Half or more resources are like that. 
Housing is terrible af.
Some buildings don't work.
The tech tree is laughable. You can be done in 4 hours. Maybe even less.
Customization of the big buildings is very limited. A really big disappointment.
You kinda are buying a half ass game, also buggy, but it's in early access so I let that 1 slip for now.
It's 30 euro's, so ye you should expect a half ass game though.

Edit: Tried after more then half a year again. Most bugs gone
Trading still sucks ass. Stockpiling everything like there is no tomorrow. I say ""sell, above a certain value"". Nothing happens. And still most of the resources you can't sell and is just there...

Good part, they add a decent amount of customization to the big buildings, so that was fun. Housing is better as well. If they can do some with the trading, then this game has potential.

So often I found myself happily working on expanding/growing my city only to run into a broken game mechanic that completely derails and negates all the time I spent working on the village.  More than once builders would not bringing the supplies needed to finish a building with no way to resolve the issue other then scrap the building and try building it again.  Or my warehouses are not condensing or merging inventory when I am instructing them to consolidate or accept certain supplies.  Far too often supplies would just disappear out of the warehouses/granaries. It seems that the game's... micro-logistcs (for lack of a better word) needs to be fine tuned.  Because there is no direct way for me to tell a villager to move this stack of supplies to this area (the way games like RimWorld do) we are left hoping that the AI can parse out how to micromanage everything.  Sadly, Foundation's AI is far too buggy in that regard.   Foundation removes the need to micromanage each person's actions which is a relatively unique game feature.  But there is, as of yet, not an acceptable game mechanic that handles the micromanagement.

Nov. 4th 2019 - Having come back to edit my review after giving Foundation more play time I am still hopeful that the bugs are being worked on.  There was a recent Fall update but I do not see that the key bugs (at least the ones that I continued to come across) were addressed in this update.  STILL far too often an issue arises that involves resources not going where they are supposed. i.e., my iron ore was not being picked up from the warehouse to be turned into iron even though I had a working and staffed iron smelt workshop right next to it.  The only solution anyone on the game's message board and discussion is tear down the problem building(s) and rebuild them. Aside from this being a massive waste of resources and time it maybe resolves the issue 30% of the time.  This would be negligible if I only had to do this every once in a while but as your city grows you will come across this more and more... and more... and more... often going a half hour or more before you realize that something is wrong and resources are bottlenecked somewhere - the clothes maker has maxed it's 50 shirt storage and for no reason those shirts are not being picked up by the market merchants or warehouse workers.

Foundation is definitely a game I will continue to revisit every so often to see what progress has been made. But, my opinion still asserts there are FAR too many bugs to merit the $30.  They are off to a great start but have A LOT of work before this game is worth that price.

Dec. 20th 2021 - any game that is still in ""early access"" on Steam for 2.5+ years did something wrong.  The Foundation that came to Steam 1,052 days ago is not that different from the Foundation that we have now.   It should be 1,052 days better and improved upon. Given that amount of time, every. single. problem/bug/mechanic/AI issue should be running close to perfection and the game should be out of ""early access"".

WHY SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME? It is a fully simulated city building strategy game. The villagers actually go to the market to eat. The material is actually mined and move across the map by actual villagers. Villagers actually go to work, take breaks, go home, go to buy clothes, etc. Your job is to place the buildings, assign the villagers jobs, buy territory, manage your military, manage trade relations, customize your city, etc. The game has actual supply chains from the raw material to the finished products. Plus, this game keep it fun without heavy micromanaging

Recently (update 3.8.1 on December, 17, 2021) this game has become much more fun to play and in-depth. Some features are still in their early works like the military system. Although, the primary features such as the actual village building and the supply chains are well fleshed out. Plus, the resource tracking feature is a much needed addition.

The UI still needs a few additions, but the updates have made in worlds better than before.

This game has a very bright future. Even in its current state, this game is definitely my favorite city building strategy game. The supply chains are realistic and actually make sense. You must build your village from just a village center to a sprawling metropolis. It gives you plenty of freedom to build how you like.

How It Plays:
First you start by choosing your starting territory, then you place your village center. Next you must place buildings, assign villagers jobs, and begin harvesting your local resources. Next, you build more building to convert those raw material to useful material such as stone to polished stone and wood into planks. Then, you begin taking those finished material into working products like swords, clothes, churches, and everything your villagers need to thrive.

Eventually you will look at your village and see a metropolis that expands across the entire map and realize you have sunken dozens of hours building your perfect village.",1576512074,1639802698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I opted to watch from afar to observe what degree of care the developers would bestow upon the title prior to making my purchase. After waiting well over a year before buying, I quickly snagged the title and logged nearly 20 hours into [i]Foundation[/i] almost immediately. Overall, I must say that I am pleasantly delighted and highly optimistic regarding this title. 

In short, the developers have constructed a “three-and-a-half X” game; the primary focus resting upon “expand” and “exploit.” A number of features are clearly still being fleshed out, but the core city-building aspect is firmly in place.

[b]What the game does right:[/b]

- The overall tone of the game is consistent and its graphical direction is superb.

- The music is exceptional. Being that the game lends itself to longer play sessions, the addition of a few more varied tracks would be enjoyable, especially if themed with events. 

- The construction and customization of “piecemeal” buildings. The current system allows for a great deal of creativity, with players able snap on doors and extensions and decorations with ease. All of this is implemented without too much complexity or an unrealistic learning curve. 

- There are many subtle features which are underplayed but show a great amount of care and detail. This includes concepts such as being able to customize the tone, pattern, and ring of the church bells, the slow formation of paths as villagers traverse, the return of the swords of fallen soldiers, and the ability to customize the inscriptions on constructed monuments.

- [i]Foundation[/i] is fun. Immediately after installing the game I burned far too many hours in a single session. This is the most important aspect of gaming and it is a sign that the development team is on the right track.

[b]What needs improvement:[/b]

- The villagers. [i]Foundation[/i] shouldn’t become “The Sims,” but it would be nice to see more development of the townsfolk. Marriage, reproduction, and a little more consistency regarding housing would go a long way. Also, the ability to favorite and/or follow different characters would be great. More outfits would also be appreciated. (Edit: Also, there is currently no easy way to tell which villager is leaving your town when the notification appears).

- The trade system. While functional, it is also rudimentary. Allowing the development of trade routes would be ideal, as well as adding more advanced factors (likely regarding diplomacy) would do wonders regarding immersion.

- Detailed data. More in-depth strategic information should be accessible. There needs to be a good way to see supply lines (and control them), as well as overarching, detailed data about what items are selling, to where, to whom, etc. 

- I will not extensively critique the UI system (as a major overhaul is current slated for the next update) but will note that finding the necessary information is generally easy. The menus are workable but could be prettier (and more in-line with the graphical flavor) and slightly more intuitive. As to the former point, better data integration would be useful.

- The production buildings. There needs to be a better way to upgrade existing buildings, as well as additional graphical variation for when multiple locations are needed. It grows frustrating that I can only have one shepherd at a sheep farm and can never upgrade.

- Combat. Earlier, I referred to [i]Foundation[/i] as a ""three-and-a-half X game."" Right now, the combat system consists of “send your soldiers off-map to fight for the king and see if they win and return with a reward.” A tooltip mentions that soldiers will help prevent robberies, so I can only assume that the developers have more planned in this regard. Needless to say, the ability to upgrade weapons and actually defend your town would be ideal. 

- Events. As of this review, the only “event” is a few months of bad rain (resulting in a 50% reduction of crop yields). This is either inconsequential or will catch players during a window of transition/promotion where food is already scarce. For the most part, there aren’t many things to look forward to once the all buildings and blueprints have been unlocked. The game needs to provide more goals during the mid-late stages.

- Bugs. Every game has them and it is no surprise here. But the fact that villagers often get “stuck” in their own homes or can’t reach their worksite even after months of consistency is frustrating. Sometimes resources will be shown as “unavailable” on the building menus even while they are currently sitting in a nearby warehouse. A few tooltips and tutorial items could be better-written and more clear.

Ultimately, [i]Foundation[/i] is exceptional in its present state, but the fact that it is already such a fantastic project essentially demands improvement. It would be a shame to let [i]Foundation[/i] sit as-is when the potential exists for it to become one of the greats.

I look forward to seeing how the ultimate product turns out; I have a great deal of faith in the development team from what I've already seen.

End of  2021 Update: While the promised UI update came a little bit later than expected, it was indeed worth the wait. Much of the more cumbersome elements have been remedied, and certain actions have been given more clarity.

The mechanics are quite similar otherwise: assign workers to jobs, workers produce goods, workers need homes, workers buy goods.  You want an efficient village where everyone has work, their needs met, and a place close to work they can call home.  Certain buildings have a customization system which allows you to assemble various building parts together to create custom layouts which increase their capacity or add extra functions to them.

I think I'm reaching the point where I've got someone doing just about every job and I have a good equilibrium where my villagers are never starved for resources and my cash flow is always positive, which is about the point where I tend to put down a game like this, but I can see myself picking it back up again later to try out a new strategy or after an update is released, much as I previously did for Banished and I still do for Cities Skylines and other builder games I enjoy.",1638083008,1638083008,True,18,0,0.721852362155914307,0,True,False,True

- Most gameplay is centered around middle-game, with start being quite slow and end-game being trivial.
- Means to address the ""services"" need do not scale at all.
- Many masterpiece bonuses are already obsolete once they can be built.

My only issues are whenever my village reaches a population of 1000 or more things start to fall apart. The game seems to also get pretty buggy when your village gets to that size. I think there are quality of life issues that need to be addressed. For example I would like to be able to assign warehouses or granaries to specific buildings to keep a good balance of product throughout my village. There comes a point in the game where for example no matter how many berry picking huts you put down your berry stock will always be too low to satisfy the needs of the people. I think the pathing of villagers also needs to be looked at as things get more and more inefficient over time. Repathing should be able to happen naturally or if there was a tool made for the player to help a villager find a better path. The forbidden zone paint brush can only do so much and it can become a headache when your village gets large. It would also be nice to have a building relocation tool as an option especially for villagers who build their houses in awkward locations.

I think the trade system between other kingdoms needs a serious makeover. Also I would like to be able to see the production and consumption rate of buildings so I can better balance the needs of industries. Once your village is large (1000+ people) it seems if even one resource production gets off balance a chain effect starts and everything will plummet and your village becomes bricked. I've probably had 7 or 8 1000+ villages so far and they spiraled out of control at about the same point.

If the developers continue on their path of adding to the game and tweaking things here and there I think this will become a better and better game over time.

I like the custom buildings and such. I would like to custom every house in the village if it was up to me.

UPDATE:
Okay I have played with the new Interface now more and it's growing on me. I resized it smaller and it has some new quality of life improvements I didn't notice first. So I think it's an improvement now.

UPDATE 2: 
I have completed every masterpiece and had over 500 people in a village without mods and I can edit my review a bit. 
I think this game is just ...magnificent. Time just flows by when playing and all the micromanagement is so much better now when I realized how to balance my budget better. Only things I kinda want to change is getting gems and gold earlier. I found gold in the last deposit in the map and it bottle necked me quite a bit getting couple of the better masterpieces to get the last trade route open to buy gems. 
Also my markets were bugged for a while. I had nearby food in store but my market tenders didn't go get it for some reason. Couple of my citizens just left because my markets were empty of food and goods. I had over 2000 bread, 400 cheese and 200 berries in the granaries. Only when I built 5-6 more granaries the market tenders fixed themselves and they worked again.

After letting this game rest for a long time (over a year), I returned to it with high hopes, which were sorely disappointed. I no longer feel like recommending it. The progress the devs made in is ridiculously small. Yes, some of the most glaring UI faults have been fixed, but a lot of others are untouched, and all the old issues with building still exist. Fort, church, and Lord Manor building parts all feel disjointed and don't fit together. Building a (non-rustic) church is absolutely frustrating, far too expensive in upkeep and no decent expansions which provide enough space to villagers, sometimes resources are carried there one by one, so it takes 50 runs or more. Creating symmetric buildings often fails because of some obscure rules for which snap points are disabled. Build the fort a bit too far away from your village and it may take forever. Even though the fort was started, it just keeps waiting for builders, which get there sporadically. The houses still spawn in horrible spaces, and may block each others exits when upgrading (just let us place them manually, for heaven's sake!). The overview screens have been improved overall, but still get completely unwieldy after a while. No good way to optimise your worker travel distances without endless and finicky micro-management. Lots of things are (unnecessarily so) trial and error, like how big the wheat fields should be. 

First impressions (out of date): Great gem of a game. First one of its kind (gridless freeform) I've played. While the UI still needs a lot of work, I love the many windows you can open to keep an eye on proceedings. Zooming in and swivelling the viewpoint allows for beautiful views of your village, it's an aesthetic pleasure. There is little to no guidance for production chain ratios, and it's pretty hard to figure them out without dedicated investigations. Prospecting mineral deposit takes ages and you can get quite hindered in progress by the absence of a gold deposit, but I guess in total there are not quite enough events/influences to make repeated game starts more interesting and different to the previous one. Some icons (food/goods) are too small. Building bridges is finicky. There should be an overview of distance between work/home location for all your villagers and a mechanism to move a villager into a house closer by. The devs say there will be no on-the-map battle (you're just able to send soldiers on automated out-of-the-map missions) - I would suggest working towards it for a later release and making it configurable (peaceful/warlike mode).",1595876051,1637107922,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I got this game because I am obsessed with all things city builder, management, and creative. Foundation for the most part provides those 3 essentials for me.

-Pros-
1) no grids-this is huge! I use to hate games without grids, but this game does it right! This feature is extremely helpful given that the villagers build their homes wherever they want (which is a con for me...)
2) there's no limit to how many of a certain building you can build (really helpful when your wheat farm is slacking so you build more)
3) being able to rename everyone and every building is amazing
4) i love the wedges and the small amount of decor you can place (too much decor and you would nearly feel like you're playing SimCity)
5) i like that it has a challenging aspect although the game remains extremely easy (the bad weather is the only decent challenge in the game)
6) the ability to have mods is nice although i would prefer more detailed DLC's from the developer (i have not downloaded any mods, i am more into DLC's)

-Cons-
1) starting the game for the first time and reading through the hints, you feel like you got it. Nope! I had to do research many times to figure out key things that i needed information on that wasn't mentioned in the hints)
2) i dont like that villagers build their own homes and wherever they want. This really messes up many plans i have for a certain layout with my buildings that i am going for. The comfort need should be our responsibility to build their owns, furthermore making the difficulty more in the game as people scramble for wood and other necessities to build them. (the higher the person, the more in depth of materials needed for their more prestigious home)
3) getting money in the game is mainly for when you are starting out and needing something from traders. Some items require weekly costs but i still find i have loads of money and no where to spend them. Traders aren't selling me items anymore so there's that.
4) those darn roads disappear on their own-yikes! it takes forever-there should be a tool remover for them
5) not enough maps! theres only one decent one-not happy about the mountains on some of the maps-makes no sense really
6) pnce youve done all there is, theres nothing left to excite you. maybe opening up a second settlement after reaching a certain milestone with different buildings could be enticing, work your way to leader of the world?
7) why even offer gems when they are incredibly hard to mine-they are extremely rare but yet the villagers require them....
8) villagers literally need a well, market, and church at every corner they turn or else they are unhappy-not fun

overall there are more pros and cons but these stood out the most while writing this-i feel a game that has this much potential should be releasing updates, dlc's, and more to keep the game on going because right now its a standstill when you have nothing else left to achieve.

i recommend this game because its relaxing fun but, about 20 hours in and you will want a different game to play.",1636952191,1636952191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Ironic enough, the ""foundation"" of the game has always been very solid, and the only thing lacking all that much has been polish and things to do after you've built a town up. Like most city builders, it is so fun to see your town grow out of that first town center you place, but this feeling is almost moreso because of the unique path making that your villagers do, and the unique way that the existing parts of a town upgrade and change. The art is very charming, and while the character models themselves have no variation, the art on their little info cards does change which I like quite a lot. I'd also like to draw attention to the very smooth and natural way that buildings change based on elevation, where various parts of the model change height and shape based on the terrain you try to put it on. No clue what kind of voodoo magic was necessary to make that work so well, but I love it.

The game does still suffer from a handful of bugs (a lot of them with the fishing huts, oddly) but I haven't gotten a crash to desktop or any game breaking issues in a very long time. The game as it exists now is almost more stable than a lot of AAA titles. My biggest complaint with the game is just that some things aren't really explained all that well. I can put down a hunting cabin, sure, and I have to paint a hunting area, sure, but why can't I paint it over a logging area? Where SHOULD I paint my hunting area, in the forest or in open land? Where can I get gems? How do I prospect minerals? All of these questions are things I found answers for, eventually, but I would have liked the game to answer them instead.

This game isn't for everyone. As the Steam description says, this is a laidback game and not for you if you want to defend your city from sieges or suffer dramatic challenges.

[h1] Noice! [/h1]


This game is [b] amazing [/b]! It is exactly what I was searching for. 

Nowadays, it's like most new games are not very interesting...

But then, I got Foundation and actually had legit fun! It feels great to see your own kingdom grow from nothing into a blossoming medieval village.

I can't wait for it to reach completion (mature from 'early access')! 

Thank you for developing this marvel!

Apart from the basic buildings and production chains, your asked to build customised churches, forts and government buildings. The controls to do this are simple and the result is always rewarding. 

There's also a little bit of light trade and soldier training, but you won't see any of the action.

I'm not sure what the naysayers are on about. This game is early access, and appears to still be in alpha, so of course it's going to be incomplete and buggy. I had one save that always hard crashed when I got to a certain date. Another great example of this is that I used all of the wood and time in the entire world to build a bridge that the AI is not yet coded to use once it's complete. If you are expecting a clean, polished, game you probably shouldn't be buying a game in that's in Alpha and literally went on Early Access two days ago.

What I can say about this game, is that it does deliver already on it's promise. It gives you the opportunity to make a free form medieval town that grows organically, and it does it superbly well. I have been waiting for a game like this for a long time, and despite the bugs and incompleteness, it delivers in spades. The game is incredibly fun and I can't wait to see it grow and get more content over the next years as development continues. I plan to spend quite a few more hours on it now and look forward to coming back regularly as they release new content.

Don't get me wrong, this game DID keep me busy for a few hours, and might be worth the money if it's your cup of tea. Especially down the line when/if the devs overhaul some of the more glaring problems. This is still in Early Access.

In fairness, though i AM writing this without ""completing"" the game fully. I just can't...

Anyhew, as a big fan of city builders, playing almost exclusively these kind of games since the early 90's, i can't recommend Foundation.

The things that are good in this game are almost exclusively all better done in other games, and the things that are bad are webclicker-game bad.

All in all this feels like a better-graphics-worse-everything-else Settlers III-IV which are both over 20 years old...

Pros:  1.) The modular building system is neat. I'd like to see more of that idea in future games of this genre.
          2.) It does remind me a bit of those early-ish Settlers games. This is a ""pro"" until you realize how much of the good stuff from those is missing...

(a couple of the) Cons: 

1.) I do usually expect some terraforming from a modern citybuilder. None of that here (Although tbf there are other games who get away without it).

2.)No military or enemies. Yes you can train troops in a buildable and modular keep, but you only use them for clicker-game-esque away missions. 

3.) Very limited traiding options, no possibility to dump out excess goods. Also has that webgame feel.

4.) It's sometimes really hard to figure out what needs to be done when things doesn't work as expected, such as a good not reaching its customers or a building not completing its building phase. However, these are hopefully just EA problems and will be solved with better tutorials/help systems and some streamlining.

TLDR: Bad city builder. Think ""Settlers Online"" on graphics steroids. Might be better on release, but i doubt it as some design choices feel pretty set by now.

The zoning system (for housing, forestry and crops) is a neat feature which sets it aside from similar games in the genre. I like that it gives the player the freedom to plan their town without having to focus on every single citizen's home. A real Lord isn't going to trouble himself with those kind of minor details, so the villagers are be left to get on with it, but only on the land you designate for housing. You still of course get to place all other buildings, and because you're painting the zones in any random shape you like, the town manages to escape that 'tiled' appearance that many other games in the genre can suffer from.
Bear in mind however, this is an early access game, and it does require some fleshing out by the devs to maintain interest beyond that 10-12 hour mark. While I've yet to hear of any official development road map, one feature I'd put on my wishlist is enemy raids, to provide a purpose for your military garrison other than occasionally sending them off on missions for the King. Would also be nice if there were coastal/river maps and shipping trade, but maybe that's my fondness for traditional strategy/trade games like AoE and the Anno series coming into play.
One complaint, I feel the devs are charging quite a lot for this game considering it is still early access. In it's current state it may only keep you interested long enough to decide whether it's a keeper or refunder. I decided quite early for me that it is a keeper however, mainly because I am having fun building up my little town, and on the fact that the devs are responding positively to player suggestions/criticisms.

While you will likely suffer set backs that stall out your progress, it's very unlikely that you will end up losing your investments or assets permanently (aside from tactically doing so yourself). In its current state Foundation is an incredibly chill experience and well suited for a relaxing evening. Even as an alpha, I find the experience intriguing enough that I would heartily recommend the game.",1635357412,1635357412,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm looking forward to playing again after a few new updates, which it seems like are slow to come out. A few things I'd like to see in the future: 
- more import placed on building a military and defence. Right now, walls are free and armies can only fight in off-screen foreign battles. However, this is a good income source.
- improvement to the system that builds houses. sometimes, I would delete a house while building a market planing a district and then that area would never be built on again no matter the zoning. 
- taverns seem pretty useless right now and cost more than they make; almost no one used either of the 2 taverns in my city with 400+ commoners, 100+ citizens.
- more entertainment options for citizens
- gates to match each type of wall; a special wall type to defend rivers would be nice too
- giant gate should be allowed to be made multiple times so I can offer multiple entrances to my city
- more raw resources and crafting trees for those resources
- evolving relationships with other cities
- more neighboring cities and trade routes that scale with how much you're able to trade
- more options for religious symbols. Only a cross available
- would like if I could alter the number of arches in stones bridges could center them over rivers while still maintaining the end points that I want.",1635256632,1635256632,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I can confidently say 2 years later that the game has fallen from grace if you will, it had potential back in 2019 but as of 6th october 2021 this game has massive issues; 
Bugs: 
- people with jobs being listed as unemployed thefore ruining your immigration
- Half your population constantly staying in the village centre doing nothing productive, this is especially detrimental with larger villages because even the villagers that live out in nowhere apparently like taking a trip to the village centre for half a year.
- For a game that is meant to be very visually pleasing, the game does not have any collision between the villagers and they frequently form person-sized blobs which contains tens of villagers which break the immersion.

Frustrating gameplay:
- You are pretty much required to place down your building perfectly so that your villagers dont spent literally all game walking from one place to another once and then just stay in the village centre.
- The game seem to promote the idea that your should always promote your villagers to the next level such as serfs, citizens or commoners but DONT DO THIS, instead of making them better at anything or making them more effecient all that they become are eating, shitting and moving pieces of shit that contribute nothing to society as they spend their entire day walking around your badly placed village trying to fill their needs and plop down at the village centre the rest of they day. At which point they start screaming to the other villagers how shit it is living here and the other actually productive villagers start leaving because you dont have 50 ruby rings to spend every month.

The progression of unlockable things is mostly good, though a bit unbalanced and mystifying here and there. 
The simulated village is really well-designed and runs well, though part of the game is that you can gradually dig yourself into a supply-chain or economic hole that it can be easier to restart than get out of. 
The quest and military systems are still pretty vestigial. The UI recently got an overhaul and looks and feels very nice. 
If not a tutorial, it would be really good to have some in-game documentation for each building/need/concept, that also lets us know generally how close or far away things need to be from each other. This is the kind of stuff that seems really obvious when you've been living with designing and balancing it all, but players will make all different kinds of assumptions about and end up frustrated.

I’ve always wanted a city-building game that was able to focus down into each of the jobs that needed doing. The developers have some great ideas and are putting them into action.

Pros:
Verge of greatness job system. Lovely aesthetics. Nice music. Simple resources. Modular building system. Assignable building parts. Paint residential areas that auto-build. Reforesting. Can't really deplete resources. Villager work/need fulfillment/pathing is decent! Can see where building access is. Can see workplace, home, and location of villager. Immigration for more villagers. Functional villager/workplace/soldier/trade lists. Increasing max treasury by expanding manor is awesome. Blueprints to find monuments - meh; blueprints to find other versions of buildings - yes please! Monuments for game progress, achievements, and large building projects. Desperately needs economies of scale; this is why I'm excited for new content.

Cons:
Building maintenance is awful. Expanding is expensive. Market income is too important. Builders will walk across the map instead of being assigned to nearby projects. Can't have multiple builders on a single building. Military expeditions are way overpowered. Trade is weak; can't buy some things, can't sell others. Not enough building window options, which would be a good use for glass. Roofs would pool rain so bad. Doors end up underground or do not meet terrain in a visually appealing way. Can't use different building materials for same building (would be nice to have wood, stone, marble as building tiers). No way to level/change terrain. Shouldn't have to paint resource extraction. Lots of building parts have no use. Way too difficult to find/get to minerals. Can't promote villagers from their selection window. The ranks don't matter. No option to auto-assign villagers to open jobs. No easy way to phase out a workplace. Reassigning storage destroys inventory. UI does not show max storage amounts. No unrest. Only emergency is bad weather. (Where is fire risk?)

Some other ideas are:
Seasons, husbandry, hand-carts, paths vs. roads, firewood/warmth, an interconnected world map, [b][i]multiplayer[/i][/b], warfare, raids, and/or skirmishes.

Overall, mid- and late-game have a lot of room to expand on an already strong core. The game is moddable, and there are some that would be good official additions to the game.",1632333452,1632333626,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I can say it's easily one of my favorite games and has everything I'm looking for in a city builder, and the art style is just the right level of cartoony for my tastes. I much prefer the look of this game to games like Banished or Patron. I also LOVE the fact that it's not on a grid. It's no fun to build roads on a grid system and the winding roads the emerge naturally in this game are beautiful. 

I wish I could live in the the peaceful land I've created. Oh, to travel to the shrine behind the monastery, drink the wine in the tavern, worship in the sacred grove (i recommend the pagan monuments mod) or live amongs the forest folk! (another amazing mod)

I just find it so relaxing.

And it's very hard to stop playing, in the best way. If you are looking for a game to dedicate a weekend of freetime to - this will certainly keep you occupied and in good vibes.

First of all this is early access so despite any positive feedback I have about this game this is still unfinished product and it feels like it. Gameplaywise it's basically anno x settlers but with a twist. There are no grids limitting your area for construction. You can even combine buildings into something new and it would still  work. Villagers decide on their own which way they should go to reach their workplaces and homes so you can ignore this aspect of game and just build. I spend most of my time decorating houses, making tidy gardens and fencing properties from eachother. It's a lot of fun but what about challanges? There are currently 4 levels of settlers starting with newcomers who only need food and water and ending with citizens who have wide variety of needs  such as golden trinkets or good meal at the tavern. There are no wars in your lands aside from those you can participate abroad but they are waged off-camera, one of the few events that still require further development.

I've been putting off playing this game for awhile to let it mature.  At first the zoning system for housing seemed interesting until it becomes frustrating.  As houses plop down automatically they don't use the space efficiently often cramming in and blocking others entry.  And this causes villagers to get stuck and complain.

The industry in the game is also interesting until again it breaks down.  Example I can setup a food chain with 1 bakery at the end and that seems to be enough to feed 80 or so people.  This includes the berry pickers as well.  But things start to go wrong in expansion.  As you add a second and a third bread chain it starts to break down.  You could have overloaded stock of flour but unless the new workers are really close to all needs.  They will spend a minute baking bread and call it a day.  This goes with any industry a lumber jack will cut one tree and run off.  

If you don't place things down exactly in balance the game punishes you for it.  You will also need to boot people put of houses and sometimes destroy the house in an attempt to keep balance.  This is magnified when you open a new tile and are expanding into it.  Do you waste all the lumber by building over it?  Do you setup a camp and painfully watch as they cut down one tree at a time?

At the end of every year you have a storm.  It effectively halves most food production and makes you try and plan ahead.  I actually like this feature and it adds a little challenge as you grow bigger.  But if your industry starts slipping because it's out of balance as villagers live to far away from jobs.  This actually becomes more of a frustration then a nice little challenge.  In my last game I watched as no one was picking berries nearly the entire year.  And my bakers where not making bread most of the year.

I think this has to do with the fact that the AI villagers are just dumb.  I don't think they ever reevaluate the fact that a well has been built closer or a market is closer.  I don't think they ever move on their own to get closer to work.  They just keep drinking out of the same well and eat from the same place which is a major problem.  As a player you just assume these things are happening in the background until you know something is wrong.  And before you know it a storm is coming and you have 33 berries and 57 bread plus a few fish and no clothes.

However you also have to factor in that you are upgrading your villagers status.  Where a Serf only needs basic things a Commoner needs more things to stay happy.  However unless you are really on top of it all of this starts to break down.  The game does not have to be super easy mode.  But when you are building systems on top of systems.  You would expect that the lower systems to follow the rules they followed when you built them.  

So a level 1 baker should have to make 5 bread regardless of distance before they can leave work.  And a level 5 baker should have to make 20 bread before they leave work.  This is just an example and may need to be tweaked for balance.",1631852933,1631852933,False,58,1,0.76772993803024292,0,True,False,True

• Casual gameplay
• Houses/roads automatically built
•No grids
• lots of potential
•built-in mod browser
•No utilities 

[b] Cons [/b]

• Runs poorly on mid-tier specs late game
• Does a poor job of explaining itself early game
•Pricey
• Confusing UI (they are working on it)
•Inadequate tools to manage large cities (80+ villagers)


[b]Bugs[/b]

• Late game: Pathfinding and rescource distribution falls apart. Market stalls will be full of clothes yet villagers complain about lack of access to goods. Villagers start ""getting lost"" and can't find paths to their home/work
• Late game: Game performance deteriorates 
•Late game: Rescource production buildings stop working, workers just kind of idle around their job site and walk back and forth from the city center all day, without a ""lack of extraction site"" error


[b] Suggestions[/b]

• When a villager leaves due to unhappiness, say what their job was. Its really annoying to look through every building to see which doesnt have a worker. 
• Optimization
• Better map editor
• Expand the army system
• Rework mineral system. It adds a ""luck factor"" to the game and can really disadvantage you if you arent near any mineral deposits
• add a tiered priority system for building queues, so you can set a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd priority",1631027407,1631039957,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros:
1. Good Sound

Cons:
1. Camera controls are buggy, and tools use and clunky and annoying.
2. Worker population all appears the same boring faces, they animated one face for female and male.
3. Food production is not anywhere near realistic and the wheat and dairy need to be fixed. You cant utilize an entire hexagon for food production for 100 peeps and its not enough. Never mind all the ancillary buildings needed. Why cant a dairy farm produce cheese………. Also, why is milk not a sellable item…….
4. The immigration is dumb, because you have to satisfy current population before new immigrants will come even if the needs of newcomers are being satisfied.......So if your citizens are mad they are getting enough jewelry , new comers won’t come even if there is plenty of food. Then once everyone starts leaving. Enjoy flushing 8 hours of city building down trash and restarting. Oh and btw, your entire population is sterile, so if you have no immigration your city collapses.
5. Maps are so dang small, confining, and devoid of resources. you will have to unlock like 7 territories sometimes just to get access to a resource you need, but only after you pay a crap ton of money to have your bailiff try and find it........
6. The houses are too big in comparison to how many they can hold.......why not either balance the space they occupy or let us build our own. the housing area assignment option makes no sense.
7. Your workers are dumb. They will starve to death versus going one street over to the market.  The coverage areas for markets and wells is s small its ridiculous .
8. The area beautification is sad, pathetic, and lame. Often they will give you awards for accomplishing milestones and it turn out you cant build the items, because most of the materials are end game, or to expensive, or not even available for trade or mining. Every game I play has a few unmade fountains. Oh, and WTH would I want a Garden shrine that I have to hide in a forest where I cant see it??
9. Building a second city to sustain your first is almost impossible.
10. No workshop on steam…….
11. The graphics are clunky and under developed, zooming in is pointless……..

If anyone wants to play a finished game A LOT like this game look at Banished. The similarities are very obvious but that's not an insult. I like the modular construction that Foundation has which is new to me. It's just that when I play colony builders I want all of the information so I can min-max it. However, Foundation doesn't currently tell you everything. In Banished each colonist will reveal their inventory if selected. Not in Foundation. It's the same for houses though I'm not sure if that's necessary in Foundation while it is critical in Banished because your colonists can freeze to death in the winter without adequate fuel. Anyway... there are some deep details like that which I find missing in the current implementation. 

Here's a short list of issues with solutions for the dev team;
* On smaller screens it's probably possible to have a window that exceeds the screen height so make sure there is a scrolling option. You might even give us a maximum height option for windows to force scrolling. That would be useful when power players want to keep many windows open simultaneously.
* In Banished, when people die there is a popup message with their job information and this is logged. In Foundation there is a popup message when a colonists leaves but I have no idea what job they used to do. In my first game my Reforester quit sending my entire Log-based industrial chain into chaos only I didn't know until it was already happening. A better popup message indicating which job was just vacated would be useful.
* I am a balanced player. That means I want to unlock everything in a single playthrough. I don't think this game is designed that way. I see benefits to specialization and a lot of busy work for balanced players. I don't know the creators intent in terms of play style but if balanced is a viable option maybe add a balanced option to all of the dialogue options that make us choose between the three factions. Do some A/B testing. 
* The three factions use two different types of ""currency"": the squares and the circles. This was confusing at first. I think this needs to be more clearly explained and the distinction between the shapes made more distinct.
* Sometimes the text is too small. I know I can change the size of the interface and I did. Thank you for that feature. It would have been unplayable without that. That said, in the windows for the buildings the text displaying the number of assigned workers is still very tiny. I really struggle to make it out. It's all displayed very close to the slash and total. Additionally, it's in red until full. All of these choices combine to make the number of assigned workers hard to read. Please do the following: Have a dedicated color gradient for 0 to Full so we can infer the number at a glance. You can use this color gradient in other places too. Or just remove the color gradient because I can read the other text fine. Also, space out the numbers and slash more like ""1 / 3"" rather than ""1/3"". Please also experiment with using a serif font vs a non-serif font to improve readability. Maybe add an option to control the text size in windows independently of the screen resolution.

These are relatively small issues but they have a big impact on playability for me. The spacing in the number of assigned workers should be a simple change but would greatly improve quality of play. All in all this appears to be an excellent game at this stage though. I look forward to future updates.",1630890659,1630890834,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,True

1. Improve the AI - sometimes i'll set up a lumber camp and the AI will go to the village center halfway across the map
2. More Village Centers - after a certain population, reward with a village center. This will allow players to build multiple castle zones with the AI having better localization
3. War on the Map - send in armies to attack our civilization (potential game mode)

All of the components of this game mesh together beautifully IMO.

I love that the villagers moving around, organically develops the pathing, so you need not pre-build any grids or worry about villagers or buildings not working right because of road connectivity.

The game is very easy and forgiving, which is a nice change of pace, but does get boring.

Hopefully Polymorph has intentions to build in a survival mode, or some kind of larger campaign or sandbox where you need to build many of these villages and survive wars, famines, bad weather (already kinda in the game), economic problems, peasant revolts.

Lastly, Polymorph should kinda pick a lane with the buildings.

Most are just pick and place, but some, like your Manor, Church, Market, or Army Barracks, will require you to drop a pin as the building's anchor point and then gives you a very limited set of blocks you can stick together to make your building.

The Market for instance has 2 stall types with 3 different colored tents, and a handful of other decorative items.

When I want another market with stalls for each of the goods, it is actually really annoying to need to ""design"" another boring market with the same 10 Lego blocks.

I wish there were some templates for Market, Manor, Church, and the Wooden Barracks, so at least I could just choose to pick and place like all the other buildings.

In conclusion, I'd recommend you give this game a shot on a Steam deal if you like the City-Building genre and perhaps might want to try a much more laid back version of Banished.

If people enjoy playing games like Settlers, then this is a good take on a game of that genre with less emphasis on combat mechanics.

Pros:
- Easy to learn, play and navigate
- Simple in graphics, but still fairly aesthetically pleasing
- Can keep you entertained for literally hours upon hours without realising how fast time has passed you by
- AI path finding is great, especially since you can place objects and walls in their path (on their paths) and they'll just bypass it and resume walking on their original path
- There's a lot of item variance and build variety

Cons:
- Gold coin system just seems like a pointless limitation. You can't build if you don't have gold, but you're not purchasing anything while doing so. You then have to pay upkeep in maintenance costs, but you don't consume any materials. Gold coins get used for trading, but beyond that, are worthless. They should change the gold coin mechanic so that it can be used to buy influence with other towns, and factions, as well as buying schematics instead of just gaining schematics for free because your settler count went to 10, or 20 of whatever type.
- Trading is poorly implemented giving you the options to trade everything, yet you can only actually sell 12-16 items. This makes a lot of the production paths pointless because there's no way to economise off them
- AI; while pathfinding is good, their thought processing is poor. Often receiving settler complaints that they need water, or food, or faith, while standing next to the object that provides such a thing, and then they walk to the other end of the town to go and fulfil that need (like walking passed six Wells to go drink from the seventh)
- Town centre is a pointless addition. All newcomers gather there because they don't need housing (apparently) but when you're in the late game that means they have to walk from the complete opposite side to go ""rest"" despite having no need for comfort. It's counter-productive. They shouldn't have to go and wait there, and they really should require housing
- Housing is another poor implementation, it uses a paintbrush mechanic which randomises where the houses just get thrown up, wasting vast amounts of space. It should be a placed building like everything else in the game.
- Space is another issue, the hexagons don't provide anywhere near enough space to actually fulfil your needs within it. For example; building a Monastery can take up a lot more space than a single hexagon. Forts can take up multiple (especially if you want six knights). There's absolutely no need to even have space limitations on a game like this, its just a Sandbox, so adding in needless limitations really doesn't help the game, it simply hinders it.
- There's no real reason to upgrade your settlers once you've unlocked everything... so you can finish the game with like 300 newcomers in your village.
- Transportation is odd. Builders have to acquire the goods to build, transporters sometimes transfer the goods to a building site, but all in all, its a poor system. Depots should be unmanned really and just used for storage with resource creators taking them to the depot when they're full, and resource users obtaining them from the depot when they need them... there's just an unnecessary need to assign a large amount of villagers to move packages from A to B to C when that distance is 10m (especially when they spend 90% of their time wandering about not doing their jobs)
- And that's the last point, the labour in the game is terrible. You wait like 3 minutes watching a settler walk from one end of town to your construction site, they spend about 10-15 seconds hammering away at like 10% of a build, and then walk off again for ""free time"". You're constantly having to relocate your construction tents everywhere just to get them to do their jobs... which in turn means they move further and further away from their housing, which means on free time, they spend even LONGER walking about doing nothing. If a builder goes to a site, and it has resources, it should build the building to completion.

Overall, I spent a hell of a lot of time in this game simply watching, not playing, because of the way the workers ""work"". The last two achievements I got was a shrine and the 500 population, and for those, I simply left the game running for five and a half hours, while coming back periodically every 10-15 minutes to click  ""OK"" for when the storm starts and stops, and that's it. My economy was fine, my immigration was fine. I was sat waiting for a monk to level up and that's it.

Now as much as this does seem mostly negative, with all the above said, I still really enjoyed the game. It's a refreshing building/economy-simulation game, but it has too many limitations that need to be worked out and tweaked. I doubt that I'd return to the game though as I've completed it 100% in 28 hours as there's very little challenges and obstacles in the game beyond the unnecessary gold coin situation, and the time drain of poor labour.",1630611113,1630611113,False,26,0,0.750237524509429932,0,True,False,True

I bought this game thinking it was finally that thirst-quenching Gatorade I always wanted, but instead all I got was watered down Kool-aid. 

Because this is early development, don't expect much. But that is no excuse to expect much in the future either. The game just isn't set up for success. They will need to make a new game or change this one completely.

Build very few buildings for little reason.
Build Armies for no reason.
Buy more Territories to build the same few buildings for no reason.

I believe the idea of growth is behind schedule for this game. There isn't much to do besides create a random little village that just works one part of the day and takes breaks the other part of the day.

1. No real objective

If you know those things, perfect.

What do you get then?

You get a game that feels like Settlers 3 mixed with SimCity and a touch of Cultures. This SimCity part is somewhat small at the moment. You zone residential and other zones and your... Fims will build their houses, grow their fields or gather stuff according to the zone.
The economy is all build by you Settlers style and the Footpaths appear where your people walk often.
The Cultures (or Banished) part is that you tell every Citizen his profession.

there aren't any random attacks on your village, so there is really no need to build an army.
no point in stockpiling anything because your storage fills up so fast, you have to build like 25+ warehouses.. just look ugly. 
only 4-5 maps to choose from, all are pretty lame if i'm honest.. and the map editor app is by far the hardest creation tool i have ever used.. 

the town square, it kinda sucks having 30 people all gathered there randomly to have a lunch break.. 

this game is less like a city building- society constructing game, and more like an ant farm. hard to motivate myself to keep playing. have to get very imaginative and over-the-top immersed. 

(this game does have map mods you can download, but the creation tool is so hard to use the maps people are making are actually worse than the developer created ones.)

i think this game has alot of great potential, this review might be written to early.. but for right now, as i look at my Steam Games library.. this game is hard to click on.

Its still severely lacking in depth and visual polish. You are basically playing on a topographic texture as a map. No Skybox to speak of, no background, the environment is surrounded by empty blue-ish nothing.
It makes it look super alpha and amateurish. 
The maps are also basically empty and some locations are impossible to be chosen as starting points as your people somehow arent starting at the Village Center where you place it, but have to travel to it from the border of the map.
If you decided to start on an island, then you already lost because of that.
Regarding depth it still lacks interesting products and production lines. 
Theres not much to do regarding politics/diplomacy, war or trading, if at all.
In that way, Foundation lacks pretty much everything, visual appeal, polish, depth, quality, well except, the Foundation.
Its name is what you get, even at V1.7 its far behind other games and just not ready.
Regarding development progress, i would avoid buying this game because its going too slow.
[b]Progress is barely made, updates are few and not substantial. 
Its babysteps towards completion and at this pace there are only two results to be expected:[/b]
1.) It will be thrown prematurely into ""1.0"" as a finished but unfinished game.
2.) It will take several years until it reaches a stage that could be considered to be truly a ""1.0"" release with the polish you would expect from a finished game.
Modsupport wont cut it.
Right now there are far superior games to pick up and play. 
The prettiest thing you get with Foundation is possibly its coverart.

[u]Original Review:[/u]
A tough one.
Theoretically good, but it just lacks any depth whatsoever.
There has to happen a lot, because after a few hours it turned into a waiting game where i kept it running at x3 speed while waiting until something finished.
There just isnt a lot to do or pay attention to and i would say it largely is due to a lack of meta systems and because the systems that are there are as of now meaningless (like the uprade paths, sending soldiers to aid your king and the whole relation between you and the King or other cities you trade with, as theres no reputation).

I wish they watched at old city builders (or new ones like Anno 1800) and too a few things from those.
For example i feel like no fulfilling a request by your king (like sending aid for his war), should cause a punishment (like a reputation loss) and once the reputation goes too low or you couldnt fulfill a request (like ""SEND ME CHICKEN""), the King attacks you.
You know, classical Caesar style.

Further i hope for wildlife including wolves and bears (so walls have a proper purpose and dont just affect a pointless symbolic system like a "" safety feeling"" to raise happiness) and bandit raids/camps. You know prebuild bandit camps randomly spawned on the map once you selected your starting region.
Then also a rep system for trading and a world map where you can see other cities, initiade trade, send spies, or send soldiers to raid them.
You know, classical Caesar/Emperor stuff. No need to have them appear in 3D, just an interactable map with diplomatic consequences. Plus said King that wants you to do stuff or attacks you and if you happen to become strong enough, you claim independency and become a new King.

That would turn the game actually into something interesting, give me something to pay attention to and have fun.

Further ofcourse, to keep people busy in the micro area, there are a lot more systems needed. Not just new resources and production queues, but also service buildings that provide a service for something and keep you busy.
Lets say like a townwatch and crime raising when people are unhappy. Just to give an example.
That would cause several things. One, you had to watch happiness so it doesnt happen as often, two you need a townwatch strong enough to fight crime, three you had to decide what happens with criminals and take care of whatever you go for (Prison, ban them or execute them).


And at last, a changing market. 
Prices, offerings and demands are the same all the time.
The market needs to become a system that reacts to what is done on it.
You sell 300 Swords, well demand for weapons is done, weapons are now worth jacksh... for the next few weeks and have to slowly go up in price again.
You buy fish frequently? Well they slowly raise the price each time.
Oh that village stopped to sell wine? Yeah their harvest was bad, they wont sell for an entire year now.
But at least they now offer empty barrels.
Thats how it should go. The current system is boring.


[u]The positive:[/u]
Its still Alpha. so it can turn into something deeper and complex.
As of now its still just a proof of concept. Its mechanically as blant as a Frontier Management game. And well, Frontier Management games dont have real management. They are building tools where you can invest 3 hours sculpting the perfect thingy.
But once you are dont with that, the games are blant and empty.
Thats Foundation, currently. Its a nice castle builder of sorts, but mechanically empty. 80% of the stuff in it is a placeholder, as is a lot of the graphical presentation (no night time btw).
The core systems work mostly, not perfectly, but good enough.
Now its up to them to put actual mechanics into the game and flesh the stuff out. Just putting in new production queues wont do the trick. 
They have to bring more actual thought than just getting the next new item that increases happiness.
Until that happened, i recommend to wait. In its current form the game is a deceiver. Looking nice, but not having a lot under the hood.",1572478352,1630060300,False,141,1,0.837961971759796143,4,True,False,True

It's super fun, I like how you can build your own castle, church etc and I just like the whole system of the small village that grows to a huge medieval city. 

There is a few things I'm struggling with, however:

- No more quests: after a few introduction quests, the game just kinda lets you to do whatever you want and figure things out on your own, which would be fine but I find it quite challenging to progress without quest rewards, especially because the money limit is 500 gold, while buying a new land is also 500 gold. Whenever I want to buy another land I have to wait out the moment when I have exactly 500 gold (note that it's always changing) and click really fast or I have to keep waiting. 

- Nothing really happens after the first quests: you're progressing on your own, and occasionally some random dude shows up and says you have to donate this (resources), and if you do so, you'll get influence points (or something like that) which can be spent for upgrades. It would be alrgiht if it happened more often, however, the dude in my game usually wants fish, and bruh I don't even produce fish yet. Plot twist, to produce fish, you need to have enough influence points which you get from donating stuff, but HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET INFLUENCE POINTS TO BUY THE FISHING OPTION WHEN THE DUDE ALWAYS ASKS FOR FISH? Smh.

- Buying and building things feel kinda expensive in consideration you literally have to do everything on your own, without a quest reward system to at least help you out in the first few hours. Note that after the first hour, you will have to build at least 3 different building to produce what you want (for example wheat --> dough --> bread), and as you can't produce a specific type of resource (which is needed for almost every building) without like 4 builldings and a mineral mine (which is rare to find), you will need to buy it from trading. But how am I supposed to have all this money, especially when the limit is 500? (There might be a way to expand this, but if there is, the game doesn't show you. I'll read through the tutorial next time I'm playing I swear.)

Apart from these things, I enjoy playing it and I do recommend buying it, although maybe wait for future updates as it's still in development.",1629910224,1629910224,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

A few problems with balancing and the discovery of mods!

I cannot for the life of me figure out how one gets cloth. Perhaps another city will trade it but the first one doesn't, leaving you without the cloth you need to make market tents or decorate your manor for splendor points.

There are also strange outages with berries and wood that can't be fixed easily. You may not own land w/ enough berry production to keep up after population rises or you sell some. Berry fields seem to stop producing or produce less without any warning or way to renew them.

Wood clearcutting is more obvious but also happens very quickly. You must build to produce things and employ people, and that takes wood. Also, your early trading requires selling planks that come from wood. Soon, you will have no trees. Replanting takes forever and only one forester works in each camp. It seems that you're destined to clearcut away every forest and I don't see how that's fixable.

Villagers complain about housing when there is ample housing zoned. Sometimes they even complain if the entire land is zoned residential! I think what they are complaining about is desirability, and that's another nerf that's not fixable. Buildings that you must have turn huge areas ugly and undesirable. Well, you only have so much land. Putting those buildings next to cliffs or water helps cut the negative desirability in half, but it's still huge. So undesirable areas are a problem the game creates but doesn't let you fix.

Fishing appears to be possible but isn't open to me yet, despite water all around and fish being offered for trade. It seems strange that I can't have anyone fishing locally but I need to buy fish to increase food satisfaction in the marketplace. Shouldn't those two things be switched?

The reverse is true for honey. I can stockpile and buy it on trade and the trader tries to sell it every time, but I cannot sell honey because it is a luxury food and I don't have a market stall for that. So, honey arbitrage, lol? I shouldn't have to buy a resource I could produce (fish) and I should be able to sell stuff I buy (honey).

Now... the  good news. Mods! I have never used mods anywhere but MS Flight Simulator because they are generally finicky to install and they offer stuff I don't need in the game. Foundation has really changed my mind. First off, the mods are so easy to discover and install that you could easily overlook it. They're right on the main menu! You don't need an account or a login at mod.io to get them, either. That site does have longer explanations of each mod that are worth reading before you install, but the mods themselves are very easily managed from within the game. How cool is that?

I would definitely recommend the Nature Decoration and Fantasy Decoration mods because they have tons of free decorative elements that really improve the look of buildings and denatured areas. The game is 10x more attractive if you lay down your own custom décor, and since the whole game is super chill and about creative flexibility anyway, it seems really smart of the developers to support mods and make them easy. Some of the available mods are so complex they'd be DLC in other games -- adding entirely new behaviors to the economy with buildings, new resources, and trade.

Overall, Foundation is excellent so far and a worthy contender in the genre.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: 1 hour in

Ok, I get it now! It took a little bit to grok this game, but now I'm into it...

My fav city builders are Tropico and Jurassic World: Evolution 'cause I like the heavy themes. This is one is pretty much the complete opposite. If you're looking for a super chill builder without a lot of preset goals, you might like Foundation. At first, I couldn't figure out why the ""economy"" wasn't working. Stuff stuck in buildings, or lack of resources that were obviously present... But, if you think of it like a puzzle (or Google the thing you're stuck on), you'll see that sussing out the economy is a big part of the game. Once you understand what kind of jobs people need to do in a certain place to move things forward, you can start to assign them where you want them -- and move them when needs change. And that's all the hint I'm going to give you!

If this sounds like micromanaging, perhaps it is... but much less stressful than something like a Tropico campaign. In fact, there are no campaigns. You are dropped immediately into what other games would call the sandbox. There is some minimal guidance to point you the right direction (pretty much just the right amount), but that's it.

A word on the UI. At first, I couldn't figure out why there were so many small dialogs overlapping. I had several building and villager dialogs cluttering the screen, seemingly for no reason. Then it hit me... these are like *control panels* in other games. Let's say you need to keep an eye on two buildings (say one needs something from the other). This is  when you keep your two control panels open and move them to somewhere visually convenient, like ""docking"" them along the right side. Now, you are really starting to master the monitoring and control aspect.

The other thing that might seem irritating at first is clicking around on villagers or buildings because it's hard to compare them or make mass changes. Well, this is what The Book is for. If you poke around, you'll find that The Book and these mini control panels offer a lot of ""advanced"" choices for moving people or making mass changes within a dialog. Like moving two people from one building to another within the same dialog. I'm assuming these are some of the UI improvements that came in this last release (I didn't see the other release) and, I have to say, this is a good design. Many times these games bury ""mass"" or complex changes beneath too many clicks or make you move around to manage multiple assets. Foundation does not. You can use the individual controls or The Book as you like.

As others have pointed out, the self-building roads and houses are a really cool aspect of this game. Rather than worrying about complex layouts, you let the villagers build natural roads around your town. I'm also just getting to the ability to customize buildings by choosing their parts, design, and layout. This is something I've never seen before in a city builder and it looks like it will be very cool.

Now, back to the game!...",1628539627,1628700152,True,36,1,0.753842592239379883,0,True,False,True

I'm not normally a fan of the city/colony builder genre but Foundation is such a chill, stylish, and unique experience that I couldn't help but fall in love with the game. I really appreciated the 'organic' and 'natural' way that the game handles housing and road development - often resulting in cities with asymmetrical neighborhoods and interesting road systems based on what is the easiest path from points A to B. I always feel that hyper-symmetrical housing and road systems (especially in historical settings) seem phony so Foundation has been a breath of fresh air in the 'aesthetic immersion' category. 

Foundation is certainly on the 'easier' side of city/colony building games. As of now, the negative consequences you face throughout the game are minimal and it's never too difficult to dig yourself out of a hole should you find yourself lacking in crucial resources or other means with which to fulfill the needs of your denizens. All unlockables are obtained in a straightforward manner and the biggest contributor to achieving the required goals is time spent playing. This is great for a more casual player but veterans of the genre may find the game a bit too simplistic and/or easy. 

Given its 'Early Access' status, the full-price of the Foundation is steep but I think the game is a terrific value when on sale for ~$20 USD or so. If the development team expands on the trading system, adds more weather/seasons variety, and increases randomized events with (with greater consequences), I think the game will be totally worth the full-price.

I came to foundation from the Tropico Series and from Anno 1404. Both are great games but Tropico's crazy crop optimization  and Anno's (Venice) fixation on market centers the intent of both seemed to be  for the player to escape going broke. 

Over all, Foundation focuses more on the city building element, opening the way to more creativity for building communities that are aesthetically pleasing.  There are infinite opportunities to experiment. with different layouts. The game still presents challenges. You can go broke. You can alienate your villagers and cause them to leave. With each level, as new building possibilities open up you can overwhelm you builders creating gridlock.

Major building projects demand substantial investments in providing raw materials and builders.and without the necessary preparation, the game can be hellishly slow. You might go out for dinner, literally,  while your church or lord manor is under construction.

Development has been slow. Much of the ""positives"" about  Foundation owes to the modders who have created fresh elements that greatly improve the vanilla version which would be rather bland, without. 

There are issues that need improvement.  Most important is building construction which comes with a number of issues.  First, is leveling terrain. If you're a little careless, and forget to increase the height of a building element, it may vanish,  and be buried in the hillside. The uneven terrain often means that building components intended to lock together, fail to engage and will break apart if the structure is moved. There are also the radiating circles of green, intended to show areas of effect. These can be a nightmare. If you inadvertently drag on one of those circles, it will drag that particular element, breaking apart your whole structure. Putting the structure back together can be a nightmare.  

I mentioned previously that elements may vanish entirely into the landscape and become lost. When trying to piece together a structure not fully connected, these lost bits can come back to haunt you.  Making the links connect, means turning and moving the entire project. Linking the elements may entail turning and moving your project. If a building element has vanished into the grass, or into the green rings, you may get a warning, ""too far.""  Until and unless, you can come into proximity with that missing link your entire work can be left in limbo.  and cannot be placed. You may have to scrap the whole thing and start over. 

The second problem that needs attention is scrolling. The devs seemed to overlook the fact that scrolling, scrolling, scrolling can be tedious. The ""shortcuts""  on the building menu don't have all the necessary elements for a modded game. That can mean, endless scrolling back and forth over a poorly organized menu. Once you have made a choice, the menu closes and when you reopen it, it's defaulted back to the beginning. More scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. 

As if that weren't bad enough, try out the menu for the ""wooden keep.""  It's nuts! It looks like somebody ran amok with a favorite hobby and included everything you never wanted to know about castle buildings, pinions, balustrades, square towers, octagonal towers, machicolations, open roofs, closed roofs, roots open on two sides, open ramparts, fully enclosed ramparts, partially open ramparts.  If can take several minutes to scroll through what must be close to a couple of hundred elements to find a roof for one of the buildings of your keep.

That said, I enjoy the game. The issues I have cited here are well recorded, particularly scrolling and terrain leveling and I feel confident that the devs will have recognized the problems and are doing something about them.

From the very start, the ""wood camp"" for example, requires tools that you can't manufacture.  If you place and delete the building for example you can brick the whole game and need to start over.  The economy too quickly centers around coins where your town becomes addicted to trade.  The trade system is timer based and lazily implemented. 

There are also routine events like citizen promotion that are hidden behind huge wait timers (30 minutes or something like that).  These are again based on coins and not the resources that these towns can collect early on like wood, berries and stone.  You can speed up the game, but that takes the fun out of it for me.

The scale and depth of the village grows with the different levels of access to new construction and people jobs/ roles.

The trade and inventory system can use a bit of an upgrade in terms of ability to track rates of production/use, or how much is actually being bought or sold. I would like a map overlay of material availability also. Early wealth and land development can be slow.

Most of my criticisms are just fine tuning and polishing. The ploppable building style and AI formed roads are very interesting and almost always result in the building of different 'districts' or 'zones' as you expand.

TL;DR - This game has an incredible amount of potential, plays very well for being ""unfinished"", is definitely not for everyone, has several issues that make it infuriating, and needs to be labeled casual in every sense of the word.

Reading a long-winded pedantic review is annoying. Here's my opinion in bullets with more information later:

[b] Pros [/b]
- The game is beautiful in a minimalist, cute, and old-school looking way. If you're looking for insane graphics with gorgeous interfaces and cut screens etc, this isn't the game for you.
- The land purchase and upkeep costs are an innovative design and add a challenge plus realism that's refreshing. You can't just take over every square inch of the map without consequence because you want space or resources. It forces you to prioritize space, limited resources, and coin in an innovative way that feels real.
- The way resources and need are currently designed the game makes you feel like you're actually managing a civilization in a real way. It's 100% not a ""set it and forget it"" type game. Constant attention needs to be paid to your outflow/production of ALL resources directly related to your population which can fluctuate wildly.
- The fact you are not allowed to create homes for your citizens can be a hard pill to swallow when you first start but eventually becomes one of the most interesting parts of the game. Similar to the Sim City games where you place areas for building types to ""pop up"" and AI build, this game uses ""desirability"" and population happiness/citizen rank to determine housing which removes some optimization and control from your hands.
- There is a solid spread of resource types to let you customize your specialty and an extremely limited amount of trading with other (unseen off map) civilizations. This could be a CON for a lot of people but it adds a challenge to the game in choosing specific types of resources you produce, the cost (coins/upkeep, people, space) of having them, and furthering the management of the areas you unlock. I'll discuss this more in CONS.
- Even though this game has essentially nothing to do with battles or war, there is a way to have a military aspect to your civilization. This also reinforces the causal aspect of the game. There's no competition with AI either in conquest or for resources. These off screen battles are hollow and you have essentially no control over the outcome. It's just a %chance of winning. Could easily be a CON if you're looking for army battles etc.
- You have to discover raw materials in a realistic way. It's not just apparent and obvious which mountain contains marble vs other materials.
- It's honestly relaxing and low stress considering. Even when things are going sideways (which they will) there's no dialog boxes popping up telling you everyone'd dying, you're a failure, the society is collapsing, etc. No one dies, in fact. It's more akin to owning a business than some life or death thing. If the store is busy and making money, that's great and we are all very happy. If it's a slow day, you wont go bankrupt or something. Try again tomorrow. The CON side to this is that it feels like you can't ""fail"" the game or have everyone just die. You will essentially revert to a point in the already established society where it balanced. This generally happens when you've become too ambitious with expansion and your society grows too quickly and cannot sustain the established food production.

[b] Cons [/b]
- The resource panel on the top of the screen is utterly useless to a detriment. For example: I had 235 citizens and (per the panel) had over 1000 bread, over 800 fish, and over 1200 berries with markets (wastefully) overlapping areas. Every market had plenty of stock and someone running it but happiness plummeted constantly because of ""food shortages."" No explanation on any site I can find.
- The interface with distribution of resources is honesty stupid. As it stands, you can build a ""market"" which is one table with a single resident working it. Apparently they are simply unable to sell more than one thing at a time. Meaning you can have 8 different food sources but can only sell one type to your citizens at a time to feed them. So, if you're not paying attention and you run out of fish and forget that 3 of your markets sell fish your citizens are too dumb to walk to a further market or allow you sell a different type of food. You have to manually change it, wait for the food to get there, and hope it helps.
- There needs to be a panel to see all building types or some more eloquent management system. As it stands, you can see a list of peoples name, where they work, and an extremely obscure ""description"" of how they are doing. ""Villager path is blocked"" then you snap to them and they are happily walking around doing their thing with no way to correct the issue(?). ""Cannot find housing close to workplace"" I don't control that and stop being lazy. ""No access to (insert resource)"" even if you have literally 10 times the amount of food available as described above they still won't have access. No explanation as to why, how to fix it, how many you need to satisfy this reoccurring issue, or an interface to visualize accurately where food is ""short"" or how to get more there. I've even had multiple market tables on top of each other in areas with ""low food"" or whatever and it did nothing. There isn't even a larger building to buy or upgrade to that would allow them to buy whatever they want as much as they need.
- The trade system is extremely clunky. You have to read through an antiquated log system to confirm if you're actually trading things and how much. Plus, there's only 3 other villages to trade with and they don't have all the resources you need or the want to buy certain resources you may have chosen to produce. It creates a feeling of being in a box and like the developers are forcing you to only choose certain resources to create. Making cheese can feed my people (if they actually go get it from the market) but I can't trade it to other villages for coin. This gets tricky when you're trying to reduce upkeep and you have limited citizens which creates that feeling of being forced into one play style.
- Once you hit a large population, my experience has been over 200, the civilization collapses. All sale items you have at the markets are insufficient and people are miserable. You can have 14 tables of common clothes and it flies off the shelves at an unrealistic pace. 200 people buying 600 ""common clothes"" a week is insane. Even luxury goods makes no sense. How many rings do you need? This would also be simpler and more realistic if you could stock multiple things in these ""markets"" so people could choose more than one resource at a time and you wouldn't just constantly run out to the detriment of happiness. 
- The ""level"" people get for doing a job over time implies there's some benefit to putting the level 6 miner in the mine versus the market. If there is a benefit, I haven't identified it. This comes back to the lack of a useful interface or descriptions of mechanics. This is obviously part of a larger issue mentioned before.
- To really drive home the interface problem: as I mentioned several time, this is a casual, resource management, building placement, resource optimization game. You would think the one thing that would be over the top would be the system that allows you to manage all that since there isn't a whole lot of substance beyond this core concept. It is by far the most antedated, useless, honestly misleading interface I have ever used. It's incredibly tedious to ""keep track"" of production vs consumption, sales vs purchase, and the general needs of the people. All the selections are pop-ups that go wherever they want to on your screen, too.

This is my second early access game ever and I've not had a single crash or any other glitches. I'm running a pretty mediocre rig and frame rates are pretty consistently at 60fps without sweating. Load times are pretty good and with an original download size of ~3Gb you're getting a fair bit of game that doesn't feel bloated. 
The recent UI overhaul is positively stunning (not that I played the old one but have seen it on YouTube.) The ability to just drag windows wherever and stack them to keep an eye on progress or just hide them all with a single click is an OCD paradise. The frosted glass look on each window adds to the overall aesthetic, devs have done an absolutely terrific job on the UI imho. 
There are definitely times where I've been stuck on what to do next and had to google a solution like how the hell do you convert villagers to monks but the answers are out there and over time I'm hopeful that certain things will become more obvious with in game tips etc. (Monastery needs to have at least one room set to a dormitory before you can add monks by the way).

I have only one complaint. As development has gone on, the game has become bogged down with frustrating mechanics that change the feel of the game play from a relaxing sandbox experience where your creativity is unlimited, to a stressful, frustrating management simulator. Newcomers will sometimes continuously leave without a tool for identifying the cause. There is an infuriating RNG component to immigration even when your happiness is peaked, and sometimes pathways will be obstructed as a result of the way your citizens free-build, the game lacking quick and effective tools for targeting the jam and subsequently fixing it.

My ask is that the devs make the systems balance more forgiving, and perhaps even remove collision altogether.

1. Building houses for your villagers is a nuisance. While I like the concept of painting your designated areas, it becomes frustrating because the game doesn't give you any indication about how many villagers can fit in said area. The game doesn't tell you if you should make it a specific size in order to build one house. You could paint two residential areas of the exact same size and desirability yet only one will be used and the other will remain empty for the majority of the game.

If you're a neat freak and like to keep things orderly, this game is not for you. While I can appreciate the devs giving it an organic feel, there should be a way to neatly place houses with the painting tools if you want to. 

In my most recent playthroughs I had upgraded one of my villagers to a commoner, this requires goods and and a certain level of comfort (desirability). All of my houses were high/very high desirability yet, my commoner ended up leaving my colony because the houses wouldn't upgrade. Gotta love when when of your most upgraded villagers leaves two hours into the game. 

2. Supply chains randomly break. In this game you have to build markets to supply your villagers with a source of food. On several occurrences my market's decide to only sell one type and I'm left with an excess of every food except one and happiness starts to decline, resulting in villagers leaving. 

3. Progression. As you progress, you're able to unlock certain goods and services by getting access to new buildings. However, the game seems to force you into a certain progression line leaving you without many options. Example: In order to unlock wool/cloth/clothing you need one Commoner, yet this commoner needs to have access to goods (e.g. clothing) if you're new and you don't know this you can kiss your newly upgraded villager goodbye if you're not prepared. 

4. Villagers get stuck for the most ridiculous reasons. Doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason as to why, nor does the game tell you why. Villagers will get stuck in their houses, or your soldiers will go into your fort and not be able to come out. Fortunately with the custom buildings these issues can be fixed by adding a random door. 

I do appreciate the devs trying to come up with something new and the new UI is quite nice although it seems like the devs focus has been the UI (even though it was fine the way it was). I used to be able to customise windows how I liked them, now I'm stuck with one window that I constantly have to cycle through just to make sure I'm being efficient. 

The fact that some of these issues have been around since the game came out is ridiculous. Especially if you're going to charge more than twenty-fucking-dollars. I would like to know how much you plan on charging for a fully functional game if that ever happens. But for the time being, I will not be recommending this to any of my friends.

The bugs I spotted was as follows
1- When you destroy workplaces workers are still assigned to that workplace and you need to remove them manually before destroying workplaces.

2- Some of the npcs are stuck at the map's limits and at houses so they can't go to work.

3- Woodcutters are not going to far places, may be it can be like in stoneheath, if we can just assign a region to cut down immidiatly it would be the best option to avoid resource shortage.

There was an update recently, that was touted as a super-big-deal, so thought I'd give it another try.  Unfortunately I'm experiencing the same issues.  For example, it says to place a town centre, but to be careful where to place it as it can't be moved later.  IT DOES NOT GIVE ANY OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE ARE GOOD PLACES AND BAD PLACES!  It give you a quest to build a manor.  It gives you the ability to choose a bunch of cool things to the manor like towers and chimneys and flags.  So of course I added those.  Only to find a few hours later that the manor cannot finish being built as those things require resources that I don't have and can't trade for.  Do they expect me to start this game again after several hours with a resigned, 'Oh well, never mind, I learned something?'  And then do the same thing for another two hours until I hit ANOTHER snag and have to restart it AGAIN?  We'll I'm not bloomin' doing that I can tell you!  Even trading is incredibly non-intuitive.  When they say, 'Sell all above this value,' do they mean sell-number-of-resources-above-this-value, or sell-each-resource-if-you-can-sell-it-for-more-than-this-value?  Later I got a quest to sell berries to the king.  I had the requisite number of berries.  But the dumb game never told me HOW to sell them/complete that quest.  Not even in the help thing about quests or trading.  So yeah.  Still incredibly frustrated and still feeling like it's a waste of time.  Some of the interface things look a little nicer.  But it's like staying at a hotel that have been thoughtful enough to leave a mint on your pillow, but you find the bed unmade and the shower dirty.  Note to developers: I will only change this review if you change the game dramatically so it's actually user-friendly.  It tells you what to do, (options when various paths work, disables actions that will make it impossible to progress in the game - for example it should not allow me to add things to my manor design that will make the building physically impossible to finish - and hence the manor mission physically impossible to finish, and hence impossible to unlock any other buildings and quests...) this should be right down to the 'left click here because [X], not there because [Y.]  It should walk you through the game with parts of the screen flashing to show you where you need to look and click (it told me to go to the Trading Panel, but it took me a long frustrating time to find the thing!)  It should explain what you're doing and how various actions will help or hinder you later in the game.  Still same review as below - too difficult to know what to do or to know what you're doing well or badly.  I've played sims and resource-based games for ages.  This is in the top 1% of frustrating games I've played.  Read my original review below.  It still stands.

Not enough information to be able to play the game.  Every time I want to perform even the simplest of actions, I basically need to go and read a few pages of information off the internet.  Which is not fun.  No intuitive.  You don't know whether your actions were good or bad.  You don't know how to make certain things in the game work.  You don't know what's going well or badly at any given time.  The in-game help is woefully inadequate.  It's basically a remake of the Setters game that came out like 20 years ago, except it's less attractive-looking, and far less easy to understand.

This is a game about supply chains, but you can only control those supply chains in a sort of top down abstract way. You can't specify delivery frequency or supply priority. You have to just make sure your warehouses are kept stocked, or that you shutdown production at low priority buildings.

Foundation is advertised as a city-builder game similar to Cities: Skylines. The trailer was jaw-dropping, and the ability to create huge custom castles and massive sprawling cities was amazing. Alas, when I started playing, I ended up getting very annoyed. The game is 90% resource management and 10% city planning. You need resource A and B to get resource C to get resource D, all with somewhat limited building space. I've enjoyed games like that before, but it's executed in the most clunky and inefficient way possible.

See all those houses in the trailer? See how it looks like a real sprawling medieval city? Yeah, no, those are placed automatically by the villagers. They'll either waste tons of space, or force you to manually paint the area for every single house manually. I'm not kidding, that's what every guide I read recommended. Imagine doing that in Cities: Skylines. Imagine if every single house had to be manually painted on the map, instead of being placed manually, or painted on a grid. It's not necessarily hard, it's just a chore.

The other thing that really annoyed me is the monument building. If you cruise around long enough, you'll see people building these huge churches, manors, keeps, etc. This was a really amazing concept, but it's ultimately shackled to your constant demand for resource micromanagement. On top of that, villagers require certain buildings in certain areas, so going all-out and creating massive cathedrals like the game advertises just wastes time, resources, and precious space.

To be clear, Foundation isn't a terrible game. It's just such a chore to get through with far too many limitations to keep me interested.",1624375448,1625245676,False,149,5,0.687058389186859131,49,True,False,True

I tend to avoid early access games until they are released, since you usually get a half-done game which falls short on the content and buggy. But this game feels polished and definitively playable!

TLDR: If you like resource management/builder games, but don't want to spend time on mapping roads/houses and micromanage everything, but still like SOME customization here and there: Get it :)

Disclaimer: I have not tried any mods yet, so this review is only on the base game.

After ~12h, this is what I have to say:
+/- Type of game: I REALLY liked the old Settlers 2 game, due to the focus on resources and building, with a mix of very light warfare. This game has the same kind of vibes, but with a bit more resource management, which I like.
+ Content: Plenty of content to keep you busy, I just hope the devs will not stop adding content, since I really like the base game. It already feels like a full game though. There is support of mods though, so that could add community content.
+ Building: I like the mix of not having to place roads (they are automatically mapped by the population) and houses (you can paint areas where houses are allowed and you people will place them), but then being able to place workshops, farms (and where they farm), etc. Imo., it's the perfect mix of not having to micromanage everything, but still being able to steer the design of your kingdom in the way you want to. The roads/houses also get a natural feel to them, since I usually tend to do some kind grid system ""let's add all houses in a perfect row here and draw straight roads everywhere"". So you get a nice realistic looking kingdom out of the box. You can also customized some buildings (churches, monasteries, manors, etc.), which is not really my thing, but a nice feature though.
+ Resource management: There are plenty of resources to keep an eye out on and sell to your peasants, but they are paced really nicely, so you get introduced to them at a nice pace and you can offer different resources to cater for e.g. ""luxury"". So you don't have to hunt too badly for specific resources.
+ Graphics/sounds/music: It has nice clean looking graphics. The music and natural sounds (bird singing, water etc.) puts a very pleasant vibe to the game overall.
- It would be nice with some more disasters (there are already storms, but they just decrease food output basically) to add some more challenge to the game: Maybe storms causing building to collapse, flooding or a fires, where some building are destroyed/needs repair, then you have to put in some effort to recover.
- The military mission system could use a bit of polishing, it gets a bit boring with the same few missions all the time. It would also be nice to get more types of soldiers and missions requiring e.g. catapult to finish (siege some city). Maybe it would be possible to have some map with different missions on it and alliance system to make it a bit more fleshed out and interesting? I think the base is good though: choose which soldiers based on exp to send and add a mix of random reward/risk/etc. No direct steering combat etc., you send them off and they send reports back about the progress and come back with loot (if you won the battle).
- There are also mini-missions ""deliver 10 fish"",  but they feel a bit like they could use some rethinking. It feels like they could use some more randomized requests/rewards.",1625067826,1625067826,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Polymorph games seem to have completely lost the plot as far as reasonable progress is concerned.  It seems to me they're using the worst of Early Access games such as Project Zomboid as their role-model, and that is a worry.

In the 2.5 years since my original review, they have added resource deposits, a few animation / building improvements and a new UI.  Oh, sorry how could I forget the most amazing feature of all, customizable key binding!

The game desperately needs a customisable random map generator, additional path types such as cobblestone/brick, more food and goods sources, wild animals to actually make the world feel alive, more parts for the major buildings, more decorative objects, change of seasons and so on.  

It simply doesn't need lame future ""features"" such as building maintenance and other changes that just don't play to the games strengths.  The whole tacked-on, weak military aspect adds nothing to the game and seems to be simply a resource sink.  This is perfectly demonstrated by the fact you can build walls around your town but they have absolutely no purpose other than looking nice!

So this is the most casual of city builders.  People didn't buy it for a management challenge, they bought it because of the grid-less layout, waving grass and quaint forests, organic paths and the pretty ""village in a landscape"" screenshots.  

Don't get sidetracked!  All you need to do is improve and accentuate the strengths of the game, oh and try to get it done within the say 2 years, please. 


[b]Positives:[/b]

The Forest and Coastal maps are impressive graphically.  The new grass other effects create a nice rural atmosphere.

The music is fitting to the theme and relaxing. It really adds to the games atmosphere.

[b]Negatives:[/b]

No random map generation. and only 5 static maps (Coastal, Fluvial, Hills, Mountains, Valley).  If you watched someone play the game on youtube and then choose the same map type (eg Coastal) you will be playing on *exactly* the same landscape.  I found this completely disappointing. 

The UI scaling is broken. On my 2560x1440 (2k) monitor at 1.5x scaling only the top left buttons are visible.  As a result the only way to exit the game was killing the process in task manager.

The Valley and Mountain maps are really quite ugly in comparison with Hills and Fluvial maps.  This is mostly because the huge expanses of rock have an ugly texture and the mountain shape are far too steep and unrealistic.  

There are a number of other strange mechanics that I can't work out if they are bugs or just poorly communicated (eg Trading, construction mode quirks, etc).   Unfortunately I can't investigate these further as Steam has this too short limit of 2 hours (5 would be better) before a refund is refused.

[b]Summary:[/b]

In summary, I can't recommend Foundation at this stage.  

It's easy to make excuses for developers in EA (small team, poor UI is acceptable, lack of content acceptable).  However the problem Polymorph games need to understand is that most of their fellow developers [b]who have created successful games[/b] in EA had no problem putting out games that have been adequately tested and still provide a a great amount of content/gameplay. (often thanks to random maps / procedural generation).  

So I can't recommend Foundation because I'm simply comparing it to the standard set by other indie games entering into EA.  Foundation is below that level.  

I do hope Polymorph games fix these glaring bugs and implement all of the major features stated on their roadmap here.  https://trello.com/b/i5AX944p/foundation-roadmap

Foundation is not worth the price even on sale and if I was currently still playing any other city builder game I'd probably have asked for a refund already.  My computer is a beastly custom gaming rig, not some low end Dell, so that's not causing any problems. The first issue I had was the controls.  There should be a mouse camera control, such as holding right mouse to move the camera.  There's not, you're stuck with the keyboard.  Which wouldn't be so bad if they hadn't assigned the default hotkeys backwards.  That's right, Q turns the camera RIGHT and E turns it LEFT.  WTF.  Also, building placement rotation is janky as hell and zoom goes from full out to zoomed in on 4 pixels in 2 clicks of the mouse wheel.  So I fight past the controls and get 8 hours or so into a city.  Have about 90 population. Can't make any sense of building the parts for the church and manor.  Am I supposed to be spreading these all over as I expand to increase housing desirability? Why can they be built so ridiculously tall? Why can't I upgrade their height after they're built?

Foundation is a gridless city-builder with many systems including trade, religion, production-chains, happiness, quests, and much more.  It was much deeper than I anticipated and so far I am having a great time with this game.  Highly Recommended if you enjoy games like Banished.

PROS

+ Freedom to build virtually anywhere
+ Classic job system improved by citizen levels and promotions
+ Excellent graphics, excellent UI, good music
+ Organic village feel with paths and homes being built automatically
+ Lots of additional systems like trade, kingdom relationships, villager promotions
+ Random events and quests keep things interesting
+ Feels stable and polished

CONS

- Some features confusing (building large, modular structures)
- Some features confusing (how do I deliver 30 berries to the King?)

I am working on my second town, after some trial and error on my first. I currently have a population of about 300 people, almost 10k gold, an army, a pretty large city center with a far off mining settle that's being established now so I can start to use a quarry, and have unlocked the monastery as well as most of the ""special"" buildings that you buy with splendor. 

Aside from all that, I love the graphics and the music, and the on-going challenge of expanding your town and re-arranging buildings as needed to incorporate the new buildings/goods/markets.

There's not enough tutorial material. You get quests like ""deliver 50 planks to Clergy"". Great. How? I got 50 planks! How the hell do I complete the quest? So I google, and I get a long thread where people say once you get 50, there's a button to complete the quest. So I got 50, but there's no button anywhere.

Quest says ""promote your first villager at the end of the month"". How? Where? So I google, and again a thread saying there will be a popup at Week 4, Day 7. I don't get the popup. So wtf. Oh, turns out villagers need their ""needs"" met before any popup will pop up. I must've googled 5 or 10 things like this, despite the game including a help book.

The paint mechanic I don't quite get yet either. You can pain woodcutting sections and foresting sections and residential sections. So I pained some residential sections in highest desirability areas and sat for half hour, waiting for them to build anything, while warnings blared that my villagers ain't got housing. Turned out I didn't paint enough.

So I painted everything I could. All my territory is painted for all available painting layers. Is that good? Is that bad? I don't freaking know.

Frustrated for now, but hopeful for enjoyment past the learning curve. The cutesy art style and some depth in building structures and management screens that I can see to be available as unlocks is what's telling me this game is on the ""yes"" side for recommendation.

TLDR: The game is absolutely great, but needs to be updated more to fix some minor problems. It's worth buying, but it'd be better to wait for it to go on sale if you want it to be worth your money (but at least it isn't a steaming pile of garbage).

Pros:
-Very interactive; you get to easily customize names of villagers, buildings, etc. and assign jobs to specific villagers (though you can also just quickly assign jobs to random unemployed villagers)
-Unlockable hexagonal tiles (that don't increase in unlock price, just in taxes)
-You don't have to plan roads, as villagers pave paths that they find easiest to use (just by walking on that path)
-There is a good modding community that adds to the flavour of the game
-The maps in the unmodded game are actually pretty decent, despite some resource issues
-It's easy to let the game sit idle while you're doing something else, but you can also micro-manage as much as you want

Cons:
-It's kind of difficult to first get into the game since the help tab isn't very helpful at times
-I can't seem to get past a population of 50 without using mods, but that could just be me to be honest
-There isn't much in terms of a creative mode unless you use mods, but thankfully the mods are very good
-It's difficult to create 2 markets far apart from each other, as villagers will seemingly just randomly choose which one to go to, and will run out of other needs before getting there and back
-I'm on a pretty low graphics setting but only get a max frame rate of 24fps (fps seems to become an issue after about 80 villagers, but at that point some things are too much to manage anyway, so I usually just start another village)",1623979769,1623979769,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The whole ""desirability"" thing for houses is a joke, do you really think that people in the medieval ages cared about where they lived? They lived amongst rats and their own sewerage. But yet they're going to panic if there isn't a flower bush nearby? There aren't a whole lot of ways you can increase desirability. The game gets very repetitive and there isn't much to do other than continue to build more farms and food supply. Designing lord manors and churches is also not that fun, there aren't many building parts, and they aren't customizable. You can only increase the height. Even though I've got heaps of food, my villagers are still complaining they have no food. I have heaps of desirable land for housing, yet it says villagers lack space for housing, and residential space is low, so now I'm not getting immigration. This is what I mean when there are game breaking bugs. It's also extremely slow paced, to the point where it's very annoying.

Much like other titles such as Ostriv or the upcoming Manor Lords, this is non-grid based, instead it's focused on building organic cities with a sense of realism accompanied by dynamic management challenges that come with growing a city. 

I heartily recommend this game for anyone who likes city builders or especially medieval city builders, this game isn't easy, but it's also not as hard as some games to survive in. It isn't hard to not starve your settlement to death, but likewise I've found it a challenge to plan and manage production and resources while keeping a balanced budget and an efficient city design, this game, although relaxing for most of the time, requires some thinking ahead to build efficient cities. 

The art style is very appealing, it isn't hyper realistic in its style, but the buildings and homes adhere to actual designs and styles primarily from Medieval Western Europe. Some people say this isn't worth $30 and I disagree, it has lots of good features, so far I haven't run into any bugs or freezes. I can't comment on the performance otherwise since my laptop is older and starting to show its age. 

The game starts out like most city builders, a few villagers and some resources, you've got to zone and build things. Your villagers build their own homes, wherever they'd like within your zoning, the streets and paths develop mostly organically although you can control them if you want. They require food and depending on their social status, luxury goods or entertainment. It is pretty standard in that sense. The management I don't find particularly tedious. Granaries and storehouses are also significant and as are distribution points like markets. Trade and warfare are two unique aspects of the game which are not totally fleshed out yet but add to the game and provide a good source of cash, which will influence how you decide to build your cities, which is certainly a good thing in my book. 

Special buildings, your manor, churches, monasteries, taverns, and military facilities can be designed by the player. This is a pretty unique feature and very fun. There are some aspects of social management as well, you can collect taxes and require favor from the various estates to be able to advance in certain categories and unlock more advanced buildings. There are a good deal of things  to take into account when starting up, but they're easy to get the hang of. I think, especially as development continues they will become deeper, although I think this game is worth the $ as it is. 

In short, this is a fun and fresh take of medieval city building that presents the player with a relaxing time if he's willing to plan ahead. It isn't too challenging or complex that the beginner will kill off his city several times before being successful, but you won't waltz through this game either if you want to be able to really tailor your city to your exact desires.",1622669999,1622669999,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

(Edit: Maybe I am not the targeted audience for this game. What I'm looking for: a living world. What this is: a pretty looking world that feels dead/synthetic)

I got this game a long time ago (checked purchase history, it was 31 oct 2019... 2019!!!) It is STILL (it's end of march 2021 now) in early access. I have just went for another go at it to see what changed in the last 2 years. Not much, just more bugs (people not making homes, things unlocked suddenly get locked again...). I'm sorry to the devs, but I really can't recommend this.

Edit:
Played some more. Turns out the house building mechanic changed so only commoners (and up) build houses. I don't get it but I guess it's not a bug.

Edit / dev response:
First off, it's nice to see devs caring about feedback.

I understand what you are saying, there were two bigger updates in two years. If your devs play games (which one should if it's your job to make them) they will tell you that a few ""bigger updates"" is nothing for a game in early access. It's fine for a full release to get some content updates that far apart, but for something in development... It just says ""this thing won't be done in half a decade"".

Mechanics:
The newcomer thing is a little silly. If you aren't promoting them, you've got people who are workers (technically, they must be payed something, right?) yet they are homeless. Not to mention they are way better workers as they never leave work (but unrealistic).

Also, people still don't have kids, marry, die, etc.

Soldiers don't do anything / have no purpose, but I guess that's ok for a city builder (not sure what you mean by ""new military system"").

I still play it when I'm listening to podcasts and don't have to think what I'm playing, it is relaxing to build stuff in the game, it's just a shame that there are somewhat complex production chains, yet the people are so shallow. It feels like playing with a zen garden. It looks nice, but feels like a dead world. To elaborate on that one: when I'm making a market, I'm not thinking ""Ah, can't wait to see the people be happy buying what they need here"" it's ""I'l place another market here so peoplebots don't leave my town"".
Yes, I understand that it's easy to be a critic. It might just be that I'm missing the point / looking for something else (added this to the top of the review so people can understand that the game is not bad, it just might not be my cup of tea)",1616883870,1618432345,False,13,0,0.562919676303863525,0,True,False,True

The grid-less mechanic is breath of fresh air after having grown up on standardized city building simulators. Being able to watch the organic growth of your village is a joy, giving it a picture-esque view that is a real beauty to artistic gamers. For the supply line and resource management gamers, hold onto your pickaxes because you're in for an adventure. The game starts you off with a few simple chains to manage, but over the lifespan of your village the amount of resources you can harvest and goods you can produce grows tremendously. I haven't enjoyed a mechanic this much since City:Skylines released their Industrial DLC. 

Many other reviewers have laid out the pros and cons of this game far more efficiently, what with it being in Early Access at this point in time. The main drawback seems to be the pretty hefty price tag, but I didn't have to wait long to snag it in a decent Steam sell. Even then, it's felt worth every penny since I've started playing.

As several other reviewers have said, this game offers a far more controlled gaming experience while pulling in elements of some of our favorite City Builder games. I have played just under 17 hours and will absolutely continue to do so. 

My advice for newcomers: You'll need to watch your 'Happiness' the most. Similar to CIV V this is key to whether or not your village will prosper. If too many villagers feel a certain need is not being met, they will leave. Which opens up holes in your supply chains and therefore economy. Very quickly you can go from thriving to spiraling out of control. 

The biggest part of this comes from the 'promotion' tab. Once you have promoted villagers really to Serf+ (but especially Commoner and Citizen) they start needing more food, luxury goods, and religion. (more on this below in my suggestions to Devs) So be careful when choosing how many people to promote. This is important for happiness, but if you promote too many people too quickly, their luxury needs will start dropping happiness quickly. 

Take advantage of the Military functions. My village has no direct source of Iron, but you get Iron, bread, tools, coin and more from completing military campaigns for the crown. (make sure their swords are quipped before sending them on the mission! I think many of us learned that the hard way)

[u] As an Early Access game, these are some things I think could use some work: [/u]

- So far my game has only crashed twice. Both times it was when I tried to use the 'Walls' tab. 

- I don't personally feel the tutorials go into enough detail and there are several missing. Most of the answers I needed I had to turn to Google/Reddit to find. It took me forever for example, to fully figure out how the warehouse connects to the trade window. Similarly it should be more clear that the 'square' next to a soldier names is where you equip a sword, which is necessary for them to succeed on their mission. Several Reddit threads exist for this since it was not clear. If it says 'Fully Trained' in green next to a soldiers name, we assume they are good to go, not that we are sending them to their deaths.

- Needing 4 churches for a village of 75 people is a bit extreme. I understand religion was especially important during the times in which this game is replicating, but it should be possible to increase the size of an existing church to meet this need instead. I shouldn't need 4 churches in a fairly small town in order to avoid people leaving. Especially with how many resources those take to build. 

- Wine is a luxury good needed for Commoner/Citizen happiness, yet the only way to get that is through trade (-$$$) or building a monastery. I feel we should be able to build a vineyard just like we can harvest hop for beer instead of having to wait until we have 10 citizens and 40 clergy splendor, or spending a ton on it through trade.

- A more picky visual suggestion would be to make the icons for all of the various tabs larger, and to make those tabs a little more graphically pleasing. Since so much of the game is worked through the various tabs and pop-out windows it would be nice if they looked a bit more updated. 

I'm sure I will add more as I continue to play and as they continue to develop the game.

Build an organically laid out medieval Europe village that develops into a town or city in beautiful terrain with detailed structures and a challenging economic system. You'll face varying issues like why are my farmers suddenly planting only 1/2 to 1/3 of the usual amount and causing my people to starve? Why do my markets keep running out of food? Why have my tailors suddenly stopped producing clothes during even though there's an abundance of cloth?  How tall can I really make this Lord Manor tower!?! Managing all of these will require mastering all three games.

After 347 hours of gameplay on the same map with many many restarts, my last save game has 1,300 villagers and a stable economy. Here's what I learned. I consider this game to be a brilliant black box machine with a few tricks to keep one entertained, and well worth the money! I paid full price for this game.

[u]Early Gam / City Builder[/u]

The early game is a city builder. You start by learning the economic chains, watch the development of the organic pathing and residential layouts, and begin laying out your first buildings. You get to piece together your first Lord Manor with beautiful models, infinite variability and options, and discover by hitting the letter [i]t[/i] you are no longer constrained to the pre-determined attachments, but can place parts any which way you choose! 

Somewhere about 150 to 200 villagers, you notice things start to go awry. Your people are starving, can't' find housing, are thirsty, can't get a seat in their local church, their productivity goes to nothing and your economy collapses. You barely have enough money to place a new Gathering Hut, although with the complete food shortage, it wouldn't help anyways, as no new villagers are willing to join your village. What's worse is the markets are bare of food and your hungry people are finally abandoning your village altogether. Why are they all thirsty anyways, I put wells everywhere!

That's when you realize this is not just a city builder, it's also a logistics game, and your logistics needed to be taken into consideration from the very start. Time to restart.

[u]Mid-Game / Logistics Game[/u]

In order to make it into the mid-game, about 150 to 500-650 villagers, you are going to need a good logistics system. Bad weather will starve your production, increasing demand will necessitate markets have supplies closer, and critical manufacturing of goods needs to be organized. The ultimate logistics tool for averaging out problems is the buffer, represented as granaries and warehouses. Having them in the right places with the right mix of raw resources, goods, luxury goods, and foods will get you through the mid-game successfully.

And then you enter the late-game, and once again, your economy begins to collapse in dramatic fashion. You start to notice some weird behaviors - why is the tailor crossing the entire map to get some clothes? By the time he gets home, he needs new clothes, and marches off again across the map, never working again. Doesn't she make her own clothes? Why are thirsty villagers walking right by wells and not stopping to drink? Wha tmakes intuitive sense no longer works in the game. 

Now, however, you have to dig deeper. Using the follow-a-villager in-game tool, you begin to decipher the villager behaviors and learn how the villagers make decisions. Ah, the tailor buys clothes from a market, and the only market with clothes is all the way across the map. The villagers prefer to drink from the well close to home, and home is a long way from work, so they leave in the middle of work to get a drink. The serfs also now live a long way from home because they got kicked out of their original serf home when it was upgraded by a newly-promoted commoner.

And then it hits you - this is not just a city builder, and it's not just a logistics game, it's also a design game. And you have to play all three games at once to be successful through the end game! Time to restart with new information and considerations.

[u]Late Game / Design Game[/u]

In order to thrive through the late game, there are many design considerations to take into account. Designing the well/market/church/work/home layout to optimize villagers, designing the promotion order to maximize work while minimizing villagers moving a long way away, leaving space for future logistics expansion to support an increasingly dense village/town/city while effectively transporting goods across the map, not over-building and increasing your maintenance cost to unsustainable levels whille not underbuilding leading to economic ruin, and preparing supplies for known future expansions that require enormous amounts of materials like the monastery and huge gate. 

When you first play this game, it's just a city builder. But if you fail to play the logistics or design game that is hidden within, your village will come to ruin in the mid to late game.

[u]Tips and Tricks[/u]

[b]Sometimes you have to run the game at 2x or 1x speed.[/b] There came a point when running the game at 3x speed seems to not allow the villager AI to make decisions as fast. This results in, for example, farmers in the sowing season taking a very long time to move on to the next patch of land, and significantly reducing their planting. By slowing the game to 2x, and later to 1x, they went back to planting the full farm.

[b]Buffers, buffers, buffers.[/b] You can average out almost any economic ups and downs with buffers, represented as granaries and warehouses. 

[b]Promote wisely.[/b] The first promotion to serf can dramatically incrase villager efficiency because they will now live close to work and won't travel back to the village center all the time, but hey will also want food, water, and church close by. After that, every promotion will increase your income as the villagers increase income, but their efficiency will reduce because they spend more time filling their needs.

[b]Commoners will kick out serfs.[/b] When you promote a villager to commoner, the first thing they do is upgrade their house. The second thing they do it to kick out all the serfs. This leads to odd situations where you can have a commoner living in a huge 6-person house while 5 serfs now move a long way away from work, reducing their efficiency.

[b]Villagers will out-walk their needs to get their needs met![/b] If a villager wants goods, they will walk across the entire map to a market that has goods. By the time they get home, they will not have time to work because they are hungry, thirsty, need some church/faith, and ... more goods! Failure to ensure your villager needs are available locally at all stages of the game will lead to an economic death-spiral. 

[b]Don't overbuild. Don't underbuild.[/b] In the early game, there's a temptation to both overbuild by placing an extra wheat farm or five, or underbuild by trying to only build the minimum to save money. Overbuilding leads to being unable to pay the building maintenance, and underbuilding leads to not having enough to fill the villagers needs. 

[b]Balance promotion and logistics.[/b] Promoting brings in more money due to consumption, but reduces villager work efficiency because they spend more time filling their needs. Depending on who you promote, you may need to compensate with more production. Some jobs are non-critical and can be promoted whenever, whereas some jobs are critical and need to be promoted carefully.",1617376459,1617446136,True,43,1,0.809589743614196777,0,True,False,True

The controls are generally very good, though I would like to see more key bindings - perhaps I haven't found them yet. There are a few chief concerns with the game though, pieces that are holding it back from being great.

First, when you first start a new world, anywhere you click you immediately purchase that parcel of land and this is unable to be undone. For a first time player, I was just trying to learn if the map was movable by the click and drag in addition to WASD and I found myself purchasing a piece of land that was not ideal for my opening moves. I think a simple confirmation mechanism would solve this. You don't need it on further purchases of land because by that time you have already tested out the mouse movements, but that first one would be helpful to prevent a instant piece of frustration to newcomers.

My second complaint is the lack of some crucial overlays. I would like to be able to see overlays that show me the conditions of the major ""need"" components, for example. When looking at the proposed ""Service"" overlay, you would hope to see an outline or heat-map of certain areas that are being under-served for this need. Likewise, for all other needs, like specific villagers highlighted from an over-world perspective that are in need of whichever need you are selecting, this would aid the player in locating where a need is most heavily felt, as that is very hard to determine otherwise.

And when a villager leaves from unhappiness, there is no clear way to tell what was the tipping point, especially when there are a lot of recently promoted villagers with new needs.

Another overlay I would like to see if one for each ""good"" that is being processed. Perhaps a highlighting of all of the buildings that are interacting with that particular ""good"". For example, gathering huts would have a number over them indicating how many fruit are currently held there, along with any granaries and markets that have them in stock or are set to have them but are out. This would speed up discovery of slow-downs in a particular supply chain.

Overall the game has a ton of potential and I am very eager to continue trying to master it, but these lacking features and the overall lack of clear direction at times makes the game unnecessarily frustrating. I am eager to see an update.",1617425293,1617425293,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros:
* Graphics are cute and overall very polished. Everything looks nice (with the exception noted below) and the people all look awesome. The fact that you can customise the look of larger buildings is extremely cool and buildings adapt to slopes reasonably well. 
* The zoning feature for houses adds a nice touch. You don't have complete control over where your citizens build their houses and that makes it feel much more organic.
* It's atmospheric. Unless you're impatient just letting the music play and watching your people scurry around is quite relaxing 
* There is challenge in balancing the various needs of your people and the expansion of your village, unlocking new features etc. More dangers (see below) would help but for early access it's pretty good.

Cons: 
* It could use a tutorial but if you're familiar with city builders then you'll pick it up quickly and the quests help step you through the major goals
* It's pricey for what you get at the moment so buy on sale if you can
* There are a few graphical issues like some assets floating slightly, especially on slopes. That looks a bit weird when you zoom in and is hopefully going to get a look as the game progresses. 
* A few more threats would help eg: roving bandits, wolves, floods, heat waves etc. The rain event seems to last for ever and gets a bit monotonous.",1617317839,1617317839,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It has all the same issues that other city builders of this type do- distance for your people to travel to work will effect their productivity, distance from storage to sale racks will effect your citizens ability to get items, etc, and instead of finding ways to resolve some of these issues, like having citizens move into houses that are close to their work, they still will build a house halfway across the map then travel to the other side to work for 5 minutes to make the trek back. 

Sure I was low on food at times, but it doesn't run your city numbers down or cause cash flow issues, and even when it does, running out of money doesn't actually hinder you in any way in regards to your cities survival.

Recommended for those who love colony builders with patience.
*BUT* The regular price tag is VERY steep for the games initial offerings. I will try to be more subjective in this by saying it does have better graphics and a little more detail than some games that are similar. Objectively however I am becoming a little weary and frankly a bit disappointed with game creators and the direction they have taken with EARLY ACCESS. 
We get it. The game isn't finished and we can expect bugs while helping fund the remaining game and helping you sort out bugs. That is the trade off and it's a personal decision whether or not to agree to that. In return it should be priced at a lower and more fair price. It seems that tag is more and more becoming an easy way to get the games out earlier and make up funding deficits as they finish. No problem there either, but don't make people pay the final retail price. Charging a price that would seem fair as the final game price for early access titles doesn't seem like a fair trade off, and it seems like customers are beginning to now pay full prices for the benefit of developers, while still having less benefit from a finished game. They are getting their cake, and we are paying full price. In some cases these prices are lining up fairly, but I think we should all be careful what we support in Early Access to keep this in check. This game is priced at what I would say is a fair final purchase price, unless the amount of future content FAR outweighs what it seems plausible as of now. 

GRAPHICS - Very good for a colony builder. The little people have actions and animations, though the variety isn't that tremendous as far as their looks. The maps are very pretty and the overall game is pretty gorgeous. 
I run it on max graphics with an I-7 1070 and 32gb and it has no problems. If you need lower settings, I did try those and cant tell a difference that would make the game less enjoyable to look at. 
MECHANICS - The mechanics of managing the city and the building aspects are pretty well thought out. There are some nuances you will need to get used to, as there are some features you may not have found in other games. For example: You can build certain structures with multiple options or add to them later for extra space or assigning them extra utility values. This can be a little hard to get used to early on, as I have found myself wondering why a building wasn't being built, only to discover I never finished selecting the required parts and hit build. Finding whats wrong with unhappy people could use more detail. It may tell you overall what is wrong with some, but there could be more specifics. 
GAMEPLAY - The game plays well and has some challenge to it but will allow you time to get through the challenges without an instant death of your hard earned colony. I have found that food sources are some of the early inhibitors with colony growth because your colony will seem slow to advance in the first little while, then all of a sudden bursting at the seams with new people. You will have to set up ways to sell the raw materials you collect to your own villagers in order to afford to promote people and do any trading. The trading function, speaking of, is not as fleshed out as I think it could be. There is not as much detail on when they will trade, if trades have been completed, etc. Overall it has a good balance of challenge and relaxing design elements to keep me interested early on. 

A few small gripes - There are some particular areas of the game that need more detail and the map selection could be more diverse and larger. (Once you select the starting area, you will have to use your colony's funds to purchase more land. The areas you can purchase are limited by the needs of your colony and their proximity.) In addition, there could be a little better balance of raw material and food to collect in the limited starting areas you are given access to. 

It's worth a play if you like Banished and End Zone - games such as those, but if it is not a die hard passion, wait for a sale. You won't be missing anything that unique and you can hold off until the price is down.",1615687239,1615687239,True,97,2,0.865016400814056396,5,True,False,True

This review is taking place during EA, which is always a little unfair. However, needs must. The game is quite enjoyable. At this point in time, it looks like most of the game is there. Graphically its OK. Although the UI does need work - especially when it comes to scaling... 

In terms of gameplay, yes its OK. Reminds me the most of Cultures in terms of gameplay. Will be interesting to see what the final version resembles. It is slow paced though and that is one of the faults, to my mind, as it's too slow. Another issue is with the AI of far travelling characters - i.e. builders. They will walk across the map with all their needs already empty, go to the building site, hit it once, and then turn round to go home to fulfil their needs. Why they couldn't top off before they left? It does slow down an already slow process.  

I will say that after almost 17 hours of game time, I'm not sure what else is left to do, and I feel like I'm done with the game. So the Price/Hour is quite high, especially for a game of this type. But I enjoyed those hours, and I would recommend picking it up in a sale.

If you, like me, are looking for a ""castle building"" game, and don't mind using mods, then this game might just be for you!  The modding community in this game is active, talented, and does some really awesome castle stuff!

If you are looking for a charming, chill, medieval city builder, and don't mind using mods, then this game just might be for you!  Again, the modding community creates some absolutely wonderful stuff!

Actually, even if you don't like using mods, this game might be for you!  Heck, I played my first 500+ hours in plane vanella.  The base game is excellent.  The devs are communicative, and helpful.  Ash is great!  If you are concerned that this EA game will be abandoned, I don't think that you should be concerned.

If you are looking for a ""hard core"" game, then this probably isn't the game for you.  I've spent roughly 10K hours in Paradox games (EUIII/EUIV and Stellaris), and relative to those types of games, this game is ""cake walk"".

IIRC this game cost me $29.  As far as I'm concerned, it has been worth every penny spent.

Updated Review - Nov 21
It's very addicting and as a result a huge letdown, so I'm actually really frustrated as I write this. Buy this game if you are a glutton for punishment and are OK with starting a game up that will likely end with rage and an empty promise to yourself to never play again (hah). This is the second...now third....time I have reviewed this game, and in the end my recommendation isn't changing basically because of how frustrated I become with every game into which I invest my time. At first I was delighted with the concept that road networks were formed organically by my villagers, and this got me excited to see how things end up in the end stages if I grow a village organically, but that appeal soon became overshadowed by how tedious it is to manage everything once a village is really scaling up. This last game I played was going wonderfully until suddenly my happiness went from constant 100 and started crashing. I had 3-4 churches up (2 more in the works) and food stalls everywhere, but still the population was failing to get access to food and service. I think this is partly due to the town center being crowded and patrons refuse to congregate in other areas where the food stalls are less crowded. I could not build enough food stalls to fix the problem, and the trading info was confusing (I suspect trade has something to do with supply chain flow but information is limited). It is INCREDIBLY difficult to manage the supply chain in this game because of how tedious things are set up. I've actually come to appreciate the smaller UI windows more than I used to because I can keep them open on the side of the window, but they still are of little use when management comes down to using the ""zoom in"" function on people, and very unhappy to report that the “View Home” function is USELESS and doesn’t work, making it impossible to ascertain whether a food vendor is spending too much time walking to work, etc. So far, every time I play this game I seem to hit a wall that essentially totally tanks a perfectly played game at a random point. I was flying through early stages just scrambling to spend gold before my coffers filled up. I had maximum happiness, it was going beautifully...then suddenly happiness started CRASHING due to service and food issues and while I did my best to try and identify the source of the problem and fix it, my village literally just tanked way too fast for it to be possible. I am more frustrated than challenged by this game. I am not satisfied and every damn time I think I can do a better early game to avoid the mess towards the end but every time it’s the same thing. Regret and hair pulling.  I just feel like I could fix these problems if I could make more sense of what is going on. I can identify the issues but still struggling with resolving them with the tools, info, and UI I currently have.

(Old Review)

Now, I seem to have all the basics covered and mastered what I need to do. I know I need to place out lots of wells to create desirable housing areas, and those areas also need to feature quick access to food carts and churches.  After a few hours I get to the point where income isn't the issue (in fact I was scrambling to upgrade my treasury to hold more gold for a bit there), but managing resources is and the only way you can really do is using a small window that lists all your buildings, allows you to zoom in on their location, and then manage said building remotely.  It just gets really tedious, and I am immediately turned off and the game suddenly makes me want to moan with annoyance.  So I just close it.  Next time I start a new game and think the experience will be better, but all that happens is that I spend even less time reaching that point. I don’t mind micro-management, but I don’t really feel set up for success in that regard. 

My most recent village is up to over 230+ villagers and frankly I found that part really easy and getting to that point rather satisfying, but the problem is that the game loses allure shortly thereafter because it's just a huge mess of a series of tiny UI windows and micro-managing independently. The game really is addictive, but ultimately the UI and resource management leaves enough to be desired that it's enough of a turn off for me to legit not want to recommend it.

So, my problem isn't that the game is hard. Frankly, once I figured out how to create loads of desirable land the game got really easy until there was just too much to manage in any satisfying manner.  I am really disappointed and annoyed at the idea of starting yet another game.

May 2020 Update/Edit: I'm actually really glad that my review and the Dev's reply has been able to help people, even if some people are bothered by my review of the game. It's a delight to know that the UI is one of the things that they are addressing and makes me excited to go back and play the game and give it another chance. While some may think their response may merit my editing the review, I feel to do so before getting around to replaying it would be disingenuous, and it seems that even with this sitting at a negative, it is still drawing attention and helping people to decide to purchase the game, so it's a win-win.

Building Grievances:

-Placing Crosses on steeples always go sideways, have to manually rotate after
-Base height is relative to ground level, cannot use subtle height changes to create a flush appearance as the ground level is the problem.
-While building, must rotate cam constantly to prevent obstacles from being a nuisance while trying to select things.
-View Home Function doesn’t work - making it impossible to make work locations efficient",1585933685,1614324100,False,321,5,0.906264603137969971,23,True,True,True

So expansion has to be extremely carefully planned.  I had a city of 420 people that had the economy completely crash because of a clothing shortage.  My citizens in important roles, like creating flour or producing wheat, were instead running across the map.  So not only did I have a clothing problem, it soon spiraled into a food problem.  It can be fixed, simply by putting newcomers and serfs into new positions (as tailers, etc) and then when the situation resets you have an insane abundance.  Part of the fun is in the balance you create by insane micromanagement.  If that's not your vibe you might not enjoy this, but I find it extremely engaging and fun (though I would like to see some improvement in AI efficiency - for example, while across the map in search of clothing, why not also visit the church and market? Why fly all the way across the map in search of another church or market? and before you say my church was full - it wasn't!)",1614309996,1614309996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

 Music, ambient, cuteness of the characters, all the ingredients are present.

 If you don't know Settlers (you should!) it's medieval village construction and management. A kind of Simcity where you meet each of your citizens up close and personal. If you take good care of them, more will come to your village and you can grow, expand, unlock new resources, etc.

 Only the direct combat with neighbors is absent. If you realy like the military side of it in Settlers, you will perhaps miss it here. There's military in Foundation, but the troops are sent to fight far away for the king, we don't witness any fights, only local training and patrolling.

The visuals and the audio is also really nice and fitting, get you in a really nice, calm mindset, where you don't feel pressure, and you can just flow with the game.

There are some objectives you can do, some mission, achievements, but it's mostly about general expansion, and keeping up with the balance of ppl, workplaces, food etc. This also adds to the chill feeling, you rarely feel the pressure to build something. The monument building mechanic allows you to decorate and structure your important buildings as you wish, making them pretty unique.

CONS: The game here and there have some minor bugs, and missing ingame frame limiter, thus it will eat up your resources, if you don't use any external limiters (only vsync option, but it doesn't help at all if you don't use a 60hz monitor) - although even with bigger towns, 100+ fps is not impossible with a nice hw on  max settings, so the optimization is quite nice.

Despite having been in Alpha for quite some time, game still is very buggy.

For me, it was the AI's refusal to build houses for themselves, no matter how attractive the area, how close to their work or no matter how much space i provided. When looking over the forums, the developer would simply answer ""There's no evidence to support housing is broken"", despite countless examples from players, and then eventually lock the thread so the matter was easier to ignore. With post going back to 2019, the bug was still not fixed two years later.

Struggling a bit to keep inventory full, no comprehensive menu for tracking inventory and storage. The game needs a better tutorial and I wish we had one more speed increase!

I've been looking for a game that combined this kind of graphics and building ability (kind of like Sims) with the city building game play of Banished. This is it! Took me a minute to figure it out and get into it, the menus (symbols and fonts) are small and there isn't much of a tutorial so it has taken some trial and error. I restarted like four times before I finally built a town that I've been able to keep advancing with. It's not easy but it's fun! You have to sell resources to make money, but you can't expand to get access to more resources without money so... and the trading doesn't set you up, really. You can't buy bread from anyone until you can create bread... you can't buy clothes until your town CREATES clothes. Feel me? It took me a couple tries, let's just say.  I need a better tutorial on how trading works because I can't seem to stock pile enough food myself even though I have several wheat farms/windmills/bakeries, and gathering huts. Also why is there only one fisherman per dock? Would be nice to have two at least - one to fish and one to move inventory so I could actually start to stockpile some fish! 

It's quite repetitive in how you start a town and there are only a handful of maps but they're neat, I've started on all of them so far. I wish there was a better, more comprehensive way to track inventory. Currently there's a list of all resources but I don't know which resources I've stored in which warehouses without clicking on them ALL and bringing up a cumbersome and large menu for every..single..warehouse. And there's no way to rename them or distinguish them so I have to remember the order I built them or click on all of them and look individually. It also irks me that we can't assign available swords to all available military in one click - I have to assign all 100+ swords individually. Still, I continue playing and figuring it out and enjoying it. There's a lot going on and the menus are small for my old eyes. I looove the aspect of building custom churches, manors, and keeps. I like that the people build houses and trails organically though I wish I had control over deleting roads. So far I do recommend!

The only things missing is making it easier to do certain tasks, like:

Making it easier to not send wounded soldiers into battle.
Knowing which granaries and warehouses are full of x resource
Knowing which workplaces are idle without checking them one by one to make everything more efficient.

And i would really like it if they would make all the land you don't own not visible as this would make it more fun to expand, maybe add a scouting option, because late game you got all the main resources you want since you know exactly where to expand to to get it.

I wish there were more maps to play on (only 5).   The Hills map is unappealing as it doesn't even have a lake which seems unrealistic as I think most olden days settlers the first requirement was finding abundant fresh water.  (Even desert settlements were were like Egypt on a river or at least at an oasis.) The mountains look nice but the camera has trouble handling the level shifts and gets annoying.  The fluvial map has a nice look but overall too flat -needs a few hilly places so can build your fortress and monuments on high ground.   I like the coastal map a lot and I'm currently in the river valley map which is pretty nice as well.

I'm hoping the map situation will improve with time as variety would be nice.  Would love to build an Egyptian  themed desert city as well - so maybe there will be add-on packs or mods later.

Art: Gorgeous graphics with the exception of the villager drawings. While there's something charming about the amateur style art, it's inconsistent and someone who is ""18"" will be drawn as an old man with a beard. The modeled structures, the trees, and the grass are all lovely, though.

Trading: This needs the most work as the help menu is incredibly vague here and it is hard to tell if you've got your settings right. There are just too many moving parts (warehouses are a frustrating complication that feel inconsistent. Sometimes you produce enough of a good to meet a goal but it isn't in your warehouse. Sometimes you have fifty of something but when you assign it to a warehouse it shows three and you can't find the other 47?) Either the help menu needs to be clear or this needs simplification.

Progression: It took me five hours to produce cloth, but it wasn't clear how I could trade to get it, and a lot of early buildings required cloth. It just felt like magic when I had it because I still don't understand where it was coming from before I unlocked sheep. Same with tools. Trading for these things didn't seem to work because I couldn't unlock trading partners who sold them? Needs work.

My major issue is that once you start getting up to a few hundred people and promoting to serfs, commoners, citizens, it seems the resource management gets a bit messy. I have yet to have a town with 300 people that doesn't need an absolutely absurd amount of food production and clothing production that it's more villagers than I even have needed to work. 
Because there is so much food and clothing required I can't move forward into many citizens because it's simply not possible to have enough workers to produce luxury as well. 

If they could rework the resource requirement or production rate so I don't need 100 gathering huts, 50 wheat farms/windmills/bakery, ect ect for a couple hundred villagers it would honestly feel more natural, because lets be real no village ever had more food production than people.

I really liked the idea of building a medieval city, since I thought it would be a game along the lines of SimCity, Cities: Skylines, and other city building simulators.

Firstly, the AI is terrible and really put me off. There was another review saying this and I didn't think it could be that terrible. Wrong. Makes the game unnecesarily hard.
I also must point out that it is also a quite slow game (even though some people might not mind that) and it would take literal  AGES to build something like what the game trailer shows, not only because the AI wouldn't build houses where it should (you only place buildings, the game sorts the housing out by itself) but because pleasing villagers is hard af. No indicators of what could be done to make them happier or if there is any sort of problem -  you have to guess all that yourself.
To top it off, I hated the interface. Not intuitive at all, the most useful buttons are scattered all over the panel and it even looks a bit outdated, as if the game was old. Visually it wasn't very nice, not to mention how uncomfortable the button thing was.
I  bought this game while on sale and I actually had to return it because I couldn't make it past half an hour of gameplay.

Foundation is a city builder that combines elements from banished, and city skylines, two of my favourite, and arguably, the best city builders in the market.

+Good ideas borrowed from cities skylines
+Relaxing music
+Easy to get into
+Areas of opportunity can make for a lot of content

-Tutorial is not easily laid out
-Early Access related bugs
-Still clearly a lot of development to be done

Foundation starts you off on a plot of land, similar to Cities Skylines does. After earning enough coin, the main currency of the game, you can expand by purchasing more land. It is crucial that more land is purchased for expansion in order to maximise profits and earn access to mineral deposits such as iron and gold.

Residential areas for your citizens are also similar to CS where you determine a plot of land can be used for building houses using a brush. The citizens build houses as needed and also automatically upgrade the buildings depending on their class level.

You earn gold by selling food and goods to your citizens but also by trading your resources with other factions. Trades like those happen automatically and are incredibly easy to set up. A little more expansion on the trades would be a good idea in order to make it a tiny bit more challenging and add some more logistics to it. 

There are missions you can take such as delivering a certain amount of goods to either the people, the king, or the clergy in order to receive more favour points from each faction. The more points you have, the more unique buildings you can unlock. That is however one of the two criteria that determine whether or not a building can be unlocked.

The other criteria is the status of your citizens. Every beginning of the month, you are able to promote your citizen class to a higher grade. Each grade gets progressively more expensive to achieve, and costs more gold coin than the previous one. Buildings unlock by having more citizens with higher status. As your citizens' status increases, so will their needs too. It is important to keep your citizen's needs fulfilled in order to avoid them leaving your establishment. It is quite easy to keep their needs fulfilled however since there are really not that many needs to begin with. Think of Anno when you picture this mechanic if you have ever played that game.

From there and on, the game is pretty self explanatory on how it works at its core. You gather resources, you build buildings to gather different resources and so forth. It is nice to see all these mechanics from the three giants squished into one game. I am not sure if the final product will represent this idea in a better way, but although this early access version of the game is quite rough around the edges, there is premise to be delivered here.",1613096029,1613096029,True,1,0,0.521531105041503906,0,True,False,True

PROS:  

Foundation is artistically very appealing and I mostly enjoy the city-building (with some clear cons listed below).  At this point, it's not at all difficult to make a profitable economy, but you'll soon find yourself running out of gold storage - forcing you to expand your Lord's Manor in order to add more components (basically parts of the manor) that can serve as treasuries (to increase your gold cap).  

CONS: 

There are in-game mechanics that can be frustrating, specifically the fact that your people build their own housing (and improve and expand their housing based on their ""citizenship"" status) and seem to require a very large space to do so.  This can really curtail your city-building efforts and even distort your original city design/plan.  

And it's not enough to just designate some distant tract of land for a future suburb.  Your people (depending on their citizenship status/rank) can get really picky when it comes to their housing needs.  They like living close to work and the higher their status, the better environmental quality they desire.  This requires you to tediously and strategically coordinate citizen rank to their job and their job location.  

If, for example. you've promoted a citizen, who lives near a low environmentally quality area because they that's just the nature of their job, then you'll quickly find their happiness dwindling - which will bring down your overall happiness rating.  And with a low enough rating, your people will leave, which can begin to snowball into bigger issues.  And this kind of micro-managing can be discouraging.  

Another problem that I'm running into is the random spawning of certain critical minerals (like gold, marble, iron, etc.).  In every game I've started so far, iron, a very early game resource has never spawned withing reach, which severely limits your ability to produce necessary tools and weapons - and that leads to your progress slowing or stifling.  

RECOMMENDING

If there was a way to see how these promotions would affect the economy before doing it then the problem would be solved. 

Another issue that I had was with painting zones - there is no easy way to see the effective range of your production buildings. It can be learned over time by playing the game, but it would be nice to have some sort of visualization.

So the newest update V1.6.26 basically killed the game for me.  I've been playing off and on for awhile now, and there is no tutorial (still).  So after this newest update, everything has hashtags in front of them, which really jacks up the UI.  It makes an already crowded and confusing UI even worse by adding something that is not needed.  Now i know that the game is still EA but the last time i played, it didn't have that.  I spent the better part of 5 minutes looking for the next building and i couldn't find it, so i went to the help section.  Guess what ?  Yeah, major league jacked up.  No help at all.  With this release it almost feels likes its back in early alpha, going backwards, and not forward.  Some of this i can forgive, like i said, its EA, it comes with the territory.  But in this most recent sit down, the sound inexplicably stutters, then clicks, then boom, i have a fog horn going off in my living room.  The only way to get it to stop...turn of the sound or exit the game entirely.  I have about 12 hrs into this game, and i am major league disappointed in the direction its going.  The biggest issue i have with the game in general, it has no tutorial!  It needs one, badly.  I dont want to have to search youtube to learn how to play a game before i can sit down and enjoy the game.  Even a basic 5 minute getting started tutorial would be enough.  I will revisit after the next update, but in its current iteration, i can't/wouldn't tell my friends to drop 30 bucks on this.  In needs major work at this point.

Things I like;
+It's really a calm game with nice music. 
+Natural town with auto-created roads and homes.
+Unique atmosphere with sweet graphics and cool UI.
+Modular builds for some structures allow freedom for creation. 

Things I hate;
-I really hate distance. Villagers don't work 250m away from home. The villagers don't go to a market or a well that's 250m away. Because of this, it's impossible to create a town center. Everything has to be expanded wide and separately.
Come on! You're living in a small village. What do you expect? 

-Hexagon expansion doesn't make sense for a game like this. 

-Lack of control. 
*Although I like auto-created roads, in some situations its looks simple ugly. There are ways to manipulate roads with zones and walls but it's not effective. We should be able to draw roads. 
*Some villagers will take a long route and lose a lot of time. So I can't maximize efficiency.
*Crazy sheeps and cows goes wherever they want inside the building's circle.

-Lack of information. 
*On events like villagers leaving town, I don't know who and why is leaving. 
*No information for the production chain. I can't see bottlenecks or surplus. 
*Warning messages don't provide any solution and they don't make sense at all. 
*Villager needs. When it says there is a villager who doesn't have access to food, water, etc. again I can't see who, where, and why...

I think there are a great many things that are good about this game, especially the way you can customise and shape the buildings, but there were two main factors that, at least at the time of this review, that really stood out to make the game frustrating for me personally.

1. Lack of control over the layout
I love the way you can demarcate different areas easily, but the game does not let you control where houses are specifically placed, or where roads go.  Roads form where people walk the most, and house placement is random within the demarcated areas.  

The road placement is an annoyance for town planning, and while there are some ways around it, such as the use of walls or forbidden areas to force the UI to adhere to your layout, it isn't foolproof.  The same can be said of resident housing.  I was often frustrated to offer a rather large area for housing, and residents simply wouldn't use it, for whatever reason, only to make  it a touch bigger, and then suddenly three houses were upon it.  And then I would be inundated by ""I can't get in my house."" ""I can't get in my house""  ""I can't get in my house"" because they built them too close together, and when residents got upgraded, the houses grew larger and blocked entrance to the ones beside it.   All that would be avoided if the game had just let me place the houses myself.  The same happened when I was using walls to block areas from being walked over due to the road issue, and then houses were built and the doorway was on the wall.

2. The fast forward in time function isn't fast enough.  
Currently you can fast forward the game x3, but for a cautious player such as myself, who likes to ensure there is more stockpiling and careful planning in the game, I often found myself allowing more time to pass, and the time spent waiting around felt far too tedious.  Other games of the same genre have up to x5 or so, which would be far better.  I can only hope they add increased speed to the game before official launch.

The speed issue feels like it links in with the first issue of town planning, because if the game allowed me more control over the town planning, I could be spending that time carefully laying roads myself, putting down foundations for resident housing etc, but instead the game seems to lean towards encouraging the players to avoid as much meticulous planning in favour of speeding the game, but then doesn't have the speed to make that work as well, for me at least.  

In summary, I think if they added a greater speed option, as well as the ability (perhaps selected at map creation) to allow players to plan their territory with a greater control, then I would recommend this game.  But, as it stands, it just doesn't work for me as well as some other games of this type.  I would love to see these edits though, because the customisation of the buildings was great!",1612728404,1612728404,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

I don't think there's any way to win at the moment (?), but the challenge is fair enough.
It's very much in the lane of Settlers and Anno, but somehow I prefer the villager management in this game rather than Anno. Maybe because attracting new villagers feels more specific and rewarding here. Every villager counts, so you want to make them happy.

Right now I think the biggest game challenge is to figure out why the production lines get ineffective when the town grows. I noticed the villagers are walking off from work to the markets and church, so I think it's important to have these things close to where every villagers work and live. Not just have a market and a church, but to make sure the nearby shops actually have surplus goods, and the church must have spare seating. If not, the villagers will either gather up, wait and give up, or they will spend extra time walking to the next alternative.

A good feature would be an overview of where each villager tends to walk, which areas tend to crop up with people, and which stores\churches are often unable to meet demands.",1612715049,1612715049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
690830,86146084,76561198011418015,0,1,509,0,509,1612723514,"Alright folks, do consider this to be a first impressions review. I've only owned this game for a few days and have only put several hours into it.

I usually don't buy Early Access games. This is my first one actually. They have a legacy of being unfinished products, filled with bugs and feeling what they are: unfinished. Truth be told, I haven't encountered any of these issues yet. Sure I've only played several hours, but there are finished games with bugs within the first few hours of playing.

Now, why did I buy this game? Surely I broke my own rule. I didn't read any reviews or watch Youtube playthrough. What struck me was the looks of the game. It looks a lot like Settlers VI or even Knights and Merchants, a game a played for hours and hours when I was a kid.

My first impressions, what do I like and what do I dislike?

+ To start, I love the game speed. This feels like one of those games I played years ago. Where nothing can happen for minutes of game time and you can forget to pause, come back from making coffee and your town isn't burned down yet. The village will manage itself, but it might just take several minutes for some buildings to be build, so why not get some coffee or snacks in the meantime anyway? In this way this game reminds me of Anno 1602 or Knights & Merchants, where you'd have to wait for the villagers to gather the stone from the stonemason, before you'd be able to complete a certain building. If that's not your thing and you easely get annoyed by the builder taking a food break instead of finishing that farm, I would advice you to look a little further.

+ Graphics and gameplay is great. Feels somewhat like the original Black & White and above mentioned Knights & Merchants. Your town grows organically and your villagers feel to have minds of their own. There's no grid, you can place and rotate however you like. Villagers will find their way and their steps carve out a road in the landscape. Sure, pathfinding can sometimes do with some tweaking - I'm not into straight lines in medieval landscapes - but remember, this is an alpha.

+ UI reminds of the old days. I've understood they're working on a new UI, but I like the current one in looks and feel. Reminds me of Rollercoaster Tycoon actually. It's not on of those UI's where they've hidden all menus behind right clicks and you easely close it by clicking the wrong mouse button.

- Now, the UI also has some issues. Villager happiness and resource management is important, but I struggle to find out how my villagers are doing. I have to click each of them to see whether they are happy or not. I haven't found a way to see overall happiness of my serfs or commoners. With such knowledge you'd know what's lacking and what I should invest in. Same thing for resources and stockpiles. If my cloth is low I struggle to find whether that's due to me not having enough sheep, sheep farms or farmers or whether it's due to the weaver underperforming.

- Quests and missions are one of those game mechanics that certainly feel unpolished. I didn't really bother with them. Yes they are useful and can give you good rewards, but often it was easier to skip them and safe the food I had to send to the king.

Now, this is still an unfinished game and it could still do with a lot of improvement. Personally I'd love to see the villages you trade with as small villages in the corners of the map, instead of off the map. It would just add some flavour to the game.

Should you buy this game? Probably? Are you into old-fashioned games like Settlers, Anno, Black & White, Knights & Merchants? In that case: yes, give this game a go.

The game will allow you to start your city in areas that are inaccessible to newcomers (little islands between rivers without a bridge to the other side). Yet, the game doesn't give you free choice of where to start. You have to choose from pre-selected options.

Some mechanics make the game more difficult without necessity - strange money cap, which happens to be the amount necessary to buy new land, so you have to click over and over until you purchase successfully; characters saying they can't find berries/stone, presumably due to over farming, but you can still clearly see the berries and stone; the introduction to controls is all at the beginning, rather than as the game is going, so if you don't read the instructions, there's no tutorial - you'll end up having to google a lot of things, like how to mine from the mountainside, which requires that you inspect it first using a character from your royal manor.

After you play for an extended time and have a larger city, it becomes complicated to manage all the characters and jobs. The bottom left lets you see a list of your buildings, so you can see where there's an opening. You also can see a list of characters to assign jobs. None of the characters will automatically fill a vacant roll. When you're really into the game, you tend to forget to check if characters joined you, then they get mad about not having a job, and it tanks your happiness.

Even still, it's a very addictive game. It's a fun, new city builder, that gives me some memories of Pharaoh/Cleopatra. I look forward to the changes that they make in the final version.

690830,86051516,76561198031817530,0,33,2120,0,807,1612729541,"TLDR:  A fun, lazy, and easy going early game followed by a maddeningly poor design and coding for mid-game.  There's no ""survival"" or combat, just town building to meet the peasants needs at 3 stages of advancement.  AI get confused about how to meet their needs and prioritize their time as settlement expands.

Main review:  I really want to like and recommend this game, but it's obvious the devs haven't done a full playthrough or they'd recognize and address some glaring issues. If they do so, I'll adjust the rating.

I have to agree with other reviewers who point out that the mid-game ""unhappiness"" is broken.  This mechanic simply needs to be removed until it's reworked and properly balanced....OR, players should be able to execute residents who wish to ""leave"".  For each traitorous peasant executed the risk of further desertions would go down.  For a real world example of this, look at North Korea.  Sure, living there isn't nice...but it's better than trying to leave.  

Again, a little proper balance goes long way.  Such balance would include the developer breaking up the cascade failure that occurs with the currently broken unhappiness mechanic.  It works like this: 
1) Everything is fine
2) People keep coming to your town (no way to stop them)
3) Your peasants begin to turn unhappy from something (usually poor ai, more on that later)
4) Whatever made them unhappy causes people to start leaving
5) You now won't have the population to fix the original problem AND...
6) Now there aren't enough people to maintain everything that was fine, which leads to further people leaving
7) Return to step 6 and repeat

From a population level of 95 (everything fine), it dropped to 73 before I'd managed to patch MOST of the unhappiness holes.  With ""everything fine"" 2 more people left because of transient unhappiness issues (bad ai coding). It took about 2 hours real time, at normal speed, for me to get people to stop leaving.  Ridiculous, considering everything was ""fine"" right up until the cascade began.

Population unhappiness is often out of the players control.  You can't tell your people where to live, look for food, look for water, or go to church.  They are VERY bad at finding suitable locations on their own and they are TERRIBLE at prioritizing.  They will walk past a food vendor to go to church.  Then they'll walk to their job.  Then they'll turn around and go back to the food vendor, passing the well.  Then they'll go home.  Then back to the well for a drink, and then repeat this nonsense cycle over again.  

While they're wandering around aimlessly (SERPENTINE, RUN SERPENTINE!), their ""needs met"" status bars deplete.  This leads to a transient unhappiness because if they ever get around to hitting the right spots, they'll fill up their needs bars.  Well, they took to long sightseeing, got unhappy and left.  

Ironically, your bailiff (your ""right hand man""), is ALWAYS on the brink of leaving because, since he's out on tasks, his bars are usually depleted.  A simple fix would be to make him immune while he's on a task.  This type of glaring design error shows that the devs haven't done a full playthrough.

A BIG cause of this is being unable to find housing close to their job.  YOU can't build housing.   You designate residential zones and then the ai blithely ignores putting a house in a spot that would solve that person's need.  YOU can't tell them to live in a house near their job.  If Resident A picked a bad housing location far from his work and Resident B now must also pick a bad spot because Resident A is in the house Resident B needs, they BOTH get unhappy.  

So, even if you patch up all the unhappiness holes, you still still have unhappy people because they can't figure out how to reasonably meet their needs even though everything is available to them. 

Improvement suggestions:  
1) Fix the broken code in the ai needs priority and pathing
2) Fix the broken code in happiness leading to cascade failure
3) Allow executions of departing citizens to ""encourage"" others to stay (fun stop gap until the developer gets the code fixed).
4) Workers should RETAIN skill training they've acquired on the job, ESPECIALLY when keeping the same job, just changing locations (currently, if you fire a skill 5 transporter to move them to your new warehouse, they start off at the new location as skill 1).  This design error only helps feed the cascade failure as you have to move your fewer peasants around to cover needed jobs.
5) Once placed, buildings that affect the desirability of land (red or green circle) should continue to show their circle of area of affect (currently once placed, you can only tell the building's exact reach by selecting the building as if you were attempting to construct it and holding the ghost over the one already placed to give you a temporary glimpse of the radius).  This is a super annoying and glaring oversight in design by devs who haven't played their own game.

Edit, after writing this review, my mill stopped working (changed workers, destroyed, rebuilt in a different spot, changed workers again) and it wouldn't turn grain into flour, the people wouldn't go to it, but they would go to other jobs.

Management is available from service-needs end or from service-available end - that is there are multiple methods to connect villagers with needed or available work.  They make their own housing is great, as is the automatic roadmaking, and best of all NO GRIDS!!  My village is growing the way it would - organically, and beautifully.
The people walk thru buildings, but around individual trees.  They pick up and put down crates, which then are removed from or added to what's there... There is huge love that's gone into this title and I am in love with the result.

It is very similar Banished but instead of managing health and preventing starvation, you manage needs and happiness. Population growth is only from immigration, which only happens if your current population is happy enough. There are many cool mechanics that aren't present in Banished, such as promoting villagers from Serfs to Commoners to Citizens and others. The middle ages theme is great.

TL;DR - This game is the next great City Builder.

Full explanation:

I've been playing city building games since the days of Pharaoh, Caesar, and Sim City/2000. Every year, I pray to the Gods of resource management that a worthy successor to the giants that came before it will come and bless this genre. Despite signs of life, the likes of Cities: Skylines, Urban Empire, and the offshoot genres like Aven Colony and Frostpunk/They Are Billions... nothing has scratched that itch. You're better off playing RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 or trying your best to set your Banished mods up to perfection rather than playing most of the year in year out titles. Tropico has been on a steady spiral downwards of repetitive gameplay saved only by polish since Pirate Cove, and the sleek shine of Anno always falls short of the gamers lofty expectations going in based on my own and friends/family members' experience with the series.

Then, I happen upon Foundation. Its like a cross between Caesar meets The Settlers in the best way, with a little Banished thrown in. Even in its unfinished Alpha state, it gives my previous recent favorite, Dawn of Man, a serious run for its marbles. This game will be nothing short of a masterpiece by time of full completion. I don't miss on these things, the last game to get this level of recommendation from me was Mount & Blade: Warband when it first released.

True depth and freedom to build, with just the right level of micro and macro management, a great look, and by far the best frame-by-frame building progress I've ever seen... reminding me of what we all hoped Age of Empires 3 would be way back when.

Buy it now on discount, or forever regret it and pay full price for it later, but whatever happens... do not miss this game.

10/10, would recommend to a friend.

Pros: Wonderful Graphics... A. As aforementioned, best frame-by-frame construction process I've seen to date. Makes watching your hamlet and village stage growing never seem dull even without much going on. B. Combination of the Avatar toons for the townsfolk (slightly cartoonish, but very well done) as well as the on-era portrait work on their information tab gives you a solid picture of who that person really is in a different plane of existence. C. UI/Menu Graphics, Even in its unpolished Alpha state informative and concise, allowing a person to quickly learn the mechanics.
Grid-free Building Mechanic - This allows you to really spread out, the paths are where your people walk and feel organic. The whole growth of the game is excellently designed to deliver on the promisedf 'organic growth feeling'
Building Customization - Fantastic feature that allows you to customize all major buildings. Each market, church, keep, manor, and wall (as well as many more!) will be tailor made to suit your needs, and can be edited in the future. Again adds to the feeling of natural growth and development.
Soundtrack - Clean, crisp, ambient, and immersive. While never taking your breath away, it delivers on background noise to keep your focus where it should be. On growing your Fief!
More On UI - Easy to understand, with plenty of small features and intuitive additions that help one go from bumbling around to a master of all one can click in a matter of minutes.. not hours, a friendly, and robust UI that allows the game to feel like the overlays are truly there to help you and not to hold you back.
Price - This game could easily charge $45 just for the base. It likely will be that price on completion, not to mention once they start filling out there amazing base game with must-play expansion content. Getting it now, and especially on sale (Got it after tax with soundtrack for ~$26 U.S.) is a true bargain.

Neutral: Early Access - This means that although you will be along for the ride and seeing all types of new things come out as you already master the basics in this far from bare-bones but equally far from finished version, it likely is pretty far from a state where a dedicated mod community will take over and turn the base game from masterpiece into Genre Game of the Decade contender. Will have to have patience with some areas where we would like to see overnight improvement, but also get the experience of a random Tuesday turning into ""oh look a new Major Foundation update, nice!"" day too.

Cons: Too Fun - Already, I can feel the jealous glares of Cyberpunk, Valhalla, Rimworld, and many others burning into my soul. They know that me having found this game has reduced their playtime by 1/2 for the forseeable future. MY OWN timelines for finishing said games went from ""Eh, a few weeks.. tops."" to ""Uhhhhhhhh, inevitably. Before the world ends. Well, probably. World sending mixed signals on how long that's gonna be.""


In Conclusion: You didn't know you needed this game. If you enjoyed Banished, Caesar, Settlers, or any copycats/variations of these titles... This game is for you. This game is for you today, tomorrow and in 3 years. Do not wait. Buy. Do not thank ME, thank the developers and spread the word. 

That is all.

With Love & Regards,

Trading is not intuitive, you never sell how much you select (higher than a value you want to keep), the vendors sometimes don't buy at all the goods. To see what you sold and in what quantity you have to visit the budges tab. If the traveling vendors don't want to buy everything you have in stock then there should be a section in the trading UI to show the lowest and highest amount a trader is interested in buying. I could never make the traveling vendors buy plank or clothes for the love of anything holy.

Some of the emissaries and monk quests are bugged. Being in a hills map they keep asking for fish. Only way to get is to buy if someone is selling since you can't fish them out of the ground with ponds/running water missing in such a map. Sometimes when i had enough berries/bread i couldn't complete the quest since it wasn't in stockpile. I tried to stop the transporters from selling the items from granaries but they didn't listen. Apparently the buttons there don't work properly. 

The villagers wanting a certain thing and losing crazy amounts of happiness trying to figure what sector needs what. The biggest problem was churches. Had to build two really close to each other since some of my villagers were too lazy to walk to the other and i even put more space in that still didn't resolve the problem until i made a new one. At some points in my playthrough i had enough food but villagers were crying about food. I presume i had to make more markets across the regions (still don't know since it didn't quite resolve the problem). More information about this could be useful in the UI telling players that they need more production or more shops.

The military missions were a nice touch especially when the mission is a success awarding you with money and some giving you items(tools, stone, etc.), but they are a bit basic for my taste.

There are too few iron mining sections on the map ( only played hills 2 times, had 3 marble deposits like i needed that much  ) to keep a nice flow of the production line.

Warehouses only store up to 100 items per slot. That's kinda low imo.

The Good:
1. This game is an enjoyable medieval city builder. If you're into city builders, you'll likely enjoy this and feel at home watching your little minions run around.
2. Devs seem to care and release regular updates for their early access game, have no problem putting money into a fun game being made better!
3. Progression system that feels difficult but not impossible to run through. It's mainly based on population and population type which will unlock additional buildings and production.

The meh:
1. The UI makes me feel I'm using microsoft paint with one arm while riding a tricycle...not a fan
2. Population progression is largely based on individual villager needs - which can be a pain in the butt to actually identify. TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT TORRENCE.
3. Gold is easy to either make a lot of or end up like my gamestock shares...be careful

All in all, I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys sims or citybuilders. If that's not your type of game, I'd watch a few youtube videos and then decide. Keep up the good work devs!",1612407879,1612407879,True,9,0,0.636882364749908447,0,True,False,True

Starting off as a new player, I found it difficult to get into foundation. It is a good concept, and like so many other games out there that have stood on the same game structure, they have made small changes here and there to create something ""new"". As time has passed, the developers have really put time and effort into making this a much better game. They have wonderful, promising attributes, that have been released as “up and coming”. Currently in the state that the game is in, it has finally picked up a life of its own and is working towards making a name for itself. The game had and still has a lot of UI issues and bugs that are being worked out. The developers seem to have fixed most mapping issues now, and the pathing is not as bad as it was in the beginning, although it could use some more work, but I am sure they have heard that a lot. 
As far as the game currently stands, I would purchase it again. It has promise, and I am excited to be in on the ground floor as they are improving. If you like simulation games and you are thinking about buying this one. I would say go for it.

The game feels great without any sort of grid, you can indeed mesh buildings into each other but you don't really want to because of how well the game feels with it's city progression.  The game with it's ""landmark"" system made me actually focus on making a city that looked good.  Thinking about putting a keep, church, or manor on a hillside, or near the river was kind of an actual choice I had to make.  Once you get to the end game you can build and customize your own monuments for your landmarks.

Also, there was quite a few bugs such as; villagers getting stuck and being unable to remove them or banish them, villagers not wanting to build houses, etc.

I will edit my review after these are addressed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Edit: For Developer

In response to the developer answering, which is quite a nice sight to see. I understand that using a separate window is better than looking through each buildings, although notifying me the role of who left would be infinitely better.

As per the actual 'Bug' that I mentioned, perhaps not as in depth as I should have, occurred after I had fixed the housing issues as the two workers on my builder hut next to the coast was acting buggy and the villagers couldn't reach their house. I attempted to fix it by deleting both the builder hut and their homes and they got perpetually stuck where the builder hut was and couldn't move until they vanished about 1 hour later because their needs were not filled. This I am sure would be considered a bug, respectively.

As per the housing issues, I had built a church and market near a logging/mining area outside of my main village with ample space for residential development, yet still villagers at the lowest level whom just joined my village was unable to build houses for reasons I could not understand. Whether that one is a bug or not, I do not know.

Thank you for responding to my review and I hope my explanations can be a little clearer this time. :)",1610995372,1611862745,False,5,0,0.543128073215484619,2,True,False,True

The bad...
The UI could use some work, but the developers have indicated that they will be working on that soon. Also, if you dont have enough goods that people desire, such as food or clothing, you can enter a very slow death spiral where people leave the village, and after vacating you have fewer people working those industries to supply those goods and few people in the markets to sell those goods, which means more people leaving the village, etc.",1611791886,1611791886,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Really there just isn't enough production information given to the player for the player to make informed decisions, and expand without disaster. This leads to  the downfall of this game which is an unhappiness downward spiral that strikes your village  periodically from out growing your production. It is often impossible to know when this is going to happen until you are in the middle of a shortage and oftentimes when it happens its too late to stop it without scaling EVERYTHING back and really just not having fun for an hour while you scramble to keep your population from leaving. Shortages lead to unhappiness, which leads to villagers leaving. Which leads to more shortages. So here a few suggestions that I have come up with. I hope the developer see this, or if you are reading this review it might help you make a decision on your purchase. (if these issues were solved it would be an INSTANT recommendation by the way.) 
   
    >It is IMPERATIVE I  know a villagers job when they leave! When a villager leaves due to unhappiness their job is vacated. I have markets and production centers all across the map, and it is impossible to track down on my own. If I don't know who left, I don't know what job needs a new villager. This just compounds the problem because the shortage becomes more widespread so unhappiness becomes even more widespread, leaving to  more villagers leaving! This turns into a downward spiral of death
    
     >I really need a line graph telling me how much of each resource is being consumed and how much is being made. If I know where production is lacking I can expand the correct and expand resource production and prevent the downward spiral.
   
     >It would be nice to have a better explanation for why a villager is unfulfilled. Currently my village is in a downward spiral due to lack of clothing, which is surprising considering I have a clothing surplus and all my market stalls are full of clothes, and the market stalls have employees. Clearly there are villagers somewhere who are unable to buy clothes but i don't know who, why, and where. In the same vein I also have a housing crisis but I have tons of land available with high desirability so I don't know why homes aren't being built. I believe it's because of lack of wood, but because i didn't know which villagers left due to unhappiness so I was unaware that my wood production was lacking. 
   
    >A trade route view would be nice as well. I have a lot of resources and it's impossible to centralize all of them. There are bottlenecks to be found but I have no way of doing that.  Again, this just exacerbates the downward spiral. I have the resources, I just don't know where they are held up. Villagers can't access them, they get unhappy, and they leave. The downward spiral continues. 
   >The tutorial leaves a lot to be desired but the game is still in early access so that is understandable. The wiki also doesn't provide much information but that's not the developers fault per say. 
An expansion of trade with neighboring towns would be great. You can only buy and sell a select few products. Sometimes you can plug a shortage by buying from your neighbors but it seems what you need is never for sale. It also applies for your production as well. Oftentimes when you over produce nobody is buying, although this may be a balance choice by the developers 

   >That being said there are some GREAT things about this game that i love!
No grid. The village expands naturally, I don't have to worry about building roads, the Villagers just make foot paths based on high traffic areas. It really is fun to watch your villagers expand organically. I can place buildings on the roads  or off to the side, and the villagers will adjust automatically


  >Large buildings are modular. You can customize a building to look exactly as you want, increasing its height, and how many modules it has. You could make a grand church with 20 bell towers if you want, or a lord's manor with a towering grandhall. 


  >Villagers build their own houses. All you have to do is zone an area and make sure it has the basics. High value buildings increase the desirability surrounding them and you will see bigger more impressive houses closer to the city center and smaller modest homes as you reach the edge of town. Villagers will also connect their homes to the footpath network on their own.  
So that being said. If the developers give us a better UI this game would be an instant recommendation and definitely the best settlement/town builder around.

The base mechanics are really, really good- once you understand how it all works :) Development zones are awesome.

Some improvements I would like to see:

- some kind of scaling for Trade (could be tiered): at some point I need to sell / buy in the 100s and 1,000s, not in 10s any more - give me a shipyard with vessels I can build then send abroad for more / different (exotic!) goods
- overall, the late game feels pretty empty now
- a change in tier 2 (goods) variety- everything in that tier revolves around clothes, that's boring (whereas I still produce more luxuries than necessary)
- resource sinks for cosmetic improvements: what if I want to get rid of my 100s of glass to make windows in all homes?
- research facilities (mage tower, alchemy lab, whatever) to unlock blueprints?
- entertainment, please: music, theater, show animals, whatever... 

Minor stuff:
- would be good to display the ""wounded"" status (and maybe unit strength) when assigning soldiers
- the Tavern mechanics are unclear- took me a while to understand you needed at least one lounge to sell all that wine and beer - and I still don't have a clue what ""meals"" are for
- the money average daily balance is useless- not sure how the ""average"" is calculated but it does not give any indication on how I am doing
- a tiered(?) Manor extension for Treasury (""Safe"") with a lot more capacity to store coins (adding extension after extension to store coins is ugly)

Keep up the good work :)

I've played a lot of these city builder kinda games, a number of which have been in early access and a couple have been abandoned. Its a risk you take with ANY early access game (DayZ anyone?) but so far polymorph games have been fairly regular with updates and most important, regular with communication with the community.
Devs, if you read this. The most important thing you can do to prevent your early access game from dying. COMMUNICATION. Let us know what you're working on, let us beta test stuff and give feedback. We are here to be your QA team. USE US!!!!!

Onto the review. The game is still a work in progress, but in my opinion has one of the best base systems to improve and tweak on. I love the art style of the game, the way the building system works is probably my favorite design yet Gridless and quick. Buildings are modular with different parts that serve different functions. Allowing you to choose between a small church or a massive cathedral. A cozy town or sprawling trade empire. 

The weak points of this game for me are the UI and the current tech tree path. The resource/trading system in the game has one very distinct path you must follow (largely based around access to tools) and beyond that first hurdle it no longer becomes a concern. Different starting cultures (with different building styles?) and access to different resources and trade routes could vastly increase replay-ability.

The AI and how they manage resources could also use a second look. The cap on how much resources a warehouse/granary can hold is a problem late game, leading to a big city crowded with storage buildings and AI struggling to organize them all.

From what i could tell, but man honestly the roleplay or story parts are so bad i cry my eyes out almost, I went to the hills and just 2 of the Factions were named, king or peasant for an example.. Just why that is just a big no? And fish was not a resource in the hills i could get on my own in it. i guess the map naming something about a sea might have it but the fact is fish is a ground resource and among hills not a single river in a whole 'country' that is kinda sad in many ways.. If they upp the roleplay-ish story parts and add a river possiblilty.. And like actually add a random bunch of possible stories to say why the people fled from the old kingdom or if they did or not, or did these guys simple met after traveling and wanted to settle down building a village.. i mean its closer to a learn how to manage your own city/town in the past irl than a game currently.. And id like to see it grow as a game now, i mean it has foundations like it name and that is nice and all but story, roleplay/imagination of that is lacking on high level sadly. It would take me less than 2 days alone to like add 10x more possible story stuff worth to the game and some scripter/coder/programmer or whatever could just implement it and add some random oh old kingdom they fled, add in a like/dislike balance and make game more interesting honestly.

I did play a few practice towns to get a hang of it, then moved onto a real play though. I spent most of my time playing on just one city. With that, after about 80 hrs I was able to complete all the achievements and build to a point where there was no point in continuing. I've tried some Mods, and most are really cool, so i'm going to play with some of those to bring some new life into the game. There's some really cool stuff out there if you like to take the time to actually design a city. 

Only thing I have against this game is that the AI pathing can be a bit wonky. For example, if someone is feeling thirsty, sometimes they don't go to the nearest water source, and instead insist on going to one much further away. It can be the same with food, or other services as well. UI could also be improved, its not super user friendly and looks a bit dated. Lastly, this game could use a ground leveling tool. Building on hills or in depressions can clip work areas and entrances into the ground, and sometimes the AI gets stuck. It also just doesn't look good. 

Overall however, I do like this game and would recommend it - especially if its on sale. I hope to see continued development and new features, maps and buildings.

It is also difficult if not impossible to identify what your villagers need , what they might be lacking, and how to provide it. There are also too few options for players to decide on how to appease their villagers after they are promoted to serf. Rather than just needing basics, such as food, serfs need to be entertained, and the only way a player can do that is by building a great many churches.

Unique engine building, similar to your classic Age of Empires but less focus on building an army as fast as possible, much more relaxing to just focus on your village. There is a military element where you send your soldiers on missions. There's no conflict on your land that I can see. I was able to play for hours without any need for military, however the missions do give pretty good rewards.

I was impressed to see that modding is allowed already and we don't even have to go to the Steam Workshop. Mods can be browsed, installed, and enabled in the game menu. Super easy and a huge bonus!

The building placement is amazing. You can build extensions/rooms on existing buildings and customize it how you want. Most extensions will snap on to existing buildings regardless of terrain. 

Citizens build their own houses so you just designate what area you want for residential. Keep in mind the area must be of good quality (lots of decor) or your residents wont live there. Also, when you promote them their standards go up, so make sure to keep upgrading decor until your housing area becomes ""very high."" 

The concept of the market is very interesting. You designate what products to sell and your villagers will buy them. You can customize the market with various decor as well. 

For the most part, the villagers are smart enough to do their job. I have noticed sometimes they are standing around when they should be working (yes I understand they sometimes have ""free time""). 

Cons:

Trading seems bugged or just slow. It would be nice to send traders to pick up supplies rather than wait for one to arrive at your village. 

I know it's alpha, but there should be some kind of endgame goals. Once you reach 100+ villagers and build everything, it's pretty much done. Keep expanding if you want, but I think I'll wait for more content.


For early access, I am impressed. But there are some bugs to work out and trading/housing need some work. I am looking forward to a new UI redesign as well. It sounds like the devs stay involved. Let's hope they listen to the players and it's not a cash grab game. Looking forward to seeing where this game is in 1 year.",1609445845,1609549637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Unlike most city builders, any specialty monuments that you build are hand crafted entirely by you. There are no prefabs. You place how every many pieces you want in however many ways you like to create anywhere from the tiniest of buildings to the largest of colossal structures. It is entirely up to you on how you want to create it. The only limitations are the selection of items you get to place.

Cities in this game will arguable look more organic then in any other city builder with little to no effort. This is because villagers build their own houses and living quarters within the zones that you designate. As well as all the paths and roads in the game are formed by the villagers as they travel from one location to the next. You will never build a house and you will never place a road. All that work is done for you. It creates wonderfully unique cities and villages as the villagers put them together on their own with only a little bit of assistance from yourself.

When it comes to the production of resources, that is where the game falls back into your hand. It is up to you to place work structures such as farms, blacksmiths, storage facilities, wood cutters, and many many more. You then assign jobs and and the workers take over the rest. When a villager goes to choose a location for its house, it will look for something already built that is close, or if possible build its own house near by its work so that it doesn't have to travel as far. It is a really neat mechanic.

When a new villager joins your town, things start out very simple as they they will only require a single food resource to survive and be happy. As time goes on you will have opportunities to promote villagers from newcomer, to Serf, to Commoner, and then to finally Citizen (as the game continues in development, other citizen levels may be added). And with each of these new citizenship levels comes new requirements. Newcomers only require 1 food source, Serfs require a food source and faith which is provided from spending time in a church, Commoners require 2 food sources, faith, upgraded living that they will construct themselves and now clothes as well (no longer will they have to be naked (sub sub comment: villagers arent actually naked up until this point)), and then the rank of Citizen requires 2 food sources, faith, clothes, lvl 2 housing, and now Luxury goods too.

So your probably asking yourself, ""why even upgrade the villagers to higher ranks if it means they need more stuff to take care of them when every rank can do any kind of job and the higher the rank you get the more limitations there are on jobs that you can do. Also it costs me money to upgrade them.""

Which is a valid point. You definitely don't want to upgrade everyone and you want at the very minimum more serfs then commoners, and more commoners then citizens. But villagers collect these resources by ""purchasing"" them from markets that you build up and place around the town. Purchasing is in quotes because villagers don't technically have any money of they own. Its just that when an item is collected from a market, you make money and that is your main source of income in the game. And different items grant different amounts of money and higher teir items like clothes and even luxury goods net you the most money. So if you have the resource chains set up and ample enough resources, its better to upgrade villagers that you can so that they can ""purchase"" more items from the markets and you can make more money to afford more structures as well as afford to maintaining the structures you have already built.

The developers did a fantastic job at implementing many of these features and have many more exciting things coming in the future.

A few issues that come up over time is if a worker already has a home but you change its job, normally it doesn't move to a new house. So you have to go into the house and kick it out so it will find a closer place to live. Otherwise villagers will walk the entire distance of the city just to get to work. So by the time the villager gets to work, its needs require to be filled and it will leave work to go and replenish itself. The other thing that isnt so much of an issue but something I would like to see is more cosmetic items that I can build and place around the village. Designing how everything looks is important for me and one of my favorite parts of this game in particular.

If your still interested in the game and want to see more first before deciding, I made a review for the game that goes into a few other things I didn't write about in here. https://youtu.be/CMvBcD9dnGk

The organic structure of housing, roads and expansion is very well done in Foundation.  The challenge, however, is that once you move past a simple cluster of buildings and expand outward into populations of 100+, the issues become far more glaring.  My most recent playthrough reached a population of 700 and it wasn't tenable due to the incredibly poor UI that gives next to no information, more specifically:
- There is very little information about any supply chains, particularly around reach, stock in different warehouses/sectors beyond a total tally of what's in stock at a given time
- Trading is clunky and there is no easy visibility of what is currently sellable and buyable except if you scour through the neighbour screen, which says nothing about buying/selling volumes
- Military challenges give decent rewards, but you have to manually requip your soldiers with swords and click on them one by one for every single military campaign
- The quests/challenges are so flat that it's easy to just ignore them - get berries, fish, bread, planks or wood with tragically little variation
- Drilling down into citizens is clunky because you either use a citizen view which gives you a flat list of them, or you have to manually follow them around, which is not worth the effort at high population counts

The game has massive potential, but the absolutely minimal UI greatly pulls down any enjoyment factor for anyone that enjoys civ/sim-style games.",1609402625,1609402625,False,25,0,0.737610816955566406,0,True,False,True

At the beginning the game has some quests to guide you through the initial buildup, but as soon as you complete them you are going to be completely lost. There are no actual ""goals"" you need to achieve in the game, nor rivals you need to drive out of the game.

The rest of the game is just a recursion of earning money, promoting your settlers, expanding your territories. It gets boring real quick. 

The map is somewhat too big. For minerals -considering you need housing in the proximity of workplaces, it's very tough to get those resources quickly. For the gameplay - it seems that most of the map is meaningless as you already get to experience 80% of the game mechanics with a 10-tile empire.

And as mentioned in other comments there's a lack of collective management tools - you can't see the expenditures, demands, productions under one single panel. So when some resources dip quickly you are bound to overreact and ramp up the production too much.

really relaxing.

Graphics are extremely smooth, game play continues to improve and has been stable since I originally purchased, and the path/goal is easily identified and fun to work towards. Overall, it's a great time sink that you can spend hours on having fun.

Specific positives:
You dictate how everything looks. Want your rustic church to be spartan and simplistic? Make it so. Want it to be tiered with different court yards that flow into the village sprouting up around it? Make it happen. The customization to the bigger structures is pretty awesome and can lead to a lot of different combinations.

The citizens, while extremely picky and slow to catch up to even their own desires that they can fulfill, are truly a fun thing to watch. Unlike most city builders, the citizens of this one dictate how things grow from their standpoint. They carve the paths that make the most sense to them. You can place buildings to try and manipulate those paths, but they pick and choose. Same with their housing, they pick where they want to erect their domiciles. Which is the one complaint I have about that system: I'll carve out a giant area for them to build homes, but they will not plop a new one for them until they're so upset they're ready to leave. It's rather infuriating.

I have 1000s of hours on Banished, Anno, C:S, Civ, etc so this is exactly the type of game that interests me. Unfortunately there are just too many massive problems with the game for me to recommend it.  

- The systems are poorly balanced. They alternate between boring and severe with no real middle ground management.
- The UI is horrible. In addition to being ugly and hard to read, it is very bad at providing critical information. For example, there is no way to monitor trends in your resource chains, which is basically a must have for this type of game.
- There are no interesting goals in the game, just endless 'put x amount of resource in your warehouse'. The military management is a nice idea but it doesn't actually do anything.
- The core upgrade/unlock estate system is somehow both unintuitive and incredibly shallow. It amounts to spamming to unlock higher versions of things.
- The citizen management (I do not say this lightly) is the absolute WORST I have every played in this type of game. It is a nightmare to keep track of what people need as there is basically no information whatsoever about this other than randomly clicking on people. 

It's a shame because some elements of the game such as customizing buildings and organic house growth are really refreshing for this genre and work very well. I hope some core issues are addressed - however, the fact that this game has been in EA for a LONG time and still has such glaring issues is not a promising sign.

Foundation is pretty much a Bonsai Town. You mostly grow it to relax during the process. You can get into micromanagement but it still is not too frustrating or too hard. You quickly get a hold of everything and the longer you play the better you get managing your people and your resources.
Right now there is nothing seriously challenging about it. There are only two ""outside"" factors that give you something to worry about. Except not really.

If I have to say something negative, it would be that you might lose interest in your town after several hours. That is because there is technically no end to a round or no goal you can achieve. At some point you just start doing the same thing over and over and over just for the sake of growing the population of Zen town.
But that is nothing I worry about. The game is still in early access and it is doing a much better job than a lot of other EA games.
Plus, if your current town actually starts to annoy you. Just start a new one. Even if it still technically would be doing ""the same thing over and over again"", its always is kind of exhilarating. Because you can apply what you learned from the last one and start from scratch. Maybe even with new content.

Medieval setting colony management sim with some economy and resource management.  What sets Foundation apart from a lot of the city-builders with historical themes is a vibrant, cheery visual experience.  The simulated people in the game you usually never see because you're zoomed out, but the landscapes - the way the grass and trees are rendered, the mountains and bodies of water - are so beautifully rendered alongside the little villages and hamlets you make.

Another really fun and compelling twist is that the placement of residential buildings and roads are not directly controllable by the player.  You place resource producing/processing buildings, and then paint ""zones"" in which residential buildings are allowed.  They spring up on their own, and the roads are just the paths the simulated people took to get from one place to another more or less directly.  This ""painting a zone thing"" also extends to painting areas where tree cutting, hunting, etc are allowed.  While it might seem on the surface that removing road-building makes the game easier; it just shifts the focus to other aspects of the game-play, the zone painting feature being a clever way to offload the minutia of management simulation.  I think this gives your eyeballs more time to take in and appreciate the look of the game and the bigger picture, as the small starting hamlet becomes several interconnected villages.

The game's visual and audio style is highly polished and appealing and the experience of playing it is relaxing, even when things are going wrong.  The simulated people don't ""die"" in this game when their needs aren't met, they just move away.  Another interesting choice is that the simulated people don't reproduce as they do in other games.  The size of your population grows depending on how much space you have for people to build on, and how happy the people there are.  The economic/resource challenge is to avoid the death spiral of low satisfaction and no one coming in to work in the buildings you need staffed.  At about three stages, the production chains are fairly simple, logical, and easy to remember, with only a small number of products requiring 1-2 additional production steps.

THE GOOD STUFF
1) It's pretty.  The landscape is gentle, a little on the animated side in style.  Once your city starts growing, it is fun to drop down very low to the ground and look at.  The people look like penguins, true, but cute penguins.  The buildings are interesting and well modeled.  Overall, nicely done visuals in art style and engine.

2) Perfect involvement balance.  Some city-builders demand incessant and deeply annoying micromanagement to avoid depopulation and no funds to fix anything.  Foundation isn't like that.  Yes, there is very definitely a learning curve (see the Bad).  But once you know what you're doing, the logistics for the most part get out of the way and you can enjoy building, zoning, and watching your city grow.

3) Casual.  For me, who feels like he's stolen something if he gets 20 hrs a month into a game, this is a nice drop-in-and-play game.  It's got enough to keep you expanding (mining in particular), but not so much that it demands an intense crunch-time of playing.  Then again...

THE BAD
1) It's too casual.  While the game is nice as a casual, it's got nothing that will drive real engagement after about 15 hours of playtime.  I had the tech tree plumbed to its depths, built walls and keeps... and then realised that military was pure decoration.  No enemies, no tradeoff between expansion and security, no reason at all to build anything related to defence or offence.

2) Very steep initial learning curve.

To me this game has been worth the $$.

A Lovely idea a organic Sim City Builder IMO executed well, its organic in the sense that roads are formed where villagers choose to travel not where the player chooses to build them, however fear not you get to set zones to guide where your Villagers are allowed to go, they prefer traveling on roads however should a road not be traveled for a while nature will retake it this can be useful when the need arises to fix a section of road that is in the way of your vision first restrict the area wait till villagers from a detour road and the old road over grows then reset the zone. Housing is also a natural process where the player can set Residential zones but villagers choose where to build their homes within these zone. However these are only chosen if the villager needs can be full filled, their requirements in turn are based on their status. Status can be upgraded once a month as long as a great hall exists, each new class demands new things Serfs require basic housing 1 food item and access to church services higher levels require access to more complex goods. The Economy is tied into the needs system as food clothing and luxury items are sold through markets which generate your main source of income. A real nice addition is ability to build Custom Monuments via a modular building system. Monuments in game is a concept that is any more complex structure including Taverns, Military Keeps, Churches, and Lord Manor houses allowing the player to make anything from a humble Manor house to a Magnificent Manorial Complex.

Some things are not super clear (like equipping your soldiers with weapons manually) but the process of advancing makes more sense. 

This game is great, even if it's unfinished.

What I like about it:
- 'monument' buildings are customizable and variable, giving you creative control over some aspects of the game
- the graphics are adorable
- you can follow villagers, see why they're unhappy, and reassign them to jobs if needed
- despite an intro guide on the game, most of the game is intuitive if you've played city builders before
- zones are a neat idea and allow you to change and update your village as needed

What I don't like much:
- much is left unexplained, like quests. I failed a quest because I didn't hit a checkmark.
- when your city gets large, the framerate slows down significantly
- while monuments are adjustable, they're not well explained and advancing to higher tier buildings can be challenging
- trade routes are static, and rarely very beneficial 

what I'd like to see:
- I'd like to see the envoy from [CITY NAME] have a city
- more guidance on early game advancements; the king gives you missions to complete some buildings to advance your progress but they are very sparse

what entertained me:
- my current city is so large the game can no longer generate names so I have about 60 people named something like Woman #1696 and Man #172

Total change of mind.
Peaceful ambience, just set your villagers up and watch them succeed once you give them proper guidance. I feel lowkey productive even though it's just a video game which is really nice. Sure it's a wild time sink, even on 3x speed, but it's got a background feel to it. Like I'll just start it up, get myself to a good point, then wander around my room doing things pretending I'm also playing a video game. Makes doing chores easier tbh. I really hope they don't make it a game I have to pay attention to in the future. I really enjoy the laid back nature and lack of conflict currently. It's like if stardew valley was an rts.

I've done a total one eighty on it, but you need to know a few things:

1-Time sink. It takes hours to play, but you will notice progression frequently enough that you feel like you're accomplishing things.
2-Sharp learning curve, not all information is available, obvious, or clearly communicated in-game (for example, more territory you buy=less cashflow because you pay taxes on your land. This is not clearly explained.)

The game isn't super deep yet. You'll get to a point fairly quickly where there is no more vertical progression to do. However, you can still horizontally progress to grow you population without collapsing. There is tons of land in the maps to build on.

The thing that really makes this game special is the dynamic pathing. You don't need to draw roads. In fact, you kinda can't draw roads (I say ""kinda"" because you -can- use techniques to guide people to path certain ways). 
You'll need to utilize some tricks to make the paths go where you want them, but there are native tools and techniques in-game to do it. 

I have spent hundreds of hours in city builders. Cities Skylines, Tropico, Anno, Sim City, etc. Any time I think about going back to play one of those, I just can't do it. I don't really want to draw roads anymore after playing this game.  I love being able to drop buildings where ever I want, and let the people figure out how to get there. You can cram things together to make a tight community, or spread it out and have tiny little hamlets across the map.

The problem I've run into is in the later game food production lines tank even though I've been almost exclusively building food production.  I have a difficult time understanding what the supply vs demand is, and what the effect of building another production building provides.  I think including charts or more information would help alleviate this.

Keep in mind that this review only considers the game up to the current state at the time of this review (Alpha  1.6; Minerals & Craftmanship). Also, i will include some ideas of my own into the end of this review that could enhance this game in the future.

This game has been recommended to me by a friend with the words ""Yo, you play a lot of Cities: Skylines, so this game might be something for you"". And it definitely was a lucky grab.

Foundation plays and feels less like Citites, save for the zoning tool, and more like the old Settlers and Anno games (back when they were good), which clearly served as an inspiration for this game. The premise is really simple: Start your own town as some kind of Count, expand, build stuff, expand more, rinse and repeat. Here are some Pros and cons of this game:

Pros:
+ UI is mostly pretty clear and easy to access, showing you all the necessary stats that you need, like monitoring earnings and spending, your Army etc.
+ The game is really well optimized. Even in the current state of my town (over 500 lost souls), the amount of admittedly highly detailed buildings in the highest settings and with the rainfall modified i never experienced a single frame drop or graphical issue within the game.
+ Building is fairly easy, especially modular buildings which can be either free-formed or snapped onto each other as long as you consider the funky dots next to each module. Other buildings give the game a more dynamic feel due to their free placement to your heart's content.
+ Base mechanics are very easy to learn while more ""advanced"" mechanics or strategies are still inside the game, which makes for a simple, yet decently rewarding learning curve.
+ You can promote citizens, which require more ressources, but also produce more ressources, depending on their occupation, which requires better planning in terms of supply chains and housing and has its own learning curve.
+ Expansion is fairly straight forward and easy to understand.
+ Some slight events like Envoys, certain hidden requirements and weather changes keep the game a bit interesting.

But not everything is happy and rosy. Here are my cons i encountered during my hours.

Cons:
- There is no real Endgame, which really takes off the steam from the game once you unlocked everything via the unlockable menu. One can consider the Monastery as the ""Endgame"", and the amount of expensive ressources you can produce with it makes obtaining money relatively easy.
- Trading in this game is really barebone and seems a bit random on what you sell. You also can't sell every ressource you obtain, which leads to extensive stacks of worthless ressources. The amount of trade routes is also a bit lacking, since you can't set up any on your own.
- The Military, as neat as it sounds on paper, is currently just a powerful economic factor and can only be sent out to campaigns in the current state. There are no outside threats that require fortifications or an extensive Army either, which makes the game too easy in non-raintimes.
- Housing can't be freely placed or upgraded, however they spawn randomly within a designated housing zone, which can lead to some pathfinding issues for the villagers.
- Some masterpieces have way too powerful and undesireable effects that don't make their asking price worth their abilities. One masterpiece is also totally abundant in the current state, so the message ""Effect: Not implemented yet"" shouldn't be even shown. To name the Culprits: The Knight Statue Masterpiece effectively crashes your economy, and the Giant Gate Masterpiece currently has no effect whatsoever.
- There is only one random ""Nerfing"" event that you need to manage around, which makes preparing and ""surviving"" through it very easy.
- In late stages of the game your city will be plastered with the same production buildings to fullfill the ressource needs of your town, which makes it look really monotone in some quarters. You can not upgrade those buildings either, so spamming those is the easiest way to get your economy running.
- The game in the ""Endgame"" stage is too easy.

Those were the big pros and cons of this game that i noticed during the gametime. It's easy for beginners, but too easy for more experienced or well-equipped Counts, and at one point it can get pretty boring sometimes. Regardless, i'd recommend the game for people who like city builders, and this game is a rather dynamic one in that regard.

I teased that i'll propose some ideas to enhance this game even further. I don't know if the developers are even reading those reviews or already planned to implement said features, however i can still give it a shot.
1) The military sector could use a bit more depth. Outside threats like bandits or enemy forces would make fortifications even more desireable and give insentive to expand your Army. A variety of weapons or armours could add different roles to your soldiers (currently they're only foot soldiers equipped with either a sword or a spear; armor color is based on their Rank). Maybe the implementation of even higher ranking soldiers (Generals chosen from high-level knights for example) would give more tactics and efficiency, spicing up the game up even more.
2) The addition of guilds for certain jobs would be a logical step in this game. Requiring ressources themselves and would cost some money, they could make production of said jobs more efficient.
3) Expansion of already existing buildings, especially Warehouses and Granaries, would be a great way to clutter your map with less buildings fullfilling the same role. Expansions would cost more money and require more workers to properly operate them, however they could produce a bit or store a bit more ressources.
4) More weather effects that affect certain things within your small town. The current weather event, Heavy Rainfall, is fairly easy to manage, so more difficult to manage events would give the game a bit more things to manage. Snow for example could lead to less production of items because villagers move slower or stay more often in their houses (if they have any) for example, A drought for example could lead to a lower berry, grapes and fish yield and thirstier villagers, but could lead to more grain yield. Although, some ideas would require more complex buildings.
5) More buildings to unlock that could be more desireable and either prolong the ""Endgame"" or could lead to a totally different ""Endgame"" or produce more diverse ressources.
6) Maybe a desireable and motivational Ranking Up system for the player himself. Starting as a Lord, you can promote yourself to higher statuses like Baron, Count, Duke and maybe later proclaim your own Kingdom as a King, given the player met certain requirements. This could lead to more buildings for the Royalty and offer unique challenges itself.
7) And for the screenshot cracks: A photo-mode would really help to shine out the beauty of this game even more.

This was my totally short review of Foundation. A great game with a lot of things that it currently does right, but some things it still misses out. For the current price it's a fair deal and if you enjoy games in this genre, i can fully recommend to give it a try.",1606835144,1606835144,True,83,0,0.872406959533691406,0,True,False,True

If there was anything I could change, I'd like to have the possibility to change the width/general shape of buildings as well as the height. I guess this would be difficult for the graphics, but right now I feel like I have to build some extremely high or generally Frankenstein-esque churches to get enough capacity (and splendour in the early game). I've seen screenshots of some beautiful creations though, so maybe it's just a matter of more practice. I'm also not sure about the order in which churches of certain types become available in the game (I'd generally think Romanesque churches came before the more Gothic-like churches that are available before them in this game? Similarly wooden/""legacy"" church-types seems to make more sense as predecessors to the ""normal"" (rustic) church type in this game than vice versa). Sometimes I also miss the clear resource chains of older city builder games (i.e. if you build 2 of these for every 1 on these, you will get the exact amount of resource x necessary to sustain a population of y), but I guess the dynamic nature of this game is also one of it's selling points, and it makes sense that travel time etc. have a significant impact on resource chains. These are minor annoyances, though!

In general, I love the game. I keep playing again and again, even knowing I'm working with the exact same map as a previous playthrough, with very little difference. It's just so addictive!  I don't know whether it's the cute graphics or the relaxed pace or something else, but this game is very relaxing.

Main downside is that there is not much to do at the moment.
You spawn some buildings, and then watch the ""ant farm"".
After a while a tiny village is overrun by new settlers, and you are forced to increase food production, which will only delay the inevitable starvation.

There are some bugs too - like building tires are unlocked, but no building present in build menu.
As of 1.6 - you can overlay structures in castle buildings, progress slowed down.

I know Banished is the Benchmark, an in my opinion, it is as good as the unmodded Banished even now.

The Maps are big enough to get 1000 townsfolk and its pretty easy once you get into the expanding your resources as your town grows, just like Banished, if you neglect to expand, then the demands of the people cannot be met, although they dont die, they leave and no-one else joins.

No breeding of people yet, no schooling, no idea if the yield increases as the people level up.

War is also pretty simple and gets you lots of money, you just wait until your liklihood to win is is extreem and then it fills your bank up but its Early Access and lots more to come.

I recommend this, you will not be disappointed for the price and the early access is bug free and feature rich, modding is already taking off so you can see that as long as they keep updating the base game with features like human life cycle, illness, more crops, improved military (raids) and improved trading, all the things on the timeline, it will be a great game, perhaps the best in its genre.",1605859075,1605859075,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Even when keeping your villagers need well met, it takes a long time to gain new ones and so you often find yourself waiting around before you can add more buildings and grow the city. Defences and walls are purely aesthetic, and the trading system is either broken, or simply poorly utilised and explained. For a game that has been in early access for nearly two years I would have expected much more. 

Having said all that, I did find it fun to play while it lasted. The graphics although VERY basic are pretty. I like the way that it moves away from grid based city builders in a way that is very organic and fun. I'm the kind of person that swears by grids and filling up every little square, and I found this was done in a way that satisfied me well.

Resource management is the driving force of the game. And yet the ways in which the resources are distributed from their origin throughout the town are convoluted and unexplained. The trade system is also confusing and poorly explained. After hours of playing, I still don't know what all of the resource and trade checkboxes in every menu actually do when I toggle them.

I dislike that if I destroy a resource camp all of the material within it disappear. There should be a way to command that the resources be removed from the camp. I also learned the hard way that if you change which resource is stored in a warehouse, the current inventory is destroyed. The military system is relatively pointless. The envoys and monks are also pointless by midgame. I also have issues with villagers walking past multiple available markets and wells to stand in the city center with their needs unfulfilled until it time for them to return to work.

Graphics are really nice, but they really could implement day / night cycle and do a bit more on weather effects.

Music is nice and while I fully agree that in this type of game does not need agreesive music and more relaxing, it still is a bit tooooo slow for my taste and could be a bit more improved,

Game does have really big micromanagment system and you will not have just wood / stone / water resources. I did not fully counted but there is at least 10 but still you have 4-5 essentials others are for stuff like tents in different colours.

If you're new to the townbuilder/citybuilder genre, then this might still be ok to pick up.

What the game lacks in UI user friendliness, it makes up for with it's art style and modding.

Foundation is a Townbuilder game set in the middle ages. You control the enigmatic Lord of your town (who curiously never actually shows up in person) in an attempt to grow a town into a city into a dominating state. 

You're given the task of meeting the needs and demands of the people and that's essentially it for the start. As you progress, you can ""upgrade"" your citizens into more complex people who have new demands and needs. Balancing happiness, income, and costs is your main gameplay loop. Built a new building? It has upkeep. Got new land? Taxes. You need to constantly be finding ways to increase income ahead of increasing your costs in order to not run bankrupcy and risk your population growing unhappy and leaving. 

Luckily, the game has a brilliant way of handling this. Your people arrive as (lvl 1 crooks) Newcomers, who only need food and basic needs to be happy. As you ""promote them"" (newcomer to serf) they gain additional needs like housing and church services. (Lvl 10 thug) etc etc.

I'm really excited to see where this game is heading.
My biggest criticisms are that...
-The UI userability is low (not a dealbreaker)
-Pathfinding can be really wonky sometimes and it's not unusual to get citizens stuck or unable to continue their pathing. (While not dealbreaking, it really does require a bit more work)
-There needs to be more items in the base game, and as such they should be better organized.
-It's pretty easy to ""soft lock"" yourself out of things in the early game by using up your stores of cloth.
-What if I don't *want* to build a church, huh?

Edit: After playing a few more hours and reaching the ""end game"" I can tell that this game indeed falls into the trappings of similar games as micromanagement never goes away, and there are no new tools to aid in dealing with the bigger picture issues.

Having the villagers create their own paths as they walk so I don't have to try to fit buildings around the arc of a street is such a great way to design.

It's ridiculously easy to succeed, and once it's fully developed there might be a challenge mode that encourages you to crank up the speed and try to meet some overbearing overlord's quotas for polished stone or soldiers or whatnot, but for now, it's a great little software toy with its own moments of achievement.

As an example:
I built my village center on the side of a hill, with farmland in the valley bottom and a little church on the next gentle rise. It looked like a nice spot for a house, so I added a small residential zone next to the church and was just rewarded by the villagers deciding to put a house on the spot after about two months game time.

For your early investment, you'll easily get a dozen hours or so of village building. It takes a while to get the hang of the production chains and even with a restart or two you'll be rapidly expanding in no time.

Some of the buildings bug out when they are being built. Builders will refuse to deliver a particular item to a building and the only option is to delete the building or part of a modular build and place it down again. This usually solves it and is a minor inconvenience at most.

I do recommend it to support the development.

However! There are some issues with the un-modded game. Currently my cities max out at around 200-250 settlers as the happiness levels are very unstable, housing is difficult and keeping on top of supplies is um-manageable at times. 
As an example you need new villagers to expand your city but they don't come if the happiness level is below a really high bar (like in the 90%'s) villagers continue to not build housing even when very desireable areas are available to build housing, also providing for your population is confusing, I currently have many many resources and infrastructure but still end up lacking to offer food/clothing/etc which is confusing even when building a very conservative city.
This ultimately creates a cycle of unhappiness and makes it really hard to build a late stage city with all the nice things.
Lastly, some of the maps just disappear at map boundaries which kinda ruins the beauty of some of the maps.

It is a very fun and interesting game. Very similar to Banished but with more organic growth.

I hope the modding community goes nuts and adds lots of new buildings and resources like it did with Banished. It is a bit shallow at the moment, but still in early access, so that is to be expected a bit.

Soldiers and military missions are a cool different way to gain resources. The  different levels of the Kingdom, Church and People is fun to work through an unlock things.

The Keybindings seem to be locked and use rotation methods that are different than I am what I have set for other similar games, which is VERY confusing. Also rotating a building is very clunky and uses controls that I feel could be changed to something else like a simple key press as opposed to holding down Ctrl and using the mouse movement. Even the scroll wheel would be better. I also want to change scrolling and rotation speed but there doesn't seem to be a way to do this.

I have begun to play the game more and it seems like it is very fun but it really needs some work in the ergenomics and UI. It can be very confusing to figure out how to do things like promoting your pops. You can only do it at the begining of the month and if you don't find the button in time to do it you have to wait another month apparently. I couldn't figure it out for almost two months as I assumed it was somewhere on the manor menu since that was part of that specific quest. Also more information about trade would be great. I can never figure out if trading is happening and how much is being sold. I see trade income but I still have tuns of resources ever though I have set them to be traded away. I assume there a carry limit but still more control or more info over trading would be useful. Another thing that would be super useful is better hotkeys. I would like to get to a the build menu by hitting b or see my villagers by hitting v or p for pops. This goes back to the customizable key bindings though. 

The general aspect of the game is very enticing but figuring out how to do things and where to go to do them is very complicated. It not about what strategy that is difficult but just figuring out where to go to do the thing you know you need to do which i think is due more to poor design UI than difficulty. For instance why does only 10 people show up when trying to give someone a job. Luckily there is an option to select only unemployed but it took me almost 5 minutes to figure this out. One citizen kept going to the wrong storage and it took me way longer than it should to figure out how to get them employees in the right place. Churches also need better feedback as I have half my population saying they aren't receiving their service and yet the church is almost always empty. I believe the issue is due to a radius effect that buildings can only work in. I noticed this first with the Forseter since you can see his radius pretty obviously. Problem is the game doesn't show this or talk about it anywhere so again poor UI design hiding game mechanics necessary to properly plan your city. I feel like most my citizens are wasting time doing nothing since they are out of range but can't no for sure since there is rarely any comment about it. For instance I had hunters doing nothing forever with no clue because i didn't know i needed to set up hunting areas. Why isn't this under alerts. If any citizen isn't working there should be an alert, not just the forester.

Foundation is an extrevigant calculator (computer) game, because of it's originality
and it's bright future. I, lord Amdo, have overseen but a few settlements with peoples'

The actual points:
I personaly realy enjoy the monument buildings,
with which I can express my full creativity.
It is also a great pleasure to have a part of the process
being done by the people themselfs and the fact that
you can also partialy restrict/help/guide them,
but not having full controll (it can be frustrating,
but that's part of the fun in my opinion).

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: This review is/was written when this game was in/is still in Early Access. Think twice before buying/playing this game [/quote]

Foundation is a game developed and published by Polymorph Games

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Foundation overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a good city builder simulation game and to play in short bursts but still needs a lot of work...

However there are some issues I'd like to see addressed by the developers in order to really recommend it at it's current price point:

- The promotion system needs work. Very annoying if you're playing at 3x speed to have a window of about 2 seconds where you have to be actively watching the calendar with your mouse hovered, ready to pause the game in order to promote your villagers. You should just be able to access the promotion window whenever you want once you unlock it. Needlessly annoying and easy to fix quality of life change.

- No option to clear resources from the map that you don't need for the Aesthetiiiic. Reeee!

- Villagers need too much church. Really need to look at scaling back the villagers requirements in regards to faith. Their other needs are fairly well balanced.

- The workplace menu is either buggy or doesn't update often/quickly enough. Issues such as showing 1 villager working in two different places at the same time or showing 12 villagers working at different jobs when you only have 10 villagers.

- A lot of aspects of the game aren't particularly intuitive or explained well in the tooltips, could do with much more comprehensive building descriptions and help menus.

Of course this is to be expected with a game that is still in early access. I think it can be a really good game if  some of these issues are addressed as it continues in its development.",1602825543,1602825543,True,4,0,0.553906142711639404,0,True,False,True

Complaints: 
Mechanics are often poorly-explained, even in tutorials. Some of the labels/tooltips make little to no sense. Learning curve is mostly trial-and-error, but the lack of a tight feedback circle (as is present in Banished, with its charts and graphs) makes this very hard. It's difficult to even tell what's upsetting your villagers most of the time. 

You have virtually no choice on building selection - you MUST build exactly what your people need at the right time in order to keep them happy. You're also pretty restricted in terms of building placement, since some buildings decrease housing quality and others increase it. The only efficient solution is to group ""Positive"" buildings in the center of the hex and ""negative"" buildings around the rim, then allow people to build houses in the center of the hex. 

You also must assign your villagers very precisely, and keep a very close eye on your production chains all the time. It's very frequent that a small mistake will break your supply chains and send you into a spiral of unhappiness that's difficult to recover from - more villagers will leave, breaking  your supply chains, and you're screwed. 

You don't have much info to make your decisions - the 'budget' screen is awful, you can't see production trends, there's not many ways to identify problems before they occur without a ton of repeated, manual checks. 

Speaking of which, doing anything efficiently is difficult. Villagers can be assigned to workplaces with a menu, but can't be unassigned, and villagers need to work the same job to keep leveling their skills. Research and trade systems both suck, with research really just being a question of how much you ""promote"" your villagers more than anything else, and trade just being an impenetrable mess that sorta works, but usually leaves me with massive stock overflows that I can't sell for some reason. 

In sum, although it seems deceptively simple and peaceful at first, it rapidly turns into a pretty brutal resource management sim, mostly due to its clunky systems. Unlike competing games (Banished is the closest that comes to mind), it lacks the polish and balance to make it fun to play in its current state. 


Positives: 
Large building variety - one of the big drawbacks of Banished, which had very deep gameplay but very limited building/advancement potential. Buildings are modular, so you can customize them to your needs. 

Developers seem pretty active, and there's a mod community. 

I have high hopes for this game, but I'll revisit it in six months when it's (hopefully) less frustrating and more rewarding.",1602730063,1602730063,False,97,3,0.774342536926269531,0,True,False,True

*EDITED FOLLOWING DEVELOPER RESPONSE*
(I now have about 50 hours into the game - edits are all in parantheses)

With ten hours in on two separate maps, I ran into the following issues:

-Vital resources suddenly no longer moving from the warehouse to the marketplace stall. Warehouse was fully staffed, resources simply stopped moving into and out of it. Building another warehouse and destroying the original rectified the problem. (This issue was due to having blocked in one of the entrances with another building)

-Happiness being wrecked by a totally unexplained symbol, no help from the in-game guide and no help from the wiki or google. It wasn't the housing symbol, but similar. Using a symbol without ever explaining what the symbol means is garbage design. Cool, my villagers are lacking something and I have -no way- of knowing what. (This was, as the developer pointed out, level 2 housing. UI overhaul will presumably rectify this)

-20 times in a row, with happiness between 85 and 96 each time, 0% success rate attracting immigration. This happened in my second game, and completely broke it - no immigration, game is broken. (It appears that this was due to insufficient level 2 housing - I would suggest to the devs adding a warning to the tooltip when hovering over the immigration panel if immigration chance is actually at 0% despite showing relatively high happiness)

-In both games, as soon as the rainy season started, performance crapped out. Mouse lag rendered the game almost unplayable, and after a time, entirely unplayable (we're talking a second or two between mouse movement and cursor response). The game isn't very demanding and my system has no difficulty playing it on maxed settings, usually getting 30-60fps; something weird is happening with the rainy season, and I'm not sure what. (I'm using a wireless mouse, and I'm pretty sure this had nothing to do with the game, but was my mouse crapping out. Replacing the batteries has eliminated this issue)

-My soldiers endlessly attacked their training dummies, and their experience never moved one iota. (This was because the soldiers were never armed. Some kind of dialog would be nice to inform players that each soldier must be manually given a sword. I did eventually figure it out, with help from Google)

I was enjoying playing, and there's a lot to the game. I hope it improves in the future. Paying half the price of a major studio release for a game that doesn't function well enough to actually play is very frustrating. I understand this is an early release, and expect there to be bugs - the game as it is does not merit a $30 price tag, and I feel ripped off.",1602062683,1602566715,False,2,0,0.462616831064224243,0,True,False,True

A couple of things I wish in the game:

- A more new user-friendly 'tutorial' at the beginning of the game that lets you experience the tutorial rather than read it from the in-game manual. Perhaps a paused-game tutorial every time we build new buildings or upgrade citizens so we know what icons are which? Also, maybe lock a few buildings that need prerequisites (like no blacksmith until iron is available for the first time) to prevent mistakes since 'so and so in exchange for so and so' can sometimes be missed to read.
- Bigger text. People with terrible eyesight like me might have to lean a little closer before being able to read some things.
- Bigger buttons. Some buttons you might accidentally press because they're small and right next to each other.
- The UI feels way too small and crowded. Maybe having a few of the option buttons on the bottom bar, or even the resources displayed a little larger on the bottom while the other buttons for options on your town are on the top?
- Quest box feels a little odd looking at it on the left side of the screen. Maybe on the right side or have a quest drop down from the top bar?
- Also maybe 'mass delete/bulldoze/edit/move'? It's handy sometimes when one makes a mistake putting down decor in the wrong area or just wanting to transfer them elsewhere.

Other than that, I love the game. It currently takes some getting used to for new players. It gets more enjoyable when you get used to it, but I would absolutely love it if the UI got better and more visual and new player-friendly.",1602314875,1602314875,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The pitch of ""organic"" city development is pretty hollow though, there are two mechanics for this ""organic"" aspect: housing and roads. Roads are really easy to manipulate and if you want to make a grid city all you have to do is make build a bunch of wells in a grid pattern. Housing is handled...oddly. Again it's pretty easy to manipulate, in fact you need to. While you don't have control over the exact placement of houses and their orientation, you still plan out where the blocks of housing will...occur? The most frustrating aspect of the housing system is that villagers will never move to a new home on their own. If you relocate a workplace and keep the same worker (something that's encouraged by the exp system) you'll need to destroy their house to force them to move to a house closer to their new workplace. This was especially frustrating with woodcutters which I tend to relocate their workplaces a lot to clear trees from new tiles. I got fed up with workplace micro and just left them as shiftless newcomers (the class of villager which doesn't require housing). 

I'm interested to see where this game goes and I think city builder fans will enjoy it but it falls short of its promise as an organic city builder. You are fully in control.

I'm currently trying out the new mineral update and the mining side of the game has been improved. I'm changing the review to positive although it is easy to tell that the current form of mining is only transitional.

By reading your roadmap on trello I have a feeling that you are going to make the game's house leveling system into a Caesar III/IV or Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom, i.e., emphasizing the role of market and variety of goods. Their solution is classic but I would personally like to see something new.

=================
old review:
i absolutely love the idea of a spontaneous city builder, however, the fact that I should not place rock gatherer near rocky mountains on the terrain ruins it for me. This game has an emphasis on pretty looks and natural feeling, but this one mindless decision ruins what they want to achieve.

This is because berries and stones, as the fundamental resources of this game, are placed at a fixed location on the map, without any reference to their real world scenario. So I am not able to make a small 'stone excavation sector' of my town next to a mountain or pick berries next to forests(if I do not plant trees next to the berries), which means I cannot create a spontaneous and natural look for my town — who puts stone mining industry in the plain, on the grass, and in the middle of the town?? And why is there a small berry plot out of nowhere, within some highly condensed houses, and no farmlands around it??
Unfortunately, the above scene is something that will happen all the time if you want the city to work efficiently.",1595597875,1601418888,True,0,0,0.549010872840881348,0,True,False,True

Pros:
Game looks nice and curves are mostly smooth.

The buildings are absolutely fun to do.

Cities look and feel alive.

Cons:
The weather system needs to be expanded for more than just rain. Some storm clouds with lightning and other effects would go a long way in making the city absolutely picture perfect.

 Management needs to be expanded in terms of seeing resources on the top bar. Some resources are there but not all and having the ability to see, for example, wheat or wool would be very helpful for identifying problems in our supply lines.

Help instructions needs to be expanded for everything. Maybe something like an encyclopedia book cerca 1302 would be a nice dash of realism and immersion for the game.

More building options when you build a church and all those. The building is the best part but it lacks depth with so little to play with. Also a width adjuster would be a good addition.

Overall great game though and would definately recommend!

I know this for certain because I surfed on numerous forums and even the foundationgametips website to see if anyone else was having similar problems.  
What I also found surprising is that you can still easily soft lock your game if you construct required future quest buildings before they even appear on the quest.  This was an issue when the game was released, and is rather shocking to see when the devs are still adding features into the game when issues like this are still prominent in the game's systems.  It shouldn't take a slight deviation in build order to break your quest, nor should promoting serfs seem so convoluted.

The economy mechanics of the game are very similar to the early (like 20 years ago) city-building games, i.e. production chains, citizens satisfying their needs, and desiring to live close to their work (but not too close if the place is gross ;-), promotion of citizens, trade, unlocking of buildings, etc.  

What Foundation adds is the ""grid-less"" layout and cute graphics, which had its positives and negatives for me. I think the idea is to allow you to achieve a different, more organic look to your city, which is especially demonstrated by the auto-development of residential areas.  However, just as in the old city-building games, the economic system limits your design creativity a lot. For example, I like the idea of a densely-packed, walled city with businesses and residences mixed together. That doesn't work well with either the economic or grid-less design system because of the residential desirability mechanic in the former case, and the auto-development of residential areas in the latter. Maybe I just like the idea of micromanaging the layout of the city more than others do.

Also, as others have said, the system of walls, towers, gates, etc. still needs a lot of work to be fun for me. I don't see a clear set of walls, gates, and towers that actually go together. The walls also don't do anything as there is no military component to the game, so it would feel weird for me to build them.

Many of these things seem very improvable to me, so I'm interested in seeing whether there are plans for further developing the game.

In contrast to games like ""Banished"", Foundation aims for a more ""wholesome"" and charming approach to the core gameplay, which I personally much appreciate. 

The graphic style is clear, yet charming, evoking incredible vistas as you continue to build up and evolve your city as you play. The game's performance is great as well, with no noticeable downsides. 

Foundation features several intriguing and fun mechanics centered around promoting your citizens, gaining splendour by building decorations all around your city and doing quests in order to gain certain reputation scores, in order to unlock further technologies. The mechanics are really intuitive, yet also manage to provide (some) challenge as well, which greatly contributes to a pleasant feeling of ""flow"" within the game as a whole; the lovely: ""Just one more turn""/ ""just 10 more minutes"" kind of feeling which this game really *nails*. 

All in all, Foundation is a rather fresh take (and a pretty one at that), on the city builder genre with slight twists and turns in form of theme and upgrade mechanics. 
The game is THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE for all ages, even in this Early Access state - with great promise to grow better and better as more content gets added in.

Once you figure out how to play, which is no small task given the vague instructions in the Help section.
It goes smooth until your village expands and suddenly your villagers become basically malcontents. 
Even if you fulfill all their needs, it seems that they look for things to be unhappy about. ie, I have too much wood or food in my workplace. I wish there was a way to better regulate production while keeping the villagers happy. I'm not forcing you to eat it all, give some to the unemployed, just stop bitching. I've yet to find a happy medium. And if they can't find anything to be unhappy about, they will cause their own unhappiness by building houses too close together, then complain they are blocked. On the good side, it's an interesting game that will continuously keep you busy for as long as you want to play.

TL;DR - This game is EXCELLENT in gameplay, but it needs fixing for User Experience

Basically, the devs need to put the brakes on additional features and revamp the UX/UI. 

The in-game graphics and depth is excellent and the potential for the game is huge, really huge, like seriously, it's massive, it looks fun, cute and inquisitive but in reality it's just frustrating, why?

So here are joy killing factors:
Scaling: People play on 50"" screen TVs now, 2x Scale doesn't do the job.

UI Art: The graphics of the UI are similar to that of Settlers 2, which is great if this game was 20 years old.
The way you assign items to stocks rooms is not intuitive. I tiny little icon appears in the granary for example when you only have berries and you're like well okay I've clicked it, theres the berries, why isn't it assigned, ah you have to actually click the berries, then later on you see it's obvious because the warehouse then lists tons of icons. Should be clear from the beginning. 

Personalised Villagers: The portraits for the villagers look like I drew them (that's a bad thing), another method should be put in for capturing villager portraits similar to that of Two Point Hospital. These guys have made the effort on the actual little villagers to look cool and cute, so they should get a random close up camera shot of the model to replace this hand drawn image, it doesn't make it look cool or fun making an old fashioned drawing to fit the theme, it's 2020, make it look nice.

Windows: Too many things open at once, and aren't easy to close and don't auto close. In some games you can just bang esc until all the windows close. Not in this one, you have to navigate to and click exit on every window. When a task is completed such as ""start construction"" the window should automatically close, the same thing for many other windows you guys are using. Maybe you just haven't implemented this yet, but do it, it's annoying having to close every window, fun leeching. I want more time playing the game, less time messing around with windows and moving them when they're off  screen just to select what I want.

Map movement: it's either WSAD or Edge Scrolling; neither are fun, there are no sensitivity options for the mouse or scroll speed.
In this day and age we are used to holding the mouse button down and dragging the map around to easily get somewhere, the current method of navigation is very difficult for new players (tested with my misses), I am very experienced in these games and even though I could navigate smoothly using wsad and the pitch and tilt I still found it clunky. This will kill off casual gamers if you don't make something as basic as navigation intuitive and familiar.

Icons & text: Just not big enough, I'm squinting to read almost everything. I'm playing in 4k and I expect a nice menu with a decent resolution and good art. If they've pulled the art off so well with the game, why not the UI? The UI is BAD really bad. I can't stress how bad it is and I'm 33 years old and played 100s of games it's probably one of the worst user experiences I've had.

Wind graphics: Everything sways, even the grass, nice touch but it makes me feel sea sick with absolutely everything on the screen swaying back and forth. These animations need to be limited in their movement range by about 25% and be less affected by game speed.

GamePlay: I've spent a short amount of time playing so far, and this is the number of things I've noticed in just over hour, that's not a good thing, the excellent designing of the buildings, characters and depth of things to integrate in to your city are being completely overshadowed by the UI. Fortunately I can over look the UI for a the game review and say the same play is awesome, okay maybe I can't overlook it. But will I go back to playing the game? Maybe not, not while it's so much effort to navigate menus which are ugly. I might even refund it and check back in a few months, I'm in two minds.

I really want to come back in a few months and find all of this fixed, and give these guys a massive commendation.",1599820445,1599825503,False,56,4,0.598952114582061768,8,True,False,True

And I love how you can construct the more complex monuments however you want! The church can be one building or a complex with a courtyard, for instance!

Plus there are a lot of questions not answered. I have to remind myself its an early access game because it is soooo not finished. The military content is simply send troops and hope they come back but it does say if you are likely to win or not. 
The buildings vanish in the terrain and into each other and when you design a building if it dosnt snap in place that bit probably wont work with the building. 
The population, not bad, they do their jobs, not very smart about it. You are so careful to make sure their work and home are close yet everyone goes and stands around in the town center and then look for their needs. (not smart) They'll even go to the town center, stand there for 5 seconds, then not get water from the well or food from the market and go back to work, work for a minute, stand around the town center again go back to work and their needs timer is almost up, they'll finally go get some food and water. This dosnt change when they have a house, in fact they hardly go to their house, but if they are a commoner or better, they better live in a nicer area. Lot of work to be done here...

Over all I enjoyed the game. Not much left to do but earn a few achievements  unlocked all the buildings, won a bunch of military victories, 5k gold and almost 300 population. The other maps dont really add anything to the game so lot of work to do. I wouldnt recommend the game at this state for $30. I got it on sale and feel I over paid.

My initial thoughts (subject to change) so far, 10+ hrs into the game: the bulk of my criticisms are surface level only. So far, the game's biggest issue is its lack of in-game pointers. Overall, I find the game pleasantly superficial,  I admit though, once you master the concepts, it is interesting and addicting.

PROS:

- The game in its current EA state is stable. No crashes so far, and I can tab in/out of it easily. 
- Its clear that the devs have focused on the minutia of resource management. This for me makes the game an exercise in technicality. You will have to plan your foundation out wel.
- The villager animations are good. 
- I like the in-game camera. I'm able to zoom in and change the plane of view with my mouse.
- I don't mind the ability to assign villagers to specific tasks. Having played Banished made me acquainted with this game mechanic.
- Once you master the basic concepts, the game becomes addicting.
- Overall, the game works very well for its Alpha state.
- Lots of minutia with resource management.
-Despite the lack of intuitive help functions, there are users who consistently help in the forums.
-Once you master the concepts, the game becomes more interesting.

CONS:
- There is a decent learning curve. 
- the scaling UI function at 1.5x looks like it is out of focus almost. 
- The game requires you to paint the surface of the land to designate its usage, either for resource extraction, land usage. It makes sense, until your villagers report there being nothing to extract despite a nearby forest. I'm not really a fan of this. If there is a general yellow boundary designating my village area, then the villagers should extract the respective resource within its confines. 
- Resource management games after a while suffer the same fate, generally speaking: they get tedious. 
- The GUI is horrendous, and the devs are working on this apparently. The boxes and font sizes are too small. They are also counter-intuitive and are not user friendly.
- There's a bit of a disconnect between the graphics and the GUI: the villagers are almost cartoonish but the GUI looks like a Microsoft Word document. The UI should compliment the graphics.
- There should be a way to minimize the box on the left hand side that floats there. 
- No major single player campaign yet, other than quests.
- The game lacks in its ability to explain how to get things done. Yes, there is a help menu before and in-game,but who wants to sit there reading for 20 minutes when first starting? There should be in-game pointers, arrows, clickable expandable links. There are audio cues already existing - why not add visual prompts? 
- I had no idea I could specify my bailiff to direct his mission until I clicked on one of the icons when he was ready for a new mandate. This needs to be made a cue or prompt in-game.
- Making villagers responsible for building homes isn't inherently intuitive. We should have the option of first building the homes and beautifying the areas. Whether they upgrade or not should be up to the villagers.
- The housing desirability is way too strict for starting missions.
- Being able to build chains of items (i.e. gates or bushes) should be an option, especially if they are needed in the game.
- Why is there still a village depot in the centre of my village despite me having a warehouse? 
- My citizens just idle in the centre of the square. 
- No day/night cycle. I hope the devs build this in.
-No atmospheric weather, other than occasional rain. Some fog, clouds, mist, wind, would definitely compliment the game.
- The trade panel needs rework with a way simpler GUI. It isn't clear how much I am selling or buying. 

It's clear in its build that the devs are an indie company. They've built a game with a lot of promise, but in order to make it more appealing to the average gamer, in-game prompts and cues should be added. We don't want to read a wall of text before starting a game. 

CONCLUSION:

Another indie developer adding their own flavour to an otherwise bloated genre. Once you take the time and read the menu, restart a couple of times and get the hang of it, the game becomes more interesting. It took me around 20 hours of starting/restarting and reading the forums to get going. Now, the game is easier and more interesting. In its current Alpha form, it goes look pretty detailed with options I have to admit. However, it needs more to pop to justify the price, but it's a good start. If the devs can add campaigns, and more building options and challenges, then it will be worth it and stand out in the crowd.

Like them, I was hooked for the first 5 hours. But unlike them, they don't tell you that everything gets repetitive. Hardly a challenge to unlock all buildings under the amount of time I spent playing. The neat part is the ability to build over slopes ( However, villagers may have difficulty finding a path to get inside... :/ ), and to pick and choose modular parts of the building to put together. Overall this was at most moderately amusing. 

Tried very hard to like this game and to get my money's worth but sadly, I'll be uninstalling. Gameplay was passive, predictable, and bland.

There is always a con so here are my cons. But being in alpha, it's not really a complaint because the game is not done yet. 

1) Painting fields and hunting areas is not intuitive. You can paint them too large and the workers assigned to them will only plant so much which leaves wasted space that has to be tweaked. 

2) I feel that lumberjacks need their own collection area paint. All gatherers use the same zoned area and there are times you need trees cleared in a specific area. You can plop a lumberjack hut into the center of that area as a workaround (they always to go the closest tree) but manpower is very limited in the early days.

Short review is: 
It's a fun game with some balancing issues and pacing of the game, for 40 bucks and still with this much of a build that is in alpha could be a bang for your buck (if they keep updating and adding new stuff)

Now for the long Review:
The core of a city building simulator is there and provide enough desire to warrant buying another type of building simulator. The game provides an interesting dynamic into building a town/city and provides a lot to do in the alpha and I really do hope they add more into the game to further diversify each city. however there are still tons of balancing issues and just overall game-play mechanics that makes it frustrating and overall needs a ton of work to make it simple but still providing a challenge to players.

The first main gripe i have about the game is the fact that the three functions that can help immigration are completely broken, Even if one of them is lower than the rest it will change the overall result to the lesser favoured result. 

Second is about religion. If you're going to make it a dynamic of the game then reduce the effect it has on the general population as i found it to be more important around my town with very little area of influence until you get the church upgrade (the church radius of influence should be the rustic ones radius, and then just make the church one bigger to allow those ones to be the ""end-game"" side of the church).

Third is about pacing of the game. I found that being at 1x was way too slow and 3x was just the right speed to be 1x. The game functions at a snail pace on 1x and looking at the time below explains why its so slow. Each second that passes in game is about 1.2-1.5 in real life seconds and tends to be more on the side of mobile building games than PC simulators. If each second in-game was equal to .5 or .2 of a second in real life would help the pacing of the game.

Fourth is about placing buildings. While I have no major complaints about the pathing of some of the buildings you place down. I understand having multiple paths for a building can help with the flow but when i have 2+ paths to go in and out tends to be excessive and only needs to be a max of two (one front and one back) 

If those issues are worked on and balanced it will push this game into a better experience for the player. I really do hope to see more updates to come soon from the dev team!

Overall, it's a great game that shows a lot of potential.

I don't often play singleplayer games anymore.
Usually they are boring, quick to end and not worth the purchase.
In comes Foundation.
Foundation is very fun to play for several reasons.

1.) Freedom.
You get absolute freedom when designing your village/city/kingdom.
You can grow as much as you want, but you can also decide to stay small and just upgrade, see how much you can fit into a small space.
The AI builds residences along the roads they create using pathing.
Their pathing is not always perfect, but you CAN control it using forbidden zones.

2.) Replayability
You can create all kinds of settlements, leave it up to your imagination.
You can create a massive bustling CITY with beautiful churches and bountiful taverns and flower gardens.
Or you can do challenges with very hard to develop land and try to create a proper settlement.

3.) Price
This game is Early Access with an Early Access price.
None of that full price Early Access crap.
The game is not complete and it's still in Alpha.
Many more things will be added so the game in its current state is worth around 20 - 30 euros/pounds.
This is market value, not personal value.
I believe this game is worth more than the latest Call of Duty or Battlefield based purely on the amount of fun you can have with it as well as the replayability.

4.) The developers have a clear view of what they want to achieve.
The developers know what they are creating and they are creating it.
It's like a throwback to the 90s where games where made by a couple of people with big visions without deviating from their vision. In a world where most games are made only with making money in mind, this is a true gem. It's been quite a while since I've been able to write a truly positive review on a game.
The developers have my full support in what they want to create.

Note: Keep in mind that this IS Early Access.
You WILL run into problems such as crashes, instability and bugs.
So far I haven't had MAJOR problems with bugs, but I have had crashes.

 I just noticed that there are endless updates...but why couldn't they at least make some effort and tell people how to play the game. THERE IS NO TUTORIAL.

Because it literally has a good foundation but everything is very early access; It has the makings of being a good city builder sim like the others in the genre, however in it's VERY early access state it's a no from me.

Like with most of these city builder sims you get to run your very own village, build up, and survive against hostile threats or the elements whether it be the weather kind or the sickness/virus kind; There is no tutorial level of any kind, only tutorial objectives at the beginning of every 'build' scenario, be very aware the river map (riverside or whatever it's called) is extremely broken or rather poorly implemented, that map forces you to essentially stick to land for most of the build before you even think of building your very cool riverside city.

You do get rewards from completing objectives which is nice (kinda of).

The biggest turn-off though will be the $30 pricetag for an early access. It's more of a $20 to me or lower, because of how much the game needs work, which btw the developers are listening and responding, etc.

Trick is to not rush through the citizen tree.  Have enough of all the underlying resources before moving on.  Keep an eye on your resource management, if you are running out of stock prepare more production before it becomes a problem.  You can get tons of money and unlocks by just focusing on the second tier.  Then expanding when ready.

Looks solid for a EA title, and devs seem to be working on it a bunch,

The good:
Organic village is legit.  The way roads are made and things are laid out on the map keep me from making my standard ""formula"" like village, and it looks more realistic.
Core gameplay is fun, managing the village and growing is exciting.
""Painting"" zones actually works really well.
Building your own church/castle/etc is cool and works pretty well

The bad:
Easy to quickly get into a ""mood spiral"".
Lack of content and depth currently.

Wishlist:
Expand on the military options
Give me some charts for goods production / consumption
Why do warehouse/granery workers only bring to the warehouse/granery? I want them to deliver too
Show me a water delivery map for my wells, same with food delivery.
Needs more citizen upgrades to keep going.
Tips on what each ""class"" considers a requirement instead of looking at each person
If someone leaves randomly let me easily fill their slot.
Breakdown of how much warehouse workers are spending doing xyz
How many goods are available to trade / in demand?
More events.  I enjoy the good rainstorm 100x, but its easy to prepare for.
Selecting a role to fill when it becomes available as a citizen joins  (autofill)
Vehicles to transport goods?
Show villagers paths they are taking for XYZ

Add custom scaling to UI because 1x is too small, 1.5x is too much. Some icons don't convey meaning too well. Needed to get real close to the monitor to understand them, this issue lays within the UI elements being too small. Plus I'd rather have a more modern UI. The current one feels, well, not modern.

These things can be fixed. What I think won't be fixed is the housing system. The game lets you select the residential area where your peasants/citizens can build however they like. Which is an issue. It is supposed to be ""natural"" but it is more ""chaotic"". They just build the most random way. Which does not look good most of the time.

Some warehouses and granaries hold mats to be sold both on your markets and trading. You need to build quite a lot of them in order to get many mats stacked up. It would have been much better if you could upgrade them at least once, for the sake of visual because at that point your citizens have stone buildings and these are still wooden and look barebones and for the quality of life reasons.

I could honestly go on and on about these things. I am a bit pessimistic about the future of this game because most of the problems lay withing the foundation of the game. I am not sure how willing the devs are about going back and fixing stuff.

However, there is still place for improvement, especially for balancing the economic system (moreover for village over 200 pop.)

If you're into Medieval city builder sims, resource management, or enjoy a laid back way to spend a few hours a day, it's worth paying the full price.  Replay value is there, although after several cities founded, the game tends to get a bit redundant.  I've only got a little over 12hrs in game and still look forward to getting home to expand my city, but can see that excitement waning in the near future.

The grid-less building system and the node system which lets you snap additions/add-ons to your buildings is the best feature. The store page calls it organic and it really is. Every city you make will come out different and looking natural like a medieval city should.

The way you manage zones by 'painting' them is another great feature along with how the townspeople 'cut' perfect roads themselves. It's so nice.

It has very light mod support right now -not much to choose from but, I see that changing.

Unless the Dev's do something crazy, this game is only going to get better than it already is. The intro price point could be a little lower but its still fair for what it offers right now.

However, I feel compelled to take the time to write this review for this game. Foundation has the potential to be one of the best Medieval City Sim games ever in my opinion. The two main things that really stand out to me are the unique building design and organic city growth. 

The ability to create custom buildings that take advantage of the vertical landscape really makes the design aspect of this game special. You can build your Keep on the highest hill, your Lords Manor jutting out into a lake, or your church hanging off the side of a cliff. I find myself spending a lot of time just trying to find the coolest place to put my unique buildings. 

The natural growth of your city really makes things more interesting than placing 4x4 housing blocks all over. The pathing takes care of wasting time building roads. If given the choice, I normally end up making all roads straight and joining at right angles but I am so glad I can't here. 

Lastly, since purchasing this game, it has improved drastically. The developers have continues to churn out new updates while the modding community has helped produce additional maps and production chains.

While it might be clear I really like this game, it is still very much in an alpha phase. The UI and build menus need quite a bit of work but I am sure that is already something being worked on. Honestly, fewer pathing errors than I expected but it happens. The quests are super minimalist and simple but are helpful. Would be nice to add some additional text and options to the quests to add some variability. 

I am really excited to see what the future holds for this game. I'd probably buy it again to support the team if a deluxe edition is ever released. If you're a fan of the city sim genre, you should definitely buy Foundation.

(Version A 1.6.18.0729)

1. Money
My total wealth wont rise (it's always between 0 and 200) even though my weekly balance is always positiv (between 30-100). 
Moreover the statistics have no explanatory power. There are heavy fluctuations. The overview over of the villager's mood has no explanatory power either, because the mean doesnt show statistical outliers. Especially with a big amount of villagers.

2. Houses
When I level up my Villagers they level up their houses too. But at the same time they move out and build new houses. Moreover the roomates move out too and also build new houses. So I have a lot of uninhabitated houses. And they remain empty.

The  proportion of time and distance is not realistic. For example my farmer lives one house away of his farm. The Villageroverview says that he walks 30 min. to his work. 

3. Overview of lacks of satisfaction. 
A geographical overview of the  lacks or supply of satisfaction (and wich needs in particular) would be helpful (like the areas), because, so far, you have to check each villager's mood individually and most of the time they are one the way to satisfying their needs. In adition the mood gets worse too fast and disproportionate. (A villager ist in a bad mood because he cant satisfy his needs during work even though there are enough possibilities).

4. The demanded amount of churches and markets
The demanded amount of churches and markets is absolutly unrealistic because it is to high. In my Village I had to build a church and min 3 markets in every sector.
In addition the amount of Villagers that can get in the Church is too low. In a small church or chapell can get only 20 Villagers and in a big one 40. 

5. Villager level up menu
I can not see the way the villagers are sorted in the level up menu. This makes it hard to find one particular villager who lives in an area where it makes sense to level him up. 

Apart from this Foundation is a fantastic game with a lot of potential. The 30€ are a bit expensive at the moment. The game has to improve to be worth this price.
As I said I have a lot of fun playing Foundation. I'm curious about the development and I'm looking forward to the finished game.

It takes a while to get a village established with steady treasury revenue coming in (using trade routes and the local markets) but once you're past that point and things are stable, it becomes more enjoyable and focused on people and resource management. 

I really dug into it during the initial release but became bored after hitting some of the first limitations with village growth, expansion, progress, etc. After taking a break and coming back to it recently, those limitations are now gone and I can make further progress; albeit with a new village since my older saved games were no longer compatible with newer game versions.",1596263418,1596263418,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- do not play this if you want to do optimal builds (it does not exist)
+ play this if you like to make a nice living diorama city - and get a zen like feeling from it.

Residence and buildings in this game may not always grow the way you expect it to be. So just like gardening, you set the zone and boundaries, you place certain key materials with a pot, and let the plants grow.

If your not happy with it, you cut out things you are unhappy with it, you trim out and discard what you dislike and try again. Making you focus more on general layout and looks of the city rather then specifics

---

Part of the reason for this, is two parts

1) Its rather easy to keep things stable

Once you got your logistical line setup (and unlock forestry), there is almost nothing in the way of disrupting your flow. Except a few minor events, which is rather easy to ""over-produce"" and stock up to guard against. Its also rather easy to ensure your whole town is in excess of cash positive, as long as you focus on producing your goods locally, rather then importing them.

Also with cash holding having an ""upper limit"" there is little to no reason to ""horde cash"". You can easily setup your city to be +200 gold per turn, and never look at it again, as long as your not trying to do anything too drastic. You could literally (if notifications are disabled), leave the game running 24/7 with no worry.

Puzzle solving of logistics is also relatively simpler, A gives B, which can be used to make C. So while it exists, to make you think lightly on how to setup your city in a balanced way. Its really not that difficult. And its there really just to set some ""framework"" to your city planning process.

2) The lack of optimal layouts, or optimal anything.

While you can optimize layouts, or even villagers to specific jobs. Its general impact is less then 10% difference in ""productivity"". You could pretty much ignore it. If you want optimization, you could even stack building ridiculously close to each other due to their proper lack of collision detection. But that just ""looks ugly"".

You can pull off ridiculous chains, of building 1 territory apart, and they will still work ""ok"". So organizing your production can end up being more of an design choice then a requirement.

---

So because optimization is meaningless, and that slowly building has little to no difficulty. Does it mean its boring?

Yes for some folks who live for the challenge.

For me and a few others, the act of ""gardening"" and designing around the framework alone is the fun and the goal. Slowly expending, and redoing here and there.

Residential Zone is literally 5 cm from their workplace. No one builds a home for 25 minutes. No new villagers come and I go bankrupt. READ MY FULL REVIEW DEVS!!! All your wonderful videos showing the builder crafting items and all the happy people equal a corvette. Lifting the hood of the corvette and finding hamsters on a wheel for an engine for the actual playing experience equals a complete waste of money. Fix the core game play (Period)

1.6 update review: The update has now added more issues. 1) Broken path-finding: Dev notes state they will now walk through buildings with multiple entry points. No they don't. They go in an out of one entrance only. If you paint the path red to make an area forbidden, they will walk completely out of their way to continue using the same entrance. 2) Purchased new territory. Lost the 500 gold because it never expanded the territory. NOTE: This appears to be working now as I haven't been able to repeat the issue. 3) Stock maximum no longer working for Granary. Everything gets moved to the market. As a result you cannot complete food based quests unless you remove the market assigned worker temporarily. 4) When building on a hillside buildings will not set into the terrain; IE - for the dairy farm parts will be hovering in the air and look stupid. 5) Balancing is broken for character generation. 21 male immigrants in a row. My village has 37 total and 31 male.  Read my original review below. How the Devs can continue adding features without addressing simple fixable issues is unacceptable. I really thought this update would improve game play but I am left disappointed.

Original Review: I have 42 hours invested into this game. Let me start by saying I see great potential here but at the current time I cannot recommend this game. I am a programmer, so my view may be tainted slightly but it is also because of this fact I can share concerns through different eyes. They are releasing a major update on July 14th and introducing awesome, cool new items into the game. That sounds good in theory but when you are in alpha and have not addressed core details that leave the game broken, this is why I cannot give a thumbs up. It is a shiny new corvette that looks amazing but, when you raise the hood you find a lawnmower engine. Here are the things that should have already been fixed that are not: 1) The characters run out of names at around 70. Your player name will be Male # 12345. How is it there are already Mods to resolve this problem but the Dev still has not taken the time to fix? 2) You can place housing zones in prime real estate territory but the characters will not build homes. There are many discussions about this on the forums and if you google the game. There is no way an alpha should have this issue. 3) Path-finding completely sucks. Characters will walk through trees and create paths straight through gray colored cliff areas. It makes the overall appearance look cheap and outdated. I really want to love this game but how can you be releasing cool new features when you will not take the time to fix things properly? Like I said, my view may be tainted because I know many companies that shortcut quality in their coding while trying to wow you with BS. Please fix this game because it is a gem.",1593891700,1595791077,False,137,2,0.730368971824645996,10,True,False,True

Pretty randomly i decided to replay a week ago and ran into typical problems when reaching 100-120 population. The update has solved these issues and i was able to reach the final-final late game with now around 300 pop and all public buildings buit and a stable ecomony that looks like it could scale infinitely.

Pros

Atmosphere:
The game succeed at creating a great ""Settlers"" & ""Anno"" atmosphere that gives you the right sense of achievement when your city grows and you add a new supply chain to your town

Simulation Complexity/Promotions and Monuments:
Apart from the basic but still challenging aspects like providing food, cloths, tools and managing your income, Foundation has two intruiging concepts that add great complexity and dynamics when scaling up your city. One new, one old but well executed: Citizen promotions and monuments (Town Hall, Churches, Forts and Tavnerns). Promoting your citizens (like in Anno) leads to unlocking new buildings but also increases their demands and will have them build nicer houses...but you better be ready and have the resources and more importantly monuments available for the new desires. Good luck if you bit off more than you can chew got carried away and designed a massive church...not only will it take too long to build, it depletes your few resources and the upkeep once finished can ruin your income and will mercilessly kill your small city. 

Zoning: 
If you played SimCity you will be sort of familiar with this. You will have to create zones for housing, extraction, hunting and reforestation. Your villagers will build houses themselves if the requirements are met but be careful. Villagers want to live close to their place of work, the want it pretty (dont create housing zones next to heavy industry or plant many bushes), and want to be close to a well & market. Since every single villager is simulated they will have to spend too much time just fullfilling their basic needs and will be highly unproductive in their jobs...or even worse. They will remain homeless because he housing zones are just too far away from his place of work.

Play Time:
I'll keep this short. My latest city has reached 277 pop and i have achieved everything possible except for some ludacris steam achievements. It took me 13 hours to achieve this. Its not quite SimSity but has is up there with Banished, Dawn of Man an other Early Access Sim titles

Cons

Military Missions and Depth:
I know this is not a core element most players seek when starting a Citybuilder/Sim game but they decided to include it as an essential aspect of the game. You cannot progress without building a fort... you need the prestige points to unlock buildings to address the needs of your higher class citizens... Creating a small military (5-7 sims have to be coneded to the fort where they will receive combat training and equipped with swords should be capable to win the easier early military missions. If you are vicorious you will receive some ressoureces which is nice earlier in the game but later on there is no incentive at all to send out your troops. No mandatory missions to appease the king, not threats to your city you have to react to, no maidens to rescue nor special bounty you cannot produce yourself. I am sure the devs have some ideas here but this still feels very unfinished.

Education/Science/Progress:
Lets keep this short. There is non. No Schools, no libraries, no scientific skill tree, no teachers (the scholar was removed in the last patch and i think they are back in a conzeptual phase on how to include this concept back into the game)

Skill Tree/Prestige Unlockables:
So how to you progress and unlock new buildings if there is no science tree? Foundation has a prestige concept where you gather prestige from 3 groups to be used to unlock new buildings, monuments and other bonuses: The King(military points), the Clergy(faith points) and the People(builder points).
The problem with this is that you also unlock buildings just with reaching threashholds for each level of citizens so it feel arbitrary as to why some builsings are unlocked with prestige and some but by reaching threashholds. Also, the unlockables are just too few. You unlock everything somehow fast and the new unlocks do not feel extremly rewarding. 
Example: "" Wow, i have reached 50 faith points. This required thousands of hours of labor, hundreds of stones, tools and planks and finally i can reach the 3 tier of unlockables...to be able to add decoration to my church? To get access to a hunters lodge?"" In the early game they do this quite nicely with unlocking ESSENTIAL buildings like the warehouse in the builder prestige tree but later on it feels like they have run out of ideas.
I hope they shift some of this to the ""science & education concept"" once they have programmed this. That would both feel more logical and would better differentiate between actual new technology and more prestige to be able to build cooler, bigger and more useful monuments.

Dear Devs, if you read this: Hats off. I bought this game pretty early and felt really lost when first playing it. There was great progress when i returned last time a few months back and got a hang of it but always ended at the invisible ceiling when had not yet solved the housing issue. The latest patch really solved this for me and the new craftmansship concept works very well. GREAT JOB! Looking forward to the next content pack. Keep it up and let me know if you'd like more feedback.

I selected ""Recommended"" because I think the game has a lot of potential, but there's way too many issues.

I'm never usually one to complain ""why are you adding more content when you haven't fixed the bugs/issues?"", but in this case I feel like it's true.

[h1]PROS:[/h1] 
Mainly, graphics and building.

[list]
[*] Graphics and design style. I love that you can zoom in to any of the buildings and characters and see them in detail, and it really makes you feel immersed when you can see your village from the ground level. The tilt shift is a really nice addition.
[*] The ""organic"" way paths are created by the villagers and the way you build structures and they adjust to the terrain. While there are sometimes awkward alignment issues when building on slopes, the game does a pretty good job at it, and you can usually fix it yourself by just rotating or repositioning.
[*] The way you can customize buildings and the unique snapping mechanics.
[*] How forgiving the building system is, allowing you to overlap buildings and components to make them align exactly how you want. You rarely ever run into overlapping issues, which can be frustrating in other games.
[*] The way the villagers can be assigned a tasks and then they just move about their day automatically (however, it can often lead to some buggy issues).
[*] The mechanics of ""painting"" zones and painting fields.
[*] The way villagers automatically build and upgrade houses, organically.
[*] The game has a decent amount of content for being Early Access, though my main concern is that you unlock everything way too quickly. After maybe three nights of gameplay, I felt like I had unlocked almost everything in the game.
[/list]

[h1]CONS:[/h1] 
[b]The game's user interface is terribly designed and convoluted.[/b]
[list]
[*] There's WAY too many interface menu buttons that it becomes difficult to find anything, even after playing for a while. Some of the interface's icons are duplicated (the ""zones"" icon appears on the top right, and then at the bottom left, when the two could just become one menu). A lot of the interface buttons and screens could be consolidated. On top of that, the icons are poorly designed, and some have different sizes and design styles. A lot of the interface's dialog boxes were super cluttered, chaotic, and really hard to scan/read. Item names and prices are not aligned properly, etc. 
[*] The item icons are also super tiny -- like they were designed for an 800x600 resolution game.
[*] Trading is a bit confusing. It's unclear if trades are being made, or how to figure out if they are, and the interface for trading it is pretty unintuitive. 
[*] There's no context or explanation on where to obtain some items. It would be nice if hovering over any item would remind you which building or location you can obtain this item. I never figured out where to get Marble, for example.
[*] While the building mechanic is unique, it's also pretty complicated and convoluted. For example, when you build a structure with like 10 parts, it will have a section on the interface for every single part, adding a ton of unnecessary clutter to the dialog boxes.
[/list]

[b]Unfinished labels, variable names on interface, and things that feel pre-alpha[/b] 
[list]
[*] In my opinion, having exposed variable names all over the interface is inexcusable for a public game -- especially for a game that's been in Early Access for well over a ear. You'll see things like ""SOCKET_1"" or ""Villager left because he lacked IMG1"" or ""Reserved at MarketPart4"" or ""ACHIEVEMENT_A1_XXX"" just ""#"".
[*] Also, the game's FPS is prominently in the top left of the navigation
[*] Once you get like 50 characters, the game runs out of names, and they become Female #1234 and Male #5023. Seems like they could easily add more names or just add a last initial.
[/list]

[b]""AI"" and pathfinding bugginess[/b] 
[list]
[*] The villagers sometimes won't do the task they're assigned to do, but there are not always error messages on why they can't do their job. (Or, the error messages are hard to understand).
[*] Villagers sometimes would not recognize that a farm zone was ""painted"". This was a really frustrating bug, as I had to rebuild farms a few times, however, this bug seems to fix if you pause the farm and then start it again.
[*] Pathfinding has some issues. Villagers sometimes create unusually long paths and don't go the direction you want them to.
[*] This is minor, but villagers just stand motionlessly in town square when they're not assigned to anything, which looks really weird. Seems like they should at least roam around.
[*] Villagers sometimes won't build houses, even if you've zoned a large ""desirable"" area. I noticed a lot of other players complaining about this.
[*] Apparently the default map does not have water on it, which is really strange because fishing seems to be something you obtain pretty early in the game. There were characters that requested fish, so it was strange that this would not be on the default map, or at least they should take fish out of the list of items on that map.
[/list]

[b]Game is too easy, not balanced enough, and not enough strategy required[/b]
[list]
[*] After unlocking the first few sets of buildings, the game becomes WAY too easy and you feel like you're progressing way too fast. 
[*] I was maxed out of money for pretty much 99% of the time playing. I didn't feel like I needed to be strategic about anything, and I could throw money at any of the [few] problems I had.
[*] It starts to feel like you're just running through the game mindlessly with little strategy -- just letting time unlock things and complete tasks.
[*] The one difficult part of the game, which was actually pretty frustrating and not enjoyable difficult, was that happiness felt too volatile. While I was able to keep my villagers happiness very high for most of the game, there were a few times where I upgraded too many villagers too quickly, causing their happiness to drop because they didn't have enough items. The happiness dropped so low that I couldn't save them, and villagers just mass exodused. IMO, the happiness change should move a bit slower.

Pathing errors, galore. Gridless building is a gimmick, organic zoning results in houses inaccessible to residents. Distance traveled by workers seems small, but is traveled so slowly to make the economy totally inefficent. If I can't control the location of residents, then how can distance between housing and jobs be relevant.

Lots of bugs... sometimes jobs just stop getting worked at all, with no explanation until a new map is started.

Can't recommend in it's current state... reading the priorities of upcoming update suggest it will get worse before it gets better.

10/17 Pathing issues persist. Zoning  / gridless issues appear worse than previous. to keep budgets reasonable we must have better control over housing locations. See how bad it can get here:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1892076294

This is an extreme example but a valid one.

1/15/2020
Zoning issues persist. Problem is magnified now that housing is required for happiness.


1/30/2020

Issues with empty housing space persists. Per earlier updates housing just doesn't occupy spaces that are large enough for it.


7/16/2020

1.6 Updated review:

I like the way this game is going, but the housing zoning is still acting super wonky. Housing doesn't fill out properly. few buildings are built in space provided, high desirability land is left empty. It's just weird.

More than anything playing the game makes me wish for plop-able housing like other games of the genre. I realize that the 'killer feature' of this game is the 'organic' housing, but it still isn't working right after extensive development time.

I like to start off by saying this game is super fun and hella addicting, BUT i have some suggestions that would possibly make it better. 

1. I believe making the townies have more diverse character styles would improve the immersion of the game. 

2. Is it possible to add marriages, the church feels empty and i think having occasional weddings would be awesome..

3. Life cycles. I personally don't like that the only way to get more people is by them immigrating to you. It would be cool to see your townies actually living. Getting married, having babies, and eventually dying.

4. Speaking of death, there should be way more deadly ways to die. Scenarios like poison berry bushes, natural disasters, and plagues. 

5, If you do decide to add kids, could you add a school building and fun medieval kid decor.

6. Roads. it is really hard to make them create paths the way i wanted them to make them, can there be a easier way to set up paths. 

7. Water textures is very low quality i would like to see a little bit more detail, maybe some waves on the beaches. 

This game overall was really fun and you aren't even done developing it. I cant wait to see what you decide to do in the future. I hope you add some of my ideas, if not that's ok, i will still think Foundation is an amazing game.",1594703070,1594703070,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

*HIGHLY* recommend this game for anyone that even remotely likes city manager or sim city style games.  This is by far one of the most brilliant games I've seen.

There is no grid system (except for buying new town land), and no paths other than the ones your villagers create.  Put a lumber camp right on the other side of a grain field?  Congrats, you now just created a path through amber waves of grain.  

The graphics are simple, yet pretty.  While the game is still pretty early in development, I would like to see upgraded villager faces and models.  The wavy grass and fields I mentioned earlier can be intoxicating to watch.

The monument system (manors,. churches, keeps, tavens, and monasteries) allow you to create awesome unique works of art while also being useful.

By far the thing I love most is how things just kind of grow naturally.  All you do is paint where you want your villagers to put up their houses and they choose how it fits into your public buildings.  Really reminds me of the way the villages are laid out in Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and for whatever reason it makes me really happy,

The music is also very good.  Noticeable, but not annoying.

Keep in mind that it is still in early access.

Systems work well enough but getting to learn them is all through trial and error. You learn more on the fly than the tutorial is able to provide. It tells you how to do things but there is no indication of repercussions or what a lot of the things even mean. All of a sudden your economy is booming and then you go into a depression in one day. Of course it's your own fault but there is no way of monitoring that. It turns into a bit of a knife fight every now and then until you learn to control rapid development and expenses - at which point you can really enjoy the non-grid based, creative side of building in this game.

The game has an immense amount of character and even though your world space is not randomly generated, you are free to recreate and optimize your settlement in hundreds of new ways. The terrain being constant is not a set back but an opportunity. Constant updates provide reworked systems and added content frequently. If you don't mind a bit of homework and slogging the first 20 hours then this is a really awesome city builder for you.

The AI does a good job of looking after itself for the most part. It's very good about recognizing and using the zones you make for it efficiently. The AI created roads are nifty, where they are makes sense so you don't end up with really dumb roads all over, and the AI seems to be pretty sensible about discerning when it's better to take an existing road vs making a new one. It's overall pretty sandbox-y, which is honestly what you tend to want with this sort of game. (Or at least I do!)

Since it's Early Access, I do think it's important to make note of a few flawed things. I don't consider these a reason to write the game off, but for anyone on the fence about Early Access games, weighing up how much in progress features will bother you is pretty important. Wait if these things will bother you, to have a better experience later. If you think you won't mind these? Go for it! It's a fun game!
- The UI has basically no polish. I consider this fine, it's minimalistic but it does do its job without throwing a bunch of UI errors at you. 
- As many other reviews mention, the tutorial is pretty bare bones. It IS there, but it's essentially a brief in-game text guide, rather than the hand-holding walk through that forces you to learn like most games have. 
- The economy is a little ... volatile. Your income can flip around very quickly for strange reasons.  
- The keep feature, as a friend I streamed the game for put it, ""sucks"". The best thing to do with it is build one to progress, then forget about it entirely. 
- The stocking chain is a little silly, but also realistic so it's not unreasonable. Super short summary: You need to assign a lot of people to move your goods around through various steps before they're used. 
- The supply/petition missions are broken; They can [b]only[/b] be completed from a [i]warehouse[/i], but frequently request food which can not be assigned to a warehouse. (Food goes in granaries.) This reputation currency is used to unlock some late important buildings. The NPC/notification to get them is also lacking.

*The issue with the Lord's Manor and gold stocks has been resolved.  The game now has built-in early-game quests that lead you in a very natural progression to learn the game and set up your early economy.  The Lord's Manor is now one of the easiest buildings to unlock, and so the loss of gold is not an issue.  Also, there are a wide variety of quests and special events with varied benefits and negatives.

*There are now a number of helpful tools in the UI for managing villagers, which mostly eliminates the need for directly selecting them.  Villagers also will shift between houses on their own to optimize distance from their workplace/market/well/church, eliminating the issue where they would just build a house wherever there was room, and then be perpetually angry because it would take them all day to walk to work and back.

*Because of the way the game has evolved, having to click the X to close building menus is more of a benefit than a problem now.  It's often helpful to have multiple buildings open at once.

*Trade feels a little more natural now, including trade boons for completing quests helping that faction.  Still kind of wish for resources to be a bit more map-specific, but the game is so beautiful and streamlined and fun, I feel guilty even saying it.  Leaving my original post and first Edit up so you can see the progression as the game has evolved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, this game is one of the most fun and addictive I've played in recent years.  I had been craving a game with free-form building, and I took the chance on this one...and I was not disappointed!  If you enjoy free-form building (like the settlement-building in Fallout 4) you will not be disappointed.  If you're looking for a Medieval combat simulation with building as a central mechanic, this is not the game for you.  The most combat you get in this game is sending soldiers off to help defend the kingdom in exchange for money and land.

The game is still in development, so there are still some clunky elements--your villagers start to get stuck on building elements and each other once things get crowded, there are still some place-holder text lines, and that sort of thing.  But the game is beautiful, the monuments with their sticky elements are very user-friendly, and once you get the hang of the interface, the game is very easy to learn.

Now some details.

Things I love:
The overall concept is incredible.  There is something immensely satisfying about the way the villagers build their own housing.  The combination of free-form building and painted districting overlays is brilliant.  The villager animations are adorable.  Designing the monuments--especially later in the game when you have lots of component options--is very fun.  The difference between monuments and public buildings, which are unlocked by beautifying your city/gaining influence with a power faction and upgrading your villagers respectively, is a clever game mechanic.  The basic concepts of the game are similar to games like Age of Empires, where you build resource collecting buildings and assign villagers to that resource, which is very intuitive.  It's just a relaxing, immensely satisfying game.

Things I wish were different:
*You are limited to 500 gold at the beginning of the game, and it is only by unlocking the Lord's Manor that you gain the ability to raise your maximum capacity--a relatively difficult monument to unlock.  Meanwhile, the Wooden Keep is an early-unlock monument that opens up combat quests which give a 1000 gold reward.  The extra gold is lost, which in a game where your gold reserves fluctuate wildly, can be quite frustrating.  I wish there were either no limit, or a 1000 gold limit to start.
*Selecting villagers is very difficult as they are always moving, and you can't click-drag a select box to catch one or more.  This is alleviated somewhat by being able to assign idle villagers to buildings directly at the building, but there is still no way to assign Builders without clicking a villager directly.  I wish there were a population management screen where you could make villager assignments and track your population's needs and happiness.
*Selecting buildings opens up a very helpful window, but the only way to close it is by clicking an X.  I wish you could close the window by either right-clicking or by selecting the building again.
*The trade mechanic is relatively simple to learn, but it is currently highly tiered and immutable.  Trading refined resources is part of the economy built into the game, but I wish the resources you were able to trade was either randomized or variable, so that playing the game didn't feel like a trial and error experiment in learning which buildings to build in which order, but one in which you had to react to the resources you have available.
*I enjoy the quests, but there are only a few that keep popping up; many of which aren't possible to complete.  I look forward to more being available.

All in all, it's already a good game, if you're looking for what it has to offer.  I was, and it was the best game purchase I've made in ages!  But it's definitely obvious that it's a work in progress.  I can't wait to see what the end product will be!

Update:
I have now played the game for some 14 hours.  I take back some of my wishes--unlocking the Lord's Manor is not so hard as I had thought, once you learn the game, and having large quantities of gold is not nearly so useful as having large quantities of trade goods to sell to your villagers or other towns.  After spending more time with the game, I think making the trade mechanic more complex would make the game nearly impossible to play--you need to be able to sell certain goods and buy others in order to make the town viable.

I do think it's a worthwhile thought that perhaps the kinds of goods you can produce should depend on the terrain type chosen at the outset.  Like maybe wine and sheep for mountainous regions, grain and honey for the river, fish and dyes for the coast, etc.  And then the trade cities (and goods available/desired for trade) should be different depending on the terrain.  It felt weird growing grain essentially on a beach, and that I was well into the mid-game before I was able to build a fisherman's hut.  BUT, these are minor complaints/suggestions.  Still a freaking amazing game, the more I play it the more I love it.  It truly fills me with joy every time I open it up.",1549738502,1593795482,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game runs very smoothly (albeit on max settings my computer averages about 90FPS but with a population of 100+ on screen and everything working away I don't experience frame drops) and I'm looking forward to the next update very much. 

My only gripe is I wish there were something akin to Dwarf Therapist in game (a popular management third party utility for Dwarf Fortress) which would allow seeing the skill levels of all villagers at a glance, being able to assign them to different work places, and perhaps allowing an easier way to unassign and reassign jobs based on distance from where they live so I could be more lazy with how I construct residential areas.

I'm not put off like some people with various small-form UI for management but I would like something unifying to allow me to easily manage villagers before I find myself 6 windows deep in comparing the employment of one workshop with another. 

Also, I noticed there was at least one negative review commenting about there being no guides... I didn't have any issues exploring the UI to see where certain structures and components were found. I thought it was pretty straight forward for most things with the exception of doing a quest for providing a set amount of a certain good, where I had to spend a couple minutes figuring out that you needed to order that item be stockpiled to prevent people from running off with them. 

Perhaps someone unfamiliar with how town-builders function should try Kingdoms and Castles, as it may be a better introduction than hopping into Foundation (but seriously return, this game is good right now and has a lot of potential).

Otherwise, the only things particularly ""early access"" I experienced were a breakdown in villager naming where villagers would not be dynamically named like Charles or Olivia and occasionally become Male#3245 and Female#3542.

And lastly, while Foundation gives tools to help coerce the pathing system and trim around the edges with replanting trees, I would love to have some subcategories for zoning specifically forbidden land and reforesting. 

I wholeheartedly recommend Foundation to anyone who enjoys city builders and colony sims looking for something a little different than the usual grid-game.

-The game needs more focus on the military aspect - soldiers neither acquire experience nor level up.
-Terrible creation of the army quests - vague quest info, underdeveloped missions. I have no idea what im doing and at this point it starts to get annoying.

I went into this thinking it's gonna be a medieval city skylines in the way. The game is rather too linear early one. I've had to start 3 new games because I keep hitting road blocks that seem to be a fault due to bad game design. 
 
First up the help guide inbuilt into the game is lacking any useful info and poorly written. I had to look up a few play through videos to make any sense of that. I think they should include a Tutorial level to get you through the basics. I don't like how much you have to micro manage everything, and I mean everything.  

The first game I played through even though I did well resource wise couldn't figure out why the villagers were unhappy and leaving. Second game hit a rock with gold and couldn't figure out exactly how trading worked. The trading system is quite confusing and I think it comes down to the language the game uses and how you have to set up 3 different things to trade one item. Then the third game I played and after watching some videos on how the trading system works, I hit another wall when there were no tools to even build the warehouse to trade for tools. So it seems the game is pushing you in a linear path where you have to build exactly a b c d first and do exactly this for it to work well. If you decide to play outside of this you will hit so many walls. 

I think they need to pull out quite a bit - some aspects seem unnecessarily overly complex. The UI interface design could use much better improvements. Text is far too small to read, hire a UI or graphic designer. Set some line height so text isn't so squished. 

Also Don't use icons as a mean of communication. ""your villager is unhappy because of {icon}"" - I can't really make out exactly what the icon is suppose to represent. There also seems to be missing assets. ""{icon} is requesting an audience."" 

I kinda wish it had a simplier or easy version. Like city skylines how it has an unlimited money optional play style for days were you just want to build for the sake of building. I think they also need to rethink a few mechanics and have it not be so linear and have some other work arounds to issues/walls in the early game so I don't have to start a new game so many times early on.  

It had so much potential, I just hope they iron it out a lot better.",1593264640,1593264640,False,18,1,0.552854180335998535,0,True,False,True

Graphics are gorgeous, I'm playing on a low end machine and I still think they are lovely, the people look like they have seen things that had rather not.. also they don't blink which is horrifying 😂 I love their little tapping walking animation though. 

So really my review entails it's a good, fun game, it's probably going to get better with updates, it's not worth the £30 price tag for the way the game is now, but it will be in the future if updates keep coming out.

1) The dev team is incredible. They're active on Reddit and Steam and are extremely helpful. The updates have been very regular and each update build is better than the last. 
2) The game is incredible. If you like simulation/city management games, I think this is best in class. There's just something about it that works perfectly for me. It's medieval, which is my favorite part. The organic pathfinding for roads is a really fun mechanic. I spend a lot of time trying to trick the AI into making straight lines and grids, but also love the city-mosaic feel of having unique lines and finding what buildings fit best in the organic paths. The city and resource aspect is challenging and fun early, mid, and late game. I usually work through the early and mid-game to nurse my resources to good health, and by late game I'm mostly on auto-pilot and working to build the larger monuments. 
3) It's in Early Access, but the devs are very regular with updates, usually once a month. I've never been more impressed with a game in EA. It feels better and better with each update, and I can tell the game is going to be amazing when fully done. 

Ok now for some Cons, just to be fair. 
1) May not be for you if you need a tutorial. The tutorials are very brief and not in-depth. It was a little stressful in the beginning when I realized I'd have to just play and play and hit Reddit to figure everything out. But I did! It was totally learnable without the tutorial and actually very fun. 
2) Organic pathing feels weird coming from grid style games. Sometimes it can be hard to get your buildings to line up straight. Still fun though and I've grown to love it. 

So in short, I absolutely love this game. I think it's great for anyone who loves medieval setting and city builders/city management games. I've recommended it to everyone I know who likes those things. The Cons list is very short for me. Thanks for a great game Devs!",1593040576,1593040576,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

While the development has been slow, it's also been steady, and has a discord where the developers are open and communicative. While the UI is extremely basic, the game has a beautifully cutesy look and atmosphere to it. 

The game itself is both unique, yet similar. It's a game where you build up a medieval-ish like town and manage the populations needs. That plays out exactly as you'd expect from any other game that's similar. 

What's different about this however, is the way the AI behaves, and how you manipulate it. You don't decide exactly where houses are placed, or paths are made. (You do build everything else though). The AI decide that. You do get tools to manipulate this however. ""Housing Zones"" you can draw, and the AI will build houses in that area. The AI will walk paths, and those paths will over time upgrade the more it's used.. from a barely noticeable path, to a dirth path, to a stone path. The Ai will try to use these paths as often as possible making a natural pathing. If you don't want the AI to walk in a certain area, or build in a certain area you can designate ""avoidance"" zones, which force the AI to go around. From there you can build and upgrade with decorations.

This makes cute, fantasy like towns naturally form as you and the AI work around each other, the screenshots are examples, even on the side of hills. 
--------------------------

Another big take away is that unlike other games in the same genre, you don't feel like you can get yourself stuck in a downward spiral of chaos due to a few bad decisions early on, or not perfectly balancing things out. (Some games are especially bad at this, where if you don't build just the right of x thing, and have a warehouse x units away yada yada). The AI in this game are the absolute best I've ever seen.

For starters, you don't have to worry about getting a scout and putting down signposts so your people know where to go; they go automatically and the entire map is revealed from the start. (Thank the Divine for that).
Secondly, you don't have villagers making other villagers - you have to create your village to be good enough for people to want to join in, and it's a really smart indicator on how good your village already. A very creative way to grow, and I like it a lot.
Thirdly, the graphics are a wonderful cartoon-like style (which again reminds me of cultures) but is definitely more pleasing to the eye (and if you're someone who has to have 'better graphics' then this is should be a plus for you).
OH! The sheep. Thank to whomever is obsessed with the adorableness of sheep as I am, because SHEEPS APLENTY! Bonus, if you get it during alpha, you get to build sheep statues EVERYWHERE! It's beautiful, and the caption for the statue is just perfection. The sheep don't have animation to move, they glide around (which to me is honestly hilarious), but the best part? When you purchase sheep they are small, lamb like, and when you have the speed all the way up you can watch them grow large with their fluff in real time, and it's perhaps one of the greatest things in gaming because SHEEP!
Ahem. Moving on.
The building aspect in this game is something that I've been craving for the longest time. FINALLY! A game that lets me build my buildings how I see fit. Yes, they give you presets and yes you have to unlock parts, but honestly? I will take it, because sometimes you just want to change some things, or move some parts around only to know you cannot, and it's just created that way. This game - the whole idea around it - allows you to build it from 'scratch', as much as it can be, and it really fills that void that gaming has lacked for a long time.
Are their building games out there? Yes, but sometimes you just want a little added something to village games, that they don't provide. Like Settlers 6 for instance, you're building your own great village yeah? But you cannot design the buildings as you want. This game you can. Make sense? (Gods I hope so lol).
Another funny thing is that sometimes your fisherpeople won't have boats, (don't ask why, they just don't, maybe boats are offensive to them who knows?) so they will walk/glide upon the water like Jesus and show everyone how it's REALLY done. Which imo is glorious, and I hope that never gets changed, because who doesn't want a village filled with deities that can walk upon water?
The only thing that does bother me - but it will get fixed, however idk if it was reported as an issue? (too lazy to check atm) - is that sometimes when you click on certain notifications to see which exact building is built; such as the markets etc., it will send you to a far off corner of the map and you will have to find your way back to where you were. A wee bit annoying, but the maps aren't big enough to really be a nuisance, and there is a pause button (which btw I don't think Cultures had that, so HA! Take that!).
All in all - without spoiling too much - this game is pretty well polished for what's given, and it's a lot of fun and very relaxing to play. If you want to build things, but not REALLY from scratch - just enough to scratch that itch - then this game is for you. You get to choose how the buildings look, and start your own village. The instructions are all clear, and googling anything that you cannot figure out is all easy to find, because this community is open and very helpful and the devs are active on the forums as well.

- This ""top-down"" style has been adopted by many game (the Civilization series, as a big example)...but the detail of the world when you zoom in to EYE LEVEL to the actual citizens is incredible. Unmatched by a top-down game.
-The end-game is truly what you make of it. Don't understand what the ""end-game"" of the game is yet?  If you want to build a civilization to 500 people, try to do it! Turn off your population increase, save the world, and you've always got it to come back to if you want to expand again. Unlike other games, you NEVER lose progress. You can just rage quit a map, hop on one from months ago that you forgot about, or start a new one. 
-The learning curve is incredibly linear. Once you start the game, learning a new aspect (like how much food a population of 50 needs) seems daunting. But once the mechanics are figured out, you can REALLY start to create your own world. 
-Micromanaging is actually FUN. I'm not a gamer that likes hours of inventory management...and I've never had the hours to pour into Eve online. Civilization is expasive and fun but you don't get the visual asthetic of knowing (or caring) when I new citizen gets his/her house. But in Foundation, knowing where all (hundreds) of your villagers each live, eat; how many tools each of your 30 warehouses have in them; the route the SINGLE trader takes into your town(s), all these little micro-managing aspects of developing your own civilization is just incredibly satisfying. 
-The game-pace is 100% up to you. One of the many reasons this game is simply so ""playable"" is because you can simply stop your game-advancing production, population, and building, to focus on, let's say...making your town look gorgeous for 3 weeks straight. Or, you can immediately buy all the land you can muster, expand your military, take part in everything your ""mystery king"" wants you to do, and spend hours placing/building things to advance your civilization.

It's in Alpha and I'm creeping on 90 hours...in 9 days.

Well... It looks like latest hotfix (Hotfix 1.6.1) solved most of the crashes and I haven't encountered any more crashes since it was released. Although there is a significant way to go on the project, I decided to recommend the game at this point to encourage developers and to respect their eager to solve those crashes.

I discovered game only crashes when my military troops are out on a military mission. So I stopped sending military troops to missions and haven't seen any more crash yet. I will check latest releases/hotfixes and update this review.

THIS GAME IS GREAT!

After playing many days and many months, Devs are still coming up with beautiful additions to game. This is my next ""Labor of Love"" content 100% 

Keep up the good fight guys!

---------------------------

While playing this game I felt the same amazing feelings when I first time play Settlers 1 (aka SerfCity or Die Siedlers...). It's a beautiful game!

Foundation is really different than Banished or similar survival city-sims, it's more likely a Settlers combined with Dawn of Discovery series. One big move in Foundation is you don't choose where exactly a citizen builds their house. You just paint a ""residential area"" and wait for the settlers to move in. Sometimes the randomness of the building positions are actually frustrating since they just can spread all around their houses wasting space or get way too tight and buildings glitch on each other but I guess this is a performance issue of alpha.

I played 70+ hours not because people build their random houses... I did because the biggest thing in this game is, every important building is a ""monument"". So imagine you're doing wonders in Civilization; wait your people to build the monument slowly and once it's finished you have that familiar satisfaction :) I made such a big Monastery, it took me 3 real days to finish it all (part by part of course) and now my city is being fed with honey and got drunk with wine.

This game has a huge potential and I'm really happy that I backed the developers in early stages. If they'd want more support, I'd gladly provide because I really really want this game see the light of the day.

KUDOS to all developers working and constantly improving the game and I strongly recommend whoever wants a medieval city sim.",1562966257,1590656261,True,10,0,0.664725601673126221,0,True,False,True

To be fair and completely honest it is not a game for everyone. Do not play this if you dislike middle-management. It isn't fully macro or micro. You can manipulate the AI in many instances and there-in lies the challenge/fun. In a way, a realistic world to play in. ""Free will"" villagers being told what job they have and where to build but given the freedom to find the best path to ruin your future plans. You have to learn to enjoy the lack of city ""blocks"" and embrace the organic building and expansion.  Once you master handling the AI and can predict paths you can let your building skills run wild. City ""blocks"" can become possible if you give the town time to build up money and resources- turning the town into a city and then the challenge is just to keep them fed while you build, build, build to your heart's content. 
Being an early access game means a lot of things. One important thing to remember is that it can only get better if you give feedback and time to the creators to make the experience better. Trashing the game seems a bit rude and premature - like yelling at a kid for falling off his bike when you never gave him training wheels. 
Enjoy this game as it is. Accept the flaws and share your opinions so it can get better.  The fact is that for the stage the game is in now to be so incredibly fun and engaging is a testament to the skill and imagination of the developers and only speaks to the greatness this game can be if given the chance. 
It is a time investment, to be sure, to get to the ""end game"" - which i consider being so wealthy in gold and food that you can waste hours building massive projects. But, it is worth it. You'll run into glitches, bugs and the like. ie.- wheat farms suddenly shrink their production at a certain time/population; or that berries are apparently the only thing anyone wants to eat and at a point of massive size your city can't keep up. But, even with these late-game issues, the journey and experience is worth it for those who love city-building/planning games and are looking for a unique take on it artistically and mechanically.

The thing that makes Foundation stand out is what the developer calls ""organic development."" Rather than laying out grids, you designate residential and industrial zones with a paint brush. This creates districts where your villagers build houses according to desirability (proximity to amenities/jobs and distance from dirty/noisy industry). This gives your town a pre-modern vibe, with curvy streets and spontaneous development. You can plop important civic buildings like markets, keeps, and churches to promote growth and the happiness of your subjects.

Speaking of subjects, Foundation is also a resource management game. As the new lord of your territory, you'll need to provide your serfs with jobs, food, and material. If these needs aren't met, you're land will be wracked by hunger, insecurity, and population stagnation. If you're a good lord, your serfs will be happy and you're settlement will attract new residents. Do you're job correctly and your serfs will gain skills that will help you grow and manage your realm. You'll also need to train and kit out knights to defend your city and participate in your feudal king's martial adventures.

Again, Foundation is still in development, but it's a really cool game. My only complaint is that I wish you started out with more land. You start out with a tiny swatch of land, which is hardly fitting of a new lord. Even worse, there's no room to begin laying out the beginnings of a health village--when you start your're forced to build your keep, industry, market, and housing on a couple acres of land.

TLDR Cons: Needlessly complicated and sometimes unknowable mechanics, janky interface, lack of substantial information/documentation on current versions of the game. Very much an early access game still so know what you're getting into.

Random tips that might help first time city builders (as of April 2020, happy quarantine):
-Build multiple markets and wells to increase the desirability of residential zones. The more manned stalls included in markets, the higher the impact to the nearby desirability
-Build multiple warehouses and granaries in different areas of your city, and diversify the resources held. These buildings serve as common stops all other trades, for example: builders need stone, wood etc. to carry to their job sites, and the closer the warehouse is to the jobsite, the shorter the travel time and hence faster building times).
-Scale up your food production quickly before your population gets out of control. Diversify food supplies and stock markets with as many options as possible. Berries and fish deplete if overharvested. My rule of thumb for berry harvesting is one foraging hut per berry bush, this will never deplete a bush.
-Different classes of citizen (serfs, commoners, citizen, etc.) require different resources to be happy. Citizens need wine and fancy shit, for example. Don't rush to promote your entire population to citizen or even commoner, as it is easy to be overwhelmed by the sudden demand for a luxury resource.
-Military missions have multiple phases and you get better rewards the more phases you complete (at increasing risk to your soldiers) - missions marked ""extremely difficult"" I have found have the potential to drop blueprints. send all of your soldiers on these missions - it takes in excess of 10 or 15 to have an ""extreme"" chance of success for these most difficult missions.",1587808316,1589668083,True,29,2,0.77381134033203125,0,True,False,True

Lack of real tutorial in the beginning was pretty frustrating but eventually got by it. Figuring out why various items and buttons exist became fun, such discovering that a decorative bush actually does something besides being decorative.  Have enjoyed almost every minute. Well, except for the hours of headbanging while trying to figure out 
(a) why won't people build houses in this perfect area I prepped for them (People in the game are apparently just as pigheaded as people in real life. Accept it and move on until the devs fix it). There are some things you can do, but it takes some figuring out.
(b) how to arm my soldiers (wow, is that what that little box next to their name is for?) and 
(c) food levels in late game - food just seems to disappear.  My solution was to build lots of granaries. I mean lots of granaries.  Filled them up and THEN added population while being glad the devs have yet to introduce rats, mold, and fires into the game. 
Balancing happiness, citizen mix, employment, buy vs build, and residential capacity can be challenging and so are enjoyable. Liked the achievements (black sheep - nice throwback) and looking for more.  
Additions I'd like to see: 
-seasons, 
-population aging/children (in development, I know), 
-more food types (orchards, etc.), 
-more product chains (cattle producing beef  as well as - or instead of - milk, gem/precious metal mining for making the jewelry, etc.), 
- more trade possibilities beyond the current three towns including by sea, 
- increasingly challenging [optional] quests from envoys - for many rounds being able to send 30 berries to help the clergy was practically impossible, but after a while the appearance of an envoy became a bit monotonous but you need to keep doing it to maintain the trade bonuses.
- more disaster types than just months-long rainstorms 
- thieves, ruffians, bandits, etc. to track down to give soldiers something more to do than go off to battle far away

Overall, the game as it currently stands is a 5/10, a pretty but ultimately just time-killer'y game. A lot of the fun of this slow, methodical city builder comes from building these great custom monuments and buildings, however there are quite a few tedious aspects that inhibit the (in my opinion) fun of the game. Most of it is just standard EA-launch issues, like unclear tooltips (like how many of one material gives you another), barebones UI with unclear or too-small icons, poor balance (easier to simply buy some foods/drinks than to actually farm it), and missing features (for example, you can spawn unlimited sheep/cows at the moment, and it's completely unclear what more or less of them actually do). Beyond about 6 hours into a city, less if you know what you're doing, you'll more-or-less have everything unlocked. From that point, you can either keep building to see how large you can go, or begin building massive custom masterpieces. Other than that, the game doesn't have a lot to offer yet.

Stellar and appreciated. This game is money well spent. If you like banished, sim city, stronghold, or any other city builder you will not be disappointed. Bummed I waited so long.

So much potential, and I look forward to updating my review as it evolves. This may literally end up being one of my favorite city builders of all time by the end, however after pouring in literally hundreds of hours I still cannot figure out how housing works. Yes I have read all the discussions about it and even created one of my own, but just when I think I've pinned down all the ""rules"" for where a villager will build I create a zone that no matter how close to workplaces, how high quality, or how large it is they just won't build there. I think it must be bugged because it is completely unpredictable. I understand the desire to have cities have a ""holistic"" feeling and therefore not allowing players to define roads, but this is a digital zen garden, it should at the bare minimum be predictable. Also the pathing that villagers choose just because there is a pre-existing path is pretty ridiculous sometimes. they will go around three edges of a square on an existing path instead of blazing a new path down the one side of the square. 

Two changes would make this a 9/10 for me even in it's early state. 

1) Allow players to build houses. Don't do away with residential zones that build wherever for only 10 wood,  but for those who want a house in a particular spot why not let them? You could even make it a little bit more expensive late game option. A mayor/landlord certainly could do this back in the day. Why not in this game?

 2) Allow players to build roads (perhaps at the cost of stone?) and have the villagers prefer roads (albeit perhaps less heavily than they currently prefer paths). Bottom line is forcing player to play your way doesn't work out well.

No point of talking about bugs or unfinished features. Neither are game-breaking and it's Early Access.

The good news: You get what you expect. Cute munchkins woozling around doing stuff. Refreshingly, no military action.

The bad news: You get what you expect - and four major design flaws.

1. Population Growth. Your population grows. And grows. And then it grows a little more. Don't get me wrong. I appreciate feeding a bunch of freeloaders, whose only job it is to swamp the church ""service"". But honestly: If there is no big, red butoon to stop the influx and they don't take a hint by seeing a beeline of unemployed, shouldn't the game's name be ""Soup Kitchen"" instead?

2. Railroading. City builders build functional segments. Over and over. SimCity offered three different segments in 1989, but OK, OK. I get it. It's too much to ask for more than one functional segment thirty years later, let alone hope for more than three. But that's not limitation enough. No. The building materials of the individual structures enforce one single sequence of construction order. Which is further dictated by one single enforced sequence of trade rerlations. In the (supposed) immortal words of Chuck Yeager, ""That job can be accomplished by a rabbit with a wire up its hind.""
3. Money. I honestly cannot remember a single game that fell even marginally into the builder category, in which money was this useless. Since the construction order is mandatory, there are only two ways to go broke: Buying too much land too early or, alternatively, building too many treasuries in the forlorn hope to feel like earning more makes a difference. In light of this, it is almost not worth mentioning that the program is too dumb to count and the money flow is, for lack of a better word, nebulous.
4. Growth. What can I say? In the current state, the program cannot handle more than one storage location per good properly. Sure, build all the granaries you want, but put one on either side of your realm collecting, for instance, berries, you will witness the transporters marching for 2 berries across the map. In other words, with one location you can easily sell a surplus (for whatever this is good in this game), but with two, you see your storage dwindle. Typical design flaw of AI decision making. Guess what? If the devs can't handle it, maybe they should program a platformer instead.

In the end, my disappointment is a very basic one. Why buy this game? It has nothing, that makes it stand out. Not a single feature I remember ten minutes after stopping to play. Not a single feature that hasn't been played to dust in the 1990s.

Is it really too much to ask to come up with the occasional neat idea?

Still needs some work but has alot of content and is becoming a beautiful game, my previous review should be below I think. (not sure how the reviews work as this is the only one I have reviewed so far)

---------------

I think this is my first review, I feel it is warranted to discuss some thoughts for those considering purchasing this game.
Firstly I love this genre of game, big fan of banished (450 hrs played) and feel this game will be the next step up from that

Overall I wish I could mark my recommendation as neutral with potential - Have marked as Not Recommended at the moment largely based on the pricing for this stage of an Alpha product however the Devs seem to be motivated in updating it regularly and does have alot of early game enjoyment and stability.

Positives:
- Gridless building is great, the freedom to place buildings almost anywhere gives it a natural look and feel.
- Natural sprawl, (not for everyone from the videos I have watched) I like that towns people build their houses in their own way (within your set zone) and create their own paths/roads making each gameplay unique
- Dev humor, if you look close you can see parts of the developers personalities come through with the kooky cartoony characters and little puns/jokes but not overdone to take the shine off the overall feel of the game
- Early Gameplay, has been fleshed out very well, the buildings and features work well to encourage further gameplay
- Art Style, to me this is an appealing artstyle, soft on the eye and allows enough color and creativity to make your city truly yours without ruining the settler/medievil style.
-  The Devs are updating the game on a regular basis

Negatives:
- Expense, for an  alpha with a long way to go I took a gamble on paying what I rarely pay for a fully produced game, the first couple of hours I was happy but once the mid/late game lack of content and bugs arose I would have refunded if I could. (keeping in mind I am a poor family man :P )
- Mid/late Gameplay - after the first couple of hours it is obvious that the game is not complete, there are buildings and resources with little or no purpose as yet and functionality of those buildings is lacking and leaves you void of progression in any way other than to continue to expand the existing services. For an Alpha I don't mind a lack of polish such as names of units being ""male2538"" and general bugs but when I hit a lack of progression speaks a bit about flow design and how it appears to be a bit rushed out at this stage. In saying that I can see where they are going with it and just hope it continues.
- You are a game tester paying a premium price
- No real tutorial, if you are not use to games like Banished then you could get lost quickly 

In Summery:
This has SO much potential to be a brilliant city builder if the devs can follow through with what they have started. If you love the genre and happy to watch the game develop over time and hope that it reaches its true potential for it's premium price then this is a good purchase for you. I recommend holding off on your purchase until the development has progressed, though without funding it may not progress, Catch 22. If it were half the price or you have the extra cash to splurge (unlike me :( )I would say absolutely give it a go.

Disclaimer:
It is obvious that the game is still in development since there are many things that have no tool tips or system to really figure mechanics out outside of trial and error and the game definitely needs  more tools to watch service access etc. There are also unfinished mechanics mid implementation.

All that being said I love the game ! First of all it looks great, it's a lot of fun and there is a lot of detail to construction process and basic operation of buildings/villagers. It really sets the game apart from a few other other builders that are in development at the moment.

It's challenging if you are into efficiency :D and you get to try a few times before you get things right. Since there are no grids you first have to learn the mechanics in which the NPCs act before you can start optimizing.

Overall it's worth the money if you are into city-building !

Here is what I would like to see improved in order of my personal priority:

clear overview of what needs each villager rank has/which goods they will start buying

clear overview of services that are accessible to each house (The overall happiness shows the amount of people and shows a picture of what the need is but there should be a way to clearly see which houses are affected by lack of service/goods provided.)

More ways to spend gold, maybe festivals or some way to increase productivity of certain chains by having the maintenance cost increased significantly. It's one thing to be over-capped on goods its another to not really look at gold since quite an early stage of the game. I'm just constantly over-capped, worst case scenario I wait a few days for it to refill.

More requirements to building chain progression, it doesn't make sense to get a cheese maker when I am 2 promotions away from being able to utilize it. There should also be a better overview that clearly shows that for example monastery is mainly a production building, it's hard to figure out at the moment as well as how to assign workers there.

Resource list by category, consumables, raw materials etc.

That's my bit hopefully someone finds it helpful.

I'm currently stuck somewhere about 12 hours in, and all of a sudden ""'x' villagers lack space for housing"" messages keep popping up.  This despite the fact that housing space has been dedicated literally everywhere, map-wide.

Possibly due to this problem (not sure?), my population is stuck at 90 citizens.  My current citizens are smiley-face happy, but for the past three game hours no passers-by will join my community.

Don't know what to do for now but quit and wait for either better software or some documentation.  Too bad that this looks like it has potential.  All I'm really saying is that this game is... extremely rough.

I will list some  of my success tips to help any struggling with the game. My current village has 146 people and not 1 has left the village as well I have a gold storage of 3000+

Tips: Build a strong economic foundation before promoting your people  in status (serf/commoner/citizen). Build slow to keep an eye  on all going  on in village and address people needs as you see the happiness fall below 90.  Click the villager list tab in lower left of screen and look for people without happy faces. Click on them and see what they need or want and address it. Go further and check their work place and house locations  by clicking those 

If they need religion build a church near by them. Remember a church will only service about 25-30 people max. If you have 100 people you better have 4 churches in ideal locations for max coverage. Never promote too many people to citizens without top tier structures in place and you need a Monetary with monks for wine/herbs/honey. You will need some citizens to unlock this but only do min until you get the foundation for the economy which runs those  industries  up and running

Build  at least 1 market for each of the following that you sell berries/bread/fish/cheeze/cloths/honey/wine/herbs. Your people come to the market each day to buy different goods bases  on their status and without the option to buy these will be  unhappy . A basic need  of  people  is water so spread out a few wells  in your village for people to access them you will see how it increases desirability for residents to live  near a well

Trade with other villages  thru the tab in upper left of screen. In the start I only buy tools until I make  my own then buy nothing. But do sell things I make for added income . Be sure to set min/max sliders here, I like to set max buy tools at 10-15 and usually anything I sell to all over 50-75

A quick glance at your total resources tab in upper left of screen will show all your resources. If some  of the numbers are 0-25 I may consider building another structure to beef  up that resource. Many structures can employ several people at it so I like to max employment at those structures before building a new  one

Lots to experience and learn in the game as I am on my 3 village do over and finally getting the balancing right now. I am excited to try some  of the player created  mods in my future villages, most notable expanded warehouse/granary and trade with additional villages  mods but there are tons  of mods to look at and try which will keep you experiencing new things

The longer version:
I came to Foundation from Banished - I love Banished (830+ hours of game time), and I have to say, this is better, MUCH better. Sure it is early access so the devs are still adding stuff, sure the workshop in Banished has more mods, but Foundation is clearly going places and doing it in style. It looks great (IMHO, and in a fun Disney animation sort of way), it is stable (100+ hrs and I've never had a freeze, fatal error or CTD), both the pathfinding and AI seem remarkably good punkt - even more remarkable because it is early EA, I also get a steady 60FPS until very late game  on a GTX 1080Ti when it drops into the mid-40s. There is a good, if not expansive, selection of buildings and production chains already available that are buildable all over the map - yes, the models can cope with being placed on very steep slopes without hanging mid-air or being buried in the ground. 360 degree rotation, adjustable heights for many pieces and 'build zones' that allow you and the plebs in your village to build anywhere and at any angle within the zone mean you really do end up with a natural looking and 'organically' shaped medieval village with winding main streets, tiny alleys between houses as well as mini plazas around wells and at road intersections.

The monument buildings  - Manor Houses (2 skins), Rustic Church, Stone Church  (3 skins), Castle and Monastery (3 skins) are all modular construction sets with multiple building pieces (rooms, walls, towers, ornamental bits, doors etc) that allow you to manually adjust the height of individual pieces and can either snap together or be freely placed (with overlaps or gaps) that allow you to create genuinely unique structures.

This is not an overly difficult city-builder - your towns can certainly fail at any point if development becomes unbalanced, but you won't have the sort of nightmares that were created by traffic management issues in Cities Skyline. Gameplay has some other interesting premises - for example, you as the lord are responsible for building and maintaining everything in your realm (buildings cost gold to build and maintain), the gold for that comes from selling stuff to your villagers (haha - stuff they produce and you then sell to them), villagers can be promoted (costs you gold) from newcomer to serf, commoner and then citizen, but each level of status adds to their demands (newbies need almost nothing, citizens demand luxuries). People don't starve to death in Foundation, but unmet demands reduce happiness, this reduces immigration and then people start leaving and....you know....defeat. People also don't want to live near smelly/noisy industries so not all workplaces can/should be right next door to homes, which adds to the zoning and pathing complexities of balancing quality housing with access to market places and work places. Buildings and abilities unlock with milestones (often linked to the number of villagers, their status,the prestige of your town based on what you've built and whether or not you've completed some fairly simple missions to help out your people, king and/or clergy), this forces a more natural development path - sometimes you just can't build stuff even though you can financially afford it because, for example, a cashed-up hamlet of 10 berry pickers don't need a massive concentric fortress to protect them. Such a fortress of course also needs space, and land to expand an ever growing village also costs, although at this point I have found gold to be pretty easy to come by, but not being able to lay out a wide variety of building across the whole map at the start of the game means either waiting to buy land to build or build it here now and then knock it down and build it over there later. 

This is turning into a book, so I'll stop now, but hopefully you get the idea. Again, in short, would I recommend Foundation? Hell yes.",1586778001,1586778496,True,1,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,True

This game is very good. Most of my comments here are about historical, political, and military realism aspects. That I'm thinking about those things at all, instead of complaining about road-laying, zoning, agents' path-finding algorithms, grid getting in my way, etc., speaks to the outstanding job the devs have done on the fundamentals of a city-builder game. 

I had wanted a medieval city builder game for a while before I discovered Foundation. For anyone familiar with Crusader Kings 2, I wanted a game that would let me rule a single holding in greater detail, basically be a baron / mayor / bishop character. This game is really close to that, and getting closer with each update.

I'd love to see the game feel more uniquely medieval as it develops further--more like Crusader Kings, less like Banished. Some specific things that would do that for me personally:

- Military threats. Incursions by raiders or the liege's enemies, consequences if the liege / King loses a war (e.g. new conqueror imposes heavy taxes), etc. Give the player a reason to build walls, make him or her afraid someone's going to come loot and pillage everything the villagers spent all that time building. 

- Troop levy interface. There could be a button and function in the existing UI that immediately turns every male villager of a certain rank (e.g. all serfs) into a novice-soldier, looping until all soldier dormitory capacity is filled. 

- Rebellions. Angry villagers or soldiers could attempt to oust or murder the player, causing a gameover.

- Diseases. There could be general epidemic modifiers, similar to ""Bad Weather"". Or the game could monitor the player's population density, and increase the probability of epidemics in denser, late-game cities.

- Draft animals. Horses or oxen should pull plows (speeding up the sowing phase of the crop cycle or increasing land fertility) and carts (speeding up transporters and increasing their carrying capacity), and die when they're not taken care of. Could also have a wheelwright job to make carts. 

- Royal visits. The king could visit the player's late-game town with a huge entourage, consume obnoxious quantities of food and luxuries, and then leave (supposedly that happened all the time back then, the liege rode around eating all the vassals out of house and home).

- Baths. Bathing could be a need starting at commoner or citizen, and there could be a bathhouse building staffed with bath-tender jobs and taking wood or coal as inputs to heat water.",1585745018,1586512464,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

We are currently living in strange times and I am so glad I have come across this as it is a great way to take you away and concentrate on something else. It is the classic city building game, but it has a feudal setting and the best thing about this is how the cities grow organically.
This makes such a huge difference as you can really shape your city. There is some zoning of the city and and you can zone out your farms, residential, extraction and reforestation zones.
The came really does look good as well with an atmospheric soundtrack which adds to the game.
This game is still a little rough around the edges and could do with a little more polish but that shouldn't detract from what is a great game.

In my game, at the moment the fishermen seem to be able to walk across water and the boat is missing. I've nicknamed them Jesus. Not sure if this is a bug that has been reported but thought I would report it. Another suggestion I felt would be great is related to following a citizen. When you click the crosshairs icon it zones down on them but it doesn't seem to highlight the person, so if you have a crowded street it is difficult to find them. The same for where they live.

This is like Banished, Cities Skylines, and Anno 1800 all combined. It's fun and satisfying.

To anyone questioning whether or not they should buy because people say the game is impossible past 100 people:

Buy the game. The sale isn't huge, but the game's worth it. Around 18 hours in and I've had no issues managing my colony aside when I'm really not paying attention to resources. I have nearly 400 people now.

My only suggestion for the devs is that you change how the transportation and storage of goods is handled. Warehouses and granaries are annoying to micromanage using a socket based system. Make them general storage or specialized storage, but let them store any resource of that type up to a limit without having to choose only 4 resources per storage.

Adding a goods transportation system like horse carriages would help out immensely. Villagers sometimes walk close to 10 minutes to find resources despite having some already nearby. Speeding up all villagers would be silly, but specializing a job to transport resources -from- warehouses -to- workplaces faster than villagers just walking makes sense.

Other than that, I'm liking the game and am hoping for more added features so it can stand a bit further out from many similar games.",1585349602,1585974102,True,72,3,0.866273939609527588,1,True,False,True

1. This game has great potential to be great!
2. In my opinion, it is not worth the current full price for the unfinished product. Get it on sale tho.

Now the review. Most of my platy time has been spent idle and running while I'm typing this. I cant see more that 10-15 hours of non-repetitive play in this game as it is, but there are regular updates and an active developer.  It plays like your typical city/empire builder with resource management, production lines etc. Resembles games like Settlers, Knights and Merchants, Caesar, Zeus, Pharaoh and other single player strategy games. Like some of those games the military campaigns (quests) are off screen. The population builds their own houses in areas that you designate residential with resources from your stockpile but you can limit their development. Another feature that I like is that you get to build centers like churches Strongholds and City centers that you can upgrade. The maps are large so you can build out and up.
Unlocking new buildings and production lines is done through the centers (Labor, Kingdom, Clergy) and by promoting citizens. This is achieved by providing them with all of their needs as listed on their character pages then by paying to promote them at the end of the month. A screen will pop up and prompt you.
After a while the game runs out of names and starts numbering your citizens by Male#1434 for example.",1585963575,1585963575,True,0,0,0.471698105335235596,0,True,False,True

This game's graphics are a great. Nice choice in art style. Music and theme is well put together. On an i5 with a gtx 970 which handles well with a large town, so far. Load time is very low for new towns. Larger towns may take longer than usual to load from saves. 

This game's townsfolk are interesting. Some are nameless as your town grows (as of this review), which kind of ruins the immersion. The citizen progression is nice to see happen. There doesn't seem to be any citizen relations other than markets. Social interaction might be nice to see. 

Thanks for the UI scaling option! I can't wait to see what happens with this game.

As an early access game, ""Foundation"" has some instances of unpolished mechanics. An example of ""not exactly done"" is: after a certain amount of villagers the names become Male(or Female) #____. having the names be serial numbers from the get go would be perfectly acceptable its just odd seeing Gustaf and Female #1707 chopping wood, it has a prisoner vibe. i am currently unable to maintain population due to a lack of happiness, (WHICH IS MY FAULT) I would have REALLY appreciated a quest line tied specifically to maintaining happiness.

Very fun game. But later on it's basically just increasing the general size of the town. There didn't seem to be any need to build walls or something to protect the villagers as there was no thread against the kingdom. Also tried to buy more weapons as I had 3500 gold nearly all the time which was pretty sad. It would also be nice to select which villagers are in need or what exactly. Hard to tell which 50 out of 150 villagers are missing a church or something ieven tho I build the whole area to have a church and market and some sheep statues. xD

Btw saw the black sheep and it is very nice. ;)

Keep going. Also. I like the freedom to build a big lord mansion etc. Let's the creativity flow a lot. I find that very advanced.

To make the game a bit more interesting it would be good if there were some enemy troops attacking every now and then after you send out troops to the king to support him during battles.

                                     building sim games. Very refreshing! 
                             Neg/Pro: Spent a lot of time playing! 

Positive 5 points.  Negative 3 points.     

*****I am Very EXCITED for this game to be finished!*****

690830,65274609,76561198149558427,0,5,11435,0,4215,1683326316,"The game is early release sort of alpha, so it hasn't been finished. The basic game is tough to play, and add ons are helpful. Many online videos show a world I cannot create. With 1000 people, happiness, and buildings I can't find a way to build. 

Monastery is the highest level in church I've gotten to, and it isn't really manageable, it makes wine but warehouse, sale and what not of wine and beer are problematic. One problem is items scroll beyond the screen and can't be selected for granary or warehouse. My beer and wine markets and taverns are selling nothing. It isn't clear to me why.

Sometimes NPC's get stuck going somewhere, and even when demolition of everything in their way is done they refuse to move forward. This is a bug, but annoying. NPC's seem unable to reroute sometimes.

Happiness is almost always a problem, and often the cause of unhappiness isn't understood. For example at 90% happiness, I can't get any immigration. Why immigrants are refusing isn't explained. 

The town as it evolves doesn't seem able to spread resources far. I create the same wheat, hop, tavern, brew factory, vintner,  cotton and everything else every few areas as granary and warehouses seem unable to take stuff produce too far away. Same with woodcutting. Woodcutters won't go very far. 

Once happiness starts to decline, citizens leave, and the game is over if it can't quickly be fixed. The reasons for unhappiness can't be explored well imo. Starting is frustrating as keeping positive cash flow (mostly by markets) and keeping happiness high (mostly via housing) can be tough. Housing can also block paths, causing other issues. It isn't possible to plant a house in a specific place like virtually all other buildings. Which seems odd. 

There is no internal system to move bread and wine across the entire game. This results in markets and storage areas not far away from being unable to provide these commodities while locally they are full. Beer and wine are hard to get into warehouse and granary, stuff at the bottom of the list will scroll off the screen, particularly if add ons are installed which add to the item list. The menu to select items to store in a granary or warehouse should not be a single non-scrollable bar doing off the screen. Automatic movement of surplus from one warehouse or granary should be possible either by default or enabled if desired, even if it costs more people or takes time to carry a few resources at a time. That is in game commerce between sections should exist and be somewhat automated. 

The game is very appealing, and is pleasurable. I have yet to have a successful military mission. Even ""very easy"" missions are rated impossible even though my troops are all ""fully trained"" and I have imported swords. 

Resources and buildings aren't ordered by function or alphabetically. Which means say searching for wheat farm can result in it being far up from the bottom of the list, and bread factory may be near the bottom of the same list. We can organize population by name, arrival, job or other aspects of their status, but not buildings or resources stored in buildings. Populations can be scrolled but not resources stored. This can get very annoying.

Making replications of the same thing over and over is annoying. Playing vanilla is just torture as the kings tax eventually destroys my ability to expand beyond about 8 or so tiles and 100 population before gold becomes impossible to keep positive and unhappiness goes wild. Rapid swings in happiness, and rapid desertion of unhappy citizens is annoying. I can set immigration IN on or off, but can't set immigration OUT on or off. With citizens abandoning quickly over a short time and no immigration in, it often becomes impossible to recover a game. 

Add ons are almost mandatory to really enjoy the same. Some side effects of some add ons have negatives which must be learned. Generally happiness and taxes are problematic, as is inability to plant housing. I want to build a neighborhood where I want, as I want, with markets and other items I want. The game treats NPC housing like reforestation, if not worse, as it requires a large area to get a single home planted. 

It is a nice alpha game, but could use some interface improvement, and needs to allow correction for unhappiness. Even when the economy is failing, where is the king who taxed me into debt and failure to bail out his local representative? One would think losing a city state due to over taxation would upset a king.

Some things like banking aren't really well explained in game, also studying to make new buildings seems limited. It is addicting and fun, but also frustrating. I look forward to improvements in game play over time.",1584545212,1584545212,True,50,1,0.764080405235290527,0,True,False,True

Difficulty comes in the form of satisfying every one of your villagers, if a handful of them leaves they can seriously mess up your city's production and economy, It will be a domino effect from there and can be hard to recover, you're just better off just starting from scratch again.

Once you reach 100+ villagers your town gets unmanageable. Your villagers will never have enough food and clothes for them to be happy. Them being unhappy means they will keep leaving your village, which brings a wide variety of problems with it, one of which you will have to employ a random villager, who will have to spend 2 hours walking to his working area where he will make 1 stone followed by another resting period, completely messing up your supply chains.
Villagers will be named ""Male #1474"" or ""Woman #1741"" instead of Wilmund or Sophie.
Selling your goods does not work. 300+ clothes in my warehouses and not one was sold in 5 months ingame time.

It has a pleasantly relaxing atmosphere and game style. Building my first lumberjacks and stonecutters immediately reminded me of my first hours with “The Settlers” - back in the day when that series was still great and enjoyable.

I think this game truly is a rough diamond with lots of potential.

Unfortunately, in its current state the game is still a little bit too rough for me… The UI is horrible, hotkeys are more or less non-existent, and the tutorial is more confusing than helpful.

Why do I still recommend this game?

Because the atmosphere is already excellent, and I can see myself having many hours of fun with this game – as soon as it has been polished enough.

Therefore, I won’t refund the game but keep it in my library to support the developers.

After giving the game ample time to convince me (well over 100 hours clocked), I feel it's time to give some kind of cautionary advice to any City-builder fan looking for a fix. Let's start at the beginning...

[h1] Foundation is not really a game... [/h1]

...But a graphical engine that allows you to play around with stuff, it is basically a very barebone ""sandbox universe"" set in a world that looks like Middle ages. Yeah I admit, this may be pretty fun and i could i really be into that if it was nicely done. It is not

Playing foundation i can't help feeling that the Devs had the interesting  idea of a gridless city builder where villagers would build their own houses yet absolutely no clue how to build on that. So yes you can build a castle or a monastery pretty much anywhere on the map and that's about it.

The ""city builder"" elements would have been deemed basic in the nineties. It feels like they exist just because building a large castle on a mountain would not have been enough to make a real game. So you need stone and planks. So let's put that into the game. And while we are at it let s add some stuff to produce food, like a wheat-mill-bakery production chain. If you ever played an Anno game imagine whatever constituted the first two level of civilisation and you got it. you got it all. Actually you may even have been a little too far.

The game offers you no indication whatsoever about your production. You get to know how much of X or Y you have and that's it ! Want to know how much stone you are accruing ? Want to know how efficently your bakeries run ? Want an approximation of your current population consumption of this or that ?
How about you shut the fuck up and go build a pretty Castle on this here mountain !? Look you have plenty of stone and treasury is bulging with gold, time to fill some towers with gold Scrooge Mc Duck !

Yeah, don't overthink it man. Build stuff. A hundred wretched villagers and a few farms will net you enough gold to fill entire pyramids... Heeeeey, that s an idea. We could let people build pyramids wherever they want ! Here comes the next patch !

Foundation is a demo for a 3D engine that has been somehow fleshed out with the most basic city building elements you have seen in decades so they would be able to call it a game and sell it for 10 bucks on Steam...

Wait, it costs 30 bucks...

I love how fluid the process is, and how developers have improved the game during it's first year! This game is a real good add to your game library, if you love city builders.

Just like in any game of this genre, you place buildings down and dream of your sprawling city as you fight the economy and resources. I personally don't know, if you can ""lose"" in this game, as I've been able to keep my population happy and bank vaults full if not with coin, pride and lies. Your people will leave you city though, if you fail to keep them happy, so I guess that is one mechanic towards losing. But not hardcore by any means.

You decide where you build, lets say granary or a hunter's camp, but with housing you actually just ""paint zones"" and then AI does the rest. This way the look of your city becomes organic and natural, just like marketed. Same mechanics apply to roads, which are formed based on how AI moves around. You can make changes to this by simply blocking off a path with something, or painting it as ""forbidden zone"".
- Worthy highlighting are ""monuments"", which you sketch out part by part and then hit that Start Construction -button. This is where real fun is, and you really get lot of freedom with it (as I see it, this part of the game has improved A LOT during first year of being out).

I don't want to go into detail about economy, as learning that is part of the good experience. But I think it is well designed, and interesting. Figuring out placement of markets, what they sell and so on, feels great and is fun challenge as well.

Game comes with five different maps, and modding community is already providing thrice of that (lot of good looking maps there). I think this game has immense potential, and highly recommend trying it out. Join developer's Discord to stay up to date with their ideas, you also get decent tips from other players, if you feel you don't understand some part of the game.

User interface is bit clunky, but I am glad they are re-designing it. They already made changes, and seem to be for better quality of life.

Go for it! Also, glory for my city of Montappen!",1583080871,1583080871,True,11,1,0.65345078706741333,0,True,False,True

I was loving every minute of it up until I reached 140 villagers and decided to try to build my first big city. Mind you, my computer can handle intense games, so this is probably a RAM issue. Specs: i7-6700k, 16GB, R9 Fury.
The game slowed down to 2 FPS and stayed that way. It was unbearable to go on at that point, so I sadly returned to other games. I hope this sort of thing gets optimized, otherwise I'm gonna have to upgrade PCs for this game. As of right now, expect to be able to build a small town with a church and a manor, but if you try to make anything major, expect the game to crawl to a slow 2 FPS nightmare. 

As an aside, my computer was not struggling, the game simply broke.

At first glance, Foundation looks like a zillion other mediaeval city builders. A different art style to, say, Banished, and it does look gorgeous, but not much different. Look deeper, however, and it's fundamentally different in gameplay.

Most obviously, it's feudal: although there's a temptation to promote everyone to citizenship as fast as possible, that's a good way to collapse your village's economy and have everyone unhappy and starving. Keep serfs toiling away as serfs forever if they produce food, and you're more likely to succeed. Imagine there's a bloody revolution in the future where the workers are enfranchised and then play.

More subtly, the organic placement of buildings and gridless system has a concrete effect on [i]how[/I] the game plays. There is no optimal size of a field, nor ratio of miners to weaponsmiths and coal burners. They all depend on how far their workers' homes are, and how long it takes them to walk to the nearest market, well or church. This makes it impossible to just look proportions up on a wiki and plan accordingly, instead the game requires you to pay attention to your workers' behaviour and optimise life for them. Making your village more efficient is equivalent to making your villagers' work-life balance better.

The game also emphasises creativity over restrictions when it comes to building. As long as your villagers can access a building's entrances, you can clip things as much as you like, hiding one functional building inside another if you want. Some people don't like it, but I do.

It's Early Access, and that shows: the core gameplay is there, but there are a few things missing. Right now, the UI is horrid, but the developers are sensibly doing other gameplay stuff rather than wasting time on a UI that is going to change. Some might want to wait for further developments, particularly if vision is an issue.

One thing I'd very much like fixed is that all the villagers are pasty white. It doesn't reflect mediaeval Europe, doesn't allow for the many non-white villages that existed, and doesn't reflect the audience of the game.",1582033390,1582329006,True,15,0,0.543979287147521973,0,True,False,True

Great game and only getting better. Devs are frequently patching and improving the game. The discord community is very active. Lots of mods being fleshed.

I recommend this game in the current state but there is one bug that really bothers me. The farmers bug out on high-pop games(500+) and this limits creativity and map choice. Devs are aware of it.",1550095708,1582182507,True,2,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,True

It is a medieval city building game with a focus on designing a beautiful environment with working construction chains. There is little challenge when compared to other games that have base building. You don't struggle that hard to survive, you don't have to build an army to conquer the world.
This is just a beautiful game that lets you build a town, idle, relax.
There is little time pressure to do anything. So enjoy.

It is also not a game that lets you overly obsess about the buildings or environment design like theme park games. It has a small variety of crafting options and that's fine.

For the current price it is a little expensive I think, The state of the game is promising though and I think it will be worth the money in the longer run. If you don't mind playing a game that lets you see variables and some minor graphic glitches, and especially if you can't wait for release and want to support a game, then I recommend you buy it.",1582137409,1582137409,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It costs 500 gold and the settlement starts with 400... That was the end of that run, and I really don't feel like starting another.

Also, villagers aren't really independent agents that pick up needed jobs and live their own lives, they're just units you have to manually assign. The quips on the steam page promised organic growth when it comes to town building.

Devs are updating it all the time, and it's charming and fun, and not depressing and muddy like many ""gritty"" medieval games go for.  There is some balancing to do and the UI needs some help because it's not terribly intuitive, but the gameplay is solid. The bright colors, cheery music, and cartoony aesthetic of the game make it mostly relaxing to play.

I'm a big fan of the gridless sytem and the way you can clip buildings inside of one another and they remain functional.

I love the real feudal style this game has. You are lord of your city and you promote your people from newcomer to serf to commoner to citizen, and only certain people will do certain things and require certain things. 

The animations are ridiculously cute, and the modding community is top notch. 

I'm happy to have found the game.

Having said all that, the game is in early access, and there are some features it really needs to implement and polish up.

There are no horses in the game, no carts for your warehouses, not a wheel or donkey in sight! Everyone just carries boxes everywhere. I hope we get more advanced methods of transport.

I want to be able to rename every single warehouse and granary because it's hard to tell what's what after you get more than 3 or 4 granaries going. Right now I can name my keep, my city, my markets.

Resources do not deplete, except for trees. Your guys can mine stone at one place for ever, apparently. Berries techincally deplete but you can have 6 workers on a berry patch and it never empties a single bush.  Resource depletion NEEDS to be a thing.

The menus are unintuitive and in many cases garishly ugly. The UI needs some adjustments to make menus more informative and user friendly and just useful in general.

I want my soldiers to fight on my land! I want to protect my people from invaders. Alas, so far they just walk off the edge of the map and your campaigns are waged in pop up text windows (which ALSO are unintuitive). The whole military system needs just a little love to make it really immersive.

you can promote your villagers, but the game is not terribly clear on what promoting them ""means"" for them. It's hard to tell what a commoner needs or a citizen until they start complaining about it. IT's also hard to tell which jobs you should and should not promote people in. For example, I found it's not great to promote people to commoner who are in jobs where they have to travel a lot, including builders and transporters. So those guys stay serfs.

There are no seasons for crops. They just keep growing and harvesting all year. The ""rainy"" season diminishes your output but not by any substantial amount if you have decent storage and other food sources. Lack of seasons in  a medieval game seems like quite the missed opportunity because medieval life revolved quite closely around the seasons. And, what are granaries for, anyway, but storing stuff through winter?

I'd like to see villagers needing firewood to keep warm.

I would like to play a possibly modded version o the game where you can focus heavily on running a non religious town. Right now, religion is an absolute requirement for villagers and they will become very unhappy very quickly without it. I'd also like to see some other architectural styles of religious buildings like Norse styles possibly.",1581738659,1581966759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I absolutely loved the gridless building system and the AI creating roads and building their own homes - it makes the world feel so much more alive than most city builders.  There is plenty of room for being creative with building large structures like castles, churches and strongholds as well.  Supply chains and population tiers will remind you of Anno 1800 in a good way.

It seems very easy at first easy enough to get 75-100 workers but going for 500 for the achievement brings issues. You have to promote the ""newcomers"" to serf then commoner then citizen with each rank requiring more input. For example basic newcomers just need berries while commoners need clothing and fish also religion and then citizens need bread and luxuries which of course takes wheat farms and windmills and bakeries and sheep farms and weavers and tailors - all the while finding room for it all and remember they like to live near their workplace....also while you grow that small church you built at the start won't hold all the new citizens they need a bigger fancier church.

-UI is a bit awkward
-There is a lack of information on the intricacy of the game, so lots of guessing how things work at this point
-Villagers seem to build in places that do not make sense ( had them build in low desirable spot in middle of buddy's wheat field, when there was plenty of average-very high room to build that was open. 
-monastery only accepts males, and must have dorms, and you cannot assign which jobs they take inside ( cannot find any info in game on this)
-church cannot assign a priest ( I promoted a guy to prier but no idea what he does )
-Army training and healing is not explained well

This game is [b]really[/b] in early access. If you're looking to see a game develop from it's early stages and follow the whole process up close, this might be for you! If that's not what you're looking for, then you're probably better off playing something else.

[b]Here is a list of issues I've had so far:[/b]

- Your villager center is a box. I don't know, I guess I was expecting a City hall or something.
- Your villagers sit around doing nothing. Yes, I assigned them, yes, I painted the extraction zone, yes, the building was finished.
- The market doesn't let you assign villagers like other buildings, so you have to manually select a villager and assign him to the market
- Wood is cut way too quickly. In a minute or 2 my entire forest was chopped and now I'm left with a lumber camp miles away from the other wood lines.
- The UI icons are really unintuitive. They just don't look like anything, you can't tell what's what.
- The ""tutorial"" quests don't give you any explanation, you have to manually go to the help menu to figure things out.
- Houses are not a building, they're just a part of your residential area. Does that mean I don't need to assign builders to make houses? Whats going on there?
- The game says your immigration level is maximum, which makes you think you just have to wait for immigrants to show up, but really you have to put down some decorations to increase desirability before they start comming. Or it was a coincidence, who knows...

Over all I think this has potential to be a really fun game one day, but for now it's more of a headache than anything, so I'm just gonna be keeping track of it and maybe re-purchase in a year or so.",1581338154,1581338240,False,2,1,0.494117647409439087,1,True,False,True

My only critique is the UI, its simple and fast but as you progress and things get alittle complicated there's no filter options for resources and it feels lacking etc, no biggie really.
if you enjoyed banished or black and white this is worth picking up.

The technology tree is profession based, and each type of storable product is part of a chain of raw materials and then finished product.  An example is a wheat farm, then a flour miller then a baker, or an iron mine > coal producer > smelter > blacksmith (for tools) weaponsmith (for weapons).

I enjoyed it very much, and I actually completed all achievements, something which I don't usually care about.

While it has elements of a typical city-building game, the concept as a whole is quite fresh.
Gridless gameplay - makes your city look and feel organic, also sorta realistic i suppose
Customization - Has good variety of customization for important structures like churches, manor, monastery, keep, market, bridges etc. The ability to create your own Unique building and add on to it in the future is very satisfying.
Chaos - NPC (villagers) actually have control authority of their own as they will decide on the orientation,type of houses and location where they want to build their houses withing the zoning u provide. This adds to the level of uncertainty where you'll never know exactly how your town would ended up look like.

I've yet to encounter any major bugs thus far. Although it's not a perfect game yet, the  ̶f̶o̶u̶n̶d̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶  basis is strong enough to add more layers onto it and i hope to see this game succeed.

Whatever, fine, ok. Then, I get a couple of hours in, and attempt to save only to find...nadah. I had to reconfigure my saves folder manually just to be able to go back to the game I had been working on.
Oh and those ""customizable"" buildings? God, GREAT concept and I wish it was better implemented, but they really don't give you a lot of variation. 
Everything done here is done better by about a dozen other games and maybe *one day* it will be good, but even for early release I couldn't deal. I really hope they improve--there's so much that could be great here.
You're going to make each market stall only carry one thing? Ok, then give me more market variants so I can build something less homogeneous without micromanaging. Allow terraforming. Make zoning matter more or *just remove it*.
