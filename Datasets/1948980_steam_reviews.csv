I won't go super into depth since i'm sure other people have already done that, and youtube videos/reviews exist, but in short; The game has a well told story with multiple branching paths and factions (sects) to choose from. Combat feels fun and engaging while not overstaying it's welcome. Leveling up and the simple skill tree system is just that, simple. It's not complicated at all and the gear for your character is your traditional borderlands style loot rarity. White - Green - blue - purple - orange. The best aspect by far this game has is its replay value. It takes a page from roguelike games where after a run you typically get some kind of points or money or currency of some kind to buy permanent upgrades to make your future runs faster and easier. This game does a similar thing. How it works is for every achievement you get, you earn points (and sometimes perks as well) and the more achieves you get, the more options you have available when making a new character. You can choose more starting perks, have higher starting base attributes, even start with some really amazing gear or martial arts. I beat the game for the first time after 3 days of playing yet i immediately started over as soon as i beat it just because i knew i had an entire new way to play and new options to pick from. There are multiple weapon choices to pick from which some factions are better suited for (Sword pavilion for example) but regardless of how you play the game, it has alot to offer. The  only real negative thing i can say is the game was originally written in Chinese, and although it has since been patched over to English (and possibly other languages?) the translation is a bit rough in some moments. Other times the insults are just genuinely funny but sometimes the grammar or information given or spoken is just straight up wrong. You'll pick to say one thing, and it will mean a completely different choice, or sometimes both choices look like they mean the exact same thing when they don't.  It won't ruin your experience or anything unless you're a grammar nazi but even then, it's still a fantastic game. Even though the game is finished, and completely playable, the devs are from what i've seen, still adding new content and bug fixes as of me writing this (2-25-24) The community seems very friendly too and there are lots of guides available if you need help on something in-game.  10/10",1708921881,1708921881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to cancel auto-battle once it starts in order to manually heal (I eventually found the option hidden in the top right corner, however it should be more prominent, and also clicking anywhere or hitting esc should also cancel the auto battle, - also the heal ability (if not the item usage) should be included in the AI). 

Also, the AI does not use the strongest abilities and instead uses attacks at random eg. some abilities do more damage if your dex/str/con/etc is higher than your opponent (you can long press on both yourself and your opponents to compare stats). Even worse, the AI misuses AOE abilities to only hit single enemies instead of 4 or more at the same time.

There is no way to turn off the Auto Battle at the start of a difficult battle before it can waste some of your long cooldown abilities.


Translation is also quite bad - it's good enough to get the gist of the story, but items/skills are very poorly worded and quite often the game uses different words to refer to things. Are Knife and Dagger both referring to the same skill? What about Sword and Blade or Spear and Long? Who knows? 

Descriptions of complex abilities that proc based on certain conditions and give unique bonuses are simply nonsensical and unfathomable without a guide, as are the ""riddles"" in the game throughout the various cities.

Occasionally there are also chinese characters present in the english translation.
The game is still fun, but desperately needs a UX / Translation overhaul.

[update: as advised by another player, knife actually refers to ""blade"" weapons which only have a single cutting edge such as sabers and katanas and does not include daggers which fall under the ""short"" category. blade is still sometimes mistranslated as sword even though sword is a separate category. There is even a legendary bladed weapon which states it's ability only works when a sword is equipped (they mean blade)]

p/s: I am typing this review while my character is stuck in an hour long auto battle.

Problems with combat system:
1. Damage reflection. If you hit a weak enemy (low defense) and does loads of damage, you can die from the reflected damage. This is just WRONG. It is an affront to WuXia lore.
- 武侠迷不能理解为什么张无忌打小虾米被自己震死。要反震至少内力也要比攻击方高好吧。醋哥，你太令我失望了。

2. When two defensively build character fight, it can end in a stalemate or hour long drag out fight. This is especially apparent with the monk boss npc - which takes forever to kill and the developers find it a good idea to give it ultra long health bar.  I lowered the difficulty to fight him and notice I simple cannot hit him hard or I would kill myself, so this monk is simply designed to waste your time.

There are many other plain stupid combat design choices that violates all WuXia lore... very frustrating. The difficulty is based on frustrating the player with hour long fights.

ps: I have no gotten all the achievements only about 67%, maybe when I have enough achievement points, this will improve.

This is by far the best Wuxia game I have played and has given me great satisfaction. I've played 6 times so far and only have 8 endings out of 14-16 I believe, the options to join different Sect's, to play out the game the way you want to, give's this almost endless ways to role-play. I am glad this game gave me similar satisfaction as Jade Empire does and I look forward to future games.
I enjoy the Outfits you get for joining different factions, 

The BAD:
 The thing I think bothers me is the beginning of the game, not having multiple starting scenarios and or locations limits the immersion for me and the limitations on monsters and wild areas is a shame. If given the chance I believe there is great Potential. 
Also the Customization for Character appearance is extremely underwhelming and its a shame because it can make the immersion so much better if there was more Options for the appearance at the start. 

it is a true shame you do not get different outfits for different ranks within the faction you join, it truly limits the immersion. 

I still recommend this game, and even though it may have some shortfalls it has many good things about the game and opens the door to more, I see the potential and hope one day it can come to light.

Attribute points, traits and abilities as well as starting items become larger as you play.
Achivements from certain choices can yield you different things, Defeating Blue wind, trait points + item, join and work/learn all their styles yields less benefits.

Also do not even try Nightmare on first playthrough you will get trashed by chickens and peasants unless you like me are a masochist for a challlange and save/load without shame, save it for later... it was....... rough.

only bad thing in this game is: 
MC seem to be a comic relife 60% of the time and a proper Wuxia Protagonist(hero)/Antagonist(villian) 40% of the time. Ruins it a bit for me, but after you leave nameless region it does get a bit less frequent at least.

No Female MC Choice: you can only be a dude, can't be female. Now for the price and share volume of content for that male choice it is only a minor thing, I hope if they make another game or even female DLC i would throw my money at them.

Getting Recipies for Crafting: This...... this is just meh..... By the time you can craft epics you got legendary.
Only cooking and Alchemy is somewhat okay. So you can easily make due with just drops and legendary loot you find.

Last advice: Stay with fist first playthrough, the Lewd master will be teaching you powerful fist arts and inner strength moves that work well with it. after the first however enjoy your favoritt style (which most likly will be short, as after a few achivements thats easy to get a new character would be much stronger from start)",1708525138,1708525188,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

The difficulty scaling is pretty absurd, and the game makes finding even basic items a chore. That said, These are all things that can be improved, and likely will over time. And it's perfectly playable, just more frustrating than it should be.

Long Answer:
1) The English translation is the biggest issue. There is a lot the game tells you that is explicitly incorrect- things like what carries over between save files, or what stats even do.
    For the most part, you'll be able to work it out with a little bit of trial and error, but it's a pretty significant barrier to understanding what the game intends.
    That said, a lot of the puzzles in this game are *very* reliant on quirks of the original language (Chinese?), to the point where the translation is completely unintelligible and you're better off hitting random options and keeping track of which ones succeeded. This part is never fun and just frustrating, and there's easily 100+ individual puzzles based on this.

2) The difficulty scaling is absurd. You will either one shot everything, or be one-shot, and there is basically never any in-between, especially as you get later into the game. And if you've started falling behind the power curve, you've basically got to go back to the beginning (and engage with the admittedly pretty neat advancing character creator)

3) The *grinding* in this game is absolutely insane, and no- I don't mean for combat. I mean for everything non-combat related, you're stuck spending easily a dozen hours each crafting/gathering materials that are completely useless to you in order to... well. At my current point of experience, do nothing. I haven't come across any crafting recipes except for the gathering tools, which are useless without being able to... you know... make anything.
     I'm also writing this review on the back of abandoning a save that got one of the gathering skills to max, and that the game *explicitly* tells you that it will carry to another save, only to find out that it doesn't and that I'm dumb for even trying.

Positives: The game is a decent experience in the early game, it just completely falls off after the first 10-ish hours.

If that sounds like your bag, go for it. If it doesn't, at the minimum wait until the translation gets better, or until mods come out to fix a lot of the issues.",1708493099,1708493099,False,1,0,0.511494219303131104,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Roleplaying potential, Branching Factions, Branching Sects, Character traits (Wisdom,Courage,etc)
- Extremely Huge amount of content and hidden quests (Some are time sensitive and faction or sect sensitive)
- Huge array of recruitable Npcs and pets to serve as your companion in battle. They can also give stat boosts in player housing
- Great amount of combat customization (Builds, Combat skills, passives , skill tree, Weapons, Consumable items,
 non-combat-skills like crafting,stealing,speech)
- Some amount of progression carries into NG+ / Next playthrough to make it easier such as legendary tier equipment , skills(Through player housing), recipes and character traits
-Modability (Tho wished there were some mods in english)

Neutral:
- Easy to effed up the run or recruit certain npcs if playing unguided. If Npcs can be perma-death following certain events.
- Bulk of the strategy is the character stat, build planning and encounter planning
- Somewhat grindy


Cons:
- Unpolished UI (Example: Text too long to fit onto screen, Inventory management)
- Not a big of fan the timed auction and auction system
- Lack of camera control, Sometimes UI cover the tiles in combat in a small room
- Some Translations issues (Still serviceable though). The riddles and couplets (Something like idioms?) were main offenders as they it does not translate well to English.
- Some frame drops in cities (Could be just my PC)

The reason I'm not recommending it are it's balance issues.
I did a lot of grinding in my playthrough. I optimized my stats and skills to combo well and I was able to destroy most enemies solo.
However, there are some encounters that even when you out level the enemy, it feels like you're doing zero damage to the opponent... While they kill you in one or two hits.
This makes no sense since the spikes are so sudden. You go from owning every fight to being one hit killed.
At first I though it was an issue of me being under leveled and so I spent a while just grinding levels, but it doesn't help.
Unfortunately I don't know how to examine enemies stats to figure out why they just destroy me so easily. Maybe I'm missing some part of the math involved... Either way it's a problem.",1708401843,1708401843,False,3,0,0.551724135875701904,0,True,False,False

I have searched everywhere since then for a modern version of that game and I am thrilled that I have found it. The open world is amazing, full of quests and things to do. Plenty of loot to be found around the place, so many people to befriend, trade with and learn from. Many sects and so many types of martial arts moves to master allows you to really customize your hero and his skills. I only played for about 10 hours and have barely scratched the surface. I love the freedom and ability to pretty much sculpt your adventure however you want, pretty much at your own speed. The wuxia world is one that I remember affectionately from my childhood and I love how this game nailed the atmosphere and environment. Every character is interesting, even the NPCS are full of personality. Your choices really matter. Do you side with the rich and powerful to gain wealth and power, or do you help the common man with benevolence? I am seriously just floored that this game checks so many of my boxes and I am so excited I found it.

You really feel the consequences of your actions and who you choose to be nice to and who you fight with. Character customization is really interesting, but a little confusing. There's a lot of little stats here and there that will determine what you can do and how effective you are at things, but its not very clear about how to find that until its probably too late. Your first character is going to be a throw away most likely. Just because it's not clear on how stats affect your weapons. But once you get into it and figure out how things work, its really rewarding and fun. It's like Final Fantasy Tactics meets Kung Fu Hustle. 

Pros: 
-Character Customization- Fun and theres lots of options for your build
-Setting is really cute and art makes it really fun. It's not too serious
-Side Quests- Theres a lot of them and they happen randomly and make the world feel full
-TCombat Transitions - Transitions between modes is smooth. You'll easily go from walking around into combat. Or you can go into stealth and you can see the enemies line of sight. You can also see what enemies are close but not close enough to be actively engaging.

The game feels like they LOVED making this. You can just tell that they really cared about the world building and making you feel like someone who starts out making ripples and turning them into big waves at the end. 

Cons: 
-Damage makes very little sense sometimes. For the most part, you'll understand if something says 150 power it will do more than something that says 30 power. But the fact that there is so many numbers being calculated behind the scenes that you don't REALLY know how much damage you do until you get into combat. 
-Level ambushes. That's what im calling these random encounters or just these events that have GIANT spikes in difficulty. And they're in normal places in the story. Like the Tiger Escort questline. 4-5 escorts in and theres a scripted event with a fight at the base. My entire party has been steadily improving and was around level 28. These guys were in the 50s! 
-The pacing seems a little off. It feels like it wants to move VERY slow. But also seems to rush you getting things like levels and money. Especially if you'll get a game over cuz some dude got bullied by random level 50 ruffians. 
PLEASE INCLUDE QUEST LEVELS IN JOURNAL! IT'D SAVE ME A LOT OF GAME OVERS! PLEEEASEEE!!!
-Inflation has hit the digital gaming world too it seems. Everybody once you leave the first village is going to want silver scraps. And a lot of them. Not just one here and there. I'm talking TEN! Unless you have a relationship with them already, which you wont. 
-Translation still needs work. I can tell people put a LOT of work into it and i appreciate it. But the quizzes and other trivia/text based events are sooo much more difficult than they need to be. One just said 'two big one small'...that was the riddle...and I got penalized for getting the answer wrong.

I know I seem to be focused on the negatives, but overall this game is fantastic and I plan to play it more because I can tell new games will only be better and easier since they handle it like PillarsOfEternity2, where achievements earn you points to spend on new playthrough buffs. To me it's a game where we are lucky to get a version to play here in America and I'm happy to support games like this. I hope the developers see reviews like these where we DO LOVE the game. And hopefully help advise on QOL improvements.

Factions, recruitable characters, pets and martial techniques really set the drive to explore the different locations full of quests/scenes and other secrets and grinding activities (fishing, gathering, crafting are all click to do, no mini-games).

Day and night cycle adds a good amount of immersion (NPCs do have schedules).
The party management is pretty simple and yet feels quite natural: eat once in a while and sleep when needed to keep everyone in shape.

Character customization is pretty cool as well:
 Learn techniques through books that go from a single target melee attack to support or even ultimates that can vaporize a full party.
 Get points to spend on your main attributes and your elemental classes to get passive bonuses.
 Gear up: Weapon, armor, artefact slots allow for enough head scratching when deciding who gets what (i have 6 party members including a chiken ^^).

Combat is pretty fun during group fights but not really interesting during the many duels which lack any tactical options. Weapon type also play a huge role in the way you play your units during combat as they offer different attack patterns and buffs.

Music, sound effects and visuals really strike true here, it's a delight to walk around new locations or watch the combat animations.

A few more important points:
Fully playable with mouse.
Speed setting for combat and even auto-fight (that i didn't test much).",1708205360,1708205997,True,6,0,0.591619431972503662,0,True,False,False

The cultivator taking his order gave a derisive snort, but Meng Hao did not really care, because he had repressed his aura down to the Single Patty Realm, and a fool would not be able to tell his true level of burger eating.

""Give me... a Happy Meal!""

The cultivator's face flickered before he finally regained his composure and laughed. ""You couldn't afford a Happy Meal. Get lost! Don't you see that there are Double Quarter Pounder Realm eaters waiting behind you?""

Meng Hao slapped his bag of holding and threw 80 billion spirit McDonald's coupons onto the counter, causing an earthquake which demolished half of the restaurant. Everyone dropped their jaws. None could see how this was possible!

""I'll take that Happy Meal with a side order of fries, "" Meng Hao said. He was as calm as the ocean in a painting of an insanely calm ocean. ""And let me see your manager!""

The cashier cultivator coughed up a mouthful of ketchup. He simply could not handle Meng Hao's killing intent, because he was only at the Quarter Pounder with Cheese realm himself. Even though Meng Hao had suppressed his aura, because he had cultivated the Heavenly Burgin' Qi, this was enough to kill people a few levels higher if he truly wanted.

It was then that another man which a much more fierce aura stepped forward. ""You dare make trouble here?""

""P... Patriarch Hamburglar!""

Patriarch Hamburglar was 99 cents of the way into the Big Mac Realm, plus tax! Meng Hao was pushed back two feet, knocking over a soda machine. Powerade Mountain Berry Blast geysered outward, killing several onlookers.

Of course, Mayor McCheese saw all this happen through the window.

Meng Hao coughed up a mouthful of blood, snorted, constricted his pupils, and then his expression went calm. He unleashed the aura of 64 patties, condensed down to a 2 patty stack that could fit into his mouth!

Mayor McCheese coughed up a mouthful of cheese. His pupils constricted.

""Is this... Seeking the McRib stage??""

Meng Hao had the gentle air of a scholar, but it wouldn't stop him from killing several people in a McDonald's.

""Burger Devouring Scripture! I'm Lovin' It!""

With the first keyword of the Burger Devouring Scripture, everyone below the early Quarter Pounder With Cheese stage exploded into purple mist. The light of the immense heavenly burger shone down with the contours of a golden arch as 9 illusory burgers floated around Meng Hao's body, which is probably an important xianxia number that matches the number of lakes in some sacred Chinese province I've never heard of. But that was only a fraction of Meng Hao's power. He waved his arm, bringing forth thirty more cultivation techniques that hadn't appeared in over 400 chapters!

""Heavenly Tribulation Fries! Eastern Everburning Egg McMuffin! Fruit Smoothie Guillotine! Soul McCafe Mocha Incarnation!""

Meng Hao's expression was the same as ever as he slapped his bag of holding, and brought out his karmic ketchup packet, Fry Cook Lord medallion, seventeen different wooden time spatulas, a five-coloured resurrection coupon, the silk burger wrapper, various souls of lightning McNuggets that he may or may not still have, and his mask of the legacy of Ronald McDonald. Oh, and the image of a flying Chicken Snack Wrap dragon appeared. Remember that? It was basically his Main Thing at the start of the novel, but quietly faded into irrelevance. Until now!

All of this takes some time to describe, but actually happened in the space of only a few breaths.

""What! Impossible!""

Meng Hao wanted to summon the parrot as well, but it was too overcome with eroticism by the purple fur depicted on a nearby poster of Grimace, and was busy drilling out a glory hole straight through the poster, and the wall it was pinned to, with its strong parrot erection.

But it was more than enough. The Hamburglar's soul flew out and was absorbed into his mask! He screamed as his body was destroyed completely.

Meng Hao brushed off his robe and swept up his spirit coupons and everyone's bags of holding which probably didn't have any cool sh*t inside unless I write him into a corner later, and anyways, don't worry about it for now. He surveyed the rubble that was all that remained of the McDonald's.

Others have noted the quality of the translation - it's pretty abysmal in places. If you have experience reading roughly translated wuxia novels you'll be okay for the storyline, but will likely still need a guide(there are good ones on Steam) for the mechanics. Two of the starter weapons are both named ""Sword"", for instance, although one is intended to be a short sword and the other something else. There are inconsistencies in the translation as well, so sometimes something will be called a ""Blade"" and a ""Sword"" in different abilities - it can be difficult to tell whether an ability will boost the right equipment. Spear is sometimes called Long, things like that.

Gameplay wise, there's a decent amount of complexity in terms of character builds. The game encourages you to try different things and take on tasks greater than you can handle. There are many ways to die and many paths to take. Restarting is encouraged, as your next character will have more skillpoints starting out.
It plays a bit like a highly polished flash game - there's something addictive about the interactivity of the environment, the crafting, the wide array of skills and abilities. There are many characters and I get the feeling that you can recruit an absurdly high number of them to join your party to beat up boars in the forest for an hour.",1707591347,1707591347,True,16,0,0.692414939403533936,0,True,False,False

- Follows Wuxia philosophy of backing your words with swords. Majority of the encounters will be fighting.
- Multiple routes, factions, skills and endings means that there's a variety of content to explore. Replay value is there because you get achievement points that you can use to get a better start, making some content that you were previously too weak to do, achievable.
- Combat is straightforward, have bigger number than opponent, be it atk and defense or maneuverability for kiting. Which makes combat quick for mooks or a war of attrition of named characters. Sometimes there are failure paths so don't get hung up about losing unless you die. Just reincarnate or rewind like a proper Wuxia protag.
- Skills and Crafting is simple, just have the recipe, the ingredients and grind to the next level.
- Relationships are very simple, just give ""gift they like"" to the character.
- Homebase exists as a feature to make future playthroughs easier. This game incentives you to replay this game.
- No item weights or inventory limits, which is a plus in my book.
- Beware of named beggars.",1705692441,1705692441,True,47,4,0.804884493350982666,0,True,False,False

A few problems though.
1) English translation is ok. There were times were the dialogue just ""/n"" and nothing more, so i understood nothing because there was nothing to understand. literally it was just /n

2) The UI was made for chinese and chinese only. its pretty clear. so if you use the english translation, the UI will feel clunky. Sometimes popups would pop up outside the screen so you wouldnt be able to read them.
3) camphor wood as a common good is ridiculously hard to get. Theres only two types of trees that can drop camphor wood and both trees only exist  in certain areas. camphor wood is a common good. the problem is trees drop leaves and barks which are useless, with barks completely replacing caphor wood. so if a tree drops bark, it wont drop wood.

my suggestion, remove the leaves and barks, why would people collect leaves in the first place?

4) battle maps, sometime just annoying. especially small battle maps and the enemies are at the bottom edge. what happens is that the icons for abilities will cover up the enemies so you'll have to maneuver your mouse

The rule of Wuxia is thus: the more beautiful and waif-like the man, the more likely he is to punch a hole through you from across the room. This game is actually pretty low on androgynous supermen, but the ones that are there will indeed still kick your ass. 

Power-scaling and degree-of-femininity are irrevocably linked in all the chinese fantasy I've consumed and I find that both hilarious and kind of cool.

There are several perks that reward you for staying away from women. There are no perks that reward you for staying away from the pretty men. The female characters are universally scaled lower than their male counterparts, and they have shorter questlines with less dialogue. 

At one point, all your female companions get spirited away to an island and your MC responds like ""oh no! anyways"" and the game goes on without them. Amazing. Tragic. Deeply sexist. Hilarious.

1. Music is on a quick bland loop and could use work

Positives:
- Allies are Diverse, From the Beggar to a Man Dressed as a bird. With well over 30 different Allies and animals to recruit(There is a playthrough you can get all but 2 of them)
- All unique NPC are actually Unique in personality and playstyle for companions
- Replay-ability through multple factions and ALOT of endings, 7 ""True Endings"", 1 Complex Ending. Not to mention ones like dieing to poison or being killed by a chicken
- NO Fetch quest or filler missions
- Diverse playstyles for the main character, plus unique outfits
- Solid English translation that also holds it back in many areas
- Very open sandbox that allows you to wonder throughout the whole game if wanted
- All in one experience, no Expansion... for the price you get everything... for $20 or less looking at 40+hours of entertainment
- Self managed new Game plus mechanic with the homestead, Carry 10 items, 5 abilities and all base progress.
- Achievements matter to unlock more powerful playthroughs, So a rogue like mechanic


Negitives:
- Limited companion customization (outside of armor and weapon)
- Unclear quest markers... well no quest markers...
- A min- max build Simulator, To beat Most endings you have to master the Many Stats
- Too many companions... By the end most are not used at all.
- Companion relationships are there but shallow at best... no real interaction or words except at the occasional junction
- Ending combat section is a massive increase in difficulty and ends rather anti-climatic
- Too Much... Endings, items to find, Endings, Stats, grinding, Systems... After 40 hours still had ALOT left to discover.
- English translation is pretty good, the crew seems to lean towards ""Litteral"" over ""intention"" Translation. Several Scenes and Words are not translated
- Unique outfits for the PC that dont carry over to new playthroughs
- No clear class system or rolls. 
- Limited Carry over for time investment in each playthrough
- Mods difficult to navigate.
- No Achievement for Complex ending
- 

In conclusion, Hero's Adventure is a worthwhile investment for any TRPG fan, Offers multiple endings, satisfying Companions and choices, a challenging difficulty curve even on Easy and Normal if your not familiar with mechanics, with a Complex ""true Ending"".

I want to point out that not knowing things on your first play through is not a bug but rather a feature. The game is meant to be played several times. You can fight, steal, assassinate make angry, make friends, bribe etc. any NPC in the game. So make stupid choices get stupid outcomes. Also as a key feature achievements will enable more stat points, better starting gear, better and more perks when you restart your game. Mind you some of the perks even change how the NPCs react, how the quests go and even enable some endings. You have a home base which can be enabled to have all its upgrades be through different play-through's.

So yeah the game is solid in the start but gets even better later.

And there are just so many different plots, jokes and things, which are just so fun to find. All I can say be creative and the game will reward you for it, read the flavor texts and try things. 

Once you have played the game through a couple of times, you will notice that since most of the things can be done in any order possible. Your previous quests and NPC relationships matter, and more importantly the relationships of NPCs matter, because different quests will change those too. 

Translation is better than other games of the same genre. 
Jokes are fun.
Complete freedom.
The game is loaded with content.
The world feels alive and reactive to your choices.
Price to quality ratio is a complete steal from the buyers side.

Overall if you enjoy the wuxia genre and rpg gaming, buy this game.",1704404093,1704405631,True,1,0,0.503875970840454102,0,True,False,False

It's a fairly extensive game with lots to do and find at least; lots of sects and other factions to join, characters to befriend, recruit or defeat, ladies to woo, regions to explore, techniques to find and learn, resources to obtain, epic weapons to pick up and of course, secrets, easter eggs and many endings to uncover and so on and on... With five difficulty levels, it's also up to the player exactly how hard or easy they want their journey to be, as such. 

The game also has several achievements and while this is hardly uncommon in games nowadays, they impact the game in a way that is a bit unusual: during character creation, you can select certain traits, skills and the like for your character, but they cost points and the first time around you won't have that many of those. But after a playthrough, you will almost certainly have unlocked at least a few achievements with each such being worth a certain amount of points and thus obtained some more points that can be used to give your next character a few advantages for that particular playthrough. The game's not all perfect though. For me, the points of criticism, or things I'd remark upon anyway, are these:

1. I feel that defeated animals/other mooks respawn a bit too quickly - you've hardly cleared an area out before all the animals or whatever are back. More time should pass before they spawn, IMO.

2. As of the writting of this review at least, craftingwise, I feel that there are too few recipes in the game and that they're in general rather hard to find. Now, I wouldn't find this odd in regards to the epic and legendary-tier stuff - That kind of stuff should be hard to find, but even basic recipes are like, quite hard to find? That makes no sense, those should be more readily found and available. The lack of recipes is something I find all the more kind of odd, considering how many ingredients there are of and for, well, pretty much everything in the game - food ingredients, minerals, herbs, cloths etc...

3. The directions of the quests in the journal are sometimes not as clear as I would like thme to be. For example, the instructions may say 'Go to place X', but without mentioning what prefecture or city the location is supposed to be in, leading to the player having to guess and search for where the place is...

Finally, while the translation of the game is overall good enough from what I can tell - and while I DO understand that things like poverbs and suchlike can be hard to translate, so I won't make much if any noise regarding those - there's a few lines I encountered that were just strange or whose translation was skipped altogether... Though in the later case those almost entirely happened in the Beast Manor, the newest addition to the game, so this may be a matter of errors to be fixed in later updates...

I recommend the game first and foremost to those who like wuxia tales of whatever medium (books, manha/manhwa/manhua, games) like for example Tale of Wuxia (which you can find here on Steam) and RPGs in general, but especially the isometric ones such as the Baldurs Gate games, which this game resembles in some ways.

There's a lot of content in this game that goes unexplained, regardless of the translation. You have to spend energy, time, and research to understand much of the content in this game. In a way, this is like real life. You had to spend time and energy to understand the  varied nuances of real life too.

But there's a couple problems with this approach. Games aren't real life. We don't always have the time to dig into honeycomb of nooks and cranies. We play games to enjoy ourselves. At some point, the inaccessibility of content becomes a game design problem and of UI problem. Sometimes, not explaining things ends up just wasting your time.  This game would benefit from explaining more of fits content. Not everything about its skill system is explained.  How you gain experience in various skills is not explained. You have to find recipes for crafting or cooking in various nooks and crannies of the game, which is honestly a painful way to use this interesting system that you don't really have to use. The game also does a poor job of explaining to you its combat system. Internal energy is divided into Yin and Yang, and you pick one at the start of the game, but the game doesn't tell you why Yin and Yang matters at this point or maybe even ever. Additionally, I am still not entirely clear on how you raise your weapon stats using stat books and how to find those stat books.

It's a good game, which feels like it has more content than it actually has because it keeps a lot of its content secret. Yet, I am still impressed with how well thought out this game was.",1704289856,1704290458,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a good time sink if you're someone who loves to min-max characters and companions in RPG games. If you're a fan of the Wuxia genre of games, this will definitely tickle that itch. It's got all the usual suspects: martial techniques that your character can learn, sects that you have the opportunity to join as you work your way up the ranks, the ability to collect like-minded companions in your travels, and more.

Notable gameplay elements (and similar references):
- Stat-based RPG leveling where you can grind levels or train specific stats by performing specific in-world actions.
- Collect manuals that will teach certain moves to your characters (eg., HM/TM's from Pokemon games).
- Stamina/Energy system that will run out as you perform resource gathering tasks (eg., Stardew Valley).
- Turn-based battlefield action (a la, Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem).
- Relationship/romancing system (eg., Stardew Valley, Harvest Moon, and Fire Emblem).
- Neat quality of life features such as an auto-battle mode for when you want the grinding to be a little less click heavy.

Pros:
- Systems work well together and were compelling enough to keep me playing.
- You can really feel as if your character is progressing in a larger world / narrative.
- Pickup and put down pretty easily.
- Playthroughs will unlock additional attributes to improve your next attempt through the game.
- Quick save/Quick load feature makes it easy to grind out battles on the overworld.

Cons:
- Hard to know what you should ""do"" in the early-to-mid game. Narrative plot pushes you to follow a particular quest line in your first run that helps to keep guardrails on this but it doesn't adequately explain the importance of your stats and attributes. (Recommendation: Use a character building guide for your first run, just to learn the game, and take mistakes as they come).
- Lots of invisible enemy encounter flags/scaling that will surprise you on your first run through a particular area.
- Levels don't really matter much: your raw stats and learned techniques are more important. I've been defeated by lower-level ""boss"" characters that simply had higher raw starts.
- Some language blockers / ambiguity. Some puzzles are unsolvable in English due to the loss of meaning during the translation. Please refer to a guide for these - it is a minor inconvenience. For context: English is my first language and this game's translation is serviceable enough. There are times when language can be an issue but there are workarounds available.

I am now around 40 h into the game, tried pretty hard to be good in this (its not a skill issue, this is roundbased fighting), but gave up finishing the game because of how buggy the gsme is. The mainquest stopped at some point, a lot of stuff was happening and i had like 3 mainquests going on and all of them vanished.

Pro:
- great game for wuxia/cultivation game fans
- the martial arts look nice
- a lot of good side kicks who are recruiteable (not everyone, named npcs only)
- game has a achievement system, so you could restart a newgame and get more op traits
- auto battle, thank god for auto battle with 4x speed, that was a real lifesaver

Cons;
- game is buggy, sometimes the game doesnt accept commands or buys wrong items (in bulks)
- game is a buggy mess, has gamebreaking bugs, so the emperor is gone, who was the traitor? I was accused of treason. Meanwhile some random evil sect going nuts, but they also dissappeared ..40h in and all i feel is regret putting so much effort into this game
- the movement is bad, you can just run in lines/cubes (diagonal), feels stupid when you have to walk a long thin line and you have to move in a zigzag motion
- forging/crafting is absurdly bad, you either lack recipes or materials. I was still using green and blue rarity  (there are still purple and yellow) tools at lvl100, cuz i couldnt get enough beginner lvl wood and metal to get my crafting up to lvl2-3 
- game completly cuts you off from 6 other questlines (sects ) if you chose one of the other sects or beginner sect/master. So all you get is a ""no, we dont know you, go away please"" from the other 5-6 big factions, imagine not beeing able to access 30% of the game the whole time.
- i couldnt find a single usable legendary sword (without killing one of the sect masters). The game gives you 1x a good opportunity in a night auction to bid for like 6 legendary (gear) items, but i had like 60k and everything was above 180k and that was like at the beginning at around 10h mark, where i cheated the casino by saving and loading... so how am i supposed to buy all that? and the mission triggered by itself , i didnt even knew that there was a mission going on. there should be a warning, that auction never happened again. Its like saying to a beginner, you either buy now or never

It's an interesting RPG take on the WuXia style games where you are close to a blank-slate character and you're on a personal journey of growth and cultivation to become a powerful martial artist. The amount of paths to take in the game is both overwhelming and exciting; there are several sect paths to join and experience the game differently. 

I'd like to see: 
More quests, companion and side. There are a lot of companions to choose from, although some are very weak compared to others. I'd like to see more companion questing and maybe allowing different types of relations with each character; such as a master/disciple relationship. Maybe even stuff like establishing your own sect or becoming the head of one.

My problems: 
Very strange bugs(?) that can inhibit progress of certain missions. I am not sure if they are unintentional though; [spoiler] All 3 potential companions from the maiden house can easily be missed if you simply talk to people at the wrong times, or if certain people are on-screen. [/spoiler](There's a guide on recruiting companions, use it)
Power-scaling is almost non-existent, you'll destroy boars in the nameless forest then suddenly get one shot by a random bandit encounter, very frustrating.
All of the riddles and couplets are nigh-impossible for western audiences. (There's a guide containing the solutions to all of these, use it).

Personally I didn't find the translations to be an issue (unless you count the riddles) the exception is the ""Banish"" option, which just makes you savagely attack somebody out of nowhere.

[b]A Skeptical Start:[/b] When I first came across this game, my expectations were modest at best. The idea of diving into another title filled me with a mix of curiosity and hesitation.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]🎲 Gameplay Perception[/h2]
[i]A Surprising Turn:[/i] As I delved deeper, my initial doubts were replaced by intrigue. What I had presumed to be a [u]tedious, slow-paced turn-based affair[/u] transformed into an engaging and immersive experience that captivated me in ways I hadn't anticipated.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]👩‍💻 Creator's Dedication[/h2]
The Soul Behind the Screen: It's easy to jest about the creator having 'no real life,' perhaps lost in a world of their own creation. But, it's this very immersion and dedication that breathes life into every aspect of the game, placing it firmly in the 'no game, no life' echelon of digital artistry.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]💖 Overall Impression[/h2]
A Tip of the Hat: My respect for the creators is immense. [b][i]This isn't just a well-made game; it's a testament to their hard work and passion.[/i][/b] I eagerly await their future endeavors, hopeful that they continue to pour their heart and soul into their craft.

[spoiler]
[h2]🌲 An Unforgettable Start[/h2]
[b]A Comedic Entrance:[/b] My journey in this incredible game began with a literal fall from a tree, leading to a hilarious encounter with two quarreling girls. In a twist of fate, I ended up securing them with a rope to prevent further chaos. This unexpected start set the tone for an adventure filled with humor and unexpected turns.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]🥋 Meeting the Drunken Grandpa[/h2]
[i]A Master Like No Other:[/i] The next chapter of my escapade led me to an old, drunk grandpa beggar, who fancied himself as a master and challenged me. After a comical scuffle where I had to 'smash' him, I realized that this game was anything but ordinary.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]🐔 The Quest to be a Chicken King[/h2]
My ambition took an even more bizarre turn in the next city, where I aspired to become a 'chicken king.' Yes, you read that right. My pet chicken, trained in the art of kung fu, became either a grandmaster slayer or my dinner, depending on how our training sessions went.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]🎮 Why This Game Stands Out[/h2]
[b][i]A Blend of Absurdity and Adventure:[/i][/b] This game breaks the mold with its blend of absurd, comedic scenarios and engaging adventures. Every encounter, whether with humans or chickens, is a story in itself, filled with laughter and unexpected outcomes.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]💭 Wrapping Up My Thoughts[/h2]
In a gaming world where seriousness often takes the forefront, this game dares to be different. It's a breath of fresh air for those who seek humor intertwined with their adventures. I'm thoroughly enjoying each quirky moment and can't wait to see what other hilarious twists await.

The combat is extremely ""tactics lite"", for lack of a better term, but the battles are pretty short and snappy, making it never quite feel like a chore.  Character progression is pretty simple and intuitive as well, with a mix of external (active) and internal (passive) battle skills that level up through combat, items, and meditation.  You also can gain special traits that grant all sorts of passive bonuses via character creation and in-world achievements.  You level up via story events, combat, and meditation, and can raise your primary stats once every ten levels.  Simple stuff.

The things that stood out as exemplary, though, were how the game handles things like travel, exploration, martial and political factions, and storyline engagement.  There's an incredible amount of freedom in how you can engage with the game, and yet it has managed to ""cut away the fat"" from a lot of these pillars of play.  There is no tedium to travel, and you can easily recruit animal companions to make cross-region traversal completely a non-issue as well.  Exploration isn't an arduous experience of trying to find all of the hidden things around every nook in each stage, and each scene (and their secrets) are very intuitively laid out, or have maps and hints to guide you appropriately.  There are tons of recruitable characters and factions you can join, many with their own small storylines to pursue at your leisure.  There are dozens of endings and in-world achievements, most of which are quite easy to obtain and will reward extra player options on future plays of the game.

And even though the game is so easy to engage with and puts player agency and freedom first, the stories it tells are surprisingly varied in tone and structure and seriousness.  It's been a really engaging experience, diving into this game.  I expected a silly little martial arts tactics game, and got nearly a hundred hours of excellent wuxia short stories.

Whether aspiring to be a hero, a villain, or something entirely different the game offers a myriad of paths to explore. It doesn't hold your hand allowing you to freely wander where your heart desires. The developers promise around 80 populated cities and villages, a claim I've had no reason to doubt though I haven't finished the game yet. The world is vast and constantly buzzing with activity. Its beautifully crafted, pixel-styled depiction of China is a visual feast. I often found myself simply wandering through the cities, soaking in the sights and discovering hidden gems. During your journey you will pick up quests, recruit all sorts NPCs to your party, join various sects to help them achieve their goals or conversely destroy them. There's a whole array of techniques to master with your weapon of choice or just bare hands. Each community has its own secret techniques to teach loyal disciples, and sometimes a stranger you help might teach you his favorite move, broadening your arsenal.

At the start of the game, you have a fixed amount of points to allocate, making you a below-average warrior. As you progress and gain achievements, you earn more points for this pool, strengthening your character for future runs. This allows you to achieve certain goals earlier or best opponents who were previously unbeatable. You can execute both special and normal attacks. Special attacks consume MP, but there's plenty available, and each hit also increases your technique XP, making it more powerful. Tactical battles allow you to move back and forth as much as you like, so if you miss a spot, you can always return to it. There are bonuses for backstabbing and flanking but no retaliation from enemies allowing you to easily disengage. Later in the game you'll add ultimate moves to your arsenal making your battles even more spectacular.

True to the spirit of a typical kung-fu game, any problem can be resolved through fighting. Are guards blocking your way? Kick their asses to show them who's boss, and they will bow in acknowledgment, letting you pass. Met a new friend and want to form a closer bond? So beat him up and he will surely admire you more afterward. Got a crush on a pixelated girl? Well, you already know the drill.

The game challenges you to consider choices beyond the seemingly good or right ones, as they may not always yield the best outcomes. For instance helping two brigands in the woods attacked by wolves might seem noble increasing your benevolence but decreasing your wisdom. This principle extends to gathering skills as well: spend a lot of in-game time grinding to level up gradually, or find a more experienced character for quicker, more effective training.

It is incredibly amazing how everything you do has an effect in the game and it has so many jokes. I have discovered so many great stories, lore, hidden things in the game and many fun interactions.

Honestly this game has so much more than what it is worth.

Note that the game is still new and just released basically. Localisation is still on the way, it is not yet fully translated and you will see a couple of things that are not yet translated but most of the important things are there and with a bit of energy, you can get anywhere in the game.

The way to recruit people in your party is jut hilarious as it completely changes from the NPCs personality.

My first hour of the gameplay was as follows:

- Decided to tie the 2 people up
- Helped the constable man but turns out It was a woman
- Got then destroyed by a pervert
- A kid tricked me and stole my money
- Got told I am the weakest hero people know

Run around the provinces as a roaming martial artist or join a Sect in classic Wuxia style and rise to prominence as a new gifted disciple. A truly enjoyable experience. The translations to English can be a bit rough but isn't too bad at this point, I thank the fan community that did this for the English speaking players. As for the game, it's a great turn based strategy RPG where you fight opponents using various martial arts. The interesting thing here is skills are based on martial arts you learn instead of training with the skill. So your skill in a weapon is only as good as the training manuals you can find. Small note for new players, the old man that asks you to join him in the first town is the beginners faction. For subsequent playthroughs if you deny him then other options and events open up at that starting area.

I think the only mark against it is the quest information and faction systems would be considered rough at this point in gaming. Such as my first play through I had entered a dead state since early on I made enemies that the lead to quests never starting or being considered since the factions had already been wiped out. So after 20 hours I was left roaming the world with nothing happening to enter the next phase the story should have.

It's not a bug, it's a feature; you are IN one of those wuxia novels, including becoming absurdly OP by total accident.

In addition, there are no wrong choices. Seriously, there aren't any choices I would say are 'wrong'. I have done some weird crap in the stories, and I haven't found any soft locks in any stories, simply new stories that emerged after. And that's what the key to this game is: they are all stories. There are new ways to play. It's an anti-roguelike in which the more you play and experiment in one run, the more you succeed in the next with achievements and bonuses you earned from your prior run. And the combat system is like a cracked out final fantasy tactics/tactics ogre, it's AWESOME if that's the itch you need to scratch, and if it's not and you just like to see numbers go up, the autobattler system is impressive.

This is a sandbox rpg with some roguelike elements, and you are meant to find every method possible to cheat the game, as it's got chinese origins. It is not fair due to limitations like not having proper traits or rare gear/ability manuals... 

But. You can cheat the game. Sometimes, anyways.

The game is not fair, and what i mean is: You are never going to be prepared the first time you encounter something. 

Enter a city? Prepare to get curbstomped by some psychotic and literal edgelord samurai.

Challenge a boss? He has a phase 2. Then a phase 3 because screw you that's why.

Mind your own business exploring some forest with creatures? Run into someone, get beaten to death no matter what choice you pick, and are too weak to fight back.

Investigate some missing disappearances? Congratulations, you've just joined the list.

Level requirement to be at ""least"" level 50 to progress a quest? They clearly meant ""have the stats of a level 100 while being level 50"" to perfectly clear and survive an encounter.

This game heavily encourages save-scumming and preparation. Grind, train, farm. Shortcuts wherever you can find it are essential. Find a master, take in their teachings and treasures and beat the crap out of anything that inconveniences you.

Later on you get more tools such as poison and pickpocketing. If you want to be the best, simply poison the rest. What're they gonna do, kill you? If they've got treasures? It's yours now. 

This game loves shortcuts. Permadeath applies to all npcs. If you kill one, they're gone for good... if you're capable at least. If you can kill off every master in the land, who's going to stop you when you declare yourself number one? Everything is a means to an end. You can challenge everyone one-by-one or do it the ""moral"" way and fight them all at once with the lowest odds of succeeding without a lot of stats. You will need guides to perfectly succeed, and maybe that's intended.

Many things need trial and error to be discovered, some weapons are the most annoying to find skills and manuals for... (looking at you, daggers.), some things need literal guides to understand because if you don't know chinese then you're screwed out of a specific route to progress. Thankfully there are multiple solutions to problems in this game and that's why it's enjoyable.

However, there are some gripes.
-You can't easily be a ""bad"" guy. The game pretty much pushes you towards some benevolent hero that serves the masses even if you commit all the genocide and evil choices in the world. There's probably a very specific method to truly be ""evil"" but I haven't looked it up yet. Freedom is somewhat an illusion in that sense.

-Your companions will pretty much always be ""good"" people, I don't know of very many that are happy with ""bad"" deeds like stealing or killing innocents. Even so, if someone's relationships decreases, you can always bribe them to make them love you. Money makes everything go round in this game it seems.

-Like I said before, the game has roguelike elements. Achievements in this game unlock starting trait points and attribute trait points. The more you unlock, the more traits you're able to pick for your next ""reincarnation"" or new game. Why is this a gripe? Because you're not expected to achieve an ending on your first run. That's just the OCD completionist in me speaking. You need to lose in order to win, and grinding things in this game takes time if you don't know the ""efficient"" routes.

But overall it's worth a try, I'm still going around trying to see how things can progress differently.",1702677989,1702677989,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I was rather apprehensive, about buying this title in the first place, in lieu of the innumerable negative reviews relating to the inadequacy of the translation, but to be perfectly frank, after a few hours of play, you quickly overcome any confusion pertaining to how mechanics work. The story is certainly in keeping with expectations for Wuxia, and anyone who has watched or played any title adhering to this structure will immediately recognize it's environment. I will grant that there are some nuances to play that you may only stumble across in the later game, which will enormously benefit you in terms of tackling some of the more challenging elements of this game, oddly enough that includes leveling up crafting, but if you're moderately clever, persistent, and enjoy the genre itself, it's rather hard to go wrong with this title. 

The combat is challenging, until it's not, and then you assume it's going to be a cake walk, until it isn't, so you you surmise that you've plateaued, and there's no way to defeat certain enemies, then you have a breakthrough, possibly as much as a player scrutinizing your build and how to eek out every ounce of damage/defense as the character himself, and now that NPC is defeatable where they were seemingly invincible before. Looking at you Confucian Sect Leader (homeboy goes -hard-). 

The world is rich and vibrant, and there are a surprising number of sects and people to interact with, though admittedly some are less developed than others. Unlike wandering sword, there is less of an overarching narrative that cements your attachment to said characters, and the emphasis is more on getting what you personally want out of the game. If a sect rubs you the wrong way, wipe them out. If you adore them, join up, learn everything they have to teach you, and leave them in peace. 

The irreverent humor and overall sarcastic tone are highly enjoyable. The main character is an absolute dork, I love it. Oh, and the game is -exceptionally- stable, I haven't encountered a single bug or crash in 99 hours of play.

The one area that will infuriate you if you allow it to, translation wise, is the various Confucian citations you're asked to complete--use a guide for this, they are extant on Steam.

I'm maybe 1/3 of the way through the game, and I can't find the motivation to continue. Here are some reasons:

Story: The game does not have an underlying story propelling you along - there might be one lurking in the back, but a third of the way in, I haven't found it yet. There are a series of seemingly random vignettes instead, which does not motivate me to continue. This wouldn't be a problem if exploration or character progression was better, but they are not.

Open world exploration: the game is billed as an open world game, but it has a time system. At higher difficulties, certain enemies scale with time, which means there's a pressure to ""use your time wisely"", defeating the purpose of open world games where you should have the freedom to explore, experiment, and take risks on your own time.

Region design: the game is broken into regions, but it's difficult, if not impossible to clear one region at a time before moving to another region. This is because enemies within a region vary tremendously in power Some quests in a region require a lot of grinding to complete, but by that time many other encounters in the region become trivial and a nuisance. The whole time you are left wondering if you're using your time wisely and whether tough enemies elsewhere are scaling faster than you are. Perhaps this is the game's way of forcing you to go to other regions and then come back, but there are much better ways of doing so, like allowing you to clear a region but then designing story quests that take you back to prior regions to face stronger enemies, etc. Because traveling between regions takes time, you're torn between trying to clear a region and going to other regions and coming back, not knowing which is the most efficient use of time.

Character progression: there are a lot of attributes and skills in the game, but many don't feel relevant. For example, there are 5 identification skills that identify different giftable items. Imagine a game where if you wanted to identify a glove you had to learn the ID glove skill and if you wanted to identify a helmet you needed to skill up a separate ID helmet skill - but it's worse than that, because most of the items you are identifying can't even be used in combat - their only purpose is as gifts to NPCs, making these skills mostly nuisances that block progress rather than giving you a sense of real progression if you advance them. This is true of a lot of mechanics in the game.

Crafting: again, this is a nuisance rather than something that gives you a sense of progression. There are 5 gathering skills and 5 crafting skills, yet only a handful of things you can actually craft. You can't really fully craft your gear because there aren't enough crafting recipes. Basic crafting materials are also hard to come by, so leveling up crafting is frustrating. Crafting also doesn't really give you any advantages over simply using non-crafted items, so the whole system is quite irrelevant and again, feels like it's there to block progress than give progress.

Positives: 

[*]Its fun and the game wants you to level! If you like a good old level grind, then this is a good place
[*]Fun and addictive game play
[*]Creating a character requires decision making to optimise your play style
[*]The fighting aspect is generally fun
[*] You don't need to have companions, you can play without and gain benefits to avoid the micromanagement. 
[*] ""Auto battle"" - I love this function in these games. I like grinding. I like grinding even more with a coffee and a show on my 2nd screen, chilling on a day off work. Huge plus here on easy fights. 
[*] There is a lot in this game. Loads of things to max from crafting to poisons to cooking, Loads to do!

Negatives:

[*]People talk about ""bad translation"" and that is nonsense. Honestly, other than a few words here and there only English majors or grammar police will get annoyed. The problem lies in the lack of ""information"" given about most things like quests or even the homestead. You end up in the forums every 20 minutes trying to figure out what the heck to do.
[*]The ""tutorial sect"" which you would expect to be in and out of in a flash to join the other sects nearly requires you to be level 80+ before you can finish the quest line. Its insane. Not sure about easier modes but hard-mode + even at level 80, you struggle.
[*] The game needs a lot and I mean a lot of work. The balance on hard-mode+ is just out of whack. With level 80+ with top gear- bosses one shot you and you do literally 100 damage to them. No explanation from anywhere on how to improve this from the game help and even min/maxing doesn't help from what I know.
[*] I hate achievement grinding personally. I just want to play the game and If the achieves come - then thumbs up. This game hits whatever OCD you might have to make you grind like 130+ achievs to gain min/max builds. Either reduce this to like 30 or allow people an option to just bypass it. The game is moddable so something might come out in the future.
[*] Quests don't tell you the level of opponent you will face. You could be level 20 and walk in to meet a level 65. 

Summary:
[*] I recommend wish listing this and waiting for updates to the negatives above unless you want to play it on normal mode. Hard-mode + starts off easy and fun but in the quest battles, there will be 1 guy who literally one shots you when he is in range, There is nothing you can do.
[*] There is massive potential here, I hope the devs get it right and I can change the recommendation.",1700483145,1702059415,False,35,3,0.677831709384918213,0,True,False,False

Sure, a little Engrish will come through every now and then, but nowhere near as much as most Wuxia games which seem to have an unwritten rule that they must be impossibly complex.

There are a horde of open-world options like which factions to join, which waifu to marry (and you can marry multiple at once). And character creation is very involved and fun including loads of traits, stats, weapon types, super martial arts, and even talent trees. It's just a very complete and very fun game, though a small criticism would be that some weapon types and martial arts seem more ""complete"" than others, with more weapons and martial arts around them.

Update on review- 
few suggestions

Dlcs ADDED more weapons and new areas for expansion would be awesome - i would so buy it, be nice gambling had more then just dice games.

 finally beat the game , every game will be different ... i noticed its hard finding recipes,crafting items and making gear...not easy to find them in game - maybe add market for it or event in game and win them for crafting and cooking items ect...

when starting new game maybe mix up npcs gear and build on sec and few others so its always different 

maybe have gambling den for all animals buy and sell them- hunter class

但是真的不推荐 玩起来你会觉得很烦 不像是金庸那种满世界乱跑在哪里看到什么都兴奋地乐趣
而是步步为营走一步就要思前想后的那种油然而生的烦
具体原因
- 有个时间：这玩意虽然限制取消了，但是看这日子一天天过真的挺烦的，如果不查攻略你又不知道过了多少天是不是有什么错过了
- 八杆子打不到一起去的联系：可能在xxx做了一件什么事，然后玩了俩小时在YYY（大部分是查攻略）才看到了这件事的效应。这个为了硬核我是可以理解的，但是这个程度真的有点纯纯恶心人。不看攻略随随便便就能错过一大堆东西， 而且大部分还都是永久错过。
举个例子，玩了一半了我想开始收集甲刀了然后发现服部兵藏怎么都不触发，后来想起来了，他在城里所有的单挑我都赢了，就唯独进城的时候打不过他我就选的择日再战，然后这个甲刀就永远的错过了。大哥，我tm进城的时候是一个新兵蛋子，然后玩了快十个小时你给我来个这个是不是不太合适
- 最恶心的更新这一件事：神仙醋是什么水平我们是知道，但是你能不能把你兴趣开发那一套路数稍微改改？我确实不能说你这样的频繁更新是坏事，但是你这个正式版以后每次更新都要重做加大改，导致网上大部分的攻略你完全不知道对不对。
不知道对不对要是别的游戏随便玩玩也就罢了，偏偏跟之前说的你还总设计这种几个小时以后才发现没了的反人类设定。以现在大家玩游戏查攻略做完美的理念来说，玩着玩着除了火大真的没有别的感觉。

还是那句话，很多理念其实都是不能说是错误的，比如继承，错过，实际都是在鼓励多周目拉长游戏时长的尝试。但是设计这些新时代的东西的时候请不要忘了玩游戏归根结底是为了放松获得乐趣。而不推荐的根本原因就是：你这个游戏，既没有硬核到老头环蔚蓝那种让大家沉迷的系统，然后又不符合初版金庸那种轻松爽文的理念。玩到后期除了闹心没有任何别的实质上的感受",1701714376,1701714376,False,1,0,0.462967991828918457,0,True,False,False

By far the weakest part of the game is your companions. They are useless, specially on Nightmare mode. Get a full crew just to watch them get one hit and fall unless you spend a stupid amount of hours grinding away in the beginning area (which the xp falls sharply by time you get them to level 15) the next area is supposedly Wolf Wind Valley and again you watch your companions fall to a single hit 9/10. 

You might ask why even recruit them because they offer things. With the doctor don't really need go back to town, same with the shop(inn)keeper, hunter, talker, etc. yet by time your level 15 with 6 or 7 levels in a martial art, they are first level (Oneth in game) in their martial art, and a partial sneeze can knock them down. Which amounts to basically they hit with pillows, and fall cause someone looked at them wrong. 

though I've almost 30 hours in the game, I've not made it much past the starting area, as I'm still trying to figure out how to level up the companions for the 3 day quest where they (and myself) aren't falling to people that are level 27 (seriously?? they should be closer to level 18 or 20) much like the main girl (cold masked woman, or criminal investigation one) not 7 levels above them. even for Nightmare it's dumb to put someone with that big of a level advantage up. Can you beat it probably (I've beat the Criminal Investigation members, but not the cold masked woman and her croonies) 

So overall game is fun, grindy though (unless you beef up your intelligence even then companions don't have that high of intelligence which hinders them severely). I'd recommend playing on at most the difficulty just bellow Nightmare if you want to have people traveling with you, as it's just a pain to try to get them up enough to be useful.",1701665485,1701665485,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am playing in Chinese and getting the true value of the experience. Even if they perfect the translation, there are simply too many subtle nuances in this genre and in the Chinese language for non-speakers to fully appreciate. And I will readily admit to cheating at the poetry puzzles which no normal person who went to school in China/Taiwan/Hk will get full marks. 

My biggest gripe with this game is that I am either overpowered or am overpowering others (normal difficulty). It is rare to find an even match. You will also find yourself fast-saving a lot as you don't want to lose the game on one wrong turn or made to make a game breaking choice unprepared. There are also some issues with character relationships that seem messed up. Getting into a bad relationship with a faction due to random story encounters and then end up not being able to complete faction stories as they then attack you on sight. 

I am still having fun with the game. Just wish many things could be developed in more depth.

The setting, especially for a westerner, is unique and very cool. The implementation of the ancient Chinese culture is very interesting and enjoyable to interact with and it is pervasive across the game (as far as I can tell). So being selfish, reckless, or impolite has both direct consequences to your ""build"" but also to the story and the characters you interact with during your travels.

The reason why I compare it to Kenshi is that Hero's Adventure has consequences. The choices you make, both in actions and dialogue, have direct impact to your story. Insult someone and they may never join your party, save someone in danger will have them reward you and maybe even help you, but you may have made an active enemy of their attacker. Just great stuff.

The combat is simple, but enjoyable and progressing the character to become an awesome martial artist is truly addictive, which is the soul of Wuxia as far as I can tell. Progression or cultivation. Really reminds of Dragon Ball, which I now realize definitely is inspired by the genre. I haven't gotten there yet, but you can roleplay Goku in this game 100%.

Seems a bit more freeform than others I've looked at, since you aren't restrained by the passage of days being tied to events in the plot happening.

The English translation is fine, its a little jank but perfectly serviceable and the likes other long-time players of translated asian game would recognise and be able to deal with.
The only area it fails is in some of the dialogue puzzles which only make any sense in the original language, luckily there is a guide for all of them on Steam so they won't stop you.

Has an interesting form of NG+ feature, achievements unlocked will contribute perk points (and sometimes availible traits to choose with them) as well a bonus attribute points in the character creator meaning you can start with a stronger PC in the future.",1701283056,1701283056,True,7,1,0.606627106666564941,0,True,False,False

hope the developers will make it so i can at least choose some of them for the next run.

+ A lot of companions to recruit and interact with
+The combat is fun (when you unlock better skills and leveled them up)
+ The pixel art is ace
+ There's a ton of content: big maps to explore, and quests ranging from side questions to faction missions to companion stories.

[b]Neutral:[/b]
* The English translations can be shoddy at times but it isn't unplayable. Even at the worse of times you'll still be able to understand the situation.
* Slow Start - I spent like 6 hours in the starting area trying to complete everything. (Might be due to skill issue or the fact that I'm playing on a harder difficulty)

- Honestly, no major gripes so far.

I will update this review when I complete the game :D

If you are just starting out I'd recommend accepting the pervy old man's help in nameless village. He is essentially the tutorial/main quest for new players.
If you wanna meta-game it a little you can immediately start a new game in nightmare mode and sleep in the temple for 101 Days to unlock tons of achievements.

Cons:
-Can be grindy at times, its hard to master passive skills (crafting, gathering, life, etc)
Suggestion: make it less grindy by improving probabilities and exp gains, since its meant to be played multiple times.
-Few Techniques/skills - Hopefully they would add more
-Few ways to power up companion stats. (MC''s stats can be so OP that you don't need companions)

Visually, Hero's Adventure is a masterpiece. The attention to detail in the environments, character designs, and special effects is outstanding.

Story 3/10
This game has a lot of characters, plenty of plot branches based on your selection and a lot of side plot.
However it not going to blow your mind. I barely get attached to any characters because their story is very short. 
Since many character can be added to your party, they barely talk in major plot.


Gameplay 9/10
For me, this is the fun part, getting stronger. This game have a lots weapon type, manuals, equipment, crafting recipe. Each of them have their own unique way to unlock. Each story branch might give you different rewards.
Trying to get all branches is also rewarding because you will unlock achievement point and unique skills which you can use on new game.

However there is a catch you have to accept - all good stuff is lock behind quest. Exploration reward is limited. Every major sect will give you several legendary tier manual, gear but only if you do their quest. If you kill the entire sect, you won't get any legendary gear.

Another downside is the weapon type. This game have like 10 different weapon type. I think it is too many.
Most weapon have 1-2 Legendary weapon and attack skill only. Sword have 4 legendary skills and 4 different weapon. Fist should have around 3-4. Other weapon is pale in comparison. Isn't it better to reduce the weapon type to 4-5 so each type doesn't feel left out. 

Luckily, you can swap weapon in the middle of the game. You just need to level up new weapon skill again. 


Characters 5/10
This game have like 16(?) female character that can be romance. You can marry to all of them and they give special unique buff. It also have ~30 male character and 8-9 pet you can recruit.

If you into character development, then you will be disappointed. It also very tedious to keep leveling up different character. Eventually you just stick with the same team and put the rest into your house for buff. 

While having recruitable char sound like good thing, i feel like it is annoying. I have to constantly read their passive skill one by one to figure out which one is the character passive skill. The dev lump all passive skill and buff into one giant tab, if you didn't pay attention to it, you won't even know what the different  between each character.


Overall
I still enjoy the game. Exploring every quest branch and recruiting every character, and find every manual, equipment is pretty fun for me. For this price, it is a damn good value if you enjoy getting cultivation game. Great replay value.",1700666632,1700934961,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game even in the state it's in, is the most impressive adaptation of wuxia into an RPG I've played.  The pixel art, the gameplay depth, the role playing depth.  It all seems outstanding.  It's just a fun game to play. 

The reason I can't tell if it's good or great really comes down to the western localization.  Won't mince words here, the translation and general localization is potentially doing this game quite a disservice.  Because while the sort of hacked and crowd sourced English translation is functional, you can understand what is going on for the most part.  Lost in that is much of the humor and character you can tell is there but the language barrier keeps us from really getting to it.

If you like games with a lot of freedom & choosing your own adventure this one is a perfect match, go buy it. If you prefer games that hold your hand and tell you what to do at each step - then maybe not a good game for you.

 English translation is not as bad as some review state - yes, its clearly not Oxford-Cambridge professional translation  by native speakers, but so far (Im about halfway in game). most of concepts, names of chracters, locations etc are properly translated.

I don't think there is much use to listing the good things - the choices, the progression, the combat all is decent & good, so I'd rather point out some negative things that are to be (hopefully!) addressed & improved in the future:

1) Some initial destinies gives certain immunities, or at least tend to give, but in fact they only work in combat. In dialogue, if you have Immunne to Poison, you still get poisoned. Have imunne to internal injury? Still get internal injury if that is in a scripted event. This ruins immersion a bit - these destinies need to be either fixed to work out of combat or tooltip added that they are fake & only work in generic combat, not for story events.
2) Companions dialogues once they join your party are a lackluster. They do not really comment on events that are happening, even if these events are something that this specific companion would DEFINITELY be engaged in, but after they join they just mostly silent...need more options to interact after they join.
3) Fame progression is too fast compared to chracter progression. Basically martially you still a nobody, just done a few lowtier beggar clearings and bam - you are ""famed"". I'd rather have longer journey to fame that it is here.
4) Some combat encounters are broken - example is the one where you are kidnapped and told not to move. Even if you obey your captors, once some (very weak!) policemen try to attack the camp (not even to ""free"" you, just to kill the bandits), you are automatically put on their side in combat & basically stomped by bandits, even if it has no logic for bandits to kill you they gain no ransom if they do so...not even option to run.
5) Same with option to face defeat in certain situations. I believe there should be more ""negative outcome but no gameover"" options, like in Tale of Wuxia, where you got beaten, your things taken, but not killed. Also, need better identificator to be able to understand - which battle will end up in you bruised & lost, and which will bring a gameover (you are killed). It is not clear here - sometimes you walk away after losing what was supposed to be obviously mortal combat, and sometimes you suddenly ""die"" in situations where enemy would really have no intention to kill you based on events, personality etc.
6) 4-directional pathing is cursed. I understand engine limitations but its downright ugly. I wish there was hexagonal movement grid and not square, but I guess its ok. Just a bit quirky in a current form.
7) Music getting bit repetitive as you play. Maybe unique themes for each region needed?

Overall: 8/10, game is not perfect but still has a lot of stuff. If you are looking to embark on a Wuxia adventure look no further than this game.",1700697198,1700697198,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having spent some time in the end game now, the scaling can get pretty out of hand and some bosses become pretty much unbeatable. Most of the game is one shotting everything until something one shots you. Unless there's a mechanic I've completely misunderstood, they should probably revisit the entire formula. Perhaps a fair stop gap would be resetting your level for a bonus (that also forces the scaling to reset) which would help keep party members more relevant. Once I hit lvl 100 I still had lvl 35 active party members because they never got turns to gain exp and the allot-able exp is never enough.

Still great game but I can see a lot of people bouncing off their first boss with 10x their hp.

long story short it's a pretty fun skyrim like game to play around.
short story long read below.
the game is Chinese and haves Chinese by default you have to switch the language in the game to english.

with a turn base system similar to Chrono Trigger, where the faster you are the more turns you can take, different weapon to use, and martial art styles to learn new skills or traits, and even recruit new followers that you can train and control, or just tame a chicken and break his back by using the chiken like a horse to ride around the world because chicken is fastest.

the game it's an open world where you have to grow your character to become the best martial artist, join Sects (Factions) to learn their skills and improve your character, gain fame by fighting in tournaments, become the leader of the Sect then fight other sects and so on, you have many ways of growing your character.

some notes of relevance the game only haves 3 zones excluding the tutorial zone, i believe they will probably add more, aside of that some places on each zone have requirements to be activated so you probably won't see every place on your map right away as you start, there are many in game system to make your character OP so you may want to take a minute to see your character sheet and read all the stat, even the FAME by defeating enemy's in duels will grant you more power.

Dump points on constitution, and choose the starter gifts tea, and other two, the rest you can level up. money is easy to come by.

You'll know I never had to grind again if you play it righteous. get tons of achievements on first play, then have fun on the next, takes a few time to unlock certain things.

Those who are complaining hadn't played through at all.

My favorite part of this charming game, where you start as a complete nobody, is the choices aren't superficial. They actually matter. (Short update paragraph for full release version at the bottom)

The Good:

- The choices you make and actions you take not only affect your character's stats but change how NPCs and factions interact with you.

- The English translation is good enough that the game is playable.

- The turn-based combat feels familiar and the grind doesn't feel unfair. 

- Choose to wander alone or build a team by inviting characters who like you to join your journey. 

- The graphics are great for pixel art.

- Steam Workshop support for mods.

- The game runs very smoothly and I've encountered zero bugs.

The Not So Good:

- The English translation seems to have been done by something like Google Translate. This means that even though many of the translations are passable, some of the translations are rough and make little sense.  

- Being that there isn't a large English speaking player base, you'll end up having to figure many things out on your own. This wouldn't be a problem if the translation was better but sometimes you'll have to take your best guess at the information a character is trying to convey and hope you get it right to advance the quest. It's particularly noticeable when you're trying to solve various riddles but the answers make no sense. Keep a notepad handy

- Equipment doesn't show up on the character sprite. I have iron armor equipped but the sprite is still wearing a robe. Not game breaking but it definitely takes away from the immersion.
 
Correcting some misinformation from negative reviews:

- Different techniques have different areas of effect as you get stronger. They also add buffs to your characters and negative traits (bleeding, poison, etc.) to enemies. The farther you progress, the more tactical the battles worth fighting become.

- Stamina is not too little, Stamina is fine and is replenished with food. I spent 3 in-game days in a certain forest grinding high value enemy drops using 3 rare meals. The grind isn't bad either since you can set the fights to auto and speed them up.

- The game is far from shallow, even for early access. There are already 4 ""true endings"" that I know of and each requires a different path and different choices. I'm convinced that anyone who claims this game lacks depth is not befriending people and raising their fame to open up special quests. A huge part of this game is interacting with everyone form homeless people and merchants to royalty and sect leaders. Reading and choosing how to respond is a huge part of this game.

      All of my issues with the game (except one) revolve around the sometimes poor translation. Hero's Adventure is in early access though so, for now, I can look past the translation. If you're looking for a game that revolves heavily around character interactions with turn-based combat and is made specifically with multiple play throughs in mind, this is a great purchase.

Update for full release: The English translation is still rough in spots but it's fully playable for native English speakers. There is so much content now and the replay value is very high. In my opinion, it's one of the best games of the year. If I went into every reason why I love this game, I'd be writing an essay. If you're looking for a ""choose your own adventure"" style game with rewarding turn-based tactics, Hero's Adventure is worth every penny.",1694201573,1700598661,True,13,0,0.645598292350769043,0,True,False,True

Well, some of us have already mentioned about the translation that is unfathomably difficult to understand, and I could not agree more. However, there are still more reasons to say no to this game than just a poor translation.

!!!! The major problem of this game is that it lacks of information !!!!

The presentation of this game seems to intentionally be designed for ""freedoms"", meaning that the games tends to allow players to independently explore or do whatever they want without sequence. However, it turned out to be that the developers completely forgot that players still need directions and information! 

To clarify, besides a better version of English translation, many players need more information. They need to know, at least, where to go or what to do (many other games have already successfully designed their games to be able to provide players with both freedoms and 'clear' directions, learn from them). I have already checked the discussions on Steam community and there are numerous people suffering from having no idea about how to continue the progress of this game and/or complete some quests. 

Edited: It is so suffocated to play this game for now but I am still putting my hope in it. While I acknowledge it's in version 1.0, I believe it shouldn't extend beyond the early access phase.

Unlike other reviews, I don't believe the English translation to be as bad as some other reviews have claimed. I never came across anything that prevented me from understanding intent. That said, it definitely could use some work for sake of clarity and polish.

There's a massive amount of content, and tons of NPCs and characters to interact with. More often than not, all of the storylines and different factions click together well in a very satisfying fashion.

Some actual cons:

- Game is incredibly unbalanced late-game. Powerhouse NPCs show up alongside cannon fodder regularly. The game never warns you when you're about to fight someone ten times more powerful than anyone you've faced before. This is an issue even on easy difficulty. I feel like no one actually playtested endgame.

- You're forced to end the game if you manage to surmount everything the game throws at you. Not sure what seems to trigger this, but after a certain point it's obvious that you're being forced to wrap things up and stop the playthrough (or get constantly assaulted by trash encounters). I don't like this forced ending in a sandbox game.


I probably had more pros and cons, but I forgot what they were. Anyway, the game is fun. If you have a middle school level understanding of English and basic middle school level reading comprehension, Hero's Adventure is fully playable in English.

BUT it's not perfect by any means. It's made on RPGmaker, which is already massige flaw - graphics is passable at most, pathfiinding is awful (even in real-time free roam you move by tiles) and equipment has 0 effect on character's appearance.

Other flaw is typical Chinese schizophrenia - get something from absolutely random location with 0 connection with currrent quest and make sure to not progress plot unless you want to fail quest. This woul work only with much better quest descriptions and much better translation. But, thank you, developers, there's not many missable quests, most of them wouldn't be affected event by being ignored half of the walkthrought.

Game itself is non-linear and tracks your progress, fame level and status pretty well, when you get to some mid level quest after [spoiler] beating all sect leaders [/spoiler] opponents will refuse to fight and surrender. But it's hella inconsistent - almost never works in main quests and it throws you out of immersing seriously. [spoiler] Like case with Ye general trial, when you're beaten by officials - I was level 90, fame 10, Peak of Jianghu andd this is pretty adequate progressiion considering enemy level at this point. Unless every official is on the level of sect leader their heads should have been sent to fly in instant[/spoiler]

But on't mind my nagging. I still recommend this game.

It's well worth the price and and imo, as someone who's been researching and reading and translating wuxia (not cultivation novels!) for around 15 years, this game is way up there for a good wuxia experience. Feels like you're roaming the jianghu as you decide through your decisions--who you join, who you help, who you don't help, who you befriend and recruit--what the main story of the game will be. As such there are multiple endings and you won't be 100% the game in one playthrough. It strikes a nice balance of using old wuxia tropes while still creating its own world. It doesn't get bogged down in pastiche, merely checking the boxes of what a wuxia experience ought to have. 

You can join whatever sect or gang you want, you can annihilate them completely. You can wipe out villages, you can make sect leaders submit to your superior skills. You can have pets. There's tournaments, different ways to level up, such as burning incense, praying, etc. There's acupoint striking where you can immobilize people and take their stuff. There's gambling. The towns feel populated, not just a tiny bare map with little to do.

For those inevitably wondering how this compares to the recently released Wandering Sword, imo WS has really fun combat but the story is more linear, not particularly well-written, and there's less to do overall. Still a good game worth getting, but for me, Hero's Adventure beats it in every category except arguably the soundtrack.

Note that this game is wuxia, not xuanhuan or xianxia.

I still recommend the game, because the gameplay, customization etc is all very fun, and the single parts of the game that, although theres quite a bit of ""Engrish"" in the menus as well, is for the most part easilly readable.

The game was originally written in Chinese, and currently has a community translation officially implemented and accessible from the main menu. However, while the translation is passable, there are definite oddities, such as the in-game riddles making no sense, and various grammar issues (Your martial arts start at ""The Oneth Level"" for example) and characters occasionally talking in third person - the 1.0 release may fix this with a better translation, but that remains to be seen.

If you're unfamiliar with wuxia, then it's very heavily martial arts themed. A big part of progression is obtaining new, more powerful martial arts. Each martial art has different stats and effects, which you can combine with the traditional levelling system (level 1 to 100), the typical RPG reminiscent stats system (constitution, luck, strength, intelligence), and equipment of various tiers and effects to make your character more powerful.

While the stats system looks fairly generic and traditional, there are some differences from what you'd expect. I'd recommend carefully reading the tool-tips, as I was rather surprised that for some reason your damage and defence stats are heavily influenced by your intelligence stat, where in other RPGs, typically those would fall under something like strength and/or constitution.

The game is ""open world"" in the sense that, as long as you have talked to the correct NPCs to unlock the areas - some of which have specific requirements - you can freely travel to and from those areas via an over-world travel map, accessed by talking to ""coachmen"", who allow you to ride a horse and carriage. This does mean that on subsequent playthroughs, you do need some knowledge of who to talk to and where they are to open up the world. In a manner that reminds me heavily of Skyrim, simply wandering around will be enough for you to encounter things, which combined with the progression system, makes this game incredibly addictive. There always seems to be something to do, a martial art to obtain or level up, equipment to get and people to talk to.

Now, the game is designed with multiple playthroughs in mind. Your first run is going to be the hardest, but as you unlock achievements you'll be able to get more traits that'll help make your next playthroughs much easier. For example, there's a trait that allows you to skip the levelling grind entirely, and a trait that amplifies the effects of your martial arts stats on your character.

The game has many different endings, and on encountering those endings you are offered the opportunity to either end your run at that ending, or to continue your adventures. There are ""bad ends"" (no, not that kind) where if you fail certain quests, take certain options or die in battle, your run will end and you'll be forced to reload.

The game has a lot of content, I've played for fifty hours and completed two playthroughs so far, and I'm not even half-way done with everything yet.

The game isn't perfect though, and there's plenty to criticise.
 While the game has an NPC (Lewd Old Man) that you encounter very early on which gives you OP abilities and items and helps guide you through the game, the game doesn't always make it clear where to go or what to do next. This can sometimes be partially because of the translation, but sometimes the instructions are so vague you'll be scratching your head. The journal often isn't helpful either, and you'll find yourself either stumbling around hoping to find it, or looking up a guide.

While you have a lot of options in terms of progressing your character, the only character customisation is the ability to name the character, and an automatic sprite change when reaching certain points in factions. You cannot change your character's appearance beyond that. With how open and free the game otherwise is, I feel it's something that really detracts from the experience.

As far as I've experienced, there's very few ambient sound effects. There's no footstep sounds, no sound of wind or rain, no birds chirping. If you have the music off, it's eerily silent most of the time, except for when very certain things happen - entering and participating combat, or some cut-scene/dialog sequences.

If you decide to kill both of the NPCs at the very start of the game, you end up getting the ""woman hater"" trait and allows you to deal extra damage to women in the game. I just wanted to do an villain playthrough, I didn't really intend to have some sort of weird vendetta against women, game.

Some weapons and types of martial arts can feel lacking. For example, there's very few dagger specific martial arts I've found, and I've yet to find a bare-handed weapon/glove beyond the starting one.

It can be very easy to miss things, and even lock yourself out of certain paths, factions, or endings. This is a double edged sword of how open and how much freedom the game gives you. You can slaughter nearly anyone you come across, or steal, or betray factions. The game won't stop you. For people like me, this'll be a great thing, but for others I can see being able to screw yourself out of things being very frustrating.

So, overall, do I recommend it? Absolutely. If what I've laid out above at all interests you, buy this game! I personally love it, I can't get enough, and will probably play a lot more of it both before and after the v1.0 release.

The closest one I can think of I've played would be Tales of Wuxia, but that's a bit of a stretch in some ways.  The simpler art style here allows you to do a LOT without melting your processor or your brain, you have a wide variety of activities and approaches in how you handle the world around you.  During the early game you're going to be focused on the easier and simpler stuff as you build up your character and understanding.  Fishing, mining, and mastering the basics are going to be your lot for a while.  But by mid to late game interesting strategies and synergies start to open up as you gradually expand your capabilities and explore the world, adding more companions, martial arts, and sects to your options.  It's easy to underestimate this game's depth based on the first few hours, but by the time you've hit your second city you're starting to realize the sort of tricks and directions you can pursue.

Of course, by then you might have bricked yourself a little and have to restart.  It's a good game, but don't let me tell you it's perfect.

The current translation is pretty good, but get a guide and make sure you have a hand on the alt-tab for various quizzes and riddles, they rely a little too much on Chinese culture to translate to the west intuitively.  They're not NECESSARY for the most part, but certain builds are going to need them.

It can be hard to balance getting new martial arts.  You SHOULD want them badly and they SHOULD be rare.  But sometimes it does feel like the game takes it too far, especially for certain branches.  Personally, I'm fine with this.  It's interesting and thematically appropriate, but it's probably going to peeve some people off.

I recommend reading through the tips before going too far into the game, there are some important explanations there that you might not understand from the tutorial prompts.  Just for starters, all your core stats can be raised to 10 (out of 20) through in game activities.  This is a difficult and long process, you're not going to manage it in a few days and will really appreciate when you meet the thresholds.

The tactic is varied without being challenging. How you build you character is impactful, for the battle and the interactions with the different NPCs during the stroy. There are like 10 different endings (?), with an amazing lore. And getting achievments is the only way to get ""karma"" points so when you start the game over it gets easier and easier to reach the endings you missed the first time (or that you didnt even know existed)!

Really refreshing! Good music. The mechanics are well balanced. I love it.

TL:DR I recommend this game highly I don't want to gas this game up too much but it's very good, and it's not even finished yet.

- Every companion has more or less something going on, either prior to or after you recruit them, sometimes both. 
- You can solo the game. Think divinity original sin 2 lone wolf.
- You can side with whoever you want
- want to be an asshole? be an asshole. Want to rob people? rob them!
- There are a surprising amount of options you have in dialogue that genuinely lead to different results
- There are a ridiculous amount of endings, and even then you can continue the storyline for a better ending I went from high ranking official > legendary Military commander > Sect leader > to Martial peak
- The Zither is fucking GOAT'd, its actually disgusting.
- I've beaten the game multiple times and I'm still not done.

I might have enjoyed this game more than Immortal Tales of Rebirth

That being said there are some things I hope they improve on, as the game seems to be actively being worked on and isn't finished.
- Character creator needs appearance customization, gender options too, and that includes faction gear. I want to at least be able to recognize myself from the other soldiers in the battalion I'm in, It's literally the same sprites.
- The mastery skills honestly need an exp boost imo, I did not mind grinding them out but if story dialogue checks are going to incorporate them in the choices I'd like to at least be able to do some of them without worry. This is probably related to having multiple runs as it seems easier after maxing certain skills.
- let us ride our mounts in areas and towns.
- Hopefully, more higher rarity martial arts will be scattered around the game in future releases, being a Staff user in a Spear Faction was straight up PAINFUL later in the game, and I had to resort to robbing a Monk Temple lmao.",1698166098,1698166098,True,4,0,0.558568954467773438,0,True,False,True

The difficulty settings are nicely balanced with harder modes giving more exp so you can get going faster to fight stronger enemies (We don't talk about Free Mode 1600, that is not balanced).
Enemies grow stronger as time passes but you can outpace them easily. Its cool to be able to fight an level 50 enemy or come back in 30 days to fight them at level 70 instead.
The game lets you fail quests and you receive appropriate punishments for recklessly killing people off.

This is an amazing indie game, even in its current state (early access). There is already enough content to easily play over 100 hours. The game offers an unbelievable amount of freedom and depth for an indie game.

To start, there are no invincible characters; you can kill ANYONE at ANY time and fully destroy any of the 20+ factions, armies, or do mass killings in cities and villages, provided you are strong enough (and believe me, you need to be STRONG to even scratch some of the NPCs, some of them dispatch YOU like a random encounter). Killing NPCs will, of course, heavily impact the run and the events you can do.

Secondly, the game has high replay value. As you progress in the game, reaching a certain level of cultivation in some stats, accomplishing difficult feats, or unlocking secrets and endings can lead to unlocking various starting titles, innate abilities, and traits that can improve or alter your character's stats and growth potential for the next run. So, in the first run, you may be at the mercy of some NPCs or events even at very high level, which you can overturn in subsequent runs at much lower levels. This leads to new story events, new companions, keeping old companions, or achieving new endings. The game is also designed so that you cannot do everything in a single run; you cannot join opposing factions and trigger all events; being friendly with one NPC may draw animosity from another. It's only through multiple runs that you can experience the entire game and get all the endings.

Thirdly, good character building system - there are perks, attributes, and hundreds of different martial arts, traits and titles to stack together and build various kinds of characters. There is also multiple weapon types and equipments to flesh out your build. The martial arts have 10 levels of proficiency, the 10th level (max mastery) drastically improves the martial arts and makes it feel worthwhile. 

Fourth, you're free to go anywhere in the game without restriction once you discover these locations (though you may be killed by high-level NPC encounters if you are too low level).

Lastly, there are a LOT of companions. I'm not exactly sure how many companions there are in total, but over my few runs, I was able to recruit more than 15 different companions. Once you get NPCs to certain levels of friendship, some of them will join you based on prestige, alignments, or who you are affiliated with.",1697601139,1697602912,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

A wonderful pixel-art game with a Wuxia setting so expect a lot of kung fu lore coming with it. 

I've got 191 hours into the game. And it really captures the feeling of having both a freedom of how to approach situations and how to get strong. Lots of secrets hidden in the game which also makes you explore a lot. 

Do be aware that if you join the old man during the beginner quests that you'll be stuck in his faction. There are ways to get out of it though. But he's a good guide to explore the game if you're a beginner and gives OP manuals/items to help you. If you deny him then you're basically free to do anything and everything right from the start. Which does make the game harder to beat.

Pros:

- Good stories in the game.
- Freedom of choice in game which leads to different endings. (more than 10 I think.)
- Turn based for anyone who likes to have more time plotting their tactics.
- Nostalgic pixel-art. It isn't something to go 'Wow!' about but definitely visual pleasing. Do check the options to change text style.
- There's quite a number of skills already available during this early access.
- Tactical combat that makes you want to min-max your skill tree, external skills and internal skills.
- Haven't encountered game breaking bugs as of now.**
- There's English translation. Albeit, not the best yet but most of it is understandable.**
- Nightmare difficulty. Only choose this difficulty if you want nigh unkillable masters if you take too long to grow strong. They also level up their skills/level over time. 
- You can grind skill levels or find ways to unlock better quest chain to make you grow strong faster. (You do have auto combat option but it's not smart. So only use it for casual level grind.)
- Likeable main character and female characters. (No gender selection though.)
- Time system and hunger/mood. Keep the bar for hunger high and you'll stay strong and mood is for Exp gain.
- Crafting weapons is 'always' the best way to get better weapons. So crafting is actually useful compared to most games.
- A relationship system that changes according to your choices. You can make lots of friends or lots of enemies. Get it high enough to marry some companions. 

Cons:

- It does need better translations. Especially during poetry (couplets). Luckily, there's a guide to solve them on steam.**
- Need more unique skills. Blue (rare) skills are basically all the same. Purple and gold skills do differ. But we need more of it.**
- Need more crafting manuals for blacksmith/tailoring/cooking/handicraft. Right now I've only found legendary manuals for swords and 1 possible legendary food manual.**
- Certain weapons needs more update to be viable in fights. Right now I find the fist and sword to be the strongest.**
- That poor girl Fu Qing needs a better name. Because it's pinyin, you can read it as 'Father'. If you marry her, you're marrying father. (╯‵□′)╯︵┴─┴
- Some story needs more fleshing out.
- Some npc pathing will hinder your movement. And there's one tailor npc that will block you from going out for 2-5 seconds if you go behind her counter to loot her stuff. (It sounds bad, but that npc and I have a good relationship.)**
- Would be great to if we can choose which uniform the protagonist wears.

1. AI有点问题，30年前的金庸群侠传2的敌人AI较好，中毒会逃开自己解毒，重伤会逃开自己吃药，回血等，再回来攻击。这个版本AI有问题，身上有药也不会逃开吃药，一直战斗到死，太笨。还有金2的敌人会用好自己的强项，暗器的就保持好距离一直出暗器，施毒强的就会频频施毒。这个版本的AI不会利用自己的强项，有问题。期望版本更新时有改正。
2. 受伤属性也有问题，好像只有内伤跟流血不会随回合解，其他的2个回合就解了，太离谱了。这样练药品就没意义了。我都玩一百多小时了，药品一次也没用过。应该让有些伤像骨折，内伤等重伤要去医术高者的地方才能医（可以有一些剧情去找药引材料，极品材料就很有必要了），会更贴近武侠世界，轻伤有些能在战斗时用医疗，有特定属性的伤不能用医疗解属性，需要吃特定的药品去解（流血要止血丸等）。这样才贴近武侠世界，练药采集类的才更有必要。
3. 还有阴性阳性内功应该有限制，阴的只能学阴的，阳的只能学阳的，需要玄冰碧火酒之类的道具或神奇遭遇才可以调和内力。这个版本阴性的也可以练阳性的，阳性的也可以练阴性的，感觉内功阴阳分没意义了，而且中性内功太容易得到就不珍贵了。如果可以加同性内功疗伤就会很贴切，阳性内功的可以医阳性内伤，阴性内功可医阴性内伤，中性内功两样都可医。这样可以丰富队友的选择。另外，内力值高的，内伤抵抗力应该高，内力值低的，内伤抵抗力应该低。内伤重伤后，休息不能回复内力不能回血。需要内功疗伤和特别的药品先解除内伤属性，才可回复内力。内力值和防御力应该有关联，内力值越高，防御力就越高。",1697437357,1697439062,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

เป็นแนวจอมยุทธที่ปล่อยฟรีที่สุดที่เคยเจอแล้ว แทบจะเรียกได้ว่าไม่มีเนื้อเรื่องหลักจริงจังตามที่เกมอื่นๆเป็น แต่เกมนี้อยู่ที่เราเลือกดำเนินเองล้วนๆ ถึงพอเล่นไปจนปลดรู้แมพรู้อะไรเกือบทั้งหมดแล้วจะดูเล็กไปหน่อยสำหรับระบบประมาณนี้ แต่รูททางเลือกที่มีให้ ก็อัดแน่นจนเรียกได้ว่าไม่รู้จะไปทำอะไรก่อนดี

TL;DR: Awesome game if you can tolerate the current bad translation. Incredible progression, amazing artstyle and graphics. Combat's very fun because of the well made skill and combat animations, amazing build variety, masterly designed difficulty curve. Story is compelling, even with the bad translation. And to top ot off a lot of replay value, achievments unlock more stat points and trait points on new games with various levels of difficulty, even custom one. You can play this game for 45 hours and still miss A LOT of stuff and find new stuff everyplaythrough. If you like tactics games this is a must have! If the devs translate this properly it will sell like water.

A lot of content, beutiful and very detailed artstyle, very fun combat mechanics. There are very few bugs, but not really a lot of major ones. In 45 hours of play I only saw a minor one. That being said, there are a few things lacking. Mostly companion content, there are a lot of compelling and interesting compainios, but they mostly have a VERY small questline associeted with them. Because of that, even though there are a lot of different companions, most of them feel shallow.

The companions that suffer the most with this are the marriable companions, short questline and then marriage. Feels weird and lacking, the most interesting companion is the Ye army girl, because she is the only one with multiple unique events. That makes her have more of a personality than all other companions. It would be cool if other marriable companions could be like this, well, even better if there were more companions with deeper storylines. 

Combat is amazing. Best turn based martial arts simulator ever, you REALLY feel the progression. From a useless moron to a martil arts god, and that is just SO. FUCKING. SATISFYNG. But, there could be a bigger variety of moves. And, although the combat system is VERY intuitive the attributes are a nightmare and some abilities, because of the bad fan translation, are incomprehensible. Putting more tooltips and info about how stats affect your combat performance is a must. 

The worst part about combat is the lack of uniqueness and variety in most weapon techniques. it would be cool if there were more skills and they were more unique and specialized. Because of that the trait that makes every skill usable without weapon restrictions is a must have if you want variety. But mixing weapon skills with it activelly punishes you, so there's a big player incentive to specialize. 

Adding more skills and making each weapon have multiple possible builds solves this. It would make experimenting with diferent combat styles way more viable and the mid-game combat way more diverse. 

The artstyle is fucking wonderful, it looks like a saturday morning kung-fu cartoon that's VERY detailed. You can see the love in the art. The soundtrack is wonderful, lacks a little variety, but what's there's incredible.  

The devs seem to be making regular updates and adding a lot content regurlarly. Even though it's in early accesss this game punches way above it's price. Really hope the devs add more content, hell, hope the game sells a lot and they release a TON of DLC for this. Worth double it's price, easily.

English translation is still awful, but if the devs DO translate this it would make the game 10x better for english speakers.",1696997704,1696997704,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I have limited knowledge on chinese language, so I have been playing the game in English. Translation quality is a bit strange but serviceable, but due to that, the words would most likely overflow as the game was not designed for English language. 
For gameplay wise, it has a very good game loop. To summarize it, the loop would be play the game to get achievements, reach end game with true ending or restart the game again without doing so. Reaching the true endings would let you carry forward the maxed out profession skills (like mining, crafting etc). Not reaching any ending however, you could still has some benefits from the achievements that you get while playing the game. Those achievements would let you unlock more perks and achievement points that you could make your character slightly stronger upon each restart. Note: you wont be carrying forward any of your martial arts and items even if you reached the true endings. 
For the perspective of story, it is depending on what type of ending you would like to get. In the journey to get there, you will get quite a number of side quests and events that would only trigger upon certain criteria were met, like your reputation, your benevolence etc. Some events might directly end your journey if your stats did not reach certain qualification. 
Tips, for examination quests, you could find the answers in the steam forum for this game OR you could use a mod that would put the correct answer in the first choice every time.",1696558668,1696558668,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

When you go to the statue city and are asked to meet the general the gates guards ask for 10 scrap silver, a number that i can't find anywhere i look playing already 23 hours, yes you can kill them all at some point but that's counter productive as your master says his an old friend, so the main quest ended here for me as this is very dumb and there inst 10 god damn scrapy silver anywhere i look.

Collecting all the resources leads nowhere as you need blueprints to do anything so its pointless, the grind would be absurd  aswell, who wants to make 100 plus wooden swords to get to lv 1 to 2, 1 wooden sword = 5 wood, you would need to gather 500 wood, 1 tree = 10 wood tops, good luck with that.

The gameplay is really fun, the graphics look kinda beautiful for a 2D game, and the music is excellent. Mandatory grinding is minimal (skip smithing/mining, it's worthless), The game is extremely different than most FF Tactics-style games but overall it's best-in-class. 

There are many things I wish I knew at the start. 
--[b]For your first playthrough, I STRONGLY recommend Easy difficulty[/b]. Several late-game bosses and even some tournament fights are wildly difficult on early playthroughs. 
--[b]For starting traits, I recommend anything which increases your action speed and Effective Learner. [/b] Effective Learner doubles the effectiveness of weapons skills learned from martial arts manuals and is the best in the game. 
--[b]Starting weapons: I recommend Blades or Swords on your first playthrough[/b]. With either Blades or Swords, your most important attribute to focus on will be Dexterity. 
--Mid-game you’ll have an option to join a Sect and a Faction. Sects are the most reliable way to find the most important powerup in the game, great weapon abilities. If you're on Blades, you can also gain powerful abilities by convincing the butcher to join your party or defeating your rival Fu several times. If you're on Swords, Lainya Sword Pavilion is probably the strongest Sect for you but more grindy than most. (Like, do you actually want to become a master miner and a grandmaster blacksmith? These are semi-required in their quest line). 
-- I think reaching the end of the main Emperor plotline requires joining a Faction. I've only been able to join the Yi Family Battalion faction and don't know if the others are open to players at this point. If the main plot has stalled out and you haven't been asked to rescue the Emperor yet, try interacting with the members of your faction and completing any assignments they give you.
--After you've unlocked the horse from the starting village and have accumulated around $1000-1500, your first big decision in the game is which of the three cities to visit first. (Each interstate trip is very expensive early-game so it's a meaningful decision). [b]The best early option is the Eastern city, Linan[/b]. You can earn $10,000 every 5 days in the Eastern city by winning the Underground Arena. To unlock the UA, talk to everybody in the Eastern city's hotel and then talk with the Performing Artist in the Eastern city's market (daytime only), he will give you the password to get through the Underground Arena's guard. 
--There's some randomness in which enemies you draw in Underground Arena. On rounds 4 and 5, you can draw a really easy win (like a level 20-30 human enemy or a high-level animal) OR an impossibly difficult level 50-60 human enemy like the butcher or the sinister old woman. It's okay if you're only winning runner-up at the start, that still pays $5000. Or you can reload a save for another chance at $10,000. 
--Most fights do not pay money. You can earn $1000 each day by training apprentices at any city's dojo where you have sparred with the dojo master on the highest setting. This is usually achievable by level 20 or 30. 
--""Passive"" abilities are extremely important. If you're not sure what to focus on, the Wind school's Fearless Charge and Windwalker add a tremendous amount of damage and mobility, the Earth school's Armor Build-Up adds a lot of survivability in drawn out battles, and the Yin school's Deadly Strike is useful if you're inflicting status ailments. [b]I generally give Wind School an S-tier and Earth an A-tier.[/b] 
--[b]All of the extremely difficult fights in the game are one-on-one[/b]. I do not recommend Passive abilities geared towards groups of enemies. 
--The English-translated riddles won’t make any sense unless you speak Chinese. Check Steam’s guide if you need the answers. I recommend skipping riddles unless you’re joining the Confucius Sect. 
--Weapon skills are mainly improved by equipping and mastering kung fu manuals. [b]Just using your sword a bunch won't improve your Sword stat.[/b] (Your starting traits and a few consumables also help). 
--In MOST games, becoming a grandmaster blacksmith is the best way to get the best weapons. [b]But it's usually worthless in this game[/b]. In this game, almost all equipment is garbage, and the few pieces that are notably better than using your starting weapon are obtained via quests and exploration. Unless you're a member of the Lainya Sword Pavilion, I don't recommend getting into smithing at all. 
--There's nobody in the starter village that buys weapons!? So smithing is even more worthless than normal early on. 
--I don’t know if they’ve implemented Craft Armor yet. I’ve played for 100+ hours and haven’t seen ANY armor recipes.
--[b]Non-combat skills do not matter[/b]. The only ones which are actually semi-helpful are Explore and Machinery. Mid-game you can train Machinery (the lockpicking skill) with the head of the Tomb Raiders sect and one of the named characters at the Water Camp even if you haven't joined these groups. (If you've joined the Confucius Sect, the guy with the wheelchair at your sect is also an option). 
--It's a bit grindy, but you can leave your one Sect and join another, though I don't think this is required for any endings or achievements.  
--In the Southern city, there is a hero statue. If you bow to it 10 times (previously 100 in earlier builds), you receive a kickass sword. After you get the sword, the statue starts giving OUTRAGEOUS amounts of Luck Experience and it’ll take another 10 minutes (~125 bows) to get your Luck stat from 1 to 10. 
--If you’re under 10 in an attribute, you can boost it with practice. Strength grows over time with mining/chopping/gathering, Luck if you use the statue, and Dexterity if you run around. Intelligence and Constitution don’t have any practical options at present. [b]Except for Luck, I do not recommend spending time grinding up stats, stats which aren't tied to your main weapon aren't usually particularly helpful[/b]. 
--Late game, you'll be introduced to something called the ""Peak of Challenge"". This isn't part of the main quest and is mainly a show of supremacy, so don't be discouraged if you try it and get instantly smoked. The game actually intends you to go through the Emperor's storyline (unlocked through your faction).
--Back attacks only trigger if you are in the ONE tile immediately behind an enemy. Side attacks only appear to trigger immediately beside the enemy. Overall, back and side attacks help but less than in most games. If you have to choose between a back-attack (+30% damage and increased critical rates) and running around the world to wreck someone with Fearless Charge, FC is usually way better. Using Windwalker, you can engineer turns so that you get both the back-attack AND a huge charge bonus. [b]This is the way.[/b] 
--A ""shichen"" is 2 hours. A ""sky"" is a day. A ""ke"" is 15 minutes. Stores refresh at midnight (“zi”).

all the training, ending is scripted,
you get multiple ending from 1 game,
it looks nice.

but every thing is scripted, if you dont follow the script, 
you wont get your ending,
u accidentally done something from another script for another ending,
you end yourself.

if you dont look at those script from online disccusion,
you won't even know what you doing and can you find the ending.

Pro:
-自由度高, (開放)世界, 如果未來擁有隨機事件與路人都可以招募 可玩性很高. 希望半瓶醋能讓這個沙盒世界生動。大部分腳色商販可以建立情誼，希望未來選項更多可以拉小販入隊，或是拉個鑑定師入隊功能性高,目前只有特殊腳色可以拉入隊。可以偷搶下毒潛行，開放世界遊戲的快樂 (類似天際6可以放木桶在NPC頭上擋住視線然後偷光他家的雜物,雖然沒啥意義但是讓我嘴角上揚)
Con: 
-希望戰鬥機制能改進, 目前除了站背後/身側有攻擊加成,這遊戲機本沒戰術純純手游看數值，尤其遊戲前期腳色只有一兩招,完全沒戰術都是繞背放技能，中後期雖然有數個技能但是戰鬥還是不變繞背放招只是加些微效果, 希望能有意義的搭配招式跟 尤其是限制技能 目前只要敵人高你等級一截, 就算你是純風流也很難風箏 同伴搭配基本上只有死前幫你挨打兩回. 很多回合遊戲有瘸腿, 禁言, 滑倒, 魅惑,嘲諷之類的，讓你動腦搭配實現奇蹟戰術，現在挑戰以弱勝強只能下毒, 或是敵人動一次小夥伴打一輪(基本上也不是以弱勝強團隊傷害跟血量加起來會比敵人高), 基本上點開敵人屬性你就知道你打不打得過。沒有甚麼有意思的流派跟玩法，目前勉強算戰術的就只有回血拉打 (低等單挑邋遢張，純風流可以跑兩段，近身用流血攻擊換傷一輪然後邊逃邊補血繞著城跑)。大部分戰鬥就是-本座數值比你高一截所以你自裁吧，大部分高等腳色都在小房間導致戰鬥都只是對砍如果自動戰鬥會繞背的話這遊戲電腦自己玩就好了

-升級機制很有問題，目前刷怪以及作任務的回報幾乎沒有,打完一張圖的敵人也許功法可以升一重，升級機制就是跟武館或是門派切磋基本上就是站樁切磋大概一兩回合升一重 我來回跑了好幾個小時解任務還沒有我站樁門派10分鐘升級的多

-賺錢機制也很有問題, 目前邪道賺錢太快 開局出新手村直上賭坊SL大法直接50貫+,玩得好可以80貫+。新手教學 收集資源賣商人根本就是騙新手 連營養費(體力)跟交通費都不太夠 (曾經我也天真地賣樵夫鐵匠), 其他點穴偷一輪就不說了開局直接各大門派親王府繞一圈(潛行引人探查點穴清空) 直接甲級飾品乙級藥品基本用到結局(導致煉藥沒意義)。除了偷賭搶正道唯一，就是拍賣高級材料重點是一次最多賣一件，都已經限制資源一天重生一次所以不會無限採集崩壞經濟, 玩家不會選擇賣乙丙因為浪費拍賣欄位，賣甲級只是浪費送禮資源跟材料 來回各大拍買場跑的時間大概賭場都重新開盤了還省下甲級資源。建議工作室考慮打怪掉裝備，不但彌補悲慘的升級機制讓跑圖有意義，還可以下調甲級資源價值以及解鎖更多拍賣欄位讓經濟更正常化，讓玩家真正使用甲級

- 最後希望希望這是真-沙盒世界。目前腳色門派或是選項選錯了直接血流成河 甚至偷竊被抓導致滅了某門，期間的所有互動功法腳色任務都沒了。鬼谷的特色是功法門腳色隨機升成人人都有親友會放話報仇，太吾的特色人人可以當好友 殺了長門還可以扶持自己喜歡的長老,或是綁架掌門長老來刷功法裝備可玩性很多，都還可以見一次打/綁架一次打 到人家心態炸裂。大俠目前世界死板重複性很低選錯就只能開二周目，如果可以生成腳色或是只有親友仇殺不但寫實很多還可以避免交惡一人必須滅門。滅了幾次就只能重開因為世界變成空舞台",1689358067,1689358067,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,True

A traditional Chinese tactical combat Wu Xia RPG with additional elements. Combat turns is determined by ""gathering speed"", whoever gather enough speed will get to act first. There is of course skills, martial arts and weapons that reduces that, which makes the combat semi interesting. 
This game can be hard when first started, you don't recover health after combat. You cannot sell whatever you looted to a single vendor (other than pawn shop which can only be found in big city), specific NPC vendor will only accept specific items. But you can trade most item with all the NPCs in the game world. 
Trading, eating and resting is important part of the game. 

Thinks i like about this game so far :.

1) Nice music and good pixel graphics.

2) Every little things you do will have impacts, steal things? your etiquette level will drop and gifting NPCs will keep it up. Run away from combat and leave your companions behind? Your loyalty level will drop. Finishing quest and meeting time will up your reliability and so on. There are 6 non combat stats, every stats have special bonus that can be unlock once you reach either 100 or -100. Some character will only join if your stats are high enough too.

3) Open world with day/night cycle, but not in a big sandbox kind. You can choose region to travel, there will be city (City is decent size) and other places of interest. Some will only be shown on map after talking to NPCs in the game. 

4) Ability to tame all kinds of animals, i'm able to tame a named wild boar, a dog, a cat and a rooster so far. Pets can join you in combat and they don't occupy your companion slot (only 1 pet at a time). But they can't learn martial arts or equip items. Pets needs to be consistently fed thought, if not they will get into weaken state (penalty to all their stats). Now some pets can act as ""Rides"" interact with them for traveling to other map, instead of paying for horse carriage.  

5) A bit of survival game play, needed to eat, rest and keep mood in the positive. Most of the stuff you do in game will cost energy. If energy or happiness level reaches below 50% character will get penalty to stats. Energy can be recover a little by eating, resting will recover most of it if not all.

6) Crafting. Health don't recover after combat and there is hunger, mood bar to manage. This makes cooking rather meaningful for me.

7) A lot of interesting NPCs to recruit,  most of them have back story and mini quests.

Thinks i feel can be better :.

1) NPC with their own schedules is only to certain extends, NPCs will start doing their own things during day time mostly just walking around or stand in front of their shop/stall, nothing sophisticated. At night they just disappear and i don't see any NPCs sleeping in bed (just stand around in their home). Not a big deal but kind of a bummer.

2) [strike] Creature / enemy re-spawn is irritating, after fighting all the way into a cave or enemy territory, you probably have to fight your way out again as the enemy you just cleared is re-spawn behind you. [/strike]
Not as bad now, the spawn rate has reduced from what i see.

3) [strike] NPCs dialogue needs work, a lot don't make sense. Feel like they put it in just so that the NPC have something to say. [/strike] They have iron out a lot of it.

4) There's a lot of weapon and Martial Arts to use and learn, but currently they looks the same. Even animation is the same.

5) No selection of female as main character, no cosmetic or customization to be make so far.

6) Most NPCs looks the same too.

Still a great game for me, really enjoy it. [strike] Almost 20 hours in and i only visited 3 region. [/strike] Its still early access but i have not encounter any bug big or small, just missing features. Hopefully they add more stuff and make the NPCs feel more alive. 

Been awhile and still only 3 Major cities, their recent updates added in gamble den, nothing fancy just throwing of dices. Ability to join and play as Shaolin Monks (Very repetitive to progress) with its own mini story, they do provide user with strong skills and moves tho.

The English mod is not perfect but it helps a lot for ppl that can't read Chinese, like me.
The background music is also good and fitting with the theme and mood.

Some quests have time, at first I thought that's quests with limited time, which I hate, but I found out that the timer in quest is actually not time limit, it's just a timer for unlocking the next progress, only have to wait until time expire. Because the game has day and night cycle. So quest like wait for me 3 days to heal myself will have to expire that timer before allowing to continue the quest. Something like that. Haven't found any time limited quest yet.

Combat can be auto-ed and sped up to 4x so mundane fights are not annoying. 

This game is a sandbox with some events triggered when requirements are met. It is quite deep regarding character progression. There are many life skills such as mining, woodcutting, smithing, identification for jewelry, identification for books, aprraisal for antiques, fishing, etc. Can learn that by self with little exp gain or learn from NPC by befriending them and when friend point to an NPC is high enough it will allow learning from said NPC. Here's the interesting part, I can steal any items in the game, but there is a stat named Courtesy that will be deducted if I steal npc's items laying around, if I steal too much Courtesy will be minus and at that point my character is seen as rude, and even if I gift NPC, the friend point increase will be just 1/10. So there is advantage but there is disadvantage playing with good/evil path. But things can still be obtained or achieved regardless of any path, and have their own advantage or disadvantage. Things that cannot be obtained are intended, like it has requirement to be in a specific sect.

There is also sect system, the higher the reputation the better/more skill will be taught. Can even be sect leader and have access to much better skill later.",1687897326,1688123849,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

To developers: Just a suggestion, it will be good to reduce the random parts, for example, during character creation, there is too much randomness in selecting the desired traits,  the randomness also extends to other mini games like mining, fishing or chopping lumber.

为什么我会给这么低分是因为对我儿言武侠游戏要做的好是要带点“中华艺术和文化”，例如X先生的作品为什么会印象深刻他的游戏我小时玩了到现在都还记得。游戏里很有艺术的作品在艺术里埋伏了中华古时代武侠的文化，本来不想读书的我玩了他的游戏都会翻下书看看历史，下棋，中华乐器，对诗等等都会去研究下。拿其它的来说如果惡靈古堡 4 remake把恐怖游戏的艺术拿掉做成纯动作游戏会有什么感想。

优点：
1。武功修炼
2。体力处事
这两个做到还不错

缺点：
1。大地图做到有点草率。
2。没什么艺术就纯打怪升级拿武功比武。
3。故事感觉可以做到多点互动效应，现在是把人物事情做好就加入拿武功。
4。现在感觉就那几个人物过分的强大就练到打赢他们就可以了。

I believe that with the future update of the game, the developer will also modify some inappropriate time limits in the quest.

=======================
I haven't seen a game that can make me forget the passage of time for ages, so I'm very delighted to meet this game.

Unfortunately, I was so busy at work. I could only spare some time to play this game. When I turned off this game, I was very reluctant to leave.

Let's not talk about the advantages of the game here. If you are interested in it, you can use Google Translate to read comment and the introduction of the store page.

What I want to stress, is the weakness of the game: time limit. Firstly, there was a time limit for the whole game — only 100 days, and it could not be set by hand. Of course, this might be one of the reasons why the game was currently in Early Access. Hope the final version of this game could set it according to the players' preferences.

Second, there was also have time limit for some quests. And some were too short, if you open the quests was in the wrong period of time, it would directly lead to the failure of the quests.

For example, in the Unmarked Village, the blacksmith asked you to collect 8 pieces of iron ore in 4 hours (game time). This game requires an iron pickaxe to mine ore. The simplest way to obtain a pickaxe is to consult the miners in the daytime, but the miners go home for rest at night, and this event cannot be triggered. Although there may be other ways to obtain the pickaxe, if you trigger this branch task at night, because you are not familiar with the game, it is likely to fail at that time point because of overtime. Although I haven't played the game for a long time, I have encountered such difficulties at the beginning of the game, and I'm sure I will encounter the same difficulties later. I hope that developers can take this into consideration from the perspective of players.

Even so, if you can understand Chinese, I still recommend you to play this game. The game was currently in Early Access, but there was still a lot of content to play. And I have pointed out the shortcomings of the game above, that is because I love this game and want it to become better. The quality of the game itself is excellent. I believe that you can understand my feelings after you play it.

In the end, I hoped that the developer could stick to update and be good at taking the advice of the players to improve the game. Over the years, I've seen too many Early Assess games stop update halfway. Or the final version of the game was terribly bad.",1678350391,1678417988,True,32,0,0.732295632362365723,0,True,False,True
