The English version has 6 groups of 8 puzzles. The Chinese version has 8 sections of 8 puzzles plus one section with 6 puzzles, grouped differently than in the English version. I have no idea whether or not that means there is no intention to ever bring the two versions in sync. (Incidentally, this difference in how the stories are arranged is the reason why the screenshot on the store page which shows eight panels with pictures and captions is so absurdly wrong, the captions don't match the pictures. The layout in the released version is different.)

The store page should say ""situation puzzles"" in all caps and flashing colors and with lots of exclamation marks. I think that term is more widely known than ""albatross soup"", and the first few screenshots don't make it immediately obvious what the gameplay is like. This isn't an investigation-style game where you have to uncover clues by observing and interacting with the environments. It's a collection of lateral-thinking puzzles with the classical rules of asking questions that can be answered only with yes/no/irrelevant, with minor variations allowed in some special cases.

There is a rather big catch though. The game is playable offline, BUT only certain predetermined questions work in offline mode. I wish the game had fully functional offline mode, [i]I doesn't exist[/i] did something similar without requiring an Internet connection (irrespective of how good or bad that game is), so I think TH could do it as well. Also, since the game asks for feedback on AI answers, there should be a clarification about what data is being collected, currently there is no mention of that anywhere.

If you get stuck, there are quite a few other ways to get to the answers: noticing some elements that get gradually revealed in the picture, examining the surrounding text, choosing a predetermined question that can pop up automatically when you type in relevant words, guessing words by just typing them in, guessing words by their length or revealed letters, uncovering words by playing Wordle, requesting hints (you can uncover a word or see one of those predetermined questions or a part of the picture).

In fact, sometimes the game is too generous with what gets revealed automatically and which words it considers to be synonyms. I think a hardcore mode where yes/no/irrelevant is the only feedback would be a nice addition to the game. Currently it's not quite possible to play the game exactly like that.

The claim that the game contains nothing revolting or unpleasant is arguable. There are a couple of puzzles that I would say cross the line between grimly amusing and grimly repulsive.

In the TH version of Wordle, if you enter ""ever"" and the correct word is ""evil"", the second ""e"" is highlighted as being present in the word. I think that's not how it should work. Also, the input doesn't have to be an actual word, it can be a random combination of letters, which also seems questionable.

The filtering rules need to be improved. The game doesn't accept questions that contain the words ""who"", ""spot"" or ""racoon"" because it drops a part of the word and declares that the resulting word is inappropriate.

The UI should definitely be improved as well. It's not possible to scroll the text using the up/down arrow keys or PgUp/PgDn, scrolling with the mouse wheel is very slow, and the vertical scrollbar is just broken, sometimes it doesn't react or shifts the text in the wrong direction. Sometimes it's not possible to just start typing, you have to click on the input field first. The triangle buttons that switch between pages in the case record appear broken at first because you have to click on the very tip of the triangle, clicking anywhere else on it does nothing.

There are some silly slip-ups such as ""the girl in a white dress"" wearing a red dress in the picture.

The ""Ask when starting game"" setting to choose between English and Chinese doesn't work if you start the game via the desktop shortcut, it just launches the Chinese version.

The English translation leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't become incomprehensible, but things like ""The woman was stroke to death"" come close to ruining the experience.",1708708390,1709074444,False,0,0,0.582884132862091064,0,True,False,False

Great interface
Lots of options for solving puzzles
Mysteries are entertaining and surprising although some are not for the faint of heart
There are some translation issues, but nothing that would keep you from solving puzzles/enjoying the game

There is an overarching story to unlock as well which is very entertaining

I started playing 2 days ago and have been screaming through it since then. Less than 8 puzzles to go!

You can ask Turlock the turtle any yes or no question about the puzzle and in my experience he does a good job of answering and giving hints.   Its very cozy and fun game to enjoy with your coffee.  
You can technically brute force the words since it doesn't require the inputs to be a real word.  However I think that's not as fun so I only let myself put in real words.

The game is simple, too simple. I made it harder for myself by not using mushrooms to get answers and by not playing the wordle like game.

The stories are quite dark, not the type of game that a kid could play, but why are the mecanics so easy? A kid could play this, even a six year old could. But the stories aren't for them.
