You can make pretty much anything you can think of in regards to animation.

There are some downsides though. SFM can be pretty limited due to the Source engine. A couple of the biggest problems I have with it is that maps can only be so large.
And lights are only limited to spotlights. They only light up what's infront of them in a cone of light.

well, strap yourself in, because that's gonna take like a month to learn, and each animation is probably gonna take 4-5 days. i've never done an animation, but i'd imagine that it would take that long for a beginners animation.

so far all i've done is some posing (made my fucking profile pic using this. it's so fucking nice) and it was fun, for about 2 weeks, then i just got too impatient with all the finger posing and gave up.

it takes a good 30 minutes to get the fingers into place, then when you move it, it all fucks up.



still, if you'd like to make a poster about a guy jumping down from a bridge with a blade in his hand ready to stab some rebel scu- i mean someone, feel free to learn how to do it. that's a really cool idea. i should make that.

Yes, this is still in Beta.

Yes, there are uses for SFM other than porn.
No, you can't just easily port maps into SFM.

Yes, animation is a tedious process that will take time to get used to, and is also something that requires patience.
Yes, this program can crash and it will make you upset.
Yes, I recommend you get the best fucking RAM in the world before you start making movies that are longer than two minutes.
No, the SFM workshop is not as big as the Garry's Mod cancer workshop.

Posing and animating is inherently better than Gmod( I still like Gmod though). SFM gives you better precision in making things do what you want.

With a little patience, you can make awesome animations and images. If you can imagine it, chances are you can do it in SFM. 

There's a con, though:

Maps and models: not enough. The selection of maps and models are tiny compared to Gmod. On the subject on Gmod, with a little work you can import Gmod models into SFM and they work fairly well when you just focus on posing. Animating, though, is a different story. It requires more work to make it animate correctly compared to the models specifically designed for SFM.

However, beginners will find this tool to be very complicated at first glance. When I started out with SFM I had no idea what I was doing. That's why I strongly urge new users to watch ALL of the Valve tutorials on YouTube at least a few times. This helped not only me, but several other people understand how to work with SFM. I currently only make posters with SFM not animations because I am still confused on how it opperates. One animator on YouTube, The Winglet, gave me a reason to continue my involvement with SFM. His animations are smooth, funny, and even a bit graphic at times. I believe that anyone who uses SFM can learn to understand it with both time and patience. Just think what I always think: 'Perfection requires perserverance.' I wish good fortune to anyone who decides to work with this software and that maybe one day they will become a great animator.",1485998554,1485998554,True,5,0,0.57706981897354126,0,True,False,False
