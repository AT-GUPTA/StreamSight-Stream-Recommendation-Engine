1. People who are new to the Gundam video games and are looking to start somewhere or who are coming in from other strategy games

2. People who bought G Generation Genesis and are interested in what changed (spoilers: nothing at the basic, mechanical level, but a lot of the finer details have been swapped around; more on that in a bit)


For those people who are new to the Gundam games or are coming in from other turn based strategy titles like XCOM, Phoenix Point, Jagged Alliance, Fire Emblem, and others, welcome! This right here is the latest entry to the SD Gundam G Generations lineup of games. Some things to keep in mind while you're here:

--This game covers events and has mobile suits/characters from the After Colony, Cosmic Era, Anno Domini, and Post Disaster timelines (if you're confused by that, [i]welcome to the Gundam franchise;[/i] basically these are alternate timelines that are, for all intents and purposes, independent of each but still part of the overall franchise). However, don't go in expecting a 1:1 blow-by-blow recreation of each series; think of the stages and campaigns of this game as more of a ""Greatest Hits"" album of each show; they'll hit the major story beats, but won't go into any finer detail than that. 

--This game was made [i]before[/i] Witch from Mercury was a thing, so unfortunately you can't have Sueletta make-a the spaghetta. 

--There are TONS of mobile suits in this game, especially from the weirder/more obscure reference books that were only sold to five people and were only available at some niche convention somewhere in Timbuktu. If you're [i]that[/i] kind of turbo nerd, welcome to your nirvana.  

--You don't get to pick apart/mix and match your mobile suits. Sorry, but this isn't that type of game; you'll want the Gundam Breaker line if you want that sort of customization. However, you [i]can[/i] upgrade/modify your suits' and pilots' stats, so you can definitely build out certain characters to be absolute monsters in certain situations, like having a close combat blender in a mobile suit specialized for getting up close and personal with another character basically becoming Simo Haya acting as long range support. There's tons of flexibility on offer; ya just gotta not be afraid to experiment. 

--There is no ""god combo"" in terms of pilot/suit/skill combinations. All builds are viable, even the goofy ones that require months to setup. All suits, therefore, are roughly comparable to each other in terms of power; what sets them apart is their intended playstyles. 

--You have two primary stats: HP and EN. HP is self explanatory. EN acts as your mana; you use it to activate attacks. 

--Suits are unlocked via what's called ""Development;"" basically, once you level up your suit enough, you can ""upgrade"" it into a new suit. This is how you primarily unlock a large majority of the suits. 

--This game can be kinda grindy if you're the type of person who wants to 100% Full Clear No Savescum it, espiecally if you're looking to unlock every suit in the game. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

--This game isn't really mouse and keyboard friendly; it's more geared towards controllers. You can definitely use the keyboard to navigate the menus and play the game, but using the mouse isn't recommended. 

--Goat Logan [i]is[/i] him. Trust the GOAT.



For the people coming over from Genesis...

--You can import custom BGM. Now you can see Heero Yuy waste fools while The Hamster Dance blares out your speakers! And you can set which tunes play for which weapon animations!

--None of the licensed/original OPs are in this game; you'll have to import it via the Custom BGM options. So, no, the game doesn't come with TM Revolution's Ignited or Zips, nor does it come with JUST-COMMUNICATION. 

--You can now mix and match skills for your pilots for capital, as well as manually modify their stats. 

--Designing new suits no longer uses up the two component suits; the designed suit gets added to the Production List. 

--Created characters can now have faces instead of hidden eyes. 

--There are subtitles for the battle animations. 

--You can enhance/level up your suits outside of combat (you may have always been able to do this; it's been awhile since I played Genesis). 

--You can limit break suits and characters (ie you can go past the level cap of 99 if you pay enough capital to do so). Doing so will help unlock more passive ability slots.

--You can't swap between variations of the same character once you unlock those variations; you have to scout each one. 

--There are no unique battle animations exclusive to canonical suit/pilot combinations. 

--Some of the campaigns are SUPER short (looking at you, Endless Waltz!).  

--There is only one save file available. 

--You can send out teams to go on Group Dispatches; these are similar to the Dispatch Missions from Metal Gear Solid Peacewalker and MGSV, though they aren't multiplayer.

--Goat Logan is [i]still[/i] him. You can continue trusting the GOAT.

I still have some suggestions for future installments, but I also realize that I'm talking at a monolith, and not really to people. Kinda. Publisher/developer relationships can be really weird sometimes.

First thing, the strategy elements are really only present in what I consider the ""early game"". This is the point where many of the pilots, units, and modifications are still locked, and you don't have a morbillion credits just laying around. A practical example of this state is pre-completion of every scenario, which means pre-Hell difficulty, and pre-final scenario. I don't really know how the game could address this for the late-game without also ruining the whole appeal of the late-game, at least for me.

Mid-game and late-game aren't really distinct from one-another in terms of what you have, but rather what you're doing. You should have most of the unlocks available for purchase by mid-game, but you'll definitely have them by late-game if you've been completing quests. Mid-game is where you're still playing the munchkin, and you're fielding the top pilots in the strongest MS' to get mad loot on the hardest difficulties. Late-game (my personal favorite) is when you've already got most of the stuff sitting idly in your inventory, and you get to play Gundam fashion souls. Go ahead and put Trieze Kushrenada in the Gundam Bael, and Fon Spaak in the Gundam Astaroth Origin. Late-game is where you've got the resources in reserve to start crafting your dream team of pilots and MS, and where you realize that almost everyone in the game has voicelines for activating Trans Am. This stage of the game is fun for just seeing what voice lines the developers thought to include, and what kinds of character interactions you can prompt.

That's actually something I'd love to see expanded on in further entries: not just character interactions for pilots in the same timeline, but cross-timeline interactions. Gai Murakumo, Ali al-Saachez, and the Yuhana twins are all mercenaries for different reasons, and have wildly different personalities; what kind of character actions might occur if you assigned them to the same squad? That's probably a super unrealistic expectation for future installments, from a writing and voice acting perspective, but it'd add hours of neat stuff to explore once all the tactical stuff has been exhausted.

To that end, I'd also like to see some of the second-string characters become fully recruitable. They don't need to have as many (if any) interactions as the big characters do, but the rebels from stage ""Traitor A-13"" have portraits, battle quips, stats, and a full list of skills that don't get used anywhere, because they're not recruitable. And for some reason, Miguel Aiman is recruitable, but not these guys?

EDIT: I almost forgot a huge thing. Unique skills are mostly garbage in this. The two really standout ones are ""Lightning Count"" which just gives a +1 movement to almost anything because the activation requirements are so low, and ""Gundam Meister"" which causes you to start each stage with higher-than-normal morale. A lot of the ""unique"" skills are just reskins of other existing skills, or just don't offer much in the way of bonuses. ""Operation Meteor"" is just ""Dauntless Courage 1"", ""Vengeance"" is just ""Counterattack 2"", ""Spatial Sense"" is just ""Awakening 2"", ""Master Swordsman"" is just ""Melee Power 1"", etc. ""Grim Reaper"" is actually unique, insofar as its effects go: bonus melee crit chance when fighting 1-on-1, but it's not all that useful since 1-on-1 fights need a lot more work to be staged, and you're honestly just better off sinking more points into a unit's offensive abilities than relying on crits.

Really, anything to bolster the end-game stage where everything is unlocked, and now you get to play dress-up with different Pilot/MS and team setups, would be an absolute win in my book.",1587832479,1704567698,True,2,0,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,False

The available campaigns are simplified retellings of their anime counterparts without any notable flare, with the combat maps and encounters being flat and vaguely repellent in design. They went for a pseudo-pixelated style that looks simply undercooked, and when battles are initiated the animations look decent but rapidly become drawn out and repetitive. I was in the middle of a Gundam Wing rewatch and the entire time I was playing the early missions I just kept thinking to myself ""I should just get back to watching the show."" 

I admit I threw in the towel quickly on this one as its not something I usually do and often give a game as fair a shake as possible, but if you are someone like me who sees this and thinks this is going to be anything more than just mindless turnbased combat with flashy fanservice in mind, pass on this.

This is not a good game.  To start, the presentation is deceiving.  The videos you see on the Steam page are either cutscenes or the small action animations you see after inputting an attack, while the actual tactical layer you'll spend most of your time looking at is some very static and bland spritework.  Admittedly, the action scenes are well done, but they're so long that you'll start skipping after seeing them twice.

The visuals could be forgiven, except the game also has very little tactical gameplay.  Stages are wide open with little terrain and your units overpower the enemies rather handily - there's even an option to have all your units move up automatically and attack whatever ends up nearest to them.  Half the time the enemy units skip their turn and stand around waiting to die.

Compounding this is the almost complete lack of onboarding.  You pick a Gundam series from Wing, SEED, Orphans, or 00 and get a short story introduction, followed by a set of talking heads that do little to cover the plot of the featured show thanks to the brief dialogue and poor translation.  I've seen Gundam Wing several times and it still took a bit to catch what was happening.  Then the game throws you into a battle where you're already controlling some 10-15 units, each with their own Mobile Suits, skills, and weapons that haven't been explained.  Link-Up Attacks, Potential, Awakening, Support Attacks, Support Defense, three types of actions to take when you get attacked, and so on.

You can take break from fighting to tour the hangar menu where you'll find you already have twenty pilots recruited, a whole list of mobile suits you can build, the ability to combine or upgrade suits into new types (that the game won't tell you the outcome of until you do it at least once), modifications and skills to equip, and more.  If you're like me, you'll question what the point of it all is because you've auto-battled through the missions so far without resistance.

I really wanted to like this game.  I love the source material, but after a few hours playing and some looking at outside information to see if there was something to look forward to, I had to drop it.  As I understand, it's less of a tactical RPG with mobile suits and more of a stat-grind where you get to watch your favorite Gundams repeatedly mangle enemies.

Honestly, if you want to bash things with Mobile Suits, you'll have more fun grabbing SD Gundam Battle Alliance.",1696759175,1696759488,False,2,0,0.468434512615203857,0,True,False,False

Over all its ok gundam game, its not bad at all but not amazing either. It is one of those games you want to play on a mobile device while pooping but not on PC. The whole reason that kept me going was just for the sake of those grindy achievement, but that's really it, not out of enjoyment.
It crashes every single time so far when you start a mission for the first time after launching the game.
Missions are kinda meh, most players probably finish their favorite series and move on.
but what these Japanese games love to do is to make un-skippable sht that literally no one has asked for and that sht is annoying af.
When you finish the game, a huge credits roll up that cant be sped up or skipped, it lasts way longer than 15 mins, I couldn't wait that long with just names rolling up. Want to quit anyway? You lose your savings of that last stage and you gonna have to restart the whole credits again. The person who made the decision to not let us skip or speed up thinks they made such a masterpiece that it will have standing ovation for the whole credits instead of realizing none of us gives a eff, if we liked any voice actor from Gundam series, we would've known it by now. You might say oh maybe it is just a feature they forgot to include, well you sweet naive summer child, guess what? They included a pause option during the credits to let you observe any cast so clearly it is intentional. Don't have the DLCs? No problem, enjoy that extra credits anyway, like EFF EFFING OFF JESUS EFFING CHRIST!

I admit I hesitated getting into to the SD Gundam series due to the art style seeming to appeal more to a younger audience, but I was pleasantly surprised to find myself forgetting about it entirely. 

I will say there is a learning curve here, and some mistranslations that can cause some confusion. Though thankfully the community around this game has quite the number resources to navigate the initial foray into the game, as well as the translation errors. 

Graphics: 
Not setting any new precedents here but that shouldn't stop you. The combat animations are quite stunning and do justice to the various gundams/series involved. Definitely a solid showing unless you're someone who constantly seeks the highest possible graphical fidelity.

Music:
They may not have every single track and score from each series but their selection is nostalgic and delightful. I'm a big fan of music and this is something I was quite surprised by in Cross Rays. I expected and entirely original soundtrack, and while there are new pieces I found I was more drawn to sounds from Wing and Astray that I remember and enjoy still.

Gameplay:
Can get a bit stale from time to time, however, they have a number quests and challenges for each stage that may push you to step outside of your preferred playstyle. Additionally, there are dispatch missions alongside the campaign where you send out units to complete a mission while you progress the story. These don't necessarily take away from the main game, but some of them read like they would have been fun missions to do myself. The rewards from these dispatch missions aid you directly for both the campaign and future dispatch missions so the loop is satisfying, albeit time consuming.

Story:
If you know the story beats from your favorite franchise such as Wing, Seed, or Iron Blooded Orphans then you know what to expect from the story. That said, knowing what's coming doesn't work against the game or gameplay in the slightest. It definitely does an appropriate job of making you feel the stakes of each battle. 

Controls:
Simple and to the point. Customizable and otherwise unremarkable which for me is a good thing. 

Overall:
If you've been wanting to play a new or different gundam game while waiting for the continuation of another game series *cough Dynasty Warriors Gundam 5 plz* or to scratch the gundam itch this is a fine place to do it. I have around 230 hours and while I'm close to 100%, I still see myself playing after I have all the pilots and Mobile Suits collected.",1691980881,1691980881,True,5,0,0.581749081611633301,0,True,False,False

Been ages that i last played a G generation genre but i'm a sucker for super robot wars games and when i played on g-generation F in psx, man, it was totally enjoyable even if  i dont have any idea what the japanese characters are (thanks to early internet sites providing some hint and some community back then) 

so, my opinion with cross rays -- IT SUCKS. here's why:
1. limited customization of mechs
2. it feels the game revolves around with GRIND gameplay
3. since i witnessed the g generation zero F with ps one, the mechanics are so simple in crossrays. if I didn't purchased the season pass and the other add ons, i will throw away this game and i highly discourage you getting this.
4. i'm just playing for the sake of seeing or completing mechs, the interactivity or should i say, the feeling of achievements for the game is ""work"" not fun. 
5. on no.3, i miss the days you have a base to customize and upgrade. 
6. dispatch missions- what the hell are those? i want to play those missions and see the stories behind them. not just a sort of dispatch and wait scenario

over all, i was disappointed how this franchise went down and a lot of series i don't like (a lot of gundam seed, sorry for the fans but i feel they are just slapped here as fillers, why they put newer series like the witch from mercury and hathaway since  we have a season pass?

For those who are saying the game was ok, i think they haven't played much of the games, it really felt if you're on a budget and there was no sale, you'll get disappointed getting this on base game. I almost bought this in a hype when it was released. but i was surprised bandai went down and forced this game to us fans. i will finish the game and try to swallow this but this is becoming laborous.

1. Isn't super difficult, I play on the ""Extra"" difficulty and typically clear without losses.
2. Missions can run a little long, this may be because I play on ""Extra"" but the extra xp is nice at least

PROS-Would recommend if you're a fan of Gundam. It is a fun game and entertaining seeing how other mobile suits perform in different eras. The game is a ""tactical"" RPG, with tactical stretched to its limits. It is more move your overpowered unit to an enemy and watch it smash them apart. Every suit has a unique attack cinematic for all the different attacks the suit has, so that is fun to watch for the first couple of times. The game allows you to pick what timeline to fight in (Gundam Wing, Seed, Orphans, Gundam 00, no orginal Gundam however) and what suits to bring.  From there you partake in pivotal moments in the series.

NEGATIVES- Character creation is bare bones, with only you being able to choose their name, birthday and outfit. Their face being covered by a shadow so Bandai didn't have to put in faces to choose from. Does get repetitive.  The store page for the game only shows attack cinematic, not actual game play, so a little deceiving.

Gameplay is fairly simple but fun especially if you enjoy Gundam / Mecha in general while also providing a large selection of Units to choose from. 

Pros:
- A good alternative to watching the anime featured because the game covers most of the important plot point in the featured series
- Large selections of Cast and Units to choose from
- Battle animations are mostly enjoyable and cool
- Side Stories are mostly great and introduced me to some enjoyable entries namely IBO Gekko, Seed Astray, and G-Units
- Gameplay is simple and fun
- Custom BGM

Cons:
- Could be a bit repetitive for some people
- IBO Gekko Story felt unfinished (which is a shame because I really enjoyed that entry)

If u r Gundam fans, u must have it.
Do not fear much about the battle system, just keep reading and trying some tactics.
Sit and Enjoy building your own squads with your favourite mobile suits mother ships and mobile armours.

Gundam Wing series is my preference so I mainly use units from this series such Wing zero, Heavyarms and Tallgeese etc. 

After 100+ hours play
Battle system is not hard to understand and u will get exciting when apply full scale atk like 9 units atk 9 unit and warship attack.
Building squads are not hard u can get much money from dispatch and farming in stages
Game difficulty is not high like previous SD G gen series. When u understand battle system thoroughly, u can win stages like u flip your hands
Challenge and secret missions are tricky, it need creative thinking to complete. So just open your mind and think differently.

At 200 hour playtime
I got many mods from completing challenges and secrets. my enhanced unite lv are at 50+. So, my team can deal with Extra hard stages. Playing style at normal difficulty are the same as Extra hard. You can use the same method that passing normal stages for passing extra hard stage too. Because enemy AI walk the same pace in all difficulty. 
At Extra hard stage. AI will atk u by group atk. If your gundams do not have HP 15K+ or can not dodge their atk, u will die so fast.
Playing Extra hard give u more moneys and better pilot mods and some rewards need to complete Extra hard lv such as Gundam Lupas Rex Limitor OFF and Gundam OO ELS Quanta.

I am quite satisfied about this game and look forward to the next one.

G Generation wars spanned just about every gundam series you could think of from the first all the way up to the first season of Gundam 0 and had units from all of those timelines. Overworld had less story coverage, and while it had a smaller roster it still covered units from all of the main titles and more popular spin-offs, it also boasted an original story and  fairly refined mechanics.

While cross-rays is not a bad experience on the whole, if you have played overworld you would most probably find yourself frustrated with the reduced unit roster, lack of any meaningfull skills for ship crew besides the captain, the inability to unlock custom variants for production. certain units, parts and skills being locked behind afk missions, the existence of said afk missions. Most ships simply being reskins of other ships.

dissapointing dlc, they give you access to a few characters and units, but no new missions (unless you count the afk missions) and even with all dlc purchased, unit and character roster is still smaller than older games.

most characters are held back in terms of potential due to having their ability slots pre-filled with useless abilities, is seems like 90% of character abilities in this game are useless or marginally usefull at best. 

between the inability to produce custom variants of units and the some of the ability slots of characters being pre-filled, it can be frustrating trying to make your ideal roster.
Building your teams out of your favourite pilots in your favourite mechs is one of the biggest draws of this game, and so removing custom variants from production and limiting characters potential really works against that.",1686121844,1686121844,False,3,0,0.55190807580947876,0,True,False,False

Much smoother and happier for having DLC too! At 9 hours, I haven't even battled yet, have just been building up my money and leveling up my suits through Dispatches.

Animations are fun but CAN be skipped if you get bored after the first billion times you see them.

Do get the DLC, they are great for getting some suits that are otherwise NOT available in your production list. Mobile Suit collecting is definitely a sub-genre of this game.

This is NOT how I started my original play through though. That one was much more organic and I went in with only minimal knowledge and a skeleton crew of mobile suits. It was more organic in that I battled and leveled up suits concurrently. That was fine until I lost one of my favorite mobile suits, nearly lost my sole battleship, and had others that were short on energy (EN) that I hadn't put into via points upgrades so that made battles frustrating. 

Thus this time around, I'm waiting a bit to play any of the storylines because I want to level up some suits first. You can play this game either way. I just want to feel like an unstoppable juggernaut of mobile suit slaying tactical mayhem so I'm doing this method. I have mobile suits and characters mapped out for upgrades from start to end game level and it's marvelous!

This is a great game if you're into turn based strategic game play. The game also goes through the literal story lines of its listed titles. I only know because I had recently watched Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans with a friend and they pointed out that there were literal lines word for word from the anime in the game, and I could care less. It let me relive those scenes and immerse myself into those scenarios with my own decisions.

The animations are unapologetic and over the top, and I love it every time. From the super long cut scene attacks to a grunt unit exploding in glorious fashion, I would turn it back on from time to time just to watch it play out.

For those that like to/want to 100% the game, you don't need the DLC to do so. Having it only assists you in getting to 100% faster.

This game was worth the full price tag and its DLC. The biggest con I can say is that this game can be quite grindy, but honestly...once you complete one of the mid to long scenarios with your team of units you're good to go to just complete the game.",1676510888,1676510888,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Problem 1 or rather the biggest Problem: it takes to F*cking long. From the 230 hours i have at least 200 are just Completion of the Main Missions Taking you through the Storys of the Cosmic Era, After Colony, Anno Domini and Post Calamity Stoys including Mangas. 1 Mission can take up to 1 Hour to be Completed for a Few Reasons.

Reason 1: The games animations, on the Strategy Screen, take to long even when you skip Battle animations.
Reason 2: Upon completion of the Main objective of the Mission the objective becomes KILL EVERYTHING where the Games Spawns A F*ckton of enemies you need to Kill them all on top of all enemies still remaining on the Battlefield(something older games didnt do,at least to such an extend)
Reason 3: The Battle animations although you can skip them each Animation takes a certain amount of time, even something as simple as firing Vulcans....... Yeah, but older G Generations games did that as well so it dont count that much. The New 3D animations look good but eventually you saw them all and also enough even as a Gundam fan.

This makes the Missions not really Hard but rather annoying. In earlyer games grinding up your MS and Pilots was necessary at Certain points. In this game you would still need to do that if not for th fact that the game gives you""Welcome Materials"" that you can sell for more than enough Funds to get the best MS and also Level up your Pilots, making it so that your Team can 1 Shot everything that isnt enemies from the Final Stage. Making the game just Boring. You even get more ""Welcome Materials"" when you buy the DLC making the situation even Better. 
OH also the DLC! The DLC add something called Dispatch Missions you Essentially choose 1 of your 4 Crew give them away for Up to 12 hours so they can Complete the Progress Bar of the Dispatch Mission the amount of Percentage increases based on certain Factors and Criteriors.

Now a few Positives. First the Animations they're Good like Really good every Gundam fan will Probaby Wet themselves Seeing them.
The Way the SD MS look is also great.
There is much to Collect it takes time but if your willing you can have your Gundam dream Team.
The Character Creator is also ok its like it was in Older installments nothing special but i mean this ain't no RPG so its Sufficent.

Overall this Game like most New Gundam games fell slow and Cluncky and is in my Opinion not worth it.",1675039798,1675040300,False,2,0,0.498087227344512939,0,True,False,False

The raid group attacks are pretty cool and nice that this can run on a potato PC if you skip battle animations (nice 3d) or lower resolution/effects.

There is a lot of depth to differentiate from Super Robot Wars as well (great $15 sale when I bought too).  I liked the slight character customization and buying a lot of different mobile suits; it takes time to understand everything with all these options.  For example, waiting an additional battle for a vastly better one is a balance issue let alone if you permanently lose 1 in battle though the pilot survives.

The warship mechanic to deploy is pretty cool to sortie everyone out.  It's only 4 units, so manually deploying each isn't too time-consuming, though the vehicles ridden have to manually be finalized.

Pretty decent customization and a massive number of suits/armours/warships and pilots to pick from to create your dream teams. You can have pretty much any character in any suit that is in any of the four storylines. 
Attempts to bring strategic options such as two different team types which affect how you play but the raid strike option is so powerful it makes most strategies moot.
The stories are conveyed in quite heavily in a visual novel style and often comes in huge chunks but can be easily skipped with a press of the button.
Presentation can be a mixed bag. Maps often feel flat and empty, as if your units are just moving around on a jpeg, but the fight animations are well done (and again, easily skipped for brevity's sake).

选这个游戏是因为虽然喜欢机战，但是机战里大部分人不能自由换机体。拉克丝戏份又少。而这游戏的机体和人物数量还是挺多的，加上DLC还有G、倒A、复国等一系列。不少人物还有不同版本。

玩这个游戏就是为了能用喜欢的角色么，所以上来就打SEED系，入手拉克丝就马上就放到一线。SEED的拉克丝开最强的量子ELS，SEED-D的开掉毛。还挺喜欢她的台词的


这游戏关卡设计的还是不错的，开荒SEED的时候每一关都很紧张要尽最大力去达到剧情目标，要么限时要么保护NPC。哪怕后期机体等级高随便打的时候，00一些挑战真不是那么简单达成的。部分图都是只能用NPC机体。W那里MD机体没有水瓶座高达把他们都瘫痪掉也不是那么好弄。

就是大部分关卡后期都要全灭敌人，敌人数量又多还会随着剧情增援。打起来不免比较繁琐，当然后期一回合用联攻+支援能消灭30+个敌人，一般几个回合就能结束。一个机体打死敌人是可以再动的，有特殊技能还能增加再动次数。

比起战舰我还是更喜欢游击队，调配起来更自由。就是前期不能满编上阵，得把一队一些人放二队去。

剧情还算原汁原味，不仅尊重原作，连原作的槽点都保持了。SEED-D换主角，铁血的狗血结局，W的装13都能通过游戏感受到。观星者、华尔兹这些不错的故事通过游戏也能感受到魅力。可惜就是很多对话没有配音。

这是通关时候的队伍，一队队长是DLC的原创AI，声音挺女神的。其他是拉克丝、玛琉、阿莲比、克鲁泽、赛莲妮（观星者女主）、芙蕾和W GUNIT的露娜。基本是心目中最喜欢的一批了。露娜剧情里挺叫人怜惜的。选玛琉是因为声线，可以YY成美里。SEED-D的拉克丝去带二队。

俩拉克丝分开是因为在一起联攻时候会有点违和。

二队不那么讲究，除了拉克丝其他人经常换

战斗场面是真的炫酷，人物都有台词和特色。像芙蕾的声线和台词就很棒，杀气腾腾又娇气十足。所以虽然觉得颜值不是顶级但一直放一队。

比起来拉克丝的颜值是真硬，也就阿莲比可以一战。能力数值，击杀也是第一

最终关难打在四周的敌人灭队后就会刷新的一波，而且我方机体还不能进入敌人的腹地，近战机体都不太好用。要完成任务还不能过早击杀小BOSS。基本是4边贴着边，利用联攻的射程优势一波波清理，1队比较强的两侧也可以用机体杀敌。尽量做到一回合打掉大部分敌人但是不灭队留一个，等下一关再打掉。这样可以用尽可能多的火力把新刷出来的敌人打残而不是给它们全队进攻的机会。小BOSS放后面杀。此外一二队适当混编这样两队联攻都可以攻击到四周的敌人。

打完全部敌人后清小BOSS，接下来再打掉四个新的小BOSS，最终BOSS联攻可以秒杀，天照真帅啊。


看了下玩了快90个小时，感谢这游戏给我的那么多快乐时光，特别给我机会用拉克丝大杀四方啊，之后就慢慢派遣刷级了。",1666375813,1666375813,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can get a lot from playing this game and i can say this game isn't as forgiving at times as well as generous at the same time as the previous titles or Super Robot Wars series.

The Good points to this game is that you can practically learn some of the story of the few series they have included as well as there many different routes of the MS development and difficulty is self explanatory as for a beginner it can be quite difficult but you'll get the hang of it. Benefits to using the dispatch when you are not playing the game and can come back to later to see it be complete or just farm skip time tickets which older games did not have. The ability to abuse it will make somethings quite easy especially for Capital which will make it easy to buy units / battleships. Animation is great and the chance to scout actual characters is great too. Especially the unique voice lines.

The only minor issue i had with this game was the save game option as putting other teams on dispatch or starting new mission would clear your previous data as it should keep it unless you cover that save slot but it isn't a big issue unless you don't save often on turns and have to redo the entire mission which is normal. That some Gundams are only obtainable through putting teams in dispatch and getting high percentage and repeat till its 100% if it isn't already rather than including their series or missions based on them. Can be pricey, so waiting for sales is also an option.

Overall it is a great experience and you have a lot of Gundams to get as well as develop into or even exchange into but definitely worth the time if you have either the time or patience to feel the wrath of this game especially knowing that if your units die in battle, they are gone forever until you buy or re develop again which is a start from 0 and Great place to start if you like or want to get into these style of games. I personally enjoyed it, had some moments that died with the unit in battle.

... when it works PROPERLY.

I cannot fully explain what the actual fuck is causing it, but this game refuses to use the Steam Cloud for it's save data, and as a result continuously eats up more and more memory until the game itself begins to CREATE bugs and glitches due to insufficient space. Examples include:

1. Freezing the screen during battle animations without crashing the game, rendering it unplayable without a restart. These freezes only grow more frequent as more data is taken up.
2. Randomly deleting produced mobile suits as a deleterious way of freeing up space (This happened with one of my absolute favorite mobile suits, Gundam Barbatos Lupus Rex).
3. Resetting mission progress to make room for more data.
4. Resetting acquired mobile suit DESIGNS so that they must be researched through developing mobile suits AGAIN.
5. Deleting CUSTOM PILOTS TO MAKE MORE ROOM FOR MORE DATA.

You can likely see where this is going. The game actively refusing to use cloud storage for save data means that it cannot function properly without literal TERABYTES of memory dedicated solely to just this ONE, SINGLE GAME. And there are a plethora of other issues I didn't mention.

If you value your data storage space, stay far, FAR away until they manage to fix this issue. Though seeing as this data-eating nightmare released quite a while ago, that's an optimistic thought at BEST.

TLDR: 
Pro: 
1) High resolution graphics, 

2) Probably 3D rendered battle animation, (I suspect it is rendered in 3D, but they are always displayed in fixed, on-rail animation, so, well...) 

3) Finally, in languages I fully understand, can enjoy the stories. (I have limited understanding in Japanese)

That's it.

Con: 
1) EXTREMELY EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFULLY COUNTER INTUITIVE MOUSE CONTROL. Only morons will program it like this in year 202x. Bandai Namco's programmers must have been programming this game using gamepad with soft keyboard. Yeah, the one they used in the consoles to allow players input My Characters name of this game.

2) Units are still presented with pre-rendered still image in gallery and information screen. Opportunity missed

3) Using a very ancient and very dislike-able system. I can't recall which version it is, but it must have been very old, like PS1 or PS2 era that used this very painful system and later got ditched in newer versions, for reasons we all know why.

Full review (Or, full rant):
I have been a huge fan of the SDGGG series, and have been playing this game since the PS1 versions. However The one I liked most is the SDGGG World/Over World, so I'll be comparing this game to that.

Instead of using the tested and proven SDGGG World/Over World system, for reasons I couldn't fathom, the developers of this game chose to use this system. It is very confusing in the leveling-up of units and it is very painful to grind for levels to get more MS. Over World has already have a very mature and fully evolved system, I just can't understand why they want to make this PC version so painful to play.

The Mouse Control.... I was thrilled to learn that this game has full mouse control. It's a PC game after all... However, 10 seconds in in my first play of stage 1, I started to feel very uneasy about the mouse control. 

First of all When you click to select a unit, the screen will center on the unit, this is fine, but the problem is, you WILL HAVE TO CLICK ON IT AGAIN TOO BRING UP THE MENU. So when the screen centered on a unit, your mouse is not pointing on the unit anymore!! If you do a double click to try bring up the menu, you will be clicking wildly on another space and the game will try to center on that space, and so on. This is especially painful when selecting a Warship, since it takes up multiple space and unless you always click on the EXACT CENTER of the ship when it is in dead center of screen, you will never be able to call up the ship's menu. And since the space you clicked on the ship, while the game will highlight the square, it is covered by the ship itself. So a pure mouse user will be very frustrated in this game.

The reason of this is the developer is just too lazy to program a proper mouse control for the PC. They just take the console's gamepad control, mapped them to mouse clicks and that's it. 

WAKE UP CALL TO BANDAI NAMCO programmers: PC Games, especially with MOUSE CONTROL, do not work like gamepad controls. At least test play your game in Keyboard/Mouse control, since you are releasing it on PC.

Why not program it as a proper mouse controlled game: When player clicked on a unit, screen centering is fine, as long as you show the menu a the mouse click event, not requiring another click to make the menu show up. I understand it is from the console control scheme, where you press the L/R button while holding Square button (I'm referring to PSP controls here), then press the Circle button to call up the menu. 

But simply mapping a click on a unit as Square+L/R and then another click to match the Circle button to call up menu is just very counter intuitive for a PC game. 

And all that I have just described so lengthy, is just one single aspect of the cumbersome mouse control, it presents in many other mouse control due to lazy mapping of the gamepad button.

Also, since the game already have all the 3D models of the MS/Warships, why oh why do people at Bandai Namco still presents the MS/Warships gallery with still images? I really hope I can view all the MS/Units in full 3D, i.e. I can look at them at any angle to admire the full mechanical designs. I believe a 3D model, even fully textured (not that I'd say the MS in the battle animations have very detailed texture, they looked like mostly comprised of flat polygons), would still be smaller than a high resolution still picture, no? At least you don't have to include a 3D model + texture and also a high resolution still image for the gallery, and you could cut the work of needing to render the still images and stuffed them in the game files.

The only reason why I haven't refunded the game is, I just want to know what the story is about and to fully understand what the characters have been yapping about, all the time, in all the SDGGG games I have played.

Before anyone jump in and yell: GO WATCH THE ANIME, I'm not very interested in watching anime. All I'm interested in is Gunpla, and SDGGG games. Gunpla has been becoming too expensive for me, so I'd expect to be able to admire the MS in this game.

And, no, I'm not playing this game with a gamepad. Not until I'm totally desperate (When the extremely peas poor mouse control finally defeated me)...",1656333033,1656333033,False,1,2,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is not your usual action packed fast paced game where you blaze through stages in 10 minutes tops, at least in the early game. It's slow and you have to plan out your movements and units attacks accordingly to optimise your strategy to fit the situation. You also have to manage a ton of units on the field at once. 
The game is surprisingly indepth for what you can do such as developing units, the proper stats and pilot/unit combinations and all that but after a few hours you'll get the hang of it.

The gameplay loop seems a little complicated at first but it becomes pretty simple as you settle into it, and you can chain together some pretty fun combos and group attacks using allied suits or warships. 

The game can get a bit repetitive though, since most of the missions are relatively similar and retell the anime storylines pretty closely, so you have to sit through a lot of dialogue. Most of the fun probably comes from the ability to mix and match the different suits and pilots (you can beat the crap out of Ali Al-Saachez using Orga Itsuka in the Strike Freedom Gundam, for example), and watch them fight each other in some pretty slick animations that play between attacks. Not a perfect game by any means, but a lot of fun if you're a fan of Gundam and want something with a lot of content to sink your teeth into.

It's wearing fancy looking strategy coat, maybe some cool tactical shades but there's no real substance to the look. Where this game succeeds is pure, uncut fan service injected straight into the veins. This is nothing more than a toybox for fanboys and even a dabbler such as myself can see the appeal.

The complex development systems, the dispatching and the strategic play are all a vehicle to deliver the player new unlocked mechs, pilots, and vehicles. The satisfaction doesn't come from overcoming the challenge, but from earning more toys that you can mix and match into crazy combinations.  
- You want to know how your favorite mech pilot will do as the captain of a warship? You can do that.
- You want bridge bunnies to turn into fighter pilots? You have my Group 04.
- You want mortal enemies to team up into an upstoppable monster tank squad? EZ PZ
- You want an entire player created army? Not a problem

I've barely scratched the surface on the unlocks and I find myself loving every minute of squad building, training and experimenting with different teams. The more useless the team is... the more accurate it is to the lore. You aren't SUPPOSED to create an unstoppable army, and instead do something I've never seen before.

Each chapter of the game has you playing through the various Gundam storylines. We follow the stories of these anime Heroes in their ridiculously OP mechs as they do hero stuff and destroy all their enemies. Do enough cool stuff as this ""Guest"" pilot and they'll get unlocked for your own army.

The player's custom army takes on the role of the nameless NPCs that happened to be around. Anything they destroy takes away from the heroes kills... and your ability to unlock anything. Instead, it becomes a battle to make the Stars of the show shine. You don't want to destroy targets, but to soften them up enough so that Heero can get some epic combos and replicate iconic scenes from the show for even more unlocks.

(It's worth noting that killing an enemy rewards and additional action and this is an extremely fun puzzle)

Everything is balanced so that the NPCs are powerful enough to handle the majority of the threats. As such, all of the custom army building becomes far less important. Even a joke army can run support in most cases and well-designed and equipped army is likely to slow the actual objectives of unlocking the heroes. 

Missions themselves tend to greatly outstay their welcome. A single stage often consists of a long cutscene, a battle, another cutscene, a separate larger battle that can have multiple maps and surprise changes. followed by more cutscenes. On average a single mission lasts between 1 and 2 hours for me. 

The shallow depth and low strategy would be far better paced in a more casual fashion. It's feel much better to split each stage into 2-3 smaller ones to better fit the experience. But at the end of the day, I still enjoy the time I've put into this and could see it easily being 80 hours by the time the core content is complete.

This is why I'm recommending this as a Toy Box but not as a strategy game. There's alot of joy to be found, but its not what I would have expected from the genre.",1652402262,1652402262,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A player who isn't already emotionally invested in one or two of the series on display here may be put off by the early grind, especially if they don't have favorite suits or characters to work towards. Individual battles also drag on far too long given the kind of game this is--I had a level recently that took over two hours to clear, which becomes a barrier to pushing through and investing more time in the game.

With that being said, I have a lot of fun with this game. Putting together dream teams, pairing up characters from different series, and experimenting with different mobile suits is a nerdy pleasure. I especially enjoy the option of powering up lower-tier jobber suits (looking at you, Leo) to keep up with the higher models. It's probably not the optimal way to play but I get bored fielding nothing but OP Gundams. This game is a great way for fans of various shows to experience manga side stories like IBO Gekko or Dual Story: G-Unit. There's a huge amount of content here, though long cutscenes/levels and the grind to get various suits slows things down considerably.

I've attempted to play the previous game in this series on the Switch and can say with absolute certainty that Generation Cross Rays is the better game. It's a shame that all the great Universal Century content isn't here (unless you count Turn A or Reconguista from the DLC), but Generation has so many QOL improvements that reduce grind and make collecting suits and characters so much less tedious. The dispatch missions are a decent alternative to endlessly grinding story missions to level up suits and get money. If some gargantuan sequel game comes along that brings more of the UC content to Steam, here's hoping that it takes its cues from Generation.

I'll probably get Genesis on PS4 if i do bother, but for now this game has left a relatively sour taste in my mouth despite scratching my itch for GGEN Gundam.",1647701248,1647701288,False,1,1,0.472964167594909668,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Missions are long (usually over an hour) and feel satisfying when completed.
- Tons of characters from the series and all of the Gundams to go with them. 
- Character creation. You can create a whole team of your own characters. 
- Every gundam has a list of unique attacks, each with their own battle animation. 
- Battle animations play like you're watching the anime, complete with cuts to the characters yelling out their catchphrases from the cockpit.
- Battle animations and overall gameplay speed are/is heavily customizeable. 
- The story missions have unique game play elements that are fun. (example: a mission may have a war happening on the ground and in the air, and you toggle between the two, and can transfer units with the required abilities between the two) 
- Endless squad customization and strategy possibilities. Every gundam has its own level, stats, and abilities, as does every pilot and you can pair any pilot with any gundam. You have a ton of freedom when it comes to creating your teams. 
 
Cons:
- It's the chibi Gundams instead of the regular ones. (this is the only thing that actually bothers me at all lol)
- You spend a lot of time clicking through menus. Every unit, every move, every turn, its all a menu with several clicks for each action. I know clicking the mouse doesn't sound like a big deal, but these are 1-2 hour long battles with 20 vs. 50+ unit matches, as well as all the time spent organizing and prepping your teams for the mission. Its not the end of the world, but its noticeable. 

I'm not even a fan of the series (nothing against it, just never got into it) and this gives me what I assume is the same excitement fans of the show get from watching it. It's a great game overall. Its not just fire emblem with Gundam, Its Fire Emblem with Gundam but they made everything better somehow.

+ Nearly overwhelming number of mobile suits and armor, and characters despite covering only the non-UC Gundam stories. All have unique detailed animations and dialogue, including special dialogue if you put a pilot in a machine that belonged to them in the stories.
+ The map weapons are a lot of fun to set up and use.
+ You can create your own characters in the game.
+ Unlocking machines and characters through design and development mechanic is highly addictive.
+ The ""raid"" groups that can be added to missions without a carrier mothership are a nice touch which match nicely with several Gundam stories like Wing and some missions of 00.
+ There are plenty of UI improvements over the previous game G Generation Genesis - such as being able to quickly view the profile (i.e. sort of like a wiki) for characters and machines from the stats page, English localization for all dialogue, easily finding unmoved units on the map etc.
+ Weapon based variations of mechs are now considered as the same mech with different loadout options. This removes some clutter.

- Having different versions of the same character does not make sense to me. Instead these should have been part of leveling up.
- The turn based tactics part is not very compelling. Most missions are either too easy or too hard based on which groups you are adding as sorties and what difficulty you are selecting. There is no metric to compare their relative strengths. It is mostly like a puzzle game about stringing together extra moves, support attacks balanced with energy, with the focus being on the animated actions of the various mechs and their various weapons. 
- Some nuances of the Gundams and other mechs are lost in the generic way non-map weapons are implemented.
- Missions can sometimes have a crazy number of enemies and feel like a chore.
- A bit overpriced.

Offers almost all the non-UC(universal century) Gundam units from mecha moblie suits, tank, planes, transformers and capital ships from those anime series WITH the added DLC.

The gameplay, animations, customisation and music is great. It uses your head to solve issues if you haven't grinded the lvl of your units too much and tests your knowledge of the series if you watched those animes before. It also allows you to customise your own pilots and add your own music to the animations, I personally prefer adding Sabaton's album.

The only downsides are as mentioned that there are no universal century suits, so no Unicorn gundam, no Amuro, no Guntank, no Char and his Zaku(except for those Zaku inspired Zaku Warrior's from Gundam Seed Destiny). Also except for random encounters and (secret maps unlocked by beating every series campaign) every map will strictly follow the story and only feature units from that specific series so if you watched that anime, you generally know what you're going to face 90% of the time. Reducing the game to a ""play as the protagonists plus your added non-cannon crew of fan fiction"". Also the DLC are expensive and generally only add units/pilots/music to the game, no new maps.

It is easyer to play if you have a PS4 controller with a USB cable(Also good for Monster Hunter World).

If you like tactical games, FF tactics and games like that, this is along that line of thinking but a little more complicated. This is because of the meta-game outside the scenarios where you develop your mobile suits and pilots.
You can evolve them (along the lines of Pokemon-type games) to make new mobile suits and develop your very own Gundam army that you can use in any of the scenarios from across so many different series.

It's Gundam heaven.

The difficulty level is changeable, and so far I like to play on hard mode (and that's not even the hardest mode).
The animated battles are still fun to watch even hours later, and it's fun to see whether or not you land your attacks in a critical situation or dodge enemy attacks when you are low on HP.

This basically is a turn-based strategy game that focuses on, at the time of release in late 2019, the last 25 years of the Gundam franchise. In anime series/timeline terms, that's starting with 1995's worldwide breakout smash hit Gundam Wing up  until 2019's Iron-Blooded Orphans. It mostly focuses on 3 particular titles and their side stories-Wing, SEED and 00, with 1994's oddball Street Fighter-like Mobile Fighter G Gundam and other side stories thrown in as bonus content if you get the Deluxe Edition and Expansion Pack DLC. Also, if you are expecting the actual SD Gundam, which was kiddie-themed but insanely funny, it's not here. SD refers to all the MS/MA being rather tiny in scale.
For what it is, the game looks and sounds great, everything looks like it did in the anime and you'll recognize some familiar music from each title if you've seen them (no vocals on some themes though). Once you figure out controls it gets easy, but it's complex at first given the vast depth of options (you can play with both a keyboard/mouse or a controller) so plan on spending your first few games getting used to them. The gameplay is turn-based, some stages have optional missions you can do first for extra rewards, while main battles consist of an event sequence then an interlude before the rest of the battle unfolds-usually you have to destroy everything but sometimes you have to stay alive or get to a certain spot on the map. 3 difficulty levels plus trying to make units available for production means endless grinding.
There also are optional Group Dispatch missions, these require internet because some missions change on a daily basis (no co-op or PVP though). But despite the online factor there is no multiplayer.
In the long run how much you'll enjoy this comes down to how much you like Gundam and if you're willing to put in hundreds of hours to grind for all the achievements. If you're into the anime, get the Digital Deluxe Pack and the Expansion Pack DLC when it's on a good sale.

So for starters, the game does a great job of easing you into everything. I don't feel like there is a lot of hand holding which a lot of games suffer from these days. It does a good job of explaining the mechanics. The battles are really fun to watch at first but immediately afterwards, you will get tired of pacing of the battles. Thankfully there is an option to cut the battle animations so that the battles proceed more smoothly. Even better than that, there is an option to activate the animations at the press of a button, in case its one you have never seen before. I really enjoy that the developers put so much effort into respecting the player's time.  There are a lot of ways you can customize your fleet. I enjoy how much attention to detail went into making this game. There is an insane amount of replayability, and it eases you into it so well, so even though I have only 4 hours in, I still feel as though I have made progress with my Mobile Suits.

I have spent 80 hours in this game and i only did the IBO missions..I have never been so hooked into a turn-based strategy game since DISGAE 4.

The story telling in this game is really solid and fun..You will feel like watching the anime and get into the game in no time.
I have always hated the SD Gundam serises and the idea of chibi gundam, however this game made me change my ways...
If you are a gundam fan or a super robot teisen fan.. Just buy this now!!!

You have a vast choice of units and characters to recruit and buy..you also can make more teams and groups to despatch in missions which can bring you more units and items..leveling the characters up and watching them getting stronger is also fun..the developing system of the units is one of the coolest things in the game..so even if you have a bad unit with 7000HP you can level this unit up and then develop it into a stronger unit. 

´´this game is complete in many ways however the character creation is poor..if they have made it more complex it would awesome.. also the lack of other serises like Gundam UC and Thunder bolt made me sad :( because i wished to see the Unicorn gundam in action.. nevertheless they made this up by making the IBO Part so awesome and well done.",1634146337,1634146337,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But the game had so much more that I did not expect, first of all the campaigns are like short versions of the anime they portray, although not doing the anime justice of course they are really condensed here and there will be lots and lots of dialogues before battles, but they are still a good way to draw you to the anime.
THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF GUNDAM TO ACQUIRE, you can develop Mobile Suits to improved versions of different ones depending on relation and level, finding every each one for me was just really fun, it got me excited to see the next one, and there are a lot of animations for the gundam attacks, for the ones that I saw the series I can say that they are pixel perfect on portraing the iconic attacks.
Lots of stages have challenges, and those who don't have optional quests that will grant you new characters, new MS, new mods, warships, etc.
Since this game has some RPG mechanics, your favourite Gundam might not be the strongest, eve on highest level, and on the highest diffilcuty I recommend the strongest of MS and characters, that sucks a little bit IMO.

It's kind of a gem, actually. The graphics look good, nice and crisp, the music is great, and I think they put  a lot of time into the battle videos and explosions. 

However, at first this game felt like a really poor tactical game with missions that took 30-60 minutes each and I was upset and gave it a thumbs down. Yes, the actual ""strategy"" part of the game is somewhat simple, it's mostly flat terrain. But, someone made the analogy that this game is a lot like Disgaea and Dynasty Warriors combined. It's tactical like Disgaea with nice anime artwork and interface, but it's like Dynasty Warriors that you play and replay missions over and over to unlock more characters and mechs. Meeting certain conditions to unlock new pilots and mechs, abiltiies, and leveling up and a bit more beyond that. You will be overwhelmed because there is just SO MUCH to do. I would suggest reading some of the guides on the Steam Community for this game, they are excellent and will help you out immensely. There doesn't seem to be a manual, just a very poor tutorial that doesn't even scratch the surface of everything.

WORD OF WARNING - Do not buy any DLC until you have played the game a LOT, the DLCs give you game breaking items that will simply remove any and all challenge from the game.

You have an incredible selection of mobile suits you can produce and gear up your squad with. You can create your own custom pilots or recruits the ones from the series, and you can even go as far as enhancing and customizing your battleships and suits.

It can feel a little daunting at first, however, as there's a ton of different stats and actions to keep track of. However, the story mode eases you into the flow of battle and features nicely, and you can repeat easier chapters as often as you want until you feel at home.

It also gives you the chance to run training routines (which can take a while unless you use boosters to shorten the training time) while you're not playing. That way you can make some credits and level up suits and pilots even when you're not playing. Just be warned that you won't be able to use any units deployes for training.

But i think they only focusing on increasing the graphic quality and animation. But i am annoyed how there are so many units that has less weapons than they supposed to be? Like why do i need to use trans- am for the GNXIV to use it's buster sword? There are others but i am to tired to check it 1 by 1. Also don't buy the dlc? i guess it's only dispatch missions not real extra mission. some are but not most of them. I am crashing pretty often in the game despite being higher than the recommended hardware. Also they remove multitarget attacking from individual units which makes you spend soo much time even for finishing one mission. I mean yea you could finish it in few turns if you have many units. But you will spend time moving all those units to kill the enemies. There are raid link ups and warship link ups which is the new multi target attacking. Warship link up existed in SDG G Genesis but raid link up are new feature where you can make group without battleships, interesting as some battles actually don't involve major capital ships even in the gundam story. Maybe since this is IBO SEED 00 Wing stories, i feel like non gundam unit is less loved but oh well i guess it's because i am too much in love with Mass produced/ special produced units from UC series like rezel, geara zulus, Messer. But my vita is dead so i can no longer play genesis and this is what i could play oh well.

And speaking of the DLC, I really like the fact that they decide to add more mobile suits and characters to the game that weren't from any of the four selected timelines, however, after you buy the DLC, you have to unlock all of the characters, Mobile Suits, BGMs, and abilities through dispatch missions, and even after you unlock the characters from the dispatch missions, you have to scout them out first by using the in game currency (Credits) in order to actually add them to your teams. This doesn't apply to anything else you unlock in the dispatch missions, thankfully. Though, the DLC is still great even after all of that.
Now, I still have some issues with some of the levels in this game.

There are a few missions in this game that I do not like at all. Especially the missions where you have to guard an allied unit or have to keep any enemy unit out of a specified area.
Lets start with the missions where you have to guard an allied unit. most of the missions where this happens are actually pretty ok, however, there are some missions where you have to guard a WEAK allied unit (or multiple), and the missions just throw thousands of enemies at them in order to destroy them, which makes those missions really hard. And it's not like those missions become easier after you level up your units a bit, because most of these kinds of missions are during parts of the levels where you cant even use your own units, and instead have to use units that you cant level up. Fortunately, there are only like 2 missions like this in the game, but i still hate these missions with a burning passion.

Next, let's talk about the missions where you have to keep enemy units out of a specified area. I don't dislike these kinds of missions as much as the other kinds of missions that I talked about, but I still don't like them anyway. Now, I know that there is a mission like this in the Mobile Suit Gundam Wing Story, and it wasn't too bad, but I can't remember if there are missions like this in other missions of the game. I also know that there is a mission like this in the first level of the expansion pass, though, and that level sucks. I don't know if it's actually hard, or if I just suck at the game (even though I beat it already), but the amount of enemies that that mission throws at you just makes it so difficult. However, I don't know if the expansion stage missions are supposed to be challenging, but I still do not like that mission at all (though, again, I probably just suck at the game).

Now, even after all of the negative things I said about this game, I would still recommend this game to any Mobile Suit Gundam, Super Robot Wars, or Tactical Game fan who are interested in this game. Just to name off a few positive things about this game:

Like I said at the beginning, this game has SO MANY mobile suits and Mobile Armors to choose from, and you can even have anyone character pilot any Mobile Suit or Mobile Armor, even if the MS/MA that the pilot is piloting doesn't originally belong to them, which can make for some awesome match-ups.

This game has voice acting (though, it's only in some parts).

This game has extra difficulties that you can choose, which offers in a challenge for any willing player, or anyone who already beat the game but wants to do another playthrough on a higher difficulty.

You can make your own characters! You can choose what voice they can have, what abilities they can have, and even the BGM that plays during their battle cutscenes.

And speaking of the BGMs, this game has a ton of remixed BGMs from the alternate universe Gundam series, and you can even add in your own BGMs from music files on your computer.

The good. Great animations, music, visuals, and clearly a lot of great fanservice to dedicated fans (I'm a super super casual fan that's only experienced a few Gundam related things). There's also A LOT of customization with various suits, ships, pilots, etc and I love that in any game.

However there are some negatives. The battle animations are SLOW. I don't mean slow as in the suits moving themselves. I mean the battle sequences. They take forever to sit thru. Usually what I do is wait until my unit has completed their attack, and then I skip, as enemies take FOREVER to explode when they're defeated in a battle animation. Seriously, this game makes Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance look fast animation wise.

There's not enough explanation for new players/casual fans like myself that aren't aware of EVERYTHING in every specific Gundam series. For instance, all I know is that there are lots of mobile suits and factions in the series. That is it. I don't know what suits are from what series, what pilots are from what series, or what songs are from what series. I haven't been told any of this by the game. At least include some exposition showing a map or something, with a narrator explaining what each faction/planet/colony/whatever is like, what they want, are they democratic or autocratic, things like that. I know what you're gonna say. ""This game is *only* for die hard fans"". Uh, it's a full price game published by Bandai Namco. This isn't just ""meant for fans"", and shouldn't be. But the devs and writers thought differently I guess. 

This game is still good, but the issues I mentioned above are not good. I still recommend it, but only to fans and/or people who LOVE turn based rpgs with lots of customization like myself. I also love the designs, weapons and animations of the suits, which is also why I keep an eye out on this series every now and then. Gameplay wise, aside from the slow battle animations needing to be skipped it's pretty good. The music is fantastic, as is with typical anime music. The visuals are stunning, with a nice blend of sprites and models(?). I think they're models, or at least 2d models that look 3d. Just be careful if you're not a huge fan, as you'll be confused like me. You are allowed to skip the story but I don't like playing games without context. It feels empty when it's just mindless fighting without a reason for it to be mindless.

But I had no idea there was such an amazing franchise that took multiple series and stuck them in one game.  The game features my favorite Gundam series (Gundam Wing) as well as series I've not seen before.  The game's story is pretty much just a retelling of each of the different series (GW, SEED, 00, IBO, and the other side stories from those series.) Be ready for a lot of text and not all of it is voiced so it can take some time to get to the actual gameplay.  

The gameplay is a standard Tactical RPG on a grid with you having to complete certain objectives or you'll fail . Not to mention the number of secrete objectives the game will ask you to complete (usually having to destroy a specific target with a specific unit or getting to a location in a number of set moves.) When those are completed once you enter into the second phase of the battle, special enemies will spawn in for you to contend with.

The number of units you have access to is staggering though you have to work to unlock the vast majority of them.  

My only gripe with the game is the number of crashes I've endured since buying the game.  (I'm not sure if its because of my PC or just an issue with the animations playing and then crashing.)  But I've been able to get right back into my last mission thanks to the game autosaving after every turn passes.

I'd like to see them make another G Generation game but incorporate all the different Universes within the Gundam franchise.

- Not enough character interaction (like there is little to no interaction during team up attacks or fighting against characters they already know. Makes the world feels dead. Would be nice if there was more interaction even between protagonists and villains acknowledging/mocking each other. 
- Death animation explosions take too long and its too flashy....imagine watching it over and over having white flashing into your eyes.
- There is a severe lack of custom character models to choose from, needs a lot more!
- (opinion) higher tier suits attack animations are boring (big beam/ barrage KABOOM the end kinda thing)
- Some stages are just really too long.",1624686303,1628552980,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's kinda why i stay away from story repeated games, like dbz kakarot great game, but for someone whos replayed and watched the series many many times.

***
TL/DR: No brainier if you like Gundam and or turn based character strategy games such as fire emblem. Lots of content, lots of great Gundam (outside of the Universal Century timeline).
***
Preamble rant at Bandai: Pro tip when selling a game, include actual footage of the core game-play of your game when selling your game! If you ask your customers to either go in blind or have to do their own research to find out what your game is, you have failed at selling your product.
***
Intro: Onto the game, this is great for anyone who has an interest in the non-mainline Gundam series. Were talking Wing, Iron Blooded Orphans, Seed and 00 as main headliners. 

This game see's you forming a team of your favourite or your own custom characters with free ability to assign to any Gundam of your choosing. You want to realise your Gundam Wing Fantasies? This has got you. On top of this there's not just Gundams, were talking mobile suits, armours, tanks, helicopters, warships and more. Fantastic concept, new to the PC market.
***
Story/Presentation: Play through the stories of these different arcs, don't expect cut-scenes or clips form the show, this is all told through visual novels before, during and after each mission. The art is very nice but would have been great to see clips from the show make it in.
***
Core Game-play: When onto the battlefield were talking grid based, turn based, character driven combat. So each character is a single unit and levels up both themselves and their assigned vehicle. This plays similar to Fire Emblem, but instead of weapon durability, units have mana or EN. 

When commencing attacks a small CG cutscene plays out. These look nice but can be repetitive over long battles. These can be skipped with a mouse clip or chosen to be ignored. Battles can take between 20 minutes to an hour easily. My advice would be leave settings as default for the first couple of missions then configure to a more speedy approach.

There's a semi perma-death mechanic, your character lives will all skills, levels and stats intact, but their vehicle is destroyed. You can always re-build that unit later but money can be tight, especially if you are saving for a nice shiny new warship to carry your team in.

Between missions you change up your teams, there is an almost Pokemon evolution mechanic that when you level up your vehicles, you can ""Develop"" them into something else. Simple example: Upgrade the 'Wing Gundam' at level 7 to 'Wing Gundam Zero', when developed resets to level 1 and can be develloped further into the 'Epyon' at level 5 or the Endless Waltz variant at level 6 .You can see the choices in advance and it's multiple choice, nice and easy.
***
Music: The music...oh god the music. Includes tracks from the shows. Want to rock out to the guitar riffs of Wing? This game nails it. Not only does the music change dependant on the scenario but even ties to the characters or can be set manually. Great hearing ""The wings of a boy that killed Adolescence"" whenever I bring Heero along for the kill.
***
Mod Support: Check out Nexus. There's some character mods, these are poorly explained on how to find them once installed but once you figure it out, you can easily import Char and Amuro into your game
***
Conclusion: This should be enough to make a decision. The price is steep full price but if you like the idea of Gundam x Fire Emblem with persistent team and mech levelling, this is a great choice. The game could do with a few quality of life improvements to make it run faster, but if you aren't time constraint (you can save and quit mid battle anyway), this is great all round.",1626504367,1626504367,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would also recommend for young age groups.

However if you are looking for a good in depth, meaningful turn based game this is not it.
It is one of the most awful games I have ever played and is solely held up by it's Gundam attack scenes which you will end up skipping after you have seen them 4 or 5 times.

The battle maps look so basic/ bad that I was actually stunned, it now made sense why they have no screen shots of it on the steam shop.

The challenge is minor, the AI is bad and readable, most of the enemies won't even move until you trawl across the map to engage them.

There is no real customisation to take my interest aside for the fact you can make your own characters (Very Basic) & edit mp3's into your characters attack scenes ...which you end up skipping.

It's just bad, its like a Gundam catalogue strapped to a visual novel with some tedious gameplay thrown in.

To top things off it randomly crashes to desktop which is probably why it has so many temporary save files.

All that aside I did enjoy re-capping some of the story lines which is what pulled me through the fact I paid for this, but that was it for me.

I now always check game review videos because of this game lol.

•	While the game has a steep price (I bought it at $60 plus DLC/Expansions price), it gave me just over 200 hours of first time run through game time. If you took out some generic AFKing, I would say there is easily 180 hours of gameplay/story.
•	Though my dislike list is a little bit longer than my like list, don’t let that give you the wrong impression.
•	I can’t wait till the next one comes out to see what stories and Gundams they will have. Maybe some original story content with mixed universes like Gundam Beyond? 

[b][i]Like[/i][/b]
•	Tons of content: stories, Gundams, warships, characters; it is all there.
•	There are some side series (Gundam 00F, IBO Gekko, etc) that were never released US-side so you get to experience those stories; with (Japanese) voice acting!
•	You can start any series, jump around in the between series and change difficulty at the stage itself. 
•	Pretty much any character, Gundam and warship can be used whenever and wherever you want meaning you can have a custom Gundam team of your choice. A lot of customization at the char, Gundams and warship level as well.
•	It may not sound like a big deal but the ability to manage and customize the background music through all aspects of the game (menus, stages, even down to characters) is awesome. 

[b][i]Dislike[/i][/b]
•	Each series is an abridgment, so some minor story details will be omitted or oversimplified to meet the design goals of each series. This also means to get all the “feels” you will still need to watch the anime or get the source material.
•	Sub-par to non-existent tutorials. If you are unfamiliar with tactical games like this you may feel overwhelmed at first. Various information about stats for units (chars, mechs, warships) aren’t explained in any meaningful way, etc, etc.
•	For key scenes from the various series, they could have provided better cut scenes. Or higher quality map animations/interactions during story scenes.
•	The final mission for any of the stages is almost always “destroy all units”. Kind of gets repetitive which is such a wasted potential. “Killing everything” as a success criteria removes the thinking aspect of a tactical game since brute force/heavy hitters is always the best option.
•	Mistranslated or confusing description boxes for menus, settings, skills, abilities, etc can make you wonder what is going on sometimes.
•	The three main difficulties (normal, hard, extra) pretty much don’t matter once a mech/char get above lvl 20 or so. You get Hell difficulty unlocked after you beat the game but is there a point?

[b][h1]DLCs (Some paid; some free - as patches)[/h1][/b]
[b][i]Like[/i][/b]
•	They added more mobile suits, characters and dispatches.

[b][i]Dislike[/i][/b]
•	The paid DLCs are kind of expensive for no added gameplay (dispatches is not gameplay in my opinion).
•	Steam players don’t get the opportunity to buy the high definition BGM DLC like the console players do.

[b][h1]Expansion (Paid)[/h1][/b]

•	Even more dispatches, units, chars and a couple of stages.
•	Adds the INFERNO difficulty tier with corresponding INFERNO only mods and abilities.

[b][i]Dislike[/i][/b]
•	INFERNO is like jumping across the Grand Canyon in difference of difficulty between Hell and INFERNO. Only really worthwhile if you like to min/max and grind. There is no story elements tied to it.",1622397744,1622398421,True,14,0,0.692888498306274414,0,True,False,False

This amazing game and the horrible New Gundam Breaker. This game has a large amount of units you can get, develop into, and get from quests.  So not only do you have the Gundams from the main side of the Protags you can get the Units and mobile suits from side characters and even the enemy forces. The combat system is very satisfying. You can make your own pilots and their stats and level up grown is all based on the birthday and blood type you give them. The amount of detail and strategy in this game is amazing. Even so that you can add modification pieces such as weapon containers and solar units to add more power to your unit or even other cool passive abilities. Pilots have a natural level limit of 99 and you can even limit break them to make them more powerful.  You can get units and pilots from all of the wing series, a good chunk of the seed series (meaning seed, destiny, astray, stargazer), Gundam 00, and IBO. And that's just from doing the story missions. The DLC content contains stuff such as G Gundam, Turn A, and so much more. Like I said if you love Gundam you might love this game. I know grid base battle strategy games are not everyone's cup of tea but if you don't mind learning how the game works I am sure you can learn to love this game. I mean heck I even 100% the achievement list and had a blast doing it for 198 hours and over 1100 turns. (yes the game keeps track of your play time and how many turns you had in your save information). Any way I 100% picking up this game and all the DLC packs.

This game is basically crack. 

The translations are wonky as hell, but they're almost like old school fan-subs that way which just adds to the charm for an aged otaku like me. When the horns start up in the BGM, it's like watching Robotech on a Saturday morning. The individual storylines are just as absurd as you would want from a narrative that centers around giant robots duking it out, and the way the art varies between the different series is just fun. Coupled with the cutesy-mecha style of the rendered 3D graphics and the entire look and feel of the game is pure entertainment.

From a tactical perspective, the gameplay can occasionally set some difficult targets, but the normal mode for each level should be manageable by about everyone. You can have a pretty big squad and the tactical design favors the player a lot (gives that nice OP giant robot feel), but you'll be battling swarms of enemy mecha, it balances out at the higher difficulty levels when the enemy units start actively working together. The way that individual mecha can synergize within their own squads is an absolute joy, though, and makes planning and executing complex strategies highly fulfilling.

The number of options becomes overwhelming pretty quickly. There is an absolutely ridiculous number of available mecha and variants, so many different personnel, and so many customization strategies. I know a lot of the things in here are fan service for an IP with which I'm largely unfamiliar. It doesn't matter; for someone that love to tweak efficiencies and develop strategic patterns it is absolutely immersive.

As a SRW veteran  im very impressed with the game for what it is. The entire develop mobile suit system is very interesting as it lets you go from using a combat helicopter or tank into having a mobile suit. The dispatch system is a nice way to make it so even if you arnt playing the game at the moment your still doing some sort of progress. The only thing i wish the game had was a better custom character creator cause just having 2 preset options for each series then just pick a different voice feels kind of bland and lack luster.

Pros:
- Collection your favorite machines and chars from gundam wing to Iron blooded orphans (includes minor series if you get the DLCS)
-Large roster of ships, Vehicles, suits, and characters.
- multiple ways to get your favorite machines.
- very good audio
- Straight forward controls
- dispatch system that progress's when your not playing the game
- special abilities and features from the series are included such as nano laminate armor(iron blood on ALL suits) that reduce the effectiveness of beam weapons, Seed's phase shift armor system reducing physical damage, and 00s GN fields.

Inbetween:
- ok animations for a game that's a gundam take on SRW 
- some stages have to be repeated MULTIPLE times to unlock the ship you want due to its shorter aperance (ok if you don't mind grinding)
- can can bit a little slow to get into to start or unlock certain desired pilots and mobile suits.
- Combat can be somewhat  challenging to start off as even cannon fodders suits (grazes, ginns, tierans) can rip apart a gundam meaning you cant send a single gundam into the heart of 30 enemies and expect it to win.

Cons:
- only goes from Gundam wing to iron blood. Meaning everything from before wing is not included. So no suits from Gundam, Zeta, ZZ, and unicorn for example.
-very high unreasonable cost for the game and the DLC for the age of the game. Wait till on sale to pick up the game and the DLC.
- very minimal custom Character creation system with only 8 (15 if you include the flight suit variations) options of premade model per gender. 
-slow earning of ingame credits (without using the the dispatch system) combined with high cost for things such as ships makes the game very slow to progress if your looking to get ships like the Archangel and Minerva. 
- very easy to cheese certain stages due to suit gimmicks. Such as bringing Iron blooded orphan suits into the late seed and seed destiny levels and beam weapons do almost no damage to the.


All and all if you have played the SRW series and/or  are a gundam fan i can recommend this game to you, the same goes if you like grid based RTS games. but only when its on sale as i do not feel it deserves the 3A price tag almost 2 and a half years after release.",1620834288,1620834370,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Given the way Sony is these days, I'm glad this game is now available on other platforms and properly translated to boot.

What more can I say? This game gets better with every iteration. My only complaint here is the character creation section, it SERIOUSLY lacks variety in terms of clothing options, color, hairstyles, facial template and many others. You'd think more effort could be put into them since it's merely in 2D.

But I digress, the robots take center stage here and I'm just thankful I can finally see proper cleavage on some of the more prominent female characters from the Gundam series, Sumeragi Lee Noriega never looked more desirable since the moment I first laid eyes on her in the anime.

While not a fan of SD gundam, I can appreciate the style and I can say that as a tactical 'RPG' along the lines of other games (such as Fire Emblem) it is pretty decent.  The art is crisp and clean, the audio is clear and many of the sounds come right from the shows. The game play is enjoyable with the developing gundams for new gundams after they level up a bit.  There is a huge list of gundams available, even some from mangas that never made it to being shows.  The animations are beautiful and are enjoyable to watch, and can be skipped for those who get tired of seeing them and want a battle to move faster.

That said, some of the movement sounds for a few of the gundams, such as the Iron Blooded Orphans series gundams, have a very loud and somewhat out of place movement sound from all the other gundams.  While it is neat going through the bullet points of the different shows, which I feel is perfectly fine for a game of this type, I think I would have enjoyed this with a 'mercenary mode' alongside the regular story mode.  Also, for something that is very close to a 'crossover' game, there is absolutely NO crossover.  Interactions between different pilots and recognizing different gundams would have been nice.  I get why they did not go in that direction as they wanted to showcase the stories of the different animated series, but having some recognition of interaction between the characters would be nice.  I also get that they really just took audio from the shows and re-used it instead of recording new audio, but I feel it is a huge missed opportunity to start a new series of games that could rival the Fire Emblem series.",1620054163,1620054163,True,1,0,0.515886604785919189,0,True,False,False

Now, for a little background, I am a strategy game fanatic. I love everything that the genre had to offer, one of my favorite games being the Advance Wars series. And this game scratched the itch I had for a long time:  A turn based Strategy game with Mobile Suits in it.

Oh how suprised I was when I bought this game. The game has multiple campaigns to choose from, even going so far to put some of the Manga stories in the game. The controls are fluid, and the amount of customazation options are fantastic. Before I knew it, I was making multiple characters with their own mobile suits.

One thing that I do want to mention is the lack of a tutorial. To be fair, the game isnt that hard, and allot of the things are explained through popup windows. But it takes awhile to get used to navigating the multiple menu's, and how to access certain things. But once you do, the game is allot of fun. After every campaign mission, I check to see if my characters can be upgraded, can get new skills and if the MS they have can be upgraded to new/better MS. You can have your character start in a leo, and have him end up in Epyon. 

The game plays as any other turn based strategy game. Though one can hit bonus objectives within the game to unlock more skills. But only if ya can beat the group of enemies that spawn in the mission once you HIT the bonus objective. It makes the game harder, but also more rewarding. 

Lastly, you can send your team out on missions. These missions are based in real time, but well worth the effort. Multiple times, I send my team on a training mission before closing the game, and when I started the game back up a day later, they got back from the mission, and got allot of XP and cash for it. Its also a great way too unlock MS, and honestly, you will need the cash to buy some of the ships or other characters.

All in all, this has become THE Gundam game for me. I love the graphics, the customization options and everything in between. If your a Gundam fan AND a fan of turn based strategy, you can buy this game without hesitation! If your not a big gundam fan, but yer intrueged buy what I decribed?

They are of, and only of, the battle animations which occur every time a unit attacks. Looking over them once more, I don't think there is a single frame that shows the SNES level, flat sprites, maps, or the dull click-through dialogue screens that make up the actual bulk of the game.

The animations are cool and all but after you see them once or twice you end up wanting to skip them too, after all, they just repeat over and over and take around 30 secs or more to complete a piece. Maybe if enemies were a one hit-kill it would be more interesting, but most enemies need multiple hits to finish which makes all the flash and glamour of an attack look silly when the enemy is still there even after so many explosions.

The core game play is EXTREMELY boring and this is coming from a fan of tactics games. Granted, I didn't even get through a 2nd level before uninstalling, but from what I saw, there is very little in the way of tactics. Just move toward a unit and FR UR LAZERS.

Let me make the bold statement first: I don't think you have to be a Mecha fan to get into this game or enjoy it. As long as you like TRPGs it is enough. 

Story:
Story wise this game covers Alternate Universe (AU) Gundam timelines like Gundam Wing, 00, and Seed with some added combat that didnt happen in the respective manga/anime. So far from what I have seen it's accurate to the animes so if you're not a mecha anime fan maybe this gives you a push to try the genre (Please do :) ). To be honest it's perfect as an intro or nudge into the genre because the AU Gundam stories are complete standalone stories to the Universal Century (UC) Timeline (The original gundam, Unicorn etc), perfect to get your feet wet (Again. please try the mecha genre, the Mecha Anime community is among the most welcoming and enthusiastic in the best way possible.)  


Mechanics:
The game takes a bit of getting used to with it's mechanics based on formations and so on, but given that you can repeat stages as much as you want you can take your time and get familiar with said mechanics instead of risking frustration by getting to a more difficult mission and getting crushed. 

Like many TRPGs this game does feature Perma-Death, if your suit is defeated, while the pilot lives, the suit is lost. This of course means a pilot can eventually get stronger and have their skills get the most out of a weaker suit. 

To relieve pressure from mission failure/suit loss you also have access to dispatch missions where you send out one of your teams out but cant use them for story chapters. Many of these include suits so you can replace lost suits that way if you need to. 

Surviiving and powering up a suit rewards you with being able to progress suits in a fashion similar to Pokemon, which is something I find interesting, and being able to take some suits to a path of natural evolution (Example: a Leo Ground Type [OZ] can be turned into a Tallgeese I because the Leo is essentially a toned down, simplified mass produced Tallgeese) is pretty cool.

You are given a set of characters already (Mark Guilder on the Phoenix Gundam is hard carrying early for me), but you can also create your own characters. I will have to knock the game a bit here though because there just aren't many character portraits to choose from and zero differences in shades of skin or hair color which would have been more than enough. to put it bluntly more effort clearly should have been made here when you offer the option of custom characters in this day and age. 

Adding on to characters you can also recruit story characters like Noin from Wing, or Crank Zent from Iron Blooded Orphans to satisfy Head Canons.

At it's worst this game is a good time killer. At it's best it is a competent TRPG.",1617424049,1617424049,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Do you spread thin and attack everything, or group up and leave an area exposed? Do you press a close-range advantage or return to your ship and swap for long-range equipment to prepare for the next wave? Add in other things like multiple battlefields (there are stages where the battle is both on land and in the air, and you must wisely move units around to win), warship raid groups, and other systems and the game is a lot of fun with hours of gameplay.

Outside of battle you can customize your battle groups, develop units, recruit characters, and basically build your dream team.

The missions are an abridged version of the events in the anime or manga source material. Everything is tied up with gorgeous animations and great remixes of music from the anime. 

Overall, if you're a Gundam fan and you have even a passing interest in Fire Emblem style games, pick this one up. I'd recommend waiting for a sale and grabbing the deluxe version.

You can play as grunt suits

The animations are pretty great.

The raid feature I like. 

Mechanics are really well integrated and for the most part very easy to under stand.

Able to make Custom characters im a sucker for the most basic kinds of it.

Dislikes:
The amount of DLC units are huge and its just dispatch missions with no playable levels.

I kinda wish that we can customize the look of portraits, it doesnt have to be much maybe like a couple hairstyles and a hair color choice maybe skin color too. 

I kind of wish there was more original levels for my units, I know its a nitpick its not like it makes the game bad. Just a personal thought.

You've got literally all the good Gundam series as a part of the base game and the controls are actually responsive, not only are they responsive they also you know, work as intended, it's a uh strategy game percentages n crap and repeating animations oh god the animations.

Combat/Gameplay/Difficulty

Speaking in non-run on sentences the game is great you've got basic 1v1 combat that every strategy game uses and then you've got gank (2-5v1) combat which is how you'll get through some engagements and then finally you have Group attacks which will carry you since it does Special damage Gundams Wing, SEED, 00, and Iron-Blooded.

Biggest criticism for me here however is difficulty here is how it's lined up:
Normal is baby Journalist aspirant
Hard is Easy
Extra is Normal
Hell(?)(Whatever it was called) is Hard
       This absolutely pissed me off cause I went through the entire game on Normal expecting the AI to actually be dangerous since ya know you're outnumbered and the enemy might be able to gank attack but no just no, you gotta go onto Hard or more to actually be gank attacked and that's another thing Hell difficulty is the only base difficulty where you can actually get Group attacked.
        Now with that said this is the only time I've had units actually get blown up because the AI was smart, the only other times my units blew up was because I was either
         A) Messing around and playing like how they would in the Animes
                or
         B) Same thing as A except this time I went commando and sent my OP Avatar in a Ginn towards the enemy, center mass and he got ganked and group attacked. (Should also mention this is on Hell)
(Stats for him were 900 Command, 1517 Melee, 656 Ranged, 599 Defence, 690 Reaction, 499+30 Awaken with Super Pilot on 900 kill? Ginns were brand new)

Mechs

      Weapon Options
OK so we now know to play on Extra from start what else?

Well the mechs were pretty nice, now I say nice because I'm a UC fan okay so JUST SO YOU KNOW this is biased. I ran through the game with all the Gundam units atleast once, okay I lied a MAJORITY of the Gundams because I wanted to see that 100% and I'll say this.

More than likely the Gundam will suck ass especially if it's a prototype unit with the exception of Phoenix (we don't count M1s here).  Why do they suck ass? They literally play the same, or the prototype ones at least, let's look at some units.

Dual Gundam, what's he got? Sword, Rifle, Vulcans and Misc weapon.
What do the Astrays have? Sword, Rifle, Vulcans and Misc weapon (except blue he only has the 3).
How about Wing? Sword, Vulcans, Buster Rifle, Misc weapon, MAP weapon.
Okay Exia then. Sword, Rifle, and 2 different variants which then blur the line plus Trans-am.

Point is every unit feels the same basically it's just that SOME units are special and get special damage weapons like Gundam X and Turn A

Another thing. Most of the mechs use the same stock animation even Gundams sometimes and definitely the MP (Mass Produced) units, more than likely you'll be seeing the same thing with a new coat of paint on it (cough 00).

Characters

Yeah not much you've got 4 or 5 different variations of Kira 'Jesus f'n Chris' Yamato and enough Takehito Koyasus (DIO's VA) for a ship harem. Aside from that you can make avatars of your mates and see em become mass murderers and still act like nothing happened I know I did! They're also super annoying seeing as how you can have your mates go ""Waaaugh"" and by that I should say the enemies use the same voices as the custom characters so yeah SUPER cool, did I also mention how you're all marry suer than Kira 'Jesus f'n Chris' Yamato? Legit you start off with all stats breaking even at around 100-200.

Wrap up

I'm pretty sure I could say more but I've said enough. There's just not enough of Thanos' balance as how everything should've been ya know, frickin running around with a Strike Dagger inflicting +17000 damage from a simple sword on Nanolaminate armor.

DLC
FORGOT DLC

DON'T DO IT MAN IT AIN'T WORTH IT!! Kinda meh really left the same taste as vanilla in my mouth except it was just disgusting how the DLC was dispatch missions (That means you have to wait 2 hours + for a reward THEN AGAIN you can spend 6 speed ups and get 6 speed ups back on 1st try (Emphasis on 1ST TRY)). Haven't bought the actually mission pass and don't plan on it but I will say this. Blazing is pretty nice with Gundam X.

Right off the bat, if you aren't a fan of Gundam, or of the G Generation series, what are you doing here? Go look at Cyberpunk or something.

For fans of the series, where Genesis focused on all things UC, this game revolves around all things Wing, 00, Seed, and IBO.
Series focus aside, this is really mostly the same game as Genesis, just with different units and mission storylines. That said. the lineup of suits definitely feels more fleshed out, with fewer colour swapped variants than in genesis (150000 zaku variants anybody?).
The way stats, units. pilots, missions, and money making work are largely the same as in Genesis. The only real ""new"" mechanic is a timer based mission system where u send groups off for a few hours and, depending on their stats, they get some exp+cash and a completion rating based on whatever mission you sent them on. 
This part of the game feels kind of like some of the timers in mobile games, but once you have 3 or 4 warship/raid groups set up you'll always have at least 2 sitting around doing nothing, so this is... something to do with them I guess.
Game works and runs fine, so if more G Generation is what you're looking for, just go for it.

As far as the DLC goes, your mileage may vary. The packs are pricey for what they contain. They don't give any new playable missions, only the ""mobile"" missions you send groups away on for a few hours. They also only contain a few units per pack. If there is one unit you absolutely want in some of these, a sale is probably your best bet.

The expansion pack, well. Just go click into that and look at the reviews for it. They aren't positive for a reason.",1608473583,1608473642,True,0,0,0.448129057884216309,0,True,False,False

And yeah I know this it's just fanservice for the Gundam fanbase, but tbh that's the least important feature if you aske me. So, if you like SRPG try it, the story doesn't matter, skip it. If you like Gundam and you are curious and have the patiance to learn the mechanics it's a good entry for a SRPG also a good entry for the Gundam series. A win-win.

Now. There's only one game mode, the Story Mode, and that's not cool. Although the main campaings have a lot of maps, on a grinding it's always a nice touch have a little of variety. And that's the only thing I really didn't like about this game. The customization of units are the best part of the game you can create, upgrade, modify, combine your own Gundams, that's fucking gold dude! The pilots/staff mechanics it's also really good, everyone has stats for every situation, even the Gundams. And the best part is that you can improve the stats of your Gundams, pilots and staf with money! Because the level it's just a number, I wish every RPG were like that. So don't worry on leaving units for later, you always can rely on money to catch up with the rest or just get crazy and play with the stats to try new things. 
The combat it's very dynamic with a combo-support system and with this feature of: Kill enemy gain a extra turn for the unit. Not boring at all.

Have to say I'm not a big fan of Gundam and this is my first game of the series and I'm very impressed so, give it a try!

If you are interested in tactics then this game is for you. You don't have to be a Gundam fan to enjoy it, or if your looking to get into Gundam then this game will without doubt give you a taste of it. The game is very beautiful and each mobile suit has very smooth animations to compliment the gameplay. If you are a seed fan then you will be blessed with the amount of suits that's in the game. Form a ship crew or a raid unit before you sortie out, because get ready you about to be grinding alot since the game doesn't reward you as much after each story mission. It makes you level your units and develop them into a new suits to further progress into the game.

Overall a very good game with great soundtrack that constantly keeps you vibing. The custom character customisation is not the best however content in the game patches that mess up, so I guess its forgivable.

SD Gundam G Generation is a series of strategy-RPG games that focus on the Gundam. Developed by TOM CREATE and Released by Bandai. It's long time series since late 90s and still continue to this day. However SD Gundam G Generation Cross Rays is special than other because it's the first in this series that is officially localized outside of Japan and got released worldwide in major platform.

The game is actually very popular much like Super Robot Wars counterpart in Japan, as it's only game that allow wide customization and ability to use many Gundam in the way beyond imagine. Countless of animations and copious eye candy fanservices, each mobile suit can have unique animations for themselves for each moveset, animation for dodging, animation for making entrance and exit and much more. The story that catches on the glimpse of beauty presented in the series are what make the them great despite the subjective Super Deformed fashion and somewhat straightforward gameplay. 

Crossrays will include a major casts and mobile suit from 4 main timeline gundam series; 
[list]
[*]After Colony (A.C.) (Gundam Wing)
[*]Cosmic Era (C.E.) (Gundam SEED)
[*]Anno Domini (A.D.) (Gundam 00)
[*]Post Disaster (P.D.) (Iron Blooded Orphans) [/list]

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]

It's turn based strategy with RPG element. You level up your unit to gain more stats, and more stats mean more power. While all carefully position your units to counter enemy or stay outside of potential enemy range to stay alive within enemy's turn. Use money to buy more people and equipment to further strengthen your team. The Classic Gameplay like that is what it really is in this game. 

Crossrays present two main entities which are the center of your power; Pilot and Mobile Suit(MS). Pilot is a character which can pilot the MS and goes into battle, they have their own status which affect several game mechanic like Damage, Accuracy and Evasion and so much more. Mobile Suit function much like weapon or equipment that can be leveled, and  can be developed or upgraded to an even stronger weapon when the level has reached certain value. Much like Pilot, Mobile Suit also has status that also affect the overall gameplay. You have the both pilot and MS then you level up them until you can complete everything in the game, this is the generally objective of the game.

What make G Generation so great is the diverse amount of characters and MSs you can select from. Each MS comes with own weapon moveset and each of these moveset will have animations that're carefully crafted for maximum eye candy fanservice. Half of the fun is actually watching your unit destroying enemy in the coolest fashion possible from these moveset while listening to your favorite character chant some catchy line from anime series.  All the while watching a recap of important storyline from the original show. Crossrays also adds some cutscenes to the stories and incorporated into the game.

This game has so much customization that can be done on your character, therefore the freedom of choice is immersive. Upgrading your character status, train them abilities, then give them the best mobile suit you can find, or match their own personal mobile suit from the show, this is your choice. In additional to character in the show, you can make your own custom character as well as an original characters that does not present in any anime series before to add up your team.

Over 100 Missions to play, and a Dispatch Mission system that allow your team to grind while not actually playing. Over 200 characters and 400 MS to choose from and diverse farmable abilities that can give everyone an edge needed to compete with each other. There's really no limited in what character and MS you can select, you basically can make everyone works. Which is also a charm of Crossrays because this is the first time in the installation that allow player to customize pilot and their abilities in almost everyway as opposed to older game. Crossrays is also the first installation that emphasis pilot's performance over MS, and allow even the weaker grunt unit to perform like a cutting edge unit as long as the pilot is the an ace themselves. 

[h3]Story and Music[/h3]

The series featured are 00, Seed, Wing and Iron-Blooded Orphans, and some of spin off. Stories in this game are picked directly from animation series of important scenes and major point of each plots. You're playing the part of completing the plotline and while watching the familiar scene unflow. As well as listening to the rearranged of familiar music or original soundtrack. Story is somewhat made for a fan of series because there're so much they can include in the game but is more than enough to understand overall story plotline on each series, and acts as perfect recap for a fan to recall a scenes. 

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

I personally enjoy this game. I have done a lot of things in these hundred of hours and it seems to never end. I have so much plan to do like level up another group of dream I come up with, farming abilities so I can train them. Completing every quests and such.

If you're the fan of Gundam, there's no reason to say no, it's probably one of the best Gundam Game you can find. If you're not then you may give it a try, remembering that the reward of this game is to build your ultimate team from diverse of choices, and get everything done in own customized style.",1600519849,1604473029,True,29,0,0.732929408550262451,1,True,False,False

-No strategy. You only play the battles to unlock and upgrade gundams and pilots. As long as you field the ones with the best stats you have, you can't lose. Its just a meaningless grind.

Sad to say this is not a good game, there isnt much strategy as the AI isnt smart, there isnt much fun cause the dialogue takes forever with a bad layout of controls, and the cutscenes get old rather quickly.

The series covered by this are Gundam Wing, SEED + SEED Destiny, 00 and Iron Blooded Orphans. I was surprised at how much it goes into the side stories like Astray and Stargazer and all those.

Gameplay is pretty standard SRPG, grid based movement and combat. I would've liked some more mechanics but that might be a personal thing. Stat distribution and make numbers go higher almost reach Disgaea levels here, along with a suit evolution system kind of like Digimon. Would've liked some more varied attacks too across units too, but I guess there's only so much you can do with a lot of suits having generic weapons. The graphics are much better than the other games of the series though. Downsides are that the game sometimes just straight up crashes for me during the pilot recruit screen. I'm sad they didn't get the licensed music from the series, would've added a lot but I guess there's licensing issues.


Something I really enjoy is that they added dispatch missions in real time that can help you level any underleveled units you might have.

I managed that in a little over a month while working full time and not doing a lot else. I suppose that is a hint about how much I love the game. I had never played a game in this series, but I have played one Super Robot Wars game long ago, and it is a very similar gameplay. Basically, you control various Mobile Suits (MS) and Mobile Armor (MA) units which each have a pilot controlling them. Each unit has various weapons and abilities with varying strengths and ranges, and each battle has their own objectives to complete (mostly ending in ""Kill all remaining enemies"").

The game mostly appeal to fans of the Gundam series, featuring stages and battles iconic to the shows (see the series' names in the store description). The gameplay is very nice, allowing the player to customize their team(s) and experimenting with a multitude of units and pilots. I also love the attack animations (they are long, and you must select if you want to see the animations for every attack made) and the planning involved.

I would rate this game 85/100, and the main bad thing for this game is the translation. While I don't mind the japanese-only voices, the texts are very badly translated. Some abilities, descriptions and equipment are so badly translated that you need to either look online for a better fan translation or make mistakes and discover how certain things work. The text boxes also were never designed with translation in mind, and some texts have words cut over two lines. The other big issue is that the game isn't the first in its series, and the developers probably expected more returning players than new players, but this is the first non-japanese game in the series, and newcomers will have a hard time understanding most mechanics due to a lack of a proper tutorial. When starting the game, the player arrives in the main menu without any explanation about what to do. The ""tutorial"" is hidden in the ""Gallery"" menu (probably a bad translation), and some features are explained when you encounter them, but the translation makes it hard to fully understand everything. In expected Japanese fashion, there is a lot of grinding to do if you want to try the hardest difficulties, but you don't need to grind if you just want to experience the stories.

All I can say is the difficulty curve playing story is indeed a little challenging as you continue inward even on normal if you keep switching and leveling new suits like I do. The perma lose of suits though upon destruction is harsh but understandable. I'm just glad I don't lose the pilot as well. The Development and Design aspect of the game is by far my favorite feature. You can take a suit that you own that is leveled up and just turn it into a new suit and acquire the blueprint for it so you can purchase another one and the suits often stay within that series minus a few special suits. Design I thought was more customization but instead it allows me to compare suits to come up with new blueprints for other suits. Sure it means I don't get the suit I have to go buy it but it at least giving me an option that way is nice too. Rewards for meeting certain conditions is nice too. I'd say the real issue is farming Capital so you can even purchase anything. The only thing I wish there was more of is options for visuals for Custom Characters.

[h1]First Impression[/h1]
[b]SD Gundam G Generation Crossrays[/b] is a tactical game in which players can acquire diverse pilots and mobile suits that together make up for a unit. There are some downsides and some upsides here, but what impressed me was the care and huge amount of animation units have. They make it, so it is never boring to watch the fights and is an accomplishment to see a game put so much care into them. While having some issues regarding timing, this title does a solid job overall.

[h1] Battle Animations, The Butter and Bread of the Stars[/h1]
I enjoyed how crisp and fluid battles animations are in this game, they make the [b]Gundam[/b] designs come alive on the screen, and each of the units has their animations! The number of animations in this title must be absurd, as [b]mobile suits[/b] can have between 3-6 animations of their own. The stellar units, aka main protagonists' mechs, have more flair to show, as they even get personalized dodging animations and effects that will blow your mind! It makes for a pretty show that you never get tired of watching, and you look forward to the ones of your newly acquired troops!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2181481634

I disliked that scout characters seem to have an advantage over customizable characters, which sort of downplays the reason to make your characters. It is due to some of them having incredible stats with the addition of unique skills reserve to them. It can range from high morale at the begging of battle to getting extra stats in certain types of machines or just multiple effects. Customizable characters do hold their ground at times, but they will not be as good as the best of scout characters, which are easy to acquire overall and beasts on the battlefield.

The voices are in Japanese, and characters retain their original VA's. Also, there is a vast selection of music to choose from to add to any character so that you can listen to your favorite songs during maps ranging around 120 tracks. Between the different animations, characters, and soundtracks, there is a lot of content to use and choose in your playthrough! That gives a lot of freedom in how to define the core experience to the player.

[h1]Space can be silent, Gravity can be quite slow[/h1]
[b]Crossrays[/b] also adds some cutscenes to some of the stories incorporated into the game, which is a nice touch. The series featured are 00, Seed, Wing and Iron-Blooded Orphans. These are among the most popular in the franchise, so it makes sense they would choose them, but the lack of UC storylines and others such as Build Fighter left me wishing for more diversity. I do appreciate the other stories such as [b]Astray or G-unit[/b] as they were delightful to discover and see fleshed out on screen! I think [b]G-unit[/b] can give a feel of UC at times, so it does make up for it.

The gameplay does have a core flaw, that anything you do in this game is prolonged to do. You choose a unit, and that opens a menu, then you move that unit, and that opens another menu, then it does battle, and it opens another menu. There are just too many sub-menus that slow down the pacing of the game while making it more cumbersome and less enjoyable. I think a more straightforward layout would have allowed me to navigate the menus quickly, sometimes less is more in the overall sense. It does not help that maps can be dragged between the 1 to 2-hour marks in some scenarios.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2181483240

The design of maps and missions does help a lot to make this bearable, as well as the different stats units, can have, and several types of attacks. Tasks can range from escort missions to survival or winning in less than X amount of turns; units meanwhile can have varieties of attacks such as [b]beam weapons or piercing ones[/b]. It is essential to bring balanced teams to cause some enemies can have a massive resistance to a kind of weapon. It was most notable in SEED and Iron-Blooded Orphans' scenarios.

[h1] Strong and Weak Points[/h1]
The strong points of this title are the incredible amount of animations, the dispatch missions, and the possibility of making your dream team. You can choose and recruit your favorite characters (unless that character is UC timeline, sorry) and make a powerful team that is a joy to use and see come together on the battlefield dominating foes. It can be hard at the start, but once you get some excellent scout characters and units, you be having an easy time even if a bit slow. Dispatch missions also add to the content, as they allow you to level up units while you are not playing by sending them to tasks that take hours to complete, from three to up fifteen. It is important who you bring into battle, and experienced pilots in their series will always do better.

The weak points here are the design-develop methods, the lack of UC, and that it can be quite overwhelming to play this game. Design-develop offers you the core way to get new units but requires you to sacrifice old units, meaning that it is constant pacing of swapping units until you feel quite happy with your set. It makes it hard to acquire new units at times unless you grind maps with guest units and fill their acquisition bar. The lack of UC is a bummer, as they were in the previous game, and I hope they return in the next one, and some maps can have up to 87 enemy units if not 120, so it can be quite heavy to take them up in one go.

[h1]X Notes[/h1]
It can run in most systems and tested on an RTX 2070 S. The game on launch has A and B buttons inverse, which you can fix in the menu's options. There is no native support for 2K full screen, so if you are above 1080p, you will have to do a borderless window. The Raid system is too powerful, so it is advisable to use two groups of it instead of a ship as they make long levels easier to digest. If you get tired or struggle, do short scenarios as they tend to be easier and last usually 30-40 minutes. [b]Destiny and 00 Scenarios[/b] can be gruesome. [b]Seed, Endless Waltz, Iron-Blooded Orphans, and G-unit[/b] is easier and simpler.

[h1] Finally…[/h1]
[b]SD Gundam G Generation Crossrays[/b] is a wonderful game for a [b]Gundam[/b] fan despite its flaws, and I had a great time with it. It does get hold by some pacing and layout issues that can be quite bothersome, but the core experience is delightful and true to the series. If you are not a fan of the franchise, I still recommend it to you as long as you do not mind slow pacing. The stories are explained properly, and despite some minor translation issues, it does the job just fine. My favorite scenario was [b]G-unit,[/b] what a rollercoaster of emotions and good writing!

The gameplay loop is wonderful, and it's super-fun evolving your existing Mobile Suits into new and wild designs.

The strategy and optimisation of characters and Suits is really in-depth.

So why do I have reservations? It's the level-design... quite simply.  When the mission splits into two maps, but there's no way to transfer units from one map to the other, and often one map has to wait patiently for the other to finish up... it's been mentioned elsewhere, by other reviewers more qualified than I.

There is also often ZERO player agency, so one map could be completely populated with a single NPC, fighting with a single overwhelming enemy force; and coincidentally, the higher difficulty settings, mean stronger NPCs which makes it far easier to complete the missions... there's still no way for the player to improve the situation by, you know, playing the game strategically.

Ahh well, I'm still playing at an early stage at 70 hours, so there's plenty of bang for your buck... if I can overlook the often clunky level-design... I'd say it was completely, overwhelmingly enjoyable.",1595762722,1595762722,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While some of the translation is a bit spotty, for the most part the stories are conveyed accurately,  so it makes a great refresher on the timelines included. Still, if you don't know at least a couple of them, a lot of the charm could be lost on you.

Having said that, let me say one thing right now. This is not a tactically challenging game. If you throw enough numbers at virtually any problem, it will go away, so the game won't be providing the top end tactical gamers with the fix they crave. What it does do incredibly well is let you do pretty much anything you want, and let your inner robot nerd out to play. Do you want to stick Lacus Clyne in a GINN and turn her into a killing machine the likes of which the C.E. has never seen? Give it enough time and capital, and you can totally do that.

You can field a team of virtually anyone who's touched a control panel from any of the included series, in any suit you'd like them to have, and they can be viable. You can even create a custom pilot of any of the factions instead, if you'd like.

In short, that's what this game is about. It's not the deep stratigy of a hardmode Super Robot Wars run where you score all the SR points. It's a big old toybox where you can bash any suit you want against a bunch  of enemies and enjoy the shiny battle animations, and it does a really great job of doing that.

If you're a gundam fan, or at least enjoyed one of these four series, and are okay with that, give this game a go.",1595698247,1595698247,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like its predecessor you get a mobile suit level it up and then you can upgrade it like wing zero to wing zero EU version.  Though it still has its problems. Stuff like capturing units in this game was bit different in genesis you can capture the the unknown units (Mobile suit) in this one only the warship units and it was hard to know how some of the game mechanics work. The biggest problem for me was the DLC instead of story missions you get Dispatch missions where you send a group of MS/warship for a certain amount of time  in real time to get the DLC I would've preferred we got stories instead.  The positive is more in game cut scenes in genesis the pilot will show himself in animated form in a MS that belonged to him in the anime in Cross rays you can do that with any MS.

-Cool battle animations, some over a minute long, and they can all be skipped and desired
-Sufficiently engaging turn-based combat
-Use any pilot in any mech with any theme (certain pilots will even get unique lines in mechs that aren't even from their series, case in point the Burning/God Gundam)
-Any unit/pilot can be viable late game with how easy it is to increase stats
-Good music, as well as the ability to add your own
-Covers the full timeline of four of the major Gundam series/timelines: Wing, SEED, 00, and Iron-Blooded Orphans.

Cons:
-Missions are very very long, usually at least an hour for each with the sheer number of units at a time
-The gameplay can get repetitive since there isn't much of a skill factor
-The game requires a lot of grind, and there's very few missions that allow you to grind enemies without gimmicks getting in the way
-Some mechs definitely got a lot more love than others in terms of animations, it'd be nice if each mech had a decent animation outside of the basic foot soldier units

In-depth review after several more hours

Pros:
-Looks fantastic
-Easy to run
-Smooth port overall
-kudos to bamco addressing the bugs on day 1 under 12 hours
-group dispatch helps you with a handful of stuff, more good than bad

Cons:
-seems like small amount of missions, could possibly be that im comparing to old ggen where there is more depth/stuff to kill per mission
-sometimes it feels like the animations are lazy as units could do more (see XN raiser, blue frame second revise, red frame kai)
-SEA translators/poor subbing quality. can also be seen in older games like the recent SRW
-difficulty is an odd thing to define, the ""easiness"" is fine but the extra hard doesnt feel extra, only hard...ish

Others:
-feels short, but im still putting in hours
-slapped in PS4 controller and its fantastic, all PS inputs displayed and functional as if i was playing on the PS4 (this comment is in response to the partial controller support tag)

do i find it worth my $60? yes, but maybe not for you if you havent played this series before or not into gundam as much
should i wait a bit before buying? also yes if you really think about buying it later

i only bought base game and will decide if season pass is worth it later down the road

Let me address the reason for that. There is one fun thing about Gundam Cross Rays that will keep me logging hours...it's a great idle game. You can get a small amount of experience through the process called dispatch, which lets your teams get a small (to medium once you have the stats to handle harder dispatches) amount of experience and money for you to use. This allows resources to be spent on the really fun part of the game - unlocking new Gundam's through the development, design or trading process. 

Unfortunately, actually using them in combat is a chore, because the level design is  just bad. It consists of throwing 100 brain-dead mooks at you (sometimes literally) and then hitting a ""historic moment"" and having 100 more show up, sometimes at the far end of the map. It's not all bad, I do like the raid linkup mechanic, which lets Gundams in the same unit cooperate to do a ton of damage, sometimes to numerous opponents, and I like the ""support"" system which allows you to use multiple Gundams against an opponent in both of their range and ""cover defense"" where nearby Gundams can tank for each other, but the AI is so bad, (on purpose because of the quantity of opponents, I think) that some units will literally idle until you walk into their firing range or just destroy them, and you have to watch them all skip their turn until you do so. Battles are actually tightest at their least epic. 

I do like the development aspect enough that I'm going to continue idling it until I get all the Gundams I want unlocked, after all, I already payed the price of entry and game releases are a little thin during the height of Covid, but if you asked me if I would have spent $60 (or even $20) for a Gundam idle game, I would have said no.",1595000188,1595019051,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a fan of Gundam, I love this. They have the OG Japanese voice actors, with english subs, so it's great! I only wish the english voice actor for Domon Kasshu was available to yell BURNING FINGER but can't win em all. You will love this game if you are a fan of the series.

As a Strategy RPG fan, it is highly reminiscent of the gameplay from Final Fantasy Tactics, which is great! But as it was originally a PSVita game, you can tell how limited the actual gameplay is. The units move around the map without any specific animation, but every time there's an action you can queue a cutscene of them performing their signature attacks. While this is awesome, it can break you away from immersion.

However, as a fan of both the series and the genre, I can say this game is highly addictive and fun. You constantly work towards upgrading your mobile suits and there is a ton of customization so there's a lot to keep you hooked.

I like the Super Robot Wars better but still a fine game on its own while a bit grindy. But at times like these where you are forced to work from home, it's a good kind of grind. Especially like that you can level up your units and characters by deploying them on missions when not playing. 

While the game play is challenging at first mostly because the units and characters you start with are not very good, there are methods that allow you to be OP rather quickly with all the money you can burn and with best units and pilots.

There is one serious issue and it is that each mission comes with way too much dialogues that takes way too long to get through. Perhaps they feel a lot less interesting because I already know the story. Super Robot Wars has a lot of dialogue, too, but they were more interesting and a lot less of a drag. Maybe increase number of missions and cram more game play inbetween dialogues? Missions in first playthrough are just way too long because of the dialogues.

But while it does share some similarities, such as the gorges attack cut scenes and the copious fan service, this series has more in common with Disgaea.  The game is VERY grind intensive, you'll be constantly striving to evolve your mechas into bigger, leaner, more powerful versions.  You'll start with the Strike, the Raiser, or the Wing Gundams, but soon be growing and evolving them into alt versions like the 00 Seven Sword Gundam or Wing Zero Custom.  There's also more than 400 mecha to collect and discover in the game so the grind goes deep and endless.  

You'll also be grinding for skills and money to evolve your pilots stats and make them more effective in piloting your mecha.  You can use money to upgrade stats at any time, you can also grind levels for skills that certain enemies drop.  

The name of the game here is ""The Grind.""  While SRW emphasizes speedy and fun battles, the SD G Genesis series emphasize nigh endless grinding.  The battles move at a far slower clip, in SRW the battles tend to end at a twenty minute mark, in this series its not uncommon for them to stretch on for an hour or even two.  

As seen by my hours on file, I enjoy this game tremendously and I appreciate the nigh-endless unlockables and options you have to create your perfect army of Gundams.  But for those looking for something speedier and more streamlined may want to watch some gameplay videos before investing.

I've been mostly a Super Robot Wars guy, and this game has been my first entry in the SD Gundam G Generation franchise. The overall gameplay and -flow is similar enough that I felt right at home, with the way your units are organized into squads and groups and how every weapon costs at least some amount of energy being the biggest differences.

This game covers the Gundam shows Wing, Seed, 00 and Iron-Blooded Orphans, complete with their manga / OVA spinoffs. The stages are abridged version of the respective storylines (and doing a rather good job at that, even having fairly lengthy Visual-Novel-style cutscenes so even complete newbies shouldn't feel completely lost as to what's going on).
You do get to control the protagonists of each respective story (called ""Guest"" units), but the main bulk of the fighting will be done by up to 2 of your own groups of units, which can encompass pilots and units from any show (including original units and pilots of the G Generation franchise, and even pilots you've created yourself).

Combat is pretty fun and straightforward, with a little bit of complexity regarding the squad system, though it boils down to units being encouraged to stick close to their squadmates to provide offensive and defensive support. There are even different ways of organizing your units (Warship Groups that are centered around a single warship, and Raid Groups that are more self-sufficient).

There's a fair bit of customization, as any character can pilot any unit (and some even have remarks when piloting units from another show that are similar enough to what they're used to), and even low-tier units can catch up to the big guys (so if you have a unit that you really like, don't be bothered if its initial stats might be lower).

The sheer amount of content is staggering, with quite a lot of missions and literally hundreds of units and pilots to unlock.

Interestingly enough, the game doesn't quite feel like having a lot of grinding. It's probably the worst at the start when you only have a single warship, but once you've got your hands on a second one it's pretty smooth.
This is mostly because of the Group Dispatches, which essentially let you send out groups to do farming and grinding on their own. They'll even do this while you aren't even playing the game, which is [i]very[/i] useful in keeping your ever-growing roster of units and pilots on equal footing.

If the core game isn't enough for you, there is the DLC which lets you unlock pilots and units from [i]even more[/i] shows. The ones from G Fighter are my personal favorites for being the most Super-Robot-y thing in this game.",1592734459,1592734459,True,43,0,0.820974469184875488,0,True,False,False

Normally, I'm one to pick up a game, play, get tired of it, and never come back to it. I just came back to it and have been working through the stages. I'm slow when it comes to doing things because I like to grind. That being said, I'm in over 100 hrs and still haven't gone through all of the levels.

Few things I will say...

I like that it's a multi Gundam universe not centered over the original. I do like the original, but when it comes to games, it's been done so many times I feel. To me it didn't feel like they centered on one series more than the others.

I also like the options it gives you. If you never liked a certain pilot in a series but loved their Gundam (or the other way around), you don't have to pair them together. You'll more than likely get one before the other anyway, and it allows you to mix and match to your playing style or even just your preference. You can also customize each character and suit to how you want. I've had a few times I wanted to change my main party members because I thought there was more potential for a different set, and while it took a few rounds, I found out I liked the new set up better. I have not tried the customizable characters yet, as when I tried, I didn't like the options they had, but this was a couple months back, and I believe they have added new features. I also like the option of customizing your menu screen's music.

Now, one thing I did not particularly like is the lack of general instructions. For the most part, I look over instructions in games very quickly to make sure there's no hidden surprises that might make or break the game I am playing. If you allow a suit to be destroyed in battle, it is gone. It does not come back after the level is done. Thankfully for me, I read comments and saw that in someone's review. If I had not, I would have been severely upset when I lost a unit.

Also, I feel like the balance is a little off. At the point I'm at right now, I almost feel like even extra is too easy. For so long, I saved up to get better stuff and didn't buy any new suits unless I had to, and it got really hard. Once I got the warship I was saving for and started spending and found the dispatch missions, it got really easy. That being said, I don't feel like I'm ready for inferno. That could just be me, though.

Overall, I give it top ratings, and I hope to see them continue to add things on.",1591567612,1591567612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[Update 20 Apr 2020]
Game crashes sometimes when I load a quick save. I don't load often, and the crash usually happens when I'm loading a quick save which is in the middle of a large scale battle (>30 units). Also occurs sometimes when I am just issuing commands on the overview, or when it's the beginning of a faction's turn. Have yet to encounter crashes outside of stages. However, with the autosave, there's little concern for these crashes. It doesn't take ages for the game to boot up, so it's not really an issue. But still, a crash is still a crash. Please fix soon!

The custom BGM option is perhaps the best feature in the entire game, especially if you have the Gundam albums lying around. You'll need to format them to a certain format, though, and you may want to consider normalising the loudness of the tracks to ITU BS.1770-3 standard at -23 LUFS, ±0.5LU, -1 dBTP (the PS4 standard, seeing that this is originally a PS4 game and their audio is likely to be mastered once for that platform and then ported to PC). If you don't normalise the loudness, you may have custom tracks that are either too loud or too soft compared to the in-game BGM.

In summary, to get the best out of the custom BGM option, (1) re-format the tracks to conform to the game's requirements so that they will show up in the options, and (2) normalise the loudness so that you get a consistent listening experience when the game changes between in-game and custom BGMs.",1575189542,1587371786,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If its not about gundam, this might be a common strategy rpg. The previous game SD Gundam Generation Genesis is my first contact with this game. Cross Rays has some improvements than it’s prequel, especially in graphic fidelity. First thing first, since I like gundam and gunpla, this review might be biased.

What’s this game is about? This game contains several series from the anime, not all tho. Included in this game is Gundam 00, Astray, Seed, Seed Destiny, Wings, Iron Blooded Orphans, Build Fighter, Stargazer, etc. Mostly are after the Universal Century (correct me if I’m wrong, not that familiar with gundam series since there are lots of them). Each series consists between 2 to 14 episodes that tells you some bits of the story.

Story
Well, to be blunt, this game is not about the story, is about gundam collection. If you want an in depth story, better watch the anime.

Gameplay
1.	Units in this game can be categorized into 2, mobile unit/mobile armor (MS/MA) and warships. Both types can move and attack, but warship cant do melee attack, only ranged. MS/MA some can melee while others only can do range attack. The difference between MS/MA with Warship is, you can put 8 MS/MA or less depends on each MS/MA’s size into one warship and bring the to battle and resupply your unit’s EN and HP. If you don’t have a warship, then you can only create a raid party consist of 8 MS/MA, but you cant resupply your EN and HP. 
2.	MS/MA has size from S/M/L/XL, S/M occupies one slot in a warship, the larger the MS, the more slots it will take.
3.	Each MS has their own set of attacks with different attack power and consumes different amount of EN each time you use it. If you ran out of EN, then you cant attack, that’s why warship plays an important role in battle
4.	When all the units in a warship is out, you can do group attack multiple enemies with your warship and the 8 MS units (9 in total) 
5.	Every MS/MA and warship can be produced using money, only if you have the blueprint for said unit.
6.	Each MS/MA can be developed into another types of MS/MA when they reach certain level, this is the fun part. You can earlier level to find stronger unit and clear the game at ease. 
7.	Besides develop, you can combine 2 different Lv 2 units to creat a new units. Each time you develop or design a unit, it will be registered. After that you can produce said unit using money, this is how you get a unit blueprint. Captured unit is not registered tho.
8.	Warship can only obtained by fulfilling quests or clearing stages.
9.	Each stage has some quests to be done, clear those quest, you can get various rewards such as MS/MA, warship or equipments. You can get new equipments by clearing quest or stage.
10.	Another good thing to level up your unit is dispatch mission, this is one feature that didn’t exist in the previous game. Each times you dispatch (a) units, they are unavailable to use for some time until that mission is over. Dispatch missions duration is varied from 1 and half hour to 15 hours, you can get money, MS/MA, equipments, and dispatch ticket. Dispatch ticket is used to shorten the time of dispatch missions.

Sound/music
Cant say much about this, since I play this game while listening to podcast. Why you ask? You can spend 1-2 hours maybe more in a stage because of the huge amount of enemies present in a stage. Waiting them taking action one by one got me sleepy.

Overall:
If you like gundam and grind? Then this one is worth the price. If you’re not familiar with gundam but you like robots/mechs, you can get it too, the graphic is a joy to my eyes. The only complaint I have for this game is, Bandai didn’t include all the gundams in it. 
PS: If you buy this, get Barbatos from Iron Blooded Orphans first, its one of the strongest melee attacker in my opinion, plus it has 8 forms in total.

- Retelling important event in non-UC(Universal Century) series, giving a sense of nostalgia(for older series) to the fan
- Improved 3D model, personally I like the new one because in older title the proportion is kinda off.
- Large amount of playable MS/MA unit
- If you progress enough, you can level up a grunt unit so it can be on par with series protagonist unit
- Well adjusted difficulty
- Improved warship combat/interaction
- Realization of side story for each series, giving more knowledge and information because in some region getting those kind of material is hard to get
- Easy to learn Turn-Based RPG for new player.

[h1]CONS[/h1]
- No original story (like G Generation Wars, World, and Overworld). Since it's only retelling some parts in each series, new player might be confused or not satisfied with how the game tell the story, unless they watch the original/remastered anime show
- The attack animation is good, but it could be better/more balanced. I understand if main protagonist unit have more unique animation than grunt units, but why some unit like Destiny Gundam (which is one of the series protagonist) doesn't get the unique evade animation while Strike Freedom Gundam get it, is this some kind of discrimination?
- I really miss the enhance step system. In older game, your pilot can improve their next step from just 3 step per turn and adding it until reach 9 steps and then Infinity step(or use a pilot skill to enable the) per turn, which is kinda OP. I understand if they do this because of balancing issues, but I really miss them especially if you're in late game. It makes you feel powerful, which is the point. Hope they bring this back with the next update (increase max cap level to 999)
- While the game is easy to learn, the game doesn't really tell you the more in depth mechanic so you still need a bit more practice/time to learn how the mechanic works
- Additional DLC might not be worth it for some people since it doesn't give you additional stage/original story

Overall this is a very good turn-based gundam game. Gameplay wise, I'd really recommend it for people who enjoy game like Disgaea series.",1586591010,1586730702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're familiar with those, well, you'll find SDGGGCR fairly approachable, up to a point - but ultimately, it's a fair bit more complicated in a great many ways, and the tutorials are pretty limited, so expect a learning-curve as you figure out how everything works. Heck, there's a few things I STILL don't know what means, even 80 hours in!

Still, that's just another way of saying that the game's got a lot of tactical depth. The way you compose and position your squads can all have significant impact, make no mistake! It just takes some experience to recognize exactly WHAT kind of impact.

Anyway, that aside - there are hundreds of awesome robots, and cool pilots to stick in them, and badass battleships to deploy them in, and goons with terrible aim to throw them at. Just as it should be! And there's certainly a lot of GAME there, with over a dozen storylines to play though, and individual battles easily lasting two or three hours.

BUT! Here's a secret for you, just for reading this far instead of skipping ahead to the TL;DR - my recommendation of this game is contingent on playing it on a PC, and using a cheat-program. I recommend Cheat Engine - it's free, easy to find, and easy to use. Why? Because the grinding in this game is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. Everything costs money, and TONS of it. Unlocked a new suit? It'll cost you a ton of money to actually BUILD it. Found a new pilot? It'll cost you a ton of money to recruit him. Unlocked a new suit-upgrade? It'll cost you HALF a ton of money to buy one. Obtained a new Ability during a mission? It'll cost you a quarter-ton of money to actually teach it to one of your pilots. Unlocked a new BATTLESHIP?! That'll be ONE MEGATON of money, please! Oh, you want the crew to go with it? Then it's one and a HALF megatons of money. And what did you get from that two-hour mission you just finished? Eh, about five grams worth of money. It's just... broken. Sure, there are ways to efficiently grind money, tricks to use, ways to do it partially while idling, but it just makes the whole game measurably less fun. If you want to idle for money, you play AdVenture Capitalist or something. You're here to play around with awesome mobile suits and cool pilots! So just use a cheat-program. Give yourself 10 million or so. Buy stuff whenever it gets unlocked, and just try to restrain yourself from using the training-feature (which is actually REMARKABLY cheap) to turn your pilots into overpowered monsters. Well, maybe use it to beef up your OC, not that the character creation feature is anything other than a laughing-stock.

Other than that? Only thing I can really think of to criticize is some of the skyboxes. The machines are all beautifully drawn and animated (in super-deformed shapes, of course, but that was standard in SRW too, and you soon stop noticing anyway), and some of the space-based battlegrounds look good too, but once you're planetside, you may suddenly find yourself moved to a Showa-era Godzilla-movie, fighting inside a large cardboard box with papier-mache mountains and a painted-on sea. Seriously, the sea is just... DISTRACTINGLY terrible, with certain attacks making it painfully clear that you're dealing with a completely flat and static picture pasted to the bottom of the skybox.

So yeah, other than those nitpicks and easily-corrected balancing-issues, it's really good! I've had a blast with it, certainly, and it's even introduced me to some offshot-series that look pretty cool, which I'm now planning to watch.

If you want to know how the game plays, search any video for SRW gameplay.

It's a turn-based tactic RPG with a few other elements thrown into it:
- Mobile suit/armor development (i.e. you can change a leveled robot into another one)
- a few ""idle"" missions to help gather exp/funds (aka offline missions, but you need internet connection to start/finish them)
- a simple custom character creation with 8 models for male & female + alternate ""hidden eyes"" version, for a total of 32 models. (you can write a profile for them and select bday+blood type that defines their skillset+growth type)
- non-linear stage progression. you can play any scenario you want from the start, but you must finish one chapter before starting the next. (let's say there's scenario A, B and C, each with 10 chapters. to play chapter B3, you must first finish B1 then B2, and then B3 will be available, but there's no need to finish A before playing B). 
- You can also select difficulty (change rewards and enemy abilities and stats) and replay the stages as much as you want to get exp/resources (better done with dispatch missions) and unlock new units (read: characters/units from the main series) for production.

About the DLCs: they add units, characters and parts with THE DISPATCH MISSIONS ONLY. there's no new story/playable mission in them. They also give better exp/capital. Unless you want to buy all of them (or the season pass), you can pretty much get the same benefit by choosing only one of them, as the dispatch missions are limited to a max of 3 groups (and you can only have 4 groups total at any given time), so adding tons of dispatch missions don't do much (the rewards are their top selling point tho). Take this in consideration before buying the DLCs.

TL;DR: It's like a single player gacha game tactic rpg xDD

One thing that I will state is once you've completed one of the stories the game starts to get a bit too easy if you try to complete via each story.  expect to bench people from time to time just to keep some of it a challenge, and jumping up to extra difficulty.",1584849678,1584849678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

SD Gundam G Generation Crossrays is a fantastic turn-based strategy game set in the alternate universes of the Gundam Franchise.  Allowing you to play from the classic Wing to the newest Iron-Blooded Orphans.  It contains a HUGE amount of mobile suits and Gundams from the deferent series and each can be leveled up and finely tweaked to make it the perfect machine for your MS pilots.

The game has a high level of content before worrying about replayability but even then each campaign mission has 3 difficulty modes making the enemies you face much more threatening. 

My only complaints are the cutting of some story elements from the campaigns, ex the love triangle between Kudelia, Atra, and Mikazuki from IBO, it's mentioned in the final part but isn't much talked about throughout. The second is a lack of skirmish type modes, where you simply just fight a large group of enemies, this or a career type mode where you can take random missions for money or other Mobile Suits I feel would help the game but that is just my personal opinion. 

In the end, this game has taken someone with a basic understanding of what Gundam is into a super fan, successfully making me want to keep watching the shows, picking up the side story mangas and building gunpla... lord help my wallet... 

SD Gundam G Generation Crossrays easily gets a strong 9 - 10, I've only rated a 9 as I've experienced 3 crashes at seemingly random and the lack of that career/skirmish mode.  However, it is fully worth the full price if you are interested in Gundam or would like to get into Gundam like I was.",1584840849,1584840849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you know Super Robot Wars, it's kinda like that but with only Gundams.

Pros
- A metric sh*tton of available Mobile Suits, Mobile Armor and Warships as well as a massive amounts of pilots to build your Battlegroups out of.
- Pretty Hype Battle animation for most of the attacks
- Fully Voiced Characters for Battle animations/some of the ingame Story elements
- A real good amount of Content to lose yourself in
- Fully customizable soundtrack, aka you can use whatever music you want as long as you have it you can have it played for character/battle/background themes

""Meh""s (things some might dislike whilst others dont mind them):
- Some people might be put of by the SD (Super Deformed) Looks (I personally did at the beginning but it grew on me)
- The Mission can be REALLY long (up to and more than 1 hour), but you can quicksave in them so its fine.
- The game doesnt autosave, so saving manually is required.
- ""Create a character"" is laking in the amount of portaits you can use.

Negative:
- A mode called Group dispatch that reminds of Mobile Game wait-missions with missions of 15+ hours where you cannot use your assigned group for that amout of real time. I know its used for ""Gonna head to bed/work, lets have my dudes level up/find stuff in the meantime"" but it doesnt sit well with me.

In my eyes worth it if you like the shows that are featured in them, however some of the suits/pilots/abilities will, if obtained ""too early"", make some of the games missions quite the Cakewalk.",1584047305,1584047305,True,17,0,0.664376437664031982,0,True,False,False

Given ive played this for a while now - 

There's several things i dislike 
1. Lack of content - like Overworld had group attacks that were unique per character interaction - Crossrays really lacks that uniqueness
or okay DLC's make em interesting!!! Lack of DLC too
2. Doesn't have Random battles option for capturing (i lvoe the previous versions of random battles for mindless destructions)
3. After end game kinda sucks nothing to do.

If you like Fire Emblem or SRW type of games - fun !
IF YOURE A GUNDAM FAN !!! GET IT!!!


EDIT:

So playing this for a week now I was really excited, this reminded me of good overworlds but felt like less content but given that there will be DLC coming, but i do like about this is that this game gives other series that limelight instead of UC.

As someone who works full time throughout the week, this game is perfect. The actual missions don't last too terribly long, and every moment can be a ton of fun. I generally don't like turn-based games or strategy games, but for whatever reason Cross Rays resonates with me. I'd imagine it's the amount of content and my drive to unlock everything I can that keeps me coming back. An endless amount of Gundams and items to unlock makes replaying levels worth the effort. That being said, I've yet to actually complete all of the playable content.

One of the best parts for me are the Dispatches. If you haven't purchased the game, or done any research, a Dispatch is where you can send your groups out to do missions over a certain amount of time. Like I said, for someone who works full time, this is an amazing feature that lets me see results even though I haven't been actively playing the game. Before I go to work I can send my groups out on Dispatches, and come home to see what they've earned. Even dispatches that last less than 8-10 hours are great because I can use programs, such as Google Desktop, to Dispatch my groups from work. I've seen a few gripes about the DLC being Dispatch only, but for me I think it's amazing. Of course, this is up to each player's actual lifestyle, and I can understand how paying for DLC that can only be accomplished by waiting is a disappointment.

As for the quirks: the only actual bug I've come across is the game inexplicably crashing at the very beginning of new story arcs. This isn't a huge issue, as nothing has been done yet, and I simply have to reload the game and the level to continue. While mildly frustrating, it doesn't take away to much from the game overall. On the few times the game has crashed in the middle of the level, each turn is saved, and relaunching the game will more or less put you back right where you left off. My friends have seldomly experience this issue, so it might just be an issue for me.

I have played this series of games since SD G Generation War, and each iteration has changed the game and not all of it has been for the better. However, this game does get a lot of it right. The introduction of Raid Set-up is a definite benefit, no longer having to worry about having a ship with a full crew just to field a second group helps immensely. Another big change is the addition of Group Dispatch. This... is a mixed bag to me. I love that they implemented something for people who do not get to play much, as this dedicates one or more of your groups for X amount of time and you get rewards like money, XP, new suits, etc. But I think this system is part of the reason everything else is so overinflated. The cost to get a decent ship is staggering, something that I wouldn't consider feasible in a single run of a storyline. Also, Group dispatches are the best way to level and evolve your suits, as the amount of experience to get to the next level seems higher as is the level required to get new suits. If you just play the game and not use group dispatch I am not sure how much fun you will have. Using group dispatches makes level suits childs play, especially the daily training dispatch. But then you don't get the experience of using a suit and the struggle of leveling up your Leo to get the Talgeese, then the Epyon. You can just send it on several dispatches and suddenly, high tier suit. Finally, I feel like the matches take longer than they did in previous games. The amount of enemies, how easy they are to kill, and difficulty all seem the same. The changes are in animations(if you watch them) and in-between turns. So much goes on that didn't used to distract you like the raid units getting energy, so before your turn it takes like two-three minutes of listening and going through all of your units. 

Don't let my negative comments detract from this though, the game is good. I just feel like if you want a better intro to the series, maybe go with Frontier, the previous one. It is also in english if you buy from playasia(not on pc though).",1583237889,1583237889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
728530,64451262,76561198153305861,0,3,13856,0,3402,1633682804,"TL;DR    If you're a fan of Gundam, get the game. It hits all the right spots for any Gundam fan that has seen/read Wing, SEED, 00, and IBO. The game is a TRPG, so think of it as Fire Emblem, but with mechs and a larger number of enemies to deal with in large maps. Lots of characters and mechs to get, especially with the DLC. It's definitely going to hit 100+ hours of game play in order to 100% this game, but it'll be worth it. The game does have it's problems, so be mindful of that.
 
Okay, as many of the comments suggest, if you are a Gundam fan, just buy it. It's one of the best games we've ever received in a very VERY long time. Probably since the PS2 days of when Gundam games were coming out. There are other SD Gundam games out there, but it's Japanese only, which is a crime. Those games include U.C. timeline Gundams and whatnot.

The game as a TRPG, is fine. It does get very repetitive after a few hours. Especially when characters and mechs are doing the same animation over and over again. The only real reason you, mainly myself, would watch the animations, would be for the characters you've scouted in the game, as well as your custom characters the game let's you make, albeit a very limited customization. Still, in terms of depth, it's not too deep, but for newcomers of this genre/game, it is very overwhelming. If you've played games like Langrisser back then, you'll be fine. For those who've played Fire Emblem, this is going to be an obstacle you get through or it might turn you off. Seriously, having to keep track of your units, which comes to a total of 8 per 4 formations. 2 being mechs while the other 2 being ships having mechs inside, it can be very hard to keep track of them. Not to mention the amount of enemies they unleash at you. It's ridiculous. Let's also not forget the maps and just how massive they can be. Some are small, but some are really big. Making it that much harder to keep track of your units and the enemies.

The music in the game is very good and the upgrade in art style for some of the characters, mainly for Wing, is a treat to watch as they eliminate their enemies. There is no dub, which is fine, it's not really needed for a game like this.

This game can be challenging, but at the same time not. The latter being that there is a real time quests, that you can have 3 out of the 4 formations do. Each one having different difficulties as well how long they will take. Doing so will grant you money and exp for your pilots and mechs. So, before you stop playing the game, have a formation or 2 do a quest. 

It's certainly a long game with missions sometimes taking over half an hour long or longer. It's mainly due to which formations you use as well as the absurd amount of enemies spawning in.

Wound up losing three of my starting units which while not all that strong, are still leagues ahead of the stuff you can build at first. Took a bit of reading online to figure out how to register them in the production list. The tutorials do not inform you of anything pertaining to this. Also, when you use the design feature to combine two units to get a new unit in the production list, you won't actually lose the two units you used, which also isn't touched on.

As for the positives.

The game itself is more then entertaining for a typical Gundam fan.

For those that have never played a SD Gundam G Generation game before, it's the perfect mixture of Fire Emblem and Pokemon. You follow the stories of the four main alternate universes (Wing, SEED/Destiny, 00, IBO) and their side stories. There are well over 650 units for you to acquire and plenty of pilots. You can create your own character, recruit established characters, and build the dream team you always wanted.

This game is a massive improvement over Genesis. Animations and models have been built from the ground up. The game renders at a beautiful native 4K with a constant 60 FPS. The action is top tier and miles above anything offered in Genesis. Custom BGM allows you to import your own music. The stories are what you know and love and are retold faithfully.

The bulk of the content are in the story missions that play out in abridged form the stories of the 4 aforementioned series and their spinoffs and sub-series. These missions are accompanied by challenges and quests to complete which unlock additional suits and characters to use.

Overall, Cross Rays is an enjoyable experience, but it suffers in that the challenge of the game can quickly devolve into a dull grind depending on what suits or series the player does first. If the player does a later series, they can acquire better suits, and at least for me, once I'd acquired those better suits I practically never used the weaker ones, and even the harder difficulties became cakewalks.

However, even if it descends into a dull grind later on, the sheer amount of content, both in missions, quests, and unlockable content means that this game can easily be played for 100 hours or more.

I love this game so much. I expect it was gonna be good and it did not disappoint. The last game genesis was a really fun game I played on the PS4, That game seriously was my favorite gundam game. But this game takes the cake with a lot improved stuff

Story: The story has 4 of the main gundam series Wing, Seed, 00, and Iron blooded orphans and each of them has its own side stories of course the game don't show all of the stuff that happen in the anime and manga and some of them has been altered to set the stage so don't expect much of that but they do hit most of the important stuff that happened in the anime and manga so if you want know the whole story of any one of these series just read the manga or anime. Other then that they did right for these series.

Gameplay: If you played any of the SD gundam games you know the format of the game but for the people who are new here a explanation. Its a turn based strategy game that you can play any of the mobile suits in each of the series in the game. The game itself is really fun with a lot of stuff to do creating and customizing your character to grinding to get your favorite mobile suit to pilot, or beating the stages on higher difficulty or unlocking the characters and warships which ever you choose theirs plenty to do and the replay value is endless 

Music: CUSTOM BGM OMG I have not seen this in a game in a long time and now here is YES you can put any type of music for the whole stage or for your character. Of course the music from the game is good too with bgm from each of the series in the game.

Dispatch Mission helps a lot if your not at home or don't feel like grinding send the group out for a couple hours to get caps, exp, skills and mobile suits. I was a little worried about this system because this could of easily be monetize but bandai didn't go that way and im really happy about that and you can get cooldown items for completing a stage 

Overall: I love this game soo much and i cannot recommend it enough if your fan of gundam this is must have and hopefully this review would help Thank you :3",1579548079,1579548079,True,12,0,0.567676961421966553,0,True,False,False

I love the SD Gundam G Generation series, but since I haven't kept up with the various anime of the four series in this game (Gundam Wing, Gundam Seed, Gundam 00 and Iron-Blooded Orphans) only Wing is the one I'm really familiar with or care about. I was pretty unhappy that G Gundam, Gundam X and Turn A got shafted. In addition, while I greatly enjoyed the previous game SD Gundam G Generation Genesis, I did feel disappointed by things like the severe lack of dramatic pilot cut-ins (i.e. a close-up of the pilot when they attack or dodge). The main reason for that disappointment is because it just made things less visually appealing, since an RX-78 Gundam piloted by Amuro Ray is animated exactly the same as an RX-78 piloted by Sayla Mass, only with a different pilot voice. Cut-ins helped make things feel more dramatic and exciting.

That said, I was partly convinced to buy the game because this is the first time the SD Gundam G Generation series has been released worldwide in English (Genesis was released in English, but only in Asian markets or Asian Playstation Networks). After how dreadful New Gundam Breaker was, I wanted to show there is a market for Gundam games outside of Asia.

The fact that Cross Rays brought back cut-ins in a big way went a long way towards gaining my interest. The new Raid System is also a nice new mechanic (in previous games you had to deploy a mothership carrying your team; with this Raid System you can deploy a squad without a mothership). It feels that Bandai Namco and Tom Create took criticisms of Genesis to heart and made a much more exciting (or at least more visually interesting) game. 

I'm not going to lie, though, the game can be pretty grind-heavy. This is unsurprising for veterans of the series, but it can be a rude shock for newcomers. Weaker machines naturally need less EXP to level up, and are much cheaper to produce. Naturally, they have stats to match. Luckily, with persistent grinding it's theoretically possible to create a Leo with the same durability as even the mightiest of Gundams. 

In addition, this is a complaint I've had about the series for some time, but I do feel that the end battles (i.e. the ones that take place at the end of the various series) tend to feel too small due to things like a relatively small number of enemies (especially compared to SD Gundam G Generation F). The fact that no matter  what ship you bring the most units you can bring is 9 is also kind of disappointing, since some ships like the Libra from Gundam Wing ought to be able to carry far more than that. 

For pros, like mentioned earlier Cross Rays is a very flashy game. Unlike Genesis, the various machines have dodge animations as well as the occasional victory animation (though not all machines have one, and some are only triggered when piloted by their canon pilot). Like other games in the series, Cross Rays also does a competent job of condensing the various animes into a relatively small number of levels (as they often compress 52 episodes or so into 12-15 stages). Also like other games in the series, Cross Rays includes what-if machines that never actually appeared in anime and the like, so you might also get a kick out of seeing the machines that were designed but scrapped from the shows. The encyclopedia can be pretty threadbare when it comes to characters (plus a little spoilery), but they also make for fun reading.

Overall, if you like Gundam series and want to watch all sorts of flashy attacks, have heroes (and villains) from various series fighting side by side, or just get an abridged version of the events of each series, you could do far worse than giving SD Gundam G Generation Cross Rays a try.",1579254124,1579254124,True,1,0,0.49785536527633667,0,True,False,False

Your main focus is going to be developing your ""Organization"" while completing missions that follow the stories of various Gundam franchise timelines. Your organization is the hub for your MS team groupings, equipment development, and pilot training. As you progress through missions, you'll acquire capital (currency) for your org. and experience for your mobile suits, mobile armors, warships, pilots, etc., improving the stats of all of them and unlocking new tech and pilots as you progress.

The learning curve is incredibly steep, and there's a lot that the game doesn't outright explain to you. If you wanna figure out the deeper end of your tactics in battle and decision making when it comes to running your org, you may have to ask for help or research online... or be like me and just bash your face against it until you figure it out. And when you do get the hang of everything, it starts to feel incredibly rewarding.

There are countless missions and most of them will make you say ""Holy crap, how am I supposed to survive this?"" when they launch. It makes you feel incredible after annihilating massive groups of enemies with only your wits and a handful of skilled pilots. Refreshing, and it does the franchise's over the top battles justice.

Do you enjoy oldschool turn based strategy?  Can you overlook some rough bits of rough presentation for an otherwise pretty enough experience?

This is a very niche game for fans of the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise.  I say that, but it's geared more towards those who have watched the more modern shows (and shows that the west have more experience with).  No Universal Century (barring one special machine); this focuses on Gundam's Wing, SEED, 00, and Iron Blooded Orphans.  Your enjoyment of this game is tired very closely to how much you enjoyed those series.

Each series is given a handful of stages, plus additional stages for sidestory series like SEED Astray or 00F.  Often, the goal of each stage is to kill all enemies on the map, but there are some other variations (ensure X unit reaches goal, survive X turns, etc.)  To complete these stages, you are given the ability to recruit a team of pilots to ride machines in to battle, either deployed from a ship or as a loose raid of units.  By defeating enemies, you earn skills and complete quests that unlock more characters and machines.  You also level your deployed pilots and machines in the process.

Combat is fairly straight forward:  You tell a unit to attack another unit on your turn, the computer does likewise on their turn.  You can view a animated clip of your machine and pilot combo(s) performing the actions you specified.  The attack you perform can be a units specific attack (which can be supported by other team members in range), or you can use a link attack.  Ships and raids initiate link attacks differently, but the outcome is the same: Links are extremely powerful when used correctly (some would say overpowered).

You can have up to 4 teams, but only 2 can be deployed at once.  What do you do with the other 2 teams?  You can send them on Dispatch Missions, which a timed deployments where your group attempts to complete a simple mission with no use interaction.  The success is measured on the quality of units deployed, with a bonus given if you meet the mission requirements.  This can help you get parts, skills, more machines to pilot, and experience for your fallow crews.

The package all the game is presented in is slightly archaic.  Mouse and keyboard controls a pretty rough, which is odd to say for a turnbased strategy.  I found playing with a controller easier, as exiting menus and selecting specific menus faster and easier.  There is a button shortcut for everything.

There are some performance issues (as of this writing).  I have hit some crashing when viewing attack cutscenes, as well as encountered texture rendering issues if I try to run it on integrated graphics.  The most annoying issue for me is the window of time that button presses are registered when opening and closing menus.  There is some optimizations that the game could still use (audio hitches loading off an NVME drive shouldn't happen), but it is far from being unplayable.

Should you buy this game?  It's exactly what it says on the tin: If you like Gundam and you enjoy turned based strategy you'll probably have fun.  Maybe not at full launch price; 80 CAD/60 USD feels a little steep for a game such as this.

A shame that it only explores some of the Gundam series, but there's a lot of characters and mobile suits to unlock and improve. Custom pilots are a nice touch but their stat growths don't keep up with more prominent characters, so you'll need to invest credits if you want to fulfill your Gundam self-insert power fantasy.

The game does a poor job of explaining stats and how they affect combat. For example, points in, say Ranged for example, claim to affect accuracy but also affect damage. Warship combat stats are based off of the captain whilst the stats of the crew are added on to the captain's stats. 

Strategy is somewhat simplistic; it mainly comes down to Pilot + MS/Warship stats and positioning. If you're looking for factors like terrain and stage hazards you'll be dissappointed. Terrain only affects how many spaces your units can move on a given map.

There's a wide selection of MS available since the game draws upon side stories on top of the main series. There's also some MS unique to the SD Gundam games that are pretty interesting (I put Lacus Clyne in a Haro Mobile Armor and replayed the Gundam Seed story just to flex on ZAFT). Main character suits are obviously stronger than mook suits but theoretically you can invest credits in any MS to keep up in stats.

All in all, a really good Gundam game if a tad light on strategy. 

Pro Tip: When starting out, DO NOT start with the IBO storylines. Nanolaminate Armor is a thing, and your stating MS feature almost entirely beam weapons.

I like the Dispatch feature well.  You basically send your team out for hrs at a time to gain xp/parts/money.  This help you to level weak units so those could develop into other MS.  It's good if you want to collect all units.

As stated before, I have updated the review. I did not get another steam copy, but I manage to get myself a switch copy since I prefer the portability (~70hrs gameplay). Note that my review will be based on the fact that I have not played Genesis yet (I can easily recall playing Wars, World and Overworld).

Overall the game has finally received its much needed improvements, better graphics, mechanics and storyline. The stories, although only 4 series, are very in-depth and - with a little imagination - captures a lot of the subtle nuances of each character, situation and how they develop respectively. However i do feel in certain times, I would just prefer a shorter version of the story just for a quick refresher since I remember the scene from the anime/manga quite well. 

The raid and warship link attacks are interesting and makes the game feel a tad more challenging. I find myself using the raid groups more than warships just because I prefer a faster gameplay where any gundam can trigger a raid-link attack. However, since many of the stages have tons more enemies, you are forced to use raid or warship link attacks anytime possible. But since the developers force you to do this on nearly all the stages, it becomes a bit too repetitive at times.

What I wished was still here was the extra turns that you get for the pilot having higher levels, as well as the multi attack skill. While I understand this was not implemented for the sake of game balance, I believe that we should still have this to add more variety to the game - i.e. add an extra turn for every 20/30 levels, or you can use multi attack, but the EN consumption will be multiplied by the number of enemies being selected for up to 4 enemies (just for thoughts).

In addition, I believe that the game is a bit biased towards the 00 series gundams. Try comparing the a qant full saber with a wing zero ew. By base stats, the qant full saber definitely has the upper edge, however both are top tier gundams that should have similar - if not - rivaling stats. This applies to many other top gundams as well such as the ELS qant. And some -supposedly powerful- gundams, such as the Epyon and Lupus Rex, have very limited variety of attacks, which just seems very dissapointing. 

And this may sound idiotic, but I prefer having the option to get the UC series gundams through design or develop. I understand that Genesis was meant to fulfill that role, however it is still a nice option to be able to get a banshee through developing a psycho haro at level 16 (an example). I am not asking for a complete set, but just enough to balance out the games even more while also providing more alternative strategies.

Overall, while I seem to have more complaints/feedback than positive reviews, I definitely am enjoying the game and will continue to play it until I finish the game. If you want to more positive reviews, go look at other people's review. But definitely this is a new and interesting take for the sd gundam g generations series, and one I'll gladly play through.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

One unsettling nuance for me is that this game makes you spend a lot of time watching and listening to the stories, but at the same time forces you to repetitively wipe out all enemies and use raid or warship link in a lot of battles. So this becomes a negative factor - the game developer should choose either to focus on more interesting strategies and goals or the stories that are being portrayed, OR to provide options for the user to select either one ( i.e. short story option). but since I am a gundam fan and enjoy the stories a lot, I don't mind the wait and goals of the stages. Just note that because of this, definitely not everyone will enjoy this game, including some gundam fans out there.",1574924448,1577972003,True,0,0,0.416154265403747559,7,True,False,False

One of the main draws is the great attack animations for all the mechs. They have great variety and are impressive to watch more than once. But you're always able to skip them if you grow tired of watching.

There is a lot of customization to be had here as they offer tons to work with the ways of party roster, mechs, and equipment, and skills. You can even customize theme songs for when your characters take action.

The flow of gameplay is you go through retellings of stories from Gundams Wing, Seed, 00, and Iron Blooded Orphans. For the most part it's just still images and text telling you a story you might already know, but they do occasionally reanimate some scenes in 3D. You can approach the series in any order you wish so your difficulty curve will vary depending on how you approach it.

The game also features a system called dispatch where you can have your characters go off on missions while you are not playing to get exp, items, skills, and mechs to use. Be advised that you can't use those characters in other content while they are dispatched here.

I skipped most cutscenes in this game and took advantage of dispatch a bit too much which let me power through everything even on extra difficulty. I ended up finishing all stages at around 110 hours because of this. Gameplay time will vary a ton depending on how you approach the game. When you finish everything you unlock an additional difficulty mode which offers a reason to go back and replay missions at a higher difficulty for better rewards.

If you answered yes to at least 4 out of 5 of these questions then this game is no doubt for you. Otherwise look into these things and make your decision from questions 1 through 3.

This game also allows custom soundtracks so you can make it sound even more bada** if you want to, but I'v e found quite a few tracks that are actually already good enough as is. This game does the gundam series justice so I'd recommend checking it out.

Also if you're not playing there are sorties you can do unlike in most other games so you can still grind while you're not playing. However, there is a limitation on this ie. you cannot be in the middle of another mission and start a sortie. This is to prevent obvious abuse of the system, but you can start a sortie then use another group for a storyline mission so using it doesn't lock you out of playing the game. Just thought I should mention that here because it is somewhat important to understand. Same goes for starting a new mission if you're already in a mission, that wipes the old mission too, so keep that stuff in mind. 

(Simplified: If you start a new mission sortie then the current quick saves will be deleted and you'll have to start over if you were in the middle of a mission so finish that first then do w/e)

Not much else to say about this game, it appeals to a niche audience and if you're in that audience this game is a must buy.",1577399479,1577399479,True,42,1,0.748001396656036377,3,True,False,False

Pros:
- The Combat Animation looks very good and smooth
- Have a replay value
- No technical issue like CTD or gamebreaking bugs (at least for me)
- So many mechs i don't even know exist like ELS Qan[T] & Talgeese F
- So many scenario to choose from
- You can put a Custom BGM & make your own custom characters

Cons:
- The game itself is heavy Grind (Need to replay Scenario a Lot for Lvling up your Mechs)
- Sometime Stuttering after doing Raid Combination Attack or Warship link Attack
- no UC timelines

Pro
- good cg animation  of the battle

- if you never see the animate, you cna enjoy the story




Cons
fun at early stage , boring and tedious in late game
when i finished less than 1/3 of the game , i basically get all the unit that can be developed or design. 
the rest only can get them during mission 

- this is game play is totally hash and slash after i get all the unit 

-AI love to camp so much, even on EXTRA difficulty. 
some defense mission, they are not trying to attack until the last round

- overpower of the battleshipe link attack, lock up to 9 unit , can be used 1 per round. 
this make the game boring. if you not using this, you need to spend time to kill many unit in 1 stage .can be more than 50 units , may be up to 80

- allowing edit all the unit and pilot attributes make the game too easy and no characteristic. 
pilot is more like changing the avatar only. you throw money to edit . they can be as powerful as any heroes in game

-totaly 79 stages. that is too much and not necessary.  not feeling playing game, but doing tedious job

-pilots that have different stage (season 1, season 2 OVA) consider as different pilot
that make the OVA version is stronger than season 1. if you play linear , it is annoying you get the same character but different version . you may waste time in lv up a weaker version of character

-no borderless full screen, alwasy get the task bar overlay on the game

With 11 different story campaigns all with their own stages, characters, and enemies you'll have more than a few different battles to test your squads against.  

You can build up to 4 different parties.  There's an auto grinding feature so you can send up to 3 parties at a time off to do missions of their own that will complete in real time.  Whether you're on the game or not.  This is very helpful for someone like me that doesn't have as much free time as I'd like to grind all my parties individually.  

Story missions will follow specific subseries of Gundam Anime and your parties will assist the main characters of those Anime in completing their missions.  

There's been some free DLC that gives you a pretty useful extra mobile suit and its pilot.  Both of which originally appeared in a Wonder Swan Color game.  The best kind of helpful throwback.

Also the music is great.  Lots of original new songs, remixes of old video game BGMs, and even a lot of BGMs from the Animes themselves.

The game was good we have need animation with really good quality Graphic and have all series Gundam in 1 game. But for Gundam fan Especially for  Gundam 00 and Gundam Seed series, I will not recommend this game at all not because the game crash or something wrong in running game but due to the way the game build this unit on the series. 

For Gundam 00 series we all know that unit from the 00 movie is the best unit in all series and many character that also love by fan and now the game make it totally like are joke :
1. Allelujah Haptism and Hallelujah Haptism is 1 person not 2 and that game make we mistake there was 2 when you buy those character in unit list(you can hear the voice both of them When they driving their MS but the name only 1)
2. The Harute Gundam have 2 system is Trans-arm and Marute Mode and their are like 2 difference system so if i compaire the Marute Mode with the other system i will says that the Marute Mode look like Zero-system from Gundam Wings series so don't combine them with the Trans_arms
3. 00-Qantar have the Raiser Sword attack like 00 raiser Gundam so if you don't put it in that is a totally mistaking
4.Zabanya Gundam is not a sniper unit anymore so the Map weapons of that gundam should look like Freedom 
For the Gundam Seed fan this game no more than insult for the whole series than a new good things:
1. Ginn have 3 pack of weapons not are totally new unit so why the game want us to research the 3 type of  GINN unit instead of have GINN then refit it like Strike Gundam or Impusle Gundam( the game also repeat the same mistake with Zaku Warrior in later)
2. Zaku Phantom also install Wizard Pack like Zaku Warrior (they says it on the unit profile but in the reality only Zaku Warrior have the pack Zaku Phantome want to have it have to be pilot by Series character like : Yzark, Dearka, Rey and Lunamaria)and have a hand grenade but noboy have chance to use them with unit have the pack.
3.  Muramasa have a tail like normal aircraft when in fly mode but in Database somehow the tail disappear (you can still see it in the unit when it in a map and in animation).
4. Astray Red Frame Custom have the Tactical Arms that can transform into a Big Sword like Astray Blue Frame Second Revise so where is that ?(i know it because i also have the figure of Astray Red Frame Custom Gundam on real life everyboy play Gunpla all know it)
5. Mars Jacket unit in the profile last phrase say that the unit have a beam twin sword rifle which unifies a Beam Naginata and a Beam Rifle so where is the Beam Naginata so where is it ? and the unit can be Purge into a difference unit (like Virtue Gundam )so why transfer that into a attack ?
Lastly some unit in game have 2 pilot and for some reason untill now after so many series SD Gundam Generation the game still have only 1 pilot fot those unit

I hope Namco Bandai will fix this mistake in upcoming update (i don't know if they will do that or not ) because i don't want to write a not recommend this game for people who also like this series like me.",1574926826,1576947535,False,1,1,0.408528566360473633,4,True,False,False

At launch it was literally unplayable with a damage bug akin to a dev easter egg for those who wanted to illegally download it which thankfully lasted only 2 hours. but now, everything works perfectly fine ingame and i have only had one crash since that initial trouble.

on gameplay its the same turn based strategy game like all the others i've played from the G Gen line up, but using most of the mechanics from the previous entry, genesis, which is not on pc. and i dont know if genesis did this as well, but it starts you off with only G gen characters and suits along with some grunt suits from the included timelines. this isnt too bad but its not great if you wanted to jump in with say... wing gundam and have basic versions of the gundams to start with and develop down those paths.

on the units themselves, the stats are higher than my previous G gen game, Overworld, and play a much smaller role towards total damage. skills on your pilots on the other hand have a much more significant impact where i have seen a unit do double their damage output just by adding in some skills to their pilot.",1576663855,1576663855,True,3,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

- Custom characters now have face (previously they've darkened eyes and look like hentai VN hero/heroine)
- Amazing Animation
- Emphasize on battle formation
- Tekketsu no Orphan/Tekketsu no Orphan Gekko/00F
- Dispact means less grinding (this feature is online only)

BAD:
- Raid Unit is too over powered and illogical (robot without any repair system able to regenerate huge amount of HP), thankfully you can always use Warship Unit if you still want some challenge (warship is expensive though so you're forced to use easy mode for a while .. or deploy only 1 unit)
- Missing pilots, 00P have it really bad with at least 2 of it's main characters missing
- Missing mechs, ex: Dantalion only have 1 variation
- Missing weapons, ex: lots of units in Tekketsu no Orphan/Tekketsu no Orphan Gekko only have 2 weapons
- Only have 4 main series with incomplete side series
- Tifa is a New Type but you can't get New Type ability for other characters.
- Awaken stat is useless now unless your mech has new-type like weapon (funnel, bits, fang, etc). No more bonus to evasion/hit rate
- No Gundam Build Fighters/Build Fighters Try (only 2 mechs from Buid Fighters is in the game and 0 pilot)
- Dispatch missions are doing a good job lessening the grinding but to counter that, Pilot's Ability need to be farmed now.

NOTES:
- Lots of things in the BAD categories can be fixed with free patches (missing weapons/mechs) and DLCs (missing side stories and adding more main series) but sadly Bandai choose to not bother.

- New dispatch mission system is very good for upgrade a weak unit and farming money to buy the expensive warship

- Warship can deal damaged as it should be
- Custom character have a portrait not only the Shadow anymore and the variety of voice actor for choosing is very wide.

If you happen to be experiencing crashes while playing on a laptop which has both integrated graphics and dedicated graphics, you may want to try setting the game to use the dedicated graphics card. With Nvidia GPUs, for example, you may want to go to the Nvidia control panel to add the game to use the high performance Nvidia processor.

I used to have crashes pretty often, but I haven’t had any crashes after making this change.

I have played every G Generations and this one I could not even play because everytime i start a mission or watch the animation or even in a main menu the game would not stop crashing. please fix this bug and its getting on everyone's nerves.

Everytime you use a skill of any kind the game would not stop crashing, you would have to keep skiping the animation and still crashing even when i am using any special skills still crashes.",1574915882,1576117623,True,0,0,0.417857617139816284,1,True,False,False

will update review when bug get fixed

EDIT:

now that we got update, i guess i should update my review

this is a generally a step up from genesis,although there are some draw backs,

pro: 
-combat improved a bit, not major improvement, but still enough that i could feel
-simplified certain aspect of character development, now you can just spend capital instead of points,
-dispatch mission is a interesting attempt 
-now you don't have to fill the entire gauge from zero to max in one mission in order to add certain units to your production list, this gauge no longer reset
-new way to create a team is always welcome
-sd gundam is now on PC, yeah!
-quick reaction to bugs

con:
-obvious inexperience with releasing game on pc
-UI could use some more work

personal opinion:
-could have used a wider selection of titles, especially once with iconic and impactful finial boss
-dispatch mission could become distractive from actual game play

Crossrays shows that Bandai eventually had caught up to modern standard we expect in video games nowadays,
in terms of graphics, mechanisms etc. And the tactics is simple but fun. 
What I enjoy the most is building my dream teams with units from different universes
and the satisfaction from unlocking new units by developing bottom tier white troopers all the way to the white devil ~ Gundam!
There are special lines and moves for multiple combinations of units and characters so there are many Easter eggs for you to discover. 
This is what fan service is for. 
Expect to spend 180 hours for 100% completion. 
This game is fully packed with faithful recreation of the original animes, as well as epic battles and ass kicking moves.
But this game isn't perfect, there are problems in scenarios and level design,
For example, the plots skip through the best parts...No Aegis vs Strike in SEED? Really?
And 00F is just awful... the worst non-sense side story I have ever read. A terrible choice.
Should have included more SEED/SEED-D MSV or Astray scenarios instead.
00 movie could even put me into sleep with a hundred pieces of stainless steel!!! Lazy enemy design.
And Orphans' sightly edited finale is still painful to watch. R.i.p. 
And some characters are missing from the scout list, for example Wang in 00, Chairman from SEED-D, Haro...
those characters are recruitable in previous titles so I can't see why they never show up.

Haven't finished it yet. So far I finished about 1/4 of all scenarios and unlocked about 27% of all units.

My summary so far:

Pros: 
+ lots of iconic gundams from 4 timelines
+ over the top battle animations are nice to watch 
+ sanbox game: level, enhance, improve you mobile suits, warships and pilots as you like
+ lots of scenarios tied together following losely the story of various gundam movies and series
+ custom charactor creator! (though only a small choice of potraits)
+ lots of content will keep you busy (with 56 hours in I just finished all of After-Colony-Timeline
+ several difficulty levels and lots of opportunity to play you own challenge runs

Cons: 
- lazy mission design: most of the time you face just one(!) unit type + a villian mobile suite on scenarios, barely use of any terrain as a game factor
- all scenarios are losely coupled to movies and series; if you haven't seen the works they based on, you will sometimes scratch your head of why something is happening (well, and sometimes the origin material is at fault - some gundam shows had a awfull story...)
- if you an expert tactical player and use every leg-up the game provides you, you will find this game too easy (I encourage you to play you own challenge runs)
- no original story: everything story-wise you will see here has been told before.

What I would have wished for: 
- a scenario editor: that would be so awesome - especially as most scenarios offer only such a lame range of opponents...",1575834517,1575839707,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

review under this, partly because it is my first ever steam review I have done, but mostly because I still stand behind it.  Yes it is a great game, it has just the right amount of challenge, and the list of mobile suits is superb, especially for a Gundam nut like me.  But the fact that this game would just crash (seven times in just ONE HOUR!) after downloading, with a patch note that said it fixed it, when its not fixed on there end, leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  

Well here is some actual pro's and con's that have to do with the actual content, and not tech jargen.  

Pro: Looks great.  
Last's more than long enough to justify the price point.  
Massive selection of both suits and piolts to pick from.  
Much tougher than it's sister series Super Robot Wars.
If you don't pay attention than the enemy on higher difficulty, will kick the crap out of you.  

Con:  While the battle animations are cool, they will sadly grow very repetitive
, especially if you happen to like a smaller, non gundam suite  who only have a beam saber, and a mechine gun/ beam rifle can get old quickly.  (Personal tip, skip the basic battle animations unless it's the first time you use it, is defentaly going to kill an enemy, or is being used against the boss of a fight.  With the number of enemies on a battlefield it is very easy to get burnout from seeing the same animation so many time in the same fight.)  
No G Gundam.  Aside from being my 2nd favorite Gundam series, the large selection of Gundams in that series that fight with there fists in CQC would have been a great balancing for all the suits that there main power come from some form of a gun.  (though now that i think about it I guess that what most of the Iron Blooded Orphans are there for.)





Original:
Would have recommended this game in a heart beat... but the crash rate of this game is ridiculous!!! Changing menue's, Crash!  Randomly in the middle of battle, Crash!   A second before I can save, CRASH!!!!  I want more than anything for this game to succeed because I want to show Bandai that there is a audience for this type of game here in the states. (And for the fact that importing is very expensive.)  But this is completely unacceptable!  This is written after there major update, and it despertaly needs another one.  WILL change my recommendation and expand my review after they fix the crashing problem, but till then either skip or wait till next major update.",1575764920,1575828361,True,0,0,0.512195110321044922,1,True,False,False

The first of its kind to focus only on the AU (Alternate Universe) Gundam series, which gives players the option to choose any series they like from the Wing, SEED, 00 and Iron Blood timeline without pressuring the players to choose a linear timeline fashion like the previous entry did. 
*Example, the previous title ""Genesis"" were composed of the UC (Universal Century) timeline series, which follows a linear timeline that naturally advanced the technology in the series. You could skip 30-40 years in future and bring high tech mobile suits in the past but that broke the flow of the game and jarring in some case. With Cross Rays, theres no need to worry about that as units from their respective series can still ""Cross over"" without it begin jarring and breaking the difficulty. 

Pros
-Hundreds of playable units with customizable stats and equipment. Want your grunt unit Leo equipped with Wing Gundam's Zero system? Well now you can!
-Hundreds of playable characters with voice lines and battle cutin along with the ability freely customize stats and abilities.
-Dynamic battle animations and even unique animations depending on the character + situation in battle.
-Custom BGM option. Use your own mp3 file and set it to any character or stages. 
-Create your own character with the ingame preset art and set your characters voice using famous Japanese voice actors (from the gundam franchise) portraying unique personalities. 
-Play scenarios from the spin-off series like Astray, 00F, Steel Moon, and G unit that never received an anime adaption.
-Every Unit and Characters has lore and profile description attached.

Cons
-Minimal PC Port effort: Missing a lot of graphical modifications and adjustments. Biggest issue is lack of resolution support. Has 1080p but skips to 3840x2160. Missing in between resolutions like 1440p or ultra-wide support.

-Season Pass isn't worth it unless you're a huge fan of the units from other AU series. Season pass will include Units, Characters, BGM(*subject to change) and dispatch missions. But no scenarios. There are confirmed to be 4 packs in the season pass and the first two has been revealed (at least on JP) as of 12/2019.  Pack 1 will contain Gundam X, Turn A, and AGE, which will release in 12/2019. Pack 2 will contain Gundam X (villains), Turn A (side characters), Reconguista of G (main) and AGE (second season), which will release in 1/2020.  Pack 3 and 4 is estimated to release on 2/2020 and 3/2020.

-Lack of proper tutorial or in game explanation. The problem with this game is that it assumes the players are already familiar with the G generation game series and doesn't explain it in a player friendly manner. 

Mixed
-Reported crashes and bugs. This will depend on your pc hardware/setting. I had zero issues with this game so far but its understandable if this game doesn't properly function for some players as it is the devs 1st PC port.
-Non-existent UC timeline. Although the point of this game is to only use AU, it can be a downer if you're a UC fan. Hopefully, with this success maybe devs will port over Genesis?
-Game may become incredibly easy depending on how you progress. Because of the capabilities of the 4 main Gundams, they are insanely powerful and easy to obtain early on in the game.",1575795088,1575795384,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Main difference from the last game is the replacement of UC gundam by AU gundam universes; Wing, 00, Seed and IBO are the main series this time around. Also, like in Genesis, side stories to the main series are also included. So you get g-unit, seed astray, 00F and IBO gekko as additional series.

Mechanically, this game add raid groups to the already existing battleship groups. This results in the ability to field units without battleships which regenerate EN and health, depending on their position relative to the rest of their group. It's a new way to manage units and gives a lot more importance to unit positioning. It also jacks up the price of battleships, as you don't need a second battleship to field a second group anymore.

The game also changes the way pilot skills work, as you can now get skills from defeated enemies. This gives you a lot of control to the way you assign skills to different pilots.

As for minor additions, you now get custom BGMs and dispatch missions. Custom BGMs let you use your own MP3s as character songs and works fairly well. Dispatch missions let you send your team on automated side mission which rewards you with cash, XP, new units, augmentations, etc. These have a bit of a cellphone game feeling to them, as you just need to wait a certain amount of time to automatically complete them. However, they do give loads of XP and are a great way to level weaker unit. This is particularly good because it feels harder to obtain new units this time around. Combining blueprints doesn't give new units as often as in G gen genesis, which can be a bit of a pain when you're a completionist.

We also get new, better cut-ins for pilots, a LOT of post-attack special animations for specific weapons and now even faces for custom pilots. That said, the localization can be a bit weird at times, with stuff like Gundam wing's ""Barge"" getting translated as ""Bulge"". Sometimes you wonder if the translators are serious or just trying to meme. Still feels like a good translation, overall.

In conclusion, this is a great new entry in the g generation series of game and you should play it if you like gundams and turn-based strategy.

I find the whole process of developing new suits highly addictive and pretty much spent the first few hours of playing this game just grinding one mission over and over to see what new suits I could develop.  So the following nitpicks are in no way a sign that this is a bad game in any way shape or form, just a few things to keep in mind and hope are better in future releases.

1.  menu for producing new units doesn't display weather or not you already have it in your inventory.  This is really just kind of annoying as if you are trying to collect suits for using the ""design"" function it means you have to navigate back and forth between menus and search through your list of MS's to see weather or not said MS has already been built.

2.  20 Daggers to choose from but specific suit variants locked to pilots.  I use the Seed dagger as an example but this applies universally, to where there are so many recolor or slight equipment change variants of mass produced suits and the there are certain suits variants that are only available if you have a specific pilot in said suit.  Its accurate, but it still feels like padding and unnecessary gate keeping

3.  No combined story mode.  For a game that has the words ""four eras come together as one"" in its tag line, I find it disappointing that there is no SRW/Gundam Dynasty Warriors-esque story line you can play involving all the series literally colliding together.  Sure its neat seeing some lesser known stories that haven't shown up out side novels or manga, but personally I would have really loved to see story that just throws all the characters together in total chaos.

4.  Create a character sucks.  Yeah... the game only give you 5 or so different avatar looks to choose from for each gender plus ""shadow"" versions.  Its pretty lame but maybe dlc will add more.  I would say mods but... well... Japanese devs seem to hate modders.

Overall I do really love this game and am glad to see something decent get a full overseas, cross platform release and really hope that we see more games like this.",1575710402,1575710402,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[No Tutorial]
this game have no tutorial, it becomes game where you need to find your way by yourself or by knowledge of the older game. which is pretty sad considering many people interested since it was on steam

floating particles, but why?

[changing multi-lock with link]
so the new system change MS multi-lock with warship/raid team link-up. which is pretty dumb for me because
1. we have seed, wing, and 00 series which have many big laser animation and they making 1 big laser to only hit 1 mobile suit which is pretty dumb for me. and the link-up animation just becomes something like ""ganging up"" with the random attack.

[good animation]
animation become better 

[good voice acting]
many easter eggs and different voice line when pilot using different ms which is pretty good

[not completed storyline]
there's some storyline incomplete LIKE WHERE THE FUCKING FROZEN TEARDROP REEEEEEEE

Simply put, I enjoy it A LOT! I've found myself staying up WAY past my usual sleeping time just to keep playing till I was to tired to stay awake, it is thoroughly enjoyable and exciting all the while. The visuals are amazing, and if you are a fan of the 00 Series, then you are in for a HUGE treat as you get to unlock the ELS form of the 00 Quanta that you see at the very end of Awakening of the Trailblazer.

You can also get your own Warship, however I only just got my own in the form of Ptolemaios 2 Kai since that ship costs 825,000 Capital and I only just now got it after about 79 hours of total play time and before that I got the ELS Quanta (ELS Quanta costs 460,000 capital so if you want this badass and yet BEAUTIFUL machine, I suggest you save your money, it is in my eyes the most powerful machine in the game and the most visually stunning one.).

That all said I do have a few stipulations.

Some things cost way more then I feel they should vs the amount of money you make from missions, even if you do all the challenges and secret missions within a mission, you wont be making that much money in one mission alone unless you go to specific places like mission 9 of Gundam SEED or mission 1 of Awakening of the Trailblazer of which I hear that Mission 9 of SEED is the best since you can capture ALOT of enemy units and sell them for 400k capital if you capture enough enemy mechs which you do by waiting for them to spawn from their carriers, then you destroy the carrier they came from and they will hold up a white flag (be careful not to end the mission before you capture them all as they will not count as captured unless you go up to them and select the Capture command.)

The high demand of the player to grind out money it isn't actually that bad but it is a lil bit off putting, that said, if you get a machine by combining two mobile suit designs, you can get that new machine from the combination without having to pay, sadly some machines, like ELS 00 Quanta CANNOT be obtained this way.

So aside from all that, the game is A LOT of fun and has quite a few comical aspects, such as being able to fly around in a MASSIVE Haro themed Mobile Armor simply called ""Haro"" and it is darn cute!",1575544191,1575544191,True,2,0,0.524656593799591064,0,True,False,False

In fact, the patch was released within one business day of the release of the game. But on to the game itself...

[strike]The main issue I see is the lack of ability to manually quick save in a battle. At least, I haven't found such a capability yet. (Help me here, Steam peeps.) This wouldn't be such an issue if[/strike] the scenarios [strike]didn't[/strike] last so amazingly long (which is actually a plus overall). Note that [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013195710]@Raw Shark Text[/url] has provided info on quicksaving in his comment.

Scenarios mix story with combat in an effective manner, and while I've only cleared one story scenario thus far (I spent a fair amount of time just figuring out the controls, which aren't fully explained.), I can tell already that this is a game I'll sink many more hours into.

For those unfamiliar with other turn-based tactics Gundam games (or Super Robot Wars games), the gameplay is much closer to Fire Emblem or Valkyria Chronicles than, say, Advance Wars or Wargroove. Suit destruction is permanent, [strike]although I can't tell if soldiers can be permakilled as well (and am curious to know the answer to that, so feel free to comment)[/strike] but pilots can't be killed. I was able to clear the bonus conditions for the first Gundam Wing scenario along with the main victory conditions without losing a single unit. However, I'm used to other turn-based tactics games and have a passing familiarity with Super Robot Wars (although this is my first G Generation game); so I have a slight advantage over someone completely new to the genre.

Still, I totally recommend this game to anyone looking for a solid sci-fi story mixed with satisfying turn-based combat.

-battle graphic had improved huge lot than Genesis, thus also serve different type of aroma for fans that eventually hunting the spirits from Cross Rays (we all know that we love CE  that's why we get it)
-new system of sending mission (I played the game in chinese so not sure what did it call in Eng) allowed player to save time instead of grinding like robot,  was pretty awesome !!

For those who wish to know, the SD Gundam G Generation is SRPG (Strategy Role Playing Game) where players move units over grid field (noting of bonuses/reductions due to said field and other factors) before moving to beautifully animated battles based on their prep/counter phase choices. Not unlike Super Robot Wars.

However, unlike SRWs G Gen games tend to be VERY grindy. You'll be spending much of your time leveling, modifying, developing, re-leveling, etc your units and powering up your pilots/scouting your favorites to get them to peak you want them to be to challenge the really tough content if not just obtain stuff from your favorite series. However, this makes the game a lot more flexible as a result as you can actually go back to previous stages and challenge the more lucrative ones at higher difficulty to reap better gains and rewards.

Please be warned that the game takes no responsibility for any anger-induced trauma created from the high hit/evade rate from enemies on said higher difficulties.  

Another thing to note for those who HAVE played other G Gen games is that everything and I mean EVERYTHING this time requires the use of Capital ($$) to obtain it. And money isn't easy to amass this time. Luckily, we have dispatch missions, a passive way for players to obtain capital, levels and other possible goodies while they're off doing things in real life. 

Just remember to jump into a daily to supplement actual playing  and you should be okay cash-wise. But even so, make sure the character your scouting/unit your producing is something your actually going to use. 

This leads me to another point due to the cash woes: While you never lose your pilot should their unit be destroyed, the unit you've been powering up is gone for good. You lost a key asset and god knows how much you may have to pay to produce it again. Take advantage quick save/load. No shame in that. The game even auto saves every new turn.

In terms of the game itself, it feels like a decent port so far, and I only experienced FPS drop once throughout my entire playthrough of the 1st stage of Gundam Wing. I also noticed a problem with the game not detecting my controller, but the keyboard controls are good enough that they will suffice until bandai presumably fix it at a later date (fixed with same update as well actually).

In terms of the game, having followed the game's development, I can say so far that the game is a vast improvement over its predecessor, G Genesis, in terms of both production value and level of detail put into it. For example, all gundam attacks now have character cut ins now, as opposed to before, where you had to give the character a specific suit, and only then were there cut ins for a specific attack on that suit. The gameplay is indeed more of the same SD Gundam formula, but new additions such as move all are welcome additions to the series that reduces needless micro and make the overall gameplay experience more smooth. 

Overall Id say the release is somewhat sloppy with issues such as the damage bug and controllers not being detected not being fixed in time, but other than that the game itself is well  made, and well ported, so I really can't say the game deserves having a mostly negative user review score.

The translation's even only KINDA awkward, and they've been on the ball about patching critical bugs. It's really, really good, even if it's expensive.

As for the game itself, it's pretty fun. It's got a ton of units from both the included series and past G Generation originals. It's a nice looking, smooth, solid Turn-based Tactics game with a pretty decent number of missions and a lot of variety in customization of your units, from parts you can attach to your suits, to abilities you can stick on characters, there's a decent amount of choice at your disposal. You're mostly going through the major battles from the included series, I don't believe there's any ""wacky crossover side-story"" hijinks this time around which is slightly disappointing but not a giant blow to it. The group dispatch missions, which are your usual ""send your guys to do neat stuff for however many hours"" mission board-style thing are kind of a... Perhaps unneeded portion since you only get 4 total squads and three can be out getting you shinies, which means you've only got one to deploy on an actual gameplay mission. If you could get more squads it probably wouldn't be a giant issue, but some of them take 12 hours to complete, which might be a bit much.

It runs pretty solidly for the most part (they patched the major crashes extremely fast, like a couple of days, tops, which hasn't been Bandai Namco's track record necessarily, so good work there), not that it's the most complex game out there.

Gundam is one of my favorite series and finally having a entire dedicated game with actual translations (That wasn't modded in) has been such a delight. Really I would recommend this game to any fan of Gundam who just greatly enjoys the series. 

Now that I got past that part, this game focuses mainly on the storylines of Gundam Wing, Gundam Seed, Gundam 00, Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans. This means that it goes through what most people have experienced through the shows but also the side stories that are exclusively just manga. It's very nice to see those units and characters come to life and learn more about these characters that.. If you don't read japanese or it's hard to simply find the manga for it... You probably didn't know existed.  

I enjoy the CaC feature even if it is limited it feels with the looks that you can give your character but it's simply nice to have something next to some of my favorite characters in the series.  The upgrading and advancing units is the same method that they used in their earlier titles of upgrading your mobile suit as it levels up along with your characters, that being said if you get a little to wild you might just end up getting some bad RNG and losing the suit that you've been working very hard on. 

The deployment mode is nice for people who don't have a hour or so to dedicate to every mission. Each mission can be very long and while you can mind-numbingly skip through them.. Which I question why you're playing if you're not into watching most of the cinematic's anyway. Back to the point, the deployment mode allows you to send out your teams to level up, gain money, or even gain units every few hours. This is just nice and improves on some of the grinding aspects and allowing the player to get the units/pilots they want so they can get the most enjoyment they can for their time. 

Overall, I personally love this game. The strategy aspect of the game or the SD (Super Deformed) look can throw some people off but even if it's not worth it at full price. I'd say wait for a sale and give it a chance, you will have hours and hours of content even if you only did every mission once on the easiest difficulty.",1575274020,1575274020,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

优点：
系统更新了一些，新的游击小队机制很赞。
此外人物属性对伤害和命中率的影响变得更明显了，人物和机体成长也更显著。
新增的挂机机制使得我不用专门去刷杂兵机解锁图鉴了，超级好评。
最后新的人物技能机制在每个人物有自己的特殊技能之外可以自由搭配，保持了人物特点的同时也兼具玩家自己可控的自由度，个人觉得比前作强一些。
缺点：
画面提升不大，不像40g体量的游戏。UI巨丑。
游戏内资金获取量相对于消耗量有点少。
首发时出现bug，好在当天就修复了。我是更新后开始玩的，目前没遇到过bug。

总体这是一部高达粉丝向的作品，如果你喜欢高达，极力推荐入手。
作为战棋游戏，队友联动和武器属性的多样性还略显不足，虽然增加了一些新的武装特效，但是总的来说影响不是很大。如果不同机体间可以有更多互动就好了。
相对于上一作更好玩了，希望日后的dlc能更好。

So, since you might heard about, while there was some initial issues during launch, such as damage begin way too high, this is already solved, in fact it was solved, I think a few hour after the problem appear, anyway, point is the problem is solved. I had no crashes or other issues and so far the port is ok.

With this said, my initial impressions where very good, it is a gundam tactical turn based game, with lots of special systems, which add a several layers to the strategic aspect, from stuff which can happen in the tactical level to entire system to create squadrons, put staff and pilots in gundams and ships and so on. Look, you can even create your own OC to hang with Heero, Setsuna and Mikazuki!

Talking about them, must stuff in game is from Wing, Seed  00 and Tekketsu, and it a lot of content, which also inclued bgm too.

Would I recommend this game? you can be absolute sure!

To a fan, this is a nice addition with all the later stories. Good to see the difficulty taken a little more seriously. Not to say 2D is better than 3D, but the animation doesn't match the fidelity.

In fact, Bandai Namco has shown in the past years a decline in the effort and work they put into their games. In older SD Gundam G Gen games, Multilock was a thing(attacks that hit multiple enemies). You didn't have to spend capital for EVERYTHING. In Overworld, once you clear all triggers of a stage, you get chances to capture all the units you used. 

There used to be buttons you could hold DURING animations to speed them up, you didn't have to set it permanently.

You used to use Ace Points for leveling up stats on pilots--now it's more capital?
What even is this network dispatch? Is this a live service now?
They started going downhill with Super Robot Wars after Z1, and now we can pinpoint they started going downhill with G Generation after Genesis...or Overworld.

After the fix, of course, the game is great. It is the best Gundam game on steam, no doubt there.

The game is itself directionless, but I choose to think I'm running a time traveling company of mercs who just wants to make sure the good guys fight enough for me to mass produce thier MS. Most of the time, you'll be hunting that next upgrade or trying to protect your favorite baby leo.

Unit death has a drawback- if destroyed, the machine is lost, but the pilot lives. I find it more entertaining to deploy 9 Grunt suits, and level them up as a group, losing one or two to multiple enemies. It doesn't sting as bad as reloading a save after a Gundam gets destroyed, and feels a bit more fair.

Definitely a game where you make some of your own fun. Animations are smooth and powerful, and some are silly. Barbatos plants his foot in space to apply the mace, after all.

Created characters don't feel shafted, but the selection of avatar is underwhelming but acceptable. You can create 25 characters.

Being able to place your own music in is awesome, and changing the volume to match the game itself is even better.

For those hunting achievements or to 100% a game, this one leaves a ton to be uncovered in total. In game currency from my earnings so far are a bit paltry, but that makes taking care of the machines you do have much more important.

As for machine collection, I'm familiar with every series presented, and just cannot keep track of them all. Trust me that's a great thing, and makes getting a unit id forgotten existed for the 5 seconds it got in anime time or reference very unique feeling. However, if you're hunting your favorite niche suit, I wish you luck finding it's lead tree.

Final thoughts- Any updates or additional bug fixes would be great, and my own gripe is the slow curser movement, and having to zoom the map out from the options menu. The game feels deliberately slow sometimes, but raid and ship multilock attacks make for some much faster clears. If you are a Gundam fan, you should have stopped reading and downloaded the game, and hurl your insults at nameless does who deserve a good missile to the face for self served justice.

While experiencing the different stories available you gain EXP for your Mobile Suits to level them up which raises their stats but also allows you to develop them into new and more powerful units.

Oh booy... This game is giving me so much grief. I literally can't play it which is genuinely sad. I played the hell out of the last installment in the series Genesis. However Cross Rays hasn't been as lovely with me on my Laptop.

One issue I can't seem to get pass is the crashing. I can't even finish the first stage for 00 cause after the cut senses you get your results and on the very next load it crashes 100% of the time for me, I don't know why.. moving through menus to fast causes a crash as well, and performance is horrible. I can't watch the cool animations cause they causes crashes as well lol...

I love the game and think you should still buy it, but just know that even if your laptop(if you use one) specis blow the recommended ones out the water hard playing the game won't be smooth. It'll be jagged. Waiting till they patch this bad boy up is probably the best thing to do, but I still recommend you buy it so you can show Bandia we in the U.S.A want more Gundam. We are pretty lucky to have as much as we got this year, two games with release dates almost side by side is crazy to me.( GBO2 if you were wondering)

side note: I've crashed over 100 times in a span of 2 hours and something odd minutes of play time(over 5 and a half hours of my night from 12am to 5am), got so tired and frustrated I accidentally broke my usb on my controller just lifting my wire up, that's not the games fault lol, but It was something I don't normally do, but after 100+ crashes I got rash.

終於不用FU Bandai啦， 快D去組你自己心目中最想要的隊伍啦～

This is the first Gundam game on PC made by Bandai that didn't F***ed up in terms of Game play, They have improved the visual a lot and I can tell that they spent very much resources on the CG combat animations its all very fluid. But most importantly they have enhance the mechanics of the game from the last game (Genesis). Those who follows the series or like Gundam in general i would definitely recommend it.

P.S. I personally haven't encountered any bugs during my play through.

From the time frame of the SNES SD Gundam G Next Series after getting the patch to play all mobile suits from Stardust Memories to G Gundam Mobile Fighters. It was hard to find a good game though the japanese was easy to get by after memory. I figured this would break open that old feel of SNES battles...man was i taken by storm by it.

Animations for the battles, Loved that idea its graphics great for it and actually a lot better than I hoped it would be.
The turn based no matter what I love the idea and being able to use the specials of one's suits for attacking before on the SNES version had to find certain ones had be at 100% everything basically or even an ACE level.

Did I get far I stared in doing Wing Series got pass the first crash before the patch and was like okay small bits here it can be patched up. Afterwards got to the next mission and now i'm stuck... not because of tactical reasons but because of crashing every time I either move my second suit or even use a skill now. Do i believe its waste of the money for the game, no because i'm a fan of the series. 

Then on top that Music on its like watching the series again well no skipping over thus far. With how Bandai Namco is going about hitting with patches and trying to get everything fixed up I have to say that's quick responses and great because how long as Gamers do we usually did we have to wait for updates or patches to be made...Next game or never happening. 

Will I keep trying to play the game, Heck yeah I will because sure it can get annoying with crashing but I feel like I cannot give a full review until afterward I did my best in each part I'm aware of. So i'm sure I'll have more to say about in the coming week.

I love blowing up zaku's and shanking warships until they blow. Plus with the day 1 patch, less than 60% hit chance on an enemy makes you feel like a god when you evade 24/7.

I run a GTX 1050 graphics card, 8gb ram and an intel Core i7 7th Gen computer which is above the recommended specs.

Recruit a team of notable personalities from Gundam Wing, Seed, 00, and IBO as you play through the events of those franchises. All missions are based on the events of the anime and various spinoff manga, most of those manga having never been translated into english before.

For people familiar with Super Robot Wars, but not G Gen games:

While they have to be unlocked you can eventually field a team with basically any named person from any of the above shows, and put them in any mobile suit or battleship with no restrictions. There is no over-arching plot between the different universes however; the plot sticks strictly to the original storylines. Because of this story critical characters are playable units that always appear on the maps, rather than being forced deployments that you may have forgotten to level up on past maps.

Additionally the mobile suits themselves are not something you invest funds into throughout the course of the game, instead you level them up a few times to unlock a ""development"" into a similar, and more powerful, mobile suit which also unlocks the ability to just buy more of it from the shop. On maps ammunition depletion is a serious concern that will require you to cycle your units back into your battleship multiple times per map, so keeping units in their group formation is necessary.

What's new from G Gen Genesis:

The game now has background idle missions where you can send your backup teams out to get XP and find items, so there's finally a reason to fill out 4 full squads instead of just 2 primary ones. In addition there's a new type of squad that has no battleship, and instead are on-foot mobile suits who gain generous HP and EN based on their positioning. This new group introduces some interesting variation to group attacks, since its now based on the units' distance from each other rather than the battleship's range.

I'm disappointed that salvaging abandoned enemy mobilesuits is much less significant in this game vs Genesis, since that was one of my favorite part of that game's pacing, but the vastly overhauled skill system more than makes up for it. Skills can now be won from specific enemies on maps, and either learned for free by the character that killed them, or saved and given to a character that would get better use from it with a token war capital cost for the training. This is a huge improvement from the random, slow, and incredibly expensive skill learning process in Genesis. The GET gauge now persists between stages too.

There's fewer custom character models now, but the custom character voice choices are amazing, and cockpit cut-ins are now universal instead of being pilot-and-suit specific. As long as you don't hate all 4 of the series in this G Gen you can't go wrong with it.",1574988473,1574988473,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd also like to commend the devs for fitting in as much of the story's content and detail as they've managed.

Edit: patch fixed reported problems game is working now as intended played today for few hours  didin't encounter any bugs so far. Thoe this could be totally avoided if somone cheked the product Pc version before launch. Nevertheles now I'm happy with the game.

So I decided to switch my reviev  to recomended now.

Good stuff:
lots of units to play with
many storylines 
Atack animations
GUNDAMS !!!! f**k Yeah XD FINALY ON PC AND NOT REGION LOCKED !!!
Turn based combat (might not everyone like it but I do)
Customization: roster character / gundams and other combat vehicles to swap switch develop build.

Neutral stuff: 
tips explaining are so so I played without pad so pc navigation its not so good as i would like to but can get used to it.
might get repetetive after some time for some gamers
Bad stuff: 
no 2k/4k resolution  only lower (you can still play this game on those monitors)
textures arent so sharp as should be on PC especialy when you zoom in
UI without a pad is hard to get used to it at the begining hard to navigate to some stuff on keyboard.
no proper tutorial so you can get lost in diferent tabs and what you can do if you didnt play any  other games from the series.

Thats all so far, If you like gundam universe and anime I totaly recommend this game  and if it sell wel, then l hope to see more titles in the near feauture or even older game ports to pc  avaible to everyone on Steam.

gameplay wise it plays mostly like other ggen that said it has some expedition thing which seems abit funky since you have to 'send a team out to do said task' and they get $ and xp and some drops but heres the kicker you have to wait hours to use them again i mean i think after every story mission you get time reducers but they dont reduce much per item.

Presentation-wise, it's a big step up from the prior game in the series, the PS4/Vita/Switch title G-Generation Genesis, thanks to audio and visual tweaks like giving all pilots a cut-in for their attacks.  Difficulty is a bit on the lower side, but a tad higher than the Super Robot Wars series.

Customization such as character creation, I'd give it 5 out of 10.

To address the naysayers, there was a launch day bug (for about an hour) where all damage values were multiplied by about 30x, which was hilarious and unintentional - it was patched almost instantly, but not before a couple hundred people rioted and gave one of the most promising games of 2019 a negative review. Sigh.

***PRE-PATCH REVIEW***

This review could change if Bandai get off their collective arses and fix the game.

I cannot recommend this game. As of launch it is broken, utterly. Units do hundreds of thousands of points in damage and scenarios become unwinnable because your units are simply instantly killed the second they miss or are outnumbered. Custom characters are not created properly and have no skills.

In the game's present state it is unplayable.",1574901722,1574906586,True,190,10,0.899217784404754639,9,True,False,False
