So far this is the only app (other than Anyland which is just too much going on to be useful) where I can create and upload an avatar that represents how I prefer to see myself. It's quite new, so the process of creating and uploading an avatar is still very complicated and buggy. Many people complain that they upload avatars and they can select them, but they never rez. There's also the thing where you have to map every individual part of your body that moves (including each individual finger) to your avatar in the Unity application before you can upload it. On another note, the things you can do in this VR space are fairly limited and static: There's never anything new, so the few demo worlds that are available are all you get, and it gets boring quickly. It's like the devs just arrived at a point where they went ""okay this is enough content, we're done."" At the moment there's no way to change the luminosity of other avatars, so you've got those people who will crank the luminosity to maximum on their models so they glare in your face like direct sunlight. You've also got people who will make gigantic room-filling avatars and stand there waving their arms around in groups of people. While this app is an excellent concept, I see the freedom people have with avatar creation being stifled quite a bit because the way it is now just isn't scalable; the potential for abusive avatars palpable.

You can play VR mode  and or Desktop Mode

Other thing is you can meet new people, Plus they are friendly! (By the way, i didnt know that you can visit their creative worlds, i visted one when i first played this game and it was amazing!)
However, there is most games in VR chat that require just one hand and some games that you need VR only (less they update it, witch it is still early access)

The developers of VRchat are also making the games they have (Capture the Flag, Battle Discs, etc) available in the SDK. This means over the next few months anyone can adapt these games and create new versions of them!

VRchat is a great way to gain exposure to Unity/development...but you can also just have fun and talk to others here.

Pros
Stays pretty active with between 20-50 people at almost any time of day (pretty good for vr multiplayer)
Devs and moderators are really active, helpful, and love to show off what VRChat can offer
A few good CTF style games to play and Tron discs
Open to user-generated rooms so there could be more really fun stuff coming out soon
Easy to grab people from the hub and have them join you in a game
Easy to see what people are already playing or hanging out in
Its totally free
There are rooms where you can hang out and watch youtube videos with people
If a room is full, you can easily create a new instance of that room for new people to join

Cons
You need a pretty good understanding of Unity to create your own content (devs/community are making tutorials though)
Can sometimes be buggy/drop frames but not too often
Not as popular/active as Rec Room
There arent currently a ton of fun games
No user market place or workshop so you can easily download new avatars/etc (i think devs are considering it currently)

And also a bunch of social VR apps, incl. Altxxxxx, HiFi and some others. This one I have to say blows ALL these experiences out of the water - by miles!

Let me see. Today, this Friday night...I have been in a giant show which was excellently done with anime dancers. I climbed about a mile up in the sky with some people and then we dropped down. I have been in some sort of anime/game forest. I have been in a bowling alley which appeared very real, complete with 50s music and disco light :) I have been in a bar with about 20 people and a bar tender busy running around and serving drinks. I have been in an abandoned prison with scary ghosts, traps and all kinds of stuff. We have played games like CTF and we've been in an old Western town where we were the Sherrifs and shot some bad Bandit dudes :)

A lot of fun also with people showing off their insanely creative avatars. I took my headset off later on and realized that I ""experienced"" more things in one single night than a normal person could ever experience in ""real life"" in a night, uh..a week or a month even. This is just frickin' awesome beyond words.

From a technical point of view, the avatars are excellent and VRchat even allows making and importing your own from Unity. Lip sync, eye tracking and all. Some of the best avatars I have ever seen. The entire system seems polished and runs smooth.

VRChat must have hundreds of ""worlds"" including games etc. to choose from since you can browse them for an half an hour and still didn't see them all. This is crazy. Uh, that being said people can also design their own worlds and games and put them in there. Possibilites: Endless. MIND. BLOWN.

And the people are ALL extremely friendly and supportive etc.

This is VR as good as it can get with TONS of fun and infinite things to do. Seriously it's mind-blowingly good.

Avatar movement is the best on the market, and positional audio is amazing....

It is the World’s Fair 24/7 and I’m always looking forward to see what new content users have brought in.   I can’t wait to see what the community will do with game modifications.  

While still in Early Release, VRChat does have its kinks here and there but the team is dedicated to quickly working those out.  This is the only social VR platform I have found so far that is truly living up to my expectations on what I hoped the metaverse would be.

I made many friends that I met and see in RL.
It's a great place to be, you can bring your own avatar if you know a little bit what you are doing, there is a great online community ready to help.
You can design, share worlds... and be yourself!

There are now even games inside VR Chat: Capture the flag or bandits stealing gold  FPS style, karaoke, watching movies or attending Gunter's Universe, a Talk show in VR every Tuesday evenings.
And it's just the early days...

There is a Sunday event at 6PM PST, 00H in France.
A great time to meet new people and visit and share worlds.

When I say that, it feels like the developers made an engine that could be used across multiple applications, and VR chat at this time is a demo for other people to take the engine and create a specific application. 

Or in another way, it feels like the second iteration of AltVR. 

Now it is free, and it is interesting to try out.. so on that it gets a YES on recommend. 
That all said, it feels unpolished in the graphics, and the activities don't really grab me. After under an hour, I hopped back into the bright and happy world of Rec Room.
