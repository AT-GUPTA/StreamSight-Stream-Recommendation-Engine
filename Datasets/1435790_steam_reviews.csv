Controls are a bit difficult to comprehend for people fresh to gaming such as my wife, but manageable.
Textures are very flat but that also makes it easier to understand what is in the room as it hard(er) to hide parts.
Music is nothing fantastic but not annoying. 
The only annoyance so far is that they did NOT explain certain KEY control elements. Such as how to pick up a part and make it so you can drag and drop other parts on it. ANd how to ""pin"" things so it does not zoop back into your inventory. They did have a ""Tutorial"" level. But these mechanics are not in the Tutorial and was critical to solve several puzzles.

PROS: 
+ Cooperative gameplay.
+ Cartoony graphics that're pleasing to the eye.
+ Lots of rooms made by developer (and more coming out for FREE!).
+ Rooms have different themes, ranging from Ancient Egyptian to Victorian mansions to futuristic space stations. 
+ Public and private gaming.
+ Male and female characters, where you can choose clothing, hair style, skin color, hair color, etc.
+ Workshop integration from the start (with a bunch of player-made rooms).
+ Developer-made rooms are generally small, which cuts down on motion sickness.
+ Options included in-game to deal with motion sickness.
+ Room editor is relatively simple to use and relies on a tile-based grid system.
+ Time limit is purely for achievements and you can completely ignore it if you wish.
+ Relatively low system requirements for a game released in 2021.
+ Will run on older operating systems like Windows 7 or Win 8/8.1, and is compatible with Mac OS and Linux.
+ Steam Cloud

NEUTRAL:
+/- Time limit might annoy some players who feel as if they need to complete the room before time is up, despite the time meaning nothing beyond achievements.
+/- Community-made rooms in the Workshop can vary greatly in quality (although this is through no fault of the developer).

CONS:
- Escape Simulator is only really fun when playing alongside at least one other person, which might make this game difficult to play if you have to rely on random players online. 
- Tokens are sometimes hidden in locations that are nearly impossible to see or get to, although the most recent developer-made rooms have been fixing that. 
- Game engine isn't designed (or at least optimized) for large rooms because some larger community-made rooms can cause a significant drop in framerate. 
- Very limited character customization, but at least character customization exists at all. In many Escape Room games you can't even make a character and instead you're essentially a ""floating head."" 
- While most of the graphics in the game are quite nice, there are some startling low textures on some (but not all!) carpets and other pieces of furniture.

VERDICT: Escape Simulator is a fun game to play alongside friends or family (my wife is my co-op partner), and is probably the best escape room game we've come across on Steam up to this point. The developers have done everything they can to mitigate motion sickness (which is a real problem for some people, my wife included) and make the game as user-friendly as possible while giving people tools to be creative. 

The only drawback I can really see to this game is that while you don't technically need other players (as specified earlier, you can play single player), Escape Simulator would feel empty or lifeless without other real people involved. So for gamers who don't have readily available co-op partners, grouping with randoms is really the only alternative and in my experience that's a real crapshoot. 

That said... if you have at least one co-op partner and you enjoy escape rooms (and puzzles in general), I'd strongly recommend Escape Simulator. It's a great non-combative, stress-free alternative to the vast majority of games out there.",1640729697,1708383110,True,180,0,0.914605200290679932,0,True,False,False

From the moment I entered the first room, I was hooked. The intricately designed puzzles, cleverly hidden clues, and unexpected twists kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire experience. Each room presented a unique set of challenges that required both logic and creativity to overcome, making every escape attempt a thrilling adventure.

What sets Escape Simulator apart is its attention to detail and immersive atmosphere. The environments are richly detailed, with interactive objects and subtle hints scattered throughout. The sound design further enhances the experience, adding tension and suspense as you race against the clock to solve each puzzle and unlock the next door.

But perhaps the most satisfying aspect of Escape Simulator is the sense of accomplishment that comes with each successful escape. The feeling of cracking a particularly tricky puzzle or uncovering a hidden passage is immensely gratifying, and it's what kept me coming back for more.

In conclusion, Escape Simulator is a must-play for fans of puzzle-solving and escape room experiences. It's a testament to the ingenuity of indie developers and the limitless potential of the genre. If you're looking for a game that will challenge your wits and keep you entertained for hours on end, look no further than Escape Simulator.

Pros: 
- Victorian themed rooms were fun and intuitive 
- A decent amount of content 

Cons: 
- Buggy asf. We didn't trophy a room because one of the puzzles required us to put ingredients in the fire in order, and the second ingredient floated in the fire instead of burning. We had to do it 3 times before it registered.
- Battery in a space room kept glitching in and out through the floor.
- Items dropped out of bounds usually respawn in the middle of the room, but some items can get stuck at an angle with an invisible wall (Egypt top of pyramid room). Had to keep throwing an object at it to try and knock it out of bounds so it could respawn. 
- The controls are clunky. 
- Can't share item inventory, and trying to read a page with a friend makes the item drop. 
- Big items in the room can't be thrown into the trash can and end up getting in the way. A LOT.",1708073799,1708073799,False,55,2,0.688796937465667725,0,True,False,False

The game actively encourages you to explore the rooms. That's great, because you're obviously not going to be finding everything you need by staying in one spot. Open drawers, sift through files, tinker with stuff. It's like any escape room, right?

Well...

The rooms themselves are VERY small. Sometimes you'll be vying for space with the remains of a broken urn, or maybe a chest lid that can't be removed from the room at all. While you can toss unneeded items and trash into the trash can in every room, it still doesn't  solve the issue of, say, three wood beams that somehow fell during the solving of a puzzle. That's not including the sheer number of bloat items in every level, designed to either get in your way, draw your attention away from a puzzle, or act as red herrings.

The game also has a number of optional goals that can be completed as you play. These come in the form of timed completion and tokens. Tokens are hidden in every room of the base game, eight per room. As far as I know, they don't do anything for you except contribute toward an achievement, but some of the tokens are either hidden in places you'll likely never look, or are IMPOSSIBLE to get if you finish the room. Timed completions net you a fancy trophy symbol on the level menu, as well as an achievement, but I personally find the presence of a timer stress-inducing. That being said, you can go back and replay levels as much as you want, so knowledge of the map will let you beat the clock if you're into that sort of thing.

Anyway, back to the game. The game doesn't take long to throw some incredibly vague environmental hints your way. For folks who like a challenge, this might not be that big of a deal, but when I say vague, I mean VAGUE. That's not even mentioning the sheer number of puzzles where the hints are almost non-existent. Even things that seem to be straightforward and very clearly correct are just...WRONG? 

Seriously, the game gaslights you into thinking you're stupid or doing something wrong. An obvious answer based on the hints you have just doesn't work, but through some mental gymnastics and mysticism you were SUPPOSED to arrive at THIS answer. I'm not sure who thought these puzzles were acceptable, but so many of the solutions to these puzzles are either convoluted or require knowledge that you DON'T have any access to at all ANYWHERE in the room. Two words: Chinese Takeout. If you played far enough, you'll know what that means. So many puzzles led to me dropping my Steam Deck onto my bed and pulling out my phone to look up the answer, which is NOT some thing you want players doing.

""But you could have just used the hints!"" someone might be saying. That's true, random netizen. The game does give a hint button, and there's no real disadvantage to hitting that sucker if you need the help. Which is nice, because I feel like some people will be HAMMERING that button just to get through some of the later rooms. But remember what I said about some of the game's hints: They're vague. And I mean VAGUE. I'm repeating that again, because some of the hints just didn't explain anything, while others just straight-up gave the answer. A good hint gives you a nudge in the right direction. It doesn't slap you and say ""You do this you idiot."" 

All that being said: SOME of the rooms were really well-designed, to the point of not needing the hints, AND to the point of actually being a lot of fun. The second themed area in the base game is an EXCELLENT example of good design. It was a great balance of challenging and fun, with a lot of moments where I would go ""Oh, that's clever!"", or had me laughing to myself and thinking ""You thought could fool ME?"". THAT is the stuff I live for. It also took me back to my time with The Room, which...gods, I miss that series. 

That set of rooms was the only one where I wasn't feeling as if the game was trying to make me feel stupid. Clever hiding places, clearly marked points of interest, well-designed environmental hints that you might gloss over at first until your brain goes ""Wait, turn back, what'd I see?""...If the game had consisted of rooms of that nature, I wouldn't be writing this. I'd be GUSHING about how much I love this game instead.

Of course, I'd be doing a disservice if I neglected to talk about the player-made rooms. Yes, you can make your own torture room for others to fail at, too, and, yes, some of the people who make them are absolutely insane. But, more importantly, some of the creators have nailed a great balance of challenge and fun. If the game's basic rooms are making you want to pull your hair out with how difficult they can be, give some of the workshop rooms a go. 

Tl;DR - Game is okay for those who really REALLY love escape rooms, but suffers from issues related mainly to puzzle difficulty and room size. Workshop levels are great, but the game is better picked up while on sale rather than at full price.",1703674379,1703674379,False,1,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

A fantastic puzzle game, particularly enjoyable with friends and it has some really nice, clever little puzzles in it. Escape Simulator definitely stands out among other escape games since each level is relatively short, so getting stuck doesn't halt your progress in the game as a whole - you can always go and do a different level and come back later.

First thing, this and Escape Academy have barely anything to do with each other: both are good games, but while Escape Academy relies on plot and story telling, Escape Simulator relies more on being an experience of thinking and puzzle solving.
And I must admit, each puzzle has a great ambiance, which provides a good background while solving them. 

If you're a fan of puzzle solving, go for it and its DLCs. It's a very good way to spend time solving puzzles without a story in between, when you feel like you just want to keep your mind occupied.

Done a fair amount of physical escape rooms and this game in my opinion is the only one that gets even close to what it feels like to do an escape room.

Well worth the $22 RRP but even better if its on sale. DLC is pretty good as well - what I find with the curator rooms is most of them don't have Hints (which for purists is what they want) but when you get stuck I kinda just want to keep going. 

Pine Studios are pretty good at releasing free rooms as well, at the time or writing there is a free Among Us Room which  I am excited to do.

The tokens make each room re-playable.  I've played solo and I've teamed up with the friend who introduced me to escape rooms.  Both ways are enjoyable and if I'm having trouble with a puzzle, teaming up is a surefire way to work through it.  I love that there are community designed rooms, though I haven't had a chance to play those yet.  Something to look forward to.  I liked the fact that I could demo the game to see if I liked it (and that co-op mode worked in the demo).  The demo was just enough of a taste that I was sold on it.

As for things that I don't like... I usually have to start the game, close it and restart it because it's always glitchy the first time it loads up.  That may be due to my PC, though.  We haven't had to use many hints, but when we did they were a mix of helpful and not really helpful at all (and the community rooms don't have them).

I don't play a lot of video games because they are hard on my hands, but this is one I can definitely play.  If you enjoy puzzles, mind games, and real-life escape rooms, you should definitely try out the free demo to see if this is something you'll enjoy.

My initial review (above) was afetr playing 12.3 hours.  I have now played an additional 191 hours.  I've played about 157 rooms, including all the Pine rooms as well as well over 100 community rooms, and I love them all.  There are amazing room builders in this community, designing excellent and intriguing rooms for us to play.  I did try building a room early on, but had some trouble and gave up.  I'd like to give it another try in the future.

The puzzles can be very challenging but still follow the golden rule of not needing any external knowledge. The key is about taking the time to observe the environment for the necessary clues or references.

The hardest part for me is finding all the tokens. Seriously, some of them are in the weirdest places and require more time to find than the challenge timer allows.

Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Have you ever wanted to escape from your mundane life, but the closest you've gotten is hiding in the bathroom with your phone? Well, fear not, because Escape Simulator is here to fulfil your wildest escape fantasies without the risk of your boss finding you curled up behind the office plant!

This game is the Houdini of virtual escapes. I felt like a genius solving puzzles, unlocking doors, and avoiding obstacles, all from the comfort of my sweatpants. It turns out, my superior intellect is only hindered by the lack of secret passages in my apartment.

The graphics are so realistic that I almost called my landlord to complain about the broken light in the game. Sorry, Gary, it's just pixels. And speaking of realism, the sound effects are so immersive that I had to check if my cat was meowing in the game or in real life. Note: It was both. Apparently, my cat is an escape artist too.

The best part is the character customization. I gave my virtual self a ninja costume, because nothing says ""stealthy escape"" like a ninja doing the moonwalk. Take that, surveillance cameras!

The only downside is that after playing this game, I tried to use a crowbar to open my front door. Now my neighbors think I'm auditioning for a superhero role. Thanks, Escape Simulator, for turning me into the neighborhood weirdo. At least I can escape judgment in the game.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a game that lets you escape reality without actually quitting your job or leaving your house, Escape Simulator is the key to your digital getaway. Just be prepared to explain to your friends why you're practicing lock-picking skills on your bedroom door.",1700743311,1700743311,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

By it's very nature, Escape Rooms don't really have any replay value, so it's exceptionally easy to burn through all the official maps quickly. The workshop maps made by the community are thankfully plentiful, though some are definitely better than others. The fact that the creators continue to release new updates even years after release definitely adds value too.

My two biggest dislikes with the game are the very basic, plastic-y rendering models (though that does make community creations much easier to craft and therefore more accessible), and the complete lack of save; you have to complete the entire room or start over from scratch; no pausing or stepping away in the middle of a room when something urgent comes up. (Timers in games are my arch-nemesis.)

I'm also not in love about the control scheme and the in-game object interactions; even after dozens of hours and many rooms, it's still counter-intuitive and I have to think about the buttons I'm pressing or where I'm clicking to get the result I want. It's also sometimes difficult to tell if you're just faffing about, or actually holding an object in the correct place to get a desired interaction.


So do I recommend the game? Yeah, yeah I do. The price tag (even without a sale) is low enough that buying copies for your friends to play with you won't break the bank, and the community workshop keeps the game fresh even after hours of playing. But it is by no means a perfect slam dunk, and there's absolutely room for UI improvement.",1699708985,1699708985,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The puzzles are extremely varied and plentiful both in theme and execution, and they've continued to add free content for some time alongside DLC. Plus the game isn't punishing; if you get stuck you always have the hint button (which seem to have no penalty).

I got about 11-12 hours out of the base game with the base and free added content combined (including the just-added portal content), which I think is well worth the price. There's also community created rooms, and it currently doesn't seem like there is much of a limit to what you can do on that end of things.

its super buggy in multiplayer and therefor esuper frustrating.  we played the egyptian rooms.

this game doesnt support Steam Family Sharing. i had to buy it 2 times to play it with my son  in the same physical room.

character Customization is spare

random occurings:
you cannot pickup things ( for example crucial keys )
you cannot drop things
things respawn in your invent
dropped items get auto picked up, although auto pickup is off
actions like brushing away dust were not available multiple times ( it lasted 3 minutes to find the right spot to activate it )
dropped items semetimes spawn at other locations.
objects are pickable through walls

bad design:
- you cannot keep a book open while you inspect/read foreign symbols/language
-  you cannot read through multiple scrolls in your inventory. they get grouped together and there is no way to read them separately.

Imagine the thrill of escape rooms, but in a digital realm. Escape Simulator by Pine Studio makes it a reality. With 16 themed escape rooms, it offers a delightful experience for you and your friends.

The game keeps it fresh with three themes for its rooms: ancient Egypt, spaceship adventures, and classic manor mysteries. Each theme brings unique twists to the puzzles, ensuring that no two rooms feel the same.

You navigate 3D rooms, similar to a point-and-click puzzler like The Room. It allows you to pick up, examine, and interact with items to uncover clues. However, be careful not to clutter the room, as a helpful bin allows you to store unwanted items. The game's art style, reminiscent of Planet Coaster, makes it clear which items are essential for solving puzzles. No more random clicking and hoping for the best.

Escape Simulator thrives when played with friends. You can team up with up to four players in each room. Much like real escape rooms, it's an excellent opportunity to bond or engage in friendly arguments over puzzle solutions. The game often offers multiple puzzles to work on simultaneously, so there's no downtime. Plus, you can see each other's cursors, enhancing collaboration.

After conquering all the rooms, the game provides collectibles and speedrunning as additional challenges. Tokens hidden within each room offer extra objectives. Completing rooms within a 15-minute time frame is another challenge, with rewards for successful speedruns.

One of Escape Simulator's standout features is its user-generated content. The game includes a robust content creation tool, allowing players to craft their own escape rooms. Shared via the Steam Workshop, this feature has the potential to extend the game's replayability indefinitely. With a growing library of custom user content, Escape Simulator offers endless possibilities for puzzle enthusiasts.

Get ready for an exciting puzzle adventure with friends in Escape Simulator!

TLDR:
 Escape Simulator is a well-made and immersive puzzle game that captures the essence of real-life escape rooms. With its emphasis on puzzles and cooperative gameplay, it offers a unique experience for players. 

The game's official levels are well-designed and visually appealing, with each environment having its own distinct theme. The inclusion of a hint system helps players when they get stuck, although there are instances where it could be more effective. The game's community-made levels provide endless content and creativity, allowing players to enjoy a wide variety of puzzles and challenges. 

The level editor is a powerful tool that opens up possibilities for players to create their own rooms and share them with others. While the game lacks midgame saving and VR support, its strengths in puzzle design and cooperative play make it a highly enjoyable experience. Whether playing solo or with friends, Escape Simulator is a must-play for puzzle enthusiasts and offers long-lasting entertainment.",1688928045,1697618851,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,True,False

I cannot recommend this game for two reasons though:

1) I bought this game for co-op, to have good time with my wife, and that was why I had to buy two copies of the game. But there's no co-op in this game actually. I mean you can play co-op, but all the puzzles are solvable if you're playing alone. Even worse: you can't solve puzzles together in this game. That's right, so your co-op will go like that: you stand in the opposite sides of the room and solve your own puzzle each. Or the one of you who is more skilled is running around the room and solving all the puzzles etc while another struggles to find anything to do. During the first 3 rooms of Egypt there was only one instance of working together: we had to pull 2 levers at the same time. Only once, that's it. If it changes a lot later, which I doubt, I will change my opinion.

2) There's no Russian translation of this game. Yes, 2nd (or 3rd, but still) most spoken language on the Internet is ignored by the developers. I cannot explain it other than it's a political statement. If so, then the developers better know that Russian is a language that Ukrainian people look for on Steam as well as Russians etc. The game turns 2 soon, it has Turkish, Italian (which I don't mind in the slightest)... requests from Russian-speaking community is ignored.

A great escape sim with a great variety of puzzles ranging from 10IQ to 200IQ. Best to play with friends, especially so after the new versus release, so you can now further assert dominance over your partner. The community puzzles are another great way to try out brilliant and gorgeously crafted puzzles by other beautiful minds.

The one major issue i have with the game is the inability to join games that are already running midway. Occasionally some people disconnect, or sometimes a wall glitch forces you to leave.

I have managed to solve some rooms, but this game will take me some time to finish. That's not a bad thing, but I suspect it might get frustrating at some point. I like that you can pick up so much stuff that has nothing to do with solving the room, so what you need to use isn't that obvious. Also, it's nice that all rooms are available at once without needing to solve the earlier ones first, so you won't get stuck, if you can't solve something right away.

Edit: I have now played all the main rooms and all but one of the extras. Some rooms were really tricky and I needed to find a walkthrough to figure out how some puzzles worked. Still, I've enjoyed this game so much that I decided to buy the DLCs as well.

While the developer's rooms are of the highest quality in terms of overall puzzle design and functionality, the shear amount of escape rooms available through Steam Workshop is insane.

Sure, there are lots of simple rooms that look like someone spent an hour on, but there are ones that really stand out that are DLC-worthy quality (in some rare cases, even better) and they're all free. Every week there's at least 4-5 new very enjoyable rooms made by a thriving community of room designers so the game always feels pretty fresh.

Developer is actively working on updates all the time and releasing new paid and free DLC so there's always something to look forward to. I remember the game took a little getting used to because your movement is a bit limited (for instance you can't jump) and the inventory/slotting really needs more polish (even still), and having watched my girlfriend play it I can tell there's a small learning curve with managing items.

If you like escape rooms and puzzle solving, this is the game to get (even at full price, which is a steal IMO). Other escape room games are at most 2-3 rooms and they're all over in an hour or two.

Pros:
1. Immersive Puzzles: Escape Simulator offers a diverse range of challenging puzzles that require both critical thinking and keen observation skills. The variety ensures that gameplay remains engaging throughout.
2. Realistic Environments: The game excels in creating realistic escape room environments, with attention to detail that enhances immersion. From dimly lit chambers to cluttered offices, each scenario feels authentic.
3. Smooth Controls: The intuitive controls make interacting with objects and solving puzzles a seamless experience. There's a natural flow to the gameplay, allowing players to focus on the challenges at hand.
4. Cooperative Gameplay: The option for multiplayer adds an exciting dynamic. Collaborating with friends or strangers adds an extra layer of complexity to the puzzles and encourages teamwork.
5. Regular Updates: The developers have shown a commitment to the game's longevity by consistently releasing new rooms and scenarios. This keeps the content fresh and provides ongoing challenges for players.

Cons:
1. Limited Story Integration: While the focus is on the puzzles, some players may feel a lack of a cohesive narrative. A stronger storyline could add depth to the overall experience.
2. Occasional Technical Hiccups: There were infrequent instances of minor glitches, such as objects not responding as expected. However, these were relatively rare and didn't significantly impact gameplay.
3. Learning Curve for New Players: Those unfamiliar with escape room mechanics might find the initial learning curve steep. A more comprehensive tutorial or optional hints could be beneficial for beginners.
4. Room Diversity: While the environments are well-crafted, a bit more variety in the types of rooms and scenarios would add further depth to the overall experience.

Overview:
Escape Simulator offers a captivating and challenging escape room experience. Its strengths lie in the intricate puzzles, realistic environments, and cooperative gameplay. While it could benefit from a stronger narrative element and occasional technical hiccups, these minor drawbacks are outweighed by the game's overall quality.

Gameplay:
The core gameplay revolves around solving a series of puzzles within a limited time frame to ""escape"" from a room or scenario. These puzzles range from classic lock-and-key combinations to more intricate riddles and logic challenges. The controls are intuitive, allowing for seamless interaction with objects. The inclusion of a multiplayer mode adds an exciting dimension, requiring effective communication and teamwork to succeed. Unique features like hidden compartments and interactive objects further enhance the gameplay experience.

Graphics and Sound:
Escape Simulator impresses with its detailed and immersive environments. From the subtle flicker of candlelight to the creaking of wooden floorboards, the game's sound design contributes significantly to the overall atmosphere. While not groundbreaking, the graphics are more than sufficient for the genre, focusing on creating realistic settings rather than pushing technical boundaries.

Story and Narrative:
The game's narrative takes a backseat to the puzzle-solving aspect. While there's a loose premise for each scenario, it serves primarily as a backdrop for the challenges at hand. A more robust and integrated storyline could elevate the overall experience, providing additional motivation for players to progress.

Performance and Technical Issues:
Escape Simulator runs smoothly for the most part, with load times being reasonable. While there were occasional minor technical hiccups, they were infrequent and didn't significantly hinder gameplay. The game demonstrates a level of polish that suggests a dedicated approach to addressing potential bugs.

Multiplayer and Community:
The multiplayer feature is a standout aspect of Escape Simulator. It promotes teamwork and cooperation, elevating the gameplay experience to a new level. The option to tackle puzzles with friends or engage with the community adds significant replay value.

Final Thoughts:
Escape Simulator delivers an engaging escape room experience that excels in its puzzles, realistic environments, and cooperative gameplay. Despite minor areas for improvement, such as narrative integration and occasional technical issues, the game's strengths far outweigh its drawbacks. For fans of the genre or anyone seeking a mentally stimulating challenge, Escape Simulator comes highly recommended.",1694286120,1694286120,True,3,0,0.520146489143371582,0,True,False,False

I still think the motion thing should be off by default.

Honestly it is not a bad game at all.
It's a casual puzzle game that provides hints and not too difficult. The logic behind the puzzles can be pretty dumb sometimes. Overall it is a decent casual, fun puzzle game. Then why do I have this downvoted you may ask, then let me tell you a story you lil sht. 

I've been playing FPS games like Siege and Apex for more than 20 years, fast paced, face action. I play them as if I am high on cocain or have rabies, people get sick watching me play because I play with very high sensitivities since I only have 2 to 3 inches of space for my mouse. I've never had issues playing like that for long sessions of gaming. This game on the other hand, the wonky a s s camera rotation and movement gave me motion sickness for the first time on PC in my life within 2 hours. That ruins the experience for me completely so I had to downvote it.",1666934892,1694145181,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Escape Simulator is similar to real-life escape rooms. You are typically given a theme and number of tasks and puzzles to complete in order to escape, these can vary in difficulty and style but ultimately follow the same formula in progression. Escape Simulator gives you a generous offering of pre-made ones by the team which definitely hit that conventional mark.

What makes this game miles ahead of the competition is the ability for players to make their own rooms, using the assets of the game but also their own assets as well. A fantastic combination which allows a extremely wonderful variety of puzzles which will be to everyone's liking. Whilst it may not have the polish you'd want to get immersed the creativity of the community really sells this and gives countless hours of fun.

[b]Puzzles[/b]
Brain. Hurts. But, to be honest, the puzzles are well-made and after completing the whole level, you'll feel like a freaking Einstein.
[b]Co-op[/b]
You need friends to play co-op. 0/10.
[b]Maps[/b]
There are around 25 maps in the base game, some in DLCs and a lot of community-made ones. I think it's enough even for puzzle-lovers.
[b]Conclusion[/b]
Escape Simulator is a really cool puzzle game with hours of content. If you can use your brain longer than 1 minute, you definitely should try it. But I'd recommend you to buy it, when it's on sale.

WHAT I LIKE:
- Nice art.
- Easy to understand mechanics.
- There are 27 escape rooms in total in the basic version, 4 more in each of the DLCs. You are looking at >10 hours of fun. - - Additionally, there are many community built rooms (and you can also build some yourself).
- The vast majority of puzzles are intuitive enough that you can figure them out without help. They are also clever and interesting, with different themes.
- Hints on how to proceed are provided if you do get stuck. 

WHAT I DISLIKE:
- Some, though thankfully only few, puzzles are too unintuitive and I would never have thought of the solution without using the hint. Like, there is absolutely no reason for me to think about breaking down a bar of soap to look for a pin inside.
- The tropheys. Each room has a time limit and if you can get out fast enough, you get a trophey. May seem like a good idea, but I find that it pushes me to use hints more than I would otherwise, to proceed faster and get the trophey first time. If you do not get it first time, you have to replay it (my completionist mind cannot NOT get the trophey if it's there). However, the rooms are not very replayable in short succession. Nothing is procedurally generated, every code is exactly the same, so replaying is a matter of a few minutes. Therefore, I don't really understand the point of the trophey. I would rather have a trophey for not using any hints, to motivate me to take my time and think.
- The tokens. Each room has 8 tokens hidden around it. Not really a bad idea, I like this type of thing, but not if it is nigh impossible to find. They are hidden too well. Despite consciously looking everywhere, I can rarely find more than 4 of them! It just gets frustrating. You have to be really stubborn and motivated to search for them all without resorting to guides. I wish the tokens were more conspicuous, bright coloured or sth. It would still be fairly hard to find them all, but not frustratingly so.",1690112330,1690112330,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It happened to be on sale at the time, so we decided to try it out. It ended up being super awesome, so we went back and purchased the DLC's as well. While this game can absolutely be enjoyed alone, I find it much more enjoyable to work together and solve puzzles together. We were super excited to see community rooms because the game is rather short and can be finished within a few days without the addition of the community rooms. The game is super interactive, from being able to break pots, push buttons and levers, move decor such as pillows etc. The base game puzzles are super fun and there are 8 levels per room and there are about 5 rooms. All of the community rooms are well put together and some are incredibly intricate and can take a few hours to solve.

I played this entirely solo and it was very enjoyable to figure out each part of the puzzles. Working with a team would be faster (typically) yet it would likely also be frustrating and hilarious at times. Plus for me, it's be like someone telling you where to move your cards in Solitaire (irritating most of the time)

BUT, the extra eyes/brains should help on the more difficult challenges. For my part, I  found myself sometimes being overly literal with a clue or getting stuck in a ""thinking loop""and would have benefited greatly from a different viewpoint. However the hints they provided were quite useful when I was completely stuck on a couple levels. 

Overall there's enough of a challenge in most of the rooms (especially as you get further along to put your brain to use for a good period of time. The physics are great and the ability to interact with almost everything is fun. (There's nothing quite like grinding to a halt in the saloon and throwing some bottles at the wall to alleviate the frustration!) 

I haven't found all the tokens (those things can be VERY well hidden) but I don't think I'm going to go back and grind for them. While it certainly would add more playtime with this title and a chance to carefully scour every single detail of each environment--and the environments are absolutely STUNNING!--it would likely be a pretty painful grind. Maybe in the future?

One of the main issues that I found plaguing Escape Simulator is the fiddliness of its controls and the overwhelming inventory system. While the controls themselves are responsive, the design choice to include an inventory where players can store every minuscule item becomes more of a hindrance than a helpful feature. It often leads to a situation where one player can monopolize the room, hoarding every object in sight and leaving others with limited opportunities to engage with the puzzles. This creates confusion and forces players to sift through each item individually, slowing down progress and impeding the overall enjoyment of the game.
The abundance of trivial objects in the inventory adds unnecessary complexity, distracting players from the core puzzles and challenges. Instead of focusing on the main objectives, players find themselves entangled in a web of insignificant items, making it harder to discern which objects are truly crucial to their escape. Streamlining the inventory system and reducing the number of trivial items would alleviate the confusion, enabling players to stay focused on the essential elements of the game.
While the intention behind the inventory system may have been to enhance immersion and provide a sense of realism, it ultimately disrupts the gameplay flow and hampers the cooperative aspect of the game. By limiting the inventory to key items or relevant clues, the game would foster better collaboration among players, allowing everyone to actively participate in the escape experience.
Considering the Shift to VR: Given the challenges posed by fiddly controls and the inventory overload, it's worth exploring how Escape Simulator might benefit from a transition to virtual reality (VR). In a VR environment, the physical interactions and intuitive gestures would offer a more seamless and immersive experience. Players could physically explore the room, manipulate objects with their hands, and interact with the environment more naturally. This would eliminate the need for an extensive inventory system, as players could directly interact with the objects in the virtual space. Such a shift would promote a more balanced and engaging gameplay experience, alleviating the frustrations caused by the current control and inventory design.
Conclusion: Escape Simulator presents an intriguing escape room adventure, but its fiddly controls and overwhelming inventory system hinder the overall enjoyment and cooperative dynamics of the game. The tendency for one player to hoard every item in the room causes confusion and slows down progress for others, distracting from the core puzzles. By streamlining the inventory and focusing on key items, the game would benefit from improved collaboration and clearer objectives. Additionally, considering a transition to virtual reality (VR) could offer a more immersive and intuitive gameplay experience, allowing players to interact with the environment directly. By addressing these concerns and exploring new avenues, Escape Simulator could elevate its appeal and provide a more enjoyable escape room adventure for all players involved.

First, let me clarify that I have only played Escape Simulator in Solo Mode. And that mode is extremely fun. You get to do what is necessary in any escape room. Explore, observe, deduct, combine, and solve enough puzzles to escape.
Most puzzles are solveable with time while others require some help. But luckily, help is always available by pressing a help button. And so far, I have not been unable to solve a room and the help provided was always good enough when I was stuck.
So, if you like escape rooms, this game is for you!

[b]However[/b], I suspect that the Co-Op Mode might not work as well. The rooms in the main game are simply too small, as has been pointed out by others. Then again, rooms in the DLCs and community rooms are bigger and might work in Co-Op Mode.

- It's been mentioned in other reviews, but you cannot save in the middle of a room. If you have to leave the game without completing the room you'll have to start it over (though your collectibles will remain found).

I didn‚Äôt try this in single player, I bought this game to play in two player co-op, based on the store page description ""[i]best with 2-3 players, but playable with more[/i]"" as the main reason.

[hr][/hr] 
[h2]I like puzzle games, I like co-op games and I really like co-op puzzle games, but unfortunately Escape Simulator fails in that department.[/h2]


For comparison, we can take a look at ‚ÄòWe Were Here‚Äô as an example for a game that does co-op well.
‚ÄòWe Were Here‚Äô is designed for two players in mind, putting each player in a completely different environment, giving them different tools and providing each of them with only half of the solution to the puzzle, forcing them to communicate and cooperate in order to win.


In contrast, Escape Simulator seems to be designed for a single player with only minimal changes when playing in co-op;
Each map is very small, claustrophobic and filled with many interact-able objects which you can pick up, and since each player can pick up things and store them in their inventory or throw them around (some of which can even break into many smaller pieces) it creates chaos and confusion as each player is looking at a different direction and is unaware of the actions of the other.

[hr][/hr] 

[h2]When both players are in the same room it means you really only need one player to actually solve the puzzle and the other player is just in the way by blocking the view or interacting with objects.[/h2]


The only difference between solo and co-op is that some puzzles change slightly to force two players to interact with them simultaneously.
For example in one of the rooms you need to adjust the position of 2 levers, when in single player you can just freely move them but when playing co-op the levers don‚Äôt hold their position so both players have to hold them.


That‚Äôs it, that's all that makes this a ‚Äúco-op game, best with 2-3 players‚Äù.


The game ends up being worse in co-op than just having one player stream it to the other while playing solo, because what‚Äôs the point of having two or more (I can‚Äôt even imagine what a nightmare this would be with more) players if they are both looking and interacting with the same stuff anyway.


I do wanna note some features that I did like, although most of them just make the game better for solo play:
[list]
[*]The way you can pick up and throw items feels pretty nice.
[*]You can inspect and pin items to your screen (useful for notes etc.) and then move them around (though you can‚Äôt resize them, and some have bad textures making it hard to read as it is).
[*]When a player is inspecting an item other players can join in and inspect it with them, with the caveat that while they can interact with things like buttons and dials, only the person holding the item can rotate and if he stops inspecting the other player gets booted out of it.
[*]Also worth noting about the above points, when inspecting, the game seems to take a snapshot of the screen and blur the background so you can‚Äôt actually see what‚Äôs happening in front of you (this caused some annoying situations and miscommunications until we figured that out). And more importantly, some items can‚Äôt be viewed properly when ‚Äúguest inspecting‚Äù, when my friend inspected a remote control camera it worked fine for him but when I tried to watch what he was doing I just saw the camera rotating infinitely (which again caused some confusion) and I have no idea how that‚Äôs acceptable for the developers in a multiplayer game.
[/list]


I think this game might be decent enough solo, but if you‚Äôre looking for a good co-op experience you should keep looking.",1688414077,1688414641,False,13,0,0.487680345773696899,0,True,False,False

Likewise, it would be useful if the workshop levels displayed the average (outliers excluded) time players took to complete the level - not so much for trying to beat that time, but more to give you an idea of what you're getting into before you start considering the lack of consistency in the length of workshop levels.",1688278595,1688278595,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

The core levels form a nice collection of 3d room-escape mini-games, most of which belong in one of a few themed series. The music and graphics are excellent, and the puzzles are very good as I recall. New free levels are added from time to time (there are also a couple of DLCs you can buy, but I don't have those so I'm only reviewing the main game). In case you're ever stuck in the standard levels, on YouTube there are walkthroughs for everything (including collectibles and achievements).

However, Escape Simulator's greatest strength is in the community. You can play with your friends, you can make your own levels with the level editor and share them with the world, and you can play other people's levels. There are scores of player-made levels, along with curated monthly and yearly collections thereof (and also frequent level-creation competitions). This is what will keep you coming back to the game. You can even find walkthroughs for some popular player-made levels.

The control scheme combines keyboard and mouse controls (touchpad is not recommended), and it's a little clunky at times. It's possible (though uncommon) for an item to disappear behind a wall, but I've found that this isn't a big deal. What really needs some work in my opinion is the multiplayer setup; if you lose connection for even a moment, you can't rejoin the group, and this does spoil the fun when it happens.

Despite the aforementioned problems, this is an overall fun game to enjoy with friends, and I'm glad I bought it. If you like room-escape games, I think you too will become a fan.",1687876798,1687876798,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only complaint I might have is that the coop could perhaps be better? As it is, you could easily solve each room solo, and the coop mode does not seem to add any coop element to it other than simply 2 people solving it at the same time. It might be fun to have certain rooms that require the cooperation of 2 or more individuals to solve. Does not take away from the immersive-ness but would be a great addition to have.

This simulator game is perfect for anyone who loves the idea of breaking out of prison without actually having to go to jail.

The graphics in Escape Simulator are‚Ä¶ well, let's just say they're not going to win any awards. The prison looks like it was designed by a 5-year-old with a crayon, and the guards are about as intelligent as a loaf of bread. But hey, who needs fancy graphics when you're plotting your escape?

One of the best things about Escape Simulator is the variety of escape routes you can take. From crawling through air vents to digging tunnels with spoons, there's a prison break method for every occasion. And let's be honest, who doesn't love a good heist movie?

Another great feature of Escape Simulator is the ability to customize your character. You can choose your inmate's hairstyle, clothing, and even their tattoo. Just be careful not to make them too memorable, or the guards might catch on to your plan.

Of course, no game is perfect. Escape Simulator does have its fair share of quirks and annoyances. Sometimes the guards will spot you even if you're hiding behind a lamp, or your character will glitch through the wall and get stuck in the ceiling. But hey, that just adds to the challenge, right?

I immediately noticed the inventory UX is fighting against me. Clicking both mouse buttons and spacebar to do stuff that could be done with one button. I may need to learn more shortcuts if they exist, but I can't deal with 3 buttons to do the same kind of stuff. 

Changing video settings didn't apply. I found no apply button. Found no evidence my video settings changed. No feedback from the program when I changed settings.

It's easier to put items in bins than it is to take them out. (1 click = bin, 2 clicks + a right click = back in inventory)

Scrollwheel up doesn't select items at first, you have to scroll down first. 

The question mark button on the wall should be nixed and a question mark or a camera in your inventory would be better. The wall button breaks the immersion of being stuck somewhere. It also too-closely resembles a Mario Block question mark. Looking at it on the wall, I feel like I'm on a game show. 

Investigating items is a pain. Unlike THE ROOM, there's no contextual hints when clicking on something incorrectly. Stuff like ""There's no water in the canteen, but I can see something inside..."" would be great. I spent a minute trying to angle the canteen so the coin would line-up, but the camera angle was fixed so I couldn't look top-down into it. 

LOTS of extra crap in the room to pickup. They put a garbage bin in the room so you can organize, which IMHO is a problem failing to solve another problem. Escape rooms should only have less distracting items.

Maybe an option to give more time to solo adventurers. 

The very first room has a book you need to reference to solve a puzzle. Standard escape room stuff. The background symbols you are referencing blurs out, and the book covers your entire face. Leaving you some choices. Run down the timer and compare, don't play solo, or break the immersion and screenshot it. I don't want to do any of those things to solve a puzzle. I noticed the Timer was running down as I looked back and forth from the book 10+ times and I said screw it, I'm writing a review because the UX of the solo play is not up to my standard. 

Room look and quantity are spoiled for you when you look at the main menu. Think of older games where they would only show you the levels you made it to? The menu sorely needs that. Give users something they want to work towards instead of showing them everything they can possibly do. This way it feels more like a game and less of a sandbox.  

I'll go back and try again, and I'll eagerly await updates, but as a HUGE fan of point and clicks, escape rooms, I see this game being better, and my first impression wasn't anywhere near the smooth as the UX from THE ROOM. 

Still marking as recommended because there's nothing else like it and it has huge potential.",1682597807,1682598157,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

Aside from that, the clues and puzzles were what one would expect from a well designed escape room and even has a hint system that quickly gets you back on track. Visuals are pretty eye-catching too.

Occasionally this can get frustrating as rather than trying to problem solve you are just wondering around looking for stuff to do. The better designed levels avoid this problem and generally makes the whole experience more fun and less frustrating. The game itself is very simple, so get some friends together and start gathering items. 

I generally don't recommend the player created rooms, while it adds a lot of content they tend to be buggy and generally less interactive which kills the experience for me.

To be completely transparent, I bought this game on sale when it was a few dollars off about a month back, but it allowed me to purchase all of the discounted DLC as well, but even at full price, you really do get a lot for your money - even without the added DLC.  

I frequent escape rooms  in the real world.  I've never done any virtual escape rooms so I'm not exactly sure how this game would compare to an experience like that, but I've thoroughly enjoyed stimulating my brain and taking a break from the mainstream types of games like shooters and RPG's with this gem.  I initially exhausted all of the free to play options for escape room games on steam, and some were decent whereas others weren't that great, but as to be expected especially considering the price (none).

I can honestly say that when it came time to spending money on an escape game, there are a few that stood out to me and that I still have on my wishlist to eventually pick up, but Escape Simulator seemed to have the most going for it in that the BASE game has over 20 different escape rooms across 4 entirely different themes - each with their own aesthetic and puzzle types - not to mention the versatility of community rooms and an editor that you can use to create your own.  The fact that the team at Pine Studios consistently curates their top picks for the previous month makes everything feel new and will keep me coming back even after fully completing this game.  They also have been known to add free DLC rooms, like their newest: Leonardo's Workshop, which is a room full of many puzzles and gives you upwards of an hour to escape versus the standard 15 minutes.

The Steampunk & Wild West DLC, especially if you can get on sale, would come highly recommended by me as well.  Each consists of four separate rooms, again, fitting the overall ""chapter"" or ""series"" of rooms, but completely unique from eachother.  These rooms also have an escape time of 45 minutes, meaning more puzzles and more fun to work your way through - worth every penny! 

I didn't find many of the puzzles to be overly complicated throughout my play, although they weren't particularly easy either.  I found there to be a great mix of general logic puzzles as well as your standard lock/key/combinations, which typically I'm more a fan of the latter.  It feels very rewarding to complete a room and finish it with seconds or minutes to spare to secure the trophy over the participation ribbon!

Another great feature that I found works seamlessly, aside from a few laggy connection issues, is the ability to play co-op as easily as you can play solo.  Playing co-op with your friends, or even finding some in the active community on Steam or Pine Studio's Discord, presents a different element and sometimes a completely different challenge in itself.  Communication is key, and I definitely found solo play easier since YOU'RE the one with access to all of the clues and information.  There is so much to pick up and inspect in each of these rooms, and not all of the ""props"" have a purpose so things can get cluttered at times - especially factoring in the ability to break different items around the room.  It was a very good idea for them to add a garbage can to let you clean up as you go and keep things simple and organized.

The inventory system is great, too.  Although it's unlimited and in theory, you could hold on to everything you find in the room, I found that once you're at over 9 items, the hot keys become a real pain to use and the controls suddenly feel very clunky.

The tokens, although a fun little tidbit as seemingly every game needs to have some sort of collectable these days, don't do anything.  One of my only negatives for this game would be that there should be some incentive to collecting these aside from the achievement at the end.  Don't get me wrong, I did it, but I didn't enjoy it.  It would be cool if maybe it unlocked some unique appearance options since they spent at least a little time with allowing you to customise your character.

Again, all-in-all, TL;DR:  If you're into escape room games in real life and haven't tried any video games of this style, you can't go wrong with this one.  If, like me, you started with trying some free escape room games, I can't recommend Escape Simulator high enough as the first one to spend money on as the few naggy negatives I have about this game really don't pertain to the core of what it is at all.  You won't be disappointed, especially if you like these types of games!

As a final note, and partially why I was able to spend nearly 50 hours on this game is because I enjoyed it so much, I put together some short guides on how to solve some of the most complex puzzles in each of the rooms - as well as full room walkthroughs for each of the rooms available currently, with the exception of community rooms.

Although it can be done solo, I think it is primarily a co-op game as doing it with friends is great. I recommend only 2-3 play together though, we tried it with 5 and although it worked we tended to get lost as others would solve puzzles before some even got to see them.

The game gives you some basic tools - look around, pick something up, move something, etc. and dumps you into a room filled with puzzles - if you have ever done an escape room or wanted to, give this a try as it simulates the kind of things in them pretty well.  There are a couple of issues with the engine - default movement tends to make me nauseous (there are some montio-sickness options which help) and sometimes things that are dropped go through the floor and are lost..but by and large it runs without problem on my computer.

The puzzles can be tricky - counting the footprints in the room gives the code to unlock the door, or finding a well hidden number in a painting on the wall, etc. But by and large they are sensible and fun. Plus everyone has hints or a walkthrough available if you get stumped.

What really shines is the Workshop. Dozens/hundreds of homemade escape rooms being created by devious minds and programmed into the game. It means it will never get boring for as long as you want to play it.

I recommend getting someone you know who is reluctant to play games (boyfriend/girlfriend/mom/etc.) to give it a try, it can really hook people who don't care for traditional games, and as a bonus if they are interested in game creation, there is the workshop which gives you all the tools you need to make your own and share them with the world.",1681099113,1681099113,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me start by saying that this game is the perfect mix of hilarious and challenging. It's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while being chased by a pack of wild dogs. But instead of dogs, you're being chased by crazy obstacles and traps that make you laugh and scream at the same time.

Moe, Julian, and I were so immersed in the game that we forgot we were just sitting in front of our computers. We were yelling and cheering as if we were actually trying to escape from a prison or a haunted house. And trust me, it's not easy to solve puzzles and escape rooms while being drunk, but we managed to do it somehow.

The best part of the game was the hilarious voiceovers and dialogue that kept us laughing throughout. We couldn't stop quoting lines like ""I'm too pretty to die"" or ""I'm too dumb for this"" for days after we played. And let's not forget about the random fart noises that had us rolling on the floor.

Overall, Escape Simulator is the perfect game for a night of drunken shenanigans with your friends. It's challenging enough to keep you engaged, but funny enough to keep you laughing until your stomach hurts. So, if you're looking for a game that will make you forget your problems and have a great time, Escape Simulator is the way to go!",1680094457,1680094457,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think the strongest sides of the game are the creative rooms, especially the newer ones and the excellent multiplayer which just works without issues.

1. I love escape rooms and the base content is really fun to play with the themed rooms and a mostly realistic escape room experience  
2. The puzzle can vary from pretty difficult to fairly simple but all of them work like a real escape room would which is 'the answer is usually very obvious and within your grasp, it will not be attached under a chair or under the carpet'
3. Playing with my friend has felt good and made it worthwhile to keep coming back, I feel for the room sizes having four people feels a little crowded (the newer content fixes this problem)
4. All the updates and DLC have been awesome and worth playing, I really appriciate having a reason to come back and keep playing 
5. Having the ability to make your own escape room and play other peoples escape rooms is really cool for a feature, it lets people live our there escape room dreams and play themed escape rooms that are fun each time (I do wish there was a mod or something like this that tested the room for bugs or impossible puzzles because about 70% of them have one of these that make it so I have to stop playing the community room)
6. If the devs ever think about doing a collab with another game series or movie people or tv series, I would be honored to play it because that would be really cool to have something like Final Fantasy Midgard Themed Escape (that would be really cool)
7. I dont know if this is in the community rooms but if you have a import my model/sprites in feature thats cool since then people can be more creative about making a room to show to others 

That is all, thanks for making me love Escape Rooms more than I already did, it made me want to try to IRL Escape Rooms if I get the chance to

The puzzles are each bite-size enough to play one or two in a sitting without requiring a huge time commitment. It can be done alone, which would probably be quite tough to do (within the time limit), but it is a blast to play with friends in online co-op.

They're really small, and any more than two people would feel suffocating to me. So if you're thinking of getting this to play with your crew, rather than with your BFF or partner... maybe consider something else.

That said, it's exactly what it says on the label. You have a bunch of rooms to escape, grouped by different themes. The rooms that come with the game have your typical moon logic where you need to use your intuition, hunches, and the knowledge that every puzzle has a solution that can be physically found in the area. Classic.

I personally found the difficulty fun and just right, but my ""friend"" found herself frustrated in the latter stages. She still solved her fair share of puzzles, mind; and when things get too tough, there's a helpful hint button that often points you towards that one thing you're missing - usually without straight out giving you the answer.

We beat all the pre-packaged rooms but didn't touch the community ones - and it seems like that's where the meat is. Who knows, maybe we'll check them out at some point, but in the end we aren't that much into escape rooms. Still, it was a pleasant experience for what it was.

If you like escape rooms, you're definitely going to like Escape Simulator. The only criticism I can think of is that the character customisation options are somewhat lacking, and the victory dances are incredibly awkward - especially clapping, I'm not even sure if that's supposed to be clapping... but hey, you're here to escape rooms, not to watch your characters do silly poses, right?

Started off playing with my wife and we both had a blast once we figured out the mechanics of the game. It's simple enough, but very satisfying. We didn't beat the timer on the first few levels, but once we got the hang of it, we managed to clear a lot of levels within the timeframe. It's nice to not get kicked out of the room when the timer is done, like you do sometimes in real escape rooms. We didn't use any hints and just let the timer run out if we needed to. Having the tokens to find in the rooms was a nice touch as well.

I typically play with a higher FOV than default in most games, so I adjusted my FOV accordingly. I recommend not doing this, as it looks quite weird. The 3D nature of the game is already not the best, so you don't want to mess with it. It's forgivable for what the game is.

The game has a large community fan-base which designs levels that you can play. Many are quite good, and some are very hard. I also made a few levels for my wife as gifts and it was awesome to see her enjoy something I crafted just for her! The toolkit for design is quite powerful, and you can do a lot with it. I look forward to future developments to this portion of the game.

This game is probably fun on it's own, but I'd imagine it's more fun with at least one other person. I'd highly recommend it at full price; it's honestly worth more. If it's on sale, it's a no-brainer. I typically don't review games until I'm done with them, but this game continues to offer DLC for purchase, so I decided I needed to go ahead and just review it. I'm also really happy that they've released a few free rooms since launch. It's nice to see a dev support a game with both free and paid content as time goes on, and when there isn't any, the community rooms are great.

The game itself has slightly clunky mechanics; its not really frustrating and often lends itself to some funny moments when you accidentally smash a vase, or throw a painting across the room. The puzzles have been varied, interesting with some great 'Ah hah!' moments and have been challenging. 

The time limit is a little stressful, but there's no particular consequence if you go over on time. I know Escape Rooms have this added challenge IRL, but I do like figuring out puzzles at my own pace!

There are also more free rooms in development, which i am looking forward to playing once they come out. One thing i will say is that it does stick pretty hard to the escape room formula, in that the end goal of every room is the exact same: to open a door to escape. Considering the freedoms afforded by this being a video game, I think there could be some more variety in what the goal is (stealing a gem, pressing a button before the room explodes, etc...), but its a pretty minor gripe.

Escape games also have been around and were created around the same time as the Escape Room idea, so Escape Simulator isn‚Äôt a new idea, however, it‚Äôs an attempt to get on that same craze.

Escape Simulator has the player choose an Escape Room from a list of 25 levels, included within are four sets of five levels in a themed chapter, but each room can be approached in any order. From there, players are given fifteen or more minutes to solve all the puzzles in the room and escape them. 

After fifteen minutes though, luckily the game doesn‚Äôt stop but lets players escape however long it takes.  The fifteen minutes is the time to be awarded a ‚ÄúTrophy‚Äù for a set of achievements, conceptually an interesting idea, but having a major flaw in that after a player solves a single room, they can usually re-run that escape in a fraction of the time, since most of the puzzles have been solved.

That‚Äôs ultimately the biggest issue that Escape Simulator runs into, escape rooms or Escape games only work a single time.  The experience has to be magical for the players because after the puzzles are solved and players leave the room, there‚Äôs no reason to return.  The good news with Escape Simulator is there‚Äôs the ability for fans to upload their levels, but ultimately players will be at the mercy of the other designers. 

As for the core levels of Escape Simulator, every level feels both unique and interesting, and I spent at least 5 hours enjoying the game.  When a level is tuned just right, the experience feels amazing, but there are at least two or three puzzles that I‚Äôm not sure how to solve. 

Inside the game, there‚Äôs the ability to press a button and get a ‚Äúhint‚Äù with that button then give a new hint after each press.  This is the best way to handle these puzzles so players don‚Äôt get spoiled by guides, however, those two or three puzzles I mentioned were ones where after all the hints were given I still have no clue the direction the game wanted me to go without the external guides' assistance.  

That‚Äôs always going to be a problem and with each puzzle only having one path to the solution, if a player misses a logical leap it leaves them needing to go to a guide to get the solution, and Escape Simulator does have a decent number of those leaps at times.

Similarly, there are 8 hidden tokens to find per level, which only grants an additional achievement per set of levels.  Many of these are well hidden and will be things people will notice as they play through a level, but again this is something a guide is going to be useful for unless players want to examine every texture and location in a game.  

In addition, there‚Äôs also a co-op mode, which makes sense as Escape Rooms are intended to be played by multiple people, but I feel like co-op would weaken the experience here because, for each player, there‚Äôs a 50 percent chance of solving a specific puzzle, a second person might help for when players get stuck, but for the most part, the desire would be to increase the experience for the player, not skip half of it while working with another person.  For a large escape room, more players are necessary because there‚Äôs too much to do, but Escape Simulator never reaches that scale or necessity.

If you‚Äôre a fan of puzzles, Escape Simulator is a good time.  There‚Äôs a lot of variety in the puzzles and well-designed locations, but after finishing the game, I have an issue, there‚Äôs only a handful of puzzles that stood out, and I believe that‚Äôs because there are limited tools for designing the level.  

Last year I played Escape Academy which is a story-based game focused on Escape Rules.  Academy had only 13 levels, half the number in Escape Simulator, but when looking at both games, Escape Simulator didn‚Äôt stand out as much.  Escape Academy was a more impressive game, due to its variety and how every level stood out as a unique experience.  Many of those rooms were unique in that a real escape room wouldn‚Äôt be able to do the same things in the real world.  In Escape Simulator, every room feels like players are once again in a room of the same size and shape, and while the puzzles are unique, the grandiose feeling of solving a once-in-a-lifetime escape room is missing, and that‚Äôs really what Escape Simulator could have provided.  The feeling of solving an escape room that would be impossible to do in real life.

The playtime is overall quite long, with different themes, each offering a variety of rooms, which is good for a game of this price range. Added to that, a very good point are the community rooms, which add a lot of replayability to this game and even more fun puzzles.

Playing through the worlds surely takes some time but the puzzles were completely trivial and forgettable to me. Maybe it's the level editor aspect that is bottlenecking the mechanics to this generic feel.

The human characters feel like wasted effort to me, they're just plastic and emotionless and don't achieve anything. Again, maybe in multiplayer experience they matter.

There's no story and the puzzle worlds just exist in a vacuum. There are many good puzzle games with compelling story arcs and sense of accomplishment, and this game is falling short. The Last Campfire, The Witness, The Room series, Manifold Garden... all of these are vastly, vastly more compelling single-player experiences.",1674385131,1674385131,False,4,0,0.534208774566650391,2,True,False,False

There are a lot of rooms near us and in less than a 1-hour drive but it's tough to synchronize our schedules to find more than 1 slot a month to play. We needed a faster, easier method to play some cooperative puzzles and that's how we found Escape Simulator!

It's a bit different feeling than analog rooms but it's close enough. Puzzles are diverse - based on locks, ciphers, puzzle boxes, etc. as well as electronic devices, physical/chemical/biological experiments, and old-school items breaking with a hammer. Rooms made by devs follow certain schema but it's not repetitive nor boring - you learn new tricks in almost every scenario. In general, we enjoy this game, and are coming back to it now and then to calm down the urge to go to a real-life Escape Room when we can't find enough free time or money :D

[u]PROS:[/u]
- pretty - this game looks really lovely. Cartoon graphics makes everything very readable and sharp so it's pretty hard to not notice important puzzles
- very creative puzzles - even though there are a lot of locks in almost all dev rooms you don't get bored with them because it's always a different way to get the combination. Secrets are in general nicely hidden sometimes even in plain sight, you don't get too much headache over them but get that nice rush of satisfaction after figuring them out.
- good implementation of clues - I wouldn't say rooms are linear. Multiple puzzles are available from the start and I don't think we had to start with a particular one even once. What we found more challenging was to divide them between ourselves. This is also not your typical Point'n'Click game when you have to combine items 'till they work. Most clues are simple but specific, you can easily figure out where to use them. Some clues are maybe too guiding but for good reason (why would anyone write a vague book?). When you are stuck you can always use a hint button and those clues are very nicely done (we used them maybe 3 times across all rooms available in the base game and both DLCs).
- cool design - rooms have themes and they are designed very well. Music fits nicely, sounds are immersive, and items scattered around are just enough distracting.
- workshop support - community rooms vary in quality but the best ones made our jaws drop. It's marvelous what people can make with the in-game level editor and we are actively waiting for the next rooms of our favorite creators. 
- controls - those are fine. You can pin items to your view, wear certain objects, and take a look at what your buddy is doing. The only thing that bugged me a little was the unintuitive way of picking up items but I got used to it.

[u]CONS:[/u]
- some bugs - it's not bad but some stuff happened. Once the script didn't start at all  - we still could finish the room by brute force (but we didn't) but we couldn't access certain mechanics and clues. In the other room, one puzzle glitched and was unsolvable. For both cases, the game restart helped. I think if you are not trying to fight with this game the chance of getting bugs or glitches is low.
- no VR support - this game would be so good in VR. I get that it's probably way too hard to implement it satisfyingly but still - I wish I could play it with goggles.
- the number of people playing matters a lot - the first couple of rooms didn't have enough puzzles to share between 4 people and we still had this issue from time to time later on. Sometimes 4 people trying to solve 4 puzzles generate too much chaos, other times 4 people are working on a single puzzle and struggle to communicate effectively. We played token hunting when someone didn't have any input. Some rooms are almost claustrophobic when played as 4 player team. 

In general - worth the price, worth the time, worth the fun :)",1672653989,1672656994,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game *really* feels like true escape rooms~. Only downside so far as I've seen, is that you don't get to complete one room to be able to go into another room that you also have to solve to then eventually escape. It is literally just 'one room' all the puzzles are in. BUT, some rooms actually let you interact from afar outside the room you are in- like an Egyptian level with vast land around you- that makes it feel more expansive and interactive beyond the bounding room.

Puzzle will get hard. Only in level 3 or 4 of the Space themed ones did my mom and I end up getting stuck in for maybe an *hour*. It actually dealt with 'science'- molecules to be specific. I felt like I should have paid more attention in school because of that level lol. We were sooo stumped; and we were determined to never use hints. We didn't use hints still no, and eventually she figured out, but I would have never solved it myself.

On that note: Def more fun and better with a person or two, even if it's a touch chaotic cause the room is really small/compact/clastrophobic.

Added Pro: Other people can make rooms and share them, like a level maker. Like some other games, people can make their own rooms and post to public for them to play.

 - This means aside from the 'main story' ones (not really stories), there is still many more rooms you can try and play because of community~. So you aren't just paying for one game that you play once and never come back to- because the rooms do not randomize the puzzles. I have confidence there are some good community ones~. There are smart people out there!

Cons: Some controls make me confused and get finger twistered. Some buttons do the same thing as another button, so you might accidentally hit that button or a dif one and does something you didn't want to be done making items appear on screen, then drop, or go to bag, and lkasjdf.
Some Puzzles are easy to complete with 'trial and error' tries, that would mean not needing an object that would have solved it: BUT, most the puzzles still have alot to do and solve that are harder in the same level~.",1672089150,1672089150,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The most important part of such game is that community support, developers chose to give players the tools to create maps themselves and it really extends the life of the game. I hope to see many skilled players creating more wonderful puzzles.

Interactive environment was quite interesting for me since I loved destroying stuff and putting them into trash.

Also there are some severe issues in multiplayer that are not prevalent in single player. The game is decent for single player but for multiplayer (especially user created content which is the majority of reason to play) it's lacking. :(

Update: I still play this game and the content that's been added and capabilities are very nice. It still has some multiplayer issues though so my original review still stands. Hopefully they can fix it in time though.

This game is 100% worth your attention. The rooms included in the game fun, well thought out, and challenging. Some puzzles have me stumped, then the glorious ""aha moment"" hits and you actually feel engaged. The workshop rooms can be amazing and the community has made some spectacular puzzles. The game has a built in ""daily puzzles"" that serve up the best puzzles from the workshop. And if you feel genuinely stuck, then the built in clues give a hint without giving away the whole puzzle, which is a difficult thing to find.

The art style is very simple, kinda cutesy, but it means that you aren't bombarded by detail not necessary to the core gameplay loop.

If you enjoy working the brain a bit more than what AAA games (like the Tomb Raider reboots or God of War 4) seem to think you're capable off, then I highly recommend this one.

P.S. If you like this, you should also check out The Room franchise, longer puzzles with a darker undertone.",1660151605,1670488443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On one hand, it can be a fun, challenging, brain tickler that brings people together in an attempt to beat a wonderfully crafted collection of various themed puzzle rooms, bringing you and your partner or group of friends (max 3), across the ruins of ancient Egypt to a dishevelled mess of a space ship thousands of years into the future. It allows everyone to put their collective brain cells together, with everyone having their own euphoric ""EUREKA!"" moment, as your group applauds the person that cracked that one code, or found that certain message hidden in plain sight. 

On the other, however, thanks to its physics engine, it could also be a game where you and your group run around like headless chickens. Each one of you channeling your inner goblin brain by smashing, breaking, and turning over anything and everything until you stumble across the solution to a puzzle no one had a clue was even a puzzle in the first place, before a satisfying chime sounds and is followed up with a notification saying ""X solved a puzzle"" that appears in the lower corner of your screen. The group of idiots that you love hanging out with so much will live up to that name when each and every one of you fails to see the solution to a puzzle that, in hindsight wasn't much of a thinker, to begin with, but leaves you all collectively slapping your foreheads. Simultaneously and equally dumbfounded that no one thought about doing that one thing sooner. It's fine though, just say that you're ""tired"". I'm sure that excuse will work after the one-hundredth time... right?

However you play it and whoever you play it with, it is safe to say that you will have a blast going through the collection of lovingly detailed levels if you enjoy testing that ol' noggin of yours. Best yet, it isn't graphically intensive whatsoever so many people can have the ability to just boot it up and play with little to no hassle. If you're done with everything the game has to throw at you, why not download some of the community levels to keep the fun going?

Let me tell you, we had a blast! We played for almost 8 hours straight through the main game. The next day I bought the Steampunk DLC and we played through the entirety of that in one sitting. Some other friends joined into helping out with the puzzles and we all had a great time!

The puzzles are clever, but not frustrating. Some of the more challenging ones gave us a real sense of accomplishment once we figured them out. We rarely beat the rooms within the time limit, but that is also because we took our time looking around the beautiful rooms and having fun with the many details hidden inside them.

The controls are easy to grasp and you can adjust the key bindings to your own liking.

It's a very charming game, from the little details that came back in multiple rooms to the victory dancing at the end. Overall, would definitely recommend to anyone who likes a good puzzle game.

What might look like a brief experience on the surface as with many digital escape rooms, turned out to be one of the [u] most unique long term investments [/u] into ""game night with friends""!
This game has been out for about a year and the lovely community as well as the creators of Escape Simulator have been constantly adding new content to the game! May it be through the vastly expanding creative Community Rooms, Free Expansions, Festive Seasonal Updates like last Halloween or thematic DLC's... We've been playing this game on a regular basis and [b] still haven't pushed through all the content! [/b]

There is a truly HUGE amount of variety you‚Äôre getting here. Since the Room Creator allows for almost endless creative freedom and the possibility to mod as well, the community rooms expand the already rich content of the base game even further! From horror and unique science-fiction takes, abstract art puzzles and medieval themes to safari like exploration of catacombs! You can decide which kind of different experience you want to get into every time you play!

I want to mention that this game is also perfectly fit for playing alone! Especially as a chill evening activity, if you just want to relax a bit. Yet the mere amount of laughs I've been able to share with friends are reason enough to recommend this to be enjoyed together! 

So what you are actually getting by buying this game, is an ever expanding repertoire of unique Escape Rooms! And a great sandbox if you like to create something yourself.
 -> Which, for now, isn't even closely conveyed through the price!

The base game comes with 4 levels, each containing 5 rooms to escape. As each room is meant to take 15 minutes each to complete, this gives you approximately 4 x 5 x 15 = 300 minutes (5 hours) of content. There are also 4 ""extra"" rooms that were added on as free DLC for seasonal events (such as Christmas and Halloween). These are generally a little longer. Santa's Workshop follows the standard 15 minute completion time, but Graveyard, Cats in Time, and 70's Room are all designated as 30 minute rooms. Thus, in total you are getting about 300 + 15 + 30 x 3 = 405 minutes or just under 7 hours. All of this for just 15 dollars is a pretty good value proposition in my opinion and I have not even mentioned the community maps yet. I should also mention that there are 2 more $5 paid DLC which add about 3 more hours each. 

Part of what also makes this game great is that all of the levels have different themes to their puzzles and environments. This helps each level have a fresh feel to it and also helps the modding community by adding more assets to the large pool they already provide. It is precisely the modding community that gives this game near infinite replay-ability, as new maps  come out almost every day and the game does a good job of curating the maps so you can find the most polished ones.

As for the gameplay itself, I found most of the puzzles to be pretty easy, with only a few rare puzzles really setting me back. Nevertheless, I love puzzle games and I had a blast solving all of the puzzles in this game. I would say that the experience is augmented when playing with friends as all of the rooms can be solved pretty efficiently in parallel and your friends can sometimes provide you with a much needed change in perspective to solve a puzzle.",1669275113,1669275113,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the offset, it offers players numerous levels to play through either alone or with friends, as well as a pleasant level creator. Most puzzles aren‚Äôt overly tricky to solve, and each themed room manages to stay fresh as it doesn‚Äôt feel like any of the puzzles have been recycled. The solution to each room often allows for multiple puzzles to be worked on at once, ensuring your partner finds something productive to do simultaneously. The devs are constantly working on more content, and Steam Workshop support makes for a technically endless amount of additional bonus content as well.

I had an insanely good time playing it with my partner in crime challenging ourselves to complete each level in less than 15 min while avoiding to use any hints and finding all tokens.

 [u]Pros[/u] 

+ Charming and vibrant cartoony visual style
+ Limited but lovely character customization
+ Intuitive and challenging puzzles
+ Supportive in-game hint system
+ Endless custom levels

 [u]Cons[/u] 

- No mid-level save option 
- A couple of minor bugs

Mixed feelings about this game. I've only played it solo, or working together with a friend sitting with me. 

Some of the puzzles aren't very intuitive (maybe I'm really stupid). I get this main idea of what I need to do, but it's not obvious how to do it. Also some puzzles need you to keep looking at different items and it can be frustrating, especially if you have a rubbish memory like me, to have to keep going back and forth. I literally had to get out a notebook to scribble things down to keep a track of it. It would be nice if you could look at a couple items at the same time, or have a virtual notepad to type relevant details down.

The hint system; mixed bag. Unlike a real escape room, where you have someone monitoring you who can give you relevant clues based off of how far into the puzzle you are, Escape Simulator can't be quite as intuitive, so often you understand roughly what you have to do but often (for me) not how to execute it. The little pictures tend to follow a pattern of an image of the player reading relevant notes (done that), then some more diagrams of things I already understand or have done. That can make the game frustrating in a not fun way.

It doesn't work exactly like a real escape room, but it has some of those elements. I don't want to be completely negative; there are interesting puzzles and things to do, though sometimes I wish the rooms were a little bigger, though given how bad I've been at some of them perhaps that would make it harder. 

If you're really into escape rooms and don't have the time/ability to gather your friends or family for a real escape room, this could be a fun diversion in the meantime.

Overall, I like it more than it annoys me. Not much replay factor, but seems like they're adding DLC and the like to keep things from turning stale.",1667046587,1667047436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most puzzles require too much reading while little puzzle. Bigger map loads slow and does not perform well in game. You cannot load the official levels to learn their tricks. Editor navigation is nightmare. Assets appear in official levels are not all in editor, basically you cannot create the cool rooms like the dev team did in the official levels. Obstacles causes a whole bunch of bugs. Breakable Objects are not categorized and cause bugs...

Wouldn't buy or recommend if it is not used on a level design course. If you want to create Escape Room games, better learn a proper engine like Unity or UE, even Game Maker Studio 2 or RPG Maker can create more impressive work because you can easily script them without the need to learn strange programming logic!!!

I would say if some logic in the editor is improved, then the feel would increase a lot. E.g. if I want something not visible when starting the game, I should have a property in this object, not another logic object called Activator, and set this in the Activator then link them together. If an object can be broken and designer can hide a key inside, then there should be a prepared way to achieve this easily, either through child-and-parent or have a behavior, not using a third object called Activator and ..... And the most important improve: rework the physics logic! I should be able to make a key pickable AND not influenced by gravity easily within its own object property window; if a breakable object is set to be an obstacle, when it is broken, the obstacle should be automatically removed....

There's not much to get into in terms of specifics. It really is just a game you can pick up and play alone or with friends for an evening of brain itching. Hope you like key locks, combination locks, and keypads!

I will say that, while the game allows you to play with upwards of 8-10 people, playing with 1-2 cooperators is most ideal. The base-game rooms are pretty small and there really isn't too much for more people to do.
If someone's holding onto something you need, you have no way of really knowing what that is unless they give it to you. Play with people who know how to communicate.

A few criticisms that probably can't be helped, but I still really like this game. I think it sets a good standard for the ""Escape Room"" style of puzzle games.

The Good:  Not much of a story here, you appear in a room and must find a way to open the door to escape.  However, you can find small notes/hints that can reveal some small details about what was going on.  There are several groups of rooms, each with a different theme.  This keeps things interesting and makes you want to explore every different room you find yourself in.  Puzzles also vary between rooms and themes keep them feeling fresh.  Once you‚Äôre done with a room, there‚Äôs not much of a reason to play it again as nothing is changed.  Fortunately, there are new rooms that come out from the developers and from the community that keep the game going.  You can even make your own rooms if you want.

The Bad:  The main issue I have is with the clock.  All of the puzzles are doable, but the clock kept putting unneeded pressure to look at hints.  I tried to ignore it, but it‚Äôs usually in a very prominent place.  The only other issue is with the inventory and how you can put quite a lot of things into your inventory bar and have no idea if things are useful or not.  I would not mind if there was a different way to view or go through your inventory once it gets crowded.

Overall:  I‚Äôd recommend this game to anyone who like puzzle games.  I originally got this after playing ‚ÄúThe Room‚Äù series of games and also wanting to try escape rooms.  Once you get started, it‚Äôs hard to put down.",1666229564,1666229564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To the review.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]  7/10
This kind of game is not graphic demanding and its not that type of game. My score of 6 is not a reflection of the graphics not being good its just not that type of a game and to put a higher number would only just pump up the overall score without the game being a AAA kind of game. The graphics are really good though each item is clear, and the designs are fun both base and community content. The rooms and environments are fun to play in and it never gets boring

[h1] sound and music [/h1]  5/10
Again, like many scores the sound and music is not something this game needs to or does well. Its basic with sounds of various objects being interacted with and the music itself I find to mute as it all gets quite repetitive and in the way after a while


[h1] game play [/h1]  9/10
This is where the game shines. This is a great sit back with your controller and work stuff out chilled out game. It will get you brain going and a hand pad and pen will be needed to note stuff down. You play themes levels each with puzzles tied into that theme all blended with superb environments. The solo game is great for chilled out games and the coop is so much fun when you want to have a blast with a friend solving the rooms. The game play is a warm welcome when you want a break from the RPG and shooters in your library. This is a go to game every now and again when I want a break and not be hunched up over my desk.

[h1] controls [/h1]   8/10
Overall controls are great not many buttons and all of them placed perfectly on the game pad with the exception of a couple things like placing stuff around or dragging items but nothing too game breaking. Not sure about using a keyboard and mouse but I would imagine these are fine as well but this is a great game for once to lean back in a chair away from the monitor to play with a gamepad. 

[h1] Story [/h1]    7/10
Again its hard to put a higher score on the story as its not the kind of game that has a story other than themed escape rooms all linked in to each other however the puzzle writing and concept would play a part in the story for each room and these are done very well


[h1] conclusion [/h1]    
The game is a gem and one that has come a long way and compared to many in the genre this one has the brain teasing fun element with its cartoon style graphics and challenging puzzles. The community-based content is great as well to see what ideas others come up with. With regular community rooms added daily and monthly you are never to short of having a challenge with also the option to make up your own escape rooms as well. Solo or coop this game is perfect in your library of games when you want something relaxing but also challenging without the mouse and button mashing 
Overall solid 36 out of 50  for the game  This game gets a star buy token as it is a great game 
The overall score is not reflection of the game itself as this game is quite unique to most other games where graphics, score , sound effects are important elements of the game. This game although looks good does not depend on nor does it try to be the best in these areas and that is why the review is scored low in these areas and not because they are bad

Gameplay in both solo and co-op modes are functional, although there are some graphical and physics glitches.  I have experienced items vanishing (requiring restarting the entire room to regain them) and combination locks skipping numbers (requiring multiple attempts to get a known combination to ""take"").  But if you are willing to put up with these minor glitches, the official rooms are great, and the Community rooms we've played have all been a joy, as well!

My wife and I are having a blast playing weekly with our grown son, who lives across the country from us.  We just use our phones to talk during the game, and coordinate our puzzle-solving that way.  We have found Escape Simulator to be enjoyable for the whole family!

PRO:
Great co-op fun for the whole family.
Reasonably priced!
Tremendous number of available rooms.
Varied and entertaining puzzles.

Minor glitchy graphics and physics.

The dev. created puzzles are interesting and challenging.
Playing the first few rooms you are greeted with a great puzzle to space ratio, the only problem is that the rooms are kind of smallish.
With the Steampunk DLC the rooms are more spacious which give the player more room to move around and explore!

The community created rooms are very hit or miss in my opinion.

If you‚Äôve played any similar games most of the puzzle types will feel familiar. Search around the room and look inside drawers and other containers to find keys and other important items and clues. Decipher symbols and riddles to identify numbered codes, use letters to spell passwords, rearrange pictures into the correct order, and use spare parts to repair machines.

Most of the puzzles are well designed. The store page seems to suggest that playing coop is best, but I had no problems playing solo. In most cases the puzzles need to be solved one at a time anyway to acquire the next item or clue that is needed to solve the next puzzle. It took me 9 hours to complete the official rooms and in addition to this there are community designed rooms which I haven‚Äôt tried yet, so there‚Äôs a lot of content. 

However, this game has one significant flaw ‚Äì your progress within each room is not saved. If you exit the game before completing a room, you‚Äôll have to start that room again from the beginning.

One of the most important tools in my puzzle solving arsenal is simply walking away when I‚Äôm stuck, and then trying again later. Usually when I come back to a puzzle and look at it again with fresh eyes, I‚Äôll see something that I missed before, or I‚Äôll have a different idea about how to interpret the clues. But doing that in this game could mean losing 10-15 minutes of progress on multiple other puzzles within the room, so on the few occasions that I was seriously stuck, I felt pressured to solve it immediately.

There were a few times, especially in the space and office themed rooms, where I needed a 3 digit code to enter into a 0-9 keypad, but because there was something that I didn‚Äôt understand in the moment and I didn‚Äôt want to have to do the whole room again, I just sat and brute forced it. 000. 001. 002. 003. And yeah, I got it done eventually, but I didn‚Äôt enjoy having to do that. If the game would save my progress, I‚Äôm sure I would have been able to solve those puzzles properly, which would have been much more fun.

Overall Escape Simulator is a good game, but that one serious design flaw causes some moments of extreme frustration that I don‚Äôt usually feel while playing my favourite puzzle games.",1663195541,1663195541,True,28,2,0.739007949829101563,0,True,False,False

Then why is it bolded to begin with? Maybe this is the norm for other escape simulator games, but as someone who has only ever done in-person escape rooms this method feels intentionally misleading.

You and up to 2 other people if you want to, are put into, as the title suggests, escape rooms and you have to get out. The interactivity with items is great and leads to many puzzle possibilities. Most of the campaigns are great, although a few levels of a certain campaign and one level from another were frustratingly obtuse. Its a good thing that these levels are the exception, so that should not be a big concern if you want to buy this. The majority content is great and quite creative. Aside from escaping the rooms, there are also trophies you can acquire if you can complete the rooms under a certain time constraint. If completing them quickly isn't your thing, there are also optional hidden tokens in the rooms. 10 tokens in each room. I will say though that these usually weren't fun to find and were unusually difficult. Sometimes they are found inside or under objects that you can hold and some of these rooms can hold a lot of individual objects, so finding them can get quite tedious. There are also a few tokens that are out of your reach and you have to look at it from far away and somehow use telekinesis to grab them. Its very odd

The only other complaint I have is a sort of personal one and I don't expect many others to share this as a negative, but the levels are, in square footage, mostly quite small. This is made worse if you bring multiple people. You might start to feel cramped in the rooms. I personally wish the rooms were larger in size.

 If you like puzzle games and have Steam friends that like puzzle games, this is a must buy. that's not to say this game in unenjoyable alone. Being by yourself helps with the small space anyway. I would also heavily recommend  buying the Steampunk campaign.

My main issues, though, are that: You won't get your money-to-time's worth out of the game if you're ok to good at escape rooms or puzzles, they did a paid DLC before adding a signifigant amount of more rooms to the base game, and Custom rooms <that can have wack logic> have NO hints despite being heavily focused on by their social media and steam posts.

Really just a case of not enough in the basegame, and too much reliance on community content for longevity. (Usually that wouldn't be a problem...

It's not that the puzzles were bad.. They're pretty good actually.
But every level is like 2m^2, tiny and claustrophobic. 
I don't suffer claustrophobia but still I'm sure I would like it way more  if the levels had the same content but 3 times the space at least.  
Aklso there's too much clutter you can pick up and interact with that is just visual trash. You get a feel soon what is trash and what is important but still.  why does the game let me pick up every individual shard of a busted vase if no shard is important?

the unappealing design of the player character is not too relevant but it doesn't help the game.

Honestly I kinda should upvote this because the puzzles are alright, but.. Due to the claustrophobic nature of every level I have to force myself to play it and that's not the mark of a game I'd recommend",1661129409,1661129409,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Top 5 pros:
- Great multiplayer experience with friends
- Cool puzzle
- Easy to learn hard to master
- Great use of the zoom system on objects
- Enough levels to enjoy + level editor if needed

Top 5 cons:
- You NEED friends
- Some puzzles are b*llsh*t
- Limited to 3 players, if you are 4 1 will just be in the way
- Feels a bit short
- Nitpicking, but music if pretty bad

I will probably keep coming back to this game for years, similar to Human Fall Flat, just to see new dev maps and new workshop maps.

While definitely the best escape room type game out there, the levels also leave you wanting more. There are sequences to the puzzles where you keep advancing in the same biome, but they don't feel like they are a continuation of the previous puzzle, moreso just another puzzle in the same type of environment. I think this game would be a lot better if they could solve this issue. Many workshop maps have worlds designed where you feel like you are solving some grander puzzle throughout, with many connected rooms, entire houses, compared to the dev maps where everything happens in a 10x10 room.

Not too easy, not insanely difficult, but a really nice middle ground where you have to think, but there's no moon logic to get from puzzle A to B. 

The levels also flow really well together too, meaning once you unlock that 1st puzzle the next is right there ready to be solved.

Then there's the community levels. The main levels could be completed in a few hours depending on your skill level, so having all the community levels out there means you have an almost endless supply of fun on your own or with friends.

I also haven't tried any community rooms yet or the DLC.

Pros:
-The visuals are great
-The tutorial is excellent at explaining the mechanics
-The majority of puzzles have a clue on how to solve them in the room, as is usual
-Puzzles range from an immediate ""I know what I have to do for this one"" to ""what the heck am I supposed to do next?!""
-The sound which goes off when you get something right is a rewarding rush of dopamine
-Collectibles for all the trophy hunters out there
-Some silly things you can do in a few chambers (like throwing a skull in a fire) just for the lols
-You don't have to escape the room in 15 minutes (the timer on the wall) your first run; you can always go back and speedrun it for the trophy.  In fact, you'll probably wind up doing so
-A good amount of locations, and four of them have five different chambers to get through
-The community can make their own rooms which you can play through, giving the game even more life and making it worth the price
-You can customize your character; options are a bit limited, but it's still a nice feature
-Token hunting can be a fun breather if you're stuck on a puzzle; you might also notice something you missed that way
-There's a button on the wall you can press for a hint with zero time penalties


Cons:
-There are a couple puzzles which are very convoluted and have very little to go on
-The music isn't the greatest and can sometimes get annoying
-Each room can be completed in 15 minutes; from what I heard via research, IRL escape puzzles tend to count down from 45 minutes.  On average, it took me maybe 20-25 minutes per room (except for a couple where I did solve it in the 15 minutes and a couple which took longer)
-Some of the tokens are in places which are difficult to click on
-It can sometimes be difficult interacting with objects (mouse and keyboard), as I've struggled to get a clean circle with the mouse plenty of times
-Speaking of interacting with objects, some tokens are hidden under chairs and the only way to get them is to manage to knock the chair over.  This involves pretty much moving the chair as quickly as possible into every wall/object in the room in hopes that it'll fall over.  It'd be nice if there was some button or ability to turn a large object on its side
-Sometimes, the hints from the button on the wall are not relevant to the puzzle you're trying to solve, and other times are just pointing out something so stupidly obvious that it shouldn't have even been a hint (example:  one hint basically highlighted the very obvious item on the floor and had an arrow pointing to the even more obvious place where it goes)


Overall, this is a great game for both lovers of escape the room genre puzzles and newbies looking to take a crack at it.  I feel like it's worth its $15, though some people might easily blow through the game in a few days.
I highly suggest having some paper and a pencil/pen handy while playing (or an app open on your phone) to jot down the combinations as you slowly piece them together (particularly the ones with ciphers).  That will also help you to speedrun the chamber for the trophy later on.",1657855064,1657855242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. MORE levels! After you get through the initial levels, you can only play community-made levels. 
2. The hint button. It's helpful, but the first hint that comes out is whatever step you're supposed to do at the beginning of the level. So, if you only have 1 more key to find or door to unlock, you have to spend a lot of time clicking through all of the hints that you've already solved. Also, if you've just clicked the button, you can't just click it again for another hint, you have to wait 15-30ish seconds.

I quite like this.  After having played it, and seeing the amount and diversity of the content you get, I would have paid easily double the asking price, and I didn't buy it on sale.  It's basically a computerized version of an in-person escape room, complete with opening drawers, taking things off the walls, and, of course, multiplayer.  It's executed astoundingly well -- you can pick up and examine objects, both in your inventory (which has unlimited capacity, item stacking, and a self-configuring hotbar) and in the world, to turn them around, interact with them etc.  If two or more people are interacting with the same object at the same time, you can see each other's mouse cursors.   Each room has a time limit, but since it's all virtual and no one has a schedule to keep, you can keep playing after the timer runs out, and the only difference is that when you eventually do complete the puzzle, you don't get the trophy icon for it.

I've only played the Omegacorp line and part of the Edgewood Mansion line, but I've thoroughly enjoyed both.  Omegacorp feels like it was made specifically for me, especially with the vintage computer references near the end.

My one gripe is that the rooms feel a bit claustrophobic, especially with the amount of objects in them and the avatar(s) of the person/people you're playing with (even though they don't have collision).  Also that I haven't figured out a way to customize my avatar yet (although there probably is one).",1655623874,1655623874,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Taking an inordinate amount of time to compare spreadsheets isn't fun or challenging. Not having all of the data because you can't tell which muddled clue goes to which incongruous lock causes all victories to feel hollow as in you didn't solve a puzzle you just guessed; only rewarding a sense of relief that you don't have to play that level anymore. 

With controls feeling wildly different based on what level you are in or what you are interacting with and no reasoning for the change, the fact that you can accidentally hide clues from a coop partner, being unable to view/compare information without awkwardly wasting time trying to prop up or balance objects on a viewing surface and just the coin flip nature of whether a room was designed by someone who knows the definition of ""puzzle room"" and not a mouth-breathing, incontinent ape that just crapped puzzles into a room shows this game needs way more polish.

There are community levels available in addition to the smattering of hit and miss levels included which could lead to a huge variety of well put together maps and massive replayability but until they fix or remove some of the poorer elements I just can't recommend this game.

Worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975.
In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these over 650 million were obese.
39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016, and 13% were obese.
Most of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight.
39 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2020.
Over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 were overweight or obese in 2016.
Obesity is preventable.
What are obesity and overweight

Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health.
Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2).

Adults
For adults, WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows:

overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; and
obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30.
BMI provides the most useful population-level measure of overweight and obesity as it is the same for both sexes and for all ages of adults. However, it should be considered a rough guide because it may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different individuals.",1655352620,1655352620,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The only problem I have with it is the creating your own room ability. For people that just want something simple, like clicking on what you want and incorporating it into your own room/world isn't something this game offers. It makes creators have to go in and re-skin objects of any kind if you want something specific. Like a keypad, if you want to make your own little keypad you have to make your own little buttons and go in a re-texture the buttons to look how you want. Now this does give people more creative freedom yes, however, for me I have no idea how to re-texture skins. Some say it's easy, I say for someone who's never messed with texturing in their life that it is not in fact easy as people say. Would I like them to add some more items and tools for those of us that don't exactly know how to do everything? Yeah, but are they gonna listen? Probably not.

Pros:
The game is fun.
The game is (relatively) cheap.
There is a level editor, so there is, theoretically, infinite content.

Cons.
For the amount of content you get, this game is overpriced.  You can beat all official content in a couple of hours, and there's no replayability since once you've solved the puzzles you'll know how to solve the puzzles.   There are 21 official levels (4 scenarios with 5 levels each, and a 1 shot christmas level).  

For multiplayer, everyone must have a copy of the game, even for local play. The $15 price tag multiplies quickly if you want to play with friends, and since you can only really play the game once, everyone needs to get it before you start.

The level editor has a steep learning curve and lacks polish leading to a big gap in quality between official maps and player made maps.  The devs simply get access to tools and options that players do not.

The game has a lot of bugs, especially in custom maps.  You will probably find yourself having to reset the game and start levels over again because items drop through the world when you place them.

Final Verdict:  If you love escape rooms, and have someone you can play it with, grab it on sale.

Edit:  I can no longer recommend this game.  It was already overpriced, but now they've decided to start charging for content drops.  Considering they're leveraging free labor from players for 99% of their content,  charging $5/pop for new official rooms is an insult to injury.",1641292335,1654909426,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ Can finish a room during a long coffee-break

- Rooms are tiny
- Each room is a level
- A few bugs break puzzles (but a quit/restart resets them)
- Can't save your game / progress mid-room/level

It's fun, but I was expecting levels to be multi-room affairs where you unlock and progress as you go. Instead, each room is it's own self-contained puzzle. You do all the things in the room, and win when the door opens. So.. yeah.. it's an ""escape room"". Literally.

But, it just feels confined and odd like that.

The puzzles are good brain teasers, but a few get a bit obtuse with the hints. Even the hint panel that drops card hints to point you in the right direction is a bit obtuse to helping out.

I've experienced a bug or two that broke a puzzle. (EG: there's a puzzle in the Egypt area with a sun, camel & scorpion that have to get positioned correctly 3x. Not sure why, but I guess I moved things around so much that it broke the puzzle when trying to get the 3rd position. I knew I was doing it right, but it wouldn't register).

You can restart a level to fix the bug, though.

But, this brings me to my biggest gripe:

...No way to save progress mid-level.

The puzzle rooms are small enough you can finish them in 20 min or so... enough time for a break.

But, I started one to kill about 10 mins before a meeting at work towards end of my lunch. I made progress, and wanted to save. Nope. Sorry. No save. Exit, and then come start over again when you have time.

I don't know who made that design decision, but it's annoying. I often have limited time to play games. I don't want to have to start my progress over again simply b/c I didn't have enough time to finish a level. It's the 21st century for crying out loud. Cut us some slack. Some of us have lives that interrupt us out-of-the-blue.

So, because I know I have to play a level all the way through, I only start playing this game if I have at least an hour to kill. Because I don't know how long I'll take. And I sure as heck don't want to waste time.

Overall, it's good. I don't get the same feeling I get playing an escape room IRL, though. A lot of escape rooms these days are multi-room affairs where you progress. While this has sets of levels revolving around a theme and progressing you through, you don't get the same feeling as if they were all connected rooms in a single level.",1654040658,1654040658,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The base game has around 5-15 hours of game play, depending on how quickly you figure out some of the puzzles and whether or not you use guides. Replayability isn't super high, but can still be fun if you're with a new person / group of people and let them do most of the problem solving. The game really shines with community content, as there is high workshop support including monthly spotlights of the most popular rooms made and semi-regular contests. As of this writing the DLC isn't out yet, but $5 USD for it again is very reasonably priced and is definitely something I'm looking forward to. 10/10, highly recommend this game. Very relaxing, the community rooms are often as good or better than the base game, and even when not are often hilarious.

Edit:
I don't recommend this anymore now to see that they only added two one room levels, one of which is an ad for their other game and the Christmas one feels like it was barely any effort. I'm really disappointed in these developers for making us feel like they were going to add more official levels to the base game to only come out with a DLC now and just push community rooms. I get community rooms are great and all, but we were lead to believe there was more coming to the base game and it's extremely disappointing there is not after what felt like a great start to a seemingly early access game.",1639894687,1653757339,False,3,0,0.559412539005279541,0,True,False,False

1. Some objects in the editor are set to pickable when it would not make sense. e.g: Pillars are set to pickable by default which is not very convenient.
2. There is no jumping, having jumping would have so many opportunities for rooms. And to ensure no old rooms get messed up by it, make it toggleable and set all old room to no jumping and all new rooms to jumping by default.
3. Have it so you can turn off the ceiling lights. Them being set on all the time sometimes ruins certain things.

Pro:
+ 4 thematic escape room ""campaigns""/themes with 5 interesting and entertaining maps: Labyrinth of Egypt, Adrift in Space, Edgewood Mansion, Omega Corporation.

+ Additional EXTRA maps from the developers may be added in the future (currently there are two maps, which are also very fun).

+ Lots of Community maps to play which are also very enjoyable.

+ 4 ""best of"" maps are selected every month, so you can come back every now and then to enjoy the ""best"" community maps with your friends or alone.

Contra:
- Sometimes items can fall out of the map and cannot be restored (but key items spawn at a fixed point. At least in the official maps, so don't worry too much).

- Community maps fun rate may vary so first check the reviews out before playing them. 

- Text may appear unreadable/pixelated. Tip: Sometimes it helps to close the readable object, go a view steps away from your current spot, open the object and try to read it again.",1653038878,1653039549,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

This is a great game, which I'd recommend buying [i]someday[/i]... just not right now.  It's currently extremely buggy and unoptimized, to the point of being nearly unplayable.

The game claims it's running at 120 fps, but it's more like 20-30 fps, thanks to massive microstuttering.  I've played literally hundreds of first-person PC games, and this is one of the only ones to ever give me motion sickness. That's how bad the stuttering is.

This microstuttering also effects the game physics(!?!), because during a stutter players and objects can phase through floors and walls.  It's [i]really[/i] not fun having to start a map over because one of the players phased through the wall and can't get back in, or some essential object fell through the floor and can't be recovered.  This happens so often that [i]most[/i] of the maps my friends and I have tried have become unbeatable at least once.

The game has a feature where it can automatically download the host's chosen custom map from the Steam workshop, except instead of doing that, the game just freezes and needs to be alt+f4'ed.  The same thing happens when choosing ""quit"" from the main menu (lol?).

All of these issues have existed for as long as I've owned the game (5 months). The developers know about them but, so far, have not fixed any of them.  So while the massive amount of user-generated content is great, I'd highly recommend holding off on buying it until these issues are fixed.  If they ever are, I'll update this review to a positive.",1650770181,1650770595,False,4,1,0.464810550212860107,1,True,False,False

By that i mean, the rooms are setup with loosely interconnecting puzzles, but often dont make sense in terms of the room context. Mostly its gamey mechanics and puzzles, which can sometimes be quite difficult, but not all that interesting. Boils down to literal numeric codes to find and enter; a sequence of actions to perform in an order; arranging items in a correct order.

The puzzles just exist in the room as means for something to do, not that there is some thought out context for why the room is the way it is. So items would be placed illogically in places, if you think about how the room would be naturally setup. Like a broken fuel cell that you have to repair on a broken space ship, but all it needs is a battery item, which happens to be locked in a safe, so you need to find a code. Why? Because you're not supposed to think about it, just do the puzzles in order. Context is irrelevant.",1650007045,1650007045,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

After playing the demo, I really enjoyed going through the rest of the rooms. It is great for a blind playthrough, but because the solutions aren't randomized the rooms aren't worth replaying unless looking for the tokens you missed. I liked that there is a hint button but some of the hints aren't helpful as I know what I'm supposed to do but am missing a vital piece of information. I like the background music and some solutions being hidden in plain sight. As a chemistry major and teacher, I approve of the chemistry puzzle room.

Why is it worth your time? The base game has several themes - each with 5 rooms. These are all well done and also include secrets to go back and find after you've solved them once.

But it's the room editor that makes this game so great. Theoretically, endless numbers of rooms can be created by other users and shared so they just keep coming! I've completed the base game - although I haven't found all the secrets yet - but I keep finding new rooms to play in the workshop. And there's a nice workshop browser included in the game so you don't have to leave the game to find a new room. They've also got sections for top rooms. I haven't tried to create a room myself, but I'm definitely looking forward to that eventually.

The game also has multiplayer, but I haven't tried that yet myself. I've shared my screen over Discord and found that works well, but the true multiplayer experience is probably a closer version of an actual escape room. I imagine it's lots of fun, but since I haven't tried it, I can't say for certain.

Imperfect things: Occasionally I've run into a bug or two - usually in a workshop room - but the game is very stable in my experience. The graphics are generally bright and on the simple/cartoony side so if you require grit and photo realism, you won't find it in this game. The audio is fine and the controls are reasonable, but it takes a while to get use to some of them. (Even though I play the game a couple times each week, I still forget how to do some things from time to time.)

Overall, I'd say this is probably one of the best games I've played in terms of value for the money so I'd definitely recommend it if you're at all interested.",1649091780,1649091780,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Love the character customizer as well but would love to see more clothes and hairstyles in the future. Community level editor and workshop is definitely gonna keep this game alive and would recommend for that feature alone.

Some gripes. Community levels in coop are sometimes janky loading in with larger parties >3. The default camera can induce motion sickness but they have settings to alleviate this. Would be nice to have adjustable sprint speed since some of the community levels can be quite large and it's a bit of a slog to walk around.

Particles (especially moving particle physics) lag the hell out of the game, and the lack of WASD (keeping this point, although it's not true - see EDIT) camera mobility while building is extremely dated. This is the only thing holding back the game from growing, as simple commands complicit to your average 3D builder are just flat out missing or not made obvious. 

EDIT: There is a tutorial mode to help explain some of the controls, including WASD + RMB movement. I'm not certain why they didn't go for WASD only off the rip, but it's not too difficult to adjust to WASD + RMB. There still need to be information icons (i) next to some of the options for objects and their parameters. The tutorial explains some of the more ambiguous terms, like ""Is Sticky"". The system can still get convoluted depending on what's ""parented"" or ""child"" specifically with moving objects. It would be nice to be able to add additional animations to a single object. More complicated logic options are possible, but again very confusing to set up as you have to use empty objects rather than modify the physical object directly. 

Escape Simulator is a great game and may potentially be an escape room killer on the PC in terms of competition. There will always be smaller more theme/story specific puzzle games going against it, but this game offers much more potential content via the workshop. This is assuming a community grows around their in-game room builder and amasses a large enough collection of escape rooms. I would say the room building confusion is their biggest bottleneck. It's very simple in design, but deceptively tricky to add more complicated puzzles.  It's just tedious to use and be creative. The room builder UI needs clarity. They've already added specific room descriptions - something I mentioned in my first review - which suggests that they're reading and updating the game per user requests. This is good news, and shows promise for their game if they now work to make it more polished/glitchless. There are some truly well made community rooms already, and I hope to see this game grow even more with its fan made content. 

Escape Simulator severely relies on such content. The base game isn't as elaborate or extensive as I would prefer, but they do scratch that basic escape room itch. Asset addition will always be welcomed, and there is a good amount of unique objects already. 

The multiplayer works well on average, although players should be able to join/rejoin mid match. Objects can also easily get lost, therefore soft-locking the room. Right now the game just needs some optimizing and general quality of life improvements for item interactions. It's not a game breaker, but these are points that need addressing. There is a ton of potential in this game all around, and it has already shown promise as is. It's not 100% there yet, but what is here is already very fun if you search hard enough.",1643854322,1648757815,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Escape Simulator is an escape room simulator in which you and an optional small group of friends can attempt to solve puzzles in order to escape a room. The game features several themed areas with 5 rooms a piece in that same theme. Each room will have several puzzles to solve, typically in a linear pattern, before you can escape said room. Graphically, the game looks great for what it is, and the music and sounds are very satisfying. The rooms and the puzzles themselves are challenging and will hit a niche for anyone who adores these types of mental work outs.

With workshop support and several hidden tokens to find, replayability is not at all an issue. I myself played with a friend sitting next to me as we worked to solve these rooms by ourselves, and we had an absolute ball. When she wasn't yelling at me to not brute force my way through a puzzle, of course! 

My only real complaint are the controls. Using a mice and keyboard, I found it rather awkward to grab an item and shuffle it into my inventory, as well as handling items as a whole, which you will be doing a lot of. Combining items especially is something I think could use a little more polishing, but the game is playable regardless of the awkward feeling.

If you love puzzles and find the idea of an escape room appealing while your friends yell at you to turn around and check that wall one more time, than you will love Escape Simulator. Give it a go!",1640224040,1648414611,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only two suggestions:

- No way to point that I could find. I'd like to be able to have a line drawn from my character to the object I am pointing at visible to the co-op partners. This would make verbal communication a lot less tiring.
- Graphics could be better. Yes I realize this is not a big budget title, but in the future if they have success they should really work on ramping up the graphics and be less cartoony.

It works well as a 2 player game, but there isn't a ton of synergy. It's more like we can each do our own thing and eventually we solve bits and pieces of a larger whole.

Most of the Puzzles are excellent. They aren't too challenging nor too easy. The difficulty ramp isn't steep, but there is an increase as you progress through the game. The puzzles are also extremely creative. There are 25 main puzzles (Levels) that are divided into (5) themed based sections. If you're an average speed the levels should take 10-15 minutes.

There is probably some hidden lore to all of the puzzles, but it's not essential to know. I haven't completed it yet so I don't know whether or not there is some sort of ending. If there is great, if not it's fine.

I will say that my playthrough of the game has been a bit glitchy at times. It's not horrendous, but it does create a minor annoyance from time to time. The mobility in this game is also lacking, but that's not a vital part to a puzzle game. The physics engine for the game is also rough. It creates some dumb moments, but again not essential to the fun.

Overall I definitely recommend this game if you're into puzzle based games. It was super fun. As a bonus once you've finished the main levels you can build your own, or play community levels. The amount of puzzles are endless!",1648335246,1648335246,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only thing really holding it back is the relatively limited amount of first party content. The room editor and workshop support could *theoretically* make up for this in spades. However, my experience has been a bit hit-or-miss.

The developers have divided their escape rooms into a handful of themed sets including an old mansion, a corporate office building, an Egyptian tomb, and even a space station. Each of these has a number of individual rooms that loosely tell a progressive story. The puzzles within do give you a good bit of challenge while still being readily solvable with all the materials they give you, though also having a system to dispense hints should you need them.

There's also *some* amount of replayability to be had with each room having eight bonus tokens hidden quite stealthily within, in addition to the puzzles for escaping the room. I still have only found a handful after a good bit of time looking around while completing the rooms. Although, that and the awards given for completing the rooms within the time limit without hints haven't really kept my attention for the long haul.

It does have both solo and cooperative play. I'd say the sweet spot there is two players at most personally. It seems like most rooms have just enough materials to keep the both of you busy on something. Having played in a group of three for most of the game, it personally felt like we often had situations where one player didn't have a heck of a lot to do because the other two were holding all the reference materials for the puzzles that could be actively worked on.",1648200147,1648200147,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The levels that are included in the game are very engaging and brilliantly designed.  I managed to get through all of them without cheating if you don't count slamming that hint button repeatedly on some of them, which is a testament to their intuitive design.  There is a respectable amount of these levels, but I wish there were a lot more of them.

    Where the game fails is it's dependence on user-made levels.  I can see this as a fun way to make custom escape rooms for your friends.  However, when you compare the user-made rooms to the developer made ones even the highest-rated, most-downloaded rooms feel like a confusing-mess.  It's a shame the game seems to really push you to download these user-made levels too.

    If the difference between $15 and $10 means nothing to you, go ahead and buy it.  Otherwise, I would wait for a sale because there is maybe 10 hours worth of developer made levels in this game and they seem to still be adding more from time to time.  As of the time of this review I have about 16 hours on record for this game.  That's about 8 hours having fun (maybe less) completing the included levels, 2 hours trying to make the user maps fun, 6 hours left the game running while I was doing other things.  hopefully, that can give you an idea of what to expect.

This game has content alright, the base game should already keep you busy for around 5~6 hours. Then you're treated with community maps and workshop maps, so tons of replayability on that note. Moreover, some of the puzzles are actually smart and I believe the difficulty is just right for all players, some puzzles will take more time than others but rest assured that as long as you looked, you would find the answer to the puzzle.
 
The trash can function is probably the smartest thing about this game. It allows players to actually remove items from your vision and then you can focus on the main tasks. Anyhow, know that your decisions remain crucial, you are the one who decide what to keep and what to trash and obviously, as a good game should allow you to do, you will be able to recover the items from the trash can. This can help your playthrough tremendously, eliminating any distractions would only help you reaching closer to the final piece of the puzzle. 

A small hint to the people interested in this game, LOOK AROUND! LITERALLY!

A good deal for what it has to offer. Also a great deal if you want to play escape room with friends online

Summary: Easily one of the best puzzle games on the market, Escape Simulator is a breath of fresh air that uses easy mechanics with simple logic to create a varied onslaught of puzzles that give you many ""AH HAH"" moments...when the puzzles make sense.

[i][b][u]What is it?[/u][/b][/i]
A First Person Puzzle game where you (and a friend if you have one) a locked in a small series of rooms with a bunch of puzzles needing to be solved to open the exit. There are 5 locations with 5 rooms per location plus some extra free rooms as well as a whole load of community content.

[i][b][u]What I Liked[/u][/b][/i]
95% of the puzzles were very well designed and were not so difficult so that me and my friend just had to look at a guide. We solved every puzzle ourselves and while some of them were more obtuse than others, most of them were really great. The hidden tokens on each level also gave an extra incentive to be really in-depth with your searching. There are a whole lot of community maps for you to try, the areas are great and it was an overall great experience.

[i][b][u]What I Didn't Like[/u][/b][/i]
There are definitely some puzzles that just don't make any sense and upon solving I remember thinking ""well that was stupid"". I also feel like there isn't enough original content for the price; 5 hours of playtime for the default maps isn't alot for $25+ and I would have liked to see more developer maps because quite frankly the community content is not as good.

[i][b][u]What I Would Add/Change[/u][/b][/i]
Nothing really, the game does what it does well. I think the game just needs some more content but gameplay wise everything is fine.

[i][b][u]Personal Thoughts[/u][/b][/i]
Escape Rooms are a very popular form of entertainment so it amazes me that it's taken this long for an actually good escape room game to come and not be 30 mins long or just straight up garbage. There is so much content you could deliver through this medium and this game absolutely does not have enough. 80 Hour escape room games with regular content updates is what I want!

The problems: 
(1) There's very little reason to have more than 2 friends join you as the puzzles require little to no teamwork to solve. I understand that it can also be played 1-player, so of course the rooms have to be designed that way. However I wish they chose to have excellent one player puzzles or excellent team puzzles instead of having just okay puzzles for both play styles.

(2) For the life of me I can't understand why there are so many lock, keypad, and combination puzzles. The best real life escape rooms use zero of those kinds of puzzles for an immersive experience. Of course in real life the more creative puzzles require much more and a much bigger budget. However this is a video game! Some of the clues are fun to figure out but why is the solution something as boring as plugging in a few numbers? I wish there was more interesting ways to solve things. 

(3) The area is a little too small, I wish it was slightly bigger. I play with 4 other people and we're in each other's way here and there. It also feels very cramped.

Overall it's a decent game and a good beginner practice if you want to try IRL escape rooms. However I think there are much better games out there (the ""We Were There"" series is really up there for me!)",1646104432,1646104432,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]SPECS[/h1]
This game can be run on low specs pc but you [b]need to lower the graphic settings[/b]. [b]Public escape rooms are a no go[/b] for low end users as it becomes super laggy with huge fps drops and frame skips especially when looking at certain objects in the public room. This is probably due to it being a public level that the assets (game objects) aren't as smooth as the official ones and as such, are not as bearable for a low end pc.
[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
The game really digs deep into your brain where you [b]don't need to have prior knowledge of anything[/b] but you only need to be observant, be able to differentiate between real clues and red herrings, and to be creative or have problem solving skills. Levels are categorized by their theme and there are no explanations about the levels, like the difficulty of the puzzle.
The other side of the coin is the gear pieces which is a side quest where in each level there are 10 pieces scattered across the room and is optional to complete. You can choose whether to scour the whole room while solving it or after you've done so (I haven't collected all pieces for a single room).
Another thing about the hints is that most of them [b]aren't really too helpful[/b] as the hint system is most likely to give you hints that you've already solved and thus wasting time due to the hints having a timer every time you use one (Note, I don't dislike the hints having a timer but about the hints not having a more 'written out' method of giving them out). The hints are also just a picture of what you need to do, highlighting the important parts with a red ink but some hints are not that understandable due to it just being a picture, this isn't much of a big deal though as this statement can vary from person to person where I might have hard time understanding some hints while others don't.
By the time I posted this review, the game only has more or less 5 sets/themes of escape room including the tutorial (each having a varied number of rooms/levels) where the latest release, as far as I know, is the Christmas one. If you wanted to have a game that has days of gameplay then this is not for you, unless you want to try solving the escape rooms made by other players. This is a [u]good 6-12 hours of gameplay[/u] that racks up your brain where you can also invite friends (they must have the game downloaded) to also suffer alongside you. Although I [b]haven't tried the coop[/b] as I am the only who owns this game in my friend group.
I [b]haven't tried creating a room[/b] of my own as I, myself, am not a good problem creator but from all the reviews I've read, it was quite easy to use linking puzzles and stuff where you can use in-game assets to decorate your room to fit a certain them.
[h1]THOUGHTS[/h1]
This is a fun game where I assure you that you would have tons of Eureka moments solving each room. Good game to play with for about 9 hours and can be a lot more fun if you have your friends with you stuck in the room.

Dated 25th feb 2022

Pros:
- Aesthetically very pleasing but simplistic and cartoony (various era styles for rooms).
- Game comes with many rooms to play in.
- Room editor to make your own or play community made rooms (more styles than in vanilla, they didn't use the existing medieval style design in vanilla puzzle rooms at the point of review so expect way more than what's already in the game).
- There is hint box that help you progressively for every current task so you're guaranteed to not be stuck.
- Coop exists and it has good coop mechanics when playing (you can look into the object that the other player is currently holding up).
- The puzzles themselves aren't repetitive (I don't remember feeling like I'm doing the same task again and again even if realistically a lot of it is the same mechanic in essence).

Cons:
- Rooms are small and few puzzles per room.
- Some puzzles hide the answer in background where you don't expect to see it (god damn rooms lit in the shape of numbers).
- You have to share a lobby code to play coop, there's no public lobby where you can play with randoms.
- You're sharing the few puzzles in coop and absence of randomness (number/answer randomizer) will lower replay value unless you resort to community puzzle rooms or are 1st-timers.
- Coop griefing - Items (a player could hold an item that is required to decipher a puzzle and not share it with you)
- Coop griefing - Shortcuts (in a few vanilla maps you can unlock the exit by knowing the password and since that's not randomized you can do a 3 second speedrun)
- The official discord channel requires phone number input.

Conclusion:
As a puzzle room game this was a very pleasant experience especially if you enjoy a 1-time run through it.

I love doing escape rooms, but for obvious reasons that's a bit tough to do right now. But this game is a great alternative and it takes out some of the more difficult/hard to manage parts of irl escape rooms. Planning a group activity and wondering if you're going to get trapped there forever!

+ It works great, even in online coop with 2 or 3 people.

~ There are 2000+ community rooms in the Steam workshop, but the quality of those rooms is all over the place. Most have the difficulty of solving a sudoku puzzle (not completely mindless, but not hard at all). I recommend looking for a curated collection of battle tested rooms.
~ It is clearly an indie game made by a small team. The rooms look polished, everything around it is functional, but very basic.

- Some desync glitches will occur in multiplayer when connection quality is poor.

- Items disappear in walls/the floor
- When somebody exits his detailed object view, while other players are looking at the same items, the game softlocks and you can't do anything, except listen to the other players moving about and waiting for you to drop some item that you have in the inventory, but can't drop because the game doesn't respond
- You get ""Reconnecting"" every like 2 minutes
""Reconnecting"" takes up to a whole minute
- The map is not synchronized, sometimes you have to repeat actions to get the same room-state as the other players
- The network usage is absurd, so much so that even on a gigabit wire you get massive lags
- Sometimes the mouse doesn't work, like, x/y movement is not registered
- The menu is buggy and sometimes soft-freezes when you can't click anything (esc and back don't work either) and have to wait for host to start the game
- When you load into a multiplayer game for some maps (daily picks!) some players consistently get errors and can't join
- It's not possible to rejoin a session mid-way
- There's no indication for ""recommended"" team size
- On the Poe map, my wife got stuck inside a door that opened. She could look around but couldn't move, crouching/sprinting didn't help
- The controls are smooth but janky

Graphics are nothing special, decent cartoonish style.
Sound design is alright, nothing special.
Gameplay and Control are a bit janky, the space you have in each room is too small that turns the coop game into a claustrophobic cluster fk, they should've added 1-2 meters to each direction to make it more spacious, keybindings are missing mouse featues (middle mouse, forward\backwards) which sucks, and the keybindings themselves are rather confusing, and don't explain what they're doing or how to use them, albeit there's only 1-2 keys that I still have no idea what is their usage. They could improve on the default key bindings imo, it's very confusing having many shared buttons instead of dedicated (although you can remove them).
Character customization is limited, you can only chose from 1-3 items (hat,clothes,gender,skin color, hair & facial, haircolor) , I couldn't find any way to get more clothing atm, hope they add in the future more items.
My biggest annoyance is the lack of marking where you can use certain items, which causes you to just pixel check everything with an item until you see it is usable at some place, and there's many duds to confuse people and are there just to waste your time.

Overall it's a solid 7\10 game.

1. The left click pick/right click inventory unless you do it quickly when it is left click left click. The delay between the flip in operations is just about the same length as to read the description. This is particularly annoying as left-click, pause, left-click is drop item. This is madness. 

2. Examining items - a lot of clues are in books, notes etc, which is fine. However the process of getting to the clue once you have picked up the item is

a. Number (or scroll wheel) and click to select
b. Space to examine 
c. Left click to open the book/note

I presume that this is so you can interact with the object in the examine state but for documents there is NOTHING to examine unless you left click. It just slows things down.

Graphics is good and clean. The pussles are quite fun. Some are hard and some are really easy but I guess that also depends a lot on you as a person.
We are 4 friends playing together and one ""world"" (5 levels) is usually enough for one evening before we are too tired in the head and play something else.

You can get hints in the game from a kind of machine that spits out a paper. Don't(!) use it until you are completely stuck because it makes the pussles really easy.

I definitely recommend this game but beware of the few bugs - hopefully they'll get fixed soon along with some new maps.
8/10

Bugs:
One where we did not see the same thing in a pussle - resulting in everyone trying to ""fix"" the problem individually until we all figured out we're not actually seeing the same thing. Caused all sorts accusations within the group.

Another bug (or is this a design...?) where only one person can interact with a pussle.
Person A tries it. Leaves.
Person B then tries it, see the solution but cannot turn the levers.
Person A is now trying another pussle (that it turns out only person C can use).
So we had to call out in the group ""who can use this? I know the solution but can't input it""
Person A returns to the pussle and listens to the suggestion from person B. Solved.
Steals a lot of time...

We think this is a bug where the one who tried it first, is kind of attached to it after that.

I was however met with one major problem right from the start: For whatever reason, the game was giving me extreme motion sickness. For context i play lots of first-person games and this isn't really a problem i've faced before. Something about the movement in Escape Simulator made me super nauseous. I've messed around with mouse sensitivity, FOV, turned off mouse smoothing, reduced the brightness as much as i could (this game is *extremely* bright) and even turned on ""anti-motion sickness"" in the menu, which didn't really help at all either.

I figured maybe i could still enjoy it if played in small bursts, so i waited a day and tried it again and yeah, i can play a couple rooms before i start feeling it, but it's still quite unpleasant and i really can't put my finger on why.

[b]As for the game itself...[/b]

I feel it might be unfair to judge it based on only 2 hours of playtime, but i can't get a better grasp without going over the 2 hour ""no questions asked"" steam refund period so at least from what i played (one full collection of rooms as well as the first couple of rooms in two other ones) it was a bit... underwhelming?

Instead of having a big interconnected space for you roam around and piece together puzzles, the collections are split into several extremely small self-contained rooms, with just a handful of puzzles in each and it's not that these puzzles are [i]bad[/i], it's just that the way they're presented is very straight forward. It feels way more like just a collection of puzzles than an escape room, like if someone was just giving you each crosswords prompt individually and have them be completely independent from each other. 

I've heard some workshop maps are bigger and have more intricate puzzles, but also heard the game gets really laggy in these (can't confirm for myself). It's also worth mentioning this ends up affecting co-op as well, since the puzzles are so self-contained everyone just kind of goes work on their own thing until the room is solved without actually requiring much communication/coordination.

Another weird aspect is the timer systems, it's common for real life escape rooms to put you on a timer so that you have to escape the room before then, which really gives you some adrenaline rush that makes the experience a lot more exciting. Meanwhile point and click escape games usually didn't do the same since failing to meet the timer would either require players to replay puzzles they've solved already or give up and never see the end of the game. The way Escape Simulator opted to do it is to give you a timer purely for bragging rights, you're not required to finish before then but you suffer no penalty for failing it other than not getting a lil' trophy to mark the occasion. It's an interesting solution but it ends up falling short, as the lack of consequence means the timer gives you no rush whatsoever (specially from how much time they give you) and if you do fail you're supposedly encouraged to go back in and solve puzzles you've solved already. 

Funnily enough, the time i had the most fun with the game was when i had to rush to try and finish a room before my 2 hours ran out, the adrenaline rush of trying to finish a puzzle under an actual time limit was the closest i had to an actual escape room experience (even if i don't really think a strict limit with actual consequences would work in a digital game like this).

Same goes for the tokens, which are collectibles you can find hidden in the maps. They're a nice bonus tbh, and it's fun to find them, but as a puzzle game i'm assuming it would be very unexciting to replay maps just to look for tokens you've missed (Though, granted, i haven't actually done that since i only have two hours of playtime to base myself in).

In any case, maybe all these issues i had with the puzzle design were only present in the rooms i've played, were it not from the motion sickness i'd be more willing to put more time into it and give it a more informed review, unfortunately as it stands this is near unplayable for me and together with my indifference to the content i am unfortunately refunding it for the time being. If the motion issue is ever figured out and it gets some more exciting maps (even if through the workshop only) i'll gladly give it another try.",1643920581,1643920581,False,6,0,0.491814941167831421,0,True,False,False

I'm not saying I am disappointed or that I regret playing it, it was fun, but less than I had imagined.

‚óã

Visually, the game is pleasant, a simple cartoonish style, that helps with recognizing the different objects without the details that a realistic style would require.
The issue is that they compensate with so many useless objects in every room, that end up cluttering the environment.

You could say that so many objects were put there to make it feel more like a real escape room, with lots of deceiving items, but you have an icon that helps you know if they have a purpose or can be discarded, so they are there just to clutter.

Honestly, at first I didn't notice that icon, and this made me realize how all those objects actually made it worse.
In a real escape room, you can use an object for what it is at least, here only some items actually do stuff.
For example, you will find a brush that can be used to clean, but the shovel just can't be used, and we lost some minutes trying to figure out if we could use it to dig.
This can be true for other kinds of objects too and can be frustrating.

‚óã

The other thing that was a letdown was the size of the rooms.
I was expecting every level to be at least 2 rooms before completing it, what I got was instead 1 room for every level, but the worst thing was that every level was like a 2 meter x 2 meter square room.
It was sooo tiny, it was hard to move, and imagine having it cluttered with objects, it was really annoying and felt unnecessary, they could have made them be at least a bit bigger.

About the ""at least 2 rooms"", I know that you have more levels for every story, but each of the level/room is completely separate from the other., while I imagined something with 2-3 rooms per level with a bit of backtracking.
The rooms, like they are now, feel like every one of them is a sort of demo of an escape room, but never a full one.

That's not to say I did not have fun, it was funny to complete the rooms, solving the puzzles, some of them are also somewhat original, but it wasn't as immersive and entertaining as I would have expected.

‚óã

As for the cooperation part, I think they did an overall good job at giving you multiple things to do at any time so that you can try to resolve a puzzle while someone else can solve another one, and then exchange information.
Or when u have to input some data from a paper and you ask the other one to read it while you do it.
These are probably the funnier moments.

There are times when it feels more linear but overall not much.
Maybe I would have liked more puzzles that actually require at least 2 people to do a thing at the same time, while there are really just like 2 or 3.

‚óã

I appreciate that they made an editor in-game, and also have tried some community rooms, like 6-8 of them.
Not much of course, but it's still a bit early to have a consistent set of good community rooms.
I played 2 of them that were actually good.

One where u and the other player have to go separate ways and so u need to tell each other what u see and communicate a lot. It was really fun and truly required cooperation, even though the actual puzzle were very classic/simple.

The other one was a big haunted mansion and was actually what I expected this game to be (maybe even a bit more than I would have expected). Was really funny and complete, with a story and lots of puzzles, the only issue is that it was very laggy, probably pushing the editor to its limits.

‚óã

Overall this is a nice game to play with friends (maybe alone could be not so worthy), and I think it will get better with time, if more official rooms are being made and if the community gets better at building them (and maybe with a better way to rate/discover the community rooms).",1643638662,1643638662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

These are hard! Feel like a real dumb dumb. So glad the hint button doesn't have a sarcastic 'Are you kidding me? It's right there!' remake every time you press it.

The visuals are easy to look at which I prefer than The Room games as I find those really dark at times. 

The escape rooms are small rooms but there's a lot to unlock and find in them so it doesn't feel your going from one end of the room to another working things out.

Only spent a little bit of time on it to get the hang of the controls but I can see it been an enjoyable game to play when I want to relax and want to focus on something else rather than overplaying in my head of how crappy my day was.

So while we were playing this I found my 10 year old son actually getting into this, so much even asking if we could play it.

[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]Can be a challenge but it‚Äôs not so overly difficult you‚Äôll find yourself looking things up.
[*]Our son even enjoyed this, and found some of these puzzles enjoyable. 
[*]Community content means the game isn‚Äôt over when you solve all the built in rooms.
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[*]We played through mostly with a controller in the living room. In a couple spots I had to walk into the office and use the mouse as it was absolutely necessary (IMHO) to complete the task at hand.
[*]Some of the hidden tokens might as well be invisible; we got some that we never even saw. We found by complete accident. Even after knowing where they are, I still don‚Äôt see them, the only clue they are there is the pointer changes.
[*]I wish the hint system gave hints based on the task at hand. You may get stuck on the very last task. However if you haven‚Äôt taken any hints, it will still spit out hints for the very first item.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1643460495,1643460495,True,9,1,0.407332390546798706,0,True,False,False

There are features implemented that increase extremely the quality of life and make the game very easy and comfortable to be played together with other people. 

For example, when someone is holding a piece of paper with a message in it and reads it, the other players can click on it as well and read it at the same time. Each player has a cursor that is displayed to all other players, so when you talk to your friends, you can also point onto the piece of paper with your cursor and your friends will see it. 
Another example of quality of life feature is the pinging system. You can ping at stuff.

And even if you finish playing all the rooms, there are Workshop rooms on Steam made from other people you can try out.

PSA: Don't throw items off the map. You can't pick them up and you have to restart the room.

While the story missions and puzzles are fantastic, you want the game for the Workshop! Infinite user generated content, many of which feel just as good to play as the story missions.
I've been playing with several friends online, and we keep swapping maps between each other, and playing in small groups. I especially love the cooperative based custom rooms that require 2+ people.
There are already so many creators that put incredible polish and design into their custom rooms, and the game is only 4 months old. New user generated maps keep coming out, and it keeps me and my friends engaged for hours on end.

Now, the worst part about the game is how stable it is. I've been experiencing frequent crashes, or connection issues between friends. Many times, I have some friends that are able to walk through certain walls and objects with ease. Other times the game just crashes when loading a map.

Spent more time in workshop content than official since after the first chapter it seemed to really wane on cooperative situations (at least the space station chapter there was like 1 thing to interact with at a time instead of the egypts 2+ at a moment). My gripes will be that there's no real standards either enforced by the developer or ""unspoken"" community expectations with custom created content that leaves a really wide interpretation process for every player created map not knowing simple things like projected difficulty level, geographic origin (really would help with some puzzles that require thought of mythology and other cultural differences on some things, etc), maybe even map size to gauge time estimates, and theme (I know we have tilesets but lets be real, that means nothing when you want a specific aesthetic for your puzzle - like saying Prof Windlenot's Museum in SHIVERS should have been 100% South American based due to the Ixupi focus).

I hope the developer continues to support the API for the community to allow new mechanics and features. 

Otherwise, despite sounding like I'm complaining - no I'm enjoying this a lot and I think if you want a nice puzzle game that you can play either solo or with a friend this is a great purchase. Just giving suggestions that I think could help players find content better and an expression that I hope they support it further to allow better longevity.",1642779817,1642779817,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wasn't sure about getting this at first as some of the reviews said it's more fun to play with others.  I'd mostly agree for any other game, but for this one I think I'd rather figure it out on my own.  I haven't played Co-op so can't say for sure though but I found single player to play just fine.

What isn't subjective, however, are bugs. We spent easily 20+ minutes on one puzzle because a bug preventing one of the items from being interacted. I loaded a solo game and was able to immediately interact with the thing that we couldn't interact with for way too long. Super duper annoying and suddenly breaks my ability to take the game at face value.

Another level later with pipes you turn? Unsolveable because the PIPE ROTATIONS GET OUT OF SYNC. Seriously guys?? It look connected on my screen and on my partner's screen it's.. not connected at all. Which one is right? This is utterly impossible to work around in a co-op puzzle-solving game.

Another problem - when a player is holding or interacting with an item you can look at it with them and see their mouse pointer.. except the pointers are out of sync. Where they are pointing is NOT AT ALL where their mouse is on their screen, meaning if you're working over voice you can't even indicate things as clearly intended by the devs.

Way too many bugs, hard no. Puzzle obtuseness and such is subjective, but constant game-breaking bugs are not.

Yet another puzzle further in in another episode, same error.. My partner could interact with and move an item on a clock, I could not whether or not they were interacting with it or not. Started a solo game and I could immediately interact with it. bugged :\

I also have to say.. as far as a *multiplayer* co-op games.. why are SO MANY of the puzzles offered ONE AT THE TIME.

Really nice to play with some friends, or in my case, my daughters.
I did have to buy the game three times of course for that to work, but we're having so much fun that it's totally worth it!

Yes, there are some bugs, most notably sometimes the multiplayer desyncs, causing people to see different 'states' of the room. That happens sporadically though.
What does happen more often, is that sometimes after one person has interacted with an object (eg. tried to solve a puzzle, but failed because you don't have all the hints yet), other people can no longer interact with that object. 
For example, there is a pipe-puzzle in one room. There are many pieces of pipe. If I touched (moved) on piece, someone else can no longer move that piece. So, then you really have to work together to solve the puzzle, because some parts can only be moved by some people.

A minor annoyance though, because it is really the best Escape Room Experience possible!
Also, the included maps are all very small, but the user generated rooms are often very large and are really of high quality, so this is a game you won't finish any time soon!",1641582272,1641582272,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Escape simulator lets you play escape rooms in 3D. There are multiple themes, each of them includes multiple rooms.
The rooms are quite small but got multiple puzzles in them Each room takes about 10-15 minutes to solve. This small design is working very well. The design of those rooms follow the theme and look pretty good. The puzzles got a nice difficulty and are logical. Only one small puzzle so far was a little strange.
Additionally all the puzzles allow experimenting and testing without any deadlocks.

Overall the experience was very enjoyable and the puzzles were very nice to play through.

A lot of players complain about network issues. I have played 4 hours in coop and did not have a single disconnect/ lag or any other kind of issue.
Additionally, thanks to all the small rooms, it is very easy to restart a room and just redo the puzzles you had solved already, as this takes only a couple of seconds. So even if there is a network issue once in a while, it should not ruin the fun too much. People complaining about dropping out of the session and watching their friends solving all puzzles, must have stupid friends. 
Of course when playing in coop you should not pick up items, but store them at a certain position in the room, so everyone can access them.
