I don't know how to navigate half of the tabs in the pause menu. A main thing i realized after playing for a while is that this game doesn't teach you the basics of forza, it expects you to understand the PI system even though this is my first forza game. It has been a long a while since i've played the 'tutorial' of this game, but I have a feeling that there isnt much of one if theirs players who don't know how to even upgrade and stay in a class. From my perspective, even if I haven't played other forza games, I think they just took the good simcadey handling model from previous forza's and did things half way with everything else. I don't know any of the npcs names in this game, I can't name any of them. There is essentially no story, bad menu design, small open world, dull car engine sounds, and an inconsistent, unrewarding, slot machine system that doesn't inspire getting better over time, but handing the newbies a hypercar without teaching them how to understand it. The only thing that is keeping me going is the good handling and I can bet that i could find better if it wasn't for the fact that there are so few rewarding, well made, decently running, simple graphics, racing games made nowadays.

I wasted ~$60 of my steam wallet for the premium edition and that was on sale. I will NEVER buy another Forza game on steam because of this. I have the information on the release dates and my purchase here:

-So, release of FH4: 3-9-2021
-I purchased Premium Ed. on: 4-8-2021
-FH5 released: 11-8-2021
-Support for FH4 ended: 9-27-2022

-Gypped ~$60 for a game I was able to play for about a year. Never again


When this game doesnt screw me over by crashing during the final race of a Trial, or letting me fall into a false sense of security with stability, I LOVE this game. Besides the obvious crashing issues I have the other issue I have is that when FH4 came out to Steam, it was like 4 months when they announced that they are stopping content updates for FH4 and getting ready to release FH5 for Steam in November of the same year they released FH4 for Steam. Besides the issues I listed, I love this game, I have wanted a Forza Horizon game since I tried the demo on the Xbox 360.

Honestly, I prefer this to the sequel in several ways. Forza Horizon 5 is beautiful in its own way, but it also ironically feels TOO big and empty. FH4's map is just right, and a lot more dynamic, especially with how dramatically the seasons change the map and the driving. There's a feeling this game captures that few racing/driving games have managed to capture, as you tear through the Scottish countryside and the streets of Edinburgh in your favourite car, music playing on the radio as autumn leaves whip around you. It's just an absolute pleasure to play.

Problems? Yeah, a couple. Sometimes, the AI on anything above the Average difficulty will choose at least one racer to be a ""Peter Perfect"", pulling ahead to the point it becomes more difficult to catch up than it should be (though to nowhere near the same egregious level as FH5 or Forza Motorsport 2023). Also some of the Quality-of-Life changes made in FH5, such as the ability to sell or donate duplicate cars immediately upon receiving them, are sorely missed. Also sometimes the Wheelspin's rewards are beyond a joke, but massive credit goes to the developers for not shoving in microtransactions.

EDIT 21/2/24: It turns out you CAN immediately sell duplicate cars if you win them via the Wheelspin. I honestly don't remember that feature being there before; maybe they added it in an update?

Forza Horizon 4 is just brilliant, in ways both tangible and intangible. Beautiful graphically and a ton of fun to play, along with the feeling of simple joy it gives the player through just driving and exploring. To me, this is as good as these sorts of racing games can possibly be.",1704756152,1708512819,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I think he was getting them from his older brother or his Pops. Cutting them precisely so that he doesn't notice a page missing.
Each Monday he refreshed his stash and we were so excited to get to school just to see what he has.
Sometimes he would have Pam A or other classics and he had to host an auction, man, cause everyone wanted to have it.
I tell you, he was popular. We would just cash out our daily allowance with a smile and fold that picture neatly in a textbook put it in our backpack and oh man, it would turn in to a JET PACK.

For those who enjoy an ""arcady"" racing game, Forza Horizon 4 does a good job.  There are multiple view angles for the car.  Handling has a classic arcade style.  Tuning is not overdone, and you can buy user developed templates for the cost of parts.  The normal racing styles (on and off road) are available.  There is a good selection of cars to earn as you work your way through.

On the downside, there are non-racing interface issues.  I may have missed something, but it appears that there are no private servers, so juveniles, or juvenile adults, can harass you by blocking your view when they drive into your car's space.  Progression between seasons is too fast and can be earned with non-racing accomplishments alone.  Every time you login, it insists on asking you to link your MS and Steam accounts...loading times are too long, especially the introductory movie.

This is an older game, but not worth the price MS asks for it, even on sale...I'd go $10 USD if I could do it again.  I'll probably get a bit of entertainment out of it, but not what I paid on a sale.

My overall review hasn't changed.  I cannot recommend this game unless you are a die hard arcade racing fanatic.  For those who prefer other genres and just want an occasional race, there are better options at better prices.
--------------------
As I write this review, I have half-an-hour of ""game play"" recorded.  That is how long it took to get logged into a MS account.  MS is their own worst enemy.
I cannot in good conscience recommend this game if you have any complications logging into MS, such as if your account and your child's account are linked through something like an Xbox.
I wish that I could talk about the game content, but I haven't been able to get there yet, and I need to put this game away and calm down after the nightmare of a login process.",1707065728,1708213337,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Car brand/model diversity is sufficient - even though it's sort of a DLC hell; sales are abundant, so you may easily grab it with a good discount (good price even without a discount thanks to FH5) and from what i've heard; it's better optimized and more player-friendly compared to Forza Horizon 5. Car upgrade and tuning mechanics might be better balanced but enough for an arcade-y simulation, i believe. Haven't tried the Fortune Island yet but i found the LEGO DLC unnecessary, just a waste of my hard drive space, really.

If you can live with that, it's a good arcade racer.

Pros:
* great open world, a beautiful interpretation of a mini version of the UK
* the scenery changes depending on the season (e.g., lakes freeze and you can drive over them in winter), which is awesome
* lots of content: tons of races, cars, and things to explore
* tons of settings, customization options
* there are different types of events (rally, cross country, street racing, ...) and nothing forces you into doing something you do not want to do. Real freedom! It's an open world that deserves the name, not just a boring map which replaces the main menu!

Cons:
* Annoying UI and menus
* The typical AAA game disadvantages these days: more DLCs and editions than you can count, and even if you buy the ultimate, there is still stuff for that they charge you extra.
* Presentation (always happy rich kid car festival crowd, main characters considers himself the coolest dude on earth, the music the loading screen animation of people cheering at you on stage with your car) is clearly aimed at pubers and feels borderline cringeworthy to me
* events (the races you start from the open world) are very short, typically about 3 minutes
* It does (almost) not matter whether you drive on the road or not, you have similar grip and speed in the woods and you can just drive through almost everything, even medium sized trees will just disappear in a falling tree animation and a minor sound effect without even reducing your speed. This means people drive everywhere and its often faster to go in a straight line rather than follow the roads, which can kill a lot of the immersion. You can even go through major rivers.
* bad mainstream pop music. In general, it feels like they wanted to please everyone a bit too much.

Neutral:
* It's clearly advertised as an arcade racer so I will not count this as a negative, but if you try to race with all assists off and manual shifting, you will find that this makes little sense: there are tons of races, each on different tracks, and you do not know the corners, so you need the racing line if you want to be fast. Also it's hard to turn off the rewind feature: because you can just drive next to the road (see above), races use checkpoints every 300 meters that you have to go through, and missing one means your position is reset and you lose a lot of time and have to restart. The solution if you missed one by accident is of course the rewind feature. And in the cross-country races, where you are sliding at high speed through the landscape with very little control, you will miss checkpoints sooner or later. This game is definitely a lot more about finishing hundreds of short races in hundreds of cars than about properly learning a few tracks and cars.
* Does not work with my new Fanatec wheel and paddles, they are not detected at all even though they work in ACC and Dirt 2. But as this could be a problem with the latest Fanatec driver according to forums, I am for now listing it as neutral instead of negative.


Overall 8/10 if you are looking for an arcade open world racing game to play with a controller. Just don't expect something too serious.

It's a pity they can't produce a world like this for more serious racing games with a smaller audience. But I'm a software developer and I can tell that this was definitely [b]not[/b] a low budget project. Forza 5 is a copy of this game where they replaced the UK map with Mexico, btw. I have both, and I slightly prefer 4, but it's just about the map.",1702475006,1708185166,True,1,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,False

FH4 for me has better map Quality even though it smaller than Empty and boring FH5's map, because in FH4 The map is actually filled with something and someplace can be really good looking, even Edinburgh map in this game is actually pretty accurate from a part of Edinburgh in real life.

FH4 also has Ranked Racing and a pretty good DLCs (Fortune Island and LEGO DLC) not like FH5 that doesn't have Ranked Racing and only 1 Good DLC (Rally Adventure).

Overall, Forza Horizon 4 is very recommended if you want to try Forza Horizon/Racing series because it has good map and good content. But remember that Forza Horizon 4 is not getting anymore new content (unless Festival Playlist Update / Monthly challenges if you don't know what Festival playlist is).

For years, I've had to deal with crap racing titles that start off easy enough, but amp up the difficulty exponentially as you progress through the game to the point where it's literally impossible to win a race. Thankfully, that isn't the case here; it's challenging, but not insanely difficult. There are plenty of activities including street racing, off road racing, drifting, jumps, stunt driving, (online, LAN, or solo) and more. 

I enjoyed the environments and the extensive collection of vehicles. Great visual and mechanical customization, too.

Of course, I also got hooked on the various Horizon races, of which there are great variety, from road races to cross-country events.

This game in particular I liked a lot due to these reasons:
1. Better setting than FH5. It feels more calming and soothing. The only reason I will play FH5 instead of this is cause of friends or more cars.
2. I like the seasons mechanism


CONS:
1. The races don't feel legit. The AI feels like cheating with a huge down force. The issue is continued in the FH5.
2. Can't control the weather. Once again the issue continues on FH5.

Not everything is strictly just racing, there's tons of other fun modes online as well like eliminator and things to do such as daily and weekly challenges with rewards to keep you engaged. You can even buy your own house in game and customize your character even with lots of cosmetic items, so there isn't a lot of expression in this game with the amount of options at your disposal.

Last but not least they even have a story mode split into chapters which reminds me a bit of the GTA missions.

Now onto the negatives that I personally have gripes with in the game, the DLC pop ups! If you only own the base game, the game will nag you pretty often with ""ad"" type cinematics that you can't skip after certain events and stuff and it doesn't just do this once, it does it constantly, when you just wanna get back into the open world and race it's pretty annoying. 

The music you can't shut off is pretty annoying as well, you can shut it off via streamer mode but it's still always on the loading screens, they should've had an option to turn it off completely.

Lastly the difficulty pop ups, when you're either winning or losing a certain amount of times, it'll ask you if you want to lower or raise your difficulty level, this I found to be intrusive because when I set a difficulty level I'd like to just leave it, not have it keep nagging me.

Overall it's a pretty decent racing game with lots to do, despite it's negatives I'll still be playing it because it's super fun and the positives far outweigh the negatives, so if you like open world racing games with tons to do and lots of customization, I highly suggest picking it up, final score is an 8/10 for me.",1707603775,1707603775,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

 I must admit that I just hate the cutscenes in the game. If it weren't for the cutscenes the game was perfect. I don't understand why the race or the mission can just start. The cutscenes are annoying and useless, they try to funny but the just get on my nerves.

I mean the graphics are amazing unlike any other, and the cars themselves are outstanding i mean so many to choose from, even now they are still adding more and more but of course there's so many yet never enough XD. The game play is perfect for any person who loves car/racing games. Although this game is a literal do what ever you want, race who ever you want(except regular civilians), and drive whatever you want(except for tanks and larger/military vehicles including jets, bikes, and boats). I don't want to accept this but i have to let it out tho...There Are Still many bugs and glitches, that i honestly cant even comprehend, i have found so many within the city and in little towns even to this day there is like 20+ bugs and glitch i have found just surrounded by the map, anyway there arent really any racing glitches, except for driving at a certain speed and just stopping instantly even within races but it doesn't bother me because IT IS VERY RARE TO HAPPEN, as in like less than .5% chance of happening because its never happened to me and i have been playing the game ever since it came out, and especially the other glitches surrounded by the map are actually ""FUNNY"", i find the glitches and bugs as another adventure looking for more and more ways to break the game, and its no bother to me so i suggest to fix the glitches that are some what messing up peoples games but keep the ones that are hard to find yet still funny in a way just to try and make people laugh and share with their friends :).

The game also features dynamic seasons, online multiplayer, and cross-play with Xbox One and Windows 10 players. However, the game is plagued by a serious issue on PC: it crashes constantly.

The game crashes at random times, sometimes during loading screens, sometimes during races, sometimes during cutscenes, and sometimes even before the game starts. The game does not give any error message or explanation for the crashes, it just closes abruptly and returns to the desktop. This makes the game unplayable and frustrating, as you lose your progress and achievements.

The game's developers, Playground Games, have not provided any official solution or patch for the crashing problem, despite the numerous complaints and reports from PC players. The game's forums and Steam discussions are filled with people asking for help and sharing their experiences with the crashes. Some players have tried various methods to fix the crashes, such as updating drivers, lowering graphics settings, disabling antivirus, verifying game files, and reinstalling the game, but none of them seem to work for everyone.

The game's crashing problem is unacceptable and disappointing, especially for a game that costs $59.99 (For India INR 1299) and has been out for more than two years. The game should have been tested and optimized for PC before its release, or at least patched afterwards. The game is a waste of money and time for PC players, and it should be avoided until the developers fix it or offer a refund.",1707019780,1707020025,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Released in October 2018, this open-world racing game has garnered widespread acclaim for its stunning visuals, diverse range of vehicles, dynamic weather system, and engaging gameplay.

One of the standout features of Forza Horizon 4 is its breathtaking recreation of a fictional version of Great Britain. The attention to detail is remarkable, with picturesque landscapes, charming villages, and iconic landmarks seamlessly integrated into the game world. The changing seasons add a dynamic element to the environment, affecting not only the aesthetics but also the driving dynamics. Racing through the same route in different seasons provides a refreshing and varied experience, as snow, rain, and sunshine each impact the handling of vehicles in distinct ways.

The vehicle roster in Forza Horizon 4 is extensive and diverse, featuring a wide array of cars from various manufacturers spanning different eras. Whether you're a fan of classic muscle cars, sleek supercars, or off-road beasts, there's something for everyone. The attention to detail in the car models is outstanding, with realistic interiors and authentic engine sounds that enhance the overall immersion.

The gameplay mechanics are accessible to both casual players and hardcore racing enthusiasts. The handling of cars strikes a good balance between realism and fun, making it easy for newcomers to pick up and play, while still offering depth for those seeking a more realistic driving experience. The open-world setting encourages exploration, and there are numerous events and challenges scattered throughout the map, ensuring that players always have something to do.

Forza Horizon 4's multiplayer component adds another layer of excitement to the experience. The seamless integration of online features allows players to seamlessly transition between solo and multiplayer modes, and the shared world creates a dynamic environment where other players can appear in your game at any time. The Horizon Life system ties together single-player and multiplayer progression, offering a cohesive experience as you level up and unlock new content.

The graphics in Forza Horizon 4 are nothing short of spectacular. The level of detail in the environments, the realistic lighting, and the weather effects contribute to a visually stunning racing experience. Whether you're racing through a forest in autumn or navigating snowy roads in winter, the visuals never fail to impress.

The soundtrack is another standout element, featuring a diverse selection of music that caters to different tastes. The radio stations offer a mix of genres, and the ability to create a custom playlist from your own music library adds a personal touch to the audio experience.

In conclusion, Forza Horizon 4 is a masterpiece in the racing genre. Its attention to detail, stunning visuals, diverse vehicle roster, dynamic weather system, and engaging gameplay make it a must-play for any racing game enthusiast. Whether you're a casual player looking for fun or a dedicated racer seeking a realistic driving experience, Forza Horizon 4 delivers on all fronts, solidifying its place as one of the best open-world racing games to date.",1707019800,1707019800,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If the driving is so good then why the not recommended mark? 
Because of all the things besides the driving... To game suffers from strange design decisions and some unfixed bugs. And most of all, it wastes your time on (a lot of) unnecessary stuff. 
Putting it into simple points:
1. The game has a lot of unskippable cutscenes, some that introduce the background ""story"" (if you can even call it that), some that just show new available events on the map (which are mostly just talking over a static image of the map). Moreover, some of these cutscenes are ads for the DLC, which last quite a while. 
2. Time wasting mechanics: to name the most annoying one - the fast travel. What do you mean, isn't it supposed to save you time? It is, but at first it is limited to only a few spots, and it costs more than you earn  for a single race... You can lower the cost of it to 0 if you find all the travel boards, but searching them up (looking up the location on the internet) takes around 3 hours of just that :\ 
3. Unnecessary bloat: in this game you have your own character, for which you can buy clothes, gestures etc. I wouldn't mind that, but it feels like the game is flooding you with this stuff instead of giving you rewards that really matter (like new cars). 
4. A lot of the better rewards come from gacha mechanics. 
5. Annoying bugs: The most frequent one is the map not displaying some of the icons after some new events are being introduced, which does not improve till you restart the game. 
6. Rewards from races are unsatisfying - maybe it's because of me being at the early stages of the game, but the races usually give between 6-12 thousand CR, with some cars and houses going for millions. If they do not improve with time, the grind to get them will be excruciating. (you can boost the rewards slightly by increasing the difficulty, but it is % based, so can't expect much)
7. Heavy pushing monetization - with not only DLC cars (which I am actually ok with), but for example the map marking all the boards to collect. Just why?

The core gameplay is great, but all the bloat and bad rewards structure do not make me want to play this game more. I will give it another few hours, but at this point I am wondering if it will be worth it.

""It's up and working again!""

If you are on AMD, and the program stops working/starts memory leaking; go to your root FH4 folder and delete ""TargetHardwareProfiler.dll"". After that's deleted, the game should work again as normal.

This game goes beyond what its mainstay console competitors have. Games like Need For Speed have their place here too, but the newer games feel far more limited in their options. FH4 has a much larger list of cars, some of which have been ported and touched up from previous games. The large multiplayer open world ensures you'll pass by some players. Cars have liveries, which means you can get pretty close to some real life car paint jobs or even make your own. The four seasons can be finicky for some, but personally I think this works out. The only real inconvenience with seasons is Winter, but you just need to slap on some Winter tires and you'll be fine. Regardless, I highly recommend to people who enjoy just driving around big areas. England is pretty cool too, I guess.",1685165664,1706761482,True,0,0,0.672527611255645752,0,True,False,False

Yes I struggle with words when I am expressing myself. 
Let me try. My love affair with Forza Horizon started back when they were doing cool stuff in Australia, FH 3. 
I bought that directly from Microsoft store. Since its a pain to install directly cause I often forget passwords, 
I bought this FH 4 UK from Steam. 
And I have been having a BLAST! FH3 is harder, its got weird driving Physics compared to this, but FH4 has best balance IMHO. FH5 is too easy? its got more grip and you just put on Power mods and go FAST! the map is boring. This map is gorgeous. its got corners and corners and corners. And the cars are really well done IMHO. So please do yourself a favor and get this and enjoy it for as long as the servers are still up. 
Yes I know my word salad is possibly too late, people may have already moved on, the world is waiting for a new Horizon DIG with not as much abated breathe since FH 5 was ummmm recycled crabs basically.

[i] At the time of writing the review, there were only 5 parts [/i]

Recommended for everyone who misses the old days of NFS and those who are not familiar with racing games, but want to give it a try. This game is exactly what a real racing game should be and will bring pleasure to both professionals and hoary racers as well as beginners who are afraid that they will not be able to compete in the race.

Good control, intuitive behavior of the car (exactly what you expect happens), an open world (which can be rammed or destroyed almost entirely and nothing will stop you. almost...), variable tuning of the car (both appearance and performance) graphics and optimization, what else is needed for a perfect racing game.

Also, multiplayer (to ride with friends or with strangers), constant events every week with cool rewards, roulette for which you don't have to pay, just play and win new cars and other great prizes.

And, of course, the change of season, which changes the game beyond recognition.

[h2]10/10 [/h2]

I took the time to learn to love the game but there is always something that triggers me every single time I play the game. First off the menu selection, to put it simply, it's confusing. It could have just been a simple selection like a list style menu without having to memorize everything due to the fact that its squares in each tab, and each time you select a square you get another screen menu which has a bunch of squares again making it really visually difficult and confusing. Same thing applies when you try to join races online, I'm aware there are not many players in this game compared to when it came out but why can't we have a open menu to see or filter lobbies created for a specific type of race rather than trying join randomly until getting the race you want, it's so frustrating, it's like the game was designed to be a headache. The only option you have is basically is to filter and search for races then good luck finding a race. The vinyl editor could have been way better considering the game has amazing graphics. Now with the tuning, I just wish there was more information that what you get from the tuning menu and telemetry, this would've made it easier to tune the cars rather than relying on a test drive every single time you make a setup change. Race physics seems funny except for when conditions are dry, in some cases like on a snowy or wet road, gravel or dirt you get pretty inconsistent results driving around the car, and I'm not talking about the conditions or terrain, it's the responsiveness of the car to that, now you can say that's exactly what it is but then what's the point of tuning? There are a variety of events to choose from but it doesn't feel like there's enough street and road racing events, after completing The Marathon and (I think)The Gauntlet I was left unsatisfied looking for more. Maybe it's just my expectations getting in the way of me enjoying the game, but I just really can't see it that way.",1706173312,1706173312,False,0,0,0.459770113229751587,0,True,False,False

I have since gotten a new ""supported"" wheel that still doesn't function correctly, refuses to bind my handbrake, and the FFB is still broken. I've since tried it on a buddy's system with the Windows Store version and everything works fine. I'm now debating buying the MS version to have it at least be functional, but then I basically have to start the entire game over again since it won't transfer save data on the same account.

The worst Horizon, and wheel support is basically completely broken. It also doesn't do cross saves, despite being tied to the same MS account, so all of the previous progress I've made and paint schemes from old titles I just can't access, which is just... incredible really. It also frequently gets stuck in infinite load loops after restarting an event, and initial bootup can take longer than GTAV for no reason. Sometimes it's quick, sometimes it's minutes.

Not my choice of the Horizon games. As the series has gone on the maps have just gotten worse to actually drive on. Being that I don't own an Xbox, the only alternative is Horizon 3 which has been removed from sale, I was stuck with this. I don't know what possessed the team to think that Britain would be a good location for Horizon. It's the most boring map yet offering a vast landscape of mostly empty flower fields. It's by far the least diverse map and the only thought to be had about that is they added seasons, but 3 of 4 are just variations of textures and frequency of rain. No one likes winter. As time has gone on in the series the roads have gotten wider and straighter so the lower class cars are a snore to drive. Even some of the super cars can bring on a snore when you go flat out through 4 corners in a row with hardly any steering input.

The game also never shuts up. After just about every race you get inundated with heaps of characters taking control away from you for unskippable cutscenes or dialogue you don't care about. The game won't even let you actually mute them, or the radio to play your own music for that matter. I'm 17,5 hours in and it still feels like I'm in a tutorial. It's a racing game, it's not that complicated.

They also destroyed any sense of progression Within the first few hours you're swimming in multi-million dollar cars, playing the slot machines to win more... or maybe just some really dumb clothing and dances.

One of the biggest things to me is I'm a huge loser and have a toy steering wheel. Despite the fact that my wheel is officially supported, and the game also supports multiple USB devices, it didn't recognize my pedals. Turns out this is a day 1 issue they never fixed. This started a full 2 day long troubleshooting process of using third party apps, conversing with devs of said app, registry edits, testing, etc. I eventually got it ""working,"" but the FFB is so completely different from every other game with wheel support ever. That's not an exaggeration. The Crew has better wheel support than this, despite having much worse physics. There's a pretty huge deadzone in centering forces for the first ~90 degrees of rotation left and right, which is where 95% of your driving actually is, thus I can't tell what the car is doing or how much grip I have until it's gone and sliding. If I drive down the highway at 90mph, turn the wheel 90 left and let go, it just stays there. It doesn't even attempt to center. None of the FFB settings fix this, and I can't figure out if it's just me.
In an effort to play by their rules, I dug through my box o crap and got the cable to plug my pedals into my wheel base, which should've been officially supported. The brake and throttle pedal were switched, with the button bindings being non-existent or illogical. Even when I play by their rules it's broken. I feel like I should get a refund on principle, but there's no way Steam would let me now because I spent 2 days trying to troubleshoot it.",1625031158,1705778757,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has a bit of everything and the seasonal track changes are pretty cool too. I'm only a couple hours into it, but so far I'm digging the game. It definitely pats you on the head for almost everything you do while driving. ""Great burnout!""... ""Way to trash that fence"" (We know you meant to do that. Here's some points!!"") As with any driving game, it takes a couple trips around the track to get the feel for the driving attributes but is very forgiving on the KB. So far its run flawlessly, no issues at all. It's a different beast with a Wheel.

You do have to have a Microsoft login account to even start the game unfortunately. I don't like that trend and I wished they'd stop doing that crap but they didn't bother me again once I remembered my Login and password.

As with any driving game, it takes a couple trips around the track to get the feel for the driving attributes.  KB controls are definitely doable, albeit a little soft and a tad sluggish but I guess that's to be expected. Each car I've driven so far, feels different to dive, as it should be. I knew cornering was going to be a challenge with my meaty Dodge Charger but i'm an old school racer that likes to catch those rice burners on the straightaways. Works great with my Logitech wheel and pedal setup.
  
Visuals are pretty good. I can run the game in ultra with my AMD Ryzen7 5800X and  8MB NVIDIA RTX3060Ti GPU.
The game starts with a very nice bench test if you want too. 

Music is OK for an hour or so. After that, I turned it down and streamed my own playlist. (ACDC and some Nugent BTW) 

I LOVE Anna's GPS directions. Haven't heard her in an actual race yet but its nice getting to the next race or influence spot anyway.

I'm new to the Forza franchise and started with the Ultimate Edition so I can't comment on how the standard version is but from reading others reviews, I feel the Ultimate edition is a really great deal right now for $40, especially when everyone else is asking $70 to start for any of the other top titles that have less content but more issues and more panhandling.
So far, if there has been any additional asking for cash in the Ultimate edition, I haven't noticed it yet. While its not for me, as long as I'm not forced to watch ""Buy our Monopoly money with your real money ads"", or can easily bypass it, I can live with it being there.

All in all, I'd give it an 8 of 10. My wheel likes to startup in reverse on this game lately and I can't find a way to reverse it in the settings (Terrible GUI BTW). I'm not sure what this is but I'll let you know if I find out what's going on.",1703185067,1705589373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lacking some of the customization that the NFS series has, Forza makes up with its sheer amount of cars. This is also one of, if not the, most beautiful games I have ever played. Cars feel good to drive (when you have them spec'd into grip and have stability turned on). All this said, there is plenty to do in this game, but it does get stale after awhile. I am 50 hours in, I have cleared all the actual races, but have barely touched the ""story"" (job) missions. I find them just... Kinda boring? I have certainly got my moneys worth from this game, but I couldn't recommend buying at full price. Also, unless you are just a completionist or a fan of a certain car, none of the dlc is worth buying aside from the map add-on.

Edit: So, while I do still love this game, and sunk even more hours into it trying to, finally, do the story/job missions as well as some of the dlc, it has come to my attention that there is a glitch where you will sometimes not get your seasonal rewards for hitting certain percentiles. This has been a glitch for some time, and with Motorsport just releasing a little while ago, not counting Horizon 5, I doubt it will ever be fixed. This realization does negatively effect my outlook on Horizon 4, and with nothing left to do but to drive around in my collection of, albeit, cool cars, with the seasonal grind being rendered potentially pointless, I believe I have no other choice than to finally close the door on this great game.",1650823658,1705370740,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It seems like a common problem with the Steam version for some reason cause I found a lot of forums that were having the same issues I had. At first, the game wouldn’t even open, it would just appear running on Steam and through the task manager. And then, it suddenly crashed along with Steam. It took me several tries and redownloads to get it to run properly. Thankfully, it started to run when I uninstalled (with the amd utility cleanup on safe mode) and reinstalled my amd drivers. I made sure everything was updated before downloading it again as well. I also disabled overlay from other apps (i.e., discord and xbox game bar) for smoother fps.

I still highly recommend this game despite all the tweaking and troubleshooting I went through.

Well, for me, it's a good game. Even if I discover some of the cars that were absent in Horizon 5, I decide to make discoveries on a legacy game. I probably don't know what else to think, as Horizon 4 is outdated since that one last update when they added the VUHL. 

Its seasons are very well-defined for the atmosphere visuals, I think Winter is the most obvious change in the environment. And the game's map is decent enough. Even if we think FH5 gets a bigger map, it's probably not that big enough tbh. After roaming around for a long time, the map feels small already. XD

Therefore, I believe that FH4 and FH5 are equal to me. I eventually trust a game that has a lot of cars to drive, but I guess the devs would mind adding some cars from THIS to FH5 in later updates. It always happens, one way or another.

Having purchased nearly every DLC, I can confidently say that each one is worth the bought, except for one—Lego Speed Champions. Despite my initial optimism upon buying it, this DLC turned out to be disappointingly dull. I'm an avid fan of Lego games, as evident in my library, but this particular DLC fell short.

I have a major issue. I can't play this game because I wasn't able to sign in. Nor was I able to get ANY support from the following companies/parties:
- Xbox
- Microsoft
- Forza
- Steam

My signing in problem was as follows:
I accidentally had a typo in the email address, ExampleEmailAddress.come (the ""e"" in .com), which made the email non-existent. I read a sentence that says ""Typo in your email address? Fix it here"" and where it says ""Fix it here"" is a link which doesn't work as instead of allowing me to fix the typo, instead it takes me back to the game and says ""Sign in needed"". But I can't sign in due to the typo. 
Like I said earlier, I have tried talking to those people about my problem and I didn't get any help besides the usual;

""You should contact XBOX/Microsoft or Steam.
Player Report: https://support.xbox.com/help/family-online-safety/enforcement/file-a-complaint
XBOX: http://support.xbox.com
WINDOWS: https://support.microsoft.com
Steam: https://help.steampowered.com"". 
Even though I did send a video with the report showing what the problem is, after I request for help after I realise I can't get a refund as I was too late. They continue to say; 

""The Forza Support and Safety team assists with in-game issues. We take a look at the issue you are reporting, try to reproduce it, bug it and then report it to the developers so they can investigate.

You should contact XBOX/Microsoft or Steam support regarding the following issues:

Issues with XBOX Live or Matchmaking
Issues with Party Chat or Game Invites
Issues with Player Harassment or Abuse
Issues with Purchases and Refunds
Issues with Store Downloads and Updates""

I even tried talking to Forza support on Discord directly, and still nothing. Wasted Money just because of a simple typo :(

Buuuuuut the Steam version has a little problem that can occur when you buy the game. Online features might not work at all. And this is very important, because people do interesting challenges and custom trials and tunes of you car that give you a better experience and make cars drive better.

Soooo... I did a Teredo fix and other stuff, but nothing worked for me. I have FH4 on Game Pass, so I decided to check whether it would work there and... EVERYTHING WORKS (with no Firewall)! It's interesting, because FH5 works like magic on the same Steam version with all online features.

So here is the best Drive Settings that I've found:
- Drivatar Difficulty: Pro or less
- Braking: ABS On
- Steering: Simulation
- Traction Control: Off
- Stability Control: Off
- Shifting: Automatic
- Driving Line: Breaking Only
- Damage and Tire Wear: Cosmetic
- Rewind: On

As a quick introduction to the game, Forza Motorsport is the original series of Forza games. The Motorsport series is based around closed circuit racing ie: racing at a race track. Forza Motorsport is essentially Xbox/Microsoft's equivalent to Playstation/Sony's sim racer, the Gran Turismo series. The big difference is, Forza then made the Horizon series. Horizon is open world and simcade, this to me is a major plus. Gran Turismo currently as far as I'm aware, does not have an open world experience like this.

The general premise of Horizon is that there is a festival called the Horizon Festival that is set in some part of the world, to celebrate car culture. Horizon 4 takes place in a fictionalized UK, borrowing some real world locations/landmarks, and just mashing it all into one island.

The biggest plus with Horizon 4 is that it has all proper 4 seasons unlike you weirdos who live near the equator and don't experience snowy winters. Unlike Horizon 5 which takes place in Mexico, Horizon 4 has summer which is what you'd expect from summer, spring which is nice green scenery with loads of rain (typical UK?), autumn which is more rain, less green, more yellow and leaves, and finally...winter. Actual snow. Something that I never thought of as rare because I live in Canada, but to some of you who live in parts of the world with no snow, well....welcome to actual winter. Sadly it is the least active season because apparently all of you are scared of a little bit of snow, but this is currently the only Horizon game with all four seasons. Winter in Horizon 5 is NOT winter. If there is no snow, it is not winter. Simple. Sorry, not sorry. Every week is a season change, with that comes new (at this point its recycled) content. If only winter lasted for 7 days...unlike the miserable Canadian winters.

Overall the gameplay is fine, you can tune the difficulty to your liking against the Drivatars (AI racers using player names) which only affects how much money you earn so you don't always have to feel frustrated with Unbeatable Drivatars especially since the AI is notorious for defying physics despite driving lesser or seemingly equivalent cars than yours. My favourite is online. When in freeroam online, all players are ghosted, this way you can't be trolled while freeroaming (or if you're AFK) unless you convoy up with friends or invite people to it. However that only applies to Freeroam or Forzathon Lives. Collision is turned on when you actually do races and events or as mentioned above with a convoy.

I mentioned Forzathon Live, what is that? Honestly one of my favourite things in this game. Every day, every hour, there is a Forzathon Live, every 50 minutes, a giant pink circle is placed on the map, you and all the people who want to participate, drive to the circle, after a 10 minute timer (the game notifies you at the 5-6min mark and another notification for two minutes after it starts), Forzathon Live begins, you and all the players now drive to an area, and as a team, complete a common goal. For example, try and get a total speed of 10,000mph. How does this work? Well, there is a speed camera here, drive by it as fast as you can, you and all the participants need to do this until you reach 10,000mph. It sounds tough at first but with enough people and the right cars and strategy, its easy and fun. Meet new people, see cool cars, have fun driving in a non-competitive environment just doing car stuff. You do three rounds of this, and when you finish, you all get Forzathon points. 10, 20, 30 depending on how many rounds you manage to complete with the team, you get 20, 40, or 60 points if you have a specific house or VIP (which gives this house to you for free). These points can be used to buy rare cars in the Forzathon shop amongst other things. Always fun to do, non-competitive so you don't need to deal with sweaty tryhards, just have fun with the team, then once its over (either you guys completed it or you failed, no big deal either way) you all disperse and you can resume with whatever you were doing before.

Overall this is a great game, yes there are known issues with the game like not being able to get 100% seasonal completion amongst other things unfortunately, no game is perfect, but compared to Horizon 5, this game is still very good. Remember, Horizon 5 takes place in Mexico, the winter in that game? What winter? There is no snow on most of the map. Also the car list is slightly different, some cars in this game might not be in FH5 so this is important to note. Overall I would say its a solid 8.5/10 for me. I don't feel like writing anymore since I normally write long ass reviews anyways. If you're wondering which edition to buy, personally I recommend Ultimate, it includes ALMOST all DLCs. The only things you miss are the Hot Wheels car pack (you need it in order to buy those cars in-game, but they can be driven in custom made challenge cards), Treasure Map (unlocks all map stuff, not really important), and I think the Mitsubishi pack which is free. There is also two additional Free DLCs but they're hard to find unfortunately (check or ask in Steam discussions). Either way I would recommend Ultimate for all the DLCs as you CAN'T buy the DLC cars from the Autoshow, and apparently not even the auction house unless you own said DLCs.

Final Note: Since the licensing for some of the cars in this game are almost expired, unfortunately this game will be delisted from Steam at some point, when, I don't know as its still unconfirmed and its also the first Forza game on Steam. This could be your last chance to experience Horizon 4 and what it has to offer before its gone and you only have Horizon 5 which won't have a true winter experience amongst other things that Horizon 4 has, so if you see it on sale, grab Ultimate Edition if you can.",1655455185,1704606268,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Performance and Optimization[/h1]
FH4 also has the absolute [b][i]best [/i][/b]optimization I have ever seen in a game. With my mid tier PC on a 5400RPM External HDD, I was very surprised to see I was running at a steady 60fps on 4k with most graphic settings turned to ultra. It's absolute wizardry what Playground Games did here.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The vehicles feel absolutely amazing. They're not super arcade-like and it feels like you're [i]actually[/i] driving a car that has weight to it. Customization of a car's parts even affects the car's performance which is [b]brilliant[/b] and an absolutely underrated feature.


There's an absolute [b][i]colossal[/i][/b] list of cars as well from [i]so[/i] many different manufacturers. The vehicle catalogue isn't [i]just[/i] your standard list of manufacturers that typically come with these Racing Games but includes many makes that I didn't even know existed. The [b][i]only[/i] problem[/b] that comes with such a big catalogue of cars is... looking through your garage can become overwhelming and you can easily lose, or forget, what car is for what type of content... The amount of times I've accidentally brought my drift car into a street race is ridiculous.




[h1]General Complaints[/h1]
Some of my [i]only[/i] complaints I have with this game is;
[list]
[*]Multiplayer (more specifically Online Adventure races) tend to break occasionally with a seemingly infinite loading screen. (Upwards of 7 minutes loading the next race)
[*]Character Customization is limited by an RNG Wheelspin for [i]almost[/i] all items. (ᴺᵒᵗᶦⁿᵍ: ᵂʰᵉᵉˡ ˢᵖᶦⁿˢ ᵃʳᵉ ᶠʳᵉᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ᵉᵃʳⁿᵃᵇˡᵉ ʷᶦᵗʰ ᶦⁿ⁻ᵍᵃᵐᵉ ᶜᵘʳʳᵉⁿᶜʸ. ᵀʰᵉʳᵉ ᵃʳᵉ ᵃᵇˢᵒˡᵘᵗᵉˡʸ [b]ⁿᵒ[/b] [b]ᵐᶦᶜʳᵒᵗʳᵃⁿˢᵃᶜᵗᶦᵒⁿ[/b] ᶦⁿ ᵗʰᵉ ᵍᵃᵐᵉ)
[*]Some features are definitely geared towards kids with [i]very[/i] awkward-looking Fortnite Dances and [b][i]WAY[/i][/b] overly censored song lyrics.
[/list]


[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
After coming from The Crew 2, and being disappointed by Need For Speed's direction lately, I was absolutely amazed by this game's gameplay and I [i]absolutely[/i] recommend this game if you're a fan of racing games, especially if you've been playing open-world racing games for a while. [b][i]HOWEVER[/i][/b] buy this game on a sale. With Forza Horizon 5 being released with upgraded graphics and some more optimized gameplay features, this [b][i]isn't[/i][/b] worth the listed price of $60* for the base game anymore, [i]especially[/i] when it [b]reliably goes on sale[/b] every few months for $19.79* (though I would [b][i]definitely[/i][/b] recommend the Expansion Packs as well that come in the Ultimate Edition. UD has the same sale pattern and goes on sale for $34.99*).


I will also note, I've seen many players state they have problems with the steam version of this game. Personally, I've not run into any issues so far with crashing or not launching in my 100 hours of gameplay in my 2½ years of owning and playing this. Just be warned, it seems to be a hit or miss with [i]some[/i] people on being able to run this out-of-the-box.

Forza Horizon 4 has undeniably claimed its spot on my top ten games list, and it's not hard to see why. This game is a racing masterpiece that combines stunning visuals, a vast open-world playground, and an unrivaled attention to detail that sets it apart from the competition.

Let's start with the visuals - they're nothing short of breathtaking. The dynamic weather system and the changing seasons add a level of realism that I've never experienced in a racing game before. The way the autumn leaves fall or the winter snow blankets the landscape is not only visually stunning but also affects the gameplay, making each race a unique and immersive experience.

The open-world design of Forza Horizon 4 is a true highlight. The map is a seamless blend of picturesque landscapes, from the city streets of Edinburgh to the scenic countryside of the Lake District. The diversity in terrain keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting, and there's always a new route or hidden spot to discover. The attention to detail in recreating a condensed, yet authentic, representation of Great Britain is commendable.

One of the aspects that truly sets Forza Horizon 4 apart is the car lineup. The roster is diverse, ranging from classic vintage cars to cutting-edge supercars, and everything in between. The level of customization available is staggering, allowing you to personalize every aspect of your ride to match your style. The sheer number of cars and the attention to detail in their design and handling make the racing experience incredibly immersive.

The gameplay is accessible to all skill levels, thanks to the various difficulty settings and assists. Whether you're a casual player looking for a relaxing drive through the countryside or a hardcore racer seeking a challenging competition, Forza Horizon 4 caters to everyone. The integration of a shared open-world with real players seamlessly adds an extra layer of excitement to races, creating a living, breathing online community.

The soundtrack deserves a special mention. The selection of music is eclectic, fitting various moods and creating an immersive atmosphere. The attention to detail in synchronizing the soundtrack with the dynamic weather and time of day adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the overall experience.

In conclusion, Forza Horizon 4 has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It's a game that not only looks and feels amazing but also offers an unparalleled level of freedom and enjoyment. Playground Games has created a racing paradise that continues to captivate and entertain, earning its well-deserved spot on my top ten games list. If you have even the slightest interest in racing games, do yourself a favor and give Forza Horizon 4 a try – you won't be disappointed!",1704531364,1704531364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

How hard is it to make a game about CARS and DRIVING run on most Windows boxes with good hardware?
To have released this in 2021 and have an issue like this? 
I'm sure that if this garbage had been released before Steam offered refunds, this lovely triple-A quality would be the greatest motivator, since, if you look on the forums, loads of people have this issue.
I know the game is probably fun and good... but this is actually heinous. 
Like, I gave you money and want to play your game. It's not even about the money. If you make a game, you probably want people to play it, right? That's why you're selling it? So people can play it? Isn't there multiplayer in this game? I wouldn't know, because it's so great it can't launch.
Your game is so 'good' that people who want to play it are unable to. The people who should be able to, especially those who not only meet but exceed the recommended hardware requirements, are not, because of how great it is. 
I decided to buy this game because Forza Horizon 5 requires a Microsoft account, and I'm not about to do that.
It looks like this game is just as good. They did a good job. A great job.

There are no individual tracks, just a giant open world and so whatever race you are in, it kind of looks the same.

Online mode doesn't really work. Most of the online games just involve racing against ghosts (the other players drive right through you) and so there's no fun to it at all. Not to mention that I lost every race within seconds, because I hadn't invested how ever many hours you need to invest into configuring my car and upgrading it. Would be nice if they had online races where all the players have the same car, but I think they either removed that feature or it's unavailable because not enough people want to do it.

The game tries to sell you stuff. You'll see something interesting on the map. Drive all the way there. Then a screen comes up asking you for money to access it. Real life money that is.

Like what the others have said, it's better than FH5. The seasons that they implemented certainly makes it feel more dynamic and cared for compared to FH5. It's just super fun driving a Quattro around dirt roads and drifting like you own the place. The AI is pretty decent although I noticed that once you overtake them, they literally just give up and let go of the throttle, taking away the challenge of staying ahead. The characters are kinda cringe but still beyond okay. The driving here is more arcade-y so if you're looking for something more realistic, it's best to look at your options.

[h1] Steering Wheel Compatibility Nightmare [/h1]

Using a Logitech G290 steering wheel on this game is a pain in the ass, the steering is not aligned, turning is a nightmare with the sensitivity either being too much or too less and the centering spring being very loose.

As somebody that generally despises Microsoft, this game studio is probably the best thing they have. Nowhere else can you have so much fun driving a retro Ferrari through fields and forests. I must have killed hundreds in head on crashes, and it's possible my real life driving habits have been affected, but overall the game is worth every penny. The best of the genre by a mile, and it's starting to replace boring sims with bad progression like GT7 for me personally. 

Graphics still looks fantastic on Extreme with a good PC, but they also run really well and there are no major issues outside the odd crash that rarely happens. 4K native looks really good, and the only slight drawback is some thankfully slight LOD pop-in here and there, as well cascading water reflections, but they are relatively minor all things considered.

Loads of stuff to do. Online was busy and functioning for me. No issues there. I highly recommend the Ultimate edition on sale.

After experiencing most of the content that can unlock achievements, I have organized some notes for non professionals, for reference only. First of all, the conclusion is that the game is worth playing, but it is not recommended to blindly follow the trend.
The absolute value of game quality is 4 stars, and the deduction of 1 star is due to poor online content experience and some achievements that are too outrageous. Check ""not recommended"" because the Steam version has the problem of cutting corners and there are too many useless fake likes and bad reviews!
Advantages: First rate image quality, a masterpiece in photography. Excellent music with numerous divine songs. Optimization is very good. There are many details, dust, soil, and snow can splash on the car, and their distribution in different areas will also change over time. Rainbows appear after rain, snowmen build on the roadside in winter, and fireworks are set off at night in the main camp. The competition part was very enjoyable, especially as I watched myself being bullied from the beginning to gradually challenging higher-level AI and leaving them behind. At the same time, I also had leisure to enjoy the scenery. If I could come across beautiful songs, it would be even more wonderful. The day and night weather season system is complete, and there is no shortage of drifting, speed measurement, and long jump that racing games should have. There is also a variety of multi-purpose vehicles for multi terrain competitions. Wealth Island DLC is very exciting. Lego DLC God of the Gods.
Disadvantages, to be honest, unfortunately, the biggest drawback is that I found myself not enjoying the racing theme and many of its fixed gameplay. I came to play this game from Ubisoft Extreme Country's hundreds of hour retreat pit. I thought I would like it because it's all about racing, but the problem is here. I only enjoy playing the content of racing races, and I can't enjoy the rest of the racing themed content. Horizon 4 is a game that completely revolves around racing, with many gameplay and content that are very addictive. Racing is only a small part of it, and it is even different from the Need for Speed series that I had a great time playing with. Due to the elements of police and bandit confrontation, Need for Speed is still a racing part, which accounts for a considerable proportion compared to other content. On the contrary, Horizon 4 weakens the proportion of racing content, I have done too much tedious numerical challenge content, and the focus is clearly more on the online multiplayer part and high-quality model performance. Coincidentally, these are not the contents that I care about. In fact, by the time I played the game for half an hour, I had already felt bored and felt that the content was highly repetitive and scattered. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a refund for the key I bought. I thought I could play it as an achievement driven game, but in the end, the difficulty of my achievements successfully persuaded me to quit
Also, because I came from an extreme country, I would unconsciously compare myself during the gameplay. I often feel that there is no special design in Extreme Land, and playing with Horizon has become an advantage. Of course, if you play it yourself, there may not be such a gap. I didn't mean to use Extreme Land to step on the horizon, but I found that one of these games focuses more on racing, while the other revolves entirely around racing themes. Writing them down in detail in the following text may help many people like me figure out what kind of game they need, so that they don't realize it's not suitable for them after playing. Another thing is that many of the functional designs of Horizon may be constrained by the times, resulting in a less enjoyable experience than subsequent works. I will also compile these. Just to emphasize, although the following text is quite lengthy, there are no drawbacks to the game that would make it completely impossible to play. Overall, I still recommend the game (worth playing).",1669168615,1704100772,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, this game is fun with a lot of different free-roam mechanics to keep you busy.  The cars look pretty good, but not exactly Gran Turismo level of eye-popping realism (car  interiors look like they textures havent rendered). There are lots  of vehicles and tuning options and plenty of races, stunts, and off-beat levels like the Top Gear missions. 

Where this game falters is the endless stream of microtransactions they shove in your face. In between seasons there is a non-skippable video about all the DLC you are missing out on.  I've seen the video twice in 10 gameplay hours. 
The vehicle roster looks large from the outset, but at least half of the cars are locked behind pay-walls. Additionally there are DLC items on the maps at all times trying to lure you into paying another $20--$40 on top of the regular game to enjoy legoland. 

This is my first Forza game, but I dont think I will come back to the franchise anytime soon.  The microtransactions do not add to the game, they ARE the game. I dont even feel comfortable letting my kids play it since the Mtx comes up so often I'm sure they will buy uselsss add-ons by accident.

Released in 2018, the game has captivated players with its stunning visuals, realistic driving mechanics, expansive open-world environment, and an array of vehicles that span the automotive spectrum. In this essay, we will delve into the various aspects that make Forza Horizon 4 a standout title and why it has earned its reputation as one of the finest racing games of its time.

Visual Marvel:

One of the first things that strike players when they launch Forza Horizon 4 is its breathtaking visuals. The game is a visual marvel, boasting a meticulously crafted open-world environment set in the picturesque landscapes of Great Britain. The attention to detail is unparalleled, with each season – spring, summer, autumn, and winter – bringing a distinct and immersive aesthetic to the game. Whether it's the vibrant colors of autumn leaves or the serene beauty of a snowy winter landscape, Forza Horizon 4's graphics are a testament to the capabilities of modern gaming technology.

The realism extends beyond the environment to the cars themselves. Each vehicle is meticulously rendered, showcasing the intricate details of their design, from the gleaming curves of a luxury sports car to the rugged exterior of an off-road vehicle. The dynamic weather system further enhances the visual experience, as raindrops bead on windshields and snow accumulates on the road, affecting the handling of vehicles. The visual fidelity of Forza Horizon 4 is not just eye candy; it plays a crucial role in immersing players in the virtual racing experience.

Realistic Driving Mechanics:

Forza Horizon 4 strikes a delicate balance between realism and accessibility in its driving mechanics. The game offers a diverse range of cars, each with its own unique handling characteristics that reflect their real-world counterparts. Whether you're tearing through the countryside in a high-performance supercar or navigating tight city streets in a compact hatchback, the responsiveness of the controls and the physics engine make every vehicle feel distinct and authentic.

The realism is enhanced by the game's attention to detail in terms of tire grip, suspension dynamics, and vehicle weight. Players can feel the difference between driving on wet and dry surfaces, and the changing weather conditions add an extra layer of challenge to the driving experience. Despite the authenticity, Forza Horizon 4 remains accessible to players of varying skill levels, thanks to adjustable difficulty settings and a range of driving assists that can be tailored to individual preferences.

Open-World Exploration:

Forza Horizon 4's open-world environment is a sprawling playground for automotive enthusiasts. The map, a condensed but faithful representation of Great Britain, offers a diverse range of terrains, from the bustling streets of Edinburgh to the winding roads of the Lake District. The seamless transition between seasons not only affects the visual landscape but also transforms the driving experience. Lakes freeze over in winter, opening up new routes, and spring brings vibrant foliage that enhances the overall aesthetics of the game.

The open-world design encourages exploration, with hidden barn finds, stunt jumps, and races scattered across the map. The sense of freedom is amplified by the absence of traditional race tracks, allowing players to chart their own course through the picturesque landscapes. The ability to seamlessly transition between solo and online play further adds to the dynamic nature of Forza Horizon 4, as players can engage in cooperative races, competitive events, or simply cruise around the open world with friends.

A Plethora of Vehicles:

Forza Horizon 4 boasts an extensive and diverse roster of over 700 vehicles, ranging from classic cars to modern hypercars and everything in between. The meticulous attention to detail extends to each vehicle's sound design, ensuring that the roar of a V8 engine or the whine of an electric motor is faithfully reproduced. The cars are not merely cosmetic additions; they are integral to the gameplay experience, each offering a unique driving feel that caters to different preferences.

The game's deep customization options allow players to personalize their vehicles, from performance upgrades to cosmetic modifications. Whether you're a gearhead fine-tuning every aspect of your car's performance or a casual player looking to express your creativity through unique paint jobs and decals, Forza Horizon 4 accommodates a wide spectrum of player preferences.

Dynamic Multiplayer Experience:

Forza Horizon 4 seamlessly integrates multiplayer elements into its open-world design. The game features a shared online world where players from around the globe can coexist, participate in events, and engage in spontaneous races. The dynamic nature of the open world ensures that each session feels alive, with real-time events and challenges that can be tackled solo or cooperatively with other players.

The competitive aspect of Forza Horizon 4 is realized through its ranked multiplayer modes, where players can test their skills against others in a variety of race types. The ranking system ensures a fair matchmaking experience, pitting players of similar skill levels against each other for a competitive and satisfying multiplayer experience.

Conclusion:

Forza Horizon 4 is not merely a racing game; it is a symphony of sight, sound, and sensation that combines to create an unparalleled gaming experience. Its stunning visuals, realistic driving mechanics, expansive open-world environment, diverse vehicle roster, and dynamic multiplayer features collectively contribute to its status as a masterpiece in the racing game genre. As players immerse themselves in the virtual world of Forza Horizon 4, they are not just racing cars; they are experiencing the culmination of gaming technology, attention to detail, and a deep passion for the art of automotive excitement.

Forza Horizon 4 is a good car driving game to suggest with various singleplayer contents to spend time alone. Many contents of the game makes you to mostly enjoy discovering the world and running races as co-op instead of competitive racing against other players, which makes this game very friendly to beginners who are simply want to try driving games. You can enjoy beautiful open world that has changing season/weather which allows you to have different experience every race or week. Soundtracks for the game are mostly very good too. There is no doubt about recommending this game to anyone willing to give a try, but here are some concerning things about the game if you are hesitating:

Although this game is very chill driving game to enjoy as a beginner, the game is definitely not meeting players' expectation who would want to see less stressful racing simulation that happens in anywhere in the world. While the game feels a bit harder than casual racing, ultimately it feels very close to arcade rather than open world sim racing, which it seems like making the game to be in weird position to target neither groups of players and even possibly be somewhat challenging.

Also, forced weekly season can heavily affect your singleplayer experience. Usually the season doesn't bother you too much while you simply try to participate event races where it lets you to choose own cars with proper tuning, and where you can change conditions as well. But when it comes to clearing many chapter missions that asks you come into finishing point by very sharp time, it gets nearly impossible if you can't take any shortcuts yet the weather is winter, while forcing you to use cars that are not prepared for such weather conditions. Because you can't change weather other than temporary custom racing event, it gets really annoying rather than feeling immersive driving experience.

The only reason why I would not pay for full price is because the game has so many minor bugs that players have to figure out and manually handle how to deal with them. This game has been out for about 5 years, and yet you still don't see the developers actively handling frequent issues that hinders your overall experience.",1703793769,1703793919,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Seriously good game, stunning graphics and cars are fabulous to see. The map is quite expansive. 
The only snag I had with this game is the dreaded ""LOW BANDWITH STREAMING"" which will halt your car mid race or speed and reset to 0, once the area has rendered in. It only usually happens above 150mph, and it's a bug in the game. I fixed mine by installing on my m.2 SSD and it works brilliantly now. I love this game and driving around the UK, I have lived near one of the places featured in Ambleside and it is very real indeed!!!

This game is amazing and I think that it is better than the xbox version of the game just because you can make the graphics better than 1080p and that you can have the framerate higher than 60 fps if you have a powerful enough gaming PC to do that. Forza Horizon has shorter and faster races compared to the Forza Horizon games, but at least you do not have to worry about the seasons in the Forza Motorsport games.

TL;DR: If you want faster races and open world racing appeals to you more compared to longer races and private race track racing found in the Forza Motorsport games, then this game is for you.

Thought my graphics card broke but it turns out it's the game. Repaired it countless times and no luck. Any other game of mine launches. Once crash is fixed I'll recommend it again.]

[EDIT 2.0: After the new early May 2021 update my game still crashes after loading into the game. So I went to go look for the 'userdata' folder and manually removed all of my 'Saved Game' files and voila it's working again, but now I lost 30 hours of gameplay. Put the files back and the crashes roll in.] Also after restarting my new career about 5 hours in it's crashing again in the first loading screen.

Forza Horizon 4, a gem for sure but it does have some blemishes:

- Micro-stuttering, crashing, no save game transfer from Xbox App and some steam achievements don't unlock after achieving them. I have over 300 Hours in this game via the game pass. What a shame.

- Corrupted my save game files. If you like the risk of starting over after dodgy updates then you're looking at the best game for that.

[Edit 3.0] After about a year of leaving the game alone and on acquisition of a GPU with 4GB of video memory I am able to enjoy this game again. No corruption of save game files thus far, less micro-stuttering and an overall nice experience. I had some trouble with the Xbox app [which is necessary if you want to play FH4 online] but after a re-install of the Xbox App via the Website [not Microsoft Store - it doesn't work via that] I was able to connect the game again after Signing Out and Signing back into my Xbox Account via the FH4 Start Menu before loading the game. Still no save game sync from Xbox App but seems to sync progress via Steam Cloud just fine. Still crashes occasionally when entering houses which is annoying.

>>>2023 Updated EDIT 4.0: Crashes, Crashes, Crashes. Especially when playing with friends online, the more friends you invite the more the game crashes. Impossible to get 100% game completion at this time, achievements don't pop up properly, the loading times for Online Adventures are atrocious[You wait FOREVER to Find A Session]. Not worth the hassle I'm afraid if you like playing online and you are OCD on completing the game.

+ But if you can get past all of the negatives this game is probably one of the best racing games I've ever played, and I've played many since I started playing racing games back in 1999.

+ Loads of content! Like, really this game will keep you busy for months.

+ Can be played comfortably solo but I highly recommend doing all of the online adventures, especially ranked, because you'll be gifted a ton of stuff once the season is over!

+ The rewards system and game pacing is excellent, I don't get bored easily with this game (except if I need to delete my save game files due to updates corrupting my profile)

+ So many cool cars and childhood faves including [SPOILER ALERT!!!!!] go see for yourself :) over 700 cars!!

+ If you have the hardware, this game looks GORGEOUS!!

+ Can be played comfortably with a computer keyboard

+ Multiplayer with friends is a lot of fun

+ Sounds are pretty good but not the best (GRID & DIRT still rule here), love the soundtrack but it can become pretty repetitive. (Especially when re-doing your career because of corrupted save games............)

+ Large maps and cool expansion packs.

[Overall] Despite the tons of annoying bugs - this game is absolutely fantastic. I love cars and to be able to drive a bunch of legendary cars and upgrade them beyond recognition is a real treat. The career mode is brilliant and entertaining, the online challenges are tough but fun and very rewarding, when they work.",1615999123,1703780971,True,0,0,0.490196079015731812,0,True,False,False

What more could you want?

My complaints:
There are some stupid gimmicks. For example this ""Forzathon"" and ""Festival Playlist"" crap. To someone who's new to the series and hasn't already grown accustomed to it, these things just clutter the UI.
The UI is... a thing. It makes sense, for the most part. My problem is with having to be at a hub somewhere on the map to do upgrade or buy cars. This can be annoying when I just got decimated in a race and need to adjust my car but I have to travel across the map to do so. I can't just upgrade my vehicle right there at the race.
Buying houses does not make sense. You can fast travel to the Horizon Festival for free. So what's the point in purchasing a 3 million dollar house?
By far my biggest complaint is with the NPC drivers, referred to ""Drivatars"" in-game. They are constantly getting in the way. The devs obviously noticed this because they provided a few places in Forza 5 where you can just test drive cars without crashing into NPCs. Unfortunately, this is absent in Forza 4 where all the roads are quite heavily populated with Drivatars you're expected to dodge. This makes is inextricably difficult to hit top speed in the fastest vehicles.
A slight complaint is with the mods themselves. Apparently, it's rather easy to get banned for using money tricks. Which is stupid. Even EA has accepted that people cheat code Sims to beyond the point of recognition. Get with the times.",1703384368,1703384368,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Online often doesnt work. takes forever to load, if it loads at all. joining games, during events etc. ( you can let it load for 15mins, then maybe it joins if youre lucky or just alt+f4) 
- WHY CANT I MUTE PLAYERS? the only way to mute players is trough the menu MID RACE!?!!? causing a loss.

Forza Horizon 4 is a stellar racing game that not only excels in delivering a thrilling and immersive gaming experience but also stands out for its incredible realism. The attention to detail in recreating the environment, the cars, and the overall physics of the game is nothing short of impressive.

One of the standout features is the game's stunning graphics and lifelike landscapes. The open-world environment, set in a beautifully rendered version of Great Britain, is breathtaking. The changing seasons not only add visual diversity but also impact the gameplay, making the world dynamic and engaging.

The realism extends to the car models and their handling. Each car is meticulously recreated, capturing every detail, from the sleek curves to the manufacturer's emblem. The attention to detail also extends to the interior of the cars, allowing players to experience a sense of immersion as they navigate through the game.

What truly sets Forza Horizon 4 apart is the authenticity of its car sounds. The engine roars, tire screeches, and gear shifts are so realistic that they contribute significantly to the overall immersive experience. Whether you're tearing through the countryside or racing through urban streets, the audio design makes you feel like you're right there in the driver's seat.

The game's realistic physics add to the challenge and excitement. Weather conditions affect the road grip, and each car responds differently, providing a nuanced driving experience. This attention to realism doesn't compromise the fun factor; instead, it enhances it.

Forza Horizon 4's commitment to realism, coupled with its diverse and expansive gameplay, makes it a standout racing game. Whether you're a car enthusiast or simply enjoy a well-crafted game, Forza Horizon 4 delivers an unparalleled experience that is as close to the real thing as it gets in the world of gaming.",1703180766,1703180766,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's weird, fh5's map is beautiful in its own right but this just has some sort of magic to it, which is only enhanced by the seasons which i didn't originally like but I now love. Drifting on snowy roads feels so satisfying it's worth buying to experience that alone.

UPDATE 
************
OK ill admit this is one of my favorite  car games  but it really makes me work for it this game ran  flawlessly  on my new laptop i bought in October 2022   then recently forza announced that a gpu update  was available (march 2023) so i updated that is when my game started  freezing  so i preserve and   uninstalled  my gpu drivers  im running a i7  12th gen  with a RTX 3060  6 gig  after installing the newest  NVIDIA drivers and still getting the same freezing  i  went on the NVIDIA site to download older version of the drivers  ( google old NVIDIA drivers ) after trying several i found the studio drivers from  	October 18, 2022     version  	522.30   work and the freezing is gone now is it ideal no will i recommend  this game now  NO it has pis*ed me off  i shouldn't  have to  roll back my drivers  to play a triple A title but i still love  the game itself ...

more disappointment from Microsoft 
********************************
last night i was delighted to find that  i could play forza 4 and uncharted waters origin at the same time 
which is ideal you can race while u do trade routes . pretty sweet for any uwo nerds out there  cause u know how it goes .I played   both games all night and then the next  evening i come home from work and  forza 4 crashes every time i try to log on  both games  of course other titles like ride3  work  but forza doesn't  i suppose i should be used to this by now ...   its kinda of  like a bad dream i sometimes wonder if this sh*t is real ....

update

i have returned to try and play the game again and now i can not access the server   now after  reading my own review i figured out i had to log out of the server and log back in and now i can access online   games not worth playing if u cant get on the creative hub imo  PS SS    microsoft still wont let u run other games  while u play this  one  intill  they fix that ill never give this game a thumbs up  i know most of u play on potatoes but i dont and some times id like to play afk games and do races and unless i stream games on google   on other pcs i cant play other games while this title plays",1679105011,1702870157,False,7,0,0.57554316520690918,0,True,False,False

High, but you can lower the settings

DIFFICULTY
On a keyboard, it takes a while to master the controls, but on a controller, if you play often, it won't be a problem for you

- The Setting (Great Britain); however Edinburgh is super watered down!
- Changing of Seasons
- Racing Mechanics

- Graphics/Performance

Disliked:
- Xbox App Integration Mandatory (popups are so annoying!)
- Set pieces (showcases) are beautiful but feel so scripted
- The open world driving to races - just let me race!
- Story is pretty much non-existent (and I'm a single player gamer)
- To get more than 7ish hours out of the game, you have to be racing or collecting for their own sake and not for story purposes

Score: 6.5/10 - Would recommend the game if you love racing (particularly off-road racing) and can get it on sale, or if you love open-world online racing.

There was nearly 6 months of a major crash bug affecting Nvidia users, and now we're more than half a year into a bug where players just don't get rewards they've earned from weekly/monthly seasonal/series challenges, specifically the Horizon Backstage Passes.

These are essentially coupons players can redeem for very rare cars, except for many months now players haven't been receiving them, meaning that if you're trying to complete your car collection you basically cannot, because many of the Backstage cars cannot realistically be obtained any other way and are never on the auction house.

The devs have clearly stated that they know about the bug but that they have ""no plans"" to fix it because they're too busy working on FH5 (which just got new microtransactions that have upset the playerbase).

I'll happily change my review if and when this gets fixed, but currently the game owes me literally about two *dozen* backstage passes.

AT A MINIMUM, they should just start giving the players a free backstage pass every week to compensate for the bug they refuse to fix.",1672267520,1702432904,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Microsoft account
2. The inability to skip seasons (winter) is lame. I'm depressed by winter IRL; I don't want it in my escapism.
3. The fact that you have to install ""racing brakes"" on every individual car to adjust brake pressure is outright dumb, especially since the default of all cars is ""even a bit of brake is slamming the brakes"".
4. Championships that make you buy a new car all the time. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for point 3.

I bought the deluxe edition after the Steam release. I recommend taking it (especially on sale only for $30), because it contains many exclusive cars that perform well in their class. My impressions are amazing. It is very relaxing, will not let you get bored (many different races, network modes and more) and will not force you to farm on cars - they will ""accumulate"" in the garage themselves. I liked the physics - almost everything on the map is interactive; graphics and optimization at height; large car garage; change of seasons. There are also 2 DLC’s with original maps.

According to reviews, the edition in Steam is more buggy than in MS.
Very disappointed with the network mode with its bugs, 10-minute ""fast"" movement, departures from the network mode, issue that can’t connect to Xbox live servers... 

And if we talk about it.. why we need to connect our Steam account to Xbox account? Then what is the advantage of the fucking Steam version?

There is no simple chatting with others (because it’s olny 4 customized prepeared answers), no in-campaing team-racing (because it’s impossible to find just a 3-men race, I don’t know why). 

Game have a well music, but IT CAN’T BE fully turned off. It boring every time you have a race loading screen. The AI is bad, seriously, but only “drivatars”. NPC’s is also bad namely their animations and faces (it’s not a huge issue, it’s a racing game). From this we can understand that the game has a not-offensive kid friendly athmosphere and it is nasty.

In general offline game is pretty good, but online part not as good as we wanted. Devs not updating the game and don’t fixing this major issues they are engaged in disgusting FH5.",1640719375,1701605605,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

funny notion, PULSE RADIO is pure fire this time.
just a small note, while it runs well on almost anything, DON'T INSTALL IN ON HDD, get an SSD for this, also 16gb ram goes a long way, the game never skipped a not on my ancient rig thanks to an SSD and 16gb of ram.
while not as impressive as FH5, the low entry price and the fact that for a 2018, can still run with the best, is a testament of how good this game is.

The events are scattered about the map, but it all seemed so random, I can't tell any real purpose to playing.

Today when I played I got unskippable ads for DLC, and this was when I realized the sound was too high, but it wouldn't let me escape to the settings. I just took my headphones off at that point.

And they still put the events for DLC you don't have on your map. Went to one, just a link to the marketplace when I got there. I guess I'll drive to some other icon on the map and hope it's available to me....",1701560450,1701560450,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

The changing seasons keep things interesting, making every drive a new adventure. I love the huge variety of cars – from flashy sports cars to rugged off-roaders, there's something for every mood. The game's attention to detail is top-notch, with realistic engine sounds and screeching tires that make you feel like you're really in the driver's seat. Exploring the open world at my own pace is a joy, and jumping into multiplayer races with friends is seamless fun. Forza Horizon 4 is a must-play for any racing game fan!

The game's graphics are a standout feature, showcasing the capabilities of modern gaming technology. The level of detail in the cars, the realistic weather effects, and the seamless transition between seasons contribute to a visually breathtaking experience. Whether you're racing through the rain-soaked streets of Edinburgh or drifting on the icy roads in winter, Forza Horizon 4 delivers a visually diverse and engaging racing environment.

The handling and physics of the cars are finely tuned, striking a balance between realism and accessibility. Each vehicle feels unique, and the wide range of cars, from sleek sports cars to off-road vehicles, caters to a variety of racing preferences.

The customization options in Forza Horizon 4 are extensive, allowing players to personalize their cars to an impressive degree. (Scarily impressive!)

Forza Horizon 4 stands as a pinnacle in the racing game genre. Its stunning visuals, realistic driving mechanics, extensive car customization, and seamless integration of multiplayer elements make it a must-play for both racing enthusiasts and casual gamers alike.

But if you go beyond the developers idea of how the game should be played it really shows its flaws.
If you turn all of the assists off and play as realistically as possible, the game is much more fun to play with even greater rewards, but it completely breaks the AI. I've seen my own car get artificially slowed down and the AI get sped up far beyond their acceleration capabilities.
Even at the above average AI setting, which should be a completely reasonable difficulty, you have to drive dirty to finish 1st.
I can't even imagine playing this on the hardest difficulty, but at least the game is fun in one of tens of configurations.
Also, the forzathon and playlist series are a huge waste of time and prey upon gamers sense of FOMO.
It shows you years of updates and all of the stuff you've already missed out on, as well as push you to play challenges that are unfair and unfun.
If you want to play this game, you're better off doing it offline and just enjoying it at whatever difficulty you can tolerate.

Whilst I yearn for those arcade racers such as Need for Speed underground 2 and Most wanted which have hard earned progression with cars which you keep for hours on end slowly developing before investing in a better car, they simply do not exist anymore.

I don't recommend this game for anyone who loves feeling a sense of accomplishment. Its very very easy, even with the difficulty set high. Its forgiving, the obstacles melt like butter and don't slow you down, there are no penalties really for mistakes unless you hit a really big tree or a house. The story-line progression is so fast that you almost feel like you want to slow it down or raise the progression points, the in-game seasons and race championship tiers fly by before you've even started to experience them properly. Race entry limitations are pretty much non existent and you gain cars and money so quickly that nursing a particular car is unnecessary - if you find your current car lacking you can either max its upgrades out before a race or just buy another car if the game hasnt already given you a better one, the money you gain right off the bat is more than you'll ever need and buying the car pass cuts out the middle man here, it literally fills your garage and wallet up right from the start.

For some these things might be boring, and if i didnt have half a dozen sensible racing games I would mind. But I dont, its fun!! ^^

- The devs seems to have some weird idea that everyone likes to drive while listening music, so they don't give you option to disable it unless you turn off the entire game sound. After they spend so much time adding accessibility options they decided to force the distracting music covering the engine and the tires... Is the ego of whoever produced the soundtrack that big?

- [edit: this has now been fixed... I guess better late than never] but at the moment I cannot recommend it to anyone: It crashes every 5-10mins on both high and mid range hardware with the latest drivers and updates (tested on 12700k + 3080 12g and 1050ti). Sometimes I cannot even reach or finish a race and I'm back to my house. I can only hope that Playground games will fix. ]",1671306668,1701121502,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, it has beautiful graphics and good races and storyline, I also like the cars and sounds quite a lot as well as the detail on the inside of the car (you have screens that show your speed and sometimes radio inside the car like you would and it's as you would find it inside the car).

Now, why is the game better than FH5? I think its better because you have a more condensed map but also a more interesting map, FH5 feels empty with not much to do and the houses look awful in my opinion. The roads and scenery are boring as well. FH4 on top!

I played American Truck Simulator before, but it just focused on huge slow semi trucks, and I also played F1 2017 before, but it was just focused on the track and the track only. I wanted a game where I could just drive around a large map with a variety of sports cars and supercars, allowing for partial throttle/brake (controller needed) because nobody just floors it all the time when driving normally.

And that's what this game is. No story distracting myself from the gameplay. Racing events and challenges are there if I feel like it but almost never seem forced on you. Many difficulty options to choose from allowing for a nice casual race or a huge challenge.

BUT:  This game has unskippable video ads interrupting the gameplay. Yes, you heard me right. UNSKIPPABLE VIDEO ADS INTERRUPTING GAMEPLAY. This has only happened about 3 times so far, but rarely when you go into a loading screen, the game decides to BLAST a FULL-VOLUME ad for one of the expansion DLCs. This ad is unskippable and lasts TWO MINUTES. Completely unacceptable. Not buying any DLCs for this game (that I probably would've otherwise bought) out of spite. Shame on this singlehandedly bringing a 9/10 game to a 7/10 game. I cannot bring myself to recommend this game when this happens. F*** the publishers who thought the ads were a good idea.

Forza Horizon 5 doesn't do this. It also has much better sounds and a more varied map. Just get that game instead. Or go for a competitor, like BeamNG Drive if you like the sandbox experience with the realistic crashing, or Crew: Motorfest, or something else.

Other cons:
1. A bit too many DLCs for my liking. The major expansions are fine but there's many ""car packs"" and other crap that I shouldn't be getting locked out of my full-priced game.
2. No way to completely disable some sounds. I really don't need to have sound effects blasting my ears, especially with that stupid thunder loading screen.
3. Not the most stable game ever. The game has crashed quite a few times, but not enough to make the game unplayable by any means.",1676761677,1701006778,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First-person driving is so good. My preferred camera mode when chill driving. Rewards are rewarding. The wheel spins provide good rewards like credits, cars, clothes, and emotes. Got two epic rarity cars in a single super wheel spin. 

I wanted a car sim game to just chill and drive. The GTA games made me want one. Could've bought GTAV but I didn't like the cars there. The Forza games were in my radar. This is not the latest but I don't care. It's cheaper than FH5.

I can be either chill or competitive. I mostly just chill and drive with my first bought car, the Nissan GT-R, fully tuned to be at its best with my ideal paint job. Of course I participate in races to earn credits and level up. Right now, I'm racing to buy a Bugatti Chiron and a McLaren Senna. These two beauties are worth it.

First off, the visuals – oh boy, they're mind-blowing. Playground Games nailed the British countryside, and it's not just eye candy. The seasons change, and it's not just for show; it actually messes with the way you tear up the roads. Winter is icy and tricky, while summer feels like your tires are glued to the asphalt. It's not just racing; it's an immersive experience.

Now, let's talk cars. The lineup is a car enthusiast's fantasy come true. From sleek supercars that make you feel like a millionaire to off-road beasts that can handle any terrain, they've got it all. And the handling feels just right – realistic but not so hardcore that you need a degree in engineering to enjoy it. It strikes that perfect balance.

What really sets this game apart is the open-world setup. You're not confined to tracks; you've got this massive map to explore. And the best part? You can do it with friends. Imagine cruising through the English countryside with your buddies, stumbling upon hidden challenges and races – it's like a road trip where the road never ends.

Customization is another ace up Forza Horizon 4's sleeve. You can tweak your ride to your heart's content, both in terms of looks and performance. I've spent hours in the garage fine-tuning my cars, making them truly mine. The level of detail is insane.

And don't get me started on the multiplayer. It's seamlessly integrated into the world. You can team up with friends for races or go head-to-head with random players. It adds a whole new layer of excitement and unpredictability.

In a nutshell, Forza Horizon 4 isn't just a game; it's an experience. It's like the developers sat down and asked, ""How can we make the ultimate racing game?"" and then actually pulled it off. Whether you're a casual gamer looking for a good time or a hardcore racer wanting a challenge, this game's got you covered. Buckle up, hit the gas, and get ready for the road trip of a lifetime. (When I was a child and the game came out I was never able to play it because I had nowhere to play it and now that I have the chance to play it, it is the best of the best, it is almost 2024 and you can only describe this game with one word INCREDIBLE.",1700813793,1700813793,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So if you are only playing on control or pc, then this map is stunning at points and really fun, but for a driving experience: FORZA 5 IS WORLD'S BETTER! Don't get me wrong, I've loved playing parts of this game, but Forza 5 just took all of the really annoying or bad parts of Forza 4 and made them better. Customizing cars is easier and better, using a steering wheel feels better, and the community is more alive.

A once joyous and enjoyable moment has now turned into something youll remember for the rest of your life as a negative moment. This games release was actually kind of decent and this being the first forza game i played with only a keyboard and a budget pc i saved up for years to build. I was happy playing this but as forza horizon 5 released its almost they dropped what there doing and left. Over the months passed. Less and less content was released and turned into dlc's then little to no updates and mostly just event after event which got stale fast. The game That was argued as the last decent forza game released. Has now been left in a very annoying state to play. Anytime me or me trying to convince my friends to play they would stop playing after 30 minutes because they were tired of the bugs, game crashes and unplayable and frankly i was too. The devs have almosty nearly abandoned this game and its no longer fun to play since instead of enjoying the race experience you get to enjoy an unstable game. I dont like this game anymore since its been left behind to rot away from what it once was.

Edit: I don't know wether it is the devs or a nVidia driver update that fixed my problem, but it now works in my old PC. I know for sure that it was a driver update from nVidia that made the game always crash... 

Anyway, I changed my PC (RTX 4080 and Ryzen 7 7800x3D, probably enough to run this game I guess), and had another issue with this same game, causing it to fully use my 32GB of RAM and then crash without even launching. The problem was that the game thought it had to run on the integrated GPU of my CPU, and had to literally go into the BIOS to desactivate it, while uninstalling the drivers for the iGPU in the drivers control pannel. 

It works fine now, and I really enjoy it, but I maintain my negative review because I think a game should be able to run instantly after it is installed, and having to do these types of things to make it work is really not user-friendly. I have the chance to be able to do that because I know how to mess up correctly with computers, but for the others that don't know all this type of stuff, it can be awful to pay a game that you can't play simply because of such poor optimisations, when the game is this old. 

Plus, the support service may not be the worse I've ever seen, but is totally not worth it to loose time to contact them seeing what kind of solutions they have. For my first problem, the people behind it just said to me after sending files about my computer that I had to roll back my nVidia drivers to an older update, which is not a solution in my opinion, but a shitty effortless advice that can cause problems in other games, and in stability of the system overall.

So if you enjoy car games and being a fucking nerd going into stuff deep in your computer to make things work, I recommand this game.",1672787518,1700725876,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a good reason that Horizon 4 is still going for quite strong money even now. Bluntly, playing this 137 hours later, I have no appetite yet for FH5 and think it will be a long time until I do.

FH4 has a fantastic line up of cars, amazing variety of roads and challenges and the multiplayer servers are still very active as a result of a great product. Yes it's not the cheapest racing game out there, but it is packed with content and almost infinite playability. 

Even just taking your favourite car for a ""Sunday drive"" in this game is a pleasure. 

Such as the blueprint feature to let you create your own routes and from there, your own events with so many different cars and classes to choose from. Don't like Horizon's own car classes? No problem. You can make your own.

I recommend saving up just a little bit more and buying the Ultimate Edition. The DLCs are generally quite good value compared to other racing titles.

I'm hoping this isn't peak Forza Horizon as FH6 is in development now, but FH4 will be very hard to beat. My fingers are crossed for Japan to be the final destination, packed with quirky JDM cars and unusual things that Japanese car culture is known and loved for.

There are a lot of activities to do varying from speedtraps to races and etc, and personally the big DLC's (Lego Champions and Fortune Island) arent exactly necessary unless you are the type of person to play a singular game for long periods of time.

Ignore my Steam time.  I've had this on the MS store since launch, but also wanted to buy it here on Steam.  I'm not sure what to say about this game to be honest.  I like it and I also can't stand it.

Pro's:
- Lots of  cars
- Customization
- Housing
- Drag, Drift, Street, Circuit, Sprint races
- Showcase events
- Online group events
- Story chapters, though not really all that interesting to me.  I usually avoid these, aside from the business ones.

Con's:
- Horrible traffic.  Not in the amount of traffic, but in distance that it spawns in.  Clearly imo, traffic is meant to purposely cause accidents and generally annoy players.
- Freeroam is annoying due to traffic.  See above.
- Some events are unreasonably difficult, especially some story chapter events.
- Engine sounds aren't very good in Horizon 4 vs Horizon 3.
- An iffy sense of progression, better than Horizon 5 at least, but far worse the Horizon 3.
- Story chapters range from very boring to pretty decent.  
- Horrible class balance.  Some cars in the same class reach a very high top speed while others are very low; there's no sense of class balance in this game imo.
- No car meet 

So that's pretty much it.  The game is awesome in some areas and horrible in other areas imo.  Forza Horizon 3 is still the better game in comparison to both Horizon 4 and Horizon 5.  

In any case, it's worth buying during or not during a sale.",1669837008,1700160889,True,0,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False

The graphics are stunning and the changing seasons make the game fun all the time. It's the classic FH experience but with added challenges. The cars look stunning and most of the terrain feels realistic and driveable. The soundtrack is also brilliant, but it does get a little repetitive after a few hours. There's loads of radio stations but very few songs I enjoyed after nearly 600 hours. The challenges and story missions are fun, with the right amount of effort required (in my opinion). The car customisation is also good; I can build my car to be what I want without much limitation to what there is available.

On the downside, there was the issue where the game used to crash without the right graphics driver, but this is fixed.  After that, there was no limit to how much fun I had. I have 100% achievements and look forward to playing FH5. It's perfection, in my opinion. 10/10",1700053505,1700053505,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i] Originally I've reviewed this game as ""Do not recommend"" because it wasn't launching on my PC at all. 
Now i have a new PC and the game works like a charm, so it warrants a review update. [/i]

Game is really cool, so far I like it. 
Driving feels good, graphics and sound are superb. 

The biggest caveat I have is the amount of paywalls: tons of interesting cars and events are locked behind DLC. I like the approach Gran Turismo 7 took in that regard: all cars are accessible without microtransactions via in-game currency. Would prefer if it was the same way here. Now I wonder if bying Ultimate edition instead of Standard would be a better way.

Overall the game is fun and feels great to drive around in.

You get to solely focus on creating and driving your own dream car, find a new one, or try collecting from over 600 cars. With amazing soundtracks, graphics and performance, the Forza Horizon series are a masterpiece when it comes to arcade racing game genre.

The anywhere fast travel is one of the best addition to the game and it really makes a huge difference. I recommend smashing all the 50 fast travel boards so it won't cost you anything to fast travel. There's also other much needed QOL features that were not present in previous games.

Freeroam rush is just a brainless gamemode that they haven't even bothered to separate from Dirt Adventure (I forgot what it's called) in 5 YEARS of the game release. As for Road adventure, you cannot only play circuit race; you will have to also play street races. Again, they haven't even bothered separate the categories between street racing and circuit racing. If you're trying to use Open season, it's pretty much dead to me if you're trying to play a B-class car in road racing for example, and most likely you will encounter high level player  with A-class car lobby that you barely know anything about tuning

I revisited the game after many months.
Stability issues with constant crashes are gone. The online feature of the game also works.

Big thumbs up!


Hello everybody, 
here is the replay from Forza Support that I got yesterday regarding the freezing of the game on Steam for players with Nvidia GPUs: 


""Hello,

We're investigating some issues around the NVIDIA drivers affecting gameplay and stability in Forza Horizon 4.

Please try the following troubleshooting.
•	Try to download the Nvidia Studio drivers 
•	OR reinstall an older driver from Sept. or earlier.""

So nothing new, but at least they are trying to work it out.",1675285680,1697921429,True,0,0,0.585368096828460693,1,True,False,False

Forza Horizon 4 isn't just a game; it's an automotive symphony that unfolds across the changing seasons of the picturesque British countryside. With 16.4 hours behind the wheel, it's evident that this game isn't just a racing title; it's an exhilarating journey through a dynamic and beautifully rendered world.

The most striking aspect of Forza Horizon 4 is its ever-evolving environment. The game takes place in a shared open-world, where the seasons change not just in appearance but in how they impact your driving experience. The transition from the lush greenery of spring to the icy roads of winter isn't just visual; it changes how each car handles, offering a new dimension of strategy and challenge.

The United Kingdom's countryside is meticulously recreated, offering a diverse and stunning backdrop for your racing adventures. From the rolling hills of the Cotswolds to the city streets of Edinburgh, the attention to detail is nothing short of impressive. It's a world that encourages exploration, with hidden barn finds and stunt jumps waiting to be discovered.

Forza Horizon 4 embraces an accessible but deep racing experience. The game's vast car roster, ranging from vintage classics to modern supercars, ensures there's a vehicle for every taste. The driving physics strike a balance between realism and fun, and players can tailor their driving aids to match their skill level. This adaptability makes the game appealing to both casual players and racing enthusiasts.

The Festival concept, which serves as the game's framework, works brilliantly. The sense of camaraderie and competition among the festival-goers enhances the immersion and the social aspects of the game. You can take part in a variety of events, from traditional races to showcase events that pit you against trains, planes, and even hovercraft.

One of the game's standout features is the ability to create and share custom race routes. This player-generated content adds endless replayability and creativity to the game, allowing you to design your dream racecourses or tackle those crafted by others.

The visuals and audio design of Forza Horizon 4 are top-notch. The game is a visual spectacle, with stunning weather effects, realistic lighting, and breathtaking car models. The engine roars, the tire squeals, and the music selection amplify the sense of exhilaration, creating a truly immersive experience.

While the game is superb, there are a few minor drawbacks. The Drivatar AI can sometimes exhibit overly aggressive behavior, which can be frustrating. Additionally, while the in-game purchases are optional, they are present and could potentially detract from the sense of accomplishment through natural progression.

In conclusion, Forza Horizon 4 is a racing game that transcends the genre. It's a celebration of the joy of driving and exploration, offering an accessible yet deep experience for racing enthusiasts and casual players alike. With its dynamic seasons, diverse car roster, and stunning British landscape, it's a title that keeps you coming back for more. Whether you're a petrolhead or just looking for a good time, Forza Horizon 4 delivers an unforgettable journey through speed and beauty.

4 seems more fun than 5. It's not that 5 is bad... it's the 4 that gives you more than 5.
Many free cars. lots of cars, lots of events.
The only thing that's totally not cool is that you can't switch car during event. You have to quit event, then change car and return to event. Meanwhile you can switch difficulty in-game and race only reloads. Why devs couldn't make same things when you want to change car?
And yes, graphics are nice.

Реально бесит только одна вещь, которая перекочевала в 5 часть. Нельзя менять машину во время заезда. Надо сначала выйти с трассы, сменить машину и вернуться обратно в заезд. Муторно, долго. При этом во время заезда можно сменить сложность и трасса только перезагружается. Что помешало сделать так же при смене машины, непонятно.

Not to mention with the auction house and wheel spins featured in the game any player can be driving around in a desirable car mere hours after first launch cutting back on the build up and getting the player head deep in those intense races as soon as possible. A beautiful, large, vast and evolving open world designed carefully with all details of driving in mind even the mere sights alone would be enough to keep the player suitably entertained and with fairly priced DLCs that bring more innovation and variety to the racing events available you can truly think you've seen it all in this game and would've barely started.

This is a beautiful open world game with events that you can drop in around the map. You can play each race dozens or even hundreds of times because each style of car makes the race a different experience. Loosely tied in to the Top Gear show, with Chris Harris contributing his voice to a small part of the game - even The Stig makes an appearance! 

I also bought the James Bond car pack that adds about a dozen cars from the Bond movies but there doesn't seem to be any Bond content. Still fun to go bombing around in the DB5 or Wet Nelly.

I do have one big issue. After a few hours of game play I can't play online and can only play with in-game players. Not multiplayer. This is frustrating if you want to play against friends or random strangers. This is a known problem and can be fixed but it involves editing the registry which I find a bit crap to be honest.

I Fixed game lol

If you have infinite loading screen issue before you start this game go to nvidia control panel and find:

3D settings -> find vertical sync -> turn ON

apply and ok and start game now!

Now after you hopefully load in game do few races and save new local file/cloud file and exit game 

Go back to Nvidia Control panel but this time disable forced Vsync, hit apply and then ok and steam version should work again but this time without V sync, worked in my case but in worst case scenario you will need to keep v sync on...",1680892976,1696566221,True,0,0,0.491907447576522827,0,True,False,False

I have seen the excellent progression in game play, story, graphics and whatnot and I am very impressed with Forza 4. I love the open-world aspect as well as the ability to drive around with random people in the world and race or whatever. Great graphics, Great story, definitely has ""replay-ability"". Played for a long time on my Xbox and was very excited to see that it had been released on steam. This game really gives you that dopamine fix and the immersion into this world is unreal.
Worth it 100%. 
P.S. I have Horizon 5 as well and I keep coming back to 4.

-Excellent Graphics
-Story Progression (SP and/or Co-op)
-Excellent Immersion (Really feel like your actually there)
-Driving Simulator

Great game! Highly Recommend.

1. apparently no Australia/Asian server so my game is constantly lagged even on a stable 100Mbs connection which doesn't lag on any other game.
2. ABUSIVE in-game ads.  I have already paid money for this game so  GET  LOST.
3. Challenges are retarded.  An example of a game in which the developers don't play the game.
4. game is full of bugs.  If you continue to sell the game as new, FIX THE BUGS.  For example Austin Seven constantly goes through the ground after going off jumps.
5. making vehicles so you cannot collide with them is INCONSISTENT. For example, bot cars disappear in the drift zone, but this should happen automatically whenever you go over 250km/hr.  I have spent over twenty (20) attempts trying to get 3 stars on speed traps but continually assaulted by bots making it an impossible task.  I game that should be fun becomes a HATE WASTELAND.

I would recommend grabbing the ultimate edition on a deep sale, there is a lot of content that i think is worth the extra 10 dollars or so. 

The map in this game may not be as exotic as some others in the series, but I think it is tastefully done and the expansion map destinations are pretty fun. Fortune Island in particular is pretty neat, sort of a north sea island setting. 

Performance wise the game is pretty good, similar to the other games available on PC. Pretty good visuals for the time it released and still looks great compared to contemporary titles. well optimized and flexible on a variety of hardware. I have not encountered any bugs of note in this game, and it has been very stable. 

I really enjoy the balance they strike with the handling model in these games. If you have liked the previous titles (or even FH5) I think this one slots into your collection just fine.",1695578968,1695578968,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So why the thumbs down? Because MS/Playground seem to not give a flying <bleep> about the bugs they left in the game for years, never bothering to fix them. Online racing is borderline impossible as you sit there looking at a load screen for 10 minutes every time (no I'm not exaggerating). The same thing happens in any of the story missions if you choose replay. The only way to avoid it there is to quit and load the same mission again, which often involves driving to a faraway destination in a slow car before you can attempt the actual mission objective, and/or you have to sit through unskippable cutscenes every time.
If you enjoy arcade racers and don't mind only playing solo (or are very patient) then this is still an easy recommendation, but publishers/devs should not keep getting away with stuff like this.",1695047619,1695047619,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is the idealization of owning and driving your dream car.
Good map layout, a really good selection of cars. 
Superb graphics when you take PC requirements into account.
Driving physics which are easier to pickup and hard to master.

So why the ""okay""?
 
The game to this day has issue regarding crashes, you see discussion topics like this regularly.
You cant mute people's microphones in game(change your smoke alarm batteries),  you have to go to your XBOX profile settings.
The characters are annoying, you cant mute them, but you can ""tolerate"".

But the worst thing by far in this game: it has FOMO (fear of missing out) tactics, 
and just to cut it to the chase, some cars will be almost impossible to acquire.
They were focusing too much on player retention rather than giving a shorter and more enjoyable experience of the game. 

Buy this game if it goes on >50% sale. imho better than FH5

TBH, I don't really miss FH4 anymore. the reason i enjoyed playing FH4 in the past was only before Forza Horizon 5 came out.

Long wait times so you'll spend more time waiting for the game to load than race if you choose to race online. 

People are ramming every race, meta rules the game so literally no different than what's happening now. 

Weather is unique since it's in the UK so that's a plus I guess. 

Car sounds and physics and graphic are not as good as FH5s. 

FH4 does have a good car selection. 

Overall unless you want to experience racing in different types of weather and explore the UK, it's really not worth getting.

Was pretty torn wether to set it as a positive or a negative review. Well, there is a lot to love, and a lot bringing it down. From full bliss to total cringe, swinging constantly.

Let's put it this way: Horizon 4 is an amazing car sandbox and an ugly mess of a racing game.

Amazing handling model, easy to pick up, yet pretty deep and realistic enough, and given the massive car list with the amount of performance upgrade and tuning available, that is a massive achievement.
The map is just breathtaking with tons of goodies to explore... found myself taking photos herding sheep with a Jeep just for vibes.

On the other hand the campaign progression is practically non-existent. A very hype intro, a long and extremely hand-holding tutorial, where it gradually opens up and starts showering you with wheelspins: random chance of cars/credits/vanity items. You could get the fastest hypercars in the 1st hour if RNG decides to bless/curse you with it and get showered with tens of cars almost instantly. This practically killed any sense of progress and meaningful achievement for me. And I specifically picked 4 over 5 as my first Forza Horizon game hoping it's not as much of a vapid instant gratification BS. Like this is a AAA racing game, right? Not a free-to-play gatcha colectathon, then why that vibe of those with gambling and addiction mechanics? At least no paid loot boxes, so fine I guess.
Still almost ragequited when seeing the McLaren F1's pricetag... bit over the 1mil mark, around the same as NFS Unbound, but that was a fair grind given the car's power and IRL heritage, here it looked disrespectfully low compared to the tempo of the in-game economy.
Oh well, there are tons of small metrics acting as branching paths of bucket lists to carve your adventure on the festival, so there is much fun to be had after that initial shock.

AI opponents are a mess. As much as the Drivatar system is some real tech wizardry, it results in little more than an overengineered perlin-noise for a dumb core system tugging them along a sloppily programmed racing line.
Another retard mistake is, how if you turn on damage simulation, it only gets applied to you, not the AI. On an offroad race, I always pulled ahead in lap1 EZ, but they always caught up and gained unreasonable lead later. That's when I realised, the unavoidable big jump only decreased my engine performance, not theirs. How do mistakes of this caliber don't get noticed by QA before release in a series of this pedigree!?

So, very strong foundations in world design and the cars, unlimited amounts of fun. And all that gets soured by ton's of stupid stuff I can't comprehend how a developer on this level can make. Still, that core is so strong it won't make me regret the purchase or stop playing. But as popular as it got, the Horizon series is not perfect by a long shot.",1694553418,1694553418,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

now if i read something incorrect, or i missed something completely and either you can play the game without an account or there was another comment saying you need the account, please let me know. politely, and i will be more than happy to change my review and retract my comments. i do want to play this game, it looks and sounds hella fun. however, i can't do that. so i'm really pissed.",1694408463,1694408770,False,2,0,0.481802970170974731,0,True,False,False

If you've ever dreamed of taking your grandma's vintage sedan for a spin on a Scottish countryside, only to end up doing a triple backflip off a cliff, then Forza Horizon 4 is the game you never knew you needed in your life!

I stumbled into Forza Horizon 4 expecting a relaxing Sunday drive through picturesque landscapes. Little did I know, I'd soon be soaring through the air like a caffeinated seagull on a Red Bull binge!

The game starts with you, a normal human being with a questionable driver's license, being dropped into the British countryside with a car that has more horsepower than the entire cast of Fast & Furious combined. You're immediately given the keys to the kingdom (or rather, the ignition to your dream car) and told to go forth and conquer the open-world map. And conquer I did!

But don't let the lush meadows and quaint villages fool you; this game is a certified adrenaline junkie's paradise. One minute, you're cruising down a narrow country lane, narrowly avoiding sheep, and the next, you're drifting through ancient stone circles like a modern-day Druid.

And the cars! Oh, the cars! Forza Horizon 4 has more cars than a parking lot at a Justin Bieber concert. From vintage classics to hypercars that make your heart race faster than a cheetah with an energy drink addiction, there's a vehicle for every type of player. You can even customize them to your heart's content, as long as your heart's content includes neon pink paint and a spoiler that could double as an aircraft wing.

The game's weather system is like Mother Nature on a rollercoaster binge. One moment, you're racing under sunny skies, and the next, you're hydroplaning through a monsoon that would put Noah's flood to shame. It's all part of the fun and keeps you on your toes, or rather, your tires.

Forza Horizon 4 also has a knack for turning the most mundane objects into potential launch ramps. Stone walls, farmhouses, and innocent pedestrians all become part of your high-octane playground. Just remember to apologize to the sheep if you accidentally launch them into low Earth orbit.

But it's not all chaos and mayhem. The game also has a fantastic music lineup that caters to every taste, from classical to hip-hop. You can choose your own soundtrack or just listen to the in-game radio. And honestly, nothing beats drifting through the Scottish Highlands while listening to Beethoven's 9th Symphony. It's a cultural experience like no other.

In conclusion, Forza Horizon 4 is not just a game; it's a wild, hilarious, and occasionally heart-stopping adventure through the British countryside. It's the kind of game that turns your driving skills from ""Sunday driver"" to ""X Games contender.""

GRAPHICS
Literally looks like real life, outside of the character models. But thankfully we're just focusing on cars in this game. 9.5/10

GAMEPLAY
Fun, reactive gameplay from the different cars available to drive. I really enjoyed how cars with power steering control differently from those without, definitely adds to the realism and shows Playground's attention to detail in crafting the game. Cars perform differently depending on the upgrades and tuning that are installed, and you can easily spend hours in the upgrade menus just experimenting with different builds. There's also a tuning share feature where you can download other players' builds, though unfortunately it doesn't let you expand off of those downloaded builds. 9.5/10

STORY
Forza Horizon 4 continues the series' tradition of forgoing a traditional story mode in favor of multiple side story quests that help you level up and earn rewards. From stunt driving for a movie to escorting people in a souped-up taxicab, the side missions really add some fun to the game outside of normal exhibition races.  8/10

ONLINE
I don't play too much online, mainly because of the community and the fact that Microsoft will ban you for sneezing in the wrong direction. I only play online if I'm testing out drag racing builds with friends. 6/10

BUGS/OPTIMIZATION
Very few bugs. Granted I am reviewing this 5 years after the game launched but the point still stands. The game has always been fairly polished and never felt like a chore to play. Only massive bug I've experienced was jumping off a ramp and then my car clipped through and fell through the map. After about 4 seconds, the car respawned on solid ground. Other than that, nothing to report in the way of bugs. 9.5/10

DLC/MONETIZATION
The game is heavily monetized as is the case with most of Microsoft's games. However, the monetization never feels intrusive. You can still have a great experience without the DLC cars or world expansions. I didn't even have DLC access until I purchased the Deluxe Edition on sale here on Steam. But I can see why people wouldn't like cars that can give you a competitive advantage in multiplayer locked behind a paywall. 8/10

VERDICT
Forza Horizon 4 is definitely the best in the series and my personal favorite racing game of all time. I can definitely see myself playing this for years to come.  8.4/10",1682474309,1694014528,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The video settings are reset every time I start this game. I'm tired of having to configure the video settings every time.
When the race is over and I want to restart, I see the usual long loading screen, the game is trying to clear the whole world in RAM and reload... You just need to spawn me at the start line and restart the race, not rebuild the world...
I have a Seagate 2TB Firecuda 520 NVMe PCIe Gen4 M.2 SSD (5000MB read / 4400MB write).

From the moment I started playing the series, I started praying for the game to end so I could delete it. Because the show series is very boring and if you accidentally press the restart button at the end of a show race, the game restarts without asking you ""Are you sure?"" and the stars and time you have earned are wasted.

So the game itself is great. Looks beautiful, good cars, physics etc.
My problem is first of all starting the game. I have to have Bluetooth turned on(nothing connected) to start the game, otherwise the game just vanishes after the loading screen. Then sometimes my controller and headset are just not recognized so i have to restart the game again. So most of the time it takes me 2-3 starts to actually start the game. 
Then comes the game where actual i have only one complaint. My cars liveries just changes for races or after races. Of course if it changes stays that way, not only changes for the race itself. Cant tell you how much this annoys me.
Actually i can. So much that i just uninstalled it.

This feels like an actual automotive fantasy powetrip put into play, with so many cars to drive and collect, different kinds of events and activities to try out and experiment while driving on a really nice looking and overall fun map to explore, with the weather dynamic changing the map ever so slightly every week, which keeps the game fresh.

All of this brought out with the most satisfying driving model and physics I've experienced in a modern arcade racing game, with some foot ground on the arcade-sim like but with its notches dialed up for the fun aspect, make this a really strong title. 

Some of my grips with the game come from the story/campaign (or lack thereof), issues with the multiplayer and online connectivity, and the progression systems that feels mostly tied to the wheelspin mechanic, however the core gameplay and feel of the game is so good, that I'm able to overlook these issues and still have a great time with the game, even if I was late to the party.",1693771424,1693771450,True,1,0,0.505494534969329834,0,True,False,False

Graphics: 10/10
No of Cars: 10/10
Handling: 8/10
Story/Progression system: 7/10
Online/Multiplayer: 2/10 - Just horrible. Load times take forever. Sometimes unfair team distribution.
Car Customisation: 5/10 - It is nothing when compared to NFS titles (except some)
Car Upgrading & Performance tuning: 9/10 - Feels so real when you see every stat you change is affecting how the car handles.
Map: 8/10 - Great!
DLCs (Fortune Island + LEGO): 8/10 - Worth buying. Provides so much playtime but lets be real though, kinda feels boring when you have to do repetitive things.

AI Difficulty/ Drivatars: When set to Highly Skilled and above, there is a bug with the AI especially the one who is in the first place. You have to catch up to him in the very beginning of the race or else you will never be able to pass him. He will be miles ahead of you and the rest of the pack of racers.
Secondly, Drivatars don't follow the rules of physics that apply to your car. They will turn at greater speeds than you with losing speed, won't skid or anything like that whereas you'll be sliding left and right and colliding way to often if you try to imitate them. So, in conclusion, NEVER EVER set the difficulty of the Drivatars above Highly Skilled if you plan to have a good time with the game and not just go ranting left and right about it to everyone and everywhere.

Car/ engine sounds: 7/10 - Not always accurate for every car: A hatch-back random Renault car from the story was sounding like BMW M3 GTR from NFS MW '05

Conclusion: If you are planning to buy this game on full price, NO! Rather buy Forza Horizon 5. Only worth buying ON SALE.",1693653572,1693653572,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first thing that struck me was the breathtaking open-world environment. The fictionalized rendition of Great Britain is a sight to behold, with picturesque landscapes that transition seamlessly from the historic city streets to the serene countryside. Dynamic weather and seasonal changes add a layer of realism that I've never experienced in a racing game before. Whether it's a summer breeze or a snowy blizzard, the world feels alive and constantly evolving.

The car roster is a dream come true for any gearhead. The meticulous attention to detail in each vehicle is awe-inspiring; you can practically hear the engines roar as you accelerate through the diverse array of races and challenges. The progression system is well-balanced, allowing both casual and hardcore players to find their own pace. Whether you're a fan of street racing, off-road adventures, or just cruising around, Forza Horizon 4 has something for everyone.

The Festival atmosphere adds a unique layer of excitement. The events are varied and creatively designed, ensuring that monotony never creeps in. Teaming up with friends for cooperative challenges or engaging in nail-biting PvP races in the shared world is an absolute blast. The seamless online integration is a testament to Playground Games' commitment to delivering an unparalleled multiplayer experience.

What truly sets Forza Horizon 4 apart is the level of customization. You're not just modifying your cars; you're crafting a personal identity. The ability to create custom paint jobs, tunes, and even your own races injects a sense of ownership that extends beyond the virtual garage.

However, it's the attention to player feedback that truly shines. The developers have shown an ongoing commitment to improvement, frequently adding new cars, events, and features through updates. This dedication to enhancing the game's content and addressing community concerns speaks volumes about the team behind it.

Forza Horizon 4 is a masterpiece that elevates the racing genre to unparalleled heights. It's a visual and auditory feast that caters to both casual players and hardcore racers. The seamless blend of stunning visuals, exhilarating gameplay, and a thriving online community make it a must-play for any gamer, even if you're not traditionally a racing enthusiast.

Recommend? Yes. Hands down the best racing game I've ever played in my life. The sheer amount of content, the seamless multiplayer (esp. in FH5), the magnitude of things to do, along with the PERFECT racing feel have all conspired to make this easily the best racing experience I've ever had.

It is WONDERFUL that this game is not plagued with ""pay to win,"" and that you don't have to be level one million to have great cars. You can get some pretty fantastic cars fairly early on, so when you're racing against others, if you lose you know it's not necessarily because the other players have spent 17 billion years playing. (Although, of course, it will take a LONG time to get ALL the cars.)

So what's the basic gameplay? Well, you're a driver. You're in a huge, open-world map. You drive around, you enter races, you do tricks/stunts, you play missions, all kinds of stuff. You earn money and experience doing so, and use that money to... buy new cars. You then race those cars to... earn more money. While in the open map, you're in a playground with the other players (and it's such a nice turn of pace that you can't crash each other in the open world). When racing, you can race against AI, other players, whatever you want.

There are a ton of different race types - road, dirt, off-road, street (where normal traffic is left on the roads) and more. There are co-op races and pvp races, and each is fantastic in its own right. There are ""games"" you can play (various co-op ""car tag"" type games). There are ""stunt"" zones where you might try to earn high scores with speed, drifting, jumps, and more. There are storyline missions - and while the ""stories"" aren't very deep, they're certainly fun. Basically, there's just... no end of stuff to do.

This is only made more fun by the ""seasons."" Each week is a new ""season"" (summer, winter, etc in FH4 and wet, dry, et in FH5). There are 4 seasons in each round, and during those different seasons there are ""seasonal events"" you can participate in to earn a ton of bonus stuff - so every week, you've got brand new ways to race, earn experience, win cars, and more. Plus, that means that each week the scenery and road conditions change!

There are ""upgrades."" Yes, you can add/remove/tune all kinds of parts in your car to upgrade/downgrade it. Some folks spend a TON of time on this... others, like me, mainly just download fits/tunes made by other players. So if you don't feel like spending forever tinkering, you can do like I do and just browse others' tunes.

You can play pre-made routes, or create your own. Some players spend a ton of time creating really interesting routes... so even after you've raced the included races a billion times, there's still endless content for you to enjoy with more coming.

Plus, Forza works on Steam Deck. It says unsupported, but it works. (Well, FH4 took a dump on me for a couple weeks at one point & wouldn't launch.. but works again) SD tips: set the game to run on Proton Experimental. Set your SD options to cap the framerate to 30FPS. Set resolution to 1280x800 and set graphics pre-sets to high. In game, set the FPS limit to 60 and see if it runs well for you; if not, set it to 30FPS. WIth these settings I have been able to play just fine.

The racing ""feel"" is just flawless. One of my favorite parts of Just Cause 3 and GTA V are the driving, because it just ""feels"" so natural. You don't spend a ton of time trying to ""get"" the controls... you just kind of ease into them and you're off. It's JUST like that in Forza Horizon. I never feel like I didn't win a race because I was ""cheated"" or fighting the controls. (Only side note - the drift mechanics feel a little bleh in FH4, especially with the scoring, but it still feels just right.)

Interaction between players is fun & fair. You can honk at each other or use little phrases with each other. In open world, you're in ""ghost"" mode & can't wreck each other. You can play around but not screw each other up. In co-op games you can make contact, but go ghost if you're in some kind of situation where things could be unfair (eg if I'm screaming up behind you & don't see that you're stopped, one of us will go ghost so I don't totally knock you to the moon). Other games are full contact, such as the ""games"" mini games (of which there are several). So, honestly, the multiplayer aspects are just fantastic - we can get all the feel of driving/racing around with each other, without tons of griefers.

Another thing that's really fun is that NOT... ever car is a ""super"" car. You play some games where every car in the game is on a slider from ""high end"" to ""space shuttle"".. but this game features LOADS of different types of cars so you can jump in on any race experience you want. With the LOADS of racing styles and TONS of different car types (from ""can barely move down the road"" to ""I think I just hit light speed), you can participate in just about any type of race you want.

AND... the stats on the car actually MATTER. Plenty of race games, I more or less ignore the car stat ratings, but whatever the case is, this game will actually have you browsing through your hundreds of cars, trying to pick the right vehicle for the task at hand.

So what are the differences?

FH4 takes places in the UK; FH5 takes place in Mexico. Generally speaking, FH5 is ""slightly better"" in nearly all regards to FH4. This doesn't mean FH4 sucks by any means; I love the series so much I still regularly play FH4 all the time and complete all the seasonal events. It's like if your favorite pizza is Super Supreme but you still like taco pizza. Most of the time you'll get the supreme.. but you still love taco and eat it for variety. I spend ost of my time in FH5, but still have lots of fun in 4.

There are over 700 cars in each. The maps in FH5 are a little bigger. The mountains, etc seem a little taller. The graphics in 4 are amazing; the graphics in 5 are phenomenal. Sounds in 4 are great... in 5 they blow me away. Multiplayer in 4 is pretty reliable but occasionally lags or gets stuck... MP in 5 is just about as seamless as it gets. Add-on content is slightly more fun in 5. Custom content (custom routes, etc) are a little more abundant in 5. Menus, options, etc are a little cleaner and more easy to navigate in 5. Drifting scoring is a lot more fun in 5. 4 has a great mix of curvy, dirt, and straights... But in FH5, they built in an extra long stretch of straight road for those folks who really want to put their rides to the test. There are also more places to interact with non-driving content (eg. auto show to buy cars, places to upgrade/tune) in FH5... and there's even a ""test track"" where you can work on car fits, drive a little, work some more, drive a little. It makes upgrading slightly easier in 5.

Overall, I would say start with 5 if you're on the fence. Even if FH4 is on sale & FH5 isn't, I'd still recommend 5 just because the edge 5 has on 4 is significant enough to really make a difference. AGAIN, not saying 4 is ""bad."" I would also recommend buying the full package, or premium, or whatever the heck it was called. You really do get a TON more bang for your buck. I would also recommend owning the DLC's - they are a blast in their own right, and add additional seasonal events as well in both 4 & 5!!

Would I recommend waiting for sale vs paying full price? Well, I bought both on sale... but as big a fan as I am of these worlds, I would easily recommend playing full price, no questions asked. Yes, it's a little steep, but so worth it. HOWEVER, if you're strapped for cash, just add it to your wishlist & wait. These titles go on sale (for a pretty decent discount) fairly often.

Yes, these two titles are going to be my FAVORITE racing ones of all time... Until FH6 comes along, of course.",1693422438,1693422438,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

The Steam version of FH4 and MS Store version are TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS. MS Store version works perfectly fine, but the steam one have 10 degree, baked in, permanent deadzone with deadzone being set to 0 in game options, nothing can fix it, and nobody apparently, even the developer. Another thing that is broken in the Steam Edition is the H/stick shifter! I thought that FH4 in general had a problem with a shifter being connected separately... but since I bought the Microsoft Store version I know that's not true as... As the moment I started playing the MS Store version not only the dreadful deadzone was gone, but also, my Thrustmaster shifter started magically working! So yea, Steam version of FH4 is a broken scam, don't buy it here, if you intend to play it with the wheel, like me.

I wasted a lot of time on the Steam version, and finally reached the breaking point and got the MS Store one and all the infuriating problems vanished, but I have to start over, all my over 500 cars gone, all my houses gone, all the credits gone, everything, had to start from scratch. Don't be like me thinking you can take the 10 degree deadzone, you can't, it drives like crap. Just wait for a promotion on MS Store or buy a gamepass.

PS: Just so you know, FH 5 works perfectly fine on Steam however, no deadzone, shifter works as intended... althought it loads for ages after launch. Noticed that FH4 from the MS Store launches 10 times as fast as the Steam version tho, wonder if it's the same case for MS S. FH5 version too, but not wasting my money on potential faster launch load times.
PS2: got to test FH5 Microsoft version and it loads in similar time and runs the same, so it's safe to buy FH5 on Steam.

PS2: The Dev's response is an automated one, unrelated to anything mentioned in this review. FH4 on Steam got a loads of bad reviews because it was unplayable for literally few months on Nvidia graphic cards, so I guess they just add that automatic response to every negative review now. All the problems mentioned in this review still persist and will persist forever, there either is no possibility to fix them in the Steam version, or no will to do it from the Dev's.",1678296307,1693388270,False,4,0,0.579288065433502197,1,True,False,False

* Mixed feelings about the music selection

Overall, Forza Horizon 4 offers a fantastic racing experience with the added fun of off-roading. The game features enjoyable racing and driving mechanics, along with extensive car customization options.

Haven't even managed to unlock ranked adventure since finding and/or completing enough unranked races is impossible. 

The load times of multiplayer events are so ridiculous I'm starting to question if there's only a single server running one race at a time for all players. 20-30 minutes is nothing just to get to race once - mind you an adventure has 3+ races, and the wait is the same between them. I did my laundry, prepared lunch and read a bunch of reddit troubleshooting posts in detail while witnessing the game only proceed from ""players getting rewards"" waiting lobby onto a ""fast-traveling other players"" loading screen before calling it quits. 

There's also other horseshit such as the game making you wait just to load you into an event that just finished - which means you just went through the whole process of waiting the match to finish and to hand out rewards to the players, just to start all over again.

Oh yeah, and there's no proper lobby selection possibility. You just press a button to search for a race and hope to god the little lonesome server isn't too badly on fire at the moment.",1693159788,1693159788,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The only thing it's good for is being an open world driving game, everything else is horrendous. Online is terrible, weekly challenges are the worst, and championships are dry and infuriating. There is nothing rewarding about this game, other than just driving in different cars and doing the occasional race.

Don't do the challenges. Do the races, but nothing else. The challenges are terribly designed so that you waste hours upon hours of your time trying to earn some random car or reward only for the game to withhold it from you for no reason. Upon first look, the game has lots of content, which is not untrue. But the ""content"" is just a bunch of different ways for you to waste your time on. The only reason you should ever do the challenges is if they're fun, but oftentimes they are not. The issue with the challenges is that they are very unclear and sometimes just outright broken. Sometimes you'll complete a challenge and despite knowing for a fact that you did what they wanted you to do, you still won't get the reward and the game will say the challenge hasn't been completed. Other times you'll have no idea how to even [i]do[/i] the challenge, or you'll think you know how to do it but it still won't work.

Other annoying things:

-Queuing for an online match gets cancelled if you don't return to freeroam within 10 seconds, which would be easy if the menu system wasn't an absolute nightmare. Especially annoying since you have to wait a few minutes to even connect to a match.
-Can't mute players and their ****** dog
-Sometimes you get a 1+ minute ad right as you open up the game. Not even free games do this.
-Used to crash frequently for no reason
-Fast travelling costs credits, which is fine, but it even costs credits to fast travel to your home, which is already useless enough as it is
-The rewind is so needlessly slow. Like, it's for rewinding when you mess up, why does it need to be in slow motion? Even worse, it's incredibly janky and sometimes doesn't work for no reason. 
-Weekly challenges are horribly janky, unpleasant, and unbalanced. You'll spend an hour trying to complete one, only for it to stop updating your progress, so nothing you do works. Or you'll be 3/4 of the way through one and it'll give you a challenge that you can't even do because you haven't unlocked the event. It's so bad that only 9.3% of players have completed one.
-It automatically connects you to a server in [i]freeroam[/i], so you'll just lag randomly, even when playing by yourself. Literally the only thing you can do with other players in freeroam is challenge them to a race, which is entirely car-dependent.
-The menus are a pain to navigate because there'll be submenus within other completely unrelated submenus and there are soo many submenus. Literally more than half the main menu is just for DLCs or useless stuff.
-There are so many needless and annoying prompts and menus. Trying to actually do something using the menus takes forever.
-Has problems saving, so every so often you'll unlock something you've already unlocked, or events will say new even if you've already completed them

All in all, I'd never pay $80 for a game as tedious and unpleasant as this one. There are free games with far better user-friendliness, UI, and overall quality than Forza Horizon 4.",1667073800,1693095114,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is truly a brilliant game. I still remember when I bought it in May of last year. I didn't have my desk and the large monitor for gaming yet. I played with a keyboard and mouse, eventually putting it aside. However, this year, in 2023, I have all of these setups. I have to say, I'm not typically someone interested in game plots, but I was drawn in by the storyline of Forza Horizon 4. 

Here, you can drive freely anywhere you want, embarking on your adventure. You can take part in races or simply admire the scenery. Unlocking new areas has become so addictive. You might, after countless near misses (because I'm not used to driving on the left side of the road), suddenly discover a new villa. It could be near the carnival or offer a great view of the lake. What's more, you can open the map and set your destination, just like how I used to play GTA when I was young. Drive to that location and suddenly touch a memory from back then. 

I want to say it's really a brilliant game, just like every time I go past an electronics shop and see the Xbox demo for Forza Horizon; I'm always captivated.

The customization, although quite in depth when it comes to the mechanical side, the visual customization might feel limited in some cars (especially if you come from nfs/older forza motorsports). I have enjoyed my time completing challenges and races of all kinds with the only exception those that are located within the city center, its bad enough that 90% of the players drive on the right side of the road, having to get used to narrow(-er) AND left side driving in city roads on a circuit where there are AI cars....ain't it. Not bad enough to give the game a bad score or anything...just mildy annoying for the 5-7 races that are located there. Nature in the game looks beautful, cars are very well modeled and yet surprizigly the game runs very well on a system that has aged quite a bit (1050ti,3600x amd and 16g RAM) with mixed (mostly high) settings. If i had to make a criticism it would be physics, although rewarding and well balanced between arcade and sim id say the cars feel quite understeery, that wouldnt be a problem if the AI didnt feel as if it was on rails compared to you at the highest difficulty settings (could bypass it by following broken/competetive setups-builds from the internet but...come on...).

Like, why the heck they removed Ranked games? It's a way for people to improve up on and keep up lobbies populated in any game which is good for player(s) side and developers side. Physics is stable and diverse than FH5, especially for RWD cars the diversity in controls are felt great. The developers cannot make it the fixed seasonal changes in the recent title too, which su*ks. Soundtracks are not the best I would say, it's way better than FH5 and I have some favourite tracks as well. Most of the campaign stories were cool, except the LEGO 'Hype Tour' which felt like doing same sh*t again and again because of the use of 3 cars out of 5 LEGO cars for 9 story chapters that they have got there, duh. Although, apart from that this game feels vibrant and lively through out its impressive game play. Indeed it's truly a gem to Racing games category and all of the games in total, A true evergreen masterpiece!

Here is my take on it:
- The good: good graphics, lots of vehicles.
- The bad: yep, this is definitely not a racing simulator. If that's what you are looking for, my advise - look elsewhere. This is an arcade all right. Nothing wrong with this, just different type of a game.

However, here is the really bad part: racing wheel support. Yes, it is the worst I've ever seen, even going quite far back in time. I have a G27 racing wheel. In Forza Horizon 4,  all pedals are mixed up - break pedal accelerates, accelerator pedal brakes, clutch pedal does not work at all. The worst thing is the steering wheel force feedback is reversed. I.e. when you turn, the wheel is fighting you trying to increase the steering angle, which makes it completely undrivable. I've seen tons of complaints about this issue. It seems that it is PC related. The good news - it is fixable. It can't be fixed via menu but if you unpack some game zip file, edit XML configuration file for your wheel and repack it back to the zip file - you can get this to work...  But come on! Doing this sort of thing in a $60 game in 2023??? Seriously?

Also, there is no way to switch off some highly annoying music (radio) from the game settings menu... Imagine this - you can change the radio volume from 10 down to...  1! Which means that it will still be annoying you, you can't shut it off completely at all! Apparently, you are supposed to go to your car, and then flip ""radio channels"" until it says ""radio off""...  Who made this game? 

As you can expect after reading all this, none of the cut scenes (and there are a lot of them) are skippable. You have to sit and listen to some amazing plot (I'm very, very sarcastic) being slowly unraveled for you...

So, on the scale of 1-10, I would give it a solid 4, slightly less than glamorous 9.5 reviews that prompted me to purchase it...

Cheers!

The visuals are breathtaking and each week of the month Britain is different, due to changing seasons giving the world a fresh look. The game offers over 700 cars, lets you tune them and change the liveries as you want. Cars handling feels great, nowhere near Dirt Rally level obviously, but still pretty solid. Soundtrack is good, but I wish it had more songs as they get repetitive after a while. Throughout the world there are a lot of stuff to do; from races, to exploring sites and gathering collectibles, to drifting, hourly and weekly events, story-based challenges, crossover events like Halo, battle royale competitions etc. Also, community is pretty active, there are many people online even at 1-2am. Often, I launch the game just to cruise around while listening to music, it's relaxing.

There are some issues however.
[list]
    [*]Despite support team being responsive, devs failed to address Nvidia driver issues and broken achievements for a long time (they did fix the issues eventually). Problems like Explorer level 29 remain unfixed though.
    [*]FH4 has in-game credits (easy to earn 30-50M a month), but thankfully no microtransactions. However, certain DLCs (like Hot Wheel cars) are locked behind paywall, even for Ultimate edition owners who are supposed to get all content (or so I thought). Pretty greedy move.
    [*]Lego DLC is great, my little brother loves it. But, it has many grindy challenges and requires 100% completion to unlock the final race. It'd had been better if the whole world was made of Legos, kinda ruins the immersion.
    [*]Custom track design and blueprint is quite limited compared to FH5
    [*]Online multiplayer is absolutely dogshit. Sometimes it randomly disconnects, many times you are stuck at loading screen between races for 15-20mins. Singleplayer is a blast, but multiplayer is very frustrating.

Rating: ★★★★★

Forza Horizon 4 has taken the open-world racing genre and elevated it to an unprecedented level of excitement and entertainment. So much so, that I couldn't resist diving into its automotive wonderland not once, but twice! I initially purchased this masterpiece from the Microsoft Store, and when it finally graced the shelves of Steam, I didn't hesitate to add it to my collection once again.

From the very first rev of the engine to the heart-pounding finish line moments, Forza Horizon 4 is an absolute triumph. The meticulously crafted world of Britain, rendered with stunning detail and dynamic seasons, feels alive as you race through bustling cities, serene countrysides, and everything in between. The transition between seasons is nothing short of breathtaking, altering the driving experience and challenging your skills in ways you'd never expect.

The variety of cars available is a car enthusiast's dream come true. Whether you're tearing through a dirt trail in a rally car or hitting the asphalt in a hypercar, the handling and responsiveness are a testament to the developers' dedication to authenticity. The thrill of discovering and adding new cars to your garage is an addictive journey of its own, keeping you hooked on the pursuit of that perfect ride.

Multiplayer mode is where Forza Horizon 4 truly shines. The seamless integration of online and offline gameplay creates a dynamic social environment that's never short on adrenaline-fueled fun. Joining friends in the open world, participating in races, or tackling challenges together adds an immersive layer of camaraderie that keeps you coming back for more. The seasonal events and ever-evolving content ensure that there's always something new to experience.

As if the core game wasn't enough, the PC version on Steam brings additional benefits that only enhance the experience. From the ease of use to the familiar integration with the Steam ecosystem, it's an absolute joy to have Forza Horizon 4 in my Steam library.

In conclusion, Forza Horizon 4 is more than just a game; it's an automotive masterpiece that continues to captivate and enthrall players. The fact that I couldn't resist buying it twice, once on the Microsoft Store and then on Steam, speaks volumes about the game's quality and longevity. If you're a fan of racing games, or even if you're new to the genre, don't miss out on the chance to experience the unparalleled thrill of Forza Horizon 4. It's a journey worth taking, over and over again.",1662833762,1692313946,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Actually a 10/10 in terms of handling, music, graphics.

I would say though at some point in the beginning you will feel overwhelmed by the amount of information thrown at you, so take your time with it.

Then I play this...handling and visuals are fantastic. The array of cars is excellent. Not many games have an HSV Maloo, so it was fun to see that being from Austalia. That said, the story and progression are awful. Why I say that is because there's no real point to any of it, even beyond the pointless nature of games. I don't mean that as something existential, its stunning how they could make this with just a ""you finished that set of races...here's another set' sort of attitude. 

My map is now peppered with all these races with trophies on them. I'm playing on a Steamdeck, so I can just switch on and off at will, but I can't imagine playing this for 'a session' like I have with other games. Its mind-numbingly pointless, with no other objective other than to race. 

Grid legends and Grid, in contrast, had finish that set of races to get access to the next tier...but you could see the tier sets. This is purely 'surprise' more stuff and to no real end. 

Although that's bad  because it has no objective, if you like 'racing' its delivered with so much polish that most vistas are breathtaking. Upgrades are great, and you can feel the difference. As a 'driving game', purely for driving, I don't think they get much better than this. The controls are sillky smooth (except for some of thos S2 970 cars...I might just be terrible, but I can't control those to save my life). 

For me, that lack of progression just makes the desire to keep playing lacking (that brings the score down quite a bit - it just seems like the devs didn't care for that). Lots of modes though, with racing hovercrafts and the like...that was fun. I'd say its a solid 8/10. It could have been higher if there was focused progression though.

Overall the game it's outdated soo there's no new updates or new content, and the festival seasons are just repeating over and over again with same events and rewards.

Things I like:
  Graphics

  Variety of cars

  Extensive customization

  Levels where you have to try hard to complete them (like the one with Porsche in Top Gear series)

Things I hate:
  The game itself is repetitive, the stories are boring, I would prefer just the loading screen instead

  Some levels you have to just aim at the destination and push trough the trees and off-road 
  terrain to get 3 starts, it does not feel real, it does not keep me engaged

  Skill point levels are boring, you pretty much just smash trough stuff

  The support takes too much time to resolve bugs, the bug with constant freezing took over 6 
  months  to be fixed

The last one is the main reason why I do not recommend the game.",1679521963,1690663946,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

This is an exhilarating open-world racing game that completely blew away my expectations. From the moment I fired up the engine, I was captivated by the jaw-dropping graphics and seamless gameplay, creating an experience that made time disappear as I delved deeper into its virtual world.

Visually, Forza Horizon 4 sets a new standard for racing games. The meticulously designed landscapes are an absolute feast for the eyes, and the attention to detail is simply astonishing. From the lush greenery of the British countryside to the bustling streets of Edinburgh, every corner of this world feels alive and immersive. I found myself stopping on the side of the road just to admire the picturesque scenery, forgetting for a moment that I was supposed to be racing!

The range of cars available is equally impressive. With an extensive collection of vehicles to choose from, each with its own unique characteristics and handling, the game caters to every driving style. Whether I wanted to cruise through the city streets in a sleek supercar or take on off-road challenges with a rugged SUV, Forza Horizon 4 had me covered. The sense of progression and unlocking new cars as I advanced through the game was gratifying, keeping me motivated to explore further.

One of the standout features is the dynamic weather system, which adds an extra layer of challenge and excitement to the races. Navigating through rain, snow, and even thunderstorms not only tests your driving skills but also introduces a level of unpredictability that keeps each race fresh and thrilling. The day-night cycle further enhances the realism, making the world feel alive and ever-changing.

The gameplay in Forza Horizon 4 is smooth as silk. The controls are responsive, making even the most demanding maneuvers feel natural. The variety of events and activities available ensures there's never a dull moment. From traditional races to stunt challenges and everything in between, the game consistently delivers heart-pounding action and adrenaline-pumping excitement.

The online integration is seamless, allowing you to share the open-world experience with other players in real-time. Whether you choose to team up for cooperative challenges or compete head-to-head in adrenaline-fueled races, the multiplayer aspect extends the game's longevity and guarantees endless hours of fun.

While Forza Horizon 4 is not without its minor quirks, such as occasional AI oddities or minor glitches, they are easily overshadowed by the overwhelming positives that the game offers. Its vast and visually stunning world, combined with addictive gameplay, make it one of the best racing games I've ever played.

In conclusion, Forza Horizon 4 is an absolute must-have for racing enthusiasts and casual gamers alike. It offers a breathtakingly beautiful and immersive experience that will keep you coming back for more. Turn the key, buckle up, and get ready for an unforgettable journey through the virtual roads of Great Britain.",1690468377,1690468377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But, I decided to look the game from a different point of view.
I have never been a casual game player or sandbox racer fan to be exact. Always wanting to start as an underdog, and climb to the top. 
Since what I do in life for work is all the time since I have my own thing (freelance), I rarely get time to invest in gaming in general.
After spending a couple of relaxing hours, started looking at Horizon from a more positive angle.
Really enjoying the time I spend on it.

150 hrs in the end is stating to get in sight and slowly this creeping feeling starts to come in that now it's becoming a grind. Started playing some PVP and all of a sudden I started hating it.

Small mistakes like bumping into a wall are met with a slow down penalty - I'm slowed down already by the accident I'm involved in and the game goes on adding 10 seconds of you moving to a crawling 50mph.

200hrs most achievements are done. Nothing else is being announced. The late game shrouded in a saddening silence. And then the kicker - after all those hours you realise that the game is broken. It cannot be completed. I've checked the developers notes for known bugs. The page is 6 months old https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360001991068-FH4-Known-Issues

The current players have little to no hope that the game will be fixed ever, shunning Microsoft for lack of care for a game that is still sold a full price 4/5 years later. I was lucky enough to get it on a sale period. Abandonment of this game is eminent. The current announcements are now on a loop. There isn't any more involvement of the MS team caring for the game.

250hrs enjoying the last few crumbs of what is left to do. The superstar cards needed a bit of polishing, but it is evident now that the players don't care enough to get that far either. I've spent hours driving about whilst waiting for a Ranked drift adventure, never happened. The creative card is a poor attempt at sharing new creations. Good idea in concept - but a rapidly ageing one. Now its just a grind fest of sharing and unsharing pictures, car mods, liveries, and blue print tracks. Its not racing any more. I'd rather go do unpaid overtime work than this.

Its a shame. This game and its community have been let down so drily, unceremoniously, abandoned, as MS develops the next money grabbing title. The game is worth while, but the late game part is just disappointing. I, like many others will get stuck at 99% achievement completion. It is ironically fitting that the last achievement is called 'Encore?' with  a question mark, because I think I know the answer for that one. 

No

There won't be

Edit: The 'FH4 Known Issues' page has been updated with the following remark: ""Latest Nvidia driver causing game to Freeze/Crash (updating to studio driver or rolling back driver solves this issue) [12.1.22] Nvidia Drivers"" - Meaning you can't play the game properly unless you have old Nvidia Drivers. Wonderful, just wonderful

Edit2: An update fix has been announced on the 7th of March 2023, that on the 60th Series the Encore Achievement will be functioning as it should. In lieu of this announcement I have downloaded the game again to test out if it is possible to play. The game remains unplayable for Steam buyers that own 30 or 40 Series Nvidia Cards, with forums still recommending downgrading the GPU driver to V522.25 - a 5 month old driver. At the date of writing, my GPU driver is V531.18 which is recommended by most games. This game will still keep its thumbs down vote

Edit 3: I'm at about 700 hrs and I feel it is time to call it here. The game has had its major issues fixed since my last update and I've enjoyed the time I did in this game. It is worth the grind of getting better at the game , get ridiculously rich, get some rival times, customise, and expand you collection of cars. It's fun but I stand firmly that the first 100 hrs are the best ones. At 250 hrs you're at the endgame and probably getting the Encore achievement. I've pushed to 700 hrs because its and easy casual game, but I'm stopping now as there isn't much else to do other then to push further on records or getting more money. All in all it is worth buying the game - there are still some broken features but nothing that will compromise the over all gaming experience. For me this game earns a 7.5/10.",1669233066,1690397812,True,0,0,0.529042363166809082,0,True,False,False

- A nice highlight is there are lots of cars.
cons
- Muted the music
- its ""career"" tasks / missions are cringey
- the UI is terrible. 
-  I just couldnt get force feedback set well enough that I could tell when you car loose grip.

Beautifully made racing game set in Scotland. You can race from the city of Edinburgh to the beaches outside Bamburgh castle upto the Glenfinnan mountains in the North at 170mph+ through Spring, Summer, Autumn & Winter with hundreds of cars to collect, tune, paint and modify to your liking, as well as having hundreds of races and events to take part in either offline or online. Also I'd recommend checking out the Fortune Island and Lego racer dlc packs for some extra content and locations to travel to.",1689919304,1689919304,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Constantly freezes up and or crashes sometimes after 15 minutes sometimes after an hour.  Doesn't appear to be a resource issue since I've thrown more than the recommended CPU, Memory, and GPU at it.  Found multiple entries in event viewer and not always consistent,  There is a huge amount of information about issues with this game on PC but solutions are all over the board.  Very frustrating.

Update - Finally decided to go ahead and load older nvidia driver v.522.25 as some have recommended...and Forza 4 has become stable.

Now - I see a new patch was released on April 4 to correct this driver issue....not sure I'm ready to try changing the driver again just yet.  I'm just starting to enjoy Forza 4.

Have been enjoying the level of detail in this simulation and have changed my rating to Recommended.  I still have yet to load the latest nvidia driver though...UPDATE...

Have been running newer versions (currently 535.98) and Forza 4 has been very stable.  Thank you Microsoft.

Their solution was to downgrade to the 522 drivers - why the fuck should anyone do this? The devs seem to live in a world where they think people use their PCs to only play one game that is Horizon 4. 

The fact that they haven't come out with a patch or anything to address this issue makes me NOT want to recommend the game in its current state to anyone with nVidia cards.

This is my favorite Forza for the setting, but the devs have successfully convinced me to hate this game.",1678898533,1689692029,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
