Pros-

#1.The game itself might have been cool when it was more populated?

#2.The game is free now



Cons-

#1.Pay to win

#2.Player base is dead


The Bottom Line -

Even if you were a pay to play/win player I still would pick something else.Pass on this.


Buy/try this game bellow it is much better for skirmish castle building.

Once they released it on steam it opened the flood gates to heavy cheating like botting, modified clients, etc.  

The current state of the game is that only 2 types of people can survive and enjoy it.
(1) heavy carders.  I would estimate $100-150 a month to keep pace.
(2) multiple accounts and the use of botting as the alternative.  It reduces amount of cards you buy

Second, Join a faction. Preferably one with a house. They are always in need of 'farmer' players who basically enjoy the simulation aspect of the game rather than the pvp.

     This game is P2W and rewarding for those with lots of money and time to spend.

LONG VERSION:
     If you have time and a lot of money go and play it. Like the older Stronghold games, it is fun and nostalgic. The beginning phase is the only thing that is fun about the game though. The game offers a lot of potential allowing you to develop villages and castle defenses and seeking out resources via scouting/harvesting. But that is where the similarities to the older games end and the bad mechanics come into play.

YOU WILL HIT A PAY WALL.

     Once you run out of the starter cards EVERYTHING will slow tremendously. You do get free card packs over time but it is not enough to compete with P2W players. Even worse, P2W players use their influence(money) to buy fast track card/troop packs to overrun whole regions single-handedly. You can try and just be casually/economically minded building more villages for trade and resources (like I tried) and not participate in the wars. BUT you will get involved one way or the other.

     If you don't align yourself with the dominating house, or even if you stay neutral, then you basically get ransacked and decimated 24/7, sometimes even after your starting shield is depleted. The servers progress through time intervals called Ages and whichever House controls more regions wins that server after the Ages end. Fast-track cards are only good for the server they are bought on and cannot be used on multiple servers. This forces you to buy multiple iterations of the same packs for new servers. After a House wins the last Age, the server resets which erases hours of progress/research, causes the player to start fresh, and restarts the slow progression of building villages which brings back the pay wall. This game can be played for free but, as mentioned, if you want to compete in any way you will be forced to pay real money for cards that are only good for one server at a time. It would be slightly better if you had a pool of cards you bought that could be utilized on other servers but sadly this is not the case. This game forces F2P players to become P2W, and even then, the victor is the one with more time and deeper pockets.",1527557723,1560579273,False,6,0,0.60501408576965332,0,True,False,False

The game centers around building and protecting villages. They can be attacked by other players and the AI. That may seem like a really simplistic view of the game, but that's the core. There is not much else to it than that. Every action a player takes is for their village. There are some interesting upgrades players can get through research and buildings, but it all takes time. For me, that is what this game boiled down to. Time. A big ol' swirling drain full of time. Players can pay to accelerate the process, but why bother? The rewards are simply not worth the time required. 

TL;DR - Takes too much time to do anything.

When you maxed characters and run all the content that other MMO's offer in the first year, you will find that time in Stronghold Kingdoms is just scratching the surface. The server you play may be coming close to its conclusion of the 1st AGE after 1 year of play and rewarding the players who won that age but the game is far from over.

There are 7 ages to the server and you carry everything you have attained into the following ages (gold, research , villages , faith points , honor). A server will on average take between 5 to 7 years to complete with great rewards in the end for those who played it through

With the 100's of ways to play , you will be left wanting to do it all over again with what you learned. 

Most surprising is the number of women who play the game and I have known 3 who held the highest seats of power in the game, House Marshal. Leading 100's of players to age victories

My only complaint is the graphics are dated, but proof if you have a product with years of playability and a community where you meet players from all over the world forming life long friendships the player base will stay and grow.

When I experienced what I thought was a bug in the game and sent in the report and explained what I did to resolve it, they sent me a generic message asking me to explain the issue more and explain what I did to resolve it. I had to remessage and explain I already did that (meaning ... they didn't even bother to read the first message).

Update: I had another ""bug"" issue to contact support about. I received a generic reply and they said they could ""discern no error,"" even after I submitted screen shots of the reports and pointed out what happened.

I see innovation here - a lot of it. I see opportunities to play stronghold like never before, with an MMO idea all taking place on a large map where cooperation and diplomacy are key to victory in the world of thousands of players all with their own individual strongholds they too are building. The game still has all the customization that stronghold offered you as well, placing the walls, towers, gatehouses, moats, spikes, and more all wherever you want to. It also gives you the freedom to train and manually deploy your own troops both defensively in your castle and/or offensively to siege another. In fact, at the time I began testing this game and for some time afterwards, it was unbelievably fun. But since then it's been squashed into a payment-heavy hunk of crap. 

""Cards"" in the game are used to boost what you can do with no limit to how many you can use, as long as you can afford to spend real world money to get them. On top of that, you require to buy premium subscriptions just to play the game properly, or you'll be logging in every hour to do something when nothing queues up properly. Cards can be earned for free, yes, but they take a long time and are fully randomized. You can earn more for free per week, but that is locked behind not one, but TWO paywalls of buying subscriptions to the game. You must buy TWO subscription tokens in order to unlock the full range of cards. On top of that, cards can still be bought with REAL WORLD MONEY after you ALREADY had to spend REAL WORLD MONEY on buying a PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION just to play the game properly. This is massively unbalanced and, as is common among MOBILE COW CLICKERS, can take you from the bottom of the pack to #1 on the leaderboard in a matter of minutes should you pay enough money. Nobody will, but the fact that it is a possibility means the game is massively unbalanced. Any game that makes it possible to advance from bottom to top within minutes cannot be considered free to play.

Outside of that, the game itself is barebones. Your castle management becomes minimal, as the tiny map areas and massively limited resources for each ""village"" means you will not be able to customize the village to look as you please, it's going to have to run for maximum efficiency, followed by waiting through timers and resource walls as you wait for enough resources or an open queue slot to continue. This game also has an issue of expansion, due to the extreme number of players - castles/villages can only be built on predetermined slots, and the number of people in the game makes it very difficult to expand peacefully without spending an absolute fortune of gold and leaving your new towns well outside your support range. Production lines are also removed now, with the only actual production being from wood/iron -> weapons. That's it. All other production chains, no matter how simple, have been ditched. To help slow you down, each time you build something, it raises its own construction cost and also increases the time required to build the next structure. So, don't go too fast - buy our shit instead!

This game offers so much room for innovation in the stronghold series. It makes me want to see a stronghold game taking place on a large meta-map managing multiple castles against various AI opponents or players doing similar things, but not in this fashion. I want to see it in a microtransaction-free, upfront paid game with no multi-day timers or subsctipitions or bullshit like that. This franchise NEEDS innovation, and the ideas behind stronghold kingdoms if applied to a paid game could provide it. But this just isn't it. All it does is makes you want to go play another stronghold game instead.

Before I begin, I would like to point out the major problem I have with most ""free to play"" games, Well, two.

1. They suck
2. They seem to all be based of the ""Farmvile Forumla""

Do not get me wrong, there are plenty of Free to Play games that do not do that, like Tribes Ascend, Star Trek Online after the F2P conversion, and a few others that operate on the concept of ""Pay because you're having fun and want to support it."" not ""Pay because you have to."" Those games are fine. Hell, I enjoy playing STO still, even after the F2P change.

Stronghold Kingdoms, on the other hand..is a medival reincarnation of Farmvile, but even more hands off! I came into the game expecting a cut-down version of Stronghold, but what I got out of it was pretty much like the fabled ""Age of Empires Online"".

When you're put into the game, you're given a basic tutorial, and some things to help. Sadly, it's not much (unless you preordered Crusader 2, or bought the starter pack for some reason), and even if you manage to make do, it's only a matter of time before you run into some barrier, like lack of resources or even not having enough gold. When that happens, you either have to bug your friends, making them hate your guts forevermore, or get your credit card and pay up, which, again, seem very much like the Facebook games we're all spammed with.

So then, would I reccomend this game? Are you joking?!  It makes me worry for the future of a decent series, being all pay to win and such.",1411262751,1411262751,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is my first review.
  At first I was disappointed becasue my named got changed from Sesshomaru to Sesshoomaru. After playing almost two years now I got used to my name and even my friends call me Sess now days. 
  This game is a fun game to sit down and play during a long day at work or school. You really do feel like you are a Lord ruling over your own villages in a bigger empire picture with all the other Lords and Ladys and helping your fellow players along the way.  In this game is where you can met people all over the world and you can help each other out. You can work together and fight together and its also great way to play with your friends too. 
  I also like how Stronghold has added more quest to to earn cards and wheel spins. Good job! I think it would be cool if Stronghold have automonks to send out cure disease or even bless of your own parishes. How about away to save you village like the way you save your castle? So all and all I have fun playing and excited about what new upgrades will come out next. 
 Here is helpful tip, When its say ""steam needs to be online"" which steam is online, well don't threat do I as do.  Right click on the mini steam icon in the task bar and click on stronghold and play. I hope that helps if it dose leave me a thumbs up!

The game get's quite indepth, especially when you add the interaction with other players, factions or houses. Takes up a lot of time to get really into it, so no casuals here! Still, it is a fun game and it's a throwback to the original in terms of looks. WOuld recommend for anyone looking a new game to put hours into =)

Do I reccomend this game?

Well if you want to forget about sleeping properly, going out on the lash or spending a day at work without a laptop for lunch time use then I do heartilly reccomend this game.

Cards (Pay real cash for) are a big part of the game as are 'Premium Tokens' ti gain a build queue, research queue and a few snacky features.

It's not a game for 'going it Alone'. Join a faction, your faction joins a house and your leadership (or you after a while if you want to get there) can decide who to befriend and who to attack.

With over 1500 hours invested on and off over the past couple of years it's IMHO a great way of thinking you will log in for a quick 20m to have a checkup at 7 in the evening and then think oh **** its 1am and im up in 5 hours for work

But they have missed a key point, its a free game. The creators need to make money off it some way. Now, i have just under 400 hours on this game and ive spent hardly anything on it. Im currently fighting a war in my houses honour in am having a lot of fun doing it. This game is slow paced making it a non-rage game for all the gamers out there who know what im talking about. There are a lot of friendly people on it that i have met making it one of the better communties out there in my opinion.  Give it a bash! Build your village up and have fun doing it! Hope this tad insight helps, I may have just rambled on!

Chose to fight for domination for your house on many different servers ( Worlds ) or play peacefully and build up your villages.

If you chose to make powerful allies or devious enemies, there will always be plenty of action in this game no matter what world you chose to play on.

Along with building up your villages you get the opportunity to run for sheriffship of your county, being the Governor of your province, or even King of the country! So there is always lots of competition ingame.

Do not play if your senstive for gambling, only go for it if you time to spare during breaks and do not mind losing to some of the worst people on the this earth. The speed at first is pretty good and progress is fast but it quickly slows down thats when its dangerous to get sucked into buying cards. They help but not that mutch. 

Also do not think devs will improve/change the game mutch the game is essentialy the same as when they launched it.

Can be fun if your with a big groups and the concept of one huge map is awsome!
