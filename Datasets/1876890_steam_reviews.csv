edit: 100hrs; took my time to explore the map and beat up everyone i could but I still seem to be missing some side story-lines. main story was really well written from start to finish.

Pros- Very good concept on cultivation instead of leveling, you consult other npc for techniques build affinity, never seen a game which have this kinda system. I would say they had 100% originality on this game. 

Cons - Main story is abit short, will wait for their future roadmap on story expansion to comment much, characters interactions are limited, Non of the storyline characters actually join you permantly, they have side characters to join you instead but you have to complete their quest. I would say the storyline was good, however the main character have little interactions with the potential female love interest, and some npc characters art looks amazing however you can't play as them, maybe a recruitment button like OTP traveler to ask them to follow you would be good. hope that the female leads actually follow the main character more.

10/10 will spend on dlc or a prequel/sequel to this game.

The lvling up of your characters is a little different than traditional RPG's and I have seen a few people complain about it but I thought it was really cool actually.  Instead of just getting XP and each lvl your stats go up a little you gain martial points.

Martial points can then be used to upgrade your moves and abilities up to lvl 10.  Each lvl adds power to your skill and most skills have key lvls, usually lvl 5 and 10 that add more utility to the move/ability.  You also have 5 categories of moves.  Normal/Special/Mighty/Unique/Lightness/Cultivation.

The first 4 are different attacks with a lot of different effects, normal attacks being the weakest and unique attacks being the strongest.  Each category also has different power lvls of moves.  

For example white moves are the weakest, then blue, then yellow, then orange, and lastly red being the most powerful.

Lightness moves arent generally attacks although a couple do some damage, but are more for speeding up your movement around the battlefield and also increasing the rate of your Qi replenishment which basically decides how quickly you can perform your next attack.  

Cultivation styles have a variety of abilities, some do damage, some heal you, some do both, and some buff your characters in a variety of ways.  They also reward you with cultivation points each time you lvl one of them up that can be used to gain extra skill points and abilities on several different skill trees.  The skill trees are really how you make your characters stronger.

You can get cultivation techniques through a variety of ways, at key points in the story some are given to you and others you will need to get reputation with masters of other factions and buy them with martial points.  Some have skills books on them and you can spar them to get them as well.

Wandering Sword has a lot of different characters to collect, some of them having very specific things you need to do in order to recruit them and if you go to far sometimes certain characters will be unable to be recruited if you don't do so in time.

The story is basically like the stories in the old kung fu movies, young martial artist is looking to become the most powerful fighter in the world so that they can protect those they love and prevent tragedies from occuring they have previously suffered through.

The game has been translated from Chinese and occasionally the text doesn't read the way the average english speaker would verbalize something but only occasionally and I never had a problem understanding what was going on/being said.  Just some sentences worded a little strangly.

The story is pretty decent and most of the characters are pretty cool with interesting character specific quest lines etc.  You can only control 5 characters at a time and by the end you will probably choose certain ones that are your favorites and wont touch the others much other than to fulfill their quest lines.

The world is pretty big with lots to explore and loot to find.

The main page says you can beat the game in about 20 hours, but my first play through was almost 100 hours.  I completed probably about 80-90 percent of all side quests in addition to the main quest line and I did some grinding to lvl my rep with other factions and get the most powerful moves.  I only missed recruiting one character.

There is also crafting of weapons, armor, trinkets, and cooking and alchemy to make food that restores HP/MP and a few that provide buffs.  Alchemy makes a lot of items that give small permanent increases to a variety of stats like HP/MP, atk, crit, evasion, etc.

If you enjoy old school turn based RPG's with a cool story, lots of characters to collect, and you also like martial arts/kung fu movies you will love this game.  

Its still technically in early access and devs are adding more to the main story line and companion quest lines as well as a new game+ mode.  I am excited to give the new game+ mode a try and try to get 100% completion next time and get the few gear recipes I missed, and the companion I missed as well.

Pro:
1) Interesting concept. Looks like Octopath Traveller with distinct chinese characteristics on a semi open world map. Played with Chinese Language (I recommend this if you understand Chinese).
2) Story is ok. There are 3 major side quest which has pretty good story. There are recruitable characters with their own quest and some of them are interesting. The main story line can be better though.
3) Replayabe because it has multiple endings depending on your interactions. It is open world so it is also possible for you to miss some side quest.

Con:
1) The combat is simple and the swarm of enemy can be tedious (if you are strong enough you can go auto combat or just run around them but still waste alot of time). They can make it more challenging.
2) It can be grinding game if you choose to (which i did) 
3) Some of the side jobs (fishing, collecting ingredients, making elixir/potions, cooking, making weapons and accessories) dont really bring much value. The elixir and weapon making makes you stronger
so that is worth it but it is pretty tedious
4) The main character is pretty bland. You are pretty much forced to be a nice guy throughout the game. There is nothing wrong with it of course but other games I played adds
more depth to the main character and flexibility to moral choices you can make. 

Summary: It is worth buying because it is cheaper than most games and it has an interesting concept. 
I read some review which was critical of the fact that the game involves alot of reading but in my opinion that is not a fair critic. This is how the game tells its story. That reviewer probably played the english version which I have no idea how the translation is going to bring the story justice.
I will give it higher grades if the main story is more interesting. (Tales of Wuxia 侠克风云穿 and Path of Wuxia 侠之道 have better story)",1706452310,1706452310,True,3,0,0.546591520309448242,0,True,False,False

Like you have some serious beat of potential drama or character growth, but it's again shrugged off in 2 text boxes. The main character isn't questioning anything, just taking everything for face value, nobody got solid traits that would have developed through the backstory of intense conflict. It destroys immersion and really doesn't make me feel like I or the characters belong in that place or period.

Then you have so many different names and locations introduced, that I'm just finding I skip over a lot of the dialogue with NPCs. All of them give me a sidequests really early on, but I can not even leave town yet to do them. So hell knows how I'm gonna remember any of those later on.

The combat... doesn't encourage me to continue playing either.

Improvements can be made but I had a great time for the first play through, was at Unrivaled with full forged class 2 equipment. The story line is pretty good IMO, simple yet captivating. The fact that they added random characters walking around the world map and towns, whom you can speak and trade with, shows their effort in making the game immersive. Many team members to recruit, most of which had background stories and quests to expand and work on. Looking forward to future content and definitely would recommend playing.

Likes
- story line was simple yet interesting and not convoluted
- allows you to develop at your own pace and explore
- open world so you can travel to high level areas and get killed by a tiger with 3K HP early
- decent amount of side quests
- background stories and quests of team members
- wuxia music is actually pretty good
- great art
- decent selection of martial arts

Improvements, mostly minor gripes
- music can get repetitive
- no new game+ or allowing you to continue playing after the final boss (as of writing)
- slight imbalance in martial arts where other weapons aside from swordplay are not powerful enough
- slight imbalance in difficulty for some sections but not deal breaking
- mounts for world map, I'd like a legendary qilin, or at least a horse please
- world map can be bigger
- animation for martial arts in battles can be better, some seem to be random flashes of lights

Initial world building is nice. Settings are really nice to look at. Start from zero become the hero.

剧情上，平淡的线性流程与有限的选择，再加上灌水严重的主线流程，让人并没有特别多的耐心去完整地品读每一个角色的立场与所思所感。写这个评论的时候我并没有玩完该作，但是已经处在一个中后期开始灌水的时候了。相比主线，支线剧情确实更加丰富和饱满，但是糟糕的玩法和偏固化的流程也确实无法让我真心地给个好评。
玩法上，粗糙的战棋机制和有限的功法流派把战斗的冗长和琐碎展现的淋漓尽致。比较有趣的一点是升级体系，不同于以往的等级制，该作使用了经脉+内功这样的方式，确实让人眼前一亮。不过这个带来的问题就是人物并没有办法有效地享受刷级碾压的快感。要想打碾压，整个流程从以前的打怪升级变为了现在的找人切磋拿经脉丹、推主线找好内功。怎么说呢，感觉确实战力断层严重，从一开始的谁都打不过，到突然某个点，你送礼门槛高了，把易筋经拿到了，好的绝式也拿到了，你基本就横着走了。这个战力升级的非线性私以为是有些不合理的。
好比老早以前的智冠天龙八部加强版，在苏州遇鸠摩智结束之后就能把全游最强的两个武功学完了，整个后续玩起来就很没意思。但是好歹天龙八部有剧情兜底，本作很难去碰瓷。
一个好的游戏作品、或是在剧情、或是在玩法上应该有一个比较突出的点。可以在剧情上给出一个比较深刻的结局、对现实比较艺术的映射；也可以在玩法上展现一个沉浸式的代入、成长性和自由度极高的选项。但是可惜的是，这两者在该作上体现的都不太明显。遗憾地讲，我可以玩100小时的大侠立志传而完全感觉不到腻味，该作我玩个20小时就已经开始想快速通关结束这段略显折磨的旅程了。
当然，该作让人眼前一亮的点是这个类“八分旅人”的画风和美术，个人感觉还是相当不错的。
最后想说明一点，我的不推荐并非是不支持国产武侠游戏，只是看到这样的作品能有这样的分数和评价还是会很诧异，现在大家对于武侠游戏的要求已经这么低了吗？",1703227033,1703227033,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I'm very much into reading Wuxia/Xianxia novels and this is my first time actually playing this type of 'murim' 'jianghu' themed type game. Ah and Spoiler warning for the story and plot, don't read if you don't want to be spoiled for the story. (basically to me this game feels as though i'm ""reading a murim / wuxia novel"" with a start and end with a bit of content but feels lackluster in  some parts / unfinished and still needs alot of extra things?) 

I find the Stamina bar a bit of a nuisance when gathering resources and I'm a bit of a hoarder so I refused to use pills to recover so I basically ran back to the starting area / inn to recover my Stamina and HP/MP repeatedly. (personal thing but add the option to change who is following you on screen, it's a big hassle to change who is following you and I simply cannot be bothered to unparty and run back to the location that party member is)

Remember to manually save several times, my game from start to finish in my first run crashed about 4-5 times and auto-saves are random, so if you happen to die while farming enemies for a long time your last auto-save might be from 30m-1hr ago.. happened once to me so I made sure to always save after fighting a few enemies or before story decisions. 

In the game the NPCs seem to acknowledge you as a Swordsman despite me making the player character a Fist weapon user the entire time (yeah i get Wudang is typically known as the taiji sword sect but my character exclusively used the Fist the entire time), maybe have something done about that?

Something that disappoints me is that despite there being an abundance of plumblossom trees everywhere, there isn't a single ""plumblossom sword/fist/weapon/cultivation technique"" anywhere nor any Mount Hua sect (Mount Hua Sect and Plumblossom sword arts are in the majority of murim martial art novels).. instead for some strange reason there exists this stupid Tianjian Sect area that has quite literally 0 relevance to the story and (aside from easy to miss minor mentions) seems to exist as cut forgotten content or future DLC expansion. 
Oh yeah you may as well rename the Xuanhao Cult as ""Demonic Cult"" or sacred flame cult (heavenly demon cult?), it's very obvious they're meant to be the demonic cult from wuxia novels with the whole ""Sacred Flame Worship Religion"" and them being opposed to the Orthodox Sects of the Central Plains, surprised their sect leader wasn't titled ""Heavenly Demon"". 

The plot/story is pretty linear. MC gets caught in an ambush, gets saved and then owes a debt to the master who took him in, the master dies from old enemies and entrusts his young daughter to Yuwen Yi (MC), daughter gets taken by her mother's sect and Yuwen tries finding his master's daughter Xiaotong, that is his main goal in (other than revenge against the gang that ambushed him and killed his friends) the entire game and even then Xiaotong is literally neglected until around the last few acts. 

Regarding the Main Character Yuwen Yi, give an explanation as to why he gains strength at an accelerated rate beyond old renowned martial artists, him simply having the Wind and Cloud Cultivation Method is partly why he's so strong but simply having an immensely strong cultivation technique isn't going to cut it, just how long has he been amassing Qi? 
He also technically learns and masters martial arts near instantly and having that renowned cultivation method isn't an explanation to that, at least give the excuse he has the ""heavenly martial physique"" that typically appears in wuxia novels as a reason why he's so innately talented and learns/grows at an extreme accelerated rate along with the WindCloudMethod. 
I especially hate the forced lose story cutscenes in battle when I was clearly thrashing the enemy.. 

It also seems that there was originally going to be something with Yuwen's lineage as his Uncle seemed to have been a retired strong martial artist with ties to Mingjian manor and his Father had a 'strong temper' like Yuwen but his Uncle supposedly ""dies"" off-screen to the tianlong gang which is very suspicous, even if Yaoji did find his Gourd bottle that never left his body in the remains of Yuwen's home that still isn't his corpse so he's very likely alive but unseen, seems like future content updates or DLC will bring this up. 

Let the MC use Qinggong / Lightness arts more often, technically he should be able to run at superhuman extreme speeds and jump buildings but aside from a small select cutscenes literally everyone else is running away with Lightness arts from the MC and he has to simply 'run' after them, why have these weird fast-travel areas with a cart driver when MC can run far faster than any horse.

I did a second playthrough (still with Fist because although it has the shortest range, later that gets fixed and is the strongest of the 5 weapon types) because I saw I had missed some extra content with Di Zui and the strange enigmatic psychopath monk Kama, to go on this path you need to have all the companions you can get in your party (In the first playthrough i couldn't go after Kama since I had failed with Chen Lenxi dead), I'm annoyed even after I went out of my way to do everything to get Di Zui I couldn't kill Kama and get new cultivation techniques.. 

Let me max out my meridian wheel, even in the second playthrough I couldn't max out my meridian wheel with all the cultivation methods (I was still very strong though, easily thrashing all the enemies) and could only max out about 4 meridian paths despite hogging all the meridian pills to Yuwen and sparring with every NPC that had a meridian pill to give. I really hope there wasn't any secret cultivation methods that could be obtained as a rare drop from certain enemies or fishing with those mystery boxes.. if there were secret cultivation methods you could get with fishing or farming certain enemies someone tell me.(I never lost a fight in story battles in the first or second playthrough)

Thats about it, simply put this game to me is ok but It needs a good bit of extra content and story to make it great, make the companions more involved with the story as it's very odd the main story excludes them yet includes them in the battle parts.",1701240517,1703155816,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mostly.
On one hand, this game feels like a AA accomplishment, setting the bar at an acceptably ambitious level and doing a lot to get there. The art is great, the premise is fun, combat is reactive and generally moves fast, and the systems at work are easy to get into, no Asian levels of grind required. Quests are even helpfully outlined in your journal on where to go for what you need and who to take it to once you have. The story's nothing special, but nothing terrible either. The high, low and predictable points are all there without wasting too much of your time - there's a lot of game here to enjoy.
Where this title falls short is in the characters and the quests around them. There are a handful of people you'll always have with you, some plot-specific side characters, and a bunch (around 15) of optional people you can/will recruit along the way. That last group is the issue. You see, there are five weapon styles you can train your main character in, and each of the recruitable characters specializes in one of them. Problem is, there's so little variation or uniqueness to these characters that once you train up one person with any weapon - usually your earliest recruit - there's no reason to switch out to the others aside from a few moves here and there. Lots of their techniques are learned from books, which means that everyone learns 85% of their abilities from the same source, and without those unique traits, why bother levelling up my third sword user when I have two already? Exactly right, dear reader - there's no reason to.
This stings with the interesting characters you meet and recruit, too. A bandit on the path of redemption, a sword master who left his own school, an unarmed combatant afflicted with a frail ego, there's lots of meat on the bone for character development, but outside of the quest to get these guys, you'll almost never hear them speak. Not with small stuff, and definitely not at major plot events. Whole plot threads dry up with these side characters once their part is played, and having beaten the game, I can confirm that not one of them gets an epilogue scene or a send off after all the time they spent working with you. No conclusion to their desires and drives, no snapshot on where they ended up, just enough to show us the major girls and our leading man and that's it. Calling it a waste of potential doesn't come close to covering how much is lost with this.
Now, the devs have posted that they plan on expanding the side characters in a future update, and I hope that's true. That would be worth a fresh playthrough if it proved worth it, because the more guys I got, the more I realized how little it mattered. And that's not a good feeling.
This ties into the side characters as a complaint - there's a LOT you can/will miss if you don't have a walkthrough. I like this approach generally since it shows the flexibility of the story and writing, but when the signal to go back to a certain place you'd have no reason to explore is a line of throwaway dialogue, that's getting a little too obscure. Even major characters have stuff that seems to be handled off screen, or have side material that isn't referenced again, leaving it ambiguous as to what its significance was or whether it was worth remembering. And that's a disservice to the characters and the plots they're involved in, because that side stuff is really interesting.
Aside from that, though, this was a good use of my time. The fun parts were worth it, the hard parts kept me coming back, and nothing was so oblique or infuriating that I couldn't work out the way forward, striking that balance between difficulty and accessibility.

You get a lot of points for having a different soundtrack for exploring, each city, etc., but when I have to hear the same SUPER-DRAGONBALL-ACTION-GO song 30-second loop at least 3 times for each of 12+ battles [I'm in the bandit mountain rescuing the kids now] it gets old suuuuper fast.

The story is fun, and I'm enjoying it. I like how for herbs they're using the Chinese names like gan cao and bai zhi instead of licorice and angelica, and I'm picking up on things like XuanHuo being 玄火 for like summon-fire and WuXian being 无限 for unlimited, so that's a big plus for a Western guy with a little interest in the language.

I'm dicking my way through a qigong course right now, and actually bought this game after searching ""Meridians"" on steam to try and help my edification, kind of like I did with the ""five elements"" game to learn the 五行 relationships, so I'm excited to look at all those accupoints individually.

Early on,  I've got to say, after 6-7 of the exact same snake battle in the cave, the battles were a big let down, although they're getting better as there are more enemies. Consider these games though:

Age of Decadence
War Tales
Colony Ship
Shadowrun games
Wasteland 1/2
Wartales
Encased
Pathfinder
Expedtitions Vikings
DoS2
Atom RPG

What do all of these games in my library have in common this game is lacking though?

TERRAIN!!

Every battle is like an open chessboard so far! No trees, no rocks, not even something in Vikings like the occasional patch of mud or ice.

For the battles-I don't even know if there's a resolution possible, since they're certainly not going to handcraft each battle field, but you'd think there'd be some way to jumble up the battles at least a little with some AI-placed debris or mud. Even a log to break up the battlefield to move behind and force enemies to path around would be a massive improvement, like you might see in Atom

I'm definitely going to keep playing and I could be saying this too soon after a mere couple of hours, and I'll come back and update soon [note:I did update to include why I hate the battle music], but I did want to call this out right away.

Every single one of those games above I mentioned, I remember the first battle/s and there was more variety right from the get-go, be it Wasteland 2's fight with the spider walker and then the various Dorseys including cover, exploding barrels, charging up abilities, or be it Wartales' ability to ""place"" your units on the field before the battle started, allowing you to at least choose a sort of formation, or even just the halls and corridors of the Aldori Mansion in Pathfinder. I'll straight up admit I know none of those I mentioned have AI-generated terrain battlefields, but I believe there were a variety of templates used for random encounters (Wartales, Pathfinder, Expeditions) and it seems like it wouldn't be out of specs to design 20-30 more interesting battlefields and have you spawn on a random one for the repetitive encounters.

Game's beautiful, but the battlefields are so bland....maybe this changes later but like I said everything so far was just 100% open spaces, fixed starting positions, and no terrain effects/variety. And that 30-second loop for the battle music is already too much.

Leaving comments open in case anyone wants to concur/disagree or has better insight into the game design process than I do on why some semi-random battlefields would/wouldn't work. I hope I hear some agreement on there needing to be more than one battle song though. I'm worried I've got a hundred songs for half the game then one 30-second battle song for the other half the time I'm playing",1702744145,1702767437,False,1,0,0.491869926452636719,0,True,False,False

The best part is the start, where you can slowly build your repertoire of skills and optimizing your build to challenge more difficult scenarios, but past a certain point (and it can happen really, really, early,) you can pretty much start playing it as an idle rpg because the fights can get repetitive and you're so overpowered that never mind your comrades, your opponents might as well not exist given the speed you obliterate them.

Would still recommend, because it's exceedingly rare for the wuxia genre to be anywhere close to being competently made without a microtransaction model.

While there are a few lines that don't translate as well or a few instances that don't really give the impact that the original language would, the combat is fluid and rewarding and I've had a blast just wandering around the world, finding optional areas and enjoying the very rewarding cycle of power-leveling. It feels great to take constant steps forward and watch Yuwen Yi become a godly force.

Fans of FFT and Star Ocean will find a lot to love here in the ebb and flow of gameplay, especially fans of the latter. While Wandering Sword doesn't support job classes, the weapon arts do a lot for player expression and grinding is very easy with the autobattle and real-time toggle options. You also won't easily break the game as there's soft caps in techniques available via the number of skills and cultivation techniques you can learn at a given point in the story. I never felt weaker or stronger than the designer seemingly intended, in a good way that shows a lot of time and effort was put into it.

I'd say that the only real drawbacks I experienced would be some early dialogue and pacing that started to tank my interest, but I was very pleasantly surprised after I left the starting village and I was hooked once I figured out the sparring system.

8.5/10, very well worth your time as a tactical RPG fan.

Obviously the story arch type is a classic one based on the timeless dilemma of ""Does the ends justify the means."".   However this classic arch type is done with a Chinese twist based on Chinese cultural sensitivities.  For those of you that are not Chinese it is a great window into the Chinese mind and introduces how Chinese people think about deep problems like ""Does the ends justify the means."".

If you don't get what I mean after playing the game let me explain.  The question of"" does the ends justify the means"" for a Chinese person really boils down to a different questions.  That is which value is superior, ""Survival"" or ""Morality"".   Here ""Survival"" equates with ""Ends"" and ""Morality"" equates with ""Means"".  Throughout the story we see all the characters struggle over this choice and we see them generally fall into 3 categories.  

One category is, QingXu's master.  He rejects the existence of a trade-off  between ""Survival"" and ""Morality"".  To him there is no difference between means and ends.  Everything is an end and he simply chooses the best end.  Of course this is a dishonest depiction of the classic dilemma.  Choosing this way of thinking is effectively the same as choosing to take ""Survival/Ends"" over ""Morality/Means"", just with a kinder rationalisation to delude oneself with.  (In Chinese culture this would be the ""Legalist"" way of thinking.  Although legalism can be even more direct and reject considerations for morality altogether)

Another category is Fu LongZi.  He views all the other great masters as hypocrites who chose ""Survival/Ends"" over ""Morality/Means"".  To him this contradicts the professed highest values of WuXia, which the other masters are always falsely promoting, and marks them as unequivocally evil.  (In Chinese culture this would be the idealistic ""Confucian"" way of thinking which is always held in high regard in Chinese literature.)

The last and most common category, are Qing Xu and most of the other great masters.  They see the tragedy of the choice between ""Survival/Ends"" and ""Morality/Means"".  Till their deaths they are conflicted and don't know what is the right choice. (In Chinese culture this would be the pragmatist ""Confucian"" way of thinking, which is the way sober Chinese intellectuals tend to side with.)

The story doesn't really give an answer to this classic question, nor does one really exist.  However it shows you some of the different ways that Chinese culture deals with this question and what different positions exist on the view to this question in Chinese culture.",1701146624,1701146624,True,88,2,0.81617271900177002,0,True,False,False

总体来说，这是一个近年来难得一见的优秀武侠游戏，对于喜欢传统武侠风格的人，举双手推荐。

优点：
- 剧情优秀，有些人说后半段有点赶，我觉得还好。尤其是很多大型支线剧情，非常棒，建议千万不要错过。
- 对于角色的塑造有深度，没有过分脸谱化的人物，对于大多数人主线剧情出现的人物都很难用好人坏人来定义，体现了人性的复杂
- 战斗优化，打小兵用即时自动，打boss用回合手动，非常有创意且有效的玩法，弥补了传统武侠RPG练级的无聊，又能保证关键的战斗不会快餐化。
- 人物成长比较合理，主角确实是一步一步的变强的，即便学会一些很厉害的武功比如太极剑，也不能让你直接咸鱼翻身。

缺点不多，也不致命，稍微说一下：
- 前中期主角有点菜，需要努力练一下，有点耗时间，但是其实也契合了主线剧情。
- 武功各种混练也没所谓，这个感觉不符合正统武侠的设定，要走火入魔的意思，但是如果改动的话，需要重新平衡游戏的难度
- 最后一个可能过于主观（这里稍有剧透，没玩的就别看了），蓝衣女主（我就别说名字了）和主角的羁绊稍微有点强扯一起的感觉，如果能在润色一下将会更好。

总之强力推荐，也非常感谢游戏公司制作了这个有深度的好游戏，从仙剑4之后 好久没这种沉浸其中的感觉了。",1701000972,1701000972,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Suffice it to say I am glad I I stuck with it/dug a little deeper. No, enemy difficulty makes no sense--enemies that look terrifying are pushovers, enemies that look harmless can be deadly, and some quests you receive, early on, will send you to areas that will put you in an early grave.

That said, this game has an oddly satisfying grind. If you're just trying to churn out XP for buying out skills or cultivations, and you're fighting an enemy that you can easily overwhelm, you can automate combat (much like in Ogre Tactics). Yes, the AI is utterly moronic, but it's evenhandedly clueless--your and their units will rush headlong at one another and throw out the best moves they can, regardless of status effects or position. Most people might take umbrage with this, and it does make combat somewhat stale in many instances, but it does force you to fight the battles you should be fighting yourself manually. While your opponents may lack strategy, you must implement it, and do so wisely, in certain instances in order to be able to triumph.

This game emphasizes, over every other consideration, the collection and mastering of cultivations. Oddly, this compels you to favor exploration and interacting with characters moreso than grinding out xp. You'll still do the latter, but largely in lieu of the former. It also places considerable emphasis on dueling.

The story is surprisingly decent, especially in lieu of the fact that it's a translation. I truly enjoy the fact that certain characters take actions for reasons entirely unbeknownst to you, and that more often than not their motives, when finally disclosed, tend to explain their behavior quite well. There's no ""behind the scenes"" cut aways, at least yet, informing you the player of something your character isn't privy to, ala FF Tactics, and the like. Moreover, intelligent characters tend to behave intelligently. This is refreshing, as so often is the case, nowadays we're told someone is intelligent without ever witnessing the proof thereof. On at least one occasion a character even quotes/cites Sun Tzu while explaining the reasoning behind a particular strategy. Marvelous!

Honestly, I wish there was more RPG to Wandering Sword, and that character interactions weren't so shallow/limited, but what is there is solid.

If you want this to be an in-depth/comprehensive tactics title that allows for deeply considered combat, you'll be disappointed. Likewise if you want this to be an engrossing RPG, where every character has an impact on your experience of the story, you'll be disappointed. However, if you're looking for something in between that does an excellent job of engaging, you, the player in the character's growth and development, you'll be delighted. 

I've gone a bit nanners and before completing the elite disciple quest, have managed to gain the Supreme rank and defeat/spar rob all of the Supreme and above NPC's, save for one Shaolin fellow who I don't like the look of. lol I don't know how I'll ever get up the gumption for a second play through, but my oh my am I looking forward to unleashing my character on the unsuspecting baddies from the as yet inaccessible areas.

This is not a minus, it's a great style and while this may be one of the first rpgs after Octopath to use it, it surely won't be the last. But, well, it's not an Octopath clone.

This is a rather classic jrpg game, the main story is set, character customization is very limited, you can't even rename the main character. There are, however, many side quests to find and do, plus a variety of characters you can recruit to join you on your travels. Some of these recruits are harder to find and recruit than others, but it's possible, if you play carefully and pick the correct choices, to recruit all of them in the same game.

This is a wuxia-themed game, so rather than gaining xp and levels, progression relies heavily on learning new techniques and mastering them, improving your cultivation and using special pills (items) as well as improving your equipment. These things can be found all over, sometimes in chests, sometimes from quests, but also from having a high enough friendship with other characters who have/know them.

This leads to an important, but also weird, aspect of the game: Gifting, Sparring, and Consulting. Affinity is raised by a few quests, but mostly by gifts. To be able to gift a character, you need to be near their strength, or above them. Anything you give them goes into their personal inventory (which you can see at any time, once you're close enough to get their interaction menu). At 20 Affinity (a single item can get you there, depending on rarity), you can spar with them, a 1vs1. If you win a spar, they give you 1-3 items from their personal inventory...

Some characters can be Consulted with, starting at 40 Affinity, up to 90 Affinity (Affinity maxes at 100), to boost your experience with crafting skills, or to learn techniques from them. Be careful about learning hiqh quality techniques from Masters, the two highest qualities of techniques require you to win spars to learn. Characters who can be recruited take 60 Affinity to recruit.

Hm. I'm starting to lose track of what I wanted to say... 

The dev roadmap currently includes providing more options on the main story route, like potentially allowing you to join different/other sects, but as it's just a roadmap mention, we'll just have to wait and see.

The game is fun and interesting, though it will probably be hard to do everything in one playthrough given how hard it can be to find everything, and how certain events are only available during certain timeframes of the main quest.

The game came out this year, and the weakness of this is that this type of game really benefits from having extensive guides on various subjects. That takes time, and someone willing to do all the minutia of guide making. For example, this game would really benefit from having a guide on npc's initial inventories, gift preferences, locations, consult options, etc. available, but it's still too new for that to have happened yet.",1700858848,1700858848,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong its great for it's price as is but your looking at a B+ game that could achieve A+ or S- tier with a bit more love.  

The fundamental elements of the game are solid... Travel, Combat, how you ""level up"".  There's tons to explore and acquire as your main character grows throughout the game.   Where Wandering Sword suffers most is in the number of miss-able elements which coincide with a few cases where gated areas or events are suddenly available for all of a single scene before you miss out.  I ended up locked out of certain endings as a result of this.  It's unforgiving.  A New Game + feature is definitely needed (and on it's way).

Do you remember crossing the Sea of Mermaids with Feena in Grandia? The sense of adventure when flying Flammie for the first time in Secret of Mana, or when the Sprite finds that their entire village was destroyed? What about that time Robo got beaten up by his friends in Chronotrigger? When you find out about the other world in Tales of Symphonia? When you finally got to reunite with your family in DQV Hand of the Heavenly Bride? What about when your party broke out of the simulation in Star Ocean: Till the End of Time?

This game will not only bring back that sense of high adventure, interesting characters, and storytelling you remember from the good old days, but it presents it with the unique trapping of Chinese Wuxia fantasy. Its a beautiful classic tale, one of loss, love, family, camaraderie, betrayal, reversals, surprises, and destiny.  Some parts of which you may experience differently depending on your choices and encounters (allowing for replayability).

There were initially some issues with the game that have been largely taken care of by both bug fixes and QoL (quality of life) improvements since release. 

I played this game with both KB&M and Controller. While I usually prefer KB&M, I wanted to play this on my large TV with a controller to capture that old-school saturday morning feel and it worked great with my 8bitdo. KB&M is definitely a better experience, but its totally enjoyable with controller, just not as good, such as when you need to do lots of inventory management in succession. 

There were a couple bugs, such as the steps not being smooth in the Shaolin temple, and sometimes when you're trying to rest at an inn that charges money, it may bug out and not allow you to rest at any inn, and you either have to restart or rest in your home village or Luo Village (for free). (This bug usually started for me when I'd try to rest in Gusu outside of Mingjian Manor and would bug out the other Inns). The game also doesn't give you an audible notification when you use an item. Also, when you use/learn a food recipe from your inventory, it forgets to give you even a visual notification, so you sometimes feel like it didn't work (but it did), even though you do get text feedback when you use other items like Meridian pills. 

These are extremely minor issues in the grand scheme of things, but it would be nice for them to fix. 

There's a hundred good things I could talk about, but you only really need to know that this game was clearly crafted with love, and if you are a real OG RPG fan, then you should play this.

Edit: Just wanted to add that despite already feeling like a completed game, the devs have added a roadmap and are adding more content, features, and QoL features. While I don't agree with some (such as fast travel being added), the game overall is only getting better in terms of the gameplay experience.",1696799646,1700699469,True,26,0,0.75722503662109375,0,True,False,False

It is also quite good, even had some actually surprising reveals. Combat is satisfying. A bit simple, but unlocking new things keeps it alright until the end.

Unlocking the true ending is practically impossible without a guide and there are some side quests which you can miss. But these only really affect the ending text, so whatever. And exploring is easier with fast travel, so this may not be an issue anymore.   

The game has relatively little grinding, unless you want to level every usable character. And even then it is pretty quick. Though there are some extra martial arts and items you kinda have to repeatedly duel NPCs for, which can take a while. 

Finally, in its current state the game doesn't have much replay value. But the road map suggests this will change. The main issues are that the story doesn't branch and combat can effectively be solved by acquiring all the best martial arts - and these won't change from run to run in any significant way.

Once you get past not being able to pronounce most of the names, you do actually begin to gain some emotional investment in the characters. However, It is because the game does good enough to get you emotionally invested that it also runs into some of its drawbacks. I can't help but feel many of the character stories lack what I consider a satisfying conclusion. It is like the writers made the main story line, and everything else is just an after thought which can literally be skipped. 

The game requires you to raise other characters interest in you by giving them gifts or completing task if they have any. You can only give gifts to NPCS you can ""Observe"". The problem is, not all NPCs you can observe give quest, and there are a lot of them in the world. So, you have no idea which NPCs have optional side quest available in the world unless you raise their interest to max most of the time. This is very expensive and time consuming if you spar them to get stuff back. An example of no consequence; there is a monk in Shaolin on the far right of temple who sells stamina pills. He will ask you for a flute, you give him the flute, and that is that. Except, if you raise his interest level higher, he then will give 2 more quest that you didn't know he had. There is another little monk near this monk who gives a quest to get him candy. You get him the candy, quest done. You can then max out his interest in you and he has no more quest to give. This is a stupid system that makes you have to raise every NPCs interest almost as soon as you meet them because most quest in the game are also time sensitive and will disappear after certain points in the story. This means you have to retread the map multiple times before turning in main story quest to make sure new side quest didn't trigger somewhere. 

So, This game has more positives then negatives, but the negatives are absolutely there. If you are willing to pay attention to detail, and not have your hand held by the developer, then you can get a very expansive experience. You can run right through the game story, or you can slow down and pay attention to when something seems off. Such as the Beggar Sect main Quest, you can go immediately into the main battle, OR, slow down, notice something is odd, and investigate. You can be rewarded in this game for not being impatient. Just keep in mind the always doing the ""right thing"" in some quest doesn't always end in the best outcome. You can't think about this story as a modern day American, you need to understand at least a little of Chinese culture to catch all the details. SAVE OFTEN, with lots of backups in case you need to go back 2 hours rather then starting over. Even I was getting tired of the drag after a while and wish the dev had just given an indicator above the npcs as to who had quest. 

The fighting is also not very engaging as you become very over powered very quickly. In my last run I was beating many of the Sect heads before the sword tournament quest. Not hard to do once you understand how to maximize the power system and get special moves. There is a reason the Developers put in an auto battle system. You simply don't want to take time to focus on squashing everyone. 

You should basically view this game as a visual novel with many, many options. The story is the main focus of the game. Not the combat. Like I said, It is not hard to build a character to be almost unbeatable by the mid story if you wanted to. What hooks you is the desire to find out what happens next.",1696401037,1700634378,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False
1876890,150521359,76561198069459234,0,9,5462,0,5462,1697660157,"Absolutely loved it from start to finish, if you grew up watching movies like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers like me you'll feel right at home with this game. The aesthetics, art-style, hand-drawn portraits, pixel art graphics and soundtrack are all absolutely gorgeous, and the story is a classic hero journey from underdog to master, full of tales of honor, justice, revenge and sacrifice. The game is strongly story-based as it follows the tale of the young warrior Yuwen Yi as he gets involved into the world of martial arts. The story is simple, with a few twists along the way, but it is very effective and I enjoyed it a lot. It is fairly linear but it provides a lot of side-quests and characters providing different rewards like equipment, items or even recruitable allies.
It is a turn-based RPG with some tactical elements, the player has a party of up to five characters in battle (plus some additional characters in key story-related events) and both player and enemy characters take turn in battle according to their speed statistic (called Qi in-game). Characters specialize in different classes of weapons consisting of swords, sabers, spears/staves, fists or hidden weapons (which are basically projectiles) but the main character is able to use all of them. Characters gain Martial Points during battle, or by using manuals found throughout the game, which can be used to learn or improve techniques for each weapon type. Such techniques have different attack range, damage, and additional buffs/debuffs in a system that is easy to use but deep enough to optimize for hardcore RPG fans. Healing items, permanent upgrades and temporary buffs can be used outside of battle, and special techniques for recovering health or mana (used to perform different moves) or for getting buffs can be performed during battle. Each technique upgrade in turn confers Meridian Points which can be used to improve stats for each character in six different skill trees. 
The menues can be overwhelming at first but are fairly intuitive, as also is the inventory system which is reminiscent of action RPGs like Diablo or the like. That being said the amount of different items is immense so it can be difficult to keep track of all their names, their functions, and their locations. The number of cities, places to visit and characters is also quite large and similarly difficult to keep track so taking notes during the adventure is recommended. The game world is structured into different areas which are unlocked as the story progresses, so a careful balance between main quests and side quests is recommended to have a fulfilling experience.
Recruitment system is also somewhat peculiar as the main characters needs to gain affinity with other characters by making them gifts according to their preferences, completing some quests, and even answering some questions in simple dialogue trees. Once enough affinity is obtained the player can challenge the given NPC to a duel which can give rewards if won. Not all NPCs can be recruited, there are about 12 or 14 recruitable characters, and some of them have fairly complex recruiting conditions in specifics points of the story. There is definitely some replay value in trying to recruit all characters and investing in them during the adventure.
Many places are accessible to the player at every moment, with varying degrees of difficulty so balance can be an issue: I found the game to be quite hard at the beginning of the game when you have one or two characters and weak equipment, but once you get your fourth or fifth character the game becomes much easier, and by the end of the game there is practically no challenge. I don't think grinding is required at any point but there is some incentive for farming as the game provides different crafting systems like cooking, smithing, tailoring or even alchemy. There are few dungeons per-se as most areas are free to enter and leave all the time, with many of them requiring multiple visits at different points according to either main or side quests (which could also interfere with each other so be careful and save often). There are several endings depending of the affinity reached with key story-related characters so definitely there is replay value there too. There are some minor bugs and translation errors but none harms the experience.
Overall it is a fantastic experience for fans of both the wuxia genre and the RPG genre, and it is also accessible enough for newcomers to both genres provided the player has the patience to learn about the different systems and the game's lore.
EDIT: I had to edit this review in order to nominate the game for the Steam Awards, it really deserves it!

This game combat is fun, not too complicated, but enough depth where you can synergy and make builds. You also feel like you earn every inch of power, as this game forgoes traditional levelling in favor of a meridian stat point system. You get enough meridian points, you can dump them into one of six paths that give you major stat buffs. You get this points by acquiring cultivation methods and investing into them. The more you acquire, the more powerful you get. Same with gear, you have to make stuff to forge better gear, and actually gather the resources, specially the rare ones. Their is no automatic levelling system, so your power is based on how much you wanna grind. The story is sorta railroaded, especially if you get all the powers early in the game and can beat the sect masters in duels -_-.

Its simply comes down to, the game is just too easy after mid-game. If you are like me and don't like your character to be weak then you go grind, find ways to get stronger and tackle them. That is the problem though. You take down the heads of the major sects for the cultivation books and what a fight they are. You are on deaths door optimising to take them down and truly this is the best part of the game. But then ""Boom"". You return to the story and you expect that you will stroll through a good bit now you had your fun and got pretty strong. But you actually stroll through everything for hours and I mean hours of going around and auto battling quests without even taking a point of damage on your main guy.

For this game to truly deliver on the ""masterpiece"" aspect it needs better scaling or a ""hard mode"" for people who like to have those big boss challenges at every stage. I love how easy it is to get the books but maybe only have a limited number of them in use is a better option to so I don't scale so hard. This way players would have to choose what books to use instead of using everything.

The story is pretty fun
the game has high replayability because the choices that you make matter to the story
lots of recruitable members
side stories are fun
I suggest you play this with the real-time battle instead of the turn-based system, it will save you a LOT of time, and its more fun tbh
I don't know how many endings are there but I think I got the good/normal ones

sadly there's no NewGame+ having to learn and farm everything again is a hassle if I want to play and see the different endings
I'd give it 8/10 it's a pretty fun Wuxia game

A lot of the side quests are fun sleuthing stuff, and while some falls into the ""Guide Dang It"" pitfall with some esoteric conditions, most of them you can clear entirely through in-game clues, including some subtle ones communicated only through character dialogue. I do have to add a complaint for a lack of dialogue history though. Would be helpful to be able to read back on these.

The biggest negative I can say is that it can get very grindy, although the updates has added options to make battles go entirely automatically, be real-time instead of turn-based, and run at 2x speed, all of which reduces the slog. There's currently also no New Game+ option, so you have to repeat the grind again if you want to replay the game.

As a final note, the game seems to still be updating at a relatively rapid pace, and not all updates are reflected on a previously saved game, so if you bought this but haven't started a new game yet, I recommend maybe waiting a month or so before playing just to see whether there's any new updates. Personally, I'm very satisfied with the game as of the September 30th hotfix, but that's after some crucial updates compared to release (such as the auto battle and battle speed options), and there are things I would like to see implemented such as New Game+ and Dialogue History.

ADDENDUM: After some more thinking, I believe the phrase ""finished but not complete"" best describes this game on release. This doesn't change my rating (the core gameplay and story remains solid as-is), but if you choose to play it now, it may feel like there are certain things that are missing that should be obvious.

Ultimately, in addition to my above review, I believe this game would've benefited from a short period of Early Access to collect comments and suggestions to help polish it before going gold.",1696300110,1700453312,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

优点：
1.大地图非常开放，场景设计量也很足，虽然几个边疆区域走剧情主线才能解锁，但是已经足够你逛了，可以非常自由地各处搜刮，找人切磋学武功和拿好东西
2.武学搭配自由度非常高，可挑选队友也很多（当然是主角搭配4个妹子队友啦）。本人主角学的剑系，但是感觉不是特别强，单挑最强的应该是拳系武学，不过随便主修哪个派系通关都是无压力的
3.打怪升级非常轻松，小怪开即时战斗挂机2倍速几秒就结束了，懒人福音。找高手切磋的时候可以开回合制手动，体验一步一步战胜更强对手的乐趣
4.几个大的支线任务一定要做，不做的话游戏体验和时长少一半。大支线的剧情量设计还是非常充足的

缺点：
1.后期游戏数值崩了，成型之后所有战斗都是挂机过，包括BOSS战，没有战斗体验。BOSS单挑战给个面子手动回合制操作一下，也没什么难度
2.剧情后面进展太快了，不知道是制作经费不足呢还是换编剧了，如果能和那几个大支线一样仔细打磨下就好了
3.感觉和女主的感情戏没什么铺垫，人物性格不鲜明，塑造还不如反派角色

this is my review after i completed the game (edited).
i  REALLY HOPE there is DLC after the ending where we can exploit more of jianghu, let say with heavenly demon cult rebirth or something route so once again yuwen yi is being asked to help beat the demon lord (well thats usually the common plot). add new map and harder mobs and bosses, this game is spectacular for its targeted niche especially for me. there arent many games that explore murim/wuxia world and you guys have done it beautifully, its a bit regretful that you guys have not explored this ""world"" a bit deeper.

some input for me:
1. make better design for the MC weapon in battle (even some mobs weapon looks better than what our MC hold)
2. add 1,5x speed. to a bit fast to see the skill animation and 1x speed way too slow to enjoy it.
3. if you would bother to implement more branches where we get to pick our sect depending on our weapon of choice and see more dialogue (since there are 3 sect that hold the *** cultivation method so i think the story will end up same without changing much)
4. set the limit where we CAN NOT get TOO OVERPOWERED in early to mid game, with the spar system player can exploit ""cheat loop"" to get powerful cultivation method and one/two shotted enemy in main story line.
5. set some cosmetic to exploit (this can be fun yet challenging quest for players to explore, of course it will be more work for the design team but hey its okay! CHARGE US LOL as long its affordable or even a bit pricey I BELIEVE people will buy them.

Simple enough, would have liked it if npcs tried to use lightness and cultivation skills during combat, but I understand what a pain in the ass that would be to code in. Maybe clashing like in the cutscenes could've been a combat thing.

Best innovation from the gameplay is probably the real time option, most turn based games have the issue where level 1 grunts fighting your level 100 squad takes an unreasonable amount of time to kill but the real time option with auto makes it feel like your team is actually just on a different level to the riff-raff,. 8.5/10, 

Pixel art 9/10, very solid not much to say

music 8/10, could've had a few more tracks because the same 10-15 started to get a little repetitive after 40 or so hours

characters decent 8/10, there were some characters with nuance like the shifu and the red lady from the xuanhuo cult, but most were pretty cliché. I would have liked to see more character interactions in party, maybe a random event when you rest or something that could facilitate this.

Overall 8.5/10 very nice Wuxia game, I enjoyed gifting a blue item than ""sparring"" (essentially just robbing) a little too much.",1699946485,1699946485,True,3,1,0.525057792663574219,0,True,False,False

unique jrpg system without levels

volumes of story.

negatives:
GM npcing.. from not letting you play your own character, to having the npc you play saved by any random joe or karen in the game... you name it  its there. For the 50 first hours of gameplay the idiot i am forced to play is saved time and time again by the cool people. it even breaks immersion to do so. at points u even feel that npcs are stalking you to last hit  ur enemies i mean wth...
interupting combat with cinematics where YOU LOOSE (even when u kick their butt) cause the villain has plot armour..
Railroaded... it could had been a great open world rpg where u choose ur f... sect and level up or even do different things ... no no no u HAVE to do THAT sect learn THAT skill, marry THAT girl, the heck make the shit a visual novel and be done with it? This also reduces the replayability of the game... y bother eg restart and make the first fisherman (thats what yuwen yi means) a proper boxer or saberman, if he is going to join the sword sect anyway... and since i will learn the sword skills anyway why bother learning the other skills too? there is no point to restart the game and try it all over with a different build i just load the last save and go beat up the masters till i learn their skills... BORING.
Choices don't matter. so why have them? there are even times where you are given 2 choices and if it does not like your choice it proceeds to force you to the other choice.
last boss was not allowed to get ur group in the fight... not even ur companions... i bothered to level and raise a group 4 what reason? never mind that they were lagging behind in exp but w/e. (nvm that if u invest the limited resources of the game to ur companions, which is something that is reasonable since they are ALL npcs including the guy you play, u will be too weak to fight the last boss)
in all  i could had played this game a lot because i liked its mechanics. But its story telling was so damn bad i ll unistall it after this playthrough that i totally forced myself to see through.",1699873947,1699873947,False,1,0,0.4797687828540802,0,True,False,False

The story is fun, albeit a little generic. The cast is enjoyable, although the optional characters do not have much participation besides their side stories.

My only two true complaints:

1 - Weapon balancing. Sword MC is just plainly better than all the alternatives. The skills are superior and more accessible. If this were Pokemon, Swords would be Bulbasaur, the only gym leaders in the game would be Brock, Misty, Surge (hidden weapons, the only ones that might give you some trouble), and Eirika (swords lol). Also, 80% of the available TMs are grass type.

2 - Romance option. The game kind of shoves the heroine down your throat. Five seconds after the MC meets her, he is already blushing, stuttering, gasping, and simping, which was really cringe to watch...

Also, the game has a Ned Stark. A few Ned Starks really. Get ready because he/she is one of the coolest characters that will get yeeted in the first hour of the game but whose death serves as a narrative motivation. Be warned.",1699852068,1699853257,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What makes this game unique:
I'd never played a game in the Wuxia genre before (though I had heard of Wuxia before) so the art style, factions, and grid-based combat system was really different and fresh. You really feel like a martial artist which is fun. The devs made a great choice in making the strongest part of the game (the combat system) integral to so many things like sparring NPC's to gain their items/epic martial arts skills and progressing so many of the quest lines.

The Good:
-Art, music, and general ambiance
-The Story (until the endgame)
-Combat system
-RPG aspects
-Companions are quite unique and there are a lot of them

My first impressions of the game are overwhelmingly positive. I was immediately captivated by its setting and theme. The moment I learned that there was a Wuxia RPG available, I leapt at the opportunity to play it. Having grown up watching Jackie Chan's ""Drunken Master"" films, Jet Li's portrayal of ""Fong Sai-yuk"", and the iconic ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" I've always yearned for an RPG set in a martial arts-infused version of China. The closest experience I had was ""Jade Empire"" by BioWare, but in my opinion, this game surpasses it by focusing more on human elements rather than an abundance of magic and fantasy. Yes, I understand that Qi and martial arts are woven into the fabric of the game's magic system, but ""Jade Empire"" felt overly fantastical for my tastes.

Moreover, this game features 2D-HD graphics that remind me of classics like ""Xenogears"" and ""Suikoden 1 and 2,"" which are some of my all-time favorite PS1 games. Discovering this gem filled me with joy. However, like many others, I tried to temper my excitement to avoid being overly hyped. I approached the game with the mindset that, while it had a promising concept, it would likely have flaws—which is acceptable. To my delightful surprise, I was happily mistaken.


I'm enjoying the story thus far, though I haven't finished the game yet, and I'm hopeful that it will continue to improve. I'll concede that the early part was somewhat challenging to grasp, largely because I presume that introducing the myriad sects, characters, martial arts, plots, intrigues, wars, conflicts, and even philosophies within the first few hours is no small feat. However, in my view, this adds an incredible depth and maturity to the narrative, rather than presenting a simplistic dichotomy of good versus evil. It feels as if I'm immersed in a ""Game of Thrones""-esque tale filled with moral ambiguities, which, once again, brings to mind the complexities I admired in ""Suikoden 2"" and ""Xenogears.""

Another aspect of the game I find particularly engaging is the abundance of side stories and events one encounters simply by exploring. For instance, while on a mission to dispatch some wolves in the mountains, I stumbled upon a cutscene completely unrelated to my side quest. I encountered a fascinating individual threatened by bandits—I won't spoil anything, but it was a delightful surprise. These spontaneous events, triggered by exploration, contribute to the sense of living in a dynamic world. It feels as though you're not always the main character but rather a witness to unfolding events that eventually have an impact on you. I find this incredibly immersive.

Additionally, I appreciate the optional companions you can discover in the game. So far, I've only recruited five, and, regrettably, one has perished—no spoilers, I'll delve into that later. However, what I believe this game does better than ""Suikoden"" is how it attaches extensive side quests to these characters that are logical, compelling, and distinct from the main storyline. This design choice fosters a genuine interest in pursuing their individual arcs and learning more about their backgrounds.

Furthermore, ""Suikoden"" features 108 characters, which can feel overwhelming and often leaves little room for well-developed backstories, in my opinion. This game manages to strike a better balance, allowing for more in-depth narratives for its characters.

**Small SPOILER WARNING**

I was utterly astounded by a certain element related to the side companions I encountered in my gameplay. There's a companion you can recruit who follows the typical RPG recruitment process: engage in dialogue, complete a side quest, perform a task, build a rapport, embark on another quest, and finally, they join your party, etc. However, this game throws a wrench into the formula. Even if you do everything by the book—being kind, trusting, and defending this character—they ultimately betray you, leading to a confrontation where you're forced to eliminate them.

Immediately after this event, I took to the internet to see if it was possible to avoid this betrayal, which it turns out you can, though the solution isn't entirely obvious. Despite this, I chose not to revert to a previous save to change the outcome because the way that storyline concluded seemed organic and just. What I appreciate the most is that this event doesn't seem to heavily affect the game's ending, or at least I hope it doesn't. This twist was awesome!

Combat-wise, the gameplay doesn't break new ground, but I do appreciate the familiar formula and the versatility it offers in choosing which weapon to specialize in. It adds a unique element that the main character is the only one with the option to select from different weapons, which streamlines the experience. Allowing every character to choose would have been cumbersome—take ""Final Fantasy XII"" as an example, where every character can essentially become indistinguishable from the others, to its detriment. It's refreshing to see characters defined by their individual weapon styles, and it's a nice touch that the main character is recognized as uniquely versatile, being the only one capable of mastering different styles. And just for your information, fists reign supreme!

Visually, the game is stunning and evokes a strong sense of nostalgia, reminiscent of the PS1 era. It conjures memories of classics like ""Suikoden 1 and 2,"" ""Xenogears,"" the ""Mana"" series, ""Chrono Trigger,"" and many other 2D RPGs of that time, while also bringing to mind newer titles such as ""Stardew Valley."" The art style is particularly effective and, in my opinion, suits the game even better than ""Octopath Traveler."" Speaking of ""Octopath Traveler,"" my one major gripe with it is the disproportionate enemy sizes during combat—they're inexplicably ten times larger than the player characters, which I find ridiculous!

Now, I'm going to delve into a bit of nitpicking regarding character progression and stats. I understand the developers' desire to innovate beyond the traditional leveling up mechanism commonly seen in RPGs while still rewarding those who grind or engage beyond the main story's linear path with a sense of increased power. Personally, I relish the grind and the sense of overpowering certain enemies because I've chosen to strengthen my characters through diligent grinding and exploration. As long as there's a reasonable progression for players who wish to delve into as much content as possible before advancing the main storyline, I'm all for it.

The game chooses to enhance your character through the concepts of Cultivation learning and Meridian points gained from these studies. There's also the element of acquiring different styles and power with martial points, which affects your stats. In my opinion, the game doesn't clearly explain this system early on. I found myself turning to Google to figure out how to 'level up' my character and decide what to focus on to prevent them from becoming ineffective. However, I do like the notion of the main character roaming around, learning like a ravenous martial artist who never ceases to master new styles.

I would suggest that the developers take a cue from an RPG called ""Chained Echoes,"" which also cleverly sidesteps the leveling trope. It opts for strengthening characters through specific books found throughout the game, available either through progression or as rewards for completing side content.",1699723058,1699723225,True,22,0,0.713447034358978271,0,True,False,False

Game is essentially wuxia Octopath Traveler from the look to gift system but with grid-based/tactics combat. Instead of levels you use martial points from fighting to improve cultivation skills and open meridians for stats. Gameplay was fun for a while but got boring as it's not very deep and some fights with multiple enemies just take forever. Fortunately there's an auto battle option and you can switch between real time and turn-based combat to speed things up. In my playthrough I did everything before leaving the first area, I was strong enough to fight the sect leaders - which you can still get stronger from better late game gear but your stats are enough to finish the story easily. Unfortunately after beating the sect leaders there were no more challenging fights until the final boss fight.

I have a number of complaints, mostly minor. Considering the price of the game and lack of English wuxia themed games, if you're interested I think you'll overlook the problems and have a good time as well. Although I wouldn't recommend trying to do everything before leaving the first area - though some side quests are gated by main story progress so be careful if you plan on going back for stuff.

Looking forward to the NG+ update, difficulty option and DLC. Biggest complaint is lack of endgame difficulty content and I'm hoping the future DLC solves that",1699498317,1699498317,True,0,0,0.474683523178100586,0,True,False,False

The Swordman Studio has crafted an expansive world with an interesting depiction of heroes and martial arts, paired with beautiful music and pixel graphics. Similarly, a refreshing take on levelling through Cultivations and the Meridian system grew on me throughout the game. 

[h2] The Story [/h2]

In essence, you follow the protagonist on a journey through intrigue as he seeks revenge for events that happen early on in the story only to get ravelled up in a plot which forces him to become stronger to save those he cares about.  

He's the cliche ""good guy"", but here, it works. Media often struggles to create characters like this as they can be seen as bland. Yet, we see his views and opinions form from those he meets, his connections, and the situations he finds himself in. His personality is shaped by virtues, not just ""I'm good because I'm good"". 

Generally speaking, the story had some pacing issues. The opening can feel relatively slow, while there are times further in the game when over five minutes' worth of text boxes are thrown at you back to back. If you're not proficient in reading the names of different cultures, you can quickly become lost about who is who and lose focus. 

Still, the story is great. It's full of cliches and obvious plot twists, BUT I think for a game like this in a world like this, it adds to the charm rather than detracts. 

However, that can't be said about the ending. If you're someone who needs everything to be wrapped up nice and neat, then you might be disappointed. The conclusion is rather abrupt, with so many questions left unanswered about characters and the world as a whole. Most notable, though, is the handling of companions, which I'll cover in that section below. 

[h2] Gameplay & Leveling [/h2]

The gameplay felt like a mix of Live a Live with a sprinkling of your everyday JRPG. Your characters fight on a tile set with moves you can learn via manuals. While the main character can use any weapon, companions are limited to their chosen weapon once you bring them into your team. 

As such, you have great flexibility with your main character in what they use and learn. Although, it is still recommended to stick to one weapon due to how you progress and ""level"". 

In typical RPGs, you're level-gated. Gain EXP until you level and get stronger. That isn't the case here, and instead, you're looking to gain two levelling currencies, ""Martial Points"" and ""Meridian Points"". 

Martial points are ""grindable""; they're what you get after winning battles. 

You use these to level your moves and make them stronger. You also use them to level your Cultivation Methods. These moves are typically more defensive (although not limited to), providing you with your Meridian points and an increase to HP/MP. 

You then spend those Meridian Points on multiple skill boards to gain core stats and passive bonuses. It sounds complicated, and admittedly, I was like, ""Erm... what?"" when I first saw it, but it's pretty intuitive and provides a good deal of flexibility when choosing how to level your character. Like most games, there's an optimal way to spend them (cough, Max conception, cough), but the choice is there. 

This means, however, that your growth is tied to your owned cultivation methods, meaning grinding doesn't do much besides gain you money and bankable martial points after a particular stage. 

You can also choose to fight in real-time or turn-based. It's recommended to only play in real-time when you're sure you're stronger than your opponent, which is true. There's also an ""auto-battle"" option which you should use when playing real-time. Playing real-time manually is like trying to keep up with friends who have downed 50 energy drinks; you just can't. Turn-based also allows more intentional strategy, which I took advantage of to win fights I would've been decimated on with real-time. 

[h2] Companions [/h2]

There are a fair amount of companions you can recruit, with some having detailed story lines, others having barely any, and one being so elusive in terms of requirements that you have no hope if you aren't playing with a guide. 

For the most part, you meet them and help them with a sub-quest, they join, you raise their affection again to a specific number, and they take you on a companion quest. Usually resulting in learning a powerful move and liking you more. 

Aside from these quests, only a few have involvement in future sub/story quests, at which point it's only to remark on their thoughts on the situation. 

The story doesn't account for them, so 90% of the game 'feels' like you're solo despite having a team. And more egregiously, there is no resolution for them. No end-of-game credit scenes, no slideshow like Fallout; it just ends. 

Also, most of them are missable if you don't find them before specific story points, so that's fun...

[h2] Consulting & Sparring [/h2]

My favourite mechanics. You can spar with any sparrable (is that a word?) NPC, as indicated by an icon next to their name. Sparring forces you into a 1v1 duel, and if you win, you gain some points and some of their inventory. 

You can use this to 'steal' stronger items from them, manuals for moves (which include cultivation methods) and more. Similarly, consult allows you to learn a move that person knows, adding it to your arsenal. 

The idea here is that you must interact with new people, challenge stronger foes and explore to get stronger. This forces you to think strategically about who you can or can't beat or try and brute force it to get something you want to gain strength. 

It's also a large part of why I neglected the story for about 10 hours, beat everyone and got so overpowered by mid-game that I could auto the rest of the game with no problem... Oh, the life of a completionist. Just note if you do what I did, the game can get seriously repetitive, as you'll have no need to manually fight anything again. 

Great mechanics that help keep you engaged, though. 

[h2] The Rest [/h2]

You'll have noticed that I haven't spoken about the negatives yet, aside from the story ending and the companion's use, and that's deliberate. 

There are quite a few things that I personally disliked - 

[list]
[*] The redundancy of the alchemy system
[*] The redundancy of the stamina system 
[*] Some translation/grammatical errors
[*] Controller UI (please play on keyboard)
[*] No clear way to know where sub-quests are
[/list]

Some reviews have also noted other elements, but the reason I've omitted them is because some of these you can outright ignore. Similarly, a few of them are down to personal taste and how you enjoy your games. If you're not overly critical or let one spelling mistake ruin your time with a game, then you'll enjoy yourself. 

The dev team seem passionate about user feedback and has already implemented a fair few QOL updates that have made the game significantly better. I have no doubt some of what people dislike will be addressed in the coming months. 

If you're still hesitant and unsure, I would read a few negative reviews, as they focus on the specific mechanics that particular player didn't enjoy. 

[h2] Final Thoughts [/h2]

Given the genre, world and topics, I believe this is a love-or-hate-it type of game. I found myself fond of the story and the characters and could retain that immersion despite the more minor things bugging me. 

It is not perfect, nor a 10/10, but it's an enjoyable and worth playing 30 - 50 hour experience. I'm excited to see what the team create next, as no doubt they'll build upon this already solid framework.",1699295127,1699295127,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- How you you even end your turn facing the desired direction and not position yourself for a rear attack?
- Upon opening the character menu, it takes too many clicks to get to the inventory section to use items
- Inconsistent item description pop-up, it disappears after an action and you have to keep toggling the pop-up with R3
- Trigger dialogue with A button but continuing dialogue with B......
- On Meridian Point advancement page, selecting the points is honestly super tedious as you would expect to navigate around the skills but you often end up hovering over the characters or the stats on the right side.

4. 主线极容易卡关，而且没有比较明显的等级提示，卡完主线卡支线……因为数值卡关没什么意思；卡关后也没有发现什么提升人物的方式，对人物如何变强没有很好的引导，游戏节奏不丝滑
5. 队友系统，多一个队友固然对队伍有增强，但是（起码在前期）能招募到的队友都是纯路人NPC，缺少富含魅力的队友角色，没有招募和练人的动力
6. 遇到人数较多的战斗时，敌我混杂，看不清局势
虽然我对这游戏的缺点很不满意，但是我反对说它抄袭八方的说法，除了像素回合制，两个游戏几乎没什么共同点

Music: Adequate (and the endgame battle music is great)
Moment to Moment gameplay: Engaging
Text: Somewhat stilted translation but if you're into cultivation stories to begin with you're used to that :D

Story: Playing as a clearly defined character does the game a lot of good. The protagonist has firmly defined wants and desires and we're along for his tale of adventure, rather than trying to have some customisable protagonist in a genre where half the players would make a deranged slaving psychopath if they could get away with it. 

Wandering Sword hews to the archetypes of the genre in presentation and art - a bald guy with a mustache is always and inevitably going to be evil, for example - but its overall story is an enjoyable ride elevated by a protagonist that has firm principles and a commitment to justice as doing the right thing rather than justice as slavishly following the law. 

Gameplay: the game difficulty varies wildly depending on how much effort you put into acquiring various martial arts techniques and battle experience to max them all out. If you get every technique in the game, max out everything and put together a synergistic moveset with the options presented to you, you are essentially a one-man-army that can effortlessly solo everything, which feels pretty good in a cultivation game. However, you have to actually *work* for it instead of it all falling into your lap for free so it's still an enjoyable *game* until you get to that point, too.


I particularly want to praise the Real Time Auto Battle function where you can basically let all your companions and the player character fight trash tier enemies for skillpoints and loot, which is a blessing because so many turn-based games expect you to grind and grind but don't have a way to automate it normally.

Overall, strong recommendation if you're a fan of the genre and a solid recommendation if you're not.",1699090905,1699090905,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-2D turn based Wuxia game focused on cultivation and lots of Wugong styles.
-The Zero to Hero progression.
-Compelling story.
-Awesome music.

The Bad:
-Underwhelming skills effects look too generic and boring, no ""Wow"" effects whatsoever.
-The virtual feedback of landing hits is nonexistent, takes away the excitement of battles.
-The materials for endgame gears & healing items are extremely rare you'd have to spend days grinding.
-Game ends abruptly leaving you wonder what about all these characters you recruited?
-Linear story with only 1 single sect to join, no actual freedom.
-Lacks character depths, don't really feel engaged with each one.

Conclusion:
Still a fun game with some replayability. You'd have to replay a few times to know how to recruit all the characters and gather all the Wugong and Cultivation techniques and plan out a good endgame build.

-world looks great

Amazingly enough, there are really only maybe 10 total that are worth playing.  Most RPG's are hack and slash games or otherwise not really RPG's.  So it's nice when a game like this comes out.

A few bugs and improvements I would really appreciate:

1. D-pad support.  The D-pad works for most things, but does not control the characters while they walk around in towns or on the map.  Why?  I absolutely can't stand using the joystick on my controller.  Please add support for the d-pad to control character movement.
2. Better controller support.  Sort function.  There are a MILLION items.  But there is no way to sort them using the controller.  I guess there is a sort function that might work using a keyboard or mouse.  But why can't I sort the items with my game controller?  Please fix this.

2. Please add an optimize equipment feature.  There are MILLIONS of Items in this game.  I could easily spend 1/2 my time, going through all the swords, shoes, armor, and helmets trying to find the best one to equip on each of the 8 or 9 characters in my team.  WHY?  There should be a button that equips the optimum equipment for each character based on whatever item has the highest stats.  Just like most every other RPG ever made.  Why did this typical feature get skipped in this game?

3. Stamina...  I spend way too much time trying to refill my stamina.  I have also found that there is a glitch with the Inn in Gusu City.  Often, when I try to rest there to heal my team, the game will not process the action.  The controls refuse to allow me to rest at the Gusu Inn.  It also happens in other towns, but usually it's Gusu.  Finally, when my team has full stats except stamina is not full, often I can't rest at an Inn.  It just won't work.  Why?  Who knows.  But this means I have to walk all the way to Wudang and sleep in my bed to get my stamina filled up.  Annoying!

These above 4 items cause me a lot of annoyance.  The game's overall quality of play and enjoyment would be greatly increased if they were addressed.  And they seem to be easy enough to address.

Keep in mind, I played this using a Vietnamese language patch so some names can be differed from the English or Chinese version.

Having read Jin Yong's novels and see some adaptations back when I was a wee lad, I can say that this is a love letter to the novels and the wuxia genre as a whole. From the depiction of the martial arts techniques, the characters, the factions, the story tropes and motifs, it's pretty much takes heavy inspiration from mister Jin's works (ie. Yuwen Yi is a composite of Guo Jing (Condor Heroes) and Zhang Wuji (Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber); Yan Weihuan is the alternative Xiao Feng from Gods and Demons; Jiang Yinfeng and Yu Yun (""orthodox"" and ""evil"" couple) are what Linghu Chong and Ren Yingying could be after the events of The Smiling, Proud Wanderer); story sets in essentially the fall of a Sino-centric dynasty (Ning - Southern Song) to nomadic empires (Yuan - Jurchens, Mongols)). (on a sidenote: Both Feng and Yun names also made up the pivotal plot point Wind and Cloud Technique and the game's title in Chinese).

Gameplay is solid, although it still falls into the same pitfall as many classic RPGs do, when you have to grind for exp (or in this case martial points) to further progressing the game in the latter stages. I do enjoy the grid-based combat to many extent, though.

Graphics are just MWAH. For a pixel-based title, everything seems like it's from a painting with each of its zones, cities, valleys, etc. Occasionally, I just go into a zone like Cherry Blossom Forest and standing there, admiring.

So, if you are a fan of the wuxia genre, give this game a try. In the future, I wonder if there's more story dlcs to be added, aside from the current Wudang Sect storyline (a Shaolin or maybe an ""evil"" or ""unorthodox"" sects or schools storyline perhaps? Or even a true wandering swordsman story, where you aren't aglined with any factions).

I have now completed the game in around 74 hours and I will say it was a great journey. There wasn't a point where I felt I had to grind. If there was any grinding it was because I wanted to do it. It wasn't a waste of time either. Everything you do or led to do in the game rewards your time with an outcome that is satisfying. The cast of characters is memorable and you really feel like you are in an expansive world.


###Updated Review###
When I first started this game I enjoyed it after only playing it for less than 2 hours. However I am now over 30 hours into the game and I will say I can't put this down. The progression systems of the characters feels very rewarding. If you take the time to explore and do the side quests you are rewarded with getting stronger which feels really good. 

The Dev's have been very proactive to feedback and pushed out many QoL changes requested by the community within the first week of release. The best and most helpful update has been the addition of the ability to toggle auto battle from within the battle. When the game first launched you had the ability to set your battles to auto when you were outside of combat. This was great for grinding materials or currency. However if you encountered a strong foe on accident you were not able to change back to manual battle within the actual battle itself. This usually meant you lost and would have to restart from autosave and remember that you needed to toggle it before you got to that point. Also the auto battle would only control your team members and your main character would just stand there till the battle was over. 

With the new QoL addition you can easily switch between auto and manual in any battle which helps when needing to take command of the action. Also now during auto the main character automatically moves and attacks as well which helps with auto grinding mats for alchemy. 

Overall only seeing nice things and the story is very engaging. I started off doing side quests because the rewards were very good and before I knew it I had spent over 18 hours doing them before I wanted to continue on with the main story. 

###Original Review###
This game is great. If you are a fan of Wuxia novel or Manhua comics then this is everything that you enjoy about those stories in the form of a Chinese RPG (chRPG???).

3. Crafting and Gathering

The thing that struck me most is the game's narrative and gameplay approach, which stands apart from other jrpg-style works. The plot - beyond a few small moments in which a bit of suspension of disbelief is necessary - follows that of a wuxia story of classical Chinese culture, with its original elements but without upsetting the genre. And this is good because until now there were NO jrpgs about wuxia stories.
The gameplay and the method of recruiting people is interesting, and depending on the mission, relationships are created that make the player become fond of the various characters (so much so that it is a shame at a certain point to have to forcibly leave them behind when they become too weak) .
The story is - as I was saying - a classic Chinese intrigue of sects and cults that fight and coexist with each other, and whose balance is destabilized by something hidden in the sins committed in the past (without saying anything else). However it works well and it is interesting to look at it from this point of view. The characters are well written and characterized. Despite a few coughs, the plot also proceeds well and - like all similar stories - is intrigued by a series of characters who all seem to have a role within something that is older and bigger than us.
The gameplay is very interesting and requires brains and the game is (thank god) HARD. Sometimes even a little too unfair if I have to be honest. If I understand correctly, the programmers claim that it is possible to win almost any battle (even those that you would have to lose in the plot), but I see it difficult for this to correspond to reality (beyond a terrifying Grind in every phase of the game) .

If I have one small criticism of the writing, perhaps it's that too many things within the game are out of our control and for much of the game it always feels like we find ourselves fighting with people who only let us live because we are extremely less strong (at least in the first part).

The game is long (60 hours to beat and make a lot of sidequest), had A LOT of endings and it comes with good musics and pixelart. 

Overall a small masterpiece, especially if we consider that this is the first game from this developer. Highly recommended.",1698574989,1698574989,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

About the world settings and history:

1 - The power progression is too fast and too easy, at mid game i was already unrivaled and could beat any sect master as a elite disciple
2 - There is not a single mythical beast (dragon, phoenix) or mythical weapon, i could say the same about cultivation methods but you can argue that the story is based on this so i can let that pass
3 - The world lacks depth, all the story of the world you get is based on the main history most of the NPC don't have dialog and the secondary missions don't provide any lore (except the one from the beggar sect)
4 - Again the power levels don't add up, you have sect elders with outstanding and disciples with the same level if its only the main character it is not a problem but ""normal"" disciples with the same power level as an elder is a big no.


About the game:

1 - You cant choose which NPC you want to romance (if you want to romance any)
2 - Too little missions or history about your companions
3 - Too little cultivation methods and too easy to get the orange and red methods. I would say that to get the good ones you just dot have to get up the affinity it would be better to do some mission or something for the sect
4 - The missions a lot of time are meh
5 - Too litle NPC with something special to do.

And a couple of other points but this were the ones that i considered more important.

i give the game a solid 8/10

Also, I've never really written a decent review here before, but I really need to recommend this one! like it. However, it's not for everyone, for two reasons: it's turn-based and has a very rich wuxia story.  

And I might as well start with a common critique from other players: that the story is convoluted or that something a certain character did doesn't make any sense... And this kind of thing really stems from cultural differences. This game is like a chinese novel come to life, it tells a story of a martial hero, but besides that, it involves all of the Jianghu. <3

(Basically: Jianghu is the community per se of martial artists, and congregates all the sects and schools. And of course it has a code of righteous and stuff, but I digress...)

Anyway, what I mean is that although the game has a lot of characters and things going on at the same time, it's very characteristic and formulaic of this kind of genre. It's kind of confusing at the start, and I really wish there was a glossary, but it's not the developer's fault (except glossary part). It's just that we're not used to this kind of genre or behaviour.

But let's talk about the game stuff:

Gameplay: 7/10
I admit that when I think of Tactics, I imagine something where the terrain and movement can have a big impact on the outcome of the battle, but that's not the case here. My biggest problem is that because it's always the same grid, and I don't have much time to play because of work, I ended up spending a lot of the game fighting on auto mode and at x2 speed. But even though I did that, it didn't make the game seem any less enjoyable to me. Because it was so rewarding to level up my character, upgrade them, learn new moves, and massacre enemies, that I'm just grateful to have those in-game options. Oh, and READ the skill descriptions and distribute your Meridiam points well. And use the game's Spar system, the benefits are amazing.

Visual Presentation: 8/10
The game is beautiful. More diverse than I imagined. It's an indie pixel art game, so there's not much to say there. But I dream of this game becoming a triple-A title, with cutting-edge graphics and real-time action. I'll be following this studio until that becomes a reality..

Audio: 10/10
I could live in the game's start screen. And I wish it had voice acting in certain parts, because I find Chinese music to be both loving and heroic, it would be beautiful to hear the poems out loud.

Story: 8/10
The story doesn't reinvent the wheel. It follows the genre's clichés, and you can see the plot twists from a mile away. And there's an unnecessary romance, because, come on, the other girl is so much more amazing! In any case, that doesn't mean the story is bad. Clichés exist for a reason, and it's always worth it when they're well-crafted, especially in action plots. And the game shines in the longer side quests, which are about the companions.

Overall: 9/10
If you're into this style, just play it, it's one of those games that you want to stop doing things to spend more time with. Of course it's not perfect, but I've genuinely never seen a game that's so complete and polished, with a responsive team that actually makes the changes requested, appear out of nowhere on Steam with such a different proposal from the thousands of others that are out there.

To the developers:
My party was huge, but obviously due to game restrictions, they don't interact much after being summoned. However, it breaks the immersion in some points of the story where you're getting beaten up and alone, because in reality you have a full team with you. So, maybe, in specific game missions, a disclaimer that your group cannot enter a certain place and is waiting at the nearest inn?

There is something good hidden under all of this but right now I can't keep playing.

If I had to rate it out of 10, I'd give it an 8.6. Nothing too bad, there are just a few things that I think should be fixed and worked on.

First, I think some glitches need some work. For example, some quests tell you to talk to someone and it doesn't work when you do talk to them. Another glitch that happened to me was after a long cutscene my game would glitch and not allow me to progress in the story. This causes me to go to a previously saved file.

Second, the story. [spoiler] I don't like the ending. I feel like the end didn't let us know much. It didn't bring justice to Yuwen's story and it left some things untouched For example, the secret areas in the Wudang sect and other places like Shaolin Temple. The ending felt plain and rushed. Please add more to the ending after to fight and beat Mowen[/spoiler]

Third, this game should have a wiki or a website that leads the players through the side quest. Another option could just be to notify the player and say something like ""Moqi has been looking down lately. You should talk to him and see what's going on."" This could help the player engage in more side quests.  It should let you explore more after you beat Mowen. 

Lastly, I think they could warn on what level/Rank (For example, Invinsible, Unrivaled or Outstanding) you should be at before you start a quest because people like me rush the story and beat it before we explore and get as strong as we can. This could be a feature on the map system that the add that tells you what rank you should be before you go to a certain area.

To conclude, this game is solid and has lots of potential and I love the fact that some parts are challenging. (This might be because I rush the story). Just needs some more tuning and a few DLCs that add on to the story or add a new map (PLEASE DROP AT LEAST 2 DLCs) Note: Sorry if my English is bad.

The story is what you expect of wuxia stories: a tale of heroism, chivalry, war, comradeship, betrayal and of course, revenge. This game come with beautiful HD2D style, interchangeable combat system: turn-based or real time.

The premise of main character started very weak with below average stat than most NPC, then as you learn more cultivation skills, your character developed into one of the strongest character is also interesting, though it requires quite the amount of grinding (thankfully at least dev provide you with real time auto battle).

I have put in about 30 hours at the time of this review.  To start, I grew up playing rpgs, I love Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, and have fallen in love with the 2.5 3D style that Octopath Traveler brought. Wandering Sword is such a breath of fresh air for the genre.

The Story:
 I have yet to complete the story, but so far it has been a blast! I enjoy the originality, the progression, and the way the story builds upon itself. The story compliments the world and vice versa. The characters are charming and interesting. I'm becoming emotionally invested in how things turn out for a few of my merry band of martial artists! 

The combat:
 It is a familiar tactical style turn based style (can be done in real time too!), but has its own complexity and customization. The different weapon styles mixed with different types of martial arts can really deliver different play styles. My current play style is the Wudang Sword Style (original I know lol). Basically High movement, Stick and move. Some enemies don't even get a chance to hit me >:D. I would really like to see more weapons/styles added, but there is still plenty to explore!

The World:
 Oh man where to start. The music, the towns, the bamboo forests.. The world is beautiful. It is further complimented by the amazing music and sounds. The open world ""map style"" traversing is kept alive with civilians, merchants, and martial artists walking about that can be interacted with!

The Progression/reward:
 This is what honestly makes the story/gameplay so good. The reward system. The more you play/explore, the stronger you get. As mentioned in previous reviews, the main character feels weak in comparison to his fellow martial artists in the beginning. As you play and find more advanced martial arts you slowly rise the ranks in your sect and become more powerful, and its so rewarding. When I was a trainee I felt as though I could barely fight 1 enemy and I was very underwhelming. Now after investing time into exploring and finding martial artists to teach me powerful martial arts and skills, I am usually the strongest one in my party (EAT THAT MOWEN!). Almost everyone you can interact with you can learn or get something from. It's such a good system!

The Price:
 My usual rule of thumb is 1 hour of gameplay per $1 I spend. Obviously there are plenty of exceptions to this rule. If a game is a master piece in my eyes that rule doesn't apply. But even a mediocre game can be justified by my 1:1 ratio. This game is one of the positive exceptions. Not only did it excel in terms of time/money, but it provided such a memorable experience honestly the price made it fall into my ""Must Buy Hidden Gems"" category.

Suggestions:
 This game is a gem.The biggest thing I'd like to see is an easier way to change your formation and have more control over it. Other than that I'll list some random things I thought would be cool. More character customization, different robes for every rank or just fun skin changes. I'd like to see the ability to join or learn from other Sects through quest line (maybe in a expansion ;D). More tutorials: Better break down of things like, Affinity/relationships, Stats (I know you can see this but took me a minute to find the description). A world map (I believe this is already being worked on). Difficulty Settings, improved AI in combat. Most of these things I believe have been mentioned by the Devs already.

Verdict:
 A must buy! If you enjoy turn based RPGs, Chinese martial arts, and a gripping story. This game is for you. Fun, challenging at times, rewarding for hard work, and easy to invest emotion in during the story. As mentioned in another comment the legit downside to this game is that there is not more of it. I look forward to more from these developers and will continue to recommend this game to anyone who sees it!

The Balance is all over the place though, here's my recommendation:
-You only get stronger by getting cultivation methods (gifting NPC items and sparing them or consulting them and then buying them when your friendly enough with them)
-BUT, if you cherry pick cultivation methods off of every NPC you see you quickly become way way way too strong and it's really really dumb.
-Sooo, get strong before the 'sword appreciation ceremony,' then do NOT get every cultivation method you find in the game off of NPC's because your going to be wayyyy too OP. After sword appreciation ceremony only use cultivations that are given too you.

Starting from nothing and building our own martial artist, using the technique that you prefer, among different weapon types, martial art methods. As someone who likes character stats and building, im having an amazing time.

The graphic look like Octopath Traveller, but they worked really hard to be 'inspired' and not copy. The cities are beautiful, the sprites are all unique, there's really a feeling of immersion into that world. Each character have their own defined personality and spirituality.

It takes a bit of time before your character gets really strong where you can start challenging a lot of people, but the journey was well worth it.

My desires for the future :
- More similar games by the similar team
- A bit more work on the localization, sometimes terms did not translate well from the chinese I think and it can be confusing for people who have less knowledge about Wuxia'n stories.
- More strong optional challenges
- More 'paths' similar to ogre tactics, where you can change completely the story depending on which faction you align with. There were paths in the games, but most are self contained decisions that will not change the whole story.

Updates have been regular.

The Lead starts out weaker compared to the others (makes sense, he's talented but has no combat training at all) but he has several advantages that at about halfway point of the game puts him well above the other characters in strength.

Lead Character Advantage
1.) Can learn skills from characters directly through consulting. (companions can only learn them from books)
2.) Can learn any weapon. I hope they can add the ability to swap weapons mid battle since the game encourages you to focus on one. Though Mastery builds up damage given and reduces damage received so it's so useful if ya have the points to spare.

Tips
1.) Hold onto the skill books for weapons and cultivations. This is the only way for your companions to learn skills which how you get stronger in this game. They also only use 1 weapon type unlike the main.

2.) crafting is powerful. Equipment can have affixes on top of their base stats. Once you have a blueprint you're able to craft an item at it's max rarity which means the most affixes. This can literally double the effective strength of the equipment.

3.) Recruitable characters can be missed. So be thorough or use a guide if this is something that bothers you immensely.

4.) real time combat can let you defeat opponents way stronger then yourself though certain key battles will force turn based. There are also fights that can be lost but you get rewards for ""beating"" them so the game rewards you for that. So the typical lost events don't feel as bad because of this. Some people hate lost events but I really appreciated that detail.

5.) Press M (I used K/B) to zoom out on the world map and see names of surrounding areas.

My only complaint is some of the updated changes only take effect if you make a fresh game so I personally won't be able to enjoy them but you might. ^_^",1694960150,1697639973,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

-stuff new players don't care about below-

I thought the game was fun as is, if I had to throw out some sort of idea for improvement:

Would love to see things fleshed out a little bit more with the pacing and progression, could use some extra thought. I feel like a majority of the game sits around the ""overwhelming"" level, and lots of the lower level stuff is just skipped over almost instantly. And then you jump straight to cap after quickly repeating story mechanics because you had hit the grind a little bit to hard early on when you realize how weak the MC is compared to companions you find. I enjoy the story telling aspect that you are supposed to be weak at first, but something still just feels off with the progression rate, because your buddies are not weak, and they will start allowing you to steam roll anywhere you want to go.

I get there is an open world feeling that feels nice and enticing, but its hard to gauge what to dive into without ruining the difficulty, but also not feeling like you will skip stuff. I was pretty worried about missing content, so I went places I shouldn't had. Maybe just making companion quests a little more obvious, or some sort of clue about time sensitive content would be nice. I get you can easily complete the game without most or any of the extra party members, I just like getting all the story lines in one run if possible.

Still really enjoyed the concepts present in this game, and happily became unrivaled and destroyed a thousand bandits when i was only supposed to fight ten. Really just my two cents if they made similar games in the future.",1697606389,1697606389,True,1,0,0.505434811115264893,0,True,False,False

The game is fun, the story is not 100% my cup of tea (I'd chalk that up to cultural differences I guess?) but it was fine. The main character never really had a motivation I felt compelled by past the very early stages of the game. The MC quickly gives up their original goal at the end of the tutorial and kind of just does what everyone else tells them to do, with their morality occasionally causing them to just do what they were told, but better. I was kind of let down by the point in the game where [spoiler]the MC is framed and is on the run[/spoiler] as that was near the end and felt a bit too late, and I think could have been explored more or used sooner. The set piece fight following it was fun though, it showed how far you've really come and how strong the MC was by that point.

However, [spoiler]I feel the game really baited me into thinking this was going to be about a slow quest of revenge and righteousness to rescue your dead master's daughter, where you slowly work your way through the ranks of the Villain Valley and the Gang, with you being able to choose and join a sect (or multiple?) to get both training, and get help for a big final battle or something. Oh well, maybe next game?[/spoiler]

Visually it's pretty great. The animations are good and I've always loved this type of pixel 2.5D art style. I would like some animations for side attacks (as it stands, they attack only to the left or right visually) but it's a very minor complaint. I wish the art style in the video on the store page was used more in game, I think it'd really add something to the game where it otherwise only uses pixel animations and sprites (which again, I like and think are pretty well done).

The actual mechanics to the game are interesting, but I think they could have been explored in more depth. Currently, it's largely ""bigger number wins"" with not a whole lot of tactics to play around. The most it comes down to is circling the enemy to get back and side attacks while the enemy stands in place since they never move if you end your turn next to them. I would LOVE to see this idea again with less emphasis on gear and learning as many moves as possible and more focus on the synergy between moves, along with better balance between weapon types because the story HEAVILY pushes swords over pretty much anything else, and I think hidden weapons have a LOT of very easily missed teachers, leaving you with very few options in terms of moves i.e.

I think the only thing I disliked about the combat past the early game was occasionally you'd run into a fight, and you'd handily win and the game would treat it like a loss or near loss. Personally, I'm not a fan of winning a fight only to be told you're actually losing. I feel having fights where the player feels they're doing really well only to have them lose or be defeated outside of the battle is more annoying than if the powerful enemy was actually powerful and just took you down in a single hit or two, or a cutscene plays out showing you were vastly outclassed or something.

And to touch on the early game a bit, I'd recommend spending a good bit more time on it to ensure a smoother progression experience. Early on you just kinda run around and avoid fights until the game hands you a (temporary) overpowered companion that can clear everything for you.

The game is definitely playable on steam deck... but it has some rough spots with the controls not quite being optimized or configured for controllers it seems. I ran into multiple issues where it was very hard to check move details requiring some weird combination of selecting a different skill so I could then examine the moves, but it seems like there was a patch part way through my play through which helped it a bit. The inventory is still a nightmare to navigate, and having B be the default text advance is a little weird though.

Basically, I think this is definitely worth playing, and I hope the developers expand on their ideas here in the future. I feel like the lack of balance towards the mid/end game (or sooner depending on how much you grind) holds it back from being truly great. Despite all my complaints/criticism, I really am looking forward to whatever the devs make next!

I will give a content warning heads up that the narrative has so far had a lot of sexual menace toward women in it. As of yet, it's never been on screen assault, and I've always had the ability to intervene, and it's not the only plot for women in the game by far, but it is a factor to consider before buying. I am hoping if it continues to be a plot element we will see more active involvement from the people targeted by that violence in their stories, rather than just ""bad people do this thing and we have stopped it problem is over"". 

That's the only concern/warning I have so far though! Otherwise I have really really enjoyed my time with this and find the writing to be very charming.

Updated notes: The writing as I continue to play through has only gotten better and better. I appreciate the grounded narrative focus despite the supernatural elements, and the attention paid to the root cause of various problems as they occur. This is a really special game, and as the translation is further refined and small amendments are made the devs have done a wonderful job of demonstrating they care for the world they have created and the wellbeing of their audience. Big recommend here!

editing my review again: I'm a narrative designer, and after witnessing multiple endings this game has one of the most compelling narrative structures I've seen in a long time. I've seen some complaints that Yuwen Yi is a very passive protagonist, but that's determined by if you play him that way. A lot of choices in this game are not handled within dialogue, but by where you choose to go and spend your time. While some prompts and direct hints would be helpful for many people and I am not averse to them existing at all because it's very easy to miss things, I think it would be great if that was a toggle you can opt into, because discovering things organically via paying attention and showing initiative in where I chose to go on the map and *that* informing the endings I got rather than dialogue trees was a really interesting way to approach adding depth and replayability to this that's also very very clever for resource conservation from a development perspective.

I do not have much experience with wuxia as a genre, but I enjoyed Jade Empire and Total War 3 Kingdoms, and so I knew the potential a setting like this could have. The overall length and depth of the game for its presumed budget is impressive.

The art style is what caught my attention first, and although Octopath traveler certainly defined the 2.5d pixel style in recent times, this game certainly still stands out and looks good. There are many set pieces and areas that have no major story significance and yet are beautifully crafted and are enjoyable to just take in and look at.

It definitely feels like an Eastern RPG in that grinding, while not strictly required, is clearly expected and even encouraged. Thankfully, there is an option between real-time battling and turn-based, as well as an Auto-battle and Speed Increase setting to get through the trivial fights to earn your martial points and crafting ingredients. Still, despite many of the side-quests being fetch or kill quests, I was impressed with some of the more story-focused questlines as they take you to multiple locations in a region and introduce you to important characters that can become party members or can teach you new techniques. Also, each stage of the main quest that is completed has the potential to unlock new areas and new quests that were originally off-limits, which means it's important to take breaks from the main story and look around for new content.

Collecting and upgrading your moves and finding your own preferred fighting style is probably the most interesting part. While at times, it felt like the distribution of moves was biased toward a certain style of play (sabers early on, swords later), you have the option of championing any or all of the five primary weapon styles. But, it's really on you how far you go to collect and build your arsenal. I liked that some very powerful techniques and equipment were only able to be acquired if the player went out of their way to gift and spar with masters of other sects, giving rewards that would otherwise not be given via the main story. It's also possible to learn moves from your own sect early, before they are given to you through the main storyline, which is cool in its own way. 

The only unfortunate part is that by the time you start unlocking the unique and centerpiece moves that really pull your build together, the game is basically over. And again, in my experience, I felt like grinding was absolutely necessary to build up these moves and for building my skill trees, and I wouldn't have felt anywhere near as powerful without a lot of time spent building martial points and hunting down cultivation methods for more meridian points (skill points).

A few things I'd like to see in the future:
* Some form of NG+ where you can keep your moves, save for maybe the story related ones, and reset them all to level 1. That way, if a player wants to be an accomplished fist or hidden weapon user from the start, they don't have to wait and go out of their way to certain areas or corners of the map after the tutorial just to find some relevant manuals, or grind affection with masters and spar with them. Also, as I understand it the cultivator genre often has reincarnation of powerful characters into weaker bodies as a trope, so it's not like NG+ wouldn't make sense mechanically.

* Changing the 'Load Game' menu to having your Latest Save on top instead of the Auto Save. It happened at least twice where I lost small amounts of progress and drove myself insane as I told myself I'd already done certain things until I realized the topmost option is the Auto save instead of my manual save.

* An option to change my sprite's outfit. It can just be an additional slot somewhere on the character portrait, maybe in the upper right or left, and in that slot you can click to add specific clothing items that are un-sellable and are only acquired through quest progression. We already have the default outfit and then the Wudang outfit. It would be nice if we could 'collect' outfits that reflect each of the different sects like Shaolin, Xuanhuo Cult, etc. 

This would be a nice compromise since there is definitely an appeal to wanting to fully join other sects instead of Wudang, either because of their aesthetic or because you prefer their characters or morality, but that would require too much work. Allowing outfits that only change the player's aesthetic but otherwise don't change stats or story is a good thing.

* It would be nice if it was a bit more obvious how to progress certain companion stories. Lu Xan'er (spelling) for example, doesn't have a quest log for her final story bit, which makes it very difficult to tell where to go. Also, more interactivity with companions regarding side content or main quests would be nice. Just some dialogue is necessary, otherwise it's very strange how they loyally follow you everywhere but have no interest or comment.

* I'd really like tooltips that give more context to character names, places, and other important vocabulary during the story. At first, I thought this was a thing since the game highlighted certain important names in yellow, but if you mouse over them, nothing happens. I think if you mouse over the word, a little tooltip to should show up and give one or two sentences to remind you of the person/place/thing's significance in the story. Personally I found the names of many characters hard to memorize and so certain conversations were hard to follow and understand what was happening, and there were also times where characters were referred to by different names based on who was talking. Just a little blurb that says something like ""Master Qingxu is the man who saved Yuwen Yi in the Outer Lands. He is the righteous sect leader of Wudang.""",1697520954,1697521069,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's especially difficult to find an officially-translated Chinese wuxia RPG with solid gameplay stunning art, music, etc. That said, having an initial interest in Chinese wuxia makes me a bit biased, though I think the game strikes a good balance in interesting both Chinese wuxia fans and those new to the genre.

My only complaint, which has been mentioned by multiple other reviewers, is the quality of the English translations. It's generally serviceable but struggles especially with poetic language. Unfortunately, many of the more emotional and impactful moments tend to use poetic language, so the overall story (for English players) suffers because of this. I don't have any great ideas for this; translating poetry is notoriously difficult, and understanding Chinese poetry generally requires historical and cultural knowledge. A possible fix to just improve readability could be to move away from rhyming and translating sentences more literally. Sticking to a rhyme scheme for poetry sections results in awkward word choice, and there are multiple instances where finding a rhyme was clearly the priority, instead of conveying the substance. Besides this, a general pass for grammar and syntax could help as well. Just some random thoughts from someone's who's worked as a Chinese-English translator!

The RPG mechanics work well however, it is VERY easy. The art is nice, the game plays smoothly. If you want an RPG this game is more quality than many.

That being said it has a lot of flaws. It is very easy to make your character way stronger than the story forces your character to be. Which is a shame because the game caps how strong you can get through grinding by tying so much power to your cultivation techniques. If you don't get more cultivation techniques it doesn't matter how hard you grind because your stats won't go up. Unfortunately your MC can get a LOT of cultivation techniques, especially compared to your companions, which allows you to become very strong by the mid-game compared to what you're supposed to be. So many times in the game you will likely be way stronger than your opponent only for the game to tell you that you are actually weaker than them and you actually lost the fight or didn't win at least. This does create somewhat of a strong disconnect between what's happening in the story and what's happening in the game mechanics which is very unfortunate and I feel could have been handled better.

Some other issues. Most side-quests are just fetch quests. Cooking as a crafting mechanic seems pointless and is a time waste. The materials you need to level cooking take SO long to farm and require so much backtracking to refill stamina. In the meantime you can just grind human enemies at farming spots on auto-battle and get tons of money to then just buy food. Not to mention you heal a little bit after every fight if you take no damage meaning healing food is really pointless after a while. 

So after all of this you might be asking, ""OKay so why do you recommend it?"" Well it's still competently made and despte the flaws I enjoyed it. If you want an RPG this is probably better than most on steam for the cost.

-Huo Changqing (the lady u recruit at fancheng city)
-Ye Fei (the guy u recruit at lotus lake)
-Di Zui (the saber monk)

The quest revolving have massive holes(Ye Fei's recruitment quest and DI Zui are the biggest offenders of this)  and and their affection are hard capped at a certain level. That leaves one some moves the MC would not be able to learn.

In addition the following quest leave open holes in the plot line.
Spoilers below**
-Ye Fei's recruitment quest has one mysterious dude show up and then disappears forever!??
-sweet and bitter springs side quest (a prerequisite to recruit Di Zui) is one of the best and well written side quests, With the right squadmates, you can trigger a hidden boss fight Karma monk. However, if you manage to win this absurdly hard fight, Karma somehow escapes and is never to be seen again. It would be better to have another quest with Karma to wrap up DI Zui's chapter. 
-Physician Association and the herbalist fairy. These 2 are mentioned in a side quest involving DaoXuan but there is no way to trigger it. Judging from the yellow text when these 2 are mention, it is more than likely that they are intended for a quest.
-Jiang XianTong's wodden toy sword seems bugged as i'm not able to even return it.

Suggestions for future quest:
A) Ye Fei follow up quest line-tying the mysterious stranger to Tianji Palace and practising the quietus devilry martial skill. The mysterious stranger paid a price to practice quietus devilry and is similar to DongFang BuBai, the infamous character from JingYong's novel. Reward being a quest item quietus devilry to resolve Xun YaoYao's fate
B) -Di Zui/Karma follow up quest: Karma being the one responsible for instigating the rebellion at Wuxian Sect. Investigate the clues and track him down.
C) Physician Association and the herbalist fairy quest: To find the legendary herbalist and cure Moli.
D) Xun YaoYao folllow up quest: to have a choice to give her the full quietus devilry to master, or have the legendary herbalist cure her and lose all her skills. If she learns the full quietus devilry, she shows up in B) but dies in the process.

Story: It's a very basic Murim story. MC is out on revenge and does Murim things. There's multiple endings but it's all very anti-climatic and feels super rushed. The side stories are pretty interesting and most side-quests have fun stories. The companion quests are also all pretty good. Also, the translation is decent enough but there's definitely some hiccups here and there.

Music: You'll be listening to the same tracks for most of the game. They fit the setting well, I just wish there was more. Also, it feels odd that there's no track that plays when you rest at an inn or at your sect. 

Sound: The sound design that is there is great. The issue is that there's many large battle scenes where you have supposedly hundreds of warriors fighting and you barely hear anything.

Animation: Nothing too crazy. The animation for your different sword/fist/etc moves are all cool, but again it feels like there's something missing from the world.

Graphics: It's a mix between sprites for characters and 3D textures for everything else. The sprites are great, the rest of the world is okay.

Setting: It's Murim. You're in Ancient China and everything you expect have there is there. One down side is that it never really felt necessary to explore the world. I can think of two instances where I decided to go off the regular path and found something interesting or useful.

RPG/Cultivation: There is no level, but there is a pseudo-ranking based on your stat totals. You raise your stats in 4 ways: items, learning martial arts, meridians, and pills. You can craft/find/be rewarded items. Martial arts can be found through sparring, the main story, side-quests, and occasionally in the wild. You upgrade your meridians through points that you get from upgrading cultivation arts and pills. Pills for stats can be crafted, found, or rewarded. There's a lot of ways to build you character and break the game. For instance, my lead went down the swordplay path and was built around evasion and health - basically made it so I could tank hits from people several ranks up. It's a lot of fun seeing the progress you can make in fights... kinda.

Combat: Undoubtedly the worst part about the game. You'll probably find yourself auto-battling a lot... But if you don't, you have 6 different tabs with 4 skills in each tab that you can use in a fight. The first four are your damaging skills, then you have your lightness art, and then your cultivation art. Lightness and Cultivation Arts break the game, and allow you to do some pretty disgusting things to enemy NPCs. There are many powerful NPCs but they NEVER use their lightness or cultivation arts! It trivializes a lot of fights because you can just stack powerful buffs that they will never have. On top of that, the AI doesn't chase down low targets and only focuses on who's right next to them. Which means that you can send your tankiest character onto someone and then just pelt them from 6 rows back with hidden weapons. The AI needs some serious work.

Crafting: Crafting and other ""world skills"" exist, but you'll only need to interact with them for a few quests. You can train them individually and/or use other people as trainers. You don't really need to push crafting to its limits, but you can make some broken items with it. 

All in all, I have a lot of critiques but I really enjoyed my time with the game. If you like Wuxia settings, you'll probably really enjoy this. The devs have been consistently updating so who knows what they have in the future.",1697060239,1697419253,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The sprite work, animations, and world design is top notch. Even found myself just standing still in certain places just to admire the scenery and spot all the background details (favorite so far being a panda happily munching on some bamboo across a river in the Bamboo Sea). 

Gameplay wise I'm a big fan of the grid-based tactical combat, with facing and flanking being important for maximizing damage. The leveling up experience has been very enjoyable so far and it's always a treat to find a new big move for each of your characters.

The studio is also very receptive to feedback and have actively implemented good suggestions from players. Their responses are, honestly, some of the most considerate and humble I've seen in the industry. One such response is what convinced me to try the game.

A few points of clarification: The game's store page suggests ""turn based strategy, real time battles"" is an appropriate descriptor for the game. It is not. The real time function lacks the balance and polish of their turn based gameplay and seems to be more of a tool to help the player quickly get through battles in areas they've outgrown while going from place to place.

The game is primarily a turn-based tactics rpg, so I'd go into it with that in mind.

The UI has a few hiccups. When buying items you can't see how many of that item you already possess. When gathering items you only see the name, when receiving items from battle you only see the picture, and the items only show as pictures in the inventory until you hover over them.

And there are a ton of items.

That can be a little difficult to navigate when doing quests to find ingredients or, especially in the early and mid game, when trying to craft new gear. The quests tend to be very satisfying to complete, though, and the crafting system is very rewarding once you've got a good grip on it, so I consider that worthwhile.

Quests influence the world in ways that will not be apparent from the quest reward screen. Some quests can be completed in ways other than those listed on the objective list. Your dialogue options seem to matter quite a bit to who can be recruited and who will ultimately survive the narrative.

Given how living the world of Wandering Sword is, I urge you to go into it without reloading a save each time an event doesn't go your way (narratively, that is, do reload if you get murdered, or, say, jump off a particularly high precipice without the requisite skills to survive) and to allow the story to flow as you make it.

The skills can be a bit opaque in their wording, and there are an awful lot of them, but their variety gives you the freedom to make your warriors the way you wish to, for good or ill. Coming up with imaginative combinations of moves and cultivation techniques to give my team synergy was a joy. If I have a complaint, it's that the latter part of the game can be trivialized if you're a bit too good at understanding those systems and how they interact with one another. I would enjoy a longer endgame with a bit more bite in the competition.

Mild translation errors (and they truly are quite mild despite a few reviews to the contrary) are a truly minor burr in the blanket, and I had no difficulty thoroughly enjoying the experience.

While I wish I had the ability to play as a female MC and to woo the honestly awesome dudes of this game, I still had a lot of fun even without knowing much about wuxia/cultivation ahead of time. I loved many (though not all) of the characters, the interesting and twisty storyline where more and more secrets are revealed over time, the unique ""leveling up"" system of the game where you get stronger as you trick people into teaching you their special techniques, and the amazing open world and ability to pick up so many different quests. I really enjoyed my time with this game.

However, I have three major issues with it.

1) Trying to get meridian points is a major grind and limiting factor to how strong you can get. By the end of the game, I was sitting on about 100,000 martial points but couldn't do more than max out 2 meridian bars. It was honestly ridiculous and I wish there was some way to convert martial points to meridian points. 

2) The ending was really unsatisfying. I guess I got the relatively good ending where [spoiler]after I beat Mowen in our one-on-one duel, I had enough regard with him to let him live. Then my MC just limps off after telling Mowen he will always keep Mowen from killing others and... that's it? We never find out what happens to Mowen? We just see two quick flashes of other folks, don't even figure out what happens to our party members who were ride-or-die with us the whole time, and then end on some goofy romance with the personality-less main girl? It is SUCH an anti-climactic ending that left me feeling kinda bummed out this magnificent journey ended with such a hollow thud.[/spoiler]

3) The romance with Miss Ouyoung is hilariously unconvincing. I mean, technically you CAN romance other girls but she's the main one - for freak's sake, she's even on the starting page and is clearly meant to be the 'canon' romance you get if you play the game normally without trying to get other endings. But she's got all the personality of a cardboard box and it is hilariously unconvincing that the MC falls in love with her after [spoiler]knowing her for literally one night when they were kids[/spoiler] and after about three days of in-game time. She's very much the developers trying to make Fetch happen. It's a small point but still pretty irritating in the end.",1697298590,1697298590,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As a fan of wuxia growing up, I was delighted to see the references and the setting the story took place in. I cracked a smile at the typical tropes played and felt nostalgia, knowing how certain poisons would get resolved.

The combat is good, pretty standard strategy rpg style (I played turn-base, didn't try RTS yet). I like the artistic direction the game has. I also like that it doesn't hold your hand and it feels open from the very beginning. All of that, I appreciate the heck out of. It made me feel wonder in exploring. Eventually, the story got too good and I abandoned a lot of that but I appreciated it.

The story was very Condor Heroes inspired I must say. The protagonist was very much Guo Jing/Zhang Wuji like, though my favorite was always Yang Guo. The side recruitable characters were nice, some of them felt incomplete though, but to be fair I did not get a chance to see them all. On my second play-thru, I will certainly be looking out for it.

Things I didn't enjoy: I would have liked a faster travelling method to be added at least by mid-game. Maybe I missed it, but walking got tiresome. Or at least a feature for a one button auto-walk would be nice.

I'm not sure if there is a higher difficulty, I don't remember from the beginning, but I would love to do it if available. If not, devs should definitely add it on. After collecting forty cultivations, the game got a bit easy. So I think I will be doing self challenges on my next playthrough.

Cons:
Somewhat hard to follow for western audiences, largely due to the era and names.
Missing a decent bit of QoL improvements.
Game feels a bit cheap at times.
Lots of small sub-stories, some great some just okay.
Tutorial doesn't hold your hand and like many old JRPGs, there's hidden mechanics in the game to understand if you want make good builds
Ai for autobattles is lacking any depth

Pros:
Level progression and builds feel good! It's a fairly long game, level progression is a bit on the slower side but you're always improving. Best part of the game for me. Your MC starts off weak, everyone seems better but before you realize it, your MC is the most busted thing in existence.

Great character design with great stories. They feel cool, interesting and different from one another.

There are missable characters and a couple with very specific things to do to recruit them. Some recruitment guides are even missing a couple of characters due to this!

Becomes an open world very early into the game which allows exploring a large portion of the game (some regions still locked by quests)


Overal:
Has a very good nostalgic JRPG feel to an era I miss. I can completely see why this game would be a turn off to many people, but once you get a bit into the game, it ends up really drawing you in.

Example being Path of Wuxia and Blades of Jianghu no signs of beggar sect I can definitely see wudang and tangmen inspiration. I'm excited for future installments and new releases for the developer. Maybe one where you can create your own male or female protagonist/antagonist with choice matters. A Xinxia expansion would also be a really cool idea I think, reaching the peak of martial arts and take a step into immortality. Long story short I highly recommend this game if your looking for good wuxia representation and a good old effort = reward experience.

some gripes i have with this game:
1. some storylines feels unfinished(e.g [spoiler]Kama Cult questline, curing Moli, finding herbal saint Shang Tingzhu, the pili weapon smuggling sidequest, snake envoy's rebellion,to  name a few. Seriously though, is it unfinished or we players just havent found it yet? dev pls answerr :)[/spoiler] )
2. some places in the map feels underutilized, or straight up placeholder (e.g Yu VIllage, Villain Valley, and most of Nanjiang region) - kinda unfortunate since these are all beautiful places rife with potential lores
3. some random NPCs having their affinity capped (e.g that one staff wielding kid from the western area has his affinity capped at 40), implying that there are further stories with them
4. some beautiful, unique character with their own sprites being sidelined as  city fillers without any story significance
5. lots of forbidden areas thats unaccessible even until the very end

画面值得诟病，交互细节各种缺失，手柄体验痛苦，steam deck体验痛苦（分辨率和字太小）
初期文本较为生硬容易劝退批判向的玩家。结局稍显仓促
但是即使如此，这款游戏在我心里也有95分！
因为除了这些小毛病，这游戏其他的一切都让我感受到巨大的诚意！

三大支线剧情相当好，波澜曲折，合情合理。
大主线也很多值得回味的细节，伏笔埋的好，收的好（当然有少许生硬加进去的东西不过并不影响）。
如果能有更多资源丰富一些路人支线就好了。
个人认为剧情上最大的不足是应当给莫问更多的刻画（尤其是内心）。
刷子方面见仁见智我是刷的很爽，因为反馈频率很高，看到一个什么武功，去刷也就十来分钟就能获得，收获满足感。而这样的不断反馈持续到成为一代宗师为止，都不容易让人厌倦（毕竟那么多绝世神功，每一个都是狂拽酷炫）
战斗上应当是会被大多数玩家批评的，我个人是认为整体系统算不错的，没有等级，并且所有角色都基本符合整体游戏的战力基准，不太割裂，但是基本上前期切磋大法之后后期应该都是和我一样全程即时自动吧。
文本半文半白，虽说也是见仁见智，但应当对大部分玩家来说（身边案例）属于是较好的表现方式。
人物刻画相当丰满！实在是小看制作组的用心程度了，个人对于这方面相当重视，一开始抱着很消极的态度在玩，玩完之后实在是除了莫问，其他角色都相当的饱满，有血有肉，有少数角色的刻画可圈可点（尤其是白锦，冷无情，欲教和涤罪僧），主线的一些情节稍显套路但是避开了一些套路情节的雷。
以上是写给玩家的感受，胡言乱语

致制作组：
A 个人认为严重影响体验的糟糕部分：
    1.分辨率调节，steam deck等小屏幕平台的适配，看到已经加了对白文本字体设定，但是其他的文字小屏幕游玩异常痛苦。
    2.大地图，这个应该已经无数玩家反映过了，笑
    3.手柄操作可以说很地狱了，这个还是得废点劲，比如经脉点用手柄甚至选不到一些节点
    4.结局稍显仓促
    5.一些限时任务的提示，尤其是孔亮
    6.很多资源没用上，比如料理的存在感极低，这个不好弄，但是有精力了希望可以雕琢一下。
B 个人认为较为影响体验，可以酌情考虑的部分：
    1.适当的传送点，见仁见智
    2.部分村落裁缝不能制衣，铁匠不能锻造，这是有意为之？
    3.循环菜单（循环选项，最右边选项再按右理应跳回第一项，否则操作不便捷），道具栏选项上下左右循环。
    4.触发与角色互动的距离太近，可否适当加大（就是不要走的那么近才能触发）
C 个人认为非常值得考虑（就是个人非常希望有），但是可能成本教高（或者有意留作续作内容？）的部分：
    1.剧情方面：
        - 真的，莫问的角色刻画真的太苍白了，而这个角色至关重要！应当给他充足的内心刻画！
        - 宇文逸童年，叔叔的刻画
        - 部分支线剧情的结局（这个可以比如利用fact判断，在大剧情推进之后不同的节点和重大事件后调整路人的对白，在本作已经完成度到这地步的情况下，可以对每个路人角色进行审视）
        - 欲教的后续
    2.大地图上与NPC更多的互动，战斗甚至任务（不过设计整体系统，可能比较麻烦吧）
    3.精力系统可以适当雕琢一下，这游戏对于刷子玩家来说后期就纯卡精力，体验相对有点差（比如找名剑庄主学制衣锻造很痛苦）这个见仁见智，因为本作
    目前为止看来，制造系统其实非常值得深入开发，让它变得很耐玩。首先几乎用心一点的玩家都逃不过制造（毕竟词条），但是制造系统相当粗糙，在当前已经
    有了充足的美术资源和物品资源的情况下，应当更多的雕琢，比如说制造技能，还有回复精力的方式，精力不足时的一些惩罚，制造技能经验的获得比率。就我
    个人而言，包括很多较为功利的玩家，该系统我的玩法就是，全程无视，见人就切磋，拿到比较不错的图纸之后适当弄点材料，然后就去名剑山庄学锻造制衣，一次
    200，还要跑隔壁睡觉，要么就花大价钱买几百个凝神丹，还要点半天。毫无乐趣可言，虽然不扣分，但在现有的内容下进行逻辑上的改造，玩法上的优化，可以让
    这部分变得相当有趣不是吗。

I'm writing this review as a player who has completed the game twice, with over 10 years of experience in the gaming industry, and I'm also involved in game production. My previous review at the time of the game's release was mainly to encourage and praise the studio's achievements. However, I believe I can be more helpful by providing a detailed review that could give the team more ideas for developing this product or the next one, and I'm sorry if I've caused any inconvenience.

1. The story in the game is quite good, but it needs more depth.
The current main plot is fine, but it lacks real pain and joy. For example, in the story, the loss of the uncle is briefly mentioned, but it's not a character closely connected to the player's journey. When reuniting with Xiaotong, the character doesn't express much happiness. If the extremes of sadness and happiness aren't pushed too hard, it can be challenging to evoke emotions. It feels like a typical hero's story without strong emotional engagement.

When thinking about the martial arts theme, it's a genre that might not appeal to many young players. So, it would be beneficial if the story of the martial world could be more complex, moving beyond a simple binary of right and wrong, emphasizing the consequences of choices. If the main story is difficult to change, consider adding more choices to side events or special occurrences. For instance, after defeating the Tianlong Gang, there could be a scene where the player helps the two kids whose parents died in the battle. If they offer a lot of help, the two kids might be at risk of being kidnapped, but if they provide little help, the children could potentially die of hunger. Similarly, with companions, multiple choices could lead to different skill rewards, enhancing replayability and player engagement. More complex > More community > More supporter.

2. About content and character development.
I'm not sure about the current status of the studio's plans, but I think the effort put into the art of the Nanjiang region is on par with the Central Plain. However, there's very little content there, and it's mostly at the end of the storyline. I would like to see more content with each new area being unlocked, creating the feeling of opening up a new continent or world. For example, if there's a chivalrous theme in the Central region, there could be a mix of different types of martial sects or palace intrigues. The stories of resilience or heroism in the Outer Lands, or the mysteries of Nanjiang, would be welcome additions.

The time spent bonding with the female protagonists in the story is limited, there's a lack of events and chemistry, and it's easy to miss events with them if you're not familiar with the exact storyline or what happened in previous playthroughs. Adding voice acting, especially for Yao Ji Ara Ara ~ , would be a significant improvement.

Please don't conclude the game so abruptly. It's like going on a long and exciting journey, only to have an abrupt ending, similar to a traffic accident and the end of a story. At the very least, allow about 10 minutes for relaxation, listening to music, revisiting the highlights of the journey, glimpsing how the characters will continue their lives, or providing credits to acknowledge the incredible people who created this game. The ending currently significantly diminishes the mood.

3. Gameplay and skills.
I believe that enhancing the collection element of the game, such as collecting rare equipment and secret techniques, would be beneficial. Even by the end of the game, the equipment received from NPCs, aside from the Zhanlu sword, is generally inferior to what can be crafted.

To increase replayability, the collection and achievement elements are crucial. However, currently, obtaining skills and equipment in the game is mainly strength-based or story-based (by defeating enemies or following the main plot). It would be much more interesting if there were special events based on choices, actions, or puzzles to unlock hidden techniques. Areas like fishing could be improved by adding mini-game mechanics to enhance enjoyment.

I understand the game is called ""Wandering Sword,"" and the sword is the main weapon. However, it would be fantastic if there were DLCs that expanded skills for other weapons or added more intriguing choices.

You've created a very good game, and I have complete confidence that you can turn it into an excellent game. Keep up the great work, devs. I'll definitely recommend this game to others and support your future projects.",1695423500,1697085729,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
[list]
[*] Great graphics imo.
[*] Very solid soundtrack.  I enjoyed all of the music in the game, although I do wish there were more songs included.
[*] The story was pretty interesting and different from any other game I've played.  The plot does seem like a generic 'wuxia' story if you want an idea of what it is about.  I haven't played any games that leaned into heavily though so I enjoyed it.
[*] It has a unique progression system for making your character stronger.  The main character can learn new skills from becoming friendly with any other martial artists; when their 'affection' is high enough they will be willing to teach you their more powerful techniques.  You learn 'cultivation methods' which will increase your hp/mp and also give you points to spend unlocking your 'meridian points' which is essentially 8 different skill tress which permanently unlock stat boosts or passive skills as you unlock them.  You can also learn combat skills from friendly martial artists which are the active skills in battle.  You can also find tomes which allow you (and any party members) to instantly learn the skill and you can use them for everybody in your group.  This means your main character starts out very weak but can surpass all of the other characters eventually because only the main dude can learn directly from other martial artists without needing tomes.
[*] You can spar anybody who you meet and then take their items.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] The English translation is a bit rough.  All of the menus and descriptions are perfectly fine, but the dialogue pretty often seems like google translate was used.  I could understand everything fine, but the grammar wasn't quite right and it was very obvious that there was not a native English speaker who edited/wrote the dialogue.
[*] Optional recruit-able npc's who don't join your group as part of the the main story are very hit-or-miss.  Some of them have personal quests you can do that will  make them much stronger while it seems like other don't have anything extra after you recruit them so they will stay weak.  Sometimes these characters would have short cut-scenes/dialogue when you went to a new area where they would give you some background on the area.  It was neat when that happened but it seemed to happen with random characters at random times; I would have liked to take the specific characters with me to new places if I knew they would have extra dialogue to add.
[*] Controller support isn't great.  It is workable if you really don't want to use kb+m, but navigating the menus using the controller was annoying enough for me that I switched over to kb+m about halfway through the game.
[/list]

Overall I think I would give it an 8.5/10.  I really enjoyed all of the progression systems in place to help you become the greatest martial arts master.",1696995887,1696996068,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 There are a lot of side quests, some of them hidden or requiring obscure triggers. 
 There are a lot recruitable characters, each with their own quest. Some can only be recruited at specific story points, so you might miss them if you just breeze through the story. One even requires you to recruit all other characters. Honestly, recruiting feels like Suikoden 1&2, just with a smaller cast, and most of them don't really impact the main story. The only thing that annoys me is failing to recruit a character because your affection with them is too high.
 There are multiple endings; there are at least 5. Sadly, the differences between endings are mostly just one extra scene, not worth the time to replay the game from the beginning.
The story is linear, but most of your choice matters. Characters could dies, exiled or even betray you depend on your action. 
 Grinding is not really necessary If you go around looking for party members or side quests, the experience from fighting random mobs there kinda enough to maxing all your skill,
 The art style is HD-2D like Octopath, so it feels like a retro RPG with updated graphics.

Some improvements that I am hoping for in the future: 
1. Improved AI combat system. I am not a coder by any means, so unsure how difficult it would be to add AI presets for each character. If a system like FF12's gambit system was in place, that would be huge! As I get older (24), I am beginning to enjoy watching the flow of battle after customizing the characters, rather than spending additional time to choose every action. I definitely appreciate the game asking if you would like to proceed in turn based/real time prior to difficult battles. 
2. Meridian points, it would be nice if you could just refund 1 point at a time! 
3. Overworld map - Having an overlay could be nice, but not really needed.

EDIT:

Roughly 80 hours of playtime now. I can say for certain i haven't played such a meaningful and well crafted exp/martial points system since the original ff7 (My favourite game of all time) 

I am a freaking super kungfu master, sword swinging baddass.

I am also now in the badlands (later part of game i presume)...got a badass unstoppable team that i grinded to get there, not to mention that i managed to gather every masters final cultivation ability barring shaolin masters one upto this point, dude is old but a damn baddass himself. Game has a auto battle of sorts that allows you to be basically afk except for map movement, its wicked sick for grinding and getting the EXP/martial points needed for levelling abilities/skills/moves.  

This is not an ordinary EXP system. Its a rather a vast but not stupidly so collection of skills/abilities/moves that you level up which many come naturally with just a little exploring. They provide general stats to your characters when you level them...get it? So every master you meet you wanna get strong enough to kick their butts gain their respect and thusly access to their skills. Going for the big outlaws and criminals now out here in the badlands, already making a name for myself...

its Pixel based and 2.5D. Beautifully done, music is also so fitting for the game. Again, best i have heard for a game of this kind since ff7 original. Simple, elegant and robustly aggressive when battling.

I am an instant fan.


Final Edit : Cannot go back into your game when the game ends after beating the final boss.

The background of this game is based on a typical world of Chinese Martial Art.  The story itself is comparably better than the ones from Octopath I/II (Personal opinion) as this game is more focus on only one main character without lengthy introduction on other side characters.

The graphic is pretty comfortable as beautiful as Octopath.

The main story is focus and may be around 20 hours more or less, and combat is challenging if you do not do some grindings.  The side stories of other characters mostly quite straightforward but still good to walk through, where some of them are actually lengthy and quite surprisingly good/well-written.

I love reading wuxia novels, and i would say, that this game depicts quite well how it would feel to be able to be a protagonist in one of those wuxia novels i like. Since tale of wuxia, i haven't been able to find another game in this genre, which is as polished and also with very decent translations, This game hits almost all my tick-boxes for a wuxia game, which allows you to build your own character, who is very average at the start of the game to the point of being unrivaled in the world of wuxia in central plain.

If i have to complain, it would be about the post game / ending. First of all, it would be great to be able to also see the endings of all the characters, who have been following us around and have been fighting at our side all this time. Secondly, it is really a pity that the game doesn't allow you to move around in the world map again to continue grinding, or visiting the other characters or doing whatever i want with my unrivaled power after the end. The game just showed you some cut scenes, then a black 'the end' screen and booted you to the main menu, with the last save being right before the final battle. It feels very anti-climatic, for me at least.

All in all, a quite satisfying wuxia experience worth my bucks. Thank you very much for the developers to create a game in this genre and with good translations, despite the market never exactly been very promising for this kind of genre.

If you don't already have a strong interest in cultivation and martial arts themed fantasy writing from manhua like Tales of Demons and Gods, there are a lot of terms and ideas that may make something like this harder to keep up with as the game's power system is geared more towards mastering cultivation methods than leveling up and a lot of terms are carried over that may be confusing for newcomers to the genre. On top of this, the menus can feel clunky, the English is a bit off at times, how your power level is determined isn't immediately clear, and paths to progression are only obvious if you are using a sword as a weapon in the early game. 

But if you enjoy wuxia, you're probably already used to translation errors and have already gotten used to a lot of the ideas and terminology, in which case, this game is a great chance to enjoy the typical wuxia storyline in game format rather than as a manhua or novel. I think this is a pretty solid pick-up for anyone who enjoys the genre and a good first game for the developers. I think there is plenty of room for improvement, but will be keeping an eye out for any future games made by these devs in case they want to continue creating games in the genre, especially with English translations to help Western fans enjoy them as the English translations are pretty solid, just having the occasional grammatical errors or strange diction. 

For RPG fans, this still might be a good game as a gateway to wuxia, as there are a lot of features that can scratch the collectionist itch for people who like to explore and take their time in RPGs. There is a decently large map with around 20 towns/cities strewn throughout it. Most have a few side quests, including a few major questlines. Most NPCs can be interacted with, including sparring to get items from their inventory or consulting to learn their skills. Around 12 NPCs can be invited to your party permanently and have their own questlines that can have impactful decisions on them and characters related to them. You craft 9 tiers of equipment and create pills with permanent stat upgrades if you want to farm resources. By the time your character's power level is ""Invincible"" you can probably beat the game easily, but you can go beyond to Supreme and then to Unrivalled and completely destroy everything the game throws at you by the end if you want to take your time powering up.

Few points of critcism:
 - Menus really could stand to be improved. Opening your inventory shouldn't take you to a page of your stats that you have to tab over repeatedly to get to your actual inventory. There isn't really a reason to stop and read the description of your stats more than once, so having to scroll past them with a controller every time you open your inventory to get to your items is tedious. You can tab over with the triggers, but it still takes multiple tabs to get to the items, and using items sends you back out of the item pane so that you have to go back into it as well. You should either start in your inventory, or Characters/Stats should be a separate menu.
- Forging could be a cleaned a bit. I've seen a lot of comments about just using cheat engine to craft equipment, and while you can buy coal cheaply and disassemble gear to get most items back out of it to grind the exp you need, gemstones are a bit ridiculous to get. You need a lot of emeralds/amethysts for the highest tier gear, but the only way to get them is from very low odds in lootbox-style jade ore which is just a pain.
- The story has some points that feel pretty rushed. Decisions or assumptions are made very quickly and things escalate way too easily. In particular, the ending is just bad. More specifically (endgame story spoilers) [spoiler] the main character has done so much good and helped everyone the entire game with no reason for anyone to doubt him in the slightest, but the moment someone says he killed Qinqxu, everyone in the world immediately believes it without evidence and turns on him. This is pretty ridiculous. While Mowen is making the claim, the fact that he was missing for a while then magically appeared at the scene of the crime to make an accusation isn't grounds for everyone to believe it instantly. Then there's the fact that this starts a 180 degree personality change in Mowen for practically no reason. Your family being murdered is a good motivator, sure. But not when you never met them. He gets told a bunch of people he never met were killed by one man with ~8 who were complacent and he immediately decides he's willing to kill hundreds of unrelated people for revenge? This just doesn't make any sense at all and seems to be manufactured drama for the sake of making the ending more ""exciting"". [/spoiler] I think the writing could use the most improvement for future games, but the amount of quests throughout the world and the way some interconnect is a strong start.",1696787510,1696787510,True,129,1,0.924361765384674072,14,True,False,False

故事剧情相当丰富，非常多的支线可以做，而且比较少单一重复性的支线，大多数的支线都有自己独立的故事，能把里面人物的性格刻画出来，而且每张地图的诚意也是相当不错，不敢说媲美AAA大作，但是也是属于小而精致类型。

里面的切磋系统也是相当有趣，与其说是切磋不如说是合法打劫，而且没有惩罚，只要你有势力，连方丈都能打~

整个故事线都相当完整，甚至有几个支线任务堪称大型支线也不为过，有些有趣的人物也需要通过一定的努力才能招收到，唯一比较不好的地方就是有些人物真的是太后期才能招收了，变到没有什么享受到就感觉接近完结了。

There is loads of content as I am still around 30 hours in and not done with the main story, sidequests, companion quests, etc. My only gripes are mostly down to quality of life issues, the companion guide, and the lack of a ng+. Besides that, this is an enjoyable game.

Edit Postgame Review: 
I really do like this game. It scratches that itch for a wuxia rpg in that way I can't really fully describe. Cultivating from a nobody to one of the strongest felt satisfying and you can really feel how much Yi progresses throughout the story. At the same time, a good chunk of my gripes was resolved in the recent patch but new ones have come up upon finishing this game.

For one, there is a distinct lack of postgame credits/story. We learn nothing about the companions we travel with and fought alongside with. Some characters like Ye Fei feel uncomplete. He has so much potential but has no companion quest, he does give cool insights here and there however so that's a plus. It just feels weird to not see what happened to everyone we came across during our travels, what happens to the lady we help delay her sickness?, what happens to the Xuanhuo cult after everything?, there is so much I want to know yet there is so little that is given. Lastly, this isn't really much of a big deal, but please add an actual map so we know where we need to be.

Overall, this is one of the best wuxia rpgs released this year and I would gladly recommend it to someone wanting to play one. Seeing how the developers put so much care into player feedback has me look forward to see what they will implement in the future. If there is to be a sequel, I hope the devs tackle it with the same degree of polish and more for that game.",1695756415,1696757403,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

Never having played a, 'Wuxia,' styled RPG before, my initial impression of the game was one of confusion and a degree of frustration initially. I was so accustomed to games where you're grinding levels and content is gated by level, that this was a completely different experience. Once I'd grown accustomed to how Wandering Sword's power progression works, however, all that frustration gave way to enjoyment.

The game can be as easy or difficult as the player decides, and as we live in an age where games have to be challenging to be considered good, this was a pleasant change of pace. One can dump all of their Meridians into Conception, then Penetrating, then Yeng or Girdle, and become an unstoppable God. Or, you could not do that and spread the points around and strategize your fights more intricately. Being able to learn all the weapon skills also provided a layer of challenge. While Sword and Fist are quite powerful, other weapons require more thought and positioning in how they're used to best effect.

The story follows the travels of a Xiake (chivalrous martial artist) named Yuwen Yi, a spirited young man whom is no stranger to suffering or loss. Yuwen Yi is a perfect protagonist. To clarify what I mean, he is kind, polite, thoughtful, just, fair, and humble. In personality, he exemplifies all the traits of the ideal Xiake. Beyond that, however, he is intelligent, wise, and talented. These traits combined earn him the respect and admiration of many of the people he encounters, whether they be great or small. While normally this sort of main character would feel bland and boring, for the story Wandering Sword provides, it works remarkably well. Yuwen Yi's fundamental beliefs, his commitment to justice, puts him at odds with others more often than not, and I don't just mean our two-dimensional antagonists from Villain Valley, but other righteous and respected men and women as well. The very definition of, 'justice,' as well as, 'good and evil,' are something defined quite differently by different individuals.

The narrative itself follows a winding trail of intrigue and shame as the sins of the past manifest in the present through plots for revenge and conquest. Nothing in the story is particularly difficult to predict or deduce, but the way the story is told keeps it immersive and thought-provoking.

The world is large in scope, providing exploration enthusiasts a great deal to sink their teeth into. A system for gathering and crafting further enhances that aspect of exploration, as well as hidden secrets waiting to be found. For example, there is a cliff one might leap from in their exploration, to see what is below, but unless you have over 3,000 HP and 50 Agility, you're only meeting a game over screen!

Wandering Sword does have a few flaws in some regards. The skill required to craft certain items or to gather doesn't always feel rewarding. There aren't enough Meridian points available to unlock all six types of Meridians. Recruiting characters can be tricky or in one case, almost counter-intuitive (I won't post spoilers, but you should check out the Character Recruitment Guide if you don't want to miss anyone). While you can explore well over half of the world map right from the start, plenty more of it is gated behind the main story-line when that doesn't feel like it needs to be the case.

At the end of the day, however, for what few flaws may be there, the game is still fantastic. 10/10, would recommend playing.",1696712444,1696712444,True,10,0,0.597504556179046631,0,True,False,False

While the game is not flawless (there are some translation issues and the combat system could definitely be better), the storytelling is overall decent, and evocative of classic Chinese Wuxia novels. Story is formulaic to a fault, but it works wonderfully if you're familiar with the tropes and conventions. Also loved the little nods and references (albeit thinly veiled).

More polish, especially in the graphics and execution, could make this the Octopath Traveler of the Wuxia world, and a New Game+ or post-game chapter would be a fantastic addition.

The plot is poorly structured in this game. After playing 13+ hours leveling up and getting powerful companions in different parts of the map, I would enter a town and suddenly a plot narrative will run and I will be meeting and talking to characters that I've never met before. I don't know why this is happening. Either I'm getting companions I'm not supposed to yet or that I'm at a higher level than I should be and the plot activates. This made the game unplayable for me as I'm kinda a story guy and I have to replay the whole game just to know what on earth happened. 

Also, after hours of research as a newbie and not getting an answer to cultivation books, here's a quick tip. You can ONLY have 4 cultivation books and each book you level up will directly change your HP and MP. If you remove the book, the benefits will leave until you supplant it with another book and level that up. However, whatever  meridian points you get from leveling up a cultivation book is permanent. So when peeps in reviews and forums say level up as many cultivation books as you can it's because they want the permanent meridian points. Remember, you remove the cultivation book, you remove the increase in HP and MP. 

Because the story is so integral to games such as these, think Octopath Traveller or Fire Emblems, I won't recommend the game until they fix the narrative plot points and stop it from running havoc. Because plot holes just made me scrunch my face like a bull dog and throw tantrums.",1696656391,1696656391,False,11,2,0.552513539791107178,0,True,False,False

-[strike]Battle system could use some work. It's good but gets very tedious for unimportant enemies. There is a real time mode which automates companions and enemies but not yourself so you still have to do the pseudo turn based motions. It would be better if it automated your character too.[/strike]

[u]Developer updated the game and added an auto battle function, which is pretty much what I asked for. So Battle system is now great. [/u]

-Gear management. Gear could say HP 259 but on another line also say HP 320 as an additional stat. The issue is, it makes changing gear very annoying as you have to look at essentially 3 or 4 lines of the same stat, do the math and then figure out which is better. It's doable but it can get annoying if you have a decent amount of gear and a decent amount of companions. A simple green + for the total or something would be far better.

-Auto saving is a bit sporadic and I wish there were more auto save slots.

- Lots of walking, a fast travel option, even if unlock-able would have been nice.

- Difficulty is hard to assess sometimes. Enemies are red, yellow, green or white. That’s fine but there's also titles for spars (such as unrivaled, supreme, invincible, etc) And it would be nice if there was a list of where that is in the hierarchy of power if you hover your mouse over it or something.

I initially tried playing this on the controller but it felt quite clunky so I switched to keyboard and mouse and it was much better.

About the only issues I had personally is that there were a few areas by the end game that you couldn't truly access and you can't get cultivation manuals for every skill so there is a limit to how powerful you can make the allies that travel with you.

-- I wish I'd understood a lot earlier that beating up random strangers ('sparring') occupied a lot of the mechanical space (eg gating important materials and recipes) that would be occupied by grinding random encounters in other games.

-- Unusually for RPGs, I enjoyed the end more than the middle. I had trouble understanding what was going on in some of the midgame quests, but the endgame had nice momentum and answered a lot of mysteries.

-- I ended up with the Evil waifu. Wasn't trying but, sure, I'll allow it.

World and characters are richly detailed, at first almost overwhelming, but eventually one gets used to it, and then it all becomes comprehensive. Combat system is rather simplified, if you go in too weak, you're basically done for, so a lot depends on preparation and side quests, which are plentiful in this open world. The best weapons and armor are always the ones you craft yourself, which is a really nice touch. Love the gathering, crafting and disassembly systems.

Too bad the storyline is totally linear, would have been fun if it were really possible to take up a certain someone's offer to join her group instead of wudang. I honestly feel there could be a lot more interaction and clearer indicators on what could be done with the girls, it feels like there's a lot of missed potential there,  Also despite the variety of recruitable characters, figuring out who they are and how to get them is a chore and most come in too late to be of any interest. For the most part, once I had enough to fill a full battle team (4), I felt there was no reason to recruit any more. 

All told, the game felt very long at first, but then it was suddenly over and now it's finished, it suddenly feels short.

Just some thoughts (I haven't finished the game so forgive if some of these are in the game)
- having the Sect you join be separate from the main story then having a separate story for each sect to encourage replay ability
- having the cultivation play more of a interactive part like a 'cultivation meter' or someway to see the cultivation level so that you can have breakthroughs, also it would be nice so if you eat pills or rare 1000 year old roots you can see the improvement as opposed to a +20 max hp, So players can also do like fire and ice combinations and get increased value from their pills and other combos
- some more interactivity with party members, It feels like they only talk during their sidequests
-a little bit more variance in how techniques perform for instance a dancing sword technique should move your character and do slashes in a difference pattern compared to a normal slash, or a polearm should be able to push enemies.

Really solid game, especially for a first game from the studio. 

The gameplay loop is very fun, fight, gain exp, level up skills and stats, repeat. The story is solid and engaging, with plot points hinted at early in the story slowly taking shape and unravelling. The side characters are well developed and you grow to care for them, even those with relatively little interaction time. The translation to English is good with minimal grammatical errors. 

The studio has a really good blueprint with this game and I hope they keep building on it.

That said I have some things that I would like them to work on and improve in future games.

The main character felt bland. They're the typical noble/righteous MC. However, the game lays breadcrumbs for their past that isn't explored. How did the uncle know martial arts? What happened to the MC's parents? Who were they? I would have especially liked to know who the MC's father was. 

The ending comes too abruptly. We defeat the final boss, have a brief epilogue and then the game is over. I would have liked to ability to continue exploring the world and continue with sidequests. I never did catch that golden carp. 

I would have liked more player agency and ability to make more choices. The story is linear and it works well. However, I would have liked more interactions with the companions and side characters outside of the main story. Especially after the main story. Xiatong, Ouyang Xue, Yao Ji, Moqi, Mowen, the sect leaders, etc. All of them are well written characters that I would have liked to engage with more. The world is rich and expansive and it's a shame to leave it so soon. The ending left me wanting more. There are so many companion characters that I didn't get to meet. There are a total of 14 companions outside of the main quest and I got to meet 4 of them throughout my playthrough. 

In conclusion, the game's really fun, had me engaged the whole way through and I'm looking forward to what the studio does next.",1696454158,1696454305,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Updated: I had somewhat mentioned this vaguely but the way the devs are clearly listening to negative feedback too and have within short turnaround added a number of QoL features alongside expected bug fixes (though the game already has run very well for me and *smoothly* too), is impressing me greatly. 2x speed and adding checks for combat type before combat were great additions based on feedback given.

The game uses a interesting combat system, where you have 6 categories of moves ( 4 tied to your weapon, 2 are universal) which you can slot 4 moves into each category. that sounds like a lot of moves, but the system makes it work, some skills provide passive buffs, and all weapon skills provide damage bonus to that weapon even if you don't use them. meaning its always fun to find new skills.
I found the game story enjoyable, its somewhat a political drama. Trough I will say the final part was a let down.
As is your party members part of the story, you can split them into two parts, story party members that jump in and out of your party trough the story and have meaningful interactions. And optional party members who are completley silent unless you are doing their companion quest (okay technically they might get like 1-2 scenes where they comment on something) , they don't even get a ending!
The world itself is large, vibrant and changing with the story, which is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because you never know if there is a new quest in a little village. A curse as travel from one side of the map to the other takes 5 minutes, and the game has no fast travel mechanics!

All in all
+ interesting combat system
+ enjoyable story for story-characters
+ interesting political drama
- Optional characters are your mainstay party members, and they are silent and do not have endings.
- a large world that lacks fast travel, and travel time is significant.

I've lost my patience for the grind of many JRPGs with age, so I got Wandering Sword half expecting to give up on it after the first 90 minutes. However, the game's charming story and presentation quickly grabbed me, and for the most part, grinding is more or less absent (or rather, heavily curtailed) from the game.

Story-wise, it's a classic ""wuxia""-affair. If you don't know what the means, it's essentially a genre of Chinese Martial Arts fiction - big examples in the west would be stuff like the excellent 2002 film [b]Hero[/b] or [b]Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon[/b]. Tarantino's Kill Bill 2 also draws on some classic wuxia tropes. Think Shaolin monks, Taoist Sects, Secretive Cults and many, many mythical martial arts techniques, the secrets of which are guarded jealously. [i]Your Grey Pine Sword technique is no mach for my Wudang Saberplay[/i].

The plot itself is a fairly straightforward affair with a pleasantly earnest protagonist. Lots of different characters and factions are introduced with a variety of allegiances and philosophies, but there's never a big expectation on the reader to remember it all or keep track of who's who. The game occasionally will offer the player choices in quest resolution, but often the choices are false choices, leading to the same consequences in the end, or have a very limited effect on the outcome in the end. 

Mostly the plot is a vehicle for dramatic confrontation between mostly straightforwardly heroic, villainous, barbaric and noble characters, and that works well for a game like this. The wuxia genre works great for this kind of game, as it provides a tailor-made setting for the prime JRPG mechanic - the accumulation of power.

The localisation is generally good. It will occasionally be slightly wonky, but in a charming way that always remains comprehensible.

As for the mechanics, the most interesting component is how it puts a hard cap on grind. Winning fights rewards Martial Points, which are then used to level up techniques. Techniques come in a number of different types. Enhancing weapon techniques (normal, special and mighty) will make those techniques more efficient in combat, but will also enhance your general mastery of the weapon type the technique is for. Cultivation techniques are mostly self-buffing skills, but enhancing them also awards Meridian Points, which are used to ""unblock meridians"" - the game's primary way of increasing the characters base stats.

At the beginning of the game, martial points are scarce, and are reserved for your character's most important skills. However, as the game goes on, you'll start building a surplus of martial points, and will need to seek out new techniques on which to spend them. Even sidegrades or techniques which are worse than your current ones have interest, since leveling them will increase your weapon mastery or give you meridian points. Especially cultivation techniques are of interest, since meridian points are extremely useful in making your character stronger.

Techniques can be learned from manuals, which are obtained from various quests and battles throughout the game. These are useful, because they can be reused for companion characters as well. For the main character, techniques are also frequently learned through story quests and finally can be obtained through ""consulting"". Consulting is a mechanic whereby some NPCs will teach you their techniques if you raise their affinity high enough. For a few companion and story NPCs, affinity is raised through quests, but for the vast majority, it's all about giving them the right sorts of gifts.

The first effect of this, is that it ties progression to exploration. In order to become more powerful, the best thing to do is go out and find techniques. If you actively seek out techniques for your main character, a little bit of grind is necessary to keep up with the martial points to level them, but quite limited in scope.

The other effect of the consulting system is that it really works excellently with the narrative. If you want to get a little hoity toity, you could say it provides ludonarrative coherence. Essentially, it very strongly invokes the feeling of being a wandering martial artist, travelling the world and picking up techniques to further your martial arts from anyone who will teach you.

For weaknesses, the game has a few. The game is a bit too heavy on fetch quests. The crafting systems also seem a little underdeveloped - gathering the resources to actually level crafting is slow and arduous and for some of them, especially cooking and alchemy, it seems very hard to level without making a concerted effort to grind for them. Lastly, the companion quests could really do with some fleshing out. A lot of them seem to be building up to an interesting conclusion, but then the climax never show up.

All in all, I really recommend this game. It's a good time and continued support from the devs has been really good so far.",1696380813,1696380813,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are a lot of mechanics in this game, but those mechanics are not used in any way.
All that is needed is a high attack stat, usually from a strong allied NPCs because raising yours is too long and boring.
I dont recommend you buy, unless you are one of those gamers who are trying to dupe their boredom in a ""good time-filler/ time-waster"" (and even then, there are less expensive options out there).

---
Combat is boring. The ""tactical"" fights are blend. Buff or debuff are useless. Moves with different zones of attacks are useless. Your weapon specialty doesnt matter. All that matters is your damage. You either stomp them or get stomped. 
Progression is boring. If you get stomped, you need more exp, so you grind boring fights to ""improve"", to finally be able to stomp the enemy that 3-shot you. And you have those kind of encounters quite early: the first secondary quest outside the first village you were in is already way over you level (killing boars is that demanding...).
Exploring is punishing. There is no map, no fast-travel. If you venture in a forest a bit too far from were you start, you get killed by scorpions. If you manage to kill them, you get minimum rewards, because, let s face it, it s just scorpions.
The story is on rail. You dont decide much. You usually encounter NPCs way stronger than you, that you NEED to ally with because they kill the monsters, not you. You just here to witness the fight, and the story unfolds.
Gathering, forging, making relationships and even distributing your Qi (like a skill tree mechanic) doesnt matter. There is a gift mechanic to raise intimacy with NPC for example. When you finally meet someone with loot or techniques that may interest you, the game prevents you from gifting because he or she is ""stronger than you"". You can only gift to people weaker than you. Which is useless. So gifting exist but the mechanics is useless.

To be honest, I would be okay being a drone witnessing an interesting story, but the main story needs grinding just to move it forward. And killing endless boars or snakes or bandits in autobattle is not fun to me.

--- Suggestions for the devs (who asked for specifics, but I dont know where else to put it)
TACTICAL :
- add shapes and environment to combat grids (ex. water, bridges, patch of trees, rocks, different hazard with different effects like fog, rain, miasma, etc.) // avoid bareland generic grids
- balance weapons so that each style has its merits and drawbacks. For example, fists are only hitting one tile (usually) but swords hit at least 2 tiles, so to balance things fists should be hitting almost twice as hard (or give stacking effects that get the damage close to it). Fist doing about 7% more damage than sword (for the same level of rarity of the technique) is just not enough and makes it a bad choice to ever use.
- common buff/ debuff mechanics are missing. Unless you want to create your own mechanics, you can add stun, invisibility, surprise attack, parry, AoE with lingering effects/ damage/ healing, environment manipulation (like adding impenetrable obstacles or explosive kegs), burn/ poison/ etc can have their own resistances, etc.
- numbers could be explained: 100 atk vs 100 def makes how much dmg in the end? No idea. Basic mechanics are not explained, hence it seems optimal to skip the details and get as much atk as possible. So explain the numbers, somewhere.
- fighting 3 underleveled mobs at a time is quite boring and repetitive. You could add a wave system where mobs come in 2 or 3 waves, pushing the players to strategize differently for longer fights. It adds difficulty differently than just giving enemies more dmg or hp. And those longer fights could reward more exp.
- bonus exp could be rewarded for different conditions met at the end of combat (no dmg sustained, overkill, multikill, etc.)
- enemies never try to take advantage of side attacks and back attacks. It could be a thing for them to be able to. Seems dumb of them to just hit what is in front of them.
- being able to access the menu while in combat is a basic feature I wouldnt think I ld ask.

I could go on, and on other things than tactical. But it s hardly the place. Feel free to reach me if you would like more ideas/ specifics.

The game is alright. I really enjoy the tactical squad based gameplay and the fighting style choices. That said, however, player choice really feels like a joke.

Following this, there is apparently the option for romance and yet, throughout the story, you're basically forced to watch as you fall for picture perfect singing princess (I'm talking full on date after meeting, blushing, the whole deal) when there are FAR more compelling and interesting characters. One lady straight up murders folks, another learns to weave dancing into her fighting style. RAD. Not so much for scripted girl.

[h2]Writing:[/h2]
The translation is quite competent. There were a lot of unfamiliar terms for me as a neophyte to wuxia, but everything became clear contextually and I appreciated the verisimilitude.  There are a lot of complex relationships and ideas being conveyed here, but everything was totally comprehensible to me.

The game doesn't hold your hand on the world building and will happily toss a lot of names, places, and factions at you which I subjectively really enjoyed; it was satisfying to figure out who people were and to recognize things as you finally reach their locations. ""Oh this is what they meant by Beggar sect - it's literally a sect with a lot of actual beggars"" etc 

The story is basically operating on two parallel plots. The main story is about your rise through the martial arts world and features a handful of companions who come and go as your paths cross and diverge.  It's solidly constructed with some twists and turns and reaches a relatively satisfying conclusion.

There's also a large number of sidequests which seem to operate in their own ""sidequest continuity"".  A few of these quests chain into what are almost miniature story arcs unto themselves.  You can permanently recruit several of the side quest characters, and the longest quests are often tied to those recruitments. The sidequest characters will sometimes comment on - or be actually relevant to - other sidequests.  The biggest sidequest mini-arcs were probably my favorite parts of the game.

I ended up pretty attached to the sidequest party; they almost all get enough screen time in their recruitment and/or personal quests to demonstrate interesting characters and they have great designs.  I especially appreciated that they mostly have unique stances and attack animations.

The strangest aspect of the writing is that the main quest and sidequest continuities have almost no overlap.  The main quest does not acknowledge the sidequest companions at all and only very rarely recognizes the outcomes of any of those quests which feels weird in both directions.

[h2]Combat:[/h2]
The core combat is grid based with characters getting turns more frequently based on their stats. Almost every random encounter is avoidable by simply dodging the enemies as you run around.  You can usually deploy up to five characters, though you'll sometimes have more or less depending on the circumstances.  Each character specializes in one of five weapon types (your main character can use any of them) which governs the moves they can learn.

I found the system to be quite enjoyable for the first 30-50% of the game when I was still relatively weak. Probably my favorite fight was a tense minutes long slug fest against an optional miniboss that ended with most of my party unconscious.  Unfortunately the difficulty hits an inflection point and slopes downward dramatically as you proceed; if you have a moderate understanding of the system you won't really be challenged by the halfway point. I think the final boss hit me once.

In fairness this is a game about getting stronger, so reaching unrivaled heights of strength is part of the fun - I just wish the early tension had lasted longer.

Note that the combat offers two modes, but real time is primarily an auto battle mode. It's nice for when you're too strong for the combat to matter. They even patched in a 2X speed mode :)

[h2]Presentation:[/h2]
It's gorgeous, look at the screenshots.  I subjectively love the character art and the combat animations have a lot of pretty effects and satisfying sounds (I will never get sick of dropping Thunderbolt Swordplay on people).  Part of the appeal might just be that ""Fantasy China"" is a relatively novel setting for me (Jade Empire is my only other experience).

--------

Finished the game at 73h mark. I grinded all cultivation martial arts, forged all the best equipment for the MC and maxed out all pills he can take. I got the almost perfect ending (didn't max out friendship with one key character).

I can say without a shred of doubt that this is by far the best wuxia game I have played (Amazing Cultivation Simulator holds the best Xianxia though :)). While there are some aspects to be desired, which I will get in detail later, it does use most of the mainstream Jianghu setting to a great effect, and the main story is very good with regards to that. If you progress the MC the right way, you will feel you are getting stronger and stronger, to the point where when I got to the end game I felt I was indeed the best in the world.

However there are some things that either are not so great or that break immersion quite a bit:

- As I mentioned, I went out of my way to master every single cultivation method out there, which involves beating all sect leaders and maxing out my main character as much as possible. This means I literally never lost a battle, even the ones I was scripted to lose, and here is my grievance. I was strong to the point that not a single boss posed a threat, and I managed to beat all unbeatable fights, but due to it being a scripted lose it always felt... cheap. Granted, winning some of these battles early on would affect some plot points, but instead of having my character sit there almost dying after a battle when I literally one-shot the boss felt quite bad. Maybe we should have a scripted situation even when I won, and that could be something that changed the tone of the characters in later parts of the game.

- Cultivation in the game didn't feel so great. I understand the reason they did things this way, but its quite odd, if you are familiar with the setting and cultivation in general, to have your character progress by learning clashing cultivation methods (i.e. learning Shaolin and Wutian cultivation methods makes no sense lol). Perhaps it would be better to have a system where we chose a path and we progressed through it. Sure, it could be a bit more limiting, but still.

- Perhaps this is something that is exclusive to manhuas/manhwas and webnovels, but usually the Jianghu setting has 9 Great Sects + Beggar's Union, 5 Noble Families as the ""Orthodox"" or ""Martial"" Union, Green Forest and a bunch of other bandit sects as the Unorthodox Union and the Demonic Cult as a 3rd great threat. I understand condensing things for the sake of brevity or for lower complexity of the story, but missed some of these elements in the story. Sects like Mount Hua, Emei and Kunlun and families like the Namgung, Tang and Peng are staples.

- The battle system is quite good, but I feel we could have benefited from something more similar to how Final Fantasy Tactics does battle maps. The grid system is fine, but specially when there were 10+ characters in a battle it felt too crowded.

- Maybe we could have had some more hidden masters to teach the main character. Sure, he gets lots of teaching from main sect leaders through the story, but perhaps we could have hidden masters that were optional through the world in order to learn truly OP skills. These could be optional bosses that you would have to go out of your way to beat, but it would add some challenge when you are one-shooting everything.

All in all these are minor gripes, and as I said, this is by far the best Wuxia game out there right now. I was hyped when I first heard of it, and the hype was real. I hope we have a Wandering Sword 2 with better elements and a fleshed out world, perhaps with more sects and martial arts in the future.

The story will not be anything goundbreaking to those familiar with the Wuxia genre, but it is a classic story well told.
Not a lot of branching choices to explore beyond just not doing certain things (or merely failing), but at 50 hours for a relatively completionist playthrough there is a lot to do and see still, and in my opinion the story would not benefit from deviating from its classic martial arts tale formula.
Companions exist and will occasionally chime in, though more content involving the non mandatory party members would be the one thing I would like to see improved on the story front.

The combat is fun and engaging, though can feel repetetive if you reach a point where you do not find any better techniques for a long while. This is thankfully very rare.
Thankfully speed up, real time and auto battle settings exist for this scenario when it does come up.
My one recommendation to the developers would be to explore the possibility space of the system a bit more.
The ability to influence enemy positions is present but in my opinion underutilized.
Likewise having techniques with actual drawbacks to the user might be interesting.

Graphically this game is some of the most gorgous pixel art I have ever seen. No need to elaborate here, just look at the screenshots.

Soundwise, not only does the music hit the tone of each scene very well, the sound design of the techniques has that hard to describe quality that makes every hit feel satisfying.

- Super fun. 
- Very intricate details in the questing. I do virtually all side quests and I'm surprised with the amount of detail that's put into them. The writing is great!
- Deep combat/skill system. There are many ways to build your character and a TON of skills you can learn.
- Makes you feel like you're in the middle of a murim webtoon. 
- Developer adding AWESOME features every week. The updates are actually useful and have only been enhancing the game for me. Adding auto-battle recently changed everything.
- I dig the music. A lot!
- The game is MASSIVE. It's deceptively so.

Neutral:

- No fast travel system. It would be nice to have.
- Gift giving and sparring can get old after 30+ hours when it takes 6 spars to get one specific item. However, auto-battle was just added so this isn't an issue at all anymore.
- The names. My word - I can't remember all of these people.  There are SO many characters with loooooong names. It's Chinese based so it's OK with me. 
- Hard to remember which vendors had which items you'll want for crafting. I know it's lazy for me to not make personal notes of it. However, adding a vendor or 2 in the later areas that sell everything would be nice.

Negatives:

- I had no major gripes with this game.  I think the last big story battle that opened up the ending fight felt a little off. And the ending just kind of putters out. 

It was like - major battle - last area opens up - go there and end game - or explore more for hours to find characters, items, recipes, that you won't use. 

Not a big deal - balancing all of this and the first place would be a massive endeavor. Just a little disappointing. 


Summary: This game is fun AF. I had a blast trying to become all powerful imagining myself in this Wuxia world. Didn't see any woke nonsense I enjoyed playing this more than Baldur's Gate 3.

TL:DR - Do you enjoy turn based, classic style JRPGS? Have you enjoyed any Murim webtoons? Do you like Kung Fu? If yes, buy this game. Period.

My only criticism is that I wish the game had more of an endless sandbox feature, like Battle Brothers, where we could continue our wuxia journey and face powerful foes. As it stands, the game gives you a great feeling of getting powerful, but ends a bit too soon once you get that power.

The combat is fun, and the weapons feel different. There are a lot of special moves with different types of synergy to reach for. I fought with fists and there were probably 20 different attacks to choose from in the 4 slots. Towards the end it might start to feel repetitive, but at that point you will have figured out enough build strength that you can auto the mob battles, and still enjoy the boss fights. 

The characters are for the most part well developed, but you will get a couple companions that feel like filler. Non-companion NPCs also get a lot of development through the side quests. There are some fetch quests, but you get a good number of actually interesting side story quests too. 

The devs have been pretty responsive, and fast with getting QOL and fixes in there. I have had some annoyances, which were addressed, but no bugs at all. If you did run into something, I would imagine it would be with the quest system. It does not hold your hand even a little bit, and translation issues can make it unclear at times if you are going to miss a quest. However, in the more important spots they give you a message letting you know that your response is important, and you can respond appropriately. 

The world, aside from probably wandering the overworld, was gorgeous. The animations were really good at all times. You can see that from the screenshots, but nothing at all was phoned in. Moments that are meant to feel epic, feel epic. Moments meant to feel intimate, usually achieve it. 

The game might be a touch too long, and probably I would have cut out one of the middle zones and combined some of the story elsewhere. You never end up getting to the end of the crafting tree, and you don't need to either. You have access to any weapon you want to specialize in, but you will not be able to swap it really unless you do it pretty much immediately. I wouldn't recommend using hidden weapon because its the least developed, though its still powerful.

Leveling up:
This is a Wuxia game that is unlikely like any other rph game where you beat up monster and level up. ex. Final Fantasy games, etc. The level-up system in this game is very interesting and you need to learn a bit before you get the details. The level up can still be improve and I super interesting how the dev will take this new concept further. I have a feelings that it is quite not there yet, but it still fun to see what your character can do.

Game story:
So far I love. A lot of Wuxia's theme and story concept. Romance, tragic, and revenge style. The best part of this game is how the talking dialogues is short and simple. Other Wuxia games that I have play in the past have super long cut scene and long talking point to the point where I just want to skip everything.

Combat:
The combat is okay. Player really need to pay attention to what and where you are attacking from. Those front, side and back attack do really make a huge different.  Recently, I also like how the dev listen to the fans and update the game by adding auto battle and double speed the combat game. kudo to them for listen.

Forage/smiting/tailor:
Gathering items to me feel like a tedious choices, but it does reward the player. I like how making weapons and armor add a lot of extra stats boost to your character. 

Dev
The dev group listen to their fans and gave us what we want. This is a group dev that I will be supporting in the future. I hope they will make great games. 

Overall, it is a great game. I bought this game, but Octopath and other games like this one are too expensive. 9/10

This is a very good game and has many qualities to praise

one of them is the gameplay which is very good and fun

There are also many martial arts options that can be learned, but in my opinion you should be able to learn all martial arts, including those used by boss characters (which are locked).
I am also curious about Tianji Palace and its leader
I hope there is an option to learn martial arts from Fulongzhi and Tianji Venerable (Evil Arts)

The RPG elements are quite good, but the option to join several factions could be improved and the choices we make should have more consequences
(I see there are only a few choices that have consequences)

That's why I recommend the game Fallout New Vegas and I hope the RPG system can be applied to the sequel to this game (I Hope you guys make this kind of game again)

While my playtime may seem low due to playing it offline on occasions, I clocked in a total about 35+ hours for a full playthrough. 

The combat.
It's alright. It's nothing amazing, but it works well enough. It was a bit slow though during my playthrough, having to do the combat against fodders eats away at the time. But they added an auto battle and a 2x speed, so I don't think it'll be much of a problem anymore.

The story.
In all honesty, it was pretty generic. But I prefer generic but done well than a story that tries to be too complex but fail to be interesting. And Wandering Sword is interesting. Although the  story is generic, there's enough intrigue and twists and turns to keep me engaged. The big side quests are also full of interesting and colorful characters and often ties into the main plot, so it doesn't feel like you're putting the main story to the side to go adventuring somewhere else.

The ending.
While I very much enjoyed the story. The ending was very weak. It's anti-climactic and very sudden. It also has a major lack of closure on a lot of things. However, I enjoyed the journey, so I'm not gonna kick it too hard for the lackluster destination.

How RP is this G?
It's important to note that this is a story about A character NOT YOUR character. While you can make some choices during certain scenes, the story is more or less fixed, and so is the romance. It's an RPG that has a story to tell, and you have to stick with it. It's not something I mind, but I've seen that it's a problem to some people, so it's worth mentioning",1695498818,1696032479,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Build Path/customization: If you really wanna feel like the main character and be strong you almost always have to take the same build path. Maybe something like new game plus? also more martial skills to collect, sword just feels so jerked off, 4/10 

Story: I did love the story. 8/10 wish there were more endings but nothing major.

Companions: Some of the companions lacked luster in story progression. They just kinda ended + wish there were some way to give them more skills. Maybe you can create one consulting book or something for one character each so they can have more skills and more depth.

Gameplay: Felt really good, enjoyed it as I stated the skills need a little bit more variety, kinda wanted to go a full frost build but failed to really achived it.

Crafting: loved the crafting, I enjoy games which give you a reason to craft and makes the items viable.

Grid based turn based tactical combat reminiscent of Radiant Historia, a killer soundtrack, and a likable cast of characters. The translation is decent, but not great. It feels like an SNES era Squaresoft translation. There are stiff parts but you won't have any trouble following what's going on or what the vibe of the scene is supposed to be.

To delve into the combat system in greater detail, there are five weapon types that the protagonist can use. Swords, which lean towards smaller AoE patterns and higher base damage. Sabers, which have large AoE patterns and lower base damage. Polearms, which tend to have large AoE patterns and more defensively oriented skills. Fists, which have the highest base damage but are single target only on the majority of their moves. Hidden Weapons, which have long range and trend towards having debuffs on their attacks. It's a good system all in all, the martial arts skills are varied and fun to use and there is real variety in builds available. However, this system is not without its downsides.

The chief flaw of the system as I see it is that A) Availability of polearms and hidden weapon skills in the early game is very limited, so they can feel like a 'wrong' choice for the protagonist and B) Polearm's emphasis on being defensive and tanky does not feel particularly useful. The game simply isn't hard enough to feel like you need that level of durability. Still, I had fun with the polearm and hidden weapon party members I used. It is not a crippling flaw by any means, but polearms did feel noticeably weaker than other options.

The story was quite good and managed some real pathos. The sins of the elders falling upon the younger generation, all that tragic wuxia stuff is here on offer with some good twists and turns on the journey. Several times I was certain the game was going to play a plot development relatively straight and predictable and found a curveball I didn't anticipate. The primary two female leads are both interesting figures in their own right, though the Girl in Red is definitely the more active of the two.

Nothing that changes the feel of the game, just some highly requested QoL changes that they received from numerous sources. These changes were made without being heavy handed in the implementation and I can say the game is honestly better for them. The changes include (but are not limited to) ways to address the turn-based/real-time combat before a boss fight, combat speed, and auto battle. All of these are great additions and make the combat a lot of fun and help with the some of the heavy grind feeling. These changes and the dev response alone should net an already fun game many positive reviews.

The game has been a lot of fun so far and is exactly the sort of game I've been craving since things went south with Tale of Immortal. Beautiful world with lots of people to interact with and an amusing story. Your strength grows in proportion to the amount of effort and training you put in to it, the path of cultivation has no shortcuts and the road to immortality must be taken a step at a time. (grind, but its a game.) If you're just looking for more content to consume you might not have the patience for the game, but I'd recommend it just the same for its looks and just enjoyment.

I love that I can butter up an old man with some tea and Go pieces and then beat the crap out of him until I own all of his things. It makes me want to observe strangers to see what they have, its a great way to get blueprints, pills, and some great weapons.
I enjoy the way they made the special effects of equipped martial arts work, it gives some additional things to look for in martial arts and reasons to level up more than just your specialized weapon. Sometimes its a fist fight and sometimes you want a sword. Hidden weapons have some fun effects and can surprise you and mess you up sometimes.

My biggest problems are with things that happen during combat. You can't pull up the menu in combat, so you have to finish the encounter before you can reload. [strike] This is very annoying if you are say, walking around a forest in real time mode killing spiders and then get into a boss encounter with no ability to switch back to turn based mode. Or when you find that encounter that teaches you how much stronger the enemies around here are. [/strike] (rendered moot by dev changes) I don't mind losing a battle, but I hate having to watch a stompfest I know is a loss. Not in that funny ""oops I pulled the phoenix tail"" way, but more just in a ""wow that turtle was shockingly strong"" I probably should just run more. (this is significantly less meaningful with 2x speed and auto fight)
-The way the camera bounces around in encounters is frustrating but a small thing...ideally I'd want an option to anchor it and an option to pull up my options during combat. But its not that important.
-Not being able to use items in combat is an interesting intentional design choice. I get it, especially if you don't have a system to balance the AI ability to use restoration items. But it can make for some tense battles watching that Qi bar fill hoping you get there first for the final hit, but items could also add some depth and strategy. To me, it still drives home the feeling that in the face of overwhelming strength, strategy is useless. A small stat numbers difference can be overcome with say, faster Qi gathering, but once the number difference hits a certain point you are done. Just like a Wuxia should be. Upgrading cultivation methods and striking points is very important. Just like a Wuxia should be. Combat is important.",1695169143,1696011667,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only gripe I have is the overuse of overpowered allies and fights you cannot win. A fight you cannot win is an ok mechanic to use once, but multiple times gets annoying.  I feel its better just to use cut scenes with a few attacks thrown by both sides and my character losing. This is just my personal preference, so I did not let it effect my view on the game. Same goes for the overpowered allies. There were several times I had my main group just skip their turn and used the ally to kill everything, since my group would have died in 1-2 hits anyways. Cool mechanic to use once, annoying when its used repeatedly.
Those two personal preference gripes aside, everything else has been amazing and the devs have worked quickly and efficiently fixing post launch bugs and adding requested features. I'm definitely keeping them on my radar for other projects they release in the future.

The short version:
Overall - 9/10
Graphics - 10/10
Music - 8/10
Story - 8/10
Gameplay - 9/10

Now the detailed version:

Graphics - Beautiful pixel art with backgrounds to match that served to make a cohesive vision ( I mention this because I played the Final Fantasy 9 remaster recently, and there was a distracting difference between the redone character models and the backgrounds.) that really fit the theme and feeling of the game.

Music - Overall very well done and again fit the mood and feeling most of the time.  The battle tune in particular gets stuck in my head which is generally a good sign.  Some of the time though I felt it was a bit too soft and melancholy in places.

Story - Very well told both in the main story and several of the side arcs, particularly for the recruitable characters. There were some tropes, but that's not always a bad thing.  There were a few minor translation stumbles that were distracting but nothing terrible, and they have been patching some of that so those may have been fixed by now.

Gameplay - Ticked all the RPG boxes.  Crafted gear that was worthwhile but not absolutely necessary, hidden chests, secrets scenes, plenty of sidequests.  Most of all though the combat was fun.  It required strategy but didn't feel cumbersome or obnoxious in difficulty, nor too easy.  And, being able to customize the build of not only your main character, but the rest of your party was a welcome touch.

Overall - This game gave me major Suikoden vibes and I truly enjoyed my time with it.  In fact I have already decided my next weapon choice when I decide on another playthrough.  I didn't give it a 10/10 because I think it's too rare for a game to truly be a 10/10 and there were a few things (very minor translation hiccups, controller was a little wonky) that kept it from that.  If you enjoy tactical RPGs with that classic RPG feel, play it. (If you are wondering what games I do find 10/10 for reference since everyone has their own tastes... Suikoden 2, Tales of Arise, and Yakuza: Like a Dragon come to mind.)

So I've completed the game after putting 50hrs into it. Some of my favorite RPGs are Chrono Trigger and Xenogears and I can confidently say this game is more enjoyable than my experiences with those two games. Wandering Sword is a love letter to RPG fans and the best introduction to the Wuxia world for the western audience. I am so glad to have randomly purchased this game. This is proof that AAA games don't know how to give us something we didn't know we wanted so badly. I can't express how much joy I've had playing this game. I'm almost 40 now with two kids and the joy of playing RPGs have pretty much gone away. This game brought back all the joy and wonder from my childhood. Thank you so much to the developers and the publisher who brought this game to us. I'm definitely a fan moving forward! 

The ultimate Chinese themed RPG

This game is so unique. If you are Chinese and you grew up with Wuxia stuff in your childhood, this will give you satisfaction many games will not give you.

A lot of my early concerns are improved in recent patches, especially speeding up the combat which makes the playing experience a lot smoother. The game still shares some of the shortcomings of MMO like mechanics, but overall I think it's a fun adventure game that will mostly likely be improved with future support.

I will leave the original review below for the record.

--

I actually kind of like this game, but it just have too many problems in its design for me to wholeheartedly recommend it. It is one of the better wuxia game in my opinion, but it still has many frustrating elements that not everyone would enjoy.

Pros:
- Art is beautiful, similar to Octotraveller.
- Playing the game does make you feel like you are living in one of the classic wuxia novel.
- Story is intriguing, it borrowed plots from classic wuxia novels and mixed them into something of their own. Characters are pretty fleshed out. Some companions get more love than others but they are generally good.

Cons:
- You can't access the menu while in battle, no loading a previous save or even just exiting the game through the menu. You also can't really tell how strong the enemy is in the wild. If you find yourself in a battle you can't win, you have to either spend a few minutes to attempt to flee the battle or get yourself killed. 
- Battle is slow if you do turn-based. Real-time battle is faster but you will get destroyed by stronger AIs. You can't switch between turn-based and real-time during battle, if you need to change, the fastest way is to do it is to close the game, re-open the game, reload then change the settings.
- You can't save the game indoor for some reason.
- No difficulty settings. Enemy AI are also really basic. If you have better stats than the enemies, you will find the fights not challenging at all. Conversely if the enemies have better stats than you, there's not much strategy you can do besides running away grind for more stats.
- Choices in conversation doesn't matter. They do tell you when your choices will have an effect, but most of the time agreeing or disagreeing someone both leads to the same result.
- Grinding is necessary in this game. You will have an easier time if you just follow the predetermined path to use swords and put everything you got into your main character, but a bit of grinding is still needed. If you want to use a different weapon or level up your crafting, a lot more grinding is needed.
- The game plays like a single player MMO:
-- The level and enemy encounter design is awful. The enemies lacks variety and spawns infinitely even if the story tells you otherwise. The turn-base combat is slow and you will lose patience quickly when you have to spend time fighting the same 2 enemies that you can one-shot repetitively. The maps often only have one exit, so when you defeat the boss, you have to go all the way back dodging all the re-spawned enemies.
-- Majority of side quests are often just fetch quests, or asking you to kill something 5 times in a map.
-- The map is a half-baked sandbox. You can go anywhere you want. But  you can't really do anything in a zone that is higher-leveled than you. You can only fight wild animals and collect resources in the wild. If you go to a city far away while your progress in the main quest is too slow, you'll find nothing to do there. Following the main quest is the only way to play this game even though it has an open map.

If you are used to the mechanics in MMO and retro JRPGs, or if you want to get a genuine feel of what wuxia novels are like, you probably going to like this game. But for me this feels like a beautiful game with outdated design choices. Hopefully they can be improved in future patches.",1694823889,1695934592,True,0,0,0.725072324275970459,29,True,False,False

+Wuxia story (lol)
+Combat feels good
+Graphics are nice
+The world map when you are traveling around and exploring to walk to the next place feels ALIVE, with a bunch of other material artist wandering around like you do. Able to go a lot of places if you want to from the (2~3 hour mark) Able to explore a bunch of places, and check out places you will have to go eventually and taking on side quests if you want to. (Can't really complete some of them at the start because you aren't exactly supposed to be there, but you are allowed to give it a try)
+There is a skip dialogue (I didn't really use this unless I died or messed up somewhere and needing to reload a safe file but its a really nice feature to just have)
+Cut scenes are good and fluid
+You can spar with people for items
+Devs are actively working and patching the game to make it better. Listening to advice and implementing stuff.
+The gift system (The more you do it, the more it make sense, plus you get to spar back the gift items anyways.
+Devs finally added in the reset button for meridian. So if you messed up your build you can redo it (Haven't touched it yet but they just added it in (as of 9/28/2023)
+Auto button and 2x battle speed

Middle (personal thing)
+- The love interest (Not much attachment towards the main girl just too little for me to care and not enough time spending together with her. (  But what im getting at is that I wish there was more romance options. And more endings to keep up the flavor the game. With those characters or and more missions with them for a different ending
+- Character recruitment (As in not really liking some of the characters or just don't really use or just dropping some of the characters half way through or not really ever using them for other super minor reasons like party too full or just don't really wanna use them.)
+-story length wise (I feel like they can ADD A LOT more stuff or heck a DLC (I would personally pay full price for it. I NEVER DO THAT and rarely buy DLCs all that much anymore)


Cons
-Meridian map/stats
-Techniques scrolls and selling them (Can't remember the scrolls I sold were at to repurchase them) and realizing it too late that I needed it for other characters to get stronger for their own meridian map leveling (Wish there was like a way to get them back or just a store you can buy them back as a safety net or something. I'm not really sure. Or just a way to NOT SELL them for future new players)
-flooded inventory of useless junk
-Shops/trades/blacksmiths and etc. Feel kinda useless at least from the start of the game from what I know of ( I still feel like this even getting more and more closer to the ending



A lil bit more thoughts. The devs got something really great here. There is fans (like me ofc) Who are honestly starved for more story or content within the game and wanting more endings and other stuff. Maybe my lil small of an idea of wanting them to expand and capitalize on the idea since there is basically extremely niche thing going on with the whole wuxia and martial art scene of JRPG style to go capitalize it when they can. (I know there is wuxia JRPGs on steam but they are honestly not as good as this or just not in english)

All around i recommend the game, especially if they continue making the controller support better.
Ran into a bug where in real time combat i moved at the same time as the opponent and then i could never take my turn again until i died. the bug only happened one time as i selected to move through the enemies path and that was before the optimization update.

Other than that, the game is quite enjoyable. Vertical progression where you can farm gold, materials (to craft) and martial XP (to upgrade skills). Those 3 elements will help you spar with other experts around the world to earn their items and if you befriend them, they will teach you additional techniques.

The game is beautiful, the main story is pretty strait, but you can solve other quests around the world.

You can probably rush the main story in around 50 hours, but theres more stuff to do while you roam around.

You can have temporal companions in your party, other guys that will follow you forever and there's even some branching in some quests.

To ease the farming you can make combats in auto, so it's not a chore to farm stuff.

The problem I found was that you could be farming with battles in ""real-time"" (where your mates move by themselves) and when you face story battles, they all run automatically. A couple of days later, devs added ""this is a story battle, do you want to play in ""normal mode"" or ""real time""?"". Love that feature too.

For a wuxia fan this game is a love letter that delivers everything I wanted (and more), and for those new to the genre, I believe this game showcases some of the best elements this genre has to offer.  All in all, the game has left an impactful and lasting taste that has made me wanting more (sequels? spin offs? stories in the same genre? yes, yes, and yes!).  So let's get to some of the details that stuck out for me.

 -Writing / Language
Many wuxia games are marred by poor and lazy translation and that's usually a very big turn-off immediately, making it close to unplayable since the story doesn't make much sense.  Not only does this game do a good job at delivering the story, but it doesn't shy away at illustrating the true essence and spirit of each scene. (Eg. There is nothing more badass than having a scary villain citing some ominous poetry before entering the scene, or as beautiful as a girl citing poetry while playing the guqin in the sunset etc).  The fact that these typical elements that would belong in a wuxia novel/tv show are in this game, really add immersion to an already amazing plot.  A minor thing I would point out in this department, I noticed sometimes the game would throw out a chinese word liberally without explaining what they mean (like jianghu, xiake, etc.) For western audience not familiar with wuxia, they might get lost in the meaning.  Though this doesn't happen too much, and its only those few words, I'm sure someone would just quickly google it.  Not a big deal here obviously, but some games do have a glossary section, or include word definitions in their loading screen sometimes (just an idea, I'm still giving 10/10 for this category).

-Gameplay
The world in this game is big and expansive, with many places to explore.  Love the diverse areas and environments that even show subtlety in the differences of culture (like how people dress differently in Nanjiang compared to the central plains, or how their names are even different, big plus here).  The grid-fighting system offers enough strategy to keep the game interesting and fun.  The character building system (with meridians to choose from) plus all the variety of skills/styles (cultivation skills, lightweight skills, and weapons skills) to mix and match really allows lots of room for experimentation and even replayability (even grinding was fun for me since I needed to scratch that itch of testing different skill combinations).  I'll give a 10/10 here since the game was addictive enough to make me actually want to grind and collect all the skills (I've clocked 82 hours already and I still want to go back and collect the rest, as well as get the other endings).

-Graphics and Music 
10/10 - Colourful environments with attention to detail to express the culture and the world.  Good character portraits that add more personality to each person in the game.  Music is beautiful, expressive, and very fitting for the genre.

-Other notes
At the time of writing this review (game released for 2 weeks), the game was updated a couple times with bug fixes and added features.  This is a big plus here that shows love and commitment for the game.  If you've made it this far, I hope you give this game a chance and enjoy this amazing wuxia adventure!",1695918197,1695918197,True,3,0,0.537648618221282959,0,True,False,False

#3 is ok. But there really is NO tactics. There is no terrain advantage/disadvantage, no unit placement, and the environment has no impact on the combat.

I also found that #1 and #2 do no mesh too well together. I found myself way stronger than what the game expected me to be. Many frustrating ""fixed"" fights where you lose in the ""story"".

The story is a traditional Wuxia. I find that it's easy to get sword techniques, or Saber or Fist Techniques, a bit harder to get other things. (Hidden Weapon manuals where?)

I really enjoyed exploring the world. It was beautiful. And you do want to explore the world, because if you're like me and missed a couple spots you end up completely missing the ability to recruit some characters which appears to affect your ending.

Crafting matters in this game. Crafted gear is hand-over-fist better than dropped gear. I see a lot of people comparing this game to Octopath Traveller. I only see similarities in the art style. They are two entirely different games.

If you have any interest in cultivation style games or Chinese fantasy, I would definitely pick this game up. It's great.

The English translation is acceptable, but in a game like this I think it needed to be a lot more refined. I'm grateful there's a translation at all, but some of the dialogue seems very nuanced and the poor translation hurts it.

I'm having a hard time deciding whether to give this game a passing grade or a failing one. Sadly it falls short on a lot of points making me edge towards the negative. I hope the developers continue doing what they do. Whether that's DLC or a new project, what's here is a good baseline and I'm looking forward to whatever they planned in the future. Note: Don't click the spoiler tags unless you want to see spoilers.

Combat: The combat is a mixture of a tactics RPG like Tactics Ogre/Disgaea and standard turn based ones. There is a real-time mode which lets AI handle everything. Combat is arguably the weakest point of this game. The vast majority of the time I let the game go into auto play because enemy AI is really awful. Outside of the early game boss battles or forced sequences, there was never a reason for me to go manual mode. In battle you have 4 types of attack skills with 4 slots for each. Then you have a movement ability and a buff ability that also have 4 slots. So in total, you have 24 different skills to play with. The problem is the AI never uses movement abilities and buff abilities. It chooses to attack almost every time, which is a huge flaw because a lot of the buff abilities are very powerful. I don't have too much to say about combat because I let the game auto play 90% of the time. A huge problem with combat is you cannot switch between real time and turn based while in combat. So a lot of the time I'd be doing real time to kill mobs and then run into a boss battle and have to restart in my last save.

Story: The story starts off fine. Yes it's cliche if you're familiar with wuxia, but it has a solid foundation with a nice cast of characters. Around the halfway point of the game when you meet the main love interest is when the game starts progressively getting worse. There are a lot of story points that fell flat if you explore and do all the side quests. For example, a character will act like they met you for the first time even though you did a very lengthy side quest chain for them. This happens very often. The ending was also very abrupt and leads me to believe either a DLC is planned or maybe a sequel. A lot of questions are left unanswered. SPOILERS [spoiler] The writers mention Moli (one of the three ""Mo"" of Wudang Sect), but they are never brought up ever again. The Kama plotline seemed to go nowhere unless I missed something. Yuan plotline went nowhere. A lot of unused cities, regions, and areas. Mention of the Emperor & Empress, but we barely see government officials outside of General Huang and the border towns. [/spoiler]

Recruitable Characters: This is probably the games greatest strength, but also something I wish the developers leaned more heavily on. I specify recruitable because there are many story characters which are strong at the beginning of the game, but they constantly leave and join your party and become so weak in the halfway point of the game that I didn't even bother using them anymore. 

Some of the recruitable characters have lengthy side quests that are based on affection, this is really awesome and something I wish there was more of. I can only think of 4 or 5 characters out of the 9 or 10 that I had unlocked that had lengthy missions. Outside of that you'd get the option to recruit some characters after doing a long side quest chain involving them (a couple are very short). Something I also really liked was that companions commented on side quests or places (rarely). I wish they also chimed in the main story, especially near the end of the game when I thought there was going to be a Mass Effect 2 scenario going on [spoiler]when you battle the various sect leaders[/spoiler], but it ultimately fell flat and made me extremely disappointed. I also wish companions had discussions with other companions. I can only recall 3 separate times when I saw 2 companions having a discussion about something.

I also want to say while the variety of weapon types for characters are even, the spread is not. Far too many sword and saber characters early in the game. Only two hidden weapon characters and three fist characters (two of which are very late game characters) [spoiler] both the hidden weapon and fist characters can die as well [/spoiler]

Side Quests: I found side quests to be the best part of the game. Not the fetch quests/kill X quests, but the major side quests in each chapter were very fleshed out and intriguing. There is a total of three of them [spoiler] Liushan School, Beggar Sect, and Condor School [/spoiler], and all three were excellent and extremely well made. I won't spoil any of them, but they're the highlight of the game for me. Writing for the side quests seemed to be on a whole other level compared to the main story quest.

Exploration: Mostly shallow. The overworld was pointless to include because there is nothing to interact with in the overworld. There are some secrets here and there in maps, but it didn't leave an impression on me. Quite a few areas are unused, especially in the late game areas.

So what is left are 3 amazing side quests and a few fleshed out recruitable characters that converse once in a blue moon after you finish their character quests. Everything else being mediocre or uninteresting.",1695886984,1695886984,False,46,0,0.703311920166015625,0,True,False,False

Let's get the good out of the way
Fun quests,  lots of different attacks allowing varied playstyles, companions with great back stories, tons of little side quests, major sidequests have amazing writing

The bad:
Main character's writing is all over the place during the main story.  The MC you play in sidequests is great but in the main quest, his personality is a total chump.  Much like his ""main"" love interest, both are flat as cardboard and really doesn't give a lot of attachment to either of them.  Consulting is just way overpowered and really should've either been gated or removed altogether because it trivializes most of the game.  The second half of the game felt way too rushed and lots of loose ends.  Also your compatriots who you've went through 90% of the game are completely disregarded in favor of just three people who show up for 5-10% of it.  (Four arguably if you count one spoiler character for about two fights).  Basically the game ""struggles"" with itself in that it has lots of amazing parts but isn't really leaning into them.

Finally, Mowen would've been a much more interesting MC by allowing even arguably two very different end path:

There are recruit-able characters, but several don't have a story arc or side-quest to expand their martial arts or resolve a conflict.  The opening of the game feels wide and has decent pacing in building up tension and difficulty, but after a particular point, things ease up and the story resolves itself too quickly imo.

For me, the conclusion of the story isn't a crucial factor. What I enjoy the most is completing missions and having the freedom to explore the game world, whether it's gathering resources, fishing, or recruiting individuals with unique abilities. I find these activities more engaging, despite the game's emphasis on the story. However, I don't understand the point of the grinding system. It feels like a waste of time once you complete the game and return to the title page.

When it comes to fist martial arts, I believe that the spar is more enjoyable than playing in a party. Playing in a party seems to be all about acquiring materials and martial points, whereas the spar allows you to learn skills, offers clear rewards, and is challenging even if the enemy doesn't attack from behind. Because of this, the spar of fist martial arts is critical in a 1-1 fight.

First, the bad to get it out of the way: translation exists - it's functional but is often transliterated and some things come off as very silly. It's not bad by any stretch, but does lead to some confusion from time to time. It does the job but could have used an actual localization. The game is PACKED with mechanics and doesn't explain them all that well. Not a dealbreaker but can be a little frustrating sometimes. And finally the end game can be a real grind if you're seeking out the top weapons and armor. Apparently they are all dropped by one enemy who can also drop anything else so you're fighting fractional % chances on one item each kill. 

Onto the good: Wandering Sword is a narrative RPG focused on a specific character: Yuwen Yi who undertakes a journey to find a friend. On the way he journeys with companions to gain power and technique to better serve his journey. While it is fundamentally a linear, narrative game, it often presents as an open world/go anywhere/do anything journey. It's not a ""true"" open world game, but the for all the options it gives you, it might as well be. 

One of the mechanics I love is that you can gain reputation with most NPC's then ""Consult"" with them to learn their techniques. Their high-level techniques require a sparring match and then you can learn it on victory. For my playthrough, I bounced around to locations finding people I could fight and beat for this purpose. Since our main character can learn any skill for any weapon, I ended up climbing a ladder that led to the leaders of all the martial arts factions. By the time I was done, Yuwen was godlike and the party members were almost superfluous. It felt incredibly satisfying to get to that point.

Mechanically, combat is grid-based and turn based (with a real time option). Characters move as you'd expect: based on agility and movement radius, modified by various skills you can cultivate through striking meridians (basically spending skill points for permanent buffs). Your party can consist of up to five characters, though this number can shrink and swell based on story beats where specific characters are added or taken from your party. It pays to always be ready for a solo fight.

I mentioned character development, but the real power is in crafting. Once you get ahold of recipes and materials, you can concoct absolutely broken gear that blows anything you can find out of the water. It's not even close. That said, the process of getting everything you need can be super grindy so your mileage may vary. It's not a bad system but fully engaging in it takes time. 

Overall, Wandering Sword is a breath of fresh air that tends to overstay its welcome a bit if you try to do everything. There's a lot of game here and the devs have talked about replayability, though I can't speak to that. If you can tolerate some translation jank and some unfamiliar mechanics, there is an absolute gem of a game here in Wandering Sword which I recommend despite some rough edges.",1695640175,1695733309,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The 2 things i dislike are pretty tame tho. 

1. After I progressed far enough into the Story some side quests stopped being triggered. If a dev reads this, please give a warning that some quests will become unavailable after the big battle before the end.

2. The main characters can choose any weapon they want but it's a lot easier to just go with the sword thanks to all the trinkets dropped in your way. It would be great to offer alternative at those points so that you can also feel strong even if you go with, for example fist weapons.

Highly recommended must play for all Wuxia fans.
8/10 if you are a rpg lover but not accustomed to Wuxia
9/10 if you are a Wuxia fan (this is probably peerless at this point and it has outdone HeLuo!)
  
-this is a great game! 
-one of the best RPG sandbox of the the 'Wuxia' (aka chinese pugilistic/martial arts/kung fu) genre 
-with tons of skills 
-lots of loots

To dive deeper,

Self intro:
-I am a long time Wuxia fan
-being chinese and fairly well versed in Wuxia lore (I read most of JinYong, Gulong, LiangYuSheng, WolongSheng, Wisely etc novels during my younger days) 
-'Jing Yong Qun Xia Zhuang' (JYQXZ) was mindblowing and very memorable game for me during my youth
-I have played a lot of HeLuo's (maker of JYQXZ. Their HeTuLuoShu on steam is a pretty good) game

*I played this in mandarin to get the full flavor so I am unable to comment on the english translation*

Story: 8/10 
Pros: 
-Its a growing up journey of the male character
-has enough drama to encourage players to complete
-has more than enough lore and Wuxia goodness to enhance the experience 
-lots of supporting characters to recruit 
-and they come with good story plots
 
 Cons:
-Nothing really out of the blue
(it is like Aquaman or the Avatar movie, epic & wholesome but nothing out of the blue) 
 
Graphics:
7/10 (If you are into 3D AAA grade)
9/10 (if you like chibi/cutesy tradtional JRPG grade)
-this is of (Square Enicx's) Octopath Traveller grade
-nice 3D + pixelated style with new gen lighting and depth of field
-just love the various scenery like the peach blossom forest

Audio:
7/10
-appropriate and attuned with Wuxia plus a dash of modern beat
-the variety is lacking though (I am not complaining, this is already above expectation for an Indie maker with this price tag)

Gameplay:
8.5/10
-fast and good enough pacing
-it is the whole and fuller package when you compare to games of the same genre
-there are much depth with various skills builds adding buffs and debuffs
-probably just lacks a little innovation on the dated battle system imo 
(IMO: it is about time to evolve with more elements like terrain, height or weather to freshen up the system) 
-while it is far far from being bad (and is actually quite enjoyable)
-the active battle mode is actually very thoughtful and greatly helps with farming! (kudos!) 
-they added the loot element (aka Diablo style loot feast. Although the variety & depth are lacking, it is much welcomed!)
-there're crafting:  Smithing (weapons & armor) and Alchemy (Pills/Medication) 

In conclusion, 
-this is a must play game of Wuxia fans
-that delivered way beyond my expectations 
-worth every single $
Great work inspiring and pushing the Wuxia genre gaming forward!

*I find it quite hilarious on this aspect of the game:
1 of the crucial way to gain items/skills:
-->gift NPCs item(s)--> raise affinity-->Spar with them-->till they are utterly bankrupt (LOL)
What a ruthless JiangHu (pugilistic world).

The plot is engaging, but I practically one-shot the final fight and the ending was very anti-climactic. It's a shame, because the game was very difficult in the early game, but reached the point where you can quickly beat the hardest NPCs before you unlock the final 2 regions and tiered weapons. Although with it's faults, I still felt the game was an enjoyable experience.

There are some things I found that needed to be adjusted.
- Hidden Weapon needs more skill books in the early game. It's by far the least accessible weapon in the first few hours.
- The damage for the Hidden Weapon should also be adjusted. Bloody Eagle Beak + The Six Knacks' passive for some reason results in you hitting 7-10 times + dots, which ends up hitting 10k late game. This also triggers all the meridian passives to give you additional turns right after you have attacked, allowing you to kill everything before they even move and trivialize everything.
- The lack of a map, mount, or fast travel is frustrating
- There is no endgame content and the game is also too grindy for no reason. There's no end-game content to warrant the grind.
- Cooking (by extension Fishing) and Alchemy felt useless because you weren't able to use any items mid-combat.
- The companions could use a bit more banter. It felt nice to see them interact in the side quests, but those were limited and sparse.
- There were also no epilogues for the side characters you have collected along the way in the ending, which made the ending feel more hollow.",1695687581,1695687581,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ The WANDERING of the ""Wandering Sword"" is strongly emphasized, you get little to no hand holding from tutorials and no Ubisoft formula
+ Beautiful 2.5D graphics (Octopath Travellers eg.)
+ Wide ranges of skills that are weapon-based, providing different playstyles to choose from
+ Not EXP/level based, you do quests or battles, get skills points to level your skills with
+ Somewhat deep power progression system
+ Big overworld (which also comes with some cons)
+ Beautiful character portraits
+ Many great sidequests (also comes with some cons)
+ Some sidequests would have actual choices and different outcomes
+ Solid 50hr+ to complete the game
+ Most importantly, devs are listening to feedback and are continuously improving the game
+ Lots of crafting, from weapons, gears to pills to power up your units with
+ Many recruitable companions

Cons:
- Big overworld, but no mount, hence you'll spend lots of time travelling on foot and takes up time
- Lots of fetch quests, Devs should look into more chain sidequests with deeper choices that actually matter
- Main story quest is somewhat ok, not amazing, but not garbage at least
- Endings would need to be more impactful and meaningful, hopefully Devs can learn for the future games from the feedbacks on this
- No endgame content, this is very important since JRPG lives on this factor alone
- Sparring to get items from NPCs can get repetitive real quick, hope Devs can find a better solution for future projects. This system is rather immersion-breaking and grindy, especially towards endgame
- MC (main character) needs a better background story, this can improve immersion tremendously if done right
- Lack of companion bantering: outside of their own companion quests, there is little to no interactions. Some companions actually have no dialogues after joining.
- No romance

Overall, I'm quite happy with the content provided from this $24.99 gem. I hope the devs continue to listen to players' feedbacks and keep going at it.

When you get some of the modifiers that grant something on crit it means per hit and some moves hit a lot of times so you can abuse that. 

Farm on real time mode. Use story companions to grind martial art points for you before completing their quests.

That being said, those two games did help me get a grasp on some of the terminology at play.  As time went on, I found myself invested in Yuwen Yi, the lovable doofus, and his quest to become stronger and do right by others, a quest neatly mirrored by the player always having their eye on that power rating and waiting to see it jump up.

This is a game that in some ways throws you into the deep end.  Outside of the main story, there's an almost Bethesdian level of side quests that can leave you off the beaten path for hours.  There isn't much in the way of signposting - you can absolutely stumble onto lengthy sidequest chains with little more than a character's offhanded comment as to their existence, but they tend to be involved and engaging - sometimes even intersecting with the main questline and expanding on characters who only appeared briefly.

I've just finished my first playthrough, and it was a fun, and at times surprisingly melancholy 35 hours.  I think that if I had some critique, I would have liked for it to have gone even more in depth on its themes of how much more grey exists in than the righteous Wudong Sect's black and white views of evil, but the story itself is well told, our protagonist easy to root for with his simple and earnest nature in a world often full of duplicity.  It goes places!  At the very least, it was nowhere near as straightforward a story as I was expecting.

It's rough in places.  I think there's some sidequest flags that are a little messed up, and here and there it's unclear if clicking on an ability will select it, or make you use it.  But if you like games with big inventories and lots of optimization this could be for you.  If you like martial arts dramas, this absolutely could be for you.

The combat which is amazing reminds me back to the 2D RPG of the good old days. As for the art style its just gorgeous, simple as that.

Cons:
- The inventory is a nightmare 
- Bad UI design and interface
- Stamina system is quite a hassle 
- Basic QoL are just not in the game [ hopefully that gets fix ]
- Cant use items during combat 
- You will miss a lot of content if you are not careful 

The UI is bad and poorly designed, I don't want the description of an item automatically pop up when I'm just scrolling through the inventory or have the description of an ability be so big its a hassle especially during combat. The inventory just pure nightmare, enough said. The stamina system is frustrating when so many activities requires it and the ways to recover it is so few and resource heavy. Just FIX THE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT and more basic QoL in the game. Also add the ability to use items DURING COMBAT like any rpg game because why the hell do you have loads of variety of it if you don't always have access to it. Lastly have a way to better track progression and content, the amount of backtracking and missed content I went through was just bad, if you are not taking notes during conversations with characters which are clues to potential quest, side quest, quest that could affect the ending or for potential love interests then don't be surprised when you get an ending you didn't expected.

Conclusion: 

If you have the time, don't mind hassle of inventory management and willing to takes notes for progression and content as well looking for a martial arts wuxia game then this is for you but if you don't then wait till the game gets improved as most of my grievances can be fixed with updates. The game overall is great from the story to gameplay as well the art direction personally the issues I had were expected for a recent game but hopefully its gets fixed because this game was so fun especially the story.

Pros :
- wuxia setting 
- nice music
- great pixel art

Cons
- janky control both via controller and keyboard
- boring combat, i feel like i am using skills just to make myself hit as many enemies as possible instead of using a skill for its purpose and i think this was the reason it did not click with me. i dread encountering enemies and fighting them as the NPC that i get is usually so overpowered compared to myself, at least for the first few hours of gameplay that i can just spam normal attacks with the given NPC and kill the boss. 
- backtracking after killing the boss and trying to dodge the minons are irritating. 
- inventory feels very messy and cluttered. 

overall i would rate this 6/10 but i still hope that improvements will be made that will make this game a smoother gameplay experience and i look forward to playing it in future.

I'm not a fan of the wuxia genre, but it caught my attention when my friends posted about it, and after actually playing it, it was 60+ hours well spent (25 of which was spent grinding pretty much every duel in the starting area short of the Qingxiao and Yuan Jue I wasn't *allowed* to fight before progressing the main story past the 110 stamina mark).

---{ Graphics }---
☑ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

This is 2.5D in the sense that the environment is actually 3D and has depth, but everything on it is a sprite, not an actual model, but pixel art. Not a common approach to doing things, but extremely immersive - ironically, more so than if they had opted for full resolution rendering because your brain will fill in the gaps. This will be a textbook example in future of how aesthetics is not just fidelity.

---{ Gameplay }---
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

This game must be played in real-time. Turn-based will make you tear your hair out in 14-person fights, but this is the first time I've played a grid-based semi real-time game that blends reflexes and planning together. In addition, because attack animation cooldown is an actual thing for balancing, the game's balance breaks if you don't play it in real-time - people who did so felt the fist was a lot weaker than the ridiculous powerhouse it is in real-time, a certain move you get early becomes overpowered because of its RNG-ability to trigger repeatedly in turn-based (but is actually quite meh in real-time because its animation time makes it such that chain triggering can actually kill you). For people with problems reading mouseover tips, it's the qi regeneration that determines turn delay together with a unique animation speed for each skill. As a general rule, skills with larger AoEs are slower, and skills with longer range are slower. When played as intended, everything flows very well, and large scale battles actually *feel* large scale. Reserve turn-based combat for the players out there who need it as an accessibility option.

One rank deducted for multiple pointless fights that are scripted to end in your loss, which is immersion-breaking when your HP never went below 99%. Scripted losses should be done as full cutscenes without engaging the combat engine at all. Developers if you're reading this, fix this and you'll have much fewer complaints.

---{ Audio }---
☐ Eargasm
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

The music in this game is actually excellent and on visual novel rather than RPG tier, but sound effect work has room for improvement, and some factions have the same track making it slightly more repetitive than it needs to be. I don't recall a soundtrack being available, but I'd actually buy it.

---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☐ Teens
☑ Adults
☑ Grandma

This isn't because of gratuitous violence or sexual content - while there's references to violence in the text, it's firmly in the Teen category for that. This is because firstly, wuxia as a genre has themes of recurring vengeance and powerlessness that echo with people who've held a job for any length of time, and is much harder for anyone in the Teen and below range to form any emotional connection with. Rather than it having the potential of traumatizing kids, the problem is more that kids will likely find the story bland.

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☑ Potato
☐ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

Due to the choice of pixel art, it's really hard to go less than max frames.

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

Alluded to earlier, but real-time grid based combat has some level of skill requirement, and while it's trivial for players with a moderate level of skill to run literal circles around enemies and clear, say, the Murkwood guard encounter immediately after leaving the first village solo, there's plenty of players in the world who don't meet that skill requirement. Players who are either not interested or not capable of the timing necessary to do fights at the up to two-lower ranks allowed by the game may need to grind obscene amounts of time in order to reach the required power level to curbstomp encounters. There is one optional fight at one point after the PC has more or less capped out on available powerups that may drop a limited recipe you cannot get from any other source - players unable to beat it may be permanently locked out of a certain Tier II equipment type, even though the game will continue even if the player loses.

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☑ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

Grind and difficulty are opposed. The more skill you have as a player, the less you have to grind. If you want you can grind every single duel in the game until you've essentially mugged every character dry (like I did, total playtime around 60 hours), or you can just grind those that drop things you can't simply buy with wen from some merchant, but it is quite possible to clear the game without penta-affixed Mythic Tier II gear on all five of your main team unless you absolutely must beat the optional boss. Alchemy grinding at Wudang is easy since it's free but also lame to train in that way - pill making should have a major XP boost.

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☑ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

Story is extremely well written, but also extremely linear. As mentioned, a certain age is needed to identify with the emotional themes, otherwise it may feel flat. The writing for the western desert optional arc took a very noticeable swandive that made it look like it was rushed, but the other optional arcs and the main story were very well done.

In addition, while the translations are overly literal at times, this isn't necessarily a bad thing relative to the bad localization choices some translators make.

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

This is essentially visual novel length with about 30 hours of pure story, and another 30 of grinding, but without the branching goodness of visual novels. The main control you have is what optional quests to engage in, but you have essentially near to no choices at all within the main story, and some choices are false in that they'll lead to the same result, which would make it better if the choice wasn't even given (monkey feeding anyone?).

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

The quality far exceeds its asking price.

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

Moderate immersion break when I entered a city (in the jungle area) from the southeast and ended up entering from the north entrance in the cutscene, that could be easily fixed. Also, sometimes mobs or even the PC get stuck if they attempt to move through the same space at the same time, which makes the stuck character a sitting duck unable to take actions until it dies or the combat ends, whichever is sooner.

For a small developer nobody has heard of, it's surprising to see an end product superior to Octopath by a large margin. This is a legitimate contender for game of the year alongside Baldur's Gate 3, the game that *kind of* released over several years, which is not something anyone would expect from a pixel art RPG.",1695522302,1695522302,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all for any fans of Wuxia or Xianxia, the plot feels exactly like a classic novel of the genre, to the point that if you stripped out the combat and left only the plot and the (many and meaningful) choices, I believe it would still make a compelling Wuxia Visual Novel.

There are 14 companions, and some of them are more fleshed out than others, but all of them have detailed quest-lines to pursue. The only gripe I might have is that a lot of the triggers for the quests are unknown, so if for example I miss walking into a certain city or area before a certain point in the plot, I might miss out on one of the companions without knowing! 

The combat mechanics are really nice in my opinion, although not too innovative. I admit that I only play turn based, the real time combat is overwhelming for me! The character progression methods are fine, but I especially like the unblocking meridian system. 

The game has a pretty expansive world with a lot of areas, but it does feel empty at certain points, with large swaths of the map having no interesting locations, and a lot of places with silent NPCs (It's even be preferable imo if they had generic NPC lines to repeat).

All in all, I love the game and intend to play it to completion probably more than once!

At the very state, the game is a mess:


- The menus need more polish and be better organized;
- Pacing and battles are out of balance, it's very easy to get completely overrun by an impossible boss fight even if you are strong enough to take care of the side quests. And when I mean impossible I say this with passion;
-Merchants have no importance and often sell the same thing in all the regions of the game;
- When you use consumables, that's not clear in any menus or the UI if you have to eat food with all the party members like in other CRPGs or only with the main character to get buffs;
- The events are confusing, and some times blend with one another;
- There are events that happen with others at the same time, making some side quests break the main quest. Example: a character that dies in one side quest appears again in the main quest like if nothing happened before;


I have played this a ton to say with property that the game is completely out of balance. The pacing is not very clear, the best way for a moderate procedure in the story is kind of a die roll. You go with the flow, and good luck if you are succeeded, because there will be an enemy that takes 3k of damage from the entire party in one attack with no means to avoid it in the main quest.

If you try to go for the main story only, sorry, there's no way, because there wil be no build, no food, no pills that could help you with the ads  in the bosses of this game that are a lot. As an example, many times you'll be engaging battles with a party of five against a strongly overpowered enemy, but the problem is that this strong enemy can destroy your entire party with one or two attacks due to the ads that can be of six and eight. It's really hard, and it's not even possible even with your best cultivation maxed out. Not broken: completely unfair. And there is no way to turn out the situation, except lots of saves through the history so you can proceed the best way in the story due to your previous experience.

That been said, I recommend to wait for more patches to balance really hard the difficulties and the enemy ads that are way too much for you to handle so you have a great experience that this game tries to give but it fails really hard in doing it. It's not because I like the game that I'm not going to be honest with you, guys. So, give it a try in a couple of months or so.",1695513013,1695513013,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is unbelievably well written ~ small grammar mistake in translation shouldnt take away the plot. The names of the characters can be confusing sometimes but if you follow the story - it is definitely a masterpiece. 

So many hidden side quests and side characters you can recruit (or miss) as well as multiple endings; definitely brings more quality to the game. 

Highly recommend and hoping for some small updates here and that'll polish it even better.




============== update ==============
It's nice to see a [developer] follow up comments ~  I'll give a more indepth review and some suggestions then. 

I know youre still working on making the game better, so this isnt negative criticism but just how i feel from a player standpoint. 

What really got me hooked was the storyline - the way it was weaved together was incredible, you pretty much caught my attentions the first 5 minutes of the story - follow by a plot that ""make sense"" and had me curious what was going to happen next - helps that the MC was very likeable as well as the many characters he encountered, it wasnt just thrown together loosely with no justifications and back story ""just because developer says so"" ~ someday more stories will be well written as ""One Piece - Oda"" - where even the most hated guy has a story you can sympathizes. I beat the Wandering Sword actually wanting more background stories on some of them (admittedly i missed a few side characters so i'll probably have to go back and replay it). Which brings me to my next point for suggestions - YOU NEED NEWGAME+ !!  Felt pretty empty right after the last fight. Reset us to a crossroad in the game where choice diverges or something. Make enemy strong, drop better items, whatever it is - better than just abruptly ended with zero replay-ability other than starting a fresh game. 

You need Achievements ~ it's 2023 , every game on steam needs it.

Since the game is so new, there isnt any guides out there for you to help with full side quests, characters, crafting system etc.

I beat the game with all Class II items and (ONE) Class I item (the mask you get).  Left me wondering where in the world was any craft-ability or quests or pick up or places i can farm to even get the manual or materials or if it was even possible. 

The mindless repeat Spar to random item drop was pointless - its nothing more than a timesink; let us pick what we want - not joking when there was some peoplei had to fight over and over again 8x to get the final manual. Why - if i can beat it once i can do it 2nd 3rd 4th - it didnt feel good and felt like a chore instead of progression and accomplishment. The accomplishment ended the first time I struggled and was able to defeat them.


After the event with the Xuan Cult - honest you should have just buffed EVERY dungeon and enemies in the game with the pills - because it gives it more replayability and explorations. Going through old places where youre 100x stronger than the enemy was pointless as well as no reason to even explore them. 

Music could definitely be a bit better as well - 

Graphic - zero complaint since this is the genre ~ 

I played on keyboard because apparently your PS5/XBOX controller port is awful. This game will yield more sales when you can get it on Steam handheld. 

Battle Mechanics was pretty mediocre-meh to be honestly - it wasnt anything special like Octopath or anything unique - 9/10 fight was literally  (walk up, 6, (maybe 5), 3, 2, 4, 1) repeat. It would be a major overhaul to change something like this , so i dont expect it to happen - but something for the studio to think about in the future. It just  didnt feel good because you just took basic battle mechanics and threw it together, not exactly indepth or technical. FF-Tactics was indepth and technical, Turn base like style was more technical, Star Ocean 2 battle was technical. This was meh. Not bad just not good either. But at least it was bareable and playable. 

Anyway , that's all i got for you for now - but honestly though. Well deserved 10/10 considering wuxia isnt maintreamed yet and you were able to deliver something of this high content is so awesome. 

Once you get achievements out and maybe newgame+; i'll come back and finish out all the side characters i missed out on.

The good part
I have been looking for a game based on a martial arts universe for quite a long time and this is the first one that is very pleasant to play, the fights are great, the progression is good, the graphics are great (if you like pixel art), and some quests are really awesome.

For me, this isn't a negative part, it's just that some parts of the game can be improved; I find it a shame that we can't take another faction than Wudang, it would be great to be part of the ""bad guys"" like the condor school or the Xuanhuo cult, or to have the possibility of joining our ""little sister"" at the beginning and be part of the poison gang (I forgot their name) because I think some players aren't really the righteous ones and would rather be an assassin or a cultist. Maybe offer a choice to change way , like being a bad guy, but we can choose if we are going to kill everyone or be a reformed. I also found it a shame that we can't play after the end with a quest with our friends or one of our love interest because there are pngs that we can't interact with or learn their art in the main story because we can't  gifts to them.

In short it's a great game, I really enjoyed it and I'm sure I'll relaunch it if they make good updates, don't forget it came out not so long ago  (a week when I write this) and it's already a good game that I recommend if you like RPG, martial arts and pixel art, do not hesitate try it",1695485464,1695485464,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mastering all forms of cultivation and martial arts you come across, be it by peaceful means like joining a sect or finding a Sifu, or by beating them into submission and into teaching you their families' exclusive art. 
Well, then this game may be right up your alley. If you are new to the Wuxia/Cultivation genre, do not worry this game is a great introduction to the genre. For fans of the genre, this game covers almost every trope that is common in the genre: from Overpowered martial art masters that could swat you down in a single hit like the bug you are, to a female-only sect of martial art masters who perform a deadly (sexy) blade dance (that also happen to fall sway to your sexy MC charm).
The combat system is a lot of fun, having two distinct modes of battle. 1) Strategic turn-based combat, for when you need to ensure that every move you make counts. great for Duels/spars (you will Duel/spar a lot). 2) Real Time action. This is where the combat really shines, even if it is almost pure chaos. For any fan of Wuxia, when you go into battle with a team of 8 cultivators against another team of 8 all moving and activating large martial art explosions, it feels just like every Manhua/LightNovel you could dream of. Practically speaking, this mode of combat is made for grinding enemies weaker than yourself. It will prolly cause a game over if you attempt this form of combat against anyone near your level in a duel format.

The skill/martial art/Dantian growth system in this game is what really makes it shine. I love that you can use 5 different weapon styles, each with their own distinct martial forms and cultivation formations (Blades, Sabers, Hidden knives, Staffs, and Fists). I love collecting as many as I can while I increase my QI flow through my Dantian and Pressure points.

Wandering Sword is a very good Wuxia game, if you are into Chinese Martial Arts games/novels/book this one is a must have. If you are not but enjoy good RPGs with turn-based combat & choices, this one will be right your alley. 

Pros:
-Nice story, both main and side quests. We will see if it ends just as good as it started. I may update may review when I complete the game if my perception of it changes much by then.
-Can recruit a lot of people as companions. They do not interacts outside of their story arc and act just like a unit, but still it is very cool that you are not forced to run with a limited choice of people
-Global map akin to lategame of Tale of Wuxia, but bigger. Transitions are smooth and loading screens are super fast
-Music could have been more diverse IMO, especially town music (so far it is the same for most villages & towns), but overall good. Combat music is a blast
-Main chracter is defined & cannot be customized, but is surprisingly likeable. He is like ""the good guy"" but not ""the blindly rabid short-fused good guy"". At least he is not super-selfish like some other defined Wuxia protagonists.
-Combat overall (quest encounters/spars/duels) is fun and positively challenging.  Random is a factor but only to a certain degree. Power is, but kite is a thing for HW practitioner, with right skills & kite tactics knowledge you can take on enemies far stronger than you.
-English translation is good. In fact, there are some cute artifacts BUT these are not mistakes - actually they are more like a gimmicks to Chinese games translated into English, makes for even better immersion. Don't change it :)

So-so:
-Crafting looks interesting at first glance, however is TOO MUCH reliant on coal. And coal is SOOO hard to find and rare. Like, black gold or dark iron or sapphire or whatever are found and unused like trash. Yet each piece of simple coal is like a treasure.

Cons:
-JRPG-style grind. Lots of weak, similar enemies that respawn fast. Very tedious sometimes.
-No action on global map. There are only some wandering people who never will initiate anything, no random events, no anything. People are wandering around...and unless you pester them to spar/befriend they are just background noise. Can't even rob anybody.
-Real time mode is useless especially since you CANNOT change it during combat or even cutscene. This means if you run through an easy dungeon in real time mode for fast clear of mobs, and then suddenly encounter a cutscene where you will need to be turn-based to win, you will NOT get the option to switch. And there are really no other uses for RT mode.
-Lack of companion dialogue outside of their story ark, not even generic phrases or reactions to some decitions...adding some would have been nice, made them more lively

Overall: 8/10

Game is not perfect, not yet, but I see developers constantly update it so I think it will improve much in the future. Totally worth for any RPG/JRPG fan and a must buy for any CMA/Wuxia/Xianxia/overall chinese folklore fan.",1695475321,1695475696,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many of the companions, and all of the endings, are locked behind various trigger events that provide no guidance to the player at all, and if you miss them, you're shit out of luck, and have wasted dozens of hours.  

I restarted once just a few hours into the game when I first discovered this, and at the time felt there was no harm no foul.  Almost 50 hours in (after a LOT of grinding - remove the stamina system entirely, it serves no purpose other than creating pointless wastes of the players' time), I discovered I must have made some other minor mistake, which I've been unable to pinpoint exactly, and which will lock me out of the ending I was shooting for.

If you're going to implement this style of development, you have to ensure that you provide the guidance to the player IN THE GAME.  If a player is forced to make hundreds of saves and possible need to revert dozens of hours of their invested time to fix something they had no way of knowing, or follow a pre-written guide, well, this sort of early 90's style development was aggravating even back then, and frankly I don't have the time to deal with poor design choices like this these days.

      很久很久没有玩到这种很纯很爽的武侠游戏了。
      最近一段时间一直在找武侠类型游戏，但是一直都找不到小时候玩游戏的那种感觉。
无意中看到了这游戏，抱着试一下的心态打开了，然后一直停不下来，上班也在偷偷玩。
50个小时才打完一周目（上班偷完有很长时间都是在挂机）。真心是很不错的游戏了。
       说几点小建议把。
       1.我觉得应该增加一个难度系统。我很辛苦了练了好就得武功，然后打最终boss几回
合就结束了，真的感觉有点这么多武功白练的感觉。
       2.多周目能增加一些继承系统。比如说我一周目用的剑法，但是收集了很多别的类型
的武学，一直就没用上。二周目我想用拳法了，还要再收集一遍。
       3.队友的归属感太少了，培养了这么久连个结局都没有。队友成了纯纯的工具人了。
       4.后面的剧情有点太赶了，有点虎头蛇尾的感觉。

Reason 1, Leveling up: I love the Meridian mechanic but I feel that the way you get those meridian points as well as some meridians being better than others makes this unique level up mechanic suffer. You need to go through the, honestly, god awful consult mechanic that makes me pull my hair out because any access to cultivation techniques requires you to be at the level of your elders or to grind through several hours of real time just to get the points you need to level up the few cultivation techniques you get (btw, if your playing dont miss out on grabbing the Healthcare method early game)

There is a fair amount of quests and some of them are quite enjoyable or interesting, many plots or mysteries or such. I would say I did probably 85% of the quests in game, missing a lot of potential 'party member quests'. Can have you and up to 4 party members (who you should get as early on as possible as there's no penalties and only benefits to having them.) 

There are 5 types of weapons in the game, each attacking in different patterns,, and many different moves for each with different effects, so you can mix and match effects and damage. There are also lightness moves, which are basically movement abilties, and cultivation techniques, which are basically buffs. Along with that, you can level up all these abilities, along with your 'dantain' which typically improves your stats.

The story was pretty good though somewhat predictable in the end, but still I thourogly enjoyed it and believe it was worth the money. 

The devs also seem to be very good, they have made multiple updates already within like a week of release based on feedback, typically improving the game or patching bugs or doing what the community asks. Very enjoyable and will return if any major updates occur. 

Devs, if you do read this, I think it would be nice to have a save system where there is a ""save now"" button at the top of the manual saves allowing you to make a save by clicking it, and then have all the saves sorted in chronological order, so that it's easy to simply click save and see when/where these saves happened in order.
Also, it would be nice to either have endgame content a bit after the main story (like maybe wandering super strong cultivators) or something, or have the main story say ""the end"" but allow you to play afterwards. Just some suggestions, very much enjoyed the game and strong reccomend!

Good:
+ Good 2.5 pixel graphics

+ Battle System allows for good amount of customization freedom and tactics

+ Female leads and the rest of the companions

- Progress in main story will lock/block some quests
- Main story is a bit cliche

HOWEVER, the gameplay, to put it simply, has not evolved since the 1990s classical wuxia games. That is to say that there is no depth to it at all and is very very repetitive. 

Take combat for example - You simply grind for experience, find new books to lean different styles (which just gives you different attack power, changes how many squares it can hit and add some debuff/buff.) So it becomes really repetitive after an hour. There simply doesn't exist any depth to allow any type of strategy, just a simple 'I win because I punch you harder and faster'.

Outside of combat, the mechanics for levelling up, trading, equipment and meta game are even worse. It is a very simple 'high number is better' approach to gear and the levelling system. 

I really appreciate the fact that the developer put effort into writing the story - I can read Chinese so the original language writing is decent. I tried to push on after 20 hours but there is just no further development in the gameplay which is just too shallow to be enjoyable as an adult that played enough excellent PRG games to know what is the minimum that should be expected . For example, Golden Sun on Gameboy, released 20 years ago, had a much more in depth system...

Yep, even if you don't have enough meridian points or good weapons you can hit harder by levelling the techniques of your preferred weapon (hence raising your proficiency). You just have to grind a little(well, maybe not so little) for gifts (which can be recovered by sparring) and martial points, for the counselling to acquire new techniques and upgrade them.

Although I'm sure there is no need to grind that much, it's just the way I like to play the game, I just find satisfying when I can overpower an opponent who I failed to defeat the first time.

Anyway, what I love about this game so far is this: 
You can take your time with quests, they're not timed, nor limited, that gives you freedom to explore, grind, acquire materials and experience (Aka Martial points) or simply follow the story at your own pace, its really relaxing.
The inventory, it's unlimited! Or so it seems.
The Meridian system is nice, gives you a goal, and you can feel the difference in battles when completing the special nodes.
The art of the portraits is good, ohhh the girls...
The world feels lively with all the travellers (some of them carry great items, spar with them!) in the towns too.
The story follows most of the tropes of the wuxia/xianxia novels: I even fell from a cliff, survived and got an excellent cultivation manual, although I haven't found a spirit grandpa in a ring...

What I would love to have in the game (but is not there) is:
A world map that you can check, the first missions I felt lost but managed.
Also, a recipe book to check outside of the artisans, just because.
But most of all, an info box over the resources to know what I'm gathering.

What I do not like about this game:
The portrait of generic NPCs is the same everywhere, feels like I'm interacting with the same five or six guys over and over, a little bit of diversity would be much appreciated.

That's it for the moment, thanks to the developers and all the people behind this game, one can feel the passion put in there, I'm really enjoying the game.",1695362884,1695363117,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

คะแนนจากสำนักNecromanmklll 55/100 (จาก เนื้อเรื่อง 30/50 , ระบบ 5/30 , ความประทับใจ 20/20)
ความคิดเห็นส่วนตัว - ด้านเนื้อเรื่อง ถือว่าเป็นเกมคอมพิวเคอร์ที่มีเนื้อเรื่องและเนื้อหาในแบบนิยายกำลังภายในร่วมสมัยที่ค่อนข้างน่าติดตาม(คนละอย่างกับแนวแฟนตาซีพื้นบ้านของจีน) แต่ก็ยังอยู่ในพื้นฐานของพาโรดี้อยู่ด้วยข้อจำกัดทางค่านิยมด้านความเชื่อทางลิขสิทธิ์และการเมือง แต่ก็ยังถือว่าทำได้ดี เนื้อเรื่องออกจะเป็นเส้นตรงเกินไปหน่อย ไม่ค่อยมีแขนง ตัวเลือก หรือมุมมองด้านต่างๆของผู้แต่งเนื้อเรื่องถูกนำเสนอ มีแค่การไปยุ่งเกี่ยวกับเควสรองที่ไม่ค่อยมีผลประทบกับเควสหลัก(ต่างกันแค่ฉากจบ) เพราะข้อจำกัดของระบบของเกม การทำงาน ระยะเวลา เลยไม่มีเนื้อเรื่อง ตัวแปร ความเป็นไป เส้นทาง มุมมอง ด้านอื่นๆ ถูกทำขึ้นมาใส่ลงในเกมเพื่อนำเสนอ อย่างเช่น""หากกลุ่มตัวเองหนีรอดจากการลอบสังหารช่วงต้นเกม?"" ""หากตัวเอกรอดมาเพียงคนเดียวแล้วต้องผจญยุทธภพด้วยตัวเอง?"" ""หากตัวเอกไม่ได้เข้าเป็นศิษย์ประจำสำนักใด?"" ""หากตัวเองไปยุ่งกับการเมืองฝั่ง4มือปราบมากกว่าความขัดแย้งในยุทธภพ?"" ""หากตัวเอกเลือกที่จะค้นหาต้นกำเนิดของตนเอง?"" ""หากตัวเอกเข้าไปอยู่ในฝ่ายมาร?"" ฯลฯ และอะไรอื่นๆที่ยังไม่ได้ยกมากล่าว ,
ด้านระบบ ระบบต่อสู้ก็ถือว่าเป็นแนวสเตจี้เทินเบสที่สนุกดี บรรยายวรยุทธกับความโดดเด่นในแต่ละแขนงได้ค่อนข้างน่าสนใจ ผมเองก็สนใจในส่วนของเนื้อเรื่องมากกว่าล่ะนะ ระบบก็เลยกลายเป็นข้อจำกัดและอุปสรรค์แขนงหนึ่งที่คนทำเกมต้องตีโจทย์และใช้งานในการใช้บรรยายร่วมกับเนื้อเรื่องล่ะนะ และด้วยข้อจำกัดที่มีกัน ในส่วนนี้ก็เลยยังทำได้ไม่ค่อยดีเท่าไหร่น่ะนะ ,
ด้านความประทับใจ ที่ให้เต็มเพราะผมชอบนิยายแนวกำลังภายในล่ะนะ ไม่ค่อยมีคนทำเกมหรือนิยายแนวนี้เพราะอัคลักษณ์ที่โดดเด่นและเนื้อเรื่องเนื้อหาที่ค่อนข้างซับซ้อน ทั้งค่านิยมเดิมที่ไม่ค่อยมีคนกล้าทำลายขอบเขต(เพราะเรื่องการเมืองและเรื่องผูกขาดผลประโยชน์น่ะ) ทั้งมุมมองความคิดทรรศนะคติที่จะถูกนำเสนอผ่านเนื้อเรื่องรวมถึงการสะท้อนมุมมองด้านต่างๆ อย่างในแนวกิมย้งจะสะท้อนความเป็นไปทางการเมืองและวิถีชีวิตของผู้คนผ่านกำลังอำนาจและคนที่เกี่ยวข้อง ส่วนโกวเล้งจะไปทางสะท้อนความโลดโผนในยุทธภพแบบนอกกฏหมายหรือกลุ่มอาชญากรรม พวกรุ่นหลังๆที่ตามๆมาส่วนใหญ่จะไปทางความสัมพันธ์ของตัวละคร วีระชนสยบกลียุค ประโลมโลก หรือยอดยุทธสุดแกร่ง อะไรพวกนี้เป็นส่วนใหญ่ล่ะนะ ถึงเกมจะทำออกมาได้มีข้อจำกัดมากไปหน่อย แต่ก็ยังเป็นแนว""กำลังภายใน""อยู่ล่ะนะ ไม่ใช่แบบวิถีเซียนสุดแฟนตาซีไร้จำกัดอะไรแบบนั้นน่ะ ,
ข้อความส่งท้าย(ให้แก่ฝ่ายผู้สร้างเกม) คือถ้าจะอัพเดทเปลี่ยนแปลงหรือเพิ่มอะไรเข้าไปก็อย่าเพิ่มราคาเกมล่ะ ชื่อ""กระบี่พเนจร""นี่ก็ถือว่ายังพอโอเคอยู่(ถึงจะไม่ค่อยมีอะไรเท่าไหร่ให้สมชื่อก็เถอะ) แล้วหากจะทำภาค2หรือภาคต่อ ก็อย่าลืมหาวิธีแก้จุดด้อยที่ว่ามาพวกนั้นด้วยนะ ไม่งั้นเกมคงน่าเบื่อน่ะ เพราะว่าสื่อที่เป็น""เกมคอมพิวเตอร์""นั้น เป็นคนละอย่างกับ""นิยาย/กำลังภายใน""ล่ะนะ .",1695362267,1695362267,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

  1.a related, you cant switch battle modes during the battle or in the beginning of a battle, so its quite easy to die if you forget to switch back to the turn-based version before the boss.
  1.b there is no quick save button/hot key available. Last used save slots are all the way at the bottom, need to scroll down every single time.

I really enjoyed this game and I hope there will soon be a DLC of some sorts to see more of a happy ending with one of the FL that he ends up with. I also wish that you could add some more sects to the game if possible, I would love to see a Mount Hua Sect, Demonic Cult, Emei Sect, e.g, although I guess some sects fill in these gaps of the sects I mentioned. One problem I do have, is after you achieve one of the endings you could still explore afterwards just in case you want to just roam around the map or do some quests you forgot to do.

Pros:
The art style is incredible, there are multiple ways to fight through the game, and the storyline is full of characters and quests. If you like Pixel Art RPG games like Octopath Traveller, then you should really try Wandering Sword!

Cons:
The game says that there are multiple endings, however, you can't really tell if your actions change anything.

I'll be looking forward to what these devs do in the future, because as much fun as I had and as good as I think the experience was, there are areas for improvement. Plus it would be great to see more games that fit this specific genre blend.

Here's what I liked:
* I happen to be a fan of this genre of story so I was really happy to get to play an RPG in the setting.
* The scenery was wonderful, some of the areas I'd even describe as beautiful to look at despite being pixelated.
* Character animations were good!
* Truly a ton of different options for how to build your character and (optionally) your party. Want to swing a magic sword and destroy a bunch of enemies at once? You got it. Prefer long-ranged attacks making use of poison? Easy. Wanna punch that arrogant jerk in the face repeatedly? Say no more. Not just weapon/skill sets, but the meridian point system gives you an extra layer of customization so you can build a truly unique hero.
* There was a lot of stuff to do, and I'm confident I missed out on quite a bit even in 70 hours for a playthrough since I didn't even locate all of the recruitable characters.
* Resource grinding is never exciting and I appreciate that there are tips on many items to help you figure out where to go to find or purchase them.


Areas for improvement:
* The UI is a bit of a struggle at times. This isn't a major issue, but occasionally some weird things would happen where activating a menu button would lead to a separate menu opening/menu item being selected. I've also had to reload a fair few times because I accidentally had real-time combat activated and there's no way to change it once you're in a cutscene or combat.
* There are a lot of great things in the game that reward you for exploring and even some hints to point you in the directions of interesting things, but in a game with so many different places you could go, maybe just a little bit more help getting to the cool and interesting things would be good.",1695314675,1695314675,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Earning affinity is somewhat silly, as it is mainly gained through gifts, but the side-quests and side-stories you get help you learn more about the characters and the world. 

Chat bars could use some work. It is hard to scroll down every time a character talks too much. 

Art is beautiful, combat is fun and strategic, the plot is enticing if you like Wu Xia novels — and every other NPC has an interesting backstory that is rewarding to explore.

The combat is similar to traditional Final Fantasy games, although if you've seen the trailer, that would be obvious. Wandering Sword handles leveling a little differently, though. Rather than gaining EXP from fighting or completing quests, you have to unlock new Cultivation techniques. This is an interesting approach to character growth and fits the ""Cultivation"" aesthetic. That being said, at a certain point, this is going to force you to do the main story to learn new skills to level up.

The main story is decent, but the side quests are where it really shines. Almost every town and city has interesting quests with good rewards and significant storytelling. There are even huge quest chains that allow you to recruit unique companions. It really makes the world fun and engaging to explore because you never know what you'll find. The game in no way shies away from mature themes either.

As far as mechanics go, there's a massive array of options for character building and customization... There's also really no wrong way to invest your experience either, as all cultivations provide useful meridian points (which allow you to buy passive stat buffs and abilities). As for meridians, some are definitely way better than others, but you can theoretically eventually get them all. The tactical grid combat is also really fun and some of the harder battles can be pretty intense.

My only complaint is the weapon balance is kind of whack. Sabers are king (IMO), with swords and hidden weapons being about on par, while staves and fist weapons feel a bit lackluster...

Character and plot are really generic and tropey. Characters are written as one dimensional (mostly). It does not seek to challenge or break any new grounds in storytelling. 10 hours in I don't even know where the story is going or what is the motivation of the main character. Other playable characters are also inconsistent in their presentation. 
In terms of narrative, it feels disjointed. First part of the game I went out looking for someone, then I joined the martial school, and days just went by. Like, what happens to the person I'm looking for? If this game wanted the story to focus on the particular martial art school then game should just start from the school and go on from there instead of you know, went out chasing after kidnapped person and ended up joining the school...like what is the MC even doing

Leveling and exploration and probably the most problematic. Sometimes I'm just stuck and unable to complete any quest because I'm too weak, and I have no idea where to go because enemies everywhere are too strong. Progression is also problematic because you can't just grind, you also need to grind the exploration aspect to find the skills etc. Grinding in this game is also slow and long. Quest rewards are really underwhelming.

Party and combat are ok but it's really messy. Sometimes characters join you and make every combat trivial, then the quest complete and just leaves... 
I understand that character join and leaves due to common cultivation genre narrative but it does not translate well into gameplay.
Different skills aren't distinguished enough, every attack mostly just do damage. There are so many things that the devs could've done with combat to make it more in depth but really missed opportunity. Even something common in other games like counter system or status effect would've made it much better imo. I don't even care about what build I'm going for because it all feels the same, sadly.

Npc system is really the highlight, but once again, messy. Sparring for instance is a great idea but I think a lot of characters doesn't need to spar, like, beating up an old herbalist doesn't add anything to the game. It only makes sense to spar with other martial artists. I do like the consult system.",1695232318,1695252861,True,2,0,0.513833999633789063,0,True,False,False

Since developers read these reviews I'll bring up some points.

-Beating NPC's in spars should give a line or 2 of dialogue. It felt very dissapointing that I got no reaction when I went around beating up sect leaders for their stuff.
-Achievements would be very nice.
-We should be able to view completed quests to figure out where recruitable NPC's are. I couldn't figure out where the death-opera raven bird lady and her boyfriend were which was unfortunate.
-There is maybe a little too much backtracking in areas. Beating a boss and then dodging the minions is a little bit annoying. Especially the entrance to the Wuxian sect is quite a drag.
-Add a quest checklist when you defeat the final boss so we can go back and do any side content we may have missed.
-Some party stats in post-battle screen would be cool. Stuff like damage done, damage received, ...
-Advanced blueprints make finding any gear in the wild or gear received from quests worthless which is unfortunate. Making quest items more unique could better solve this issue.
-Some more interesting moves would be cool. Maybe things that could affect the terrain? Like traps?
-More varied types of win and lose conditions. Currently its either live or die and sometimes survive for a couple of turns. Objectives where we have to defend something or reach another place would be cool.
-Stuff to do when we beat the main story. A boss gauntlet maybe? An endless mode with ramping  enemy difficulty to see how strong your party is?

Battles kinda plays like a turn based rpg grid game like wartales or record of argrest war or disgaea, with a map like battle brothers, but has autobattle once you get a full party (MC + 4) and can semi afk farm skill points. Beefing up the main character can be painful but is rewarding, your gonna be ""weak"" try to build him as a duelist (1v1), start with some defense and double down on energy/turn economy. 28 hours in and not even half way through the game.  Game has the choice of 12 or so different companions, you get quite a few during the story missions, and some from side quests. It's not budget octopath like some reviewers have said unless you literally didn't play either game. It is not the same combat type nor can you just run hunter and capture a golem to 1 shot most of the game. The game is actually hard. Story and dialog is fairly good for a game of this type.

Edit: Just to respond to the developer response, difficulty is subjective, but I will give you an example, when you go to the ""mirage waters"" you have a party of 5 you can kill all the crocs with no issue, then you run into fight a random boss ""Lin Tianhan the soul-reaping swordmaster"" he has 13000hp (i got like 4k atm) or something and you are expected to 1v1 him out of nowhere, your party just out of nowhere leaves u to die to him? No indicator it's a duel, stuff like that feels kinda bad. If this is intended to be a duel there should be an indicator or some context, outside red nameplate... A guy who's got 6k hp is ranked the same as this guy. I expect if someone is ""invincible rank for example from spar NPC's"" they should wipe the floor with me as a lowly master or slightly above that's OK, that's why the progression feels good when you can start tackling higher ranks. Out in the field red enemies are just red, but when you walk in it could be a dude with 6k hp and 1k dmg or a 17k boss with 3k dmg and drags you into a 1v1 which is kinda a kick in the nuts with no context what happened to my party. 

There should be an indicator it be a ""rank score like for NPC's before you spar"" or just more colors for each rank above your own such as gold for invincible tier or unrivaled tier just to show you should save before getting one shot. Expecting the player to save before any red fight does feel sorta bad balance-wise even though I do enjoy the challenge, I can see how it would feel unfair since you literally cannot ""outplay them"" one aoe will one shot you regardless of moving during auto-battle to avoid attacks before they are casted, and turn based it is a strait up death sentence. No counter play so it's ""start popping pills son"" moment. Which will put people off who have not played new game + of Y's or other games that require stat development outside normal JRPG fanfare.

The developers are really active in the community, making constant fixes and replying to people with new information and not the generic copy pasted responses, really makes it feel like they care and are actively taking part in the community.

The story feels like a classic wuxia story, and given this is my first time actually buying an wuxia game i've had a really good time. If you play it well, you can grind enough to max everything you need (cultivation and new weapon skills for mastery) within an hour, maybe more, and after that the passive Martial Points you get just from playing the game and completing the story allows you to build up a large reservoir of Points making it easy to max out. 

To anyone struggling to get stronger and get better, you should be focusing on getting cultivation manuals, as well as ""observing"" npcs to see if they have the recipes you need to craft better gear. It really is an RPG game through and through, so I'm not quite sure why people are complaining that they aren't strong enough to beat the game, when a majority of RPG games need you to grind somewhat to get stronger.

There are some minor bugs and things that I think could do with improvement, but they aren't enough to deter me from playing the game at all. Things like regular saving in different slots to allow for different versions to jump back to, make a great difference and even allow for you to avoid making choices you didn't realise you had to.

As for some of the things that I think could be improved, is the ability to repurchase or get things you sold back. What I'm referring to is the fact that when I started playing the game I thought I would not be using the party aspect of the game (oh how wrong I was), but when I eventually started gathering party members, I could not teach them things like cultivation methods I had learned because... I had sold them without realising the importance of them. Additionally, I could not find anywhere to repurchase them, so I think either adding in a place or location (maybe something like a pawn shop?) that specifies in offering you items you have sold and therefore you can go there to repurchase items? 

That's all I can think of for now, but overall the game has been a great experience and I can't wait to finish the story, very grateful for the devs and all the staff, keep up the hard work :)",1695213347,1695213347,True,1,0,0,3,True,False,False

Its a good game, though kinda find the ending kinda unsatisfying maybe there's multiple ending I only know 2 of it.

Also your character is a GENIUS cultivator but has VERY LOW STATS which makes it kinda weird cause it kinda contradicts, so you end up pumping him with pills so that he can be one of the strongest. (side characters has 3-4x more stats than him)

Anyways if you're into RPG games and kinda bored play this game.",1695210575,1695210575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought this game on a whim for some old school RPG nostalgia and honestly it hit the mark. The story is interesting, the turn based combat scratches the itch, and there is a good amount of content within the game, well worth the asking price. Has some issues with quality of life features but overall is a enjoyable experience. 

Pros: 
-Story is entertaining. It stays on pace throughout the game and it doesn't feel like you're progressing too fast or too slow. Keeps you engaged the entire time and you become invested into the story line. Probably the best and most important thing about this game.
-Translation is done very well.
-Turn based combat is fun and done in a unique and refreshing new way. Could use a little tuning to diversify the skills but overall is good.
-All of characters feel unique (except the shaolin guys), each have their own backstory and motivations. They are done well and flesh out the world.


Cons: 
-There are several side stories that don't feel finished. 
-Ending leaves no clues as to what happens to your companions you get throughout the journey making it feel like you wasted your time on their side quests and story lines. 
-There are quality of life issues such as not being able to access the main menu during combat. 
-Most of the abilities feel the same. Only difference is the weapon type which gives you access to different play styles. 
-Crafting is unbalanced and extremely costly.
-Your choices don't seem to do much beyond giving you a slightly different ending.
-Character scaling is unclear and difficult to understand.


Suggestions:
-New game + would be awesome for this game. 
-Flesh out the companions by adding to their side story with more quests and content.
-Add the ability to open up the menu during battles.
-Ending should have more to substance about companion, where they are and more information about the changes in the world brought about by your decisions in the main story. 
-Post game or end game optional dungeons would be awesome.
-Adjust how to train crafting, or just get rid of it completely. Doesn't do anything but waste time and money and just adds unnecessary grinding.
-More side quests in the later stages of the game. Game starts off with plenty but doesn't have many towards the end.

The way grinding works, a lot of things like gear recipes and techniques you have to obtain before you can push yourself even further.  So obscenely over leveling content is mostly impossible save for a canned story event.

(1) is the fact that auto save isnt auto saving as frequent as i'd hoped so whenever my character dies... i found myself having to do that quest all over again which... sucks badd XD... can it at least always auto save whenever we enter any town or city or sects?

(2) the second is... i am confuse as how to increase my character's strenght, health, mana and stamina... is there like a level system? or is just through artifacts and pills? but all the artifacts sold at market are all 30-60 damage at best... and there is no physiciant that sells any increasing hp, mp, stamina pills. Do i have to craft a weapon myself if i want the damage to increase? soo... i am hoping you can please help me clarify on that? or maybe i have to invest in meridian?

also i just wanted to add something for curious reasons... i was hoping that you would add a gender choose system where the player gets to choose which type of gender they would like to play as! Not that i dont like male main character, i just feel that being a girl in that timeline and rising to the top with pure strength and wits is more rewarding, y'know? For me anyway~

Combat is never too difficult, though if you want it to be, you could always challenge very strong martial artists to duels, which i found to be a fun element of the game. You're rewarded for defeating people in sparring by getting some of the stuff they have in their pockets, so if you see that they've got something good in their inventory and think you can take them in battle it's very satisfying to take their stuff to power up more. Took me 37 hours to complete the main story, though i have a good amount of side quests to clean up and other martial arts abilities to track down and steal.

Hoping the dev releases either more content or works on a sequel or a spiritual successor with the same combat and vibe, because i would insta-buy it.

Without spoiling the story, I'll focus on the good and bad I've experienced while rushing through.

The Good:
- The characters, when they have a solid story line and their motives for setting out into the wuling world.
  - I can safely say the characters' backstory and twists are inspired by, if not taking some cues from Jing Yong's novels (金庸小說: 天龍八部)
- The art is finely crafted and varied with the attention to details in their environment.
- The backstory of the game world is a high point for me (if a bit cliched having read a number of wuxia novels).
  - Factional Fighting and sect/cult ambitions reminds me of Jing Yong's novels (金庸小說: 笑傲江湖)
  - A cult that worships the flame (明教)
  - Shaolin and Wutang are still the 2 premier sects.

The Bad
- Grind. Lot's of it, can't state this enough and I resorted to some tools to get past it.
  - Weak MC, the base stats on the MC is so pathetically bad that almost all companions can crush the MC in sparring unless you know what you're doing. 
  - The player is supposedly able to overcome this by being able to learn ALL and EVERY techniques in the game... which leads to more grind.
- Unclear affections system (you start sparring at 20 and unlock some companion quests above 20 affection, but not all companions have quests and some companions can only be recruited when you have 60+ affection).
  - Story companions' affection is apparently only increased in interactions, which can be easily missed...
  - Companion gifts were difficult to find in my experience...
- Clunky UI and missing Quality of Life
  - No Fast Travel; I really disliked having to manually run from one side of the world map to another for side quests... I'd suggest placing a horse/stable outside cities or outside the inns maybe if immersion is an issue.
- Useless vendors
  - Legit, all equipment upgrades comes from fighting and by mid game, all equipment are grade 5 from random mob drops... and anything above grade 5 are almost exclusively boss drops...
  - So to get better equipment and crafting better ones, you're back to grinding, [i]again[/i].

The lack of voice acting isn't/wasn't an issue for me and the audio suited the game (can't say it is stellar either, but they were well-suited to their environment).

A solid 8/10 simply based on the art presentation, story building, and world building. I look forward to the possible content updates and improvements in the future. And hopefully, more games and titles from the studio.",1695026728,1695026728,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

从剧情描述来说，我还以为主角可以自由选择门派和武学路线，结果好像只能强制入武当？虽然可以学其他的功法，但是这还是相当的拘束了自由度。给我的感觉还是制作组比较赶。你们有玩自己的游戏嘛？最终BOSS我打起来跟揍小朋友一样，还给我来了个“剧情倒地”。真的给我整的很割裂。我打最终BOSS血皮都没怎么掉，非要给我剧情来一个倒地，好强，打不过，友军来支援。。。很割裂。本来将希望寄托在二周目更难的选项上，结果发现没有难度选项，寄。

There are quite a number of things that I'd say need improvement so that it's not so indie in quality : 
- The choice of font in the game arguably makes it look very indie-ish. This is what sets it apart from games like Octopath.
- I'm not the biggest fan of the interaction system with the NPC where to increase affinity level, we need to gift them an item.
- Generic NPC portraits which are being reused for other NPCs.

1. 剧情非常老套，缝合了一堆东西，仅有极少数的亮点剧情。
2. 游戏性基本为0，战斗模式是以前的金群X，武功除了加系数，基本看不见区别。
3. 支线任务极其敷衍，不是从A到B的送东西，就是去到C点搜集材料。
4. 任务之间还有逻辑bug，A已经死了，还能接到A相关的任务。

- Companions' location: some companion that I have to remove from the party they return to their location and I forget where they are, when I want to find them to take them with me is time consuming
- Some side quest is difficult, like the quest that take the detective Leng (wheelchair man) escape from the village after the siege in the mountain where the fight is too difficult to fight both the strong boss like Ye Fei and the Dragon Peril and many minions mob.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Wuxia is awesome and this game actually gets it. Not sure if any game I've played without a full on translation mod has really captured it the way this one does.
+ Gameplay is fun, reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics. The 1v1 duels make you feel like a beast.
+ Hunting down martial art techniques, weapons, crafting recipes, pills etc makes me want to grind and catch them all pokemon style.
+ Story is great. Main story is really solid so far (I'm nearly 30 hours in but have done a lot of side quests and grinding, no end in sight yet) and there are tons of extensive side quests which are really well thought out and interesting.
+ Translation is basically perfect. There are some wtf moments, but it's really solid.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Stamina system is pretty bad. I think the devs could literally remove stamina from the game completely and the game would be better for it.
- Some QoL things are still missing, but the devs seem to be releasing updates to fix them. A few off the top of my head: 
not being able to quit, reload or restart fights when you know you've lost gets frustrating; 
inventory management is pretty bad - sort by type doesn't also sort by rarity; 
vendors seem mostly useless, don't think I've found a single vendor who sells actually useful items; 
you get the bulk crafting recipes way after you've already exceeded the item tier, like receiving tier 6 crafts from blacksmiths in zones where you're getting tier 4s. 
A few more, but honestly all pretty minor. 
- Side quests don't really exist very much in the zones outside of the Central Plains, would've loved a bit more content in the other zones.
- Red girl keeps bullying me (maybe this is a +).
- (Not at the end yet, but my understanding is there isn't any New Game+ or endgame really).

[b]Some things that are questionable:[/b]
~ Meridian system is a bit strange to be gated behind cultivation methods I think. As a progression system it works, but in the theme of wuxia I don't really think it makes sense for my character to be gaining power by learning 500 cultivation methods which they don't care about - should be more rewarding to just focus on a limited set.
~ Crafting is super grindy but very rewarding.
~ Game gets a bit too easy if you grind at all - would be awesome if there was a difficulty setting for more challenge.
~ Makes sense storywise, but feels like sword is pushed onto you a bit too much. I've been playing sabers, and it's been hard to find a lot of techniques because none of the righteous sects really use them, I imagine it'd be the same for throwing weapons.

Overall this game is like a 9/10 for me, maybe higher if the story wraps up well. Hard recommend.
The only thing I want now is this game, but in a more sandboxy format where I can make my own character, join other sects, be my own wuxia.",1694969589,1694970021,True,25,1,0.725428938865661621,0,True,False,False

I play many JRPG and when i saw this at a game con (i forgot which one) my interest was perk, after buying and playing the game there was a few things i like:
The story seem interesting
The world was interesting
Character writing was good
Music was good

But that was it, the actually gameplay side of thing was the bigger turnoff for me, i don't mind turn base heck ill say it my favorite type of game but this game combat system seem lack luster in stragety, it just go in use all your skill on CD and repeat which made me use ""real-time"" more often as most encounter took waaay to long for to me a landside victory and realtime gameplay is just a auto battler for me expect u only control the MC which made the game even more boring for me.
Last thing is how this game feel like a Korean MMO, it not their fault really ,but down to the sidequest, menu, the skill menus, and how items already have white-Gold rarity in the first few hours just make the experience not really liking that format after playing a few back in days and this game being in that format felt really off for me.
Bonus: The controller layout is uber scuff, Im used to games where B/O (xbox/ps4/5 layout) is accept but this game for some reason make A the accept/interaction but dialogue requires B to continue but B is also back, make navigating through menus and character dialogue pretty confusing, controller for combat is pretty fun but also hard to tell what u are selecting in some cases, it definite need some work as playing on the steam deck is a challenge

The pixel arts are stunning, the music are beautiful, and the combat system are one of the best one I've played in a turn-based game in a while.  I didn't know the ability to mix and match fighting style from a different school to customize your MC can be so much fun.

You focus on  martial arts style that fits the weapon type you want to use.  You can upgrade your proficiency in that martial arts style using the experience you get from battles and from martial books.  You also have skills you can use separated into a special move, a super powerful area wide attack, a movement skill, and a cultivation skill (helps you regain your qi faster (used for attacks, so it kinda functions like a battle timer).  What's cool about the system is that you can find new martial arts styles/books/skills that will teach you new skills that you can employ and upgrade.  As time goes on and you increase your proficiency in said skills, you gain meridian points.  Meridian points are points that you can spend on your attributes.  In this game, its also related to eastern viewpoints of where these meridians are in your body and the pathways which the energy flows.  You can't just dump your points into wherever you choose (at least, you can't yet).  Only 1 path is open to you  at the start and you must unlock the others as time goes on.  This makes the game much more interesting to me than a lot of other rpgs.  I've never seen it before honestly and its refreshing.  I wonder how the game will play out as more and more paths unlock and how player choice can allow for different outcomes.  So, basically the game checks all my boxes:  Story, interesting game mechanics, art.

To start off the combat is incredibly fun where can you choose up to 5 different weapons, which you can focus on based on preference no matter what you choose this makes it really fun and unique in their own way 10/10. 
As for the story so far I think its really interesting similar to that of manhua which I give it 8/10 only cause no choice in dialogue that changes the story or path.
Last thing I want to talk about is the difficulty and progression so far, in my run its has been going strong though the start was really hard in my opinion since I was going polearm but besides that the game does challenge you which makes it competitive and fun with the enemies and situation your going to encounter. Along that the progression to be is medium at times its hard and at times its easy depending how you bulid your character and what weapon you chose so Im give it 9/10.

[b]I wholeheartedly RECOMMEND this game to any RPG lovers. This game is the BEST first impression I have experienced since playing games on steam hands down[/b]. 

I have a relative modest games collection on steam across AAA, AA & indie titles. Of all my collection; this game has definitely positively stood out the most for me.

Postives:

1) beautiful pixel 2.5D graphics with the best execution of depth of field and shadows I’ve seen in pixel art type games

2) controls are very intuitive [b]even[/b] on Steam Deck where I personally haven’t had any issues. I want to stress the accessibility of controls as I was apprehensive buying this game based on other reviews complaining about buggy gamepad controls… In my personal experience; [b] gamepad controls works great out of box [/b].

3) the game mechanics & in-game setting including fore-mentioned art style is both well thought out & engaging. For an indie title this hands down beats many AAA Square Enix, NIS America like tiles. This is my personal opinion and I also enjoy all games from those very respectable respective AAA studios/publishers as well.

I can see the game devs here are extremely responsive (probably the most I’ve personally encountered), where they’ve positively responded to both positive & negative (including troll comments). I commend the devs & that deserve every recognition & success for what they’ve produced.

Ok but nothing too interesting.

Game play
-Pretty boring. It's grind-ier than any grinding game you will ever play. Even mobile games are tiers above this game
-EXP rate is god tier low, and by low
-You pretty much wipe to every encounter and a main plot character pretty much carries you through story fights
-The enemy sprite pallete has no variety
-The amount of terror from boredom, of the fights, is enough to make you mentally unstable. I've only played like 5 hours but I already have a lethal dose of PTSD.

All the familiar systems are here and the game affords you plenty of latitude to build your hero (and even your companions) the way you want. There's 5 different weapon types that you can choose from along with the usual myriad of skills unique to each type. Internal Styles must be cultivated to unlock Acupuncture points, which can be used to further define your character build and earn unique buffs. Some IS are generic but some are linked to specific weapon types or even to all weapon skills from a certain region. Again, it's hard to determine the depth of options but so far they are fun to play around with.

Battles are turn-based in a grid system (as well as with an optional real-time option in which the AI takes over your companions, essentially as a way to accelerate easier battles). Pretty much everything the hero does and learns goes to increasing his combat stats including the usual (ATK, DEF, Crit, Evasion) but the game also allows you to improve other interesting stats such as Movement (base movement speed in grids for your character, which can also be buffed in battle via skills) and more importantly Qi Gathering, which improves your turn order. This game has one of the better initiative / turn systems I've seen in a while, as every character has a certain amount of seconds they must gather Qi before they can take a turn (eg, with 100 Qi Gathering it takes 5 seconds for this character to act, and with 120 QG it only takes 4.5 seconds). Items, equipment and even some of your skills may affect how much Qi you gather or how much you start a battle / turn with, and there's really no limit to how many turns a faster character can take around slower ones (ie, a character who has turns every 2 seconds will simply go twice against a character who has a turn every 5 seconds). It kinda reminds me of the time system in 7.62 High Calibre which I found very enjoyable.

It seems that companions can be recruited through a very simple gift / affinity system but I've only recruited one so far, as even companions which will eventually be playable have refused to accept my gifts and join my party. I assume that some / all of it is bound by the story. I suppose it makes sense as I would otherwise already have a few heroes in my party which are more powerful than my hero by an order of magnitude.

Speaking of the story, there's a main quest which seems pretty linear and through which you unlock your powers and go from zero to hero. I was happy to find out that ~2 hours into the game (after tutorials and such) I was allowed to wander off and away from the main quest, explore the region and indulge in sidequests or just exploring. 3 of my 5 hours in the game so far were spent wandering, fighting (losing) battles against much stronger opponents which I wasn't supposed to see yet and gathering / crafting items. With how open the world is and how powerful the items you can get from crafting are, I imagine there's plenty of room for simply running around, gathering items while avoiding tougher enemies, and eventually craft more powerful items than you should be ready for.

In terms of translation, so far the game is flawless. It won't receive any awards for its writing (at least not in its English version, I have a pet peeve against Sect leaders saying something like ""OK, it's fine"") but at least I haven't run into any untranslated sections or senseless machine translations. However, anyone who's played these games knows that translations tend to become rougher the further you go into the game so we'll see how it goes.

TL;DR: Great for players who enjoy Wuxia games. Tactical combat, plenty of build customization, relatively free exploration with no level-scaling. Go buy it, support the genre and more translations for the Western audience.",1694865175,1694865558,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a fan of wuxia novels and manhua, this is an absolute gem.

The plot may not be very unique, but that is perfectly fine within the Wuxia theme, rather, I welcome it. The way we start with no cultivation, no weapons and being able to really learn pretty much every single skill is great, it's what I am into rpgs for.

The combat took me by surprise at first, I didn't expect it to be turn based strategy but it strangely works really well with the game. It can be changed to real time, but I haven't really felt like changing since I'm enjoying it as is.

Something really ""unique"" per se is how you can forge friendships with dozens of ncps, all with their different background story. You can also most of the ncps, after beating them they'll give you one of their items which could be recipes, cultivation manuals or random items.

At this point I realize there are certain sections that I have leveled into yet, but by working to improve my gear and character skills I've learned that I can go to specific places it's been helpful.  I know this may be an acquired taste, but overall it's good for those people looking for an updated rpg experience that hallows old school and new school graphics.

It's safe to say my expectations were met and exceeded.

In short, it is similar to Live A Live and Octopath Traveler in art direction, gameplay, and atmosphere, but with a Wuxia theme and its own unique ingredients to the formula—like its more tactical combat, linear story with many choices (as opposed to the multiple short story style of the aforementioned games), and relationship point system, to name a few.  All the systems come together in a satisfying a fun way, and if you like turn-based Wuxia games—especially with this type of cozy art style—I can certainly recommend Wondering Sword.

---

+ Beautiful and cozy pixel graphics and atmosphere (very reminiscent of Octopath Traveler)
+ Engaging turn-based combat and battle mechanics
+ Interesting story and decent English translation
+ Likable (and properly hate-able) characters
+ Decently deep NPC relationship point system, often leading to new allies, quests, and other bonuses
+ Excellent Steam Deck support

- Typesetting is a little generic (perhaps only important to me, a graphic designer/artist and typography nerd, but *please* use a more unique English font that maintains legibility; it adds so much character and quality to a game)
- Gifting and sparring with NPCs to raise affection is a bit repetitive and feels a little generic (for example, saying the same thing after every gift)
- The English translation isn't bad, but it does *feel* like just a translation at a few uncommon moments, lacking personality in some phrases and conversations
- Sometimes there's a bit of a mismatch in art style (for example, some trees are lower resolution than others or even fully 3D models rather than pixel art billboards)—not really an issue, but a small critique from an artist
- No ultrawide support—but really, this isn't a deal breaker here",1694810296,1694810475,True,5,0,0.554046690464019775,0,True,False,False

(Many of the negative Chinese reviews are complaining about the UI / resolution and gamepad support. I will address these below.)

You are probably here if you like games like 2.5D games like Octopath, Triangle Strategy or the Live-A-Live remake; or at least the RPG genre in general. You're in luck - Wandering Sword (sort of) came out of nowhere, but it will almost certainly scratch that itch you know you have.

What surprised me the most is the apparent depth. There are quest systems, relationship systems, crafting systems, items, equipment, multiple weapon and attack types, at least 3 different ways to level up your characters, a roster of 15 heroes -- *takes a breath* and pretty great graphics and music too. 

It's an imperfect experience however - the minimum resolution is 1080p, meaning you'll only be able to play it comfortably when docked if you are on Steam Deck. There are no UI scaling options, despite desperately needing them. Also, the gamepad controls are technically 100% functional, but it feels like one of the console iterations of the Infinity Engine games. That is, it feels *pretty* good,  but certain things are clunky and it could have done with a few extra weeks in testing.

Wondering about the translation? Worry not - it isn't Shakespeare, but it is better than most mobile games and certainly better than the last few Sword and Fairy translations.

Pros:
+ Good story, interesting characters, genuine Wuxia vibe
+ Lots and lots of systems to play with 
+ Huge scope - closer to Western style RPGs 
+ Great implementation of 2.5D
+ Fun, semi-tactical combat with lots of options

Cons:
- If you aren't into Wuxia, it will be slightly disorienting
- UI and controls needs just a little more tweaking and options
- Not playable at low resolutions
- Translation is decent but needs an editor

战斗模式有点奇怪，回合制下战斗太慢。但是即时制在网格的模式下又很不精准，经常技能放空。而且即时制只能控制主角自己，队友又没有什么AI Focus可以限制一下。此外，战斗中不能切换回合制和即时制，也不能回合制开局布置一下战术，然后用即时制来清扫战场。感觉这个战斗模式有点半吊子。

画面来说，虽然我对像素风一般无感，不过客观来说做的还算可以。模仿了八方旅人那样靠非常现代化的光源设计来让画面有较强的远近对比，总体看上去还算是可以的。就是武功动画的设计，怎么说呢，一点也不武侠，你和我说我在玩最终幻/勇者斗恶龙我也信，基本就是照着早期JRPG的技能动画抄的。

音乐很可以，非常满意。

剧情到目前为止，我只玩了3个小时，就主线来说还是挺有严肃武侠那感觉的。以往的国产武侠游戏，经常喜欢搞些不正经的穿越，以及玩一些莫名奇妙的现代梗，玩着玩着就出戏了。支线到目前为止，感觉是通马桶任务居多，有实际剧情的太少，希望玩到后面能有所改善吧（按照这个趋势估计不会了，一般游戏都把好玩的任务放在游戏开始阶段的）。

总体来说，是个不错的武侠JRPG，放在同类型的游戏里也不错。BUG目前没遇到过，用的键鼠玩的。",1694790226,1694790226,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False
