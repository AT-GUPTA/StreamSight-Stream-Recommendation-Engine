Lets start with the obvious, there is now a fairly detailed character creator which includes the option to play as a female instead. You also get to change a little of your new Yokai demonforms too. While I feel like William didn't add a whole lot to the story in the first game, this does mean that your character is more of a silent protagonist in the cutscenes here, You win some you lose some. I personally still prefer the ability to play as my own gender.

So far my first impressions are that the game definitely re-humbles you. having finished the first game. Some of the basic combat, especially against the more normal human enemies does carry over. But even in the first level there are already brand new enemytypes. It seems from the tutorial that even our familiar foes have learned some new fancy moves. The concept of the Yokai Realm has been expanded from being just the small circles (those do still exist too) into sometimes whole parts of the map where you are under its impact until you clear out a stronger enemy causing it. These areas also lock away treasure chests within the effects range until you cleanse it.

I felt like Nioh 1s weapon selection was already impressive. Now there are several more weapontypes, including the cool combination of a glaive, guillotine and scythe, Switchglaives. Almost all my prior Souls-like experience being Nioh 1, what I found the hardest to get used to in the beginning is the new Burst Counter mechanism for reacting to enemy attacks when you see a flash of red at the exact moment you would take the damage from it. It being a two button input will take some time to become musclememory. But I already feel like its going better for me. This might be even easier for you if you have played other games in the genre with similiar systems in place. 

What was the Living Weapon now is your Guardian Spirit posessing you and turning you into one of different Yokai demonforms. You can still use their skill while in the form as well tho. You can also collect and use new Soul Cores. Which allow you to summon that enemy to perform its skill for you in fights. I can already see myself enjoying collecting these. You can also level their Core up.

The collected Kodamas have now setup a Bazaar where they offer goodies for sale. For example elixirs, talismans or even gear. The currency that they take is the new Divine Rice that they can give in return for your recycled gear/weapons. So you can get something that you do actually want in return eventually. Enemies can also drop it too. This can be a nice way to get your elixirs back before re-challenging bossfights. Which can prove to be an issue in the first game causing you to farm them out.

If you so choose to, you are able to summon an AI ally to help you if you carry enough of the Ochoko Cup item required to do so at one of their blue marked Benevolent Graves. These are left behind by other players using an item called the Righteous Jasper.

You can edit your hut a little bit with inviting a Guardian Spirit over and adding hanging scrolls and tea utensils.

Nioh 2 isn't truly a Souls-like game. It's mostly it's own thing. Don't get me wrong here, there are enemies that can kill you in 1 or 2 hits just like in Dark Souls, Sekiro, Elden Ring and Bloodborne. What sets Nioh 2 apart from the aforementioned Fromsoft games is that the combat has far more to it than them and has a higher skill ceiling, not to mention how much faster the combat in Nioh 2 is by comparison. This game tests the player in many things, such as skill, patience, reflexes, and the overall ability not to smash your keyboard when facing certain bosses like [spoiler] Saito Toshimitsu and Minamoto No Yorimitsu [/spoiler]. When I say this game has a high skill ceiling, I really mean it, it's hard. The game does allow you, if you know what to do, be just as unfair as the enemies you'll run into in the game, as another reviewer pointed out.

I probably don't need to mention this, but the character customization in this game is great. You can customize your character in almost any way you want, even in the most unusual ways like exotic eye, hair and skin colors. In my opinion, Nioh 2 has a better character customization than many of the games that I've seen around on Steam and elsewhere.

As far as the story goes, Nioh 2 has a pretty good story that starts to really make sense after a couple of chapters in. The setting is set in the later parts of the warring states period in Japan, with Nobunaga and Hideyoshi being prominent figures (if I recall correctly, the third of Japan's great unifiers, Toguawa Ieyasu, is only ever referrenced once). I say that the game has a pretty good story only because it can be a little difficult to follow at times, but there are aspects that are phenomenal. I'm not going to bother writing a full review on the story of the game, but there's a point that in my opinion pulls on the heartstrings a little bit, combined with the music really adds to the experience. You'll probably know what I'm talking about if any readers of this review make it that far into the game.

All in all, I'd have to give this game 10/10 despite some of the seemingly unfair aspects of this game, purely because nothing is ever truly impossible to beat. Everything in this game has a gimmick, weakness or pattern that can be exploited. If you can't beat a boss in a side mission, come back to it later when you have unlocked more skills in the skill tree or just being a more skillful gamer in general.

I also wanted to post this review after I both beat the game and hit the 444 hour mark, purely because it's like the East Asian equivalent to 666 here in the west, I thought it'd be funny. Also, yes, it took me [i] nearly that [/i] long to beat this game. I think I was actually done at somewhere around the 400 to 420 hour mark. I spent a lot of time dying and coming back because I'm either a masochist or have some variation of Stockholm syndrome (that last bit is a joke of course, please don't get offended with me for that).",1708409534,1708409534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

More thought went into the core mechanics, making them significantly better feeling and more rewarding to use and unlock.

My only legit gripe with the game is that its still Nioh. The game is incredibly long and gets to that ""i just want to finish this damn game"" feeling near the end.

Pretty much Nioh 1, except it's better in almost every way. Good enough for me to 100% it, which is something I pretty much never do.

Take in mind that despite the common misconception, Nioh isn't much of a ""souls-like"" game. The similarities to the Souls games are surface level, instead it's a mission based fast paced ARPG with Diablo style loot, combos and grinding / loot farming.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
	[*]Amazing combat system with 12 weapon types, each with 3 stances / movesets, their own full skill trees (including both passives and active skills), and additional 3 ranged weapon types, ninjutsu tools and onmyo magic
	[*]Soul core collecting system, where you can loot and equip the soul cores of almost every single Yokai (including bosses) in the game to get passive bonuses and use their unique abilities, basically allowing you to slot in up to 6 active skills to further expand the combat system
	[*]One of the best character editors in video games, with an option to save and share presets with other players
	[*]Two entire coop systems. One that works similarly to the Souls games' spontaneous summoning in case you need help with a specific boss or a tough section of a mission. The second one, Expeditions, allows you to play almost the entire game (excluding few duel side-missions) on coop from start to finish in a group of up to 3 players, with every player being treated equally. Yes, cutscenes and story progression work, no, you don't have to resummon anyone if they die.
	[*]A ton of content across the entire main game plus three major DLCs (included in the PC release) that further extend the story
	[*]Genuinely one of the best NG+ system where each cycle adds new content, mechanics, enemy placements, etc.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
	[*]The game's price was increased noticeably a good while after the release, thanks KOEI
	[*]Uses EOS for the crossplay with Epic Games Store. Thankfully it can be completely disabled in the options menu if you want a stable multiplayer via Steam servers, and no Xi telemetry. That, and also the game is playable offline
	[*]The early game balance is a bit rough, the first 4 or so major bosses and a bunch of yokai can feel a bit spongy, at least until you learn how to melt down their Ki and HP efficiently
	[*]The game actually has a really good enemy variety, but just like the first Nioh it loves to reuse the same enemies over and over again in addition to the new ones, so get used to seeing Gaki jumping at you from progressively more absurd ambush spots
	[*]While the NG+ system is brilliant in terms of the content, it's not so much when it comes to balance. The further you go, the more grindy and min-max'y it gets. If you really like optimizing your build you might enjoy it, but for me it eventually started getting tedious
	[*]Despite the huge improvements, Nioh 2 still retains some of the Nioh 1 BS, which is especially noticeable during the dojo fights against weapon masters (they're hilariously overpowered and cheesy)

Many improvements have been made to the sequel. There are a few new weapons that feel unique. the biggest additions to combat are transformations and special moves, that are really cool. Both compete for the same resource that takes a while to build up. You can only use them rarely so it usually feels exactly like Nioh 1 (which is still the best combat system ever). Nioh 2 does add a lot of enemies and bosses which is fantastic, the multiplayer mechanic is improved and there is a nice npc ally system. 

Both games are a 10/10. Nioh 1 wins mostly for its sale price, it's a very big game for a very low price. if thats not a problem, nioh 2 is just as good to start with. 

The beginning of both games are a bit drab because it has to teach you how to play, and there's a lot to teach. Both games are quite difficult and demanding which might be a deal-breaker depending on your taste. ",1704842414,1708142428,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Amazing gallery of enemies and bosses. You can be punished if you stick to the same strategy/kit against all bosses, forcing you to adapt.

Combat mechanics are deep and complex, and rewards you for actually learning how to play the game. Visuals are beautiful (subjective) and you'll often see bright vibrant colors interspersed in its dark atmospheres, which are immersive and do a great job of giving the player a sense of suspense. I'll be writing a lot more about its combat mechanics as this is where the game shines, in my opinion.

Combat revolves around a core concept called Ki (stamina) management. This might sound strange at first blush, because in other games you'd usually just hang back and allow your stamina to regenerate. In Nioh2 however, there are a couple of passives that return your expended stamina [i]immediately[/i] simply by timing some actions. This means that by mastering this concept, you'll be able to fight non-stop without having much of a downtime, which makes for exhilarating and fast-paced fights. On the flip side, your goal is to reduce your enemy's Ki by breaking their stance and/or keeping the pressure up and preventing them from regenerating Ki:
[list]
  [*]When their Ki reaches zero, they stagger on every hit. This allows you to stunlock them for a period of time
  [*]When their [i]maximum[/i] Ki reaches zero, you get to perform a riposte attack for huge damage
[/list]

There isn't much in terms of similarity when compared to souls or soulslikes. Perfect deflections and iframe rolls are only a small part of the game and are not very effective. The game offers you a lot more ways to dodge attacks like using yokai abilities, yokai shift, or just muscle through with omnyo magic. Positioning is a lot more important and understanding game mechanics will give you more mileage than relying on reflexes. You'll die in 1-2 hits from small mobs no matter how far you are in the story, so you can't grind your way to breeze through the game like in Elden Ring.

I've gone into NG+ after completing the main story a little and I must say that this is one of the best NG+ implementations ever. Instead of just enemies hitting harder, their placement and moveset actually change, which keeps you on your toes. You also unlock higher rarity equipment and other perks in each NG+ cycle. Definitely worth a few playthroughs.

The reason why I'm docking a couple of points and giving it a 8.5/10 is because of fundamental issues that affect looter games and minor technical problems. Turning on vsync in Nvidia control panel causes in-game cinematics to fail due to an encoding issue‚Äîwhich is an amateur mistake imo. The worst problem of all is that there's just too damn much loot. The game drops so much junk I spent perhaps 10% of my game time managing inventory. Bad idea in an action game. 

Despite these issues, I'd still [b]strongly recommend[/b] the game simply because there's nothing like it in the market (aside from Team Ninja games).",1707747976,1707748242,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

 Add in some features that lock you into hell or destroy all your earnings and you find that the developers don't like the players of their games.

 Some features may have been meant to be challenging, but you can't change much after you are locked in.  So you are stuck in something you will need a miracle to beat or you give up everything, and go power level on simple stuff until your cheese is strong enough.

 Some people like it, but this isn't really a challenge, it's just grinding and using the simplest rinse repeat cheese attack.  So many different ""active skills"" to unlock but you probably only need two or three.",1707724299,1707724299,False,4,2,0.487363338470458984,0,True,False,False

This is not Dark Souls. It goes to same school, and wears the same uniform, but it is Not Dark Souls. This game could eat Dark Souls. 
A stellar character creator, diverse skill and weapon selection, extremely fine-tuned build creation, and a cast of interesting characters will be the least of your worries as Nioh 2 grabs you by the ankles and swings you around and slams you into furniture until you come out as the hardest mf alive.
There is no brooding, and there is no depression; only REpression of the enemies that stand in your way. Fight, outdo, counter, defeat, and absorb the power of anything that dares to even so much as wave a threatening object in your direction. You ARE stronger, smarter, better. You are important. You are the Cool Guy/Gal. You are The One.  Do not let even demons deny you this absolute truth. You are Nioh.

The story is fine, nothing special, but it doesn't take itself too seriously with camp and comic relief. The characters also have a lot of personality, but the gameplay is where it really shines.

Featuring mechanically complex combat that requires some time investment to fully understand and operate, but once it clicks, it continues to be one of the most satisfying and expressive gaming experiences around. An infinite amount of possible builds and weapon combinations keeps me coming back every few months to a completely fresh, but equally satisfying experience.

It's a game I consistently feel I'm getting better at, and it feels like there's no upper limit to my understanding of the mechanics. There is very little ""artificial difficulty"" to be found, and almost every death stems from a lack of knowledge or careless mistakes. Enemies always play within the confines of the rules, and things are very well telegraphed through audio and visual cues. There are a couple outlier bosses that just aren't fun to fight (Gyuki, Osakabe), but the game never treats abusing an enemy's AI as the preferred/intended method of ""gitting gud"" just to beat them, and instead allows your mastery over its ki/anima system to string together near infinite combos on a winded enemy.

TL;DR
Complex but fair game, a deep learning experience that continues to reward you with stylish execution and infinite replay value as you learn and improve your understanding of its many moving parts.",1613491700,1706635948,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I absolutely loved this game in terms of character customization, appearance, skills, guardians to pick from and the weapon selections. The game is not easy, but once you get used to the combat style and try out different builds you will end up loving this game. I'm quite surprised that this game doesn't get as much recognition as the Souls games, it is one of the best games I have played to date, I would give it 10/10 rating. What I liked the most about this game was the yokai shifts and the selection of Guardian spirits based on your playstyle. I still remember how much I suffered beating Ren Hayabusa with the middle posture at low level, but when I swapped to low posture I had much easier time. That's when I realized swapping postures in the game was very important. There are so many combinations of builds you can play with! Endgame wise, the game is a bit grindy for the best stats and rolls, but I loved the fact that you can farm gear from actual dead players, aka loot grave system. You wish to reroll the gear, no problem just repeat the stage again, simple as that. I wish Wo Long had this option. With over 250 hours clocked in Nioh 2, I truly enjoyed the game. End game wise, completing all underworld levels and depths is a challenge. My personal opinion Nioh 2 combat system is far superior to Elden Ring. The only nuance in Nioh 2 was the inventory management system, at one point you get so much loot, it's hard to manage it especially if you are grinding for a particular set and stat. I also loved finding the small cute kodama spirits, that was such a nice touch added to the game. 

I truly recommend this game to anyone, regardless if you are not into the Japanese folkore. Even if you don't like katana, the game offers so many different weapons to choose from. You feel like being a ninja, there is a build for that. Do you like buffing the team, there is a build for that as well. You want to go full onmyo magic, there are so many builds for that. Do you feel like being a hybrid, countless of selections as well. Please play the game if you haven't already done so. The game plays well on steam, I haven't had any issues in terms of performance. I have seen some comments dedicated to it, but personally I have never experienced any issues. Co-op is fun too!",1706385706,1706385706,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-half of the game you will spend dealing with your inventory .For some reason they put so much useless stuff in this game is ridiculous .adding more useless stuff when you go to next difficulty 
-  you will get 1-3 shot by every enemy in the game. I could understand bosses do that but not every noob in the game its so stupid sometimes 
- idiotic Ki mechanic . enemies can spam attack after attack without loosing any ki when you will do 1 combo and be empty 

Overall big disappointment. 30% i enjoyed but 70 % was so annoying i honestly dont know i was keep playing

Team Ninja and KOEI have done a fantastic job of portraying all of our favorite historical figures (plus some others that aren't so often portrayed) in a historical fantasy setting that is constantly blurring the line between historical fact, widely accepted folklore, and modern fabrication.  The imagery is dark, and brutal yet also vibrant and full of life.  So, so many things from this game, from core features to one-off lines in the description of something, can be traced to a real life aspect of Japanese history or culture.

Hey there, fellow gamer! Are you ready to embark on a journey where your patience will be tested more than a cat watching a laser pointer? Welcome to Nioh 2, the game that's part history lesson, part demon-slaying, and entirely a test of whether you love yourself.

First off, let's talk story. It's like a sushi roll ‚Äì mostly there to hold everything together. You're this silent, customizable hero, diving into Japan's past to fight alongside and against historical figures. Don't worry if you're not a history buff; the real stars here are the Yokai, who come in more flavors than a Tokyo snack shop.

Now, let's get to the meat and potatoes: the combat. Imagine playing chess, but each piece tries to decapitate you. That's Nioh 2 for you. It's like the game took the Souls-like combat, added a pinch of ninja magic, and then decided to throw in a whole new kitchen sink of weapons and skills. You‚Äôve got nine types of weapons, each with its own PhD-level skill tree. And remember, folks, swinging your sword around like you're trying to swat a fly will just get you killed faster than you can say ""Oh no, not again.""

Here's a tip: dying is part of the journey. You'll die. A lot. But each death is a learning experience ‚Äì like touching a hot stove, but with more demons and less parental guidance.

Graphics and sound? Top-notch. You'll be so immersed in feudal Japan that you might start bowing to your cat. And let‚Äôs not forget the loot ‚Äì you'll find so much gear that it's like playing dress-up with a samurai twist.

So, who should play Nioh 2? Masochists, history enthusiasts, and anyone who thinks they have too much free time. It's a game that will challenge you, frustrate you, and occasionally make you feel like a Yokai-slaying badass.

Overall, Nioh 2 doesn't reinvent the wheel. It just adds spikes and sets it on fire. So grab your katana, take a deep breath, and prepare to shout ‚ÄúJust one more try!‚Äù at 2 AM. Happy gaming!",1704787980,1704787980,True,0,3,0,0,True,False,False

Like riding a quad on a gravel road it can be fun and there's certainly thrills to be had especially with friends but one could not call it polished, well designed, or elegant without an extreme amount of asterisks.

UPDATE reivew on Feb 10 2023 after I beat Elden ring

Elden ring was my second soul game after Nioh 2 and it was pretty good.

Nioh 2 is in away a similar hardcore game like that if there is any other word to describe this genre that I don't know so I'm going to compare this game with Elden Ring since since that game is more popular.

Nioh 2 VS Elden Ring:


_____Pros:____ 

+[u] Better character customization. [/u] I mean like, VERY in-depth. Especially the hairstyle customisation, I've never seen a more complex hair customisation in any game like this before. You can pick a base hairstyle and then there are more sub-customisation for you to adjust from then on. I've had the opportunity to make hair that looks exactly like mine irl ( and along with other badass weeby nerd hairstyles ) and it was so dope.


+[u]Better outfit customization[/u]. Yes. You don't need to wear a certain outfit to have in order to just have better stats. The game let you override any piece of clothing that you want that hence create many several combinations which your character can looks unique to other players while still maintaining the stats that you WANT. Really a BIG FAN of this mechanics whenever it is implemented in a video game.

+[u]Better weapons[/u]. No, I didn't mean to including the combat system. I will talk about it separately.  Nioh 2, when you start the game, there is no class for you to choose. Instead you were introduced with many different weapons types ( including: swords, dual swords, spears, splitstaff, axe, hammers, kusarigamas, odachi, odachis, tonfas, hatchet, switchglaives, fists, 
 and 3 range types of weapon: bows, hand cannons and rilfe ) and actually let you try them all out in the tutorial (you can pick up any other different type and use them at ANY POINT in the game and use them if you change their mind without any draw back). EVERY weapon type has like THEIR OWN different varieties that have DIFFERENT buffs and model designs. ALL of the weapon types are very BALANCED and with different style to uses and you can carry 2 melee weapons for such as a katana and a badass switchblade along with range weapons that can you swap them all out on the go.
+[u]Combat system. Better[/u]. I don't wanna sound like I'm disliking Elden Ring but boy, combat system in Nioh 2 is outnmatched. ( and probably in Nioh too, although I didn't play the first game. I just picked up this one randomly). More in-depth is a understatement. It feels way smoother and more invole than just clicking and hitting button. No. You actually need to PRACTICE with you WEAPONS. Each weapon type has 3 stancesL High, Mid and Low. (for example, High stance means your attacks and combos are more powerful that can breakthrough even a well-guarded enemy but usually will have a slower striking speed that could risk you to be vulnerable for incoming fast attack and cost more stamina to use). That's not all. There are several several combos and skills that you can actually perform at each stance you are on makes it even more dynamic and you can switch stance and combos so FLUIDLY just like in a freaking old kung fu chinese movie.There is also a Ki system which is like the rhythm of your attack. When you swing down a sword, it won't swing back on itself, you have to try to time your attack and press the key at the end of your swing in order to follow up your attacks effectively and blindingly attack your enemies without controlling your Ki (stamina) will usually send you to Jesus more often. A good player is a player who is know how to manage their Ki.

Combining all of these together, we have numerous very deep, unique combat styles and appearances that feels very rewarding for whoever master it.

_____Cons: (kinda, maybe)____


+ [u] NO JUMPING [/u] Only sprinting. But honestly, it's not as bad as it may sound. Because of no jumping, player will have to focus on solving the puzzles, picking their battles and pathway if they want to move forward since there is no cheesy skipping by glitch jumping over the area.

+[u] NO HORSE [/u]. Even though Horse in Elden Ring is not the best video ever that can let you ride a horse but it was still very fun riding it around the map. It also help with the feel of your character, you know, badass sicko mode. Again, in Nioh 2, you don't really need this feature though because it's not an open-world game and this game focus on more every step that you take, every corner that you go to more than running through a grass field with only bushes and trees. Sooooooo, maybe not really a bad thing there is no mount in the game.


+[u] NO OPEN-WORLD MAP [/u]. I'm a big fan of RPG Open-world games. Stalker, Subnautica, GTA 5, Fallout games, No Man's Sky, Don't Starve, Minecraft, Stardew Valley and of course Elden Ring. I wish Nioh was on that list too but this game is actually like a mission to mission type of game. It has a story, not outstanding (more like goofy and with a little bit of cringe sprinkle on top of it) but could be decent if you are interested in Japanese history (or asian culture in general). I didn't understand a lot of things in both Elden Ring and Nioh 2 at first but because I was born in a South-East Asia country so I guess I got used to Nioh 2 faster than in Elden Ring. In my honest opinion, the story in this game is not as deep as Elden Ring but I also think the story in Elden Ring is a little bit overrated ( I know all endings and many secrets and I did some research about the lores)

-A very deep, complex and rewarding combat system. Its almost like dark souls and dmc combined.

-Great boss battles 
-Interesting lore

Cons:
-The performance is all over the place
-Very noticable texture pop in
-Lack of fast travel between checkpoints(though this complaint is subjective since all levels are designed in such a way that you can always create a shortcut to the last checkpoint)
-The level design and atmosphere is nothing special

Conclusion:
Overall, nioh 2 is a great game and an improvement over the first one in every way. The customizability and the deep combat mechanics give this game a lot of replaybility.

I loved Nioh, despite not being good enough to finish it, even after several hundred hours.. And this one seems to continue that, with a new weapon type, or two.. But, theyve added this Burst Counter, and I do NOT like it!  It feels very forced, and overly necessary.. To the point where you will find yourself waiting to use it, because its required. The game was already complex, and this just made it a bit TOO complex, imho.

But its still Nioh, plus some. Expect the same experience, with a little more sprinkles. Absolutely nothing TOO major changed.

You WILL die, because of the camera! Far too many tight corridors, where enemies get you back to a wall or ceiling, and the camera gets pinned to the back of your head, and the monster, blocking ALL vision.

I like that I can summon NPCs to aid in combat encounters, if I wish. I never was able to summon other players in Nioh, and dont plan to use it here either. While I like the help from NPCs, I dont want to have someone else just beat the bosses for me. But I must admit, it feels like some of this may have been designed with coop in mind. Some of these attack patterns are relentless, and dont read very well.

I do not enjoy the boss fights so far.. Something changed when Bloodbourne released, and bosses became too difficult to read.. The first thing you fight in Dark Souls 3 is the same. Its this large thing, and its very difficult to tell where it is safe to move when its screen sized weapon comes at you. Its as big as the length of 3 dodges, and its just too much to avoid. This is when i stopped enjoying these games. Bosses move too fast, and take up too much space, leaving it difficult to know how to even avoid damage.  Nioh had much better bosses, imho.

Bosses have WAY too much HP! If youre using normal weapons, instead of heavy weapons like Odachi or Axe, youll be in the fight for the better part of 10 minutes. With heavy weapons, its MUCH easier.. plus youre not stuck in attack animations like lighter weapons. Some fights feelsl ike you have to have a very specific build to get past. Some of the combos are ridiculous, with far too much reach.

If you get stuck on a boss, theres not a whole lot you can do. Because you will be out of Anima if you use your shapeshift, and no way to recharge it. Likewise with okucho cups, health potions, etc. Everything is finite, and needs to be farmed. If youre stuck, you will just dig a hole deeper by repeated failure. Some builds are just terrible for some bosses. 

Hit boxes are AWFUL! particularly with bosses, and grab attacks. But also some abilities with extreme reach. This community will defend games they like, regardless of poor design or not. And there is poor design here

I dont remember feeling stuck in place when using a Bow in Nioh.. In Nioh 2, you stand in place for a moment, after finishing with your bow.. Your character must stand in place, until the animation of lowering the bow, and putting it away behind your back, finishes playing out, before youre able to move. 

Im finding the light armor basically pointless, as a result of enemy reach/hit detection. Many attacks are difficult to read, or seem as though they reach further than they should. As such, my only way of successful progression, is wearing med/heavy armor, with heavy weapons. Light weapons turn a single bossfight into a 10 minute slog, of slowly chipping away the hp bar. The Odachi still reigns supreme, which sucks, because I really love other weapons like duals, Kusarigama, and others.

Just like nioh 1, its a rare occurrence when you can use your spirit form (Living Weapon in Nioh) The gauge takes so long to fill, that I never even have it available for a boss fight, let alone get to use it throughout the normal gameplay. Its basically just a passive boost for me.

Edit 1: 
This yokai shift, and Demon charge bullshit, is really ruining this game for me.. Theres already SO many combos to remember, you now have to also remember to hit 2 additional buttons in a split second, whenever an enemy flashes red.. Oh, but you have to also time it perfectly!   I want to like the game, but this one demon form crap, and everything tied to it, is absolutely ruining it for me!

Edit 2:
I am now certain of it.. Nioh, is the better of the two. Nioh 2's introduction of the Burst Counter, and Yokai form system, simply turns the game into a panic button mash. Split second decisions will often leave you missclicking, while attempting to do 1of 101 different combinations of buttons, and menu swaps. I do enjoy the build crafting, and gear systems, coupled with amazing combat, but that Yokai crap really does ruin it.. 

What they SHOULD have focused on improving, was the mission selection.. Rather than choosing short maps from a hub world, it would have been nice to remain in one actual sandbox to play in!

Many might disagree, but Team Ninja ruined a golden formula, when they added Yokai form. Im going to leave it as a recommend, but my personal suggestion would be to play Nioh 1, instead of Nioh 2..",1683249843,1703534494,False,0,0,0.266470968723297119,0,True,False,False

Truly feels like it's made by people who play their game.

Definitely not for everyone (in single-player mode). Though if you have patience, decent agility and a tactful approach, you will enjoy the journey! Kinda ""Death from one Blow"" type of thing going for it, though it gives all the tools necessary to progress and counter these situations (Ranged-weapons, Jutsu (tools/magic)).

For people who enjoy 'grinding', randomised item drops, kinda hated it at first but it's really well done, balanced and not a necessity and optional, get decent gear to finish the mission on a simple run, it can help people who have trouble reflex-wise to play, so two for one!

Has multiplayer co-op for 3 (!) for missions from A to Z, though the game transforms more into a beat-em up old-school arcade on main-missions! Also other players can leave their summoning signs as NPC shadows to assist, though limited to only 1.
Also there's the famous uber-cute-demon-cat and these... little green dudes not wearing any pants.

Works well under Linux and Proton by locking to 60FPS.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The combat is different from dark souls entirely while DS1-3 is slower this is designed to be fast paced and more of a dps check throughout the game as the enemies and bosses after a certain point are just about ""how fast can you kill them?"" turns out very fast if you build yourself right. the attacks that the player can use are rather insane though especially those acquired through omnyojin arts or ninjutsu arts as well as the new yokai ability slots that you can use enabling the craziest looking sweeps if you know what your doing or look up a guide yourself it does take time to get there though, but you will if you do the main story and sidequests  all the way up to the DLC and way of the strong unlocks.

the equipment grind is REAL though, i've had to do missions north of 60 times to get the materials for the quality of equipment i wanted but then again my luck is kind of bad.

its not a perfect game but it is fun to me, i reccomend giving it a go... AFTER playing the first one so you can get used to the combat flow.

Then I happened to come across a review on YouTube of Nioh 2 and was intrigued. I was a huge fan of Ninja Gaiden in the Xbox / Xbox 360 era and saw a lot of similarities in combat and style (and the Dragon Ninja skin, the nostalgia is real), obviously being Team Ninja. I've never found a game quite like Ninja Gaiden, and Nioh 2 is NOT quite the same, but it has all the satisfying elements that I loved about those games. Excellent combat mechanics, amazing presentation, and punishing difficulty. I haven't had this much trouble progressing in a game since Alma in Ninja Gaiden Black. But I love it. It's so satisfying to master a weapon and go from getting absolutely annihilated every 3 minutes to absolutely annihilating everything in your path. 

I don't have enough hours in any of the Souls games to really compare them, but this game felt more intuitive to me and I've only consulted walkthroughs and guides on particularly difficult bosses. I've always felt like I was missing out by not playing any Souls-like games for more than an hour or two, and now 45 hours into Nioh 2, I can't get enough. Even after all that time, I've barely scraped the surface of the deep mechanics, enemy types, weapon types, builds, etc. but I don't have that panicky feeling other Soulslike games give me. It's overwhelming, but I find it manageable and while the difficulty curve is quite high, it feels fair. 

I'm a couple years late to the Nioh party, but I'm having a great time with this game and will spend many more hours fighting my way through. Highly recommend if you like punishing games that have lots of variety and loot.",1702313041,1702313041,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most of the community agrees and I as well that this isn't a souls-like. Yes, it is difficult. No, the game doesn't hold your hand. But all in all, its honestly fair and balanced. Plus with how supportive the community is to not only teach people how to play but even assist in build farming, its crazy how much this game went under the radar and still manages to have people still playing it. 

This is a game for those who want a challenge but doesn't get frustrated at dying to a small mob. It will slap you around and it will kick your ass if you mistime your counter, block or movement. Chi Pulses are the name of the game and the skill combos are the bread and butter. Experiment with weapons in your first play through, along with building tank so you can get use to how certain mobs/bosses work. If you are looking to take a slow pace though, I would not recommend the Summon option in the Shrine as most, if not all, people using it are end gamer that speed run the crap out of it. I would recommend using the ""blue"" graves for the extra body and assist as it is AI ran and the same for the ""red"" graves as they drop decent gear if killed (keep in mind that if the enemy does fall off or drown, you will not get any loot). 

I will say, this game does have some REALLY good jump scares as there are mobs at every angle so pay attention and be sure to find a good median between aggressiveness and caution. Lastly, and what matters most, have fun. Don't focus on end game when your playing though, don't worry about builds until you get close to the end and figure out how YOU want to play the game. There is no meta. There are options for everyone out there. Definitely more flexible than Diablo ever was lol.

Pros are:
- Combat is so awesome and has a huge skill ceiling.
- Graphics, lighting, animations, phsyics are all fantastic.
- Storytelling is great, but could have added a few more cut-scenes to flesh out more of the story. Even though it's a prequel to the first game, it actually ties into it quite well and wraps up the overall Nioh storyline.
- Build crafting is endless and so satisfying.

My only con is:
- The character strafing animation is terrible when locked onto an enemy. I can't remember the last time I played a game that had such awful looking strafing animations. PS1/PS2 era? Yeah, it's bad. Bad enough to take you out of the immersion. The first game suffered from this as well, and you would've though they'd have improved it in the sequel. But no, copy/pasted animations. If it had looked better, this game would be flawless for me.

I give this game a 9/10. Great game. If you love Action RPGs with souls-like mechanics, buy it.

Nioh 2 isn't a souls-like, as has been a common misconception since Nioh 1. The most it has in common with Dark Souls is the lock-on, but that's where the similarities begin and end. You don't dodge roll through most attacks, you either block them or don't get hit at all.  This is a high-speed hack and slash with RPG elements and a loot system that gets addicting reaaaaaaaaal fast.

The weapon roster is sublime, with skill trees that actually matter and an endless number of potential builds due to the loot system. Yokai Abilities make you feel like an absolute gigachad, and allow you to dish out just as much bombastic insane damage to the very same enemies who can one-shot you on later difficulties.  Nioh 2 is fair, Nioh 2 is refined, Nioh 2 is one of the best games of its genre.

it perfectly marries the combat of Ninja Gaiden with Diablo's loot system and fantastic implementation of RPG elements.

If you're deciding between Nioh 1/2, I'd recommend 2. Story-wise, it's not important (actually, you might get more enjoyment out of the story if you play 2 first), and gameplay wise Nioh 2 is an overall upgrade.

In my opinion the comabt is one of the best ones I have ever touched.
The story is great, not the best ever but its prertty good
The game and its DLCs is pretty extensive
Visuals are great

It had the fast-paced combat of the first Nioh plus some minor polishing, which makes the combat feel natural; the loot system of something akin to Diablo; the build variety and options that are making me come back and grind to create my ideal build; and finally, the music, graphics, and environmental work are just full-on tongue kiss exquisite. It's like a juicy burger with just the right amount of flavor, and when you bite into it, the burger juice just gushes on your tongue, and it tastes so good, like the best experience I ever had.

So for the combat, it's just the same as the previous Nioh, but with much added QOL changes and some extra spices, which I really like. I've tried and handled all weapons in this game, and the crazy thing is that no matter what two-weapon combination you use, it's all viable. You don't need to worry much about stats and weapon scaling clashing because of the flexibility and complexity of the build system here. Yeah, it can get overwhelming at first since this game's systems are complicated af but if you learn how things work, then you're in for a creamy ride. Enemy variety have also been ramped up with many new enemy types in every mission/region which always keep me on my toes (especially slow down and paralyzing enemies).

As for the loot system, it's still the same RNG-based loot system as in Nioh 1, which is kinda eh, but I understand that the gameplay loop revolves around this, so I just stick with it, and it's not that bad; every now and then you get some crazy loot with amazing stats, which is just dopamine-inducing (I sound like a gambling addict, lol). That aside tho, the main juice here is the newly added boss skills that can drop randomly whenever you kill a boss. All of the boss skills are super cool, and some have even become my favorite skills to use (I'm looking at you, Arc of Chaos and Roar Power).

Now as for the story and mission structure, I very much like it more than in the first Nioh, not because it is something ground-breaking or something, but because it made me feel something human, with the added anime and fantastical twist. Minor spoilers: [spoiler]You are a silent protagonist named Hide, and you joined Tokichiro in his rise to the top of Japan while watching him slowly get more and more insane until it reached the point where you had to stop him.[/spoiler] Now for me, this just oozes anime story telling and I really like what they've done here. The story is told in a 50-year-long sequence, with you doing the main and sub-missions to fill in the story. There are even some two-ending missions where if you do a specific thing, you can get a different ending, get an NPC to partner up with you in another mission, or unlock a new quest line for that NPC near the end of the game, which is really dope and allows for some replayability.

Finally, the music, graphics, and environmental work, like I said at the beginning of this review, are an instant creamy tongue kiss. First, the music is a mix of orchestral band, digital sound and mixing, and traditional Japanese instruments, which came out great and has a lot of impact on how you experience the game. I beg you to let the music and SFX do the work while you're playing this game because not only is it good, but it also amped up my experience of the game. Daddy Magara, the sixth region, and the interim are some of my favorite OSTs in the game. Let's move on to the graphics and environmental work. The graphics are much sharper and have been updated, but they are still in the same style as the first Nioh, which some people might be turned off, but hear me out. The graphics are nothing like God of War 2018, but it still get the job done. The environmental work tho are some of, if not one of, the best fantastical depictions of Japan that I have ever seen in a game in recent years. Unlike the previous Nioh, which had the theme of feudalistic Japan, where you go through castles and caves most of the time. Here in Nioh 2, you go through some amazing and eye-catching maps (like Daigoji Temple, Viper Sanctum, etc.) that will make you stop and breathe in the environment for a moment. It made me remember first visiting Anor Londo in Dark Souls 1, where the scenery is so beautiful that I need a minute to just take it in. The DLC maps, however, have all of the traits that I've described and bring them to 11. All of the DLC, maps, bosses, and music are oozing with anime juice, and I was worried I might be getting anime swag poisoning at this point.

Overall, this game is just amazing and is one of the best ARPGs or ""souls-like"" you can play right now. The price is a little steep for the state of my country's economy (went from P999/P599 to P2333/P1399), but it is worth the money with the amount of replayability and content offered to you. I've experienced some stuttering when first booting the game and also if my graphics driver has just been updated (FPS keeps jumping from 59 to 60), but it's a minor inconvenience that can be fixed. If you want to play co-op, the player base is still mostly alive (mostly on random encounters/summon visitors), but if you want to do expeditions, at least on the PC, then it's hit or miss (I've heard the PS version of the game is still pretty much alive), so I suggest joining the Nioh Discord channel and try asking there if you want to do some expeditions.",1699600394,1699601152,True,40,1,0.760219216346740723,1,True,False,False

This game can feel amazing to play when everything flows well, but things seldom flow well in this game.  As with the first game, it is a delicate dance and high octane bullshit the whole way through, but overstays its welcome by about 60 hours.

At the time of writing, I'm currently in a mandatory boss rush, and hating it so much that I felt the need to vent my frustrations in a review.  This isn't just a one-off bit of passion, though.  I've been welling up my frustration with this game throughout the entirety of this playthrough.

This game for me is an oddity everyone keeps saying it's one of the hardest soulslikes on the market and I just don't see it this game does take a big longer to actually learn the combat but once I've done that I've probably died to one boss more in Elden Ring than this entire game the most I've died to a single boss is 4 times now to clarify every time I play this game no matter what weapons I'm using I use Omnyo and Ninjutsu rather heavily I love the buffing potential of the trees that said they're very overpowered now people could argue that's why I haven't died much and why this game is easy but if you have to intentionally nerf yourself to feel the game's ""True"" difficulty it's not really true difficulty is it? Overall this game never felt difficult really just annoying this game offers significantly more defensive capabilities in it's moment to moment combat so even though enemies are prone to 1 to 2 shot you throughout the entire game even when prioritizing health you have plenty of ways to dodge or block those attacks so it's not much of a problem what this game does do though is heavily rely on gank fights specifically gank fights where there are enemies in melee range trying to attack you sure and can be a problem depending on the weapon you're using the biggest annoyance of all for me in this game is ranged enemies without fail every single combat encounter that's not a boss fight you will find either a yokai or a human constantly shooting at you from on top of a hill or building their overall contribution to the encounter is not danger just distraction it takes 8+ arrows to kill you alot of the time but they do stun you out of literally any attack even with max AA toughness it's not really a problem to deal with these archers but I do find it kind of annoying that instead of just being able to rush into combat and have fun fighting enemies I instead have to slow down and look at the vertical positioning in the level looking for pixels of a enemy hat or glowing shards from a yokai and with how many levels are in this game it gets very old by the time you get to the first NG+ cycle

In terms of a looter game this game is very reminiscent of diablo, grim dawn, or path of exile in terms of it's progression with weapons and armor this game has immense potential as a looter however the first playthrough is the most boring looter I've ever seen literally all the unique feeling weapons in the game are dropped by either the final boss or the bosses you fight after him in the dlcs the gear pacing for a first playthrough is genuinely terrible most times I started a new playthrough in this game I use the same weapon I find in the first few missions until the very end of the game and probably even beyond and while NG+1 is much better it still has an issue where most of the unique passives you can get on a weapon or armor are not available until NG+2 needless to say if you're looking for a looter this game isn't a bad choice but damn you have to push through a slog of uninteresting gear until you get to at LEAST NG+",1697144257,1699078404,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1.) COMBAT feels sooooo goood here, definitely an improvement from the first game. Nioh, at that time, came up with this new gameplay mechanic, that is good, and in Nioh 2 this mechanic is polished, refined. It is so impressive the devs were able to push this mechanic to an even higher level. Definitely one of its kind. A game with stamina limitation, which is applied to your character and enemies, but you are given a way to maintain that in good level so that as I play, I feel this ""limitation"" is not even there (when I play correctly that is). With this I can overwhelm my enemies, making them vulnerable, while I still have the upper hand in combat. This is BIG point that keep me playing.

1.2) This game provide variety of ways for players to approach the game, but CORE gameplay remain the same and ALL needed to play and win this game is to master the CORE gameplay. No need for extra buffs, debuffs, companions or whatever else the game itself provides. They are just here so gameplay may vary for each players and make the game feel fun for a long time. Tips: some part of this CORE gameplay need to be unlocked, it is in Samurai skill tree.

2.) Story is just ""eeehh, good enough"". Mixed between actual history and fantasy, Worse than the story in Nioh. Here your character is just side character, viewing everything from 3rd person perspective.

3.) Replay-bility is not good. Once every mission is cleared, there is no major difference with their higher difficulty. Play once through and done.

Recommended to play. Do not listen or take advice from random players about how to play the game. Any tips that sounds vague, I recommend just do not take them. You can check the stuff in the game. There is a tutorial in the game as well. DO NOT trust other player who thinks this game can only be played if you have the correct setup. They just suck at this game and felt they should compensate it with ""specified"" setup just to make them go easy through the game while what they actually need is just understanding the game's mechanics. This ultimately put the CORE gameplay under the shadow and if YOU play this game like that, you still have not experience what this game have to offer (for Nioh and Nioh 2).

I do not have full achievement completed being displayed because I cleared some of those while offline and Steam does not recognize that.

content-wise this game is really worth the money, gameplay is even better. this game is somehow a great mix between the usual Souls shenanigans with some mechanics taken from Sekiro (the best From game, don't @ me)

the biggest issue seems to stem from balancing problems, mostly regarding some weapon having not as ideal movesets and skills compared to other weapons and 2 somewhat of a dud gimmick boss fight (the only 2 gigantic bosses in the game).

Inventory can also be an annoying problem later down the line.

[b]The game story[/b] is centred around Japan Samurai era & spirits folklore, it's really entertaining with lot of cut scene almost every instanced levels (missions) you clear. These missions are in 2 categories, ""main"" that can be pretty long (30/60min) and sides that are faster (5 min for a boss fight, 15min for a mini level).

[b]The gameplay[/b] is very dynamic and quite unique, this game is close to a soul game with it's own twists.

Every area has shrines as checkpoints and a boss to defeat as ""souls-like"" games have, but the gamestyle is totally Hack and slash element. Also Co-oP works same as ""souls-like"".
The Nioh's beggining is the most frustrating thing in the game, you start with zero combos and skills, your only option to defeat enemies is to pick up a weapon and use 'quick/heavy' attack on the enemy. If you manage to defeat the first area [i](which by the way is way more easier than Nioh 1)[/i] then you'll actually start playing the game.  [b]Weapon Proficiency is key to enjoy the game,[/b] because you start unlocking skills which then you can combine them to achieve high damage combos.
I'm tonfa main, in Nioh 2 i also loved fists and Switchglaive weapons for their variety of combos, they're amazing. You've got variety of weapons and playstyle to choose and every weapon has it's own skills and abilities. Nioh is a gear-level based game so you gotta change your gear a lot especially at the start. If you find any level gear higher than yours it's propably worth equipping it. You can speedrun your areas to the boss or you can farm enemies in order to farm higher lever gear.

I loved the game but it has 3 big thumbs down things for me:
1. NG+2 (Deam of the Demon)
Every mode in Nioh 2 is totally balanced expect NG+2. The boss life difference between NG+1 and NG+2 is the worst unbalanced thing i ever experienced in a game as far as i remember. I was fighting Mezuki with Lvl160+7 Gear and it was the worst unbalanced nightmare. I forced to leave the mission and use the gear i got from NG+2 in order to have a chance.
My point is: [b]NG+1 DOES NOT prepare you for NG+2 at all![/b] The difference is huge, i have played all the way to the ""Dream of the Nioh"" (NG+4) and i haven't meet anything more unbalanced other than NG+1,NG+2 difference. Anyway i believe NG+2 needs a minor nerf on its two starting areas.
2. Character without voice.
Seriously bring back a protagonist with a voice and a desire, i didn't like the story a lot because the protagonist doesn't talk at all. Seriously? You can make a character who can be customized by the player WHO CAN TALK. 
A non-talking character was a dissapointment for me.
3. Guardian Spirits.
I'm a tonfa main player and i love playing with my weapons, in Nioh 1 i could use Guardian Spirits to enchance my weapons so i could extra damage with my combos, in Nioh 2 the guardian spirit ability changes your character's form into Yokai. In General it is not a bad thing because you can deal tons of damage with that form, but it's not my playstyle. I literally entered in Yokai form less than 20 times because i simply hated it. Bring back the old guardian spirits or at least give us a choice on how we wanna use our guarding ability skill, Weapon enchance or Yokai form.

Despite the few negatives, Nioh is a good game, i recommend.",1696969319,1696969319,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

For a  TLDR version this game can be either a 7,5/10 or a 9/10 and that depends on your preferences. To put it simply the game has problems with higher difficulties and scaling. That leads to it changing from a game about a guy slaying demons to a game about farming. If you like a challenge but don't like farming it will be a 7,5/10. If you like a challenge and don't mind farming it will be a 9/10.

Nioh 2 is a prequel-sequel to the original Nioh. You play as a human-yokai hybrid called Hide and participate in the events of the Sengoku Jidai period. At first you start right before Oda Nobunaga's rise to power and eventually conclude the story started in the previous game. You don't need to play Nioh 1 to understand the story. There are some references here and there but nothing substantial 

The game is divided in 10 regions. Every region has it's own set of main and sub missions. Some sub mission can be unlocked after meeting certain criteria. Each mission loads you into a map where you will fight either human or Yokai enemies. Exploring the map will reward you with additional treasure chests, kodamas (every 5 kodamas is a free health elixir at the shrine),  or interacting with Nurikabe yokai guarding a secret passage.  Exploring the map is certainly worth it. For example in the final mission of region 1 you can discover a hidden passage that let's you flank the enemies and destroy a snake statue. It's destruction dispels the dark realm, unlocks a shrine near the boss and drains poisonous water on your path. So careful exploration could be a difference between having a hard fight or a cakewalk. 

Speaking of dark realms this is a new mechanic added in Nioh 2. There are certain areas on the map in which you enter a dark zone. You get a debuff that hinders your stamina (here called KI)  regeneration and to get rid of that you need to hunt the host of the dark realm. The host is a buffed up Yokai enemy. Once you kill him the dark realm disappears, all of the remaining enemies have their ki drained and once killed will not respawn again. Honestly for me it's a mixed mechanic. Once the novelty wore off  it became annoying and before every fight I made sure to use either a spell or a consumable to boost my ki regeneration. 

Enemy variety is excellent. Sure there are some reused or reskinned ones but overall you won't complain about enemy diversity. Human opponents wield different types of weaponry and deal tremendous damage but usually don't have much health.They are also spaced more tightly than Yokai enemies and if you're not careful you can aggro an entire group. Fighting 3+ humans can easily lead to your demise. 

Yokai enemies have a fantastic presentation and a varied move set. They have high poise, deal good damage but have their fair share of weaknesses. All of them won't regenerate stamina/ki. Depleting them out of it will make them stagger on any attack. After a while they will summon a dark puddle that will regenerate their ki and regain their poise. If you completely deplete their ki reserves ( the ki bar becomes smaller after each attack) they will be vulnerable to a grapple attack, (same for human enemies) There are also some enemy specific counters. For example nure onna is a giant big titted snake lady. She is dangerous but her attacks deal almost no ki damage when blocking. The big one eyed oni hits hard but has long recovery windows and his attacks are easy to avoid or burst counter etc. Speaking of which both enemies have special red glowing attacks that deal a lot of damage. You get a move called a burst counter. Basically you change into a yokai and block the attack, denying the damage. There are 3 types of burst counters and each has a different timing to it. For example the phantom burst counter requires you to change right before the hit so it's great to counter attacks with little wind up. 

Of course the game offers you over 45+ bosses to fight. Now in the first game the bosses were for me the low point because they heavily leaned into one shots or cheap attacks. This was partially fixed in Nioh 2. Most of the Yokai bosses are great and fun to fight. During the fight the yokai boss can transport you into a dark realm where he gains enhanced or new attacks and you gain a ki debuff.  Overall this changes the pace and makes more sense than the usual level dark realms. When it comes to human or hybrid bosses I had the opposite feeling. Most of them were annoying and on higher difficulties many of them were obnoxious.  Human bosses don't play by the rules. They deal too much damage, have too high ki regeneration, block too much, have too much health and can do things the player can't replicate. Which leads to most people cheesing them to hell. 

When it comes to character customization this is Nioh 2 biggest strength and weakness. You can create your own protagonist and decide how to build him. There are 11 types of melee weapons and 3 types of ranged weapons There are dozens of armors, many of them being a part of a set, there are 2 accessory slots, skill trees for each weapon, your yokai abilities, samurai skills, 3 fighting styles for each weapon. dozens of guardian spirits that enhance your abilities, dozens of soul cores that grant you special yokai abilities, ninjutsu, magic, special consumables, hundreds of special effects on your items. Add to that new mechanics on each difficulty and you got a product that you can invest hundreds of hours into. Nioh 2 combat is amazing because you can make every weapon and almost every build work. First time I've played a spear and sword heavily armored samurai, Then I respecced into a more agile tonfa and ninjutsu user. After that I wanted to bonk people with my axe and odachi. Each time the experience was different and amazing. Combat is incredibly satisfying. I can comfortably say that Nioh 2 has the best combat from all the souls like games and one the best endgames in the industry. Just type in YT a compilation video and be  astounded of what a truly dedicated player can achieve. 

Unfortunately all of the above is also a negative. Like the first one this game is over bloated with stats, items and has questionable scaling on higher difficulties. I've completed dream of the samurai, then dream of the strong, most of dream of the demon and around half of dream of the wise. After that there was dream of the nioh and the underworld levels. The first two difficulties were fantastic, dream of the demon had me surprised with the increased damage and hp pools but I still managed to beat it. Dream of the wise was honestly annoying. Big hp bars and even the most irrelevant enemy dealt tremendous damage. So to counter that I started farming. Heavily. Better gear, more stats, fishing for better item effects, getting better scrolls and so on. You are constantly under leveled, need more gear, need more resources for tempering it can become overwhelming. The worst part is that you can't craft etheral gear and one item used for tempering weapons is locked behind limited twilight mission or coop.  Why? it ruins the progression and limits the usefulness of crafting and forces you to farm even more. Farming for those isn't made easier by the enemies. They scale better than you and become sponges that hit like a truck. Many bosses have suddenly one shot attacks. human bosses become toxic and you start to question if all of those builds you see online were achieved legitimately.  Every fight is a mixture of buffs, debuffs, consumables or cheese because the game was balanced around having magic and ninjutsu (again). 

In the end I farmed+30 etheral gear and did the final mission on dream of the demon.  For the most time my experience was great but unfortunately by the end I lowered my score for the game to a 7,5/10. For more dedicated players this could be a 9/10.",1696844654,1696845537,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

[u][h3]Pros:[/h3][/u]
-Highly recommended for customization/grind gamers as well as souls fans looking for something a bit faster paced or different. Has a bit of something for everyone that likes ARPGs. An unprecedented yet likely niche marriage of mechanics. 

-Surprisingly full of combos and techs where endgame you may not feel like it's a Souls-like anymore. Low skill floor, insanely high ceiling. You'll find some amazing niche combo/bossing videos.

-Insane yet often times optional gear/crafting endgame and farming, the 3rd person weeb ARPG/Diablo/etc. nobody asked for but deserved. (I've seen people beat while ignoring gearing, or ignore gearing on purpose, but also really OP builds)

-Be a Samurai, Ninja, some weird Monk that spams talismans, or an OP wanderer that does it all. The choice is yours.

-Great copium for boomer Koei/Team Ninja gamers for more stuff involving Ninja Gaiden/DoA/Samurai Warriors characters or gameplay/art. (I like Ninjas and Sengoku Period ok?)

[u][h3]Cons:[/h3][/u]
-As a result of some of the pros mentioned above, the game gets way too dank without some research or prior gaming experience.

-I'm strangely conflicted about the UI being bad because the game has so much depth and was designed for console. As well as with enough hours it just becomes organized chaos, praise be filters and auto-select.

-A lot of people will get filtered before they even get to the good parts. 

-Some mobs/bosses will be a strange difficulty spike for many, but this gets blurry due to the nature of harder games. Depends on the player and how they build their character.

-A lot of these major strengths a lot of people may not see in a first playthrough or treating this like a souls game.

-Insert Negative Review about dying or skill issue.",1696240659,1696241237,True,19,0,0.674091637134552002,0,True,False,False

- The combat system is extremely satisfying and challenging, there is a lot of variety in regards to the weapon types and moves sets that each weapon has.

-Level design is fantastic to say the least, not really a lot too say, its just phenomenal.

I just find it annoying that I have to fight a Boss or Sub-Boss in an area that prevents me from regenerating stamina properly. Honestly its just not a fun way to fight and I think Nioh 1 is better for not having this. 

Another negative is that the sub-missions slow down progression and movement through the story, making you come back and fight old bosses and revisit old places. I just want to go forward, not waste my time going back so often and fighting the same bosses ive already fought!! Its ok now and then but it happens too often. It remind me of DmC4 where the 2nd half of the game is just back tracking. Annoying and boring. If I didnt already complete Nioh 1 before playing Nioh 2 I probs would have just quit this game already around hour 20-30. 

Positives: 
1. Combat system is technical and very good requiring a high level of skill
2. Graphics are good and most people can get a stable 60fps
3. Interesting bosses
4. Replay-ability and about 8 different weapon choices to try out of different NG+ or just new saves. 
5. Ninja Gaiden II meets Dark Souls meets Diablo loot system (tip - just ignore all that isnt purple or above and offer it as a donation for more anima) 
6. More enemies this time. Nioh 1 was very repetitive 


I wanted Nioh 2 to get rid of the 'filler' content which is just the sub missions being so important to the levelling and to be a bit more bold is its level design but imo this is just Nioh 1.5. Not amazing for a sequel but not bad. Just be prepared for some extra time being needed for the sub missions when you might instead just want to progress with the main missions. 

If Nioh 3 is made please fix these issues. Also just get rid of or rework that yokai realm thing its really boring and just makes fights uninteresting. Dont nerf the player for artificial difficulty cause then the game becomes more about running away, or just using the guardian abilities rather and reduces the importance of a players mastery of the combat system",1696026090,1696027661,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The ninjutsu's and magic are super bad as well unless you take the switchglaive, which uses the same stat as magic, or if you follow some guide. i put points into some paralyze cards and had to put ALL my points for my loadout of ninjutsu to get 3 paralyze cards and they dont even do ANYTHING to bosses, if you're lucky it works on small enemies if you hit all 3 cards.

Of course if you ask anyone on the internet for help you get the classic souls-like 2 option answers and nothing hepful in between:
1. git gud haha super funny joke
2. follow a guide
As someone that beat all dark souls games, elden ring and bloodborne without any help from the internet, NIOH just isnt fun for me since if you do some random build with a weapon you'll like, you'll probably find out halfway through the game that your build actually sucks and you have to either summon online players to one shot demon bosses for you or start the game all over again with a different build

Again, most combat is fun and fast and most enemies are fine to deal with
All in all i'd give it a 6/10 but the demon bosses truely seem to be put in the game solely to remind some players that you're not ACTUALLY good, just against 90% of the enemies, and then you hit a solid brick wall that you wont get past, that sucks all the fun out of the game.

The combat is a very polished version of Nioh 1 with added depth, which was already a phenomenal combat system. If you feel like you're tired of playing a dodge simulation, that runs on 0.5x speed, then give this game a try, you won't regret it. If you're a Dark Souls fan, looking for other games in the genre, just know that the combat takes getting used to, it is much faster than Dark Souls, with a more responsive combat system, but once you get used to it, it feels very satisfying to play and succeed with it.

The enemies you fight are very well telegraphed. Every time I died, I knew why and had a basis on which to start thinking how to improve. Never felt like the game is unfair, unlike some other popular games in the genre. Did not need to look up boss tactics at all to figure fights out at all.

If you enjoy following the story and lore of such games, it is easy to follow and prety interesting. You don't have to click on 1000 little notes and items, then figure out the bosses' star signs and then put all that information together in order to have a vague idea of what is going on in the world.

1325200,145879179,76561198065438095,397,7,13108,0,12790,1699293357,"Best combat and builds in a souls-like and it's not even close.

If you are starting the game and have problems, in the first ng cycle is all about learning the game, don't worry about builds or optimising yet, you can reallocate your stats later in the game at laughably low cost and the game gives you gear more powerful (higher level) constantly, so just equip whatever you like trying to stay in the agility you want (<30% equipment weight is A, <70% is B, the better the grade the more distance you dash and the lower your ki consumption, being in C is usually not good). Try to level up everything up, as the stats are there mostly to equip things most of the game, and most builds want 20 or 30 in everything anyway. If you have troubles with yokais (the dudes with purple ki bar), always try to hit the yellow amrita things, it's their weakspot (mostly the head), they'll be stunned and lose a lot of ki, if they are out of ki it's your time to unleash your damage, as they'll be stunned by anything until they recover. Low stance is for dodging, mid stance is for blocking and meh dodging (will do dash into roll), very balanced, and high stance is for damage (and will just roll when trying to dodge). Blocking an attack is almost always better than getting hit, even with low toughness, so just hold block while dodging (beware, normally only mid stance will recover ki while trying to block)

The game can be hard as it's shown to the player like a Devil May Cry game, showing you little by little while increasing the difficulty, as the game has a LOT of mechanics to use to your advantage and rewards aggressive gameplay, where knowing the enemy and the game rewards you a lot. In contrast with other souls combat, here you will mostly try to actually dodge the attack rather than rolling straight to it, because like in Bloodborne you have both a dash with low I-frames but very quick and a roll with high I-frames but slow with high recovery, which is better for dodging big single hits.

The game gets better after every playthrought, if you beat the game you'll want to play NG+, where enemies have new moves and mix the counterable attacks around. Every new cycle unlocks new types of equipment or build-enabling sets, furthering increasing build customisation.

There a LOT of viable, fun and very different builds in this game, from tanks to high dps glass cannons, mages, ranged gameplay that actually feels engaging and powerful, status effect builds, self-inflicted status effect builds, embracing the yokai side and trying to stay in your yokai form as long as possible, unarmed, bomberman, etc. All those and you still have to choose your weapon that changes a lot how you approach the fights, with powerful but slow axe/hammer attacks, to fast and mobile dual swords/tonfas, balanced but technical with sword, maintaining your range advantage with spear, hybrid between melee/ranged with dual hatchets/kusarigama. All weapons have a multitude of skills to unlock and customise, to use in the free-style combat system of this game.",1694125456,1694125456,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Near perfect game if your into Souls like combat.  But this surpasses Souls because you have different choices in your stance high, low of middle.  Which is perfect if your going tom play aggressive or defensive. But Nioh does have it's share of problems, which I'll get to. Back to the good parts of Nioh there are too many weapons to list. This is my favorite game in combat.  And no other games comes close this.  Tons of combat, awesome bosses.  The only weak point in Nioh games is I which there was more enemy types.  But the combat is just so good, it keeps you playing.  My 2nd gripe is the community.  Nioh 2 is just like 1 where the first boss is near impossible.  But when summoning help.  Your help is probaly some kid from a 3rd world country that will just go rouge & you almost never see them.  You just see piles of loot everywhere, with no enemies in sight.  Because they are so over powered & kill everything in a hit.  Whatever happened to working together as a team.  And letting the new player enjoy the game.  So I find myself never almost summoning until & tired of repeating the level for the 20th time.  So then you just summon help & watch them clear everything out.  I just wish there was more balance. Nioh is either so easy it's not funny or it's a complete joke how hard it is.   But it seems like the Devs never learn.  It's all about money.  They even re used a whole level from Nioh 1 & reused enemies.  But for what it is, it still has the best combat & that's worth something.  Just the amount of options in combat.

One mission a specific mini boss ad will be staggered and allow you to spam him when hes out of ki (like its supposed to) and in the next it will just one shot you when he is out of ki (the stamina in this game). This trend of not following patterns also occurs in almost every boss fight. An attack will do a specified thing 15 times and then one time it will not follow the pattern and 1 shot you. The draw of souls like games is that they are challenging but fair and once you understand the move set and pattern then they reward you and you feel like a god slayer. Nioh is not this. So many times they ramp up the difficulty by using gank fights and especially putting in ads in boss fights which is just lazy poor design. The game also struggles from major inconsistencies. One level will be one of the most amazing areas and fights and layout of any game you have ever played and then bam next mission is gank fights and gimmicks. This game also makes the main parry mechanic for monsters a limited item and if you dont watch your amitra then you can perfectly time it but oh, you cant parry because you dont have amitra and forget about parrying when you first load into a mission because you have no amitra. Whoever had the idea to make a parry thats contingent on something other than skill should be fired. You dont unlock the parry for humanoid enemies till at least 50% of the way through the game and if you miss it then you are basically dead. 
Making a game like this thats supposed to be skill based but have it so reliant on level and making parrying the way it is is just bad design. Not to mention side missions are mandatory or you will be so under leveled it will be impossible unlike every souls game where if you are good enough you can beat the game with any build. The leveling system is so convoluted that you HAVE to look up a guide for it. This game has no flexibility in the way you can play it.

Nioh 2 is a worthy sequel to the first game, a game I played a boat load on the PS4 back in the beta. And I was so enthralled by the game, that it was the only game I played for the longest time. This game does everything the first game did but bigger and better.

Creating unique and diverse builds is the biggest strong point, with many different options from using swords, dual swords, kusarigama.. or new weapons like splitstaff and switchglaives, there's something for everyone. Tons of ways to customize your character, including an actual character creation tab. Tons of intricately designed armor pieces and weapons to choose from. By the time you get to the end of the game your samurai will look like a certified badass.

Plenty of replay value, as the game has multiple NG+ you can struggle through. Where you can really start to think about honing your build in Dream of the Strong(NG+)

Nioh 2's combat is indisputably the best in comparison to other ""souls-like"" games. Unique stance based combat, paired with tons of weapon abilities, some for certain stances, combos.. Yokai abilities, burst counters..

If you are a Souls fan then this game isn't for you, it controls more similarly to DMC than any souls game. 
That said I am a self proclaimed master of the souls series having beaten every installment to completion over multiple platforms.

The enemy design is my first main problem with this game, some animations they do are either too fast or too slow, and before the turbo autists get on me for whining about their flawless game I'm not talking about hitboxes I'm talking how good they look and move. I will complain about some enemies being able to do 180 degree turns on attacks with even a little delay, especially when that attack is any kind of leap or jump. 

The game has a system where a boss will flash red and unleash a strong attack, this can be easily compared to sekiro's perilous attack, you perform a specific button combo every time at the right moment and you get a nice bonus.
Burst counters range from consistent and satisfying to confusing and frustrating.  Yatsu no Kami is a boss where I burst counter into the ramming attack (which moves awkwardly slow btw) and nothing will happen. I take no damage and the boss just keeps going. Sometimes delaying the counter too much creates a similar issue where I swear I should have failed but I got to dash into her for free to both no reward and no punishment. On the other hand the first boss Mezuki felt harsh but fair and satisfying when I learned the counter timings and started getting the hang of counters in general.

The weapons look great but the armor is meh to me, a lot of the heavy sets look similar.

Don't buy this game unless it's your specific flavor of over complicated. I've got Yakuza for that.

My final issue is that money is too difficult to come across early game and that the prices for things can become outrageous quickly.

I will be completing this game to get my money's worth.

However, you can become a walking war crime in this game. I mean absolutely overpowered and that's where the game shines. Yet, towards the end of the game the bosses get repetitive, and the ""story"" can leave you scratching your head. The main character just kinda stares and grunts the whole time.

""Nioh 2 has that""

That was nearly every conversation I've had about other games since I got Nioh 2.
It still is.
Nioh 2 does nearly everything, and it does most if not all of it very well.

9/10, maybe 9.5/10
I can't say it's perfect, it has some problems, but it's close.
It's exceptionally good.
It could be considered a masterpiece.

That being said, it's definitely not a game for everybody. It's hard, and it's supposed to be. And every time you conquer one learning curve, there's another one for something else.

I can't really break down the mechanics/features of the game. It's easiest to call it a ""souls-like"" even though that doesn't really do the game justice. When you're first starting the game, ""souls-like"" is probably an accurate tag. 20 hours later, not so much. 100 hours later, not at all, it might more closely resemble something like Devil May Cry meets Diablo.

- Biggest issue is -> Bug involving USB port based system disconnecting middle of fight. Like my mouse what is also way to see things and to attack. In dark soul like game this is few seconds delay equal to death loss of resources.. What i hate.

- Constant spamming of grapble attack and lack of information. Like when is my skill ability to block these possible when its not. Even more if your facing greater level enemy your stuck long time single area of place. Because game deployment maps small sized corridors with contant AoE spam attack. Where enjoyable gameplay comes after you get better items. What is also made tedious... Like why game cannot tell player head on these will be greater enemies. Even later on enemy NPC also start notorious instant cooldown off when attacking to much. Making whole fights more tedious because if you hit more than two hits enemy will counter kill your arse one hit. 

Also in general this game suffers from typical dark soul elements of enemies attacking you thought walls when you cannot attack them. Etc. But that is part of deal...

At first i hated it.  While i love dark souls along the similar games, this one starts out with pretty disappointing gameplay.  Story remains good, theme is good, bosses are good, enemy design is good. 
Just the early combat lacks so many options that it's effectively prodding simulator 2.0. you stab, retreat, stab retreat, stab etc.  Everything is bland and the same with each weapon acting like clones of each other and all equally boring.  So much so that the first time i tried to play this game i lasted 10 minutes in before i found my eyes drifting over to my other monitor playing old TV re-runs and my character standing there still.
The exception being that first fight with the giant club demon right at the start, and the first boss fight with a more complex version of it.

Don't worry, this lasts for about 2-3 hours of gameplay. Maybe more if you are new to these types of games.
What was once a prodding simulator 2.0 now is a good combo type system now that you no longer have effectively 0 stamina. Suddenly now that you can attack more than once, each weapon's moveset now seems unique and brings different benefits to the table. The burst counters now are very useful - maybe too useful but fun to use.  You now aren't running out of arrows every 2 seconds. Armour sets stats and set bonuses now actually do stuff.  Enemies start to show you more complex movesets and yokai become much more common.  Suddenly crafting weapons now serves a purpose (not really the same case with armour until much, much later).  

Mid game which is where i think i'm at is where the game shines. All the gear looks good. especially the master archer armour. the skill board for each weapon type unlocked by ACTUALLY USING THE WEAPON.. such a simple concept but is really effective.. i've started to notice that the points spent in it now have become more impactful and not just additions one would expect as part of the default moveset.

The customisation is nuts, absolutely insane. Also the enemy variety at the point is excellent. there are only 2 of them that i find are a waste of space but the rest actually seem unique and are fun to fight. (Waira and Rokurokubi) Rest are pretty good and you will find you use different parts of your movesets against them quite uniquely which is a massive achievement for a game like this. And with each weapon being unique, this just makes things even more interesting.

When thinking of the customisation in this game, one can think of it like the following for just combat related items... let's treat every system as a value of '2'. most games have; An array of weapons 1*2=2, weapons and armour with different states weights and set bonuses 2*2 = 4, Levelling starts individually to create different specs 4*2=8, unique bosses, enemies and strategies to beat them 8*2=16, skill tree 16*2 = 32, usable items 32*2=64.   

This game takes this baseline then adds different stances 64*2=128, each weapon having its own skill tree 128*2=256, skills our can slot gained from enemies 256*2=512. and so on.
While thinking of it this way has its clear flaws, you get the picture. Every unique system they added interacts with the last adding more than just one interaction, but another node in a giant web that adds more and more complexity exponentially.

I just find the difficulty spike between trash enemies and bosses / mini-bosses is extreme, when I compare to other soulsborne style games. In Nioh 2, I can literally face-roll and insta-kill the normal enemies, but the bosses and mini-bosses are hulking ogres that jump through the air at mach 10 and throw exploding spears at you. Some of the early mission balancing is weird too, apparently I was struggling on missions because I was incredibly under-leveled despite me going at the game's pace. So you are incentivized to replay missions to get up to strength.
It's also a bit of a weird learning curve, since the game feels like you should dodge more than block, but it's the exact opposite.

Still, I'm having fun trying to beat it anyway. I've been wanting something like this for awhile. I really like the extensive talent trees for upgrades, and the opportunities for using several different weapons. Something I dislike about this system though is that to use different weapons effectively, you need to skill into 1 of several different specs. Which leads to a bad build if you want to experiment and have fun with several different weapons, wasting time to level up to make something strong. OR you lock yourself to 2 weapons for the majority of the playthrough. Yes you can respec, but it looks like it's not easy to do early on. 
Luckily, I've been having fun with the hatchets and dual swords, which are both Skill weapons. It's just awkward, it feels restrictive after waving all the options in front of you.

Graphics are decent but not the best.  Where this game really shines is the combat system.  Nioh 2 has one of the most interesting, flexible and well balanced combat systems of any game.  Any character build is viable, depending on your play style.  

There are over a dozen different weapon classes, each with its own move sets in three different stances, making for a much larger number of move sets than most games of this type.  All of the moves for each different combination of weapon category and stance feel very different and support a different style of play.  Add to that different guardian spirits with their own upgrades, complex and highly customizable skill trees and ninjitsu and magic abilities and there is a truly astonishing number of different approaches one can take to each situation, all of which are viable.

The game is quite tough, I am still early on and it is already starting to get quite spicy.  If you like this sort of thing (as I do) then this is a definite plus, however, if you are easily frustrated or do not enjoy very challenging, even masochistic games, then this may not be for you (nothing wrong with that).

The story is minimal but a little more than dark souls games and the lore of the game is actually quite deep, borrowing heavily from elements of traditional Japanese mythology.  There is a lot to explore in terms of setting and lore if you want, though you can just focus on combat if that is your choice.

Personally, I was able to get the veteran skills for all the weapons by endgame. Just make sure you don't throw away your weapon drops of the weapon type you aren't using.

One mistake that a lot of people including me made with nioh 1 was to just play the main missions. This can make the endgame quite difficult because of the steep level requirements. Playing the side missions are really important as it helps to close the level gap. Also, offering weapons and items you dont need to the shrine gets you a lot of amrita for levelling up.

I will say though, managing the gear and items in this game can be frustrating for people starting out. Too many weapon drops and the interface isn't helping much.

That being said, I can gladly recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging combat experience.

The new Yokai zone system or whatever (I played it in Chinese) upped the difficulty for a bit but the parry system also made it easier once you mastered it. I'd say the parry system is the biggest source of satisfaction in this game and requires a bit of training but not as hard as monster hunter series (which also belongs to a nearly different category). You can get 99% of the achievements in the first playthrough but there's only one achievement that you have to get in the 3rd, which also significanly raises the difficulty especially the DLC bosses. It is curious whether Team Ninja can overcome their success of this game since it is ranked one of the best JRPGs on RPG Codex which is a fairly snobby forum, and both Wo Long and FFO felt short to this game's achievements. Has slightly higher requirements than Nioh 1 but worths the upgrade -- which also indicates that their PC port is still poor and likely done by the third party.

Its primary flaws are sadly its strengths though. This game is not accessible in the slightest, it relies on quick reflexes, good timing, and good combat know-how if you want to do well. It becomes even more structured the later into the game you go.

Combat-wise, the game 110% revolves around the premise that is a stance system. Think of any Devil May Cry game where Dante has more than one fighting style. That is exactly how this works, except learning how to fluidly roll between Low/Mid/High stance makes your game astonishingly good. If you can manage to recognize when to be in each stance you will pass most challenges with flying colors.

In this game, your target is not the enemy's health bar; it is the enemy's KI BAR. As difficulty progresses, you will find that more and more your goal is to hit enemies with elements they are weak to, exploit strong techniques, and counter-attack at the correct point to unleash an absolute mess of whoop-ass on an enemy once their stamina runs dry. Always consider that your goal first and foremost. Going a little bit harder on the aggressive side (in a smart way) also allows you to Ki-Break opponents faster leading to openings for criticals and even Zero-Ki punishes.

Build availability is exceptional with almost every single form of build viable and almost every single form of build you can imagine. Do you want to be a dextrous shinobi with the whole utility belt? This is the only game that has a flippin KUSARIGAMA. Do you wanna be just shy of a bandit warlord? Say hello to Axe and laugh as nothing can guard against you. Do you want to be a monk? Fist weapons are absurdly strong. Do you want to be the OG Samurai? The game would love if you did that. Do you want to be a marksman, carefully shooting out opponents one by one and exploiting the creation of gunpowder? You can basically be a ninja-gunslinger (I'm not even kidding, just be mindful the shots aren't rapid fire). Do you want to be a anime magic priest? Onmyo magic. The list is basically unending.

The reason that builds are also so complex is because later in difficulty you'll 100% need to exploit status effects on enemies. If you ever find yourself not doing enough damage, start looking for a status to specialize in. Lots of weapons and items have abilities which increase base attack % (by a good margin) when an enemy is inflicted with certain status. This pairs well when combining status effects as it causes the ""confusion"" debuff which is basically an enemy death sentence.

- A combat system that is challenging but still fun and engaging for player, in short a combat that kick Dark Souls back to chicken coop
- A story that combined historical elements with fantasy, which is serviceable and enjoyable but not very good
- The soundtrack is a Banger, create and amplify the excitement and heroic feeling for player
- One of very few Soul-like games that have good enemy design which is intimidating, challenging yet does not make player vomit

=> Personal: 10/10, can see myself playing this to 300 hrs
     Critical: 7/10: good game, but could make some people feel that the game left something to be desired

*Personal note: IMO this is one of very few games that using a controller and changing its button layout is a must if you don't want to really struggle with the game in the first 20 hours",1648624992,1686837105,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has a lot of ""souls-like"" feeling in it with check points being shrines that reset enemies in the map and allows you to spend Amrita (think of it like souls) on levels, lose Amrita on death and also find them in items to use.

There are so many RPG elements like in depth character creation, skill point distribution, set bonuses, deep abilities tree for each weapon, fighting stances and a viable weapon variety making any weapon fun enough to play. Magic or Ninjutsu abilities can also be unlocked to use along with any weapon, adding more depth to any build. The more skills you unlock more fluid the combat becomes, making it easier for you to just die. Skills can be reset and it's not so expensive to, you can buy the reincarnation books at the blacksmith as soon as you unlock her, with glory as soon as you unlock the glory guy or with those evil Kodamas by giving them whatever, they're all drunk. (I know I kept resetting my build every 3 missions, not cause it was bad or good, just because it was entertaining to try new things).

The action part of the game is really fluid and worth playing, you got evading and parrying mechanics, different fighting stances each one adding more offensive or defensive capabilities to your character and it feels rewarding due to how difficult some parts of the game can be if you are not paying enough attention, actually it feels rewarding even if you are a souls veteran who finished every difficult game you played in the first attempt without dying or using any armor at all simply cause every new unlock is worth. 
As the story progresses enemies get harder and new ones are introduced, keeping your serotonin in check.

The story part of the game was really nice to me with all the Japanese lore and having a character and monsters directory telling more about each character you see in game as well as creature not to mention I felt really feel involved with the game campaign and it feels personal.

Co-op mode is possible although I haven't really tried, but you need an item, which is not hard to get anyway and the system seems to work similarly to Dark Souls co-op mode.

Finishing the game adds a whole new level of difficult and item rarities, so you can just come back for more. Not to mention items with set bonuses tend to become more common as you play more and find more smithing texts and farm revenants and their shady ways to die.

The graphics are a little messy with too much lighting effects but it looks good anyway and it's well optimized (these effects can be set to low on options making the game look cleaner).

Calling it a ""Souls like"" would be only a quarter of the truth and would not give it the justice it deserve.

Yes of course, the game uses element from Dark souls, you have the equivalent of fire (Which in that case are temple), difficulty is here, you have to manage your endurance when attacking, you can summon allies to help you, you have the equivalent of souls to spend to level up, dying will make you loose those souls, and the similarities ends here.

The game does it's own thing for a good portion of the game.
First of all, you don't play on a huge open map, you play on differents mission that occurs on different maps, maps that can have multiple different mission on it, but they are every time a different instance of the map with some minor changes in it or objectives.
There are no intrusive invasion in this game, it instead take a different approach, when other player die, they leave a red mark on your side, and you can summon a bot of the player that died, and fight it to get some loot.

The gameplay is where the difference lies, first, for each melee weapon, you have 3 stances: up which give you the strongest hit, but leav you vulnerable to attacks, medium which is a good balance of attack and defense, and low which give you a lot of mobility to dodge but you do less damages.
There is also game mechanic that allows you to recover Stamina faster once you get the hang of the gameplay, hence rewarding the player for mastering the game.

And all of that, is combined on multiple weapons that will deal differents damages, wether it's more stamina damages, leaving your oponent open to critical strikes, or more health damages.
Also there is a difference with Fast damages that combine well with element you can apply using Magic on your weapon or hard hitting weapons like the axe or the Odachi.

The game also handle the weapon differently.
Instead of your character knowing al the moves on a weapon, you need dto learn special attack by using the designated weapon. For instance, the more you use magic and Katana, the more point you'll get to spend on these element to learn new spell and move for your katana.

The way the game handle the loot is also very different, and this time it's more akin to a Hack and Slash, where you get a ton of equipment with different level of rarity, with different skills, and these weapon can be reduced into component to make other weapon that can be better depending on what component you're using. They can also be tinkered to match more or less your gameplay.
And if you have any doubt of what skill does what to your weapon/armor, there is an in-built help into the game that tells you EVERYTHING.

As for the story, it follow more or less the Japanese Medieval Era story, where you encounter Nobunaga Oda, with a Yoka√Ø and magic twist.

That's this game for you

The combat system works. The enemy design is for a different kind of action game, not for this game per se. If you put those enemies in Sekiro it would be fun. The level design is pointless and confusing. Boss fights feel unplaytested and sometimes unpolished as there would be weird hit boxes that simply don't fit the visual indicators. On the other hand, animations are somehow very polished.

When I somehow beat a boss, I often don't feel as if I achieved something. I often feel that I got lucky.

I kept on playing this game to see if there will be some new sparks. Unfortunately, similar designs just keep showing up levels after levels. I wouldn't say it's a bad game because it has many interesting things going on.

And like in the first game I died a lot.  Death count 592 after I finished it. Not to bad , not to great. But as the game nears its end, I got really good. Last 5 bosses, I died like twice total. 
There is so much to do in this one, I cleaned it 90%, cause you have to get NG++ to clear it 100%. But as much as I hated the game at the moments, at the same time I fell in love with it. The graphics look beautiful , soundtrack is just top notch and it really shines when you fight a boss and start dodging, parrying his moves and kicking his ass. 
I actually love that after a tedious mission you can kind of calm down in the menu, and chill a bit. Selling your gear, leveling up, and buff your character in peace. I got this game on sale for like 20 euros. Best deal I got last year. The game is fantastic. And yes, it is a SOULS like game, but for me, the game is much more dynamic, colourful, hard to master and in its own right, better than any SOULS game I played before. It lacks the open world, but hey, you can`t have it all. Maybe the next one will have something open ""worldish"".

So if you like dying a lot, but enjoying the time you spent getting good, this game is totally for you.

Pro
-Character Creation
-Combat system (different weapons and swapping stances during fights is fun)
-Good story
-enjoyable cutscenes
-lots of loot (despite getting a lot its easy to manage compared to some games)
-Very fun skill trees
-leveling system is satisfying
-Mission selection makes it easy to come back to and remembering your spot if you haven't played for awhile.
-single player co-op and dedicated co-op are both options.  Need help with a boss summon a random?  Want to set up a lobby with up to two friends you can do that too.
-tutorial area is available if needed and not forced
-User friendly Armor/weapon customization for appearance. 
-Boss fights have good mechanics

FPS is up to 120, unlike Nioh 1 which is only 60 on my end. No Vsync. I can see some visual tearing during cutscenes, even with Radeon Enhanced Sync turned on. The game is more annoying than Nioh 1 because of Dark Realms, where enemies are stronger and faster, and ki regen is slower. But it becomes manageable as I progress. It features Yokai Shift which I think is very OP, can deplete most of bosses HP if I can manage to grapple them twice. The game also has the Counter feature to counter enemy Critical attacks, supposed to avoid taking heavy damage. But the game does not want me to use it. If I do, I will find out that Critical attacks are just too fast to be countered or cannot be countered at all without taking any damage.

Only those with a penchant for utter dedication and a distinct aversion to daylight need apply. Prepare to witness the unparalleled virtuosity of my gaming prowess as I regale you with tales of my epic triumphs and make you question your own pitiful existence in the gaming realm.

Let's start with the skill factor, shall we? Nioh 2 is not for the faint of heart or the feeble-fingered casuals. No, my friends, this is a game that demands the utmost precision, reflexes sharper than a samurai's blade, and a mind as disciplined as a Zen master's. If you dare to step into this hallowed realm, be prepared to invest countless hours honing your skills and sacrificing all semblance of a social life, for mediocrity will be swiftly punished.

But fear not, for within this brutal crucible lies the opportunity for true greatness. As I, the one true gaming prodigy, effortlessly parried, dodged, and unleashed devastating combos upon my foes, I basked in the radiant glow of my unrivaled mastery. My victories were a symphony of pixelated perfection, leaving lesser mortals in awe and admiration. Oh, how I reveled in the knowledge that they would never reach my exalted heights.

Nioh 2, you see, is the realm of the elite‚Äîthe playground for those who scoff at hand-holding tutorials and laugh in the face of scripted narratives. The rewards it bestows upon the chosen few who persevere are as exquisite as a finely crafted katana. Each boss defeated, each seemingly insurmountable obstacle overcome, fuels an insatiable hunger for more. The sense of accomplishment one feels upon mastering the game's complex combat mechanics is akin to sipping the finest vintage wine, only to have it stolen from the plebeian masses.

And what of the commoners, those poor souls who dare not tread where I have trodden? They may tremble before the unyielding difficulty, their hands blistered, their spirits crushed. But for those who embrace the challenge, who yearn for the taste of true victory, Nioh 2 is a revelation. It is an opportunity to transcend the mundanity of everyday life and ascend to the realm of the gaming gods, where legends are born and lesser beings tremble in awe.

So, dear readers, I implore you to embark upon this perilous journey, if only to catch a fleeting glimpse of the greatness that eludes you. Shed your mortal shackles and embrace the mantle of the elite. Only then, through hours of toil and a mountain of broken controllers, will you understand the true essence of Nioh 2‚Äîthe intoxicating elixir of skill, perseverance, and insufferable superiority.

It isn't a Souls-like, claiming it is a Souls-like it equivalent to claiming Pokemon is a Souls-like because your Pokemon gain experience and improve their stats by leveling. Or claiming it is a Monster Hunter-like because it has action combat. It absolutely has Monster Hunter and Souls-like blood in there, but neither is remotely accurate.

It's a mission/stage based action RPG with INTENSELY deep stats, gear, and general mechanics and gameplay with a staggering amount of room for player expression in their gameplay style. If you beat the story, you have not beaten the game, in fact, the first 5 ""New Game +"" difficulties are all basically just a tutorial for the real game, The Abyss. There are people that aren't even aware that once you've hit the maximum number of stats that can be allocated at level 750, there is an entire additional leveling system AFTER that with different stats you can put point into.

The multiplayer options are 2: Summoning Co-Op, where while you are in a level you can summon either a rando or a friend to come into the level and help. This mode functions like the singleplayer mode and if you die you get sent back to the last shrine you were at and your cooperator is sent home. If they die, you need to go resummon them. The scaling in this mode, and ever enemy layout and types are different than the other MP mode using the Torii Gate.

Torii Gate MP is a different type of gameplay. In this mode you have a bar that depletes if any of the players go down and it drains until they are aided by another player or the player opts to just deplete the bar a set amount and get up on their own. If the bar bottoms out, you lose. Unless you're in a boss fight, if it bottoms out in a boss fight, it simply means that those who are dead cannot be revived and it is up to the surviving players to either beat the boss without going down anymore or fail. Like I said earlier, this mode's enemy types and layouts in missions can range from slightly different to quite a bit different, and the scaling on the enemy HP, damage, and Ki are different than both solo and summon Co-Op. This mode is much, much, harder in many respects than either of the other 2 gameplay options and both requires more game knowledge to do well, but unfortunately it can be ""unfair"" due to how difficult or even at certain point impossible it is to flinch or stagger enemies or bosses, who in solo or summon co-op you could stunlock but you cannot in Torii Gate co-op. It's certainly an anti-cheese measure and mostly just makes the game tougher, but on rare occasion, it CAN feel a little bad if you are used to stunning/staggering certain enemies and now you cannot.

It might be a bit simple minded but in my opinion Dark Souls does not let me have that kind of fun. The save points before bosses being way farther away than they should be at times, combat feels slow at times, and other issues make retrying challenging parts frustrating. This is something I never get from Nioh.
As a spiritual successor to the Ninja Gaiden series, the game features a freedom of expression in combat that I really have not seen in many games. There are a dozen weapon types to choose from, and you may use two of them at the same time. Keep in mind to get good at a single weapon you might need to spend a playthrough or two just using that weapon. Add in the new systems introduced in Nioh 2 like burst counters, yokai abilities and yokai shifting and the complexity only grows.
Yet in the midst of the complexity, Nioh feels suprisingly simple once you get the hang of it. Unlike dark souls, that in my opinion only starts being fun when you are mildly ok at the game, there is constantly something fun to discover in Nioh 2's combat regardless of skill level.
Every boss in this game can be beaten in either preferred playstyles, weather that be knowledge of weaknesses you may exploit, through the challenge of learning to evade and perfectly block the enemies you fight, or sheer style once you get good at the game. Its a gift that keeps on giving.
I also want to spend a moment to talk about the level design. While it lacks the metroidvania feel of the world of a souls game, Nioh 2 accomplishes that same kind of level design that I loved in Dishonored 2. Almost every main story level feels memorable for one reason or another while still keeping the focus on its primary gameplay loop. 
While I would say the game is overall easier than the original Nioh there is still plenty of challange to be found, especially in the postgame that also taps into a lot of the looter-shooter/diablo-esque focus on getting and upgrading new items.
Enemy design is extremely varied. There are a lot of unique enemies to be found, with variants that are not just cheap recolors but have new unique moves, forcing you to pay attention what you really are fighting.

In the end the core of what I wanted to get across with this review is that if you liked Dark Souls, you may not necessarily like Nioh. Comparisons are great and all, but Nioh is trying to do it's own thing and it does it damn well. However, I would also say the inverse is true: If you did not like the Dark Souls series you may end up still really liking Nioh; Especially this second game. Or maybe end up like me and love both of the series and have a jolly good time kicking down gods and demons alike.",1682976552,1682976552,True,2,0,0.52413475513458252,0,True,False,False

Many mention a lack of difficulty escalation. Which is true for the first playthrough, but it's a combat game designed around repetition. The difficulty begins to scale dramatically after NG+3 and you have to really interact with the building system.

Gravity and water are the most lethal enemies, truth

The game's optimisation sucks, truth

The game is not what I would call a Soulslike unless the criteria is losing progress on death, and having checkpoints. There's no world building or hub, you just select missions from a menu.

Some of the best combat of any game released. Not sure I would compare it to Fromsoft though. Sekiro has similarities with its posture system and rewarding a faster pace of gameplay, but is a much purer experience - and in Fromsoft style, is much less frenetic. I'd tentatively draw a comparison to a roguelike like Risk of Rain 2. Both have breakneck speed and punishing gameplay, weapons in Nioh can be compared to survivor classes, both restrict your access to all of the combat behind replaying/unlocks. Nioh does incorporate procedural generation in the end-game, albeit not very well, although I can forgive that as reaching that point will still give ~200 hours of gameplay.


The game's true flaw isn't the story - as you many note, the missions serve to deliver you the excellent combat experience - but the level design. The level design is not good and this actively harms the gameplay experience.",1613236957,1682968990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

End game thus becomes meta min maxing. Every thing is a grind, soul cores are grind, levels are grind, gears are grind.

Don't mind the hours, my actual play time is probably half of what's recorded. I afk a lot while I work and just leave this game up.

I'm 3/4ths done with dream of the wise and I don't think this game is for me:
1. story is a hodge podge of oh no, ancient evil corrupted this historical figure to explain something so shallow even if it absolutely makes no sense.
2. I absolutely detest RNG mechanics, and I detest it more when it is RNG built upon RNG. This game is that mechanic raised exponentially.
3. Even if the RNG mechanics was toned down, the builds aren't even interesting to begin with, some stats are absolute trash until you stat stack them to make a crazy build. The game absolutely choked the fun gameplay at the very end of the game (probably 1000 hours in) where absolutely vital stats likes extended dodge invulnerability/ extended dodge distance / mystic dyads and the ethereal graces / ultimate stats make the game actually fun
4. The higher difficulties are absolutely cheap. They just make enemies be absolutely tanky for no reason and dish out 1 hit kills in return, give them cursed buffs that make them even worse.

I really wished this game's developer has gone a different direction with my above complaints, but I don't think they'd take a random complainer seriously.

verdict:
a writen review cant express the frutration i got from this game so for some perspective:
i played LOL for years and never got more than a bit annoyed. nioh 2, on the other hand had me in fits of rage wishing the dev's horrible fates. ithought i was imune to game- induced rage after playing different mobas unscathed. oh boy was I proven wrong.
i have such a sour taste from this game that not only do i advise against buying it, i will never buy a ninja games studio game.

This is an incredibly fun game that will absolutely seem cheap and unfair for the first 10-20 hrs. or so, but if you stick with it, you'll find a game with more diverse build options, deeper combat, and more replay value than anything else on the market it could be compared to. The way it plays is unlike anything else, and(if you're a Souls vet in particular)some of the new habits you'll have to pick up will take a bit to stick. The amount of systems, commands, and equipment choices available to you at any one point can easily overwhelm.

...and that's a good thing.

The fast-paced nature of the combat, coupled with timing juggling stance changes to restore your stamina to the highest possible point mid-combo and being mindful of opportunities to neutralize enemy attacks via the Yokai transformation system, contribute to one of the most engaging second-to-second gameplay loops I've ever encountered. The cash and prizes you get when wrecking an opponent is a nice audio/visual bonus that, if you really get into tweaking and optimizing your equipment, just makes everything even crazier, once you get into stuff like debuffs and support skills. I can't stress enough how insane this game becomes at higher levels of play; the stamina meter, for instance, changes from a resource to be carefully guarded into an active buff dispenser, boosting attack strength, stamina restoration speed, and/or canceling stamina loss for blocks/dodges if you time stance changes well as you attack. each weapon has it's own skill tree, with stance-specific skills and attacks further augmenting how you play. None of the weapons are objectively bad. Everything is good if you just dig deep enough.

This game goes from unfair to seeming completely broken with the aid of some light reading and basic middle-school math, and that's great; the game rewards your knowledge of it's systems with fun.

I'm too busy making fools explode w/well-timed high-stance Odachi swings and scooping up their belongings to pay attention to things like the story or character motivations, so if you care about things like that, I suggest something more like Dear Esther or Gone Home, this might not be your jam.

TL;DR: An ultra-difficult mix of Ninja Gaiden+Diablo 3 w/Souls EXP-loss-on-death mechanics; you might not like it if you don't like fussing over numbers and items in your inventory, but if that doesn't bother you(or, like me, you live for that)then it's perfect ADHD dopamine fuel, would recommend, 10/10",1682005171,1682005171,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All in all to simplify what Nioh is and if you'd like it just ask yourself these questions: Do you like Japanese History? Do you like Japanese stories? Do you like Japanese monsters A.K.A ""Yokai?"", And do you like fun immersive combat RPG systems? If yes to any of those then you'll Love Nioh 2, and if no to all those that doesn't mean you won't love the game still. Just means you won't enjoy it to the same depths as people who do love those things.

In conclusion I'll spare you of the details, plot, mechanics, and anything the game entails. Because that's long and is irrelevant in regards to whether the games good or not, because it is simply a great game. But I will tell you that if you do love Japanese history, their monsters, and their historical classes such as Omyoji (Mage), Priestess (Female Mage), Shinobi (Ninja), Kunoichi (Female Ninja), and Samurai (Warrior) then you'll find this game extremely fun! Those are the three main builds but there's so many weapons and styles that you can be creative and make countless different builds and play styles that the fun and creativity are endless. All in all its a fantastic game that I have 600 hours of playtime and I'll continue to add to that number because this game is timeless and is still fun many years later, so if anything I mentioned remotely interests you like Japanese history, Samurai's, Japanese mages, ninjas, fun/cool combat, RPG's, spirits, monsters, demons, and things of these natures then you'll find yourself loving this game.

This is the only Action RPG with a combat system on par with Fighting Games like Tekken/Guilty Gear and Character Action Games like Ninja Gaiden/Devil May Cry. I would recommend new players to start here rather than with the first one. As it turns out, Nioh 1 is a more difficult game. This one is a prequel of sorts so it is not only more accessible but also functions as a standalone title in terms of story. Unlike Dark Souls, this is a mission-based Action RPG but it does follow the Dark Souls formula of level design in terms of exploring a legacy dungeon with multiple routes, checkpoints, and the ability to unlock paths back to checkpoints as you progress. You level up your character as you defeat enemies and increase stats of your choice while also unlocking new moves/abilities for each of your weapons, magic, and Ninja techniques. However the combat system here is the main appeal. There are multiple different weapon types with three different stances/movesets per each that can be changed on the fly during combat and each stance for each weapon has their own special moves which can ALL be customized and given customized boosts (like poison, fire, extra damage, stamina recovery, etc).

And... that's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of combat complexity. There are light/heavy attacks with combo finishers, parries, grapples, burst counters, transforming into a demon, magic spells, buffs/debuffs, projectiles, sheathed weapon attacks, directional input commands, dodge attacks, timing related abilities to recover stamina during or mid-combo, custom demon attacks to choose from, and that's just the basics. It does get more advanced than that as well but you get the point. This game is very technical and that's what it makes it so good. So, you love the complexity of combat in Devil May Cry but you also love the exploration of legacy dungeons in Dark Souls? Then this is the game for you. 

That being said this game is a much faster pace than Dark Souls and rewards offensive combo-oriented play like in Devil May Cry so the challenge and skill ceiling are both higher. If you pick up this game and end up losing over and over again to a boss... you can summon a visitor to help you and/or just wait for the boss to glow red and use the Bust Counter. Begin your combo once they are out of Stamina (Ki). This is the secret of Nioh 2 that lets you cheese bosses. Burst Counter did not exist in Nioh 1 and is the main reason I say that Nioh 1 is a more difficult game. This game does require some practice and patience. Although it is a faster pace than Dark Souls, you shouldn't ever be button-mashing. Instead you should be mixing up your combos and looking SSStylish.",1681749223,1681749223,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For those who don't know what kind of game this is, it is a mix between Ninja Gaiden, Diablo and a little bit of souls like elements. You navigate through missions and defeat very challenging enemies and bosses. 

As for the PC version I think it is alright. There are parts in the game that stutter no matter what you do, such as the cave area in The Hidden Monsters of Okehazama, but these stutters aren't very frequent. Controller support seems to be functional I didn't have any issues. The game technically supports UW but only 3440x1440p. FWS does have a Nioh 2 plug in and I think it works fairly well.

If you're looking for more intricate combat with a great amount of depth and variety this game absolutely delivers if you have the patience to learn it. It's worth it to look up some guides for the combat and level progression probably as with any Souls-like, but once you learn it all it can feel really bad-ass. You can always do co-op or summon npc's to make it easier too, but I really enjoyed the mastery I felt from solo-ing the game.

I found the aesthetic and setting to be a lot of fun too. Admittedly the story and characters are nothing too special but they're still fun and not detractors I'd say.

The world probably won't be as satisfying to explore as any FromSoft game and the game uses a mission structure that re-uses maps, but I found the levels/scenarios well-designed and still good.

The number 1 thing that stands out is of course the combat. Nioh 2 has the the richest, deepest, and most satisfying combat system I've ever experienced. Customising your build and your experience is an absolute joy and I found myself learning more and more about the game every day. Tonnes of weapons and playstyles means that there's something for everyone. If you have ever played Monster Hunter or Bloodborne and thought that the weapons were cool but needed more depth than look no further. Please watch some combo videos online and you'll get a taste for it.
Of course there are other things to praise Nioh 2 for. The loot system is fun and feels rewarding. Seeing numbers go up never gets old.
If you're into Japanese history it's fun recognising famous historical figures and events.
The enemy design is great and varied.
The level design is pretty good for the most part, which is a big step up from Nioh 1.
The game also felt easier, both to understand and progress, compared to Nioh 1. 
The Yokai shift and abilities are extremely fun. I wish more games let you use enemy and boss moves. 
The postgame design is fantastic. There are several new game plus cycles, and not only are they very fast to get through, they all change up how the game is played, whether it's through adding new loot rarities, adding new mechanics like cursed enemies, changing the enemy placements and giving them new moves, increasing the level and stat caps, or adding a new ultra massive dungeon for hardcore players.
There's even more to praise, like going over the combat alone would take an entire thesis with how much depth it has, but I'll leave it there.

It has some of the same flaws as Nioh 1, but overall it was a great sequel that improved on the solid foundation of its predecessor. If you're on the fence, I'd say give it a try. Go in with zero expectations, a lot of patience, and a willingness to learn and play by Nioh's rules. It's punishing, more so than any of the Souls games in my opinion (probably including Sekiro, though Sekiro's bosses are usually harder; Demon's Souls also might be a bit more cruel), but it can be a blast to master its combat.

If you get to the third boss ([spoiler]bastard snake[/spoiler]) and want to delete the game, don't. I was ready to start cheating, but then I beat it. The rest of the game felt so much easier after that.

[b]Pros[/b]
-GOOD HAIR OPTIONS, so basically a 10/10
-Great character creator
-Lots of build variation
-Good fashion (transmog!!)
-Photo mode
-A few pretty good bosses (that I'll remember fondly; the bosses I remember from Nioh 1 were the ones that drove me insane)
-It's just kinda cool--the armor, movesets, weapons, grapple animations, yokai forms/shifts; it all makes you feel pretty awesome (the animation team went berserk)
-Solid enough story (though its not always told as well as it could be)
-Fantastic and complex combat system; the stances are still one of my favorite things ever
-Quality of life improvements, like if you died to a boss, your spirit/amrita return automatically when you enter the boss room again (please do this Miyazaki)
-Some of the active skills are sick; one of the odachi ones is busted, you can cheese a lot of human bosses with it, and there's this funny one with axes where you can throw people like 10 feet away.
-The new game plus modes actually change things, and you can switch between NG and all of the NG+ modes whenever you want
-Didn't make me as angry as Nioh 1 for some reason

[b]Cons[/b]
-Reuses overused enemies including some from the first game
-Repetitive levels filled with enemies that may or may not fit in
-Bosses are hit or miss; a few are really fun as I said, but most are forgettable, and some feel clunky and poorly designed
-Around halfway through, you've seen most of what the game has to offer in terms of level design, loot, and enemy design (at least in NG); it's pretty much the same gameplay loop in similar levels with the same enemies
-Have to grind side missions to stay at the recommended level (I beat Nioh 1 about 20 to 40 levels under and did fine, so maybe that works here too)
-Just about every enemy from the giant monkeys down to the little goblin bastards can one or two hit you at some point in the game if they really feel like it (depending on your build)

I think Nioh 2 is best played at a slow pace. It may not be a relaxing game, but if you go in relaxed and saunter through Sengoku Japan only a few steps at a time, the repetitiveness won't bother you as much, and you might have more fun.

Overall, I've been loving Nioh 2, especially in the lategame, and I think it's worth your patience.",1668286547,1680817820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
1.  Great character customization.  I hate ugly characters, it would be hard for you to make a crappy character.  Also you can adjust your character's looks anytime
2.  Non stop action.  Great combat mechanics of high med low stances combined with a vast variety of weapons that fit your play style.
3.  Lots of build to try.  Means more fun.
4.  Yokai abilities are awesome, lots of Yokai to try.  Some are pretty OP
5.  Use jutsu, yokai abilities and melee seamlessly
6.  Despite my long list of gripes below, the combat mechanics is what kept me playing.

Cons:
1. Lots and lots of reused stage/enemies from Nioh 1.  Made it feel like I got ripped off that this was nioh 1 extended.  Yes the time period of the 2 games link but you shouldn't have to reuse.  Poor excuse, just laziness. 
2. Movements that look good but don't make any sense and it will annoy you.  Enemies can dodge your attacks... but this isn't the problem... it's how they do it... for example an Yoki who literally is 3x your size would ""dodge"" by side stepping just a foot to one side which visually is still within your weapon's range but magically your weapons will pass thru their bodies... Cast sloth(slow) on them and watch even funnier animations. The same exact movements can be seen in Nioh 1... which means devs just reused lazy design.  Turned me off cuz I thought it was a bug in Nioh 1 and its still here. Not a game breaker but I can't stand how it looks.
3.  Ridiculous tracking.  Results in some very funny animations.  For example:  the very first sub boss you will face, when it whacks you downwards, you dodge to the side but the attack follows... defies the laws of physics... apply sloth for again a funnier animation.  It will literally follow you while already in downward motion even as you spin around the enemy... not a game breaker but funny and annoying when you get hit with something that doesn't make sense.
4. Human enemies poorly programmed.. devs made them just spam atks, no regards to ki management... devs don't seem to know how to make them hard to beat by their own rules so they resorted to breaking their own rules.  Funny thing is when these human npcs become your ally in missions they fight like crap.
5.  Weapon specific Dojo missions.  if there was one thing I learned from Dojo missions is that Dojo missions dont teach u anything u can actually use in the game.  U literally have to spam just a few attacks to beat these ""masters"" that again don't play by the rules you are suppose to play by. And these fights last very long since u only do so less damage. 
6.  Inventory management is a pain.  Most drops are garbage... and there are lots of them.  u gotta know how to use filter in your inventory... otherwise you spend so much time on it
7.  Underground I believe was a DLC, I was excited that it was 100s of floors only to find that the floors will repeat... again reused maps and stuff.  Almost exact enemy layout.  Didn't even feel there was any variance in difficulty as you repeat each of the same floor layout.

Control:
The controller is chaotic and I seem to fight with as much as I fight the enemies in this game about 60% fighting enemies and 40% fighting the controller (And 100% fighting the CAMERA all the time). Stupid lock-on system (why press the right analog-stick to lock on? Why can't it be holding down one of the shoulder buttons). Block/Dodge on LB but burst counter RT+B is a very annoying setup especially in clutch moments. Finishing down/winded enemies and back stab don't work a good number of times (perform strong attack instead). Weird i-frames inconsistency.

Enemies: Yoki, Enki, Yamanba, Nure-Onna, Ubume and Magatsu are the most well-designed enemies. The rest are either subpar or downright BS (like Karasu Tengu, Aberrant Soldiers and Tesso). Karasu Tengu, after a while is easy, Tesso is still BS even after you beat like 50 of them, Aberrant Soldiers...

Inconsistent bosses/sub-bosses difficulties:
TIP: Equip Yatsu-no-Kami or Magatsu Warrior Soul Core once you get it, they'll cheese the hell out of most bosses.
Here're my scores:
(Boss: W/L)
Gozuki: 14/39 (1st 'boss', but very fun to fight, probably 30 deaths come from Lv1)
Mezuki: 12/10 (If you beat Gozuki, Mezuki is ok at best, best Soul Core in the early game imo)
Enenra: 2/5 (Boring boss, too slow, small range, predictable pattern. Won on first try, the other 4 times is on The Golden Castle mission bc I messed around with weird strat)
Yatsu-no-Kami: 39/14 (F this boss, but top-tier Soul Core, imagine being so annoying, its soul core annoys other bosses) (yes, I farmed this boss for soul core, lol)
Kamaitachi: 1/2 (what the hell is this boss? The stage is annoyingly confusing but the but this boss is pathetic)
Tatarimokke: 1/10 (Fighting this boss is 25% the actual boss and 75% the CAMERA)
Gyuki: 1/10 (Same as Tatarimokke but WORSE, CAMERA in this fight is messed up, DON'T USE LOCK ON on this boss, you'll just ask for troubles.)
Kasha: 2/1 (Great design, too easy)
Ryomen Sukuna: 4/2 (Boring...)
Daibara Bocchi: 1/9 (Very easy once you notice the blind spots, and run instead of dodge, bring Kasha with Life Drain and throw it onto the hands, it'll fully heal you every time, cheeseboss)
Shuten Doji: 1/3 (Fun Fight but Too Easy)
Osakabe-hime: 1/24 (This boss is fair, the Camera here works ok when you lock on but they couldn't figure out for Tatarimokke and Gyuki???)
Otakemaru: 4/16 (Fight is fun until you realise this boss is easier than Osakabe, yeah... will definitely fight this guy more if his stage wasn't designed by a complete moron.)
Uminyudo: 1/8 (big form has the annoying laser, small form redeems the fight, fast and fun)

Humanoid bosses:
Saito Yoshitatsu: Ok fight, if you like fighting yourself.
Imagawa Yoshimoto: Too much fun, great music (until they reuse the same music for other bosses like Mataza)
Magara Naotaka: Don't remember this guy exists
Azai Nagamasa: Too.easy. Considered this guy is AFTER Yoshitatsu (how is that possible?)
Gamo Ujisato: What a whim.
Honda Tadakatsu: This guy is easier than Mataza, Saito Yoshitatsu, Saito Yoshimitsu and Nobunaga, let that sink in. I use him to farm Amrita.
Nobunaga: Fun until you realise you can cheese him with Sword Ki and Iai Quickdraw.
Mataza: Fun, but the bridge curve can screw up certain attacks.
Saito Yoshimitsu: Too fast, too furious, a lot of fun then I wonder why can't every single humanoid boss be like this? This guy is vicious, but that's how it's supposed to be.
Shibata Katsuie: Cheap boss. Equip Yatsu-no-Kami soul core and cheese him with sword Ki.
Saika Magoichi: Another boss that makes you realise that's how every humanoid boss fight should be: go fast, small opening, short but crazy fights.
Maeda Keiji: 3 tries, fair
William: Go back to retirement please, what a joke.
Benkei: Cheap as hell but fun and ideal boss fight: fast, strong, small opening. This guy just has too much range.
Tokichiro: Ok, he carries the about-average story of this game but is he even a boss??? He's easier than all of the humanoid bosses above (except William, Gamo Ujisato and Azai Nagamasa)

Companions: Just use them as fodders and let them die before you fight anything. They're stupid, useless and sometimes causes enemies attack offscreen to hit you).

Music: only Imagawa Yoshimoto's boss fight's music is worth anything. I often just go fight him or Mataza for the music instead).

Environment: Bland design, nothing special, (Except Viper's Pit and The Golden Castle, those 2 have characteristics). And are you telling Japanese can't swim??? Immediately die by falling into 2m of water is BS)",1680792926,1680792926,False,0,1,0.38348880410194397,0,True,False,False

If you are like me and love Souls like games then you definitely heard about this game. I was excited for another action combat rpg. That was until I got to play it.

This games combat is by far the worst part of the game. It really is just janky. The button maping makes no sense. Why are the dodge button and the interrupt dodge attack different buttons? What I mean is for me, you have dodge as X and during boss red eye attacks you have to push R2 + O. Why not R2 + X? Best part is that for most other action rpgs, your dodge button is never X. It's usually O or a trigger button.

So you hear this and think, why not just change dodge to O? Because you can't. The one button you would want to change your dodge to as it makes the most sense, cannot be changed. You cannot change O to any other command other than ""interact"". This is just plain stupid.

Okay enough about the controller. How about the actual game? The ""combat"" is rigid and feels not complete. Your attack combos feel rough. Not being able to cancel an enemy from attacking you by dodging makes no sense. You HAVE to block if you are getting hit. You cannot choose block or dodge. The single worst part of combat is your ""ki/stamina"". Needing to push R1 after every single combo you do or you run out of stamina is bad gameplay. If you are mid combo attacking and you get hit or need to block means you cannot push R1 to recover your stamina. So that means you are now stamina starved and will get hit. This whole system feels like you are being punished for trying to weave in attacks and blocks. It feels bad to run out of stamina because the enemy forces you into a defensive position. I believe this is meant to slow combat down so you cannot just R1 spam to victory. But instead it breaks the tension a boss fight gives. Ruining the whole experience.

Overall, this is a bad way to do action combat and this team should look more into why games like Darksouls are praised for their combat.",1680684472,1680684472,False,2,0,0.354219019412994385,0,True,False,False

Not to brag, but I consider myself quite good at a variety of games.
I am used to bad hitboxes, stupid amounts of damage, and excessive tracking, as I have played and succeeded at games like the Souls series (and multiple games from that genera), witcher 3 on death march, and the Monster Hunter series going as far back as Freedom Unite.
I play and enjoy a variety of difficult platformers and persevere through every challenge presented.
The point of all that is to establish my history, I know how difficult games work and am willing to put up with annoying mechanics...
This has to be one of the worst Souls-like games I have ever had the displeasure of playing.
To be completely honest with my experience, I never made it past the first horse demon.
I like to have a challenge, so when presented with one I'll work my hardest to overcome it.
The tracking and damage on such a large foe is completely absurd, small enemies should move fast and larger enemies should move slower with both having fair amounts of damage.
As I was still in the early game I'll disregard the stupid amount of damage he did and focus on the excessive tracking.
Damage doesn't matter if you don't get hit, but the bullshit tracking makes that almost impossible.
He will track the player up to the very last moment of his strike, sometimes spinning on a dime to do so, you can't fake him out, you can't dodge a millisecond too early, and the sheer size of the weapon means you can't get out of range.
It looks so incredibly stupid to see this giant enemy spin on a top to reach you, or to jerk this massive club in the complete opposite direction it was going just to kill the player.
And that's what this game wants to do, kill you at any cost.
I wasted almost three hours of my precious life fighting this same enemy and came to the conclusion that the game wasn't for me. 
The game looks good, but that is where the praise ends.
Not being allowed to swap the dodge button on a fucking PC is shit.
Having to take ones eyes off the enemy to manage a stamina recovery mini-game is shit.
Being stun-locked by a large, fast, hard hitting enemy isn't fun... it's shit.
What a waste of my fucking time and money, I could have saved up a bit more and gotten something more worth my time than Nioh 2 like sekiro, Elden Ring, MH rise, tetris, pong, or any of the resident evil series (even the bad ones).

Unfortunately for me where this game started to really shine and things really clicked was towards the end like, how to properly grind, abilities, and much much more.  I say unfortunately because frankly, Nioh 2 demands your time to get the best out of it and I just don't have time to play with so many other things coming out, my backlog, and limited time in general.

The combat is fun as heck - Maybe the best in the genre.
- The weapons feel different enough where everyone can find a weapon for themselves and the skilltrees allow you to 
  personalise your weapon-choice like no other game in this genre.
- A good system to support the melee gamplay (Magic and Ninjutsu).
- The best system for equiptment weight (could use some more ingame stat-explanations tho)(looking at you toughness)
- A great gearing system - A lot of differnt stats allow you even more freedom and it just feels good to see yourself progress up the quality levels.
- The Bosses are overall mostly challenging yet can all be overcome with few tries and getting to know them.
   None of them feel like an extreme Wall
- The normal Enemies are different enough that if you get to a new area you can fight new stuff evertime.
- The leveldesign is really fantastic. Many Maps loop around and you get to find shortcuts that actually get you where you need to go faster.

-
The structure of the overworld.
- Some ppl may disagree but I prefer the way others in this genre give you a more cohesive feeling world.
  With the Ability to go wherever you want.
  Nioh 2 just hast pre built levels (very lovingly created mind you) so the world feels more split and
  the story doesn't have the same feeling of being one singular world, but only multiple stages to play through.


In the end I can say I enjoyed this game alot.
I've finished every mission on the standard difficulty and can say it was worth every minute I played.
The price is imo fantastic.

It's brutal, it's unfair, it's grindy, its frustrating but it's too well-made for me to thumbs down it.  Despite many technical advances, I don't actually like this game I'm writing this review to give myself the excuse to just quit and go play something that I'm enjoy.

Up-front, Nioh 2 does ALOT right. Nearly all of the systems found in the original game have been vastly improved and the gameplay is much smoother. Nioh 1 required a college degree to understand, but Nioh 2 is a full-blown PHD program in itself. New tagline: ""Prepare to Google."" 

I considered the customization, skill trees, ninjutsu and magic systems of the original game to be some of the best I've ever seen in a souls-like. Nioh 2 takes it much further and allows an insane amount of freedom in creating your character even in the base game. More importantly, skill points are gained by using them and this means that you can constantly switch up your tactics without handicapping yourself. (Note to Nioh 1 Players: You don't unlock magic/ninja through the story... you start with them and need to gain a skill point using items.)

The new additions to the gameplay are ""Soul Cores"" (Abilities dropped from enemies), Yokai-Shift (A needed nerf to the living weapon), ""Dark Realms"" that drain your ki and can't be purified except by killing a boss, and ""Soul Parries"" used to deflect specific powerful attacks. Despite a absolutely non-nonsensical control scheme, these systems all feel like natural progression of Nioh 1 and add to the experience.

So why do I hate this game? 

Nioh 1 first-playthrough was a pretty standard action game. It shipped with a single NG+ and it wasn't until DLC and updates that Team Ninja nailed the grind-game. For the base game? You get meaningful rewards like Smithing Sets for completing missions so that you can create the gear wanted as you play through the main game.

Nioh 2 was built for the grind you found in Post-Game Nioh. Smithing Sets have become a <1% rare drop item from bosses, reduced experience and money payouts, skills are tied to usage, soul cores need to be fed other souls ala mobile games. You can ABSOLUTELY win without the grind, but you're at the mercy of the RNG to drop gear you actually want. 

I feel like I'm playing Dark Souls version of Destiny. 

In addition to the grind, much of the balance was restructured to feel more ""Balanced"". 
- Base damage is MUCH lower. You generally take two to three hits to kill instead of one and normal enemies now take much much more. 
- Finishing blows that used to deal 30-50% health now deal 5-15%. This turns alot of bosses into endurance marathons. 
- Bosses all summon Dark Zones that immediately refill their ki and slow down your attacks until 30+ seconds pass or your break them again.  This doesnt make things harder or more interesting, only slower.
- Percentages were greatly reduced or Where Nioh 1 would offer a ""+9% Amrita gain"" Nioh 2 would instead add ""+0.7% Amrita gain"" or maybe ""+7% Amrita Gain While Health < 30%"".
- Where Nioh 1 every enemy had exploitable frames you could strike to break their ki and stun them, Nioh 2 has exploitable breakable parts or exploit frames that might deal a % of ki damage that don't stun them and can be shrugged off when a boss summons their dark realm. 

This ""Balanced"" gameplay just makes everything take longer. 90% of the challenge in Nioh 2 is just staying alive long enough to chip away at the bosses health. You make one mistake and you'll get caught in an unblockable combo and be forced to start over.

Bosses are probably the single most important part of a souls-like and it's a mixed bag for me. With the exception of a few gimmick bosses that were borderline garbage, most have been enjoyable. They are far more dynamic than the bosses in the first game. More moves, multiple variations for each combo, and some pretty interesting timings.

I usually really enjoyed the bosses for the first few minutes of a combat, but after the fourth time its fully regen'd its ki without changing up its move set... I just stop caring. There's JUST enough jank that a bosses cheap shot will stun-lock you to death to cross to frustrate me. 

I really haven't felt that ""Overcame the challenge"" joy you get from these games when I win... but instead end each fight with a final ""F you"" to the devs.  

Nioh 2 is an extremely well-made game and obviously it has its fanbase. If you like to ""Git Gud"" and grind for rare loot drops, this is genuinely an amazing game. I'll probably still beat it, but I don't see myself thinking fondly on these hours.",1679871328,1679871328,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For example the cons that aren't as good as wo long are the character customization, you have way less options making me feel less motivated to creating unique and awesome cosplay characters. Then youre merely thrusted into the tutorial instead of being put into a well made cutscene or backstory or summary of the first game so the game just suddenly happens and the cutscene that does play just means little to nothing in comparison to story when looking at nioh 1 or wo long which had a far better introduction. The floaty movement compared with the utter stiff camera really didnt match well and i constantly felt like i was walking on skates. The hud is simply too congested and it made it feel more of a mmo than a soulslike. The combat was decent but felt so sponge like and yes like a mmo again, you do so little damage in the beginning it felt like every enemy was a boss battle and hardly fun at all. The systems of regarding ki pulse is completely annoying and just there to make a hard game just frustrating even more with the insane stamina consumption i would find myself throwing one attack just to have to fall back for 5 minutes and wait for stamina to regen. Yes the ki pulse allows you to regen stamina faster but its useless because by the time you do ki pulse the enemy is already attacking you so you have to fall back anyways. The stances merely was to just make a complicated game more so and made it feel like there was merely no purpose into making a stance system worthwhile besides the massive amount of time spent just looking at a skill tree full of moves i felt personally could've been done way better by just making it a single skill tree for the entire weapon youre using. The damage output on enemies is so heavily insane that if i got caught once id be dead, boom, everything gone because i got hit once. I know this game is suppose to be hard but thats worse than dark souls is and dark souls almost never made it to market originally. The graphics arent as good as wo long either, i would constantly catch very blurry textures compared to 4k textures that made it look odd and weird as if they lost budget making a sword look good and instead put all their money on face textures. Omoyo cups are insanely grindy to get and the coop system is timed, so if i was surrounded by enemies the npc could just leave at any moment thus making my cup farming useless. The story isn't as good as either nioh 1 or wo long either, its paired with 2 second cutscenes and then boom youre in a random area with no build up unlike nioh 1 or wo long where it followed the character to that specific area. The only thing good about this game is the fashion, it has a lot of armor options but whats the point in that either when you cant make a good character either? Ultimately id think this game would be average but in the end its slightly below because of my tastes and its systems being poorly done. PS - For those are constantly reply to this review who insult me saying that i have no clue what im talking about and quote ''my inability to understand the game'' clearly never read my review stating that ive already beaten the game before, matter of fact ive beaten the game twice already. Its not my lack of understanding or anything of the sort because like i said ive beaten the game before so clearly i know how the game works. This review (like all reviews) are subjective to my own experience and within comparison to the new game ''Wo Long'', if you dont like my opinion then you may simply not read this because this is for the new people who hasnt played the series yet and may consider getting either nioh or wo long. 4/Cat Clock",1679607188,1679776150,False,3,3,0.343139171600341797,0,True,False,False

ok, story: people say it is non-existent. this stems from comparing it to nioh 1 imo and that means folks are not paying attention. it is not S tier or even A tier but there is a story about sustaining one's self fully and wholly. killing the trash within. obvi it's all revolving around tokichiro's warring conquest. yet there is DOPE energetic motifs and symbolism. tangible if you look hard enough.

combat: um, this is the entire foundation when it comes to Y this game rules. ki (stamina) management is impecable. the ki management system is an internal ""combat system"" of itself. it flows from within with ki, outward with stances, and into action with combos & movement. it's so slick. it is glossy without any gunk. SWIFT. brooding when learning, as it should be?? super fun. 

replayability: anything is replayable, but i'll specify how this REALLY is. up.. it's deep, engaging, endless possibilities. to explain it would be spoilers and yadda yadda shit you only get if you try. it's very abyssal. much to do. i guess mentioning that there is magic, ninja stuff, yokai shifling abilities, and   a lot of weapons with loads of movesets and combos to master... yeah that is good enough for this section.

numerical score objectively: 8/10 .. on PC there is some jank, and overall i think nioh 2 is vauge in some descriptions which knocks off a little polish, but from me, an objective 8/10 is massive. input drops on D pad happen sometimes. whatever.

numerical score IMO: 15/10 .. it's fucking fun as shit. there is just so much when it comes to subtle themes and aesthetics & mechanics and depth. nuff said.

Reasons why this is NOT a soulslike: everything else

Jokes aside, do not expect to play like souls, combat's entirely different, do not expect exploration or deep lore, game's not about that, main point is fights and levels are there only to create different situations / ambushes

Story is fine, not bad, not excellent, NG (New Game, first playthrough cycle) is only the tutorial of the game, pretty much the presentation of the different enemies you can find in the game for you to fight during the 4 other game cycles, floors of the underworld and underworld depths, each cycle adding not only higher stats, but also new mechanics to enemies, swap places on the map, change enemy types, but also giving you more tools and more customization options for your build, such as higher tier gear, ultimate stats (perks you obtain for completing special missions AND having reached 150 of a specific stat), and set bonuses we call graces

Combat is the absolute best I've ever played, but be warned, it's not beginner friendly, and while one can develop insane technique and land stylish combos, it won't really ""click"" for most players during first playthrough, for 2 reasons: they'll be busy learning mechanics, and they don't k now the enemies, expertise comes once at the higher cycles, stamina management is key, don't like the ""spam dodge and wait for your turn"" type of combat that souls brings to the table? NEITHER DOES NIOH, and so you can endlessly combo if you're skilled enough, not gonna go into much detail because I could be here typing for days, but as absolute essentials, enemies have stamina too, out of stamina enemies = stagger with each hit / open for grapples, there's this mechanic called ki pulse (ki is the nioh version of stamina), which lets you recover part of the ki you just used on a combo, with a catch, ammount recovered depends on your timing when you perform it, too soon and you recover less ki, too late and you lose the pulse window and so you need to wait for passive ki recovery to do its job, get hit by an enemy and ki pulse window vanishes AND you receive ki damage, more advanced techniques let you recover even more ki, which is the actual ""endless combo"" part

Customization is a blast, not only can you customize your character appearance, core stats and weapons but you can also pick many skills and passives to learn for your weapons, some having the same key shortcuts, having to decide whicih one to slot in for your style, additionally, there's 2 root skill trees (shiftling and samurai) which not only provide utility and upgrades to your character, but also unlock special effects for your active skills (that you can customize, so you can have any active weapon skill imbue lightning if you use lightning arcana, although you can only have each skill effect once per weapon) if anything, the biggest downside to this much customization is probably the high ammount of RNG there is for gear / soul core drops, but that's not really a problem until Dream of the Demon / NG+2. There's also ninutsu and omnyo magic skill trees, which you can use with any weapon although they do scale with specific stats, still bring great utility to any build

The game also brings in decent coop in the form of expeditions, 2 or 3 players challenge a level together (don't need to have already completed it but think you do need to have unlocked it) levels change slightly by adding more / tougher enemies, there's a ""help bar"" which depletes as members die, if it reaches 0 you can continue for less rewards or you can restart, there's another mode, random encounters, which works more similar to souls coop, except you call for help from the shrine (bonfire / checkpoint) by using consumables, up to 2 visitors can be summoned, and they step into your game as it is, do advise heavily AGAINST summoning help, not being elitist, the downside to random encounters is that you don't have a say on who comes to help (you can set it to friends only or password but no filter for random players), and there is no cap on who can come, so you could summon someone from NG+4 at max lvl with min max gear and get your experience ruined because they're one shotting everything

TLDR
pros: AMAZING-COMBAT, post game and customization, actually good coop mode (expeditions)
cons: MMO-like RNG for higher game cycles, random encounters not limited by player state of game",1679430948,1679430990,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I hated it because it was incredibly frustrating to get obliterated for making one little mistake. I uninstalled this game numerous times, only to reinstall a week later and repeat the process. 
But eventually... It clicked. And when it did, it clicked HARD. Now, this is one of my favorite games of all time. Maybe even my favorite.

The replayability of this game is insane for having no actual pvp. The amount of unique playstyles and skills you can get, add onto that a really cool NG+ experience, you've got a game you can play for hundreds of hours. There are content creators on youtube who have a decently sized following just playing this game. Mind you, no PvP.

This game has a skill ceiling that is soaring in the sky. It will annoy you when you first start, you might feel like the game is clunky or that you don't have enough Ki (stamina) to do anything meaningful. Some of that is due to the fact that you're a low level, but one of the key components in this is to swap between stances and regain your Ki so you can continue your attacks and flow between them. One of the best first skills for your ""samurai"" tree should be the one where you gain a bonus to your Ki gain when timing a ki pulse with a stance swap. That will become muscle memory for you and that's where your flow will really shine. 

Not much else I can think of to say, this isn't a review of pros and cons, it's just me giving you a taste of what your experience might be like if you're brand new to this series. Get into the Nioh community and you won't regret it. Watch some people play the game on YouTube who are just flexing their skills if you feel like you've hit that massive wall. Get inspired.

you can dodge or intercept them gw demon core (move set, for my understanding) .

PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS MUCH FOG IN NIOH 3 PLEASE STOP WITH THE FOG! 

I'd recommend looking up Clearly or Fog begone, if the ""greyness/graininess"" caused by the fog is hurting your eyes or enjoyment of the game.

Nioh 2 confuses larger health bars and poor stamina for difficulty. Nioh 2 is a grind fest, not a ""Skill fest"" though it is still fun despite having to get decently leveled equipment to make any progress at a decent pace. I'd say the dark souls series is far more skill and knowledge based while Nioh 2 is far more level and equipment based. Nioh 2 often just throws an unfair amount of enemies at you or just plainly makes it like you are using the equivalent of a wet noodle against steel.

Personally I prefer the first Nioh game since you can combo certain kusarigama moves together that can no longer be comboed in the second, the sound effects IMO were better, and I liked the living weapons better since they were cool and didn't make you ugly, and I liked the story better.

Also the game looks really grainy because of the fog that makes it so ugly, & so hurtful to the eyes.

But nioh 2 has full character customization (Excluding the ugly super form where all you can change is the hair) and is more of the same but with some fancy new stuff like the yokai abilities which are neat.

Personally I liked Nioh 1 better, but the enhancements in 2 are nice, and endgame combat looks really cool, but sorta takes forever to get to.",1643515083,1678492387,True,1,0,0.466299384832382202,0,True,False,False

The game is hard and full of walls, but for every extreme difficulty that the developers expect to crush you, there are a multitude of strategies that turn you into a wrecking ball. Encounter wall? Learn how to smash it. The Snake Boss is weak to Fire, and combining Fire with Purity grants Confusion, which lets you deal Double Damage and prevents it from gaining stamina. That's strategy one, and there are better ones for every boss. You don't even have to be perfect, you just have to know what you want to do and do it Hard. 

It's an amazing game, and runs great (now).

The character progression/customization is off the charts. It‚Äôs not overly complicated once you get the hang of it but still has an impressive amount of min maxing potential in late game. 

Comparable to the souls series, at first glance the mechanics are very similar although I would argue this game is less clunky in its movement and combat. You will still get overpowered by certain enemies but like the old saying this time it actually is a skill issue. 

Level design is more based on a linear platform design rather than like the souls games where it‚Äôs more open letting you explore for hours. Once you‚Äôve played it long enough though it doesn‚Äôt really feel like a con as it fits better in the faster pace of Nioh. 

The loot is more Diablo based in the sense that the gear drops are in multiples from any given enemy as well as affixes/colored tiers on weapons, gear and items.

Each weapon type has a skill tree that you can progress through by killing enemies. You gain skill points based on what weapons you choose to use, along with magic spells and ninjitsu.

Like souls series, there is a NG+ except for Nioh, the game changes entirely in level design after your first playthrough. It really incentivizes players to continue to play after the first time beating it.

Co-op in this game is legit and straight to the point, you can join up with your friends and play almost all of the levels(some story missions are private). When a buddy goes down you can revive him given there‚Äôs a team health bar that can run out causing everyone to fail the mission, although it can be replenished while playing together. 

Player blood pools are in the form of Revenants, shows how a player died but also will allow you to summon that dead player to a duel where if you win, you have a chance to get their actual equipped gear they had on when they died, players use this to give out gear too. 

All in all pretty amazing game for $40

From the moment I started playing, I was immersed in a world full of demons, magic, and epic battles. But what really stood out to me was the intricate and deep combat system that kept me engaged for hours on end.

At its core, Nioh 2 is a hack-and-slash game, but the combat goes far beyond mindless button-mashing. Each weapon type has its own moveset and playstyle, with different combos and special attacks that can be chained together for devastating results. And with the ability to switch between two different weapons on the fly, players have an incredible amount of versatility and strategy at their fingertips.

But the combat doesn't stop there. Nioh 2 also features a complex system of stances and Ki management, which add layers of depth to every encounter. Players must constantly monitor their Ki (stamina) levels, using Ki pulses to recover and keep the momentum going. And with the ability to switch between high, mid, and low stances on the fly, each attack and dodge becomes a strategic decision.

What's truly remarkable about Nioh 2's combat system is how it rewards experimentation and mastery. With so many options and techniques available, players can find their own unique playstyle and develop new strategies as they progress through the game. And with multiple difficulty levels and a New Game+ mode, there's always a new challenge waiting for those who want to test their skills even further.

But Nioh 2 isn't just a game for combat enthusiasts. The story is engaging but could have been crafted better, taking players on a journey through feudal Japan filled with mythological creatures and political intrigue. And with a cast of interesting characters and a deep lore to discover, there's always something new to uncover.

All in all, Nioh 2 is an exceptional game that deserves to be enshrined in gaming history!",1678211470,1678211470,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lets talk about the pros:
1. the game runs flawlessly. From what I have heard the devs prioritized performance over graphics, and it shows in game. the game looks decent, but it runs so well.
2. the combat. Easily the best thing about this game. It is extremely good, as you can unlock moves and customize your moveset, stance swap combos, practically have unlimited stamina if you get the ki pulses down, have multiple systems at place and can pull some montages on the same level of blistering eye candy like devil may cry 5 combo videos. 
3. the cultural aspect of it. This game is historical fiction, therefore a large part of the cast are historical figures or extremely faithful adaptations of japanese mythology, which means that if you have relative knowledge of japanese history it is very interesting to see the game bring up these legends and stories into its world.

Now lets talk about the cons.
1. the artistic vision can be hit or miss. A lot of things like enemy design can be some of the best I have seen considering the mythological aspect of it, but the weapons, armor and a lot of characters just feel like those shitty chinese RPGs that over design their characters with little thought behind it aside from ""it looks cool"".
2. shitty story. The story of the game is only there to be an excuse for you to go fight things with the insane combat system, unremarkable in every way aside from the historical ties I discussed before.
3. mission based structure and uninteresting level design. The way that this game uses mission based levels, while serviceable, makes the game feel disconnected and cripples your immersion from if they have an interconnected world like souls games do. the level design is subpar, gets the job done and nothing else.
4. loot hell. Easily the worst thing about this game. there is so much loot, and to properly optimize your character you need to minmax down to the random attributes of each weapon. your storage space is also limited, which means at some point you have to sit down properly gauge what you want to keep and what to discard, which is not fun at all.
5. mediocre boss design. ever wondered why people dont fanboy over any nioh bosses the same way they would fanboy over Artorias, Ludwig, Isshin or Gael? yeah. Pretty much all human bosses are bad. Yokai bosses can be decent, but overall forgettable at best. They can be very hard tho, since most can 2 shot you, and their hp bar is massive
6.the terrible balancing in terms of difficulty progression. a Team Ninja classic, nothing strange here. the more you play the game the easier it gets, as they slap 15 different mechanics on you the first level and expects you to have relative mastery of it 10 mins later.
7.the game feels kinda cheap. Flashy colors, floaty animations, enough visual clutter to delete an epileptic person and obscure what the hell you are trying to see, makes for a game that feels cheaper than it should be.",1677987891,1677987891,False,5,1,0.484090268611907959,0,True,False,False

Also didn't help that the story (specially the last DLC and the last region), felt very rushed, it's not really a problem if you've played something akin to it, like Sengoku Basara, Samurai Warriors or Onimusha back in the PS2 but it does feel like they cut some corners on the content department at the end.

It could be said that is harder than the original, tough jumping lateraly from Nioh(the first one), I didn't really feel a dificulty increase, it can also be argued that if you know what you're doing it gets easier than the first, but as long as you're not getting caught off guard by the sheer ammount of ambushes the game throws at you rapid fire style, you'll be fine, the combat didn't change much after all.

Overall it's a very solid experience, the game does incentivise a change of pace with it's build system even if it requires some previous knowlegde to make the most out of it, i like it very much and I can see myself playing to the last difficulty (something i don't do on other games of the genre since there's no point), if you're a fan of weeb stuff, Dark Souls with the ability to change your character appearance at will, then i wholeheartedly recomend it.

The loot or reward you get from defeating these enemies didn't feel special either. Let's say you just beat a really hard enemy who was guarding a chest, and then when you open it, it just throw bunch of random shit at you and just pray you get a good loot.
Other than that, this game is super cool. From the combat, boss fight, and even the story.

In NIPPON as we call it they KNOW that booba do not end at D-cup, they BEGIN at D-cup.
My ninja wife has immense booba, thank you Japan.

The game is deceptively like a soulslike at first glance, but it is not. The only thing they have in common is the ""bonfire"" & death mechanics.
This is a action RPG centered around personal skill, your build, crafting and your gear with a combat system more like a dedicated fighting game, say like Bayonetta, Metal Gear: Rising, etc.
It oozes mystical and eerie Japanese atmosphere, the presentation reminds me a lot of some Fatal Frame games in the levels i have done so far, which is a good thing. Always that underlying tension, but no jumpscares. Quiet and creepily silent nighttime locales, i love it.

And of course the booba.
In a time where attractive women with nice features is so illegal the thoughtpolice installs a trojan on your computer if you so much as consider installing CBBE on your trashy little Skyrim modlist, its really nice that you can make some truly stunning characters. Males to if you are into that, i am NOT.

Edit:
Have finished the game now at the final difficulty and gone to around level 20 in the RNG dungeon.
The game unfortunately rapidly becomes a slog once you go into the new game+ difficulties with extreme HP spongy enemies that can oneshot you easily with a quick attack if you are wearing light armor.
The 1st run is by far where the fun lies, unfortunately the good gear and fun builds can only be made in the higher difficulties.

Having said that, this game is still one of my absolute favorites of all time.
In part because of the combat system, but much more so because of the story. I can't remember a game where the story has moved me so and made me feel so many strong emotions.
Certain soundtracks still break my heart when i listen to them so long after experiencing the scene where they played.

I could gush endlessly about the story and probably become less and less coherent, but my final opinion would be:

I think you will enjoy the first difficulty, the first time you experience the story and that alone if worth the price to me. But if you are like me you will start to like it less and less as you progress through the difficulties chasing gear to make fun builds that eventually all feel weak.",1672022899,1677095063,True,3,2,0.464788734912872314,0,True,False,False

If you're looking for a new Souls-like game that isn't Dark Souls or Bloodborne, I heard great things about Nioh 2 but way too involved for me who was just looking for a new video game to play.

A roguelite where you have a chance of winning every run with skill is harder than this where your ""skill"" gained is spoiling the content and mechanics over and over from the first mission to the last. This is challenging on a surface level only with time investment and memorization disproportionate to gameplay execution and understanding of the mechanics.

Not to say there isn't deep gameplay and theorycrafting here but instead that a player who knows the content already is going to have an easier time winning with an under-geared character than a first-playthrough player with an over-leveled one.

As such, I doubt the replay-value is going to be that high. Sure, there may be great build variety but when most of the skill comes from knowing ""where, when and how"" over moment-to-moment gameplay, you'll get most of that on your first run.

Were it not for: high price; insane control scheme; console-designed everything and lack of replay-value (in the form of non-linear gameplay or procedural mutators to make each new playthrough fresh and engaging) I might keep Nioh 2 as a great Souls-like to beat at least once (and maybe twice years later) but the price is way too high for that at the moment.

With the current discount at 40% off, I could still buy right now, for the same value, full-price, all of:

- Dead cells
- Grim dawn
- Ziggurat
- Vampire survivor

Each of those games provides me far more intelligent gameplay and depth with actual infinite replay-value - without needing to rely on cheap deaths a dozen times per level so I can pat myself in the back later and say ""I must be really good at video games, it only took me a hundred deaths and two hours to beat this one level""!

Meanwhile actually challenging good games will generate a brand new level for you every single time and require you to use reaction time, game knowledge and theorycrafting plus whatever gear you  find during the run rather than dozens of deaths to acquire a little spoiler knowledge with each time LOL and if you die even once, the game is immediatelly over.

I hope that when I finally try Dark Souls the ambience and world design will deliver because this design ethos based on wholly artificial difficutly ain't it!",1676176769,1676178346,False,1,5,0.255587846040725708,1,True,False,False

If you`re the kind of person that love customizable ""blank slate"" sort of characters for your protagonist and don`t mind it for Nioh, then go for it, Nioh 2 is still a fun souls kind of game in cool Samurai era with demons.

Frustrating to say the least, it can also be tedious, and i have a host of disagreements with some of its game design choices, but even with that said, its still an amazing game. Alot of people compare nioh to darksouls, and while that comparison is fair as they are both 3rd person action rpg's with a punishing death around every corner, nioh is much more rpg than skill based, while there is alot of skill involved, its like how sekiro was different to darksouls and bloodborne, sekiro was less rpg more skill, nioh is the opposite of that. getting better at the game through skill alone will carry you far, but not as far as it might in darksouls, in nioh your going to need good gear and at around level 100, you will need some idea of what build you are gonna be going for, thankfully respecing is easy so your not screwed if you choose to change your build. If your coming from nioh 1 and like me were unsure if you could deal with how unfair this game can be, i assure you, this game is an improvement with the addition of the soul cores and accesability of tempering and rerolls of accessories and various other minor quality of life changes, if is far less draining, but also asks you to manage more, but if you were able to handle the first game this shouldnt be to big a jump. 

If you can, Absolutely play this with a friend using expeditions, it is a superior way to play the game and feels so much more fair.

Disclaimer for anyone who hasn't played the first game, this game throws you in expecting you to already be mildly competent at basic mechanics from the first game, starting here will be a much bigger upfront challenge,  should that be your choice but you sill don't want it to be a nightmare, i would opt for building a tankier character if you don't normally do that and get plenty of heart and courage as those stats will give ki(stamina) and ki regen(stamina regen), also do research on mechanics of the game, it will save you so much headache.

I've been deeply disappointed. Glued to the floor... Dark Souls combat... Dark Souls stamina bar... Dark Souls inventory... all without the benefit of Dark Souls exploration. It's not a successor to Ninja Gaiden. This is the mutant spawn of Ninja Gaiden's corpse, and this dumb, sluggish, artificially difficult Souls-Borne fad. Get yer stoopid stamina bars out of my ninja game!!!!

[strike] I won't refund it, because [/strike] I do want to support Team Ninja, and I did EVENTUALLY want to try one of these Dark Souls games at length... But I am deeply disappointed in them for mimicking their (formerly lesser) peers in the genre and hobbling themselves in the process.

This ain't even CLOSE to being a proper Ninja Gaiden successor imo.

Edit: ...The stance system is an excellent idea. The art style and animations are on point. And it ran great on my machine. It's just a bummer having to jump through the Dark Souls hoops to enjoy it.

I've been trying to push through the issues of latest patch (1.27) but I honestly can't condone this game in its current state. Mid-Mission, the game runs fine. Albeit I tend to get a lot of errors with Summoned Spirits names loading incorrectly or something, but nothing affecting gameplay. However when on the World Map, there is a high likelihood of encountering one of two big issues:
1) Menu Text will begin flickering or vanish entirely.
2) Game crashing frequently while trying to navigate menus.

There is no workaround for the first issue besides just restarting the game. The second issue however can strike randomly when going through menus at the Hut, Shrine, Blacksmith, or Teahouse. Essentially anywhere that has Menus within menus has the opportunity to invite a crash. I've begun a process of completing a few things (selling items, disassembling, or combining Soul Cores) then exiting to the World Map to save my game before moving onto the next step. Mainly because I have no idea when the crash will strike and I don't want to lose progress. The [b]Blacksmith[/b] and the [b]Character Directory in the Hut[/b] are the biggest culprits for this crash.

Until these issues get fixed, I can no longer recommend the game in it's current state. I'll gladly reverse my review once they're fixed.

The game provides deceptively complex battle system taking Souls-like up on a new level. With every fail you blame your skills, especially handling Ki energy - local stamina (it took dozen hours to eventually master it). 
However the point is that on second playthrough you realize that the build matter (and mattered) much more than skill. Every time you have hundreds new items that you must deal with, what makes it feel more like the Diablo 3. Initially you simply get rid of them all but with time you need more meticulous approach especially in grinding sets, merging items and status transfering (hi old school MMOs). The last tens of hours in the pursuit of platinum were especially tiring though can't deny I had some fun on my first playthrough.

Not only am I enjoying it, it's one of the best games I've played in a long time.  Most importantly for me, the combat is remarkable, which is typical of Team Ninja's games (hello Dead or Alive).

Also, it's harder than From's games, but isn't as punishing when you die.  I enjoy all levels of difficulty in games, but I find punishment tiring.  For example, I'm a big fan of fighting games, which have zero punishment and let me immediately dive back in to focus on enjoying the challenge.

Super Meat Boy would be another good example of brutal difficulty but absolutely no punishment.

It's one of the main reasons I never enjoyed From's games, in addition to their simplistic, slow combat.  The punishment in Nioh 2 is mild enough to motivate me, rather than kicking me while I'm down and irritating me.  And OMG THE COMBAT IS SO GUD.

A few tips to enjoy the game and save yourself a lot of frustration:
-Get in the habit of ki pulsing all the time. It's basically always better than letting your stamina regen naturally.
-Use onmyo and/or ninjutsu items, don't just focus on melee. They become very OP later.
-Use your ranged weapon whenever you get a shot on an enemy that doesn't see you. They're actually good unlike the souls games, and headshots let you run up for a free finisher on many enemies. The rifles and cannons in particular can easily one-shot many enemies.
-Practice burst countering but you can just dodge the moves that are too hard to counter consistently.
-Experiment with the different soul cores. Some seem bad on paper but are pretty useful because they're cheap or have some weird utility. 
-Don't forget to apply the modifiers to your combos via the combo menu (The skills that modify attacks). I played hours and hours of this game without even realizing I could do that. 
-Torii gate lets you do missions co-op, but all the enemies are harder. I'd argue it's actually harder than singleplayer because the enemies get way more ki which is a huge issue for yokai in particular. Get a friend in a voice call if you wanna do co-op because you share a health bar with your partner and you don't want some random running off and dying wasting your collective health. Some bosses feel like they're made for co-op (big snake bastard, for instance) so it's advisable to use the Torii gate if a boss is really kicking your ass.",1675022499,1675022499,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Everything about it from the combat to the armor and weapons to the environment are so well done. I won't lie, the story isn't... amazing? It's there though and I didn't really mind it honestly I thought it was decent enough and that's about my biggest criticism of the game. Many people would describe it as a ""souls like"" which is a blatant disservice to Nioh 2 because it stands on it's own two legs and honestly is so far from any ""soulborne"" game. In fact the only commonality between the games is their difficulty. 

Nioh 2 is exactly what I imagine being a ninja/samurai is like. The flow of combat once you get the hang of it isn't something I've experienced until I played Nioh and it's truly it's strongest point. You'll be spinning, twirling, flipping and basically dancing gracefully (or sometimes getting smacked down on your butt) around your opponents and the flow once you're into it [i]feels[/i] REALLY amazing. When you pair combat with the armor/weapon system you can make so many different builds because every piece of armor and weapon is somewhat randomized (think ARPGs Grim Dawn, Diablo, etc gear drops), so you can imagine how much fun you can potentially have trying different sets with different weapon combinations.

Set Q for guard.
Try every weapon on first run and stick to what fits. Prioritise the stats related to that weapon.
Fight bosses and large Yokai with Low Stance to avoid getting caught staggered.
Focus on extending your Ki meter, not your regen as in my opinion its pretty troublesome to hit Shift for the Ki Pulse (stamina regen)
Focus on upgrades that effect Ki as well.
Offer gear to the Shrines in the first few hours before you get the Blacksmith. They give free Amrita that you don't have to work for.
Always die somewhere accessible. Don't fight in a tiger's den expecting to win.
Fight one at a time and hit with High Stance after Grapple or when the enemy is on the floor.
The bow is your best friend at the start, but be mindful of the arrows.

I did find navigation a bit tedious and tiring, though, due to how each level is instanced: I guess that I loved that my progress/unlocked shortcuts/cleared non-respawning enemies were permanents in other Souls-like, non-instanced games.

-Even the weakest human enemies in the first level will deal roughly five times more damage to you than you do to them. It doesn't make any sense for this and it's the wrong way to go about making a game difficult.
-If you decide to engage in co-op, just know that 50% of the time you will get some insufferable teammate with overpowered endgame gear running ahead, one-shotting every enemy and boss without being considerate as to how much they're ruining the game for you in their attempt to flex.

The good things... well the game looks pretty great. Enemy design is awesome, and there is a wide variety of enemies too. Levels look diverse and it never gets too boring unless you go through an area multiple times over for side missions. The customization and depth of combat for the weapons and yokai abilities is insane, and allows for lots of versatility for approaching encounters. There is also a LOT of content, from sub missions, to a long main story, to twilight missions, and after the main story there's tons of additional stuff to tackle and the DLC levels are there too.

Now for the bad stuff. First of all, level design just stinks on ice. The ""shortcuts"" and shrine placement can vary wildly from obscenely far away to unnecessarily close. One mission I was running a freaking marathon of a walk between the first shrine and the next one, and the mission before I rounded a corner and immediately found a door to open right next to the shrine that saved me maybe 15 seconds. Also this game takes the hardcore DS2 approach to enemy placement on steroids. You can bet your ass no fight in this game is mano y mano except boss fights because every single room you enter will ALWAYS have:
-a large enemy
-hidden small enemies
-gunners on top out of your reach

Also enemy design and boss design can be downright atrocious at times. The devs have a really bad habit of giving every single enemy in the game a superarmor grab move they can pull out of nowhere to nearly one shot you (and yes I am not exaggerating EVERY SINGLE ENEMY in the game has this grab, EVERY. SINGLE. ENEMY.). I get boss difficulty wildly varies in a game with this depth of combat, but let me just say this game has an absurdly difficult early game wall with those first two bosses that I'm nearing the end of the game and nothing compares to those two AT ALL.

Overall, combat, customization, how the game looks, and amount of content are all wins. Enemy design, boss design, level design all kinda suck. But hey, if you like killing stuff you'd probably be able to look past that. Overall, I'd slap it with a 6.5/10 or a 7/10.

After reaching 3/4 of the way through Dream of the Wise (NG+3) I'd say it's a very fun game has some really unique combat, story isn't anything memorable for me, but the combat, grinding and learning enemies/bosses is what kept me going for so long.

Combos have the potential to be crazy fun with the stance switch specific moves and move assignment in each stance, a little overwhelming at first but learning it is fun once you get the gist of it, weapon types after different enough and all have their own unique feeling.

Yokai mode is pretty fun, never used it as a main combat thing, more of a panic button when I eventually mess up really bad, but it has so much more potential that I never got to fully experience.

Fists, The weapon class, Fist and Feet for the various demons, Crazy Stamina Drain, Multiple hits, big PP damage, My favourite weapon. It has an attack called Beyond Infinity, it has 5(?) Kinda Just Frame inputs, each one increasing my Beyond Infinity's speed is euphoric and a dopamine hit I need during boss fights. The speed increase, the Kinda Just Frames DINGs of success and visual flair of after image punches and kicks make this move so satisfying to pull off. I'd say Fists are a very oppressive and aggressive weapon type and the trade off is its very stamina hungry and it's what I mainly used through all dreams upto Wise, I felt like I never reached the ""Git Gud"" levels of proficiency but it was still so much fun weaving in all the free form combos I could think of. 

I've dabbled in Tonfa, Odachi and at least reached enough proficiency with every weapon to do their special missions. Tonfa is a pair of spinny bois with fun combo potential, Odachi has a heavy feeling moveset with nice chunky damage and pretty cool attacks.

Oh and you can make a Hot AF Demon Waifu/Husbando as your playable character and I believe you can always change their appearance at nearly all times outside of missions, the character customisation is very nice, one of my favourite character creators of all time, not too complex or simple, just right for me. Game also has a transmog system for the fashion hunters out there, I don't remember how it works but I remember it not being anything too complex or difficult once it's unlocked, I believe you can transmog any gear you've picked up before for a small price.

There is an endgame that I barely touched because I was already burning and burnt out by the time I got there. 

I'd say you'd enjoy this game if you don't mind grinding and min maxing a lot, or just enjoy the combat and escalating difficulty.",1673768046,1673768046,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

  Apart from the small imbalance, just be strategic and you can play without many issues, unlike Dark Souls as it is compared, the combat is a thousand times faster and more complex, with a lot of combos and etcetera to memorize.

It forces players who would otherwise like to continue to attempt harder fights into farming to extend game length. Its a pretty unoriginal and not fun twist on the flask mechanic. Gameplay is good! It can be buggy but that can make it fun too. Leveling is fun but the skill trees are often trivial what matters most really is your stats.

Mechanically, it's better than Nioh 1 in almost every way. 
  
The level design is more even and less 'bull$hitty' than the first. Though I will say the first has some more memorable level designs...or was it because they were so bull$shitty, I remember them...? 
 
The gameplay has been refined and tuned to an almost perfect degree. You will NEVER get tired of burst countering. 
  
The amount of depth in this game is frankly stunning and will keep dedicated players going long into New Game Plus. 
  
Storywise though...Nioh trumps it. While Nioh 2's story is better presented, so I at least know what the hell's going on, the actual writing is weaker. It doesn't help that you, the protagonist, don't have a speaking role (aside from some anime grunts); which makes no sense since they could have easily added voices for whatever gender your avatar was. Plus, I tend to have a mask on, so hearing my avatar talk was necessary, since his facial expressions are mostly covered. It's just a missed opportunity to really give the protagonist a standout role, instead of just an amorphous plot device to move the story forward. 

As well, it tries to do too much: Being its own game, [spoiler]simultaneously[/spoiler] being a prequel [spoiler]and a stealth sequel, as well as wrapping up plot threads from Nioh 1[/spoiler]; but it can't nail the landing and collapses under the weight of it all. The time jumps are jarring, so it's hard to get attached to characters as they come and go. [spoiler]The resolutions for Nioh 1 feel disappointing and anti-climactic (dare I say, even rushed).[/spoiler] By the time it‚Äôs over, the ending comes off as flat and lacking significant closure. 

As well, Nioh 2's DLC is pretty disappointing and kind of greedy. Compared to Nioh 1, Nioh 2 really relies on its DLC to fill in the plot holes and finish up the story. You could have ended Nioh 1 right then and there and would have been fine. It had closure. And then its DLC CONTINUED the story on its own merits. Yes, it left some plot threads open, but even then, it gave us mostly closure, AND IT PUSHED THE STORY FORWARD. 
 
Nioh 2's DLC story[spoiler], though, is not only a weak time travel plot, but it[/spoiler] feels backwards and doesn't really do anything other than retread ground to explain why certain things happened. The whole opening of Nioh 2 is explained in the final DLC. Why couldn't this have somehow been integrated into Nioh 2 and saved us some money? AND then, continue the story to something fresh and forward. 

But this is like knocking a number off a 10/10 game. So, a 9/10 it is. 
 
It's very worthwhile and one of the best action RPGs in the last few years.

EDIT: With more time to process, this is a solid 8/10 for me. I love the gameplay refinements and moment to moment combat, but the story really did disappoint me both from a narrative standpoint; on top of a weak finish with underwhelming DLC (especially compared to the strong finish of Nioh 1 with amazing DLC).",1669425346,1673118999,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat system has 3 stances, and each their own unique moves. The game heavily encourages experimentation -- do not be shy away from it. Reallocating your points is available at any time, changing your appearance, as well as transmog for your armor AND weapons. 

The story is not the strongest part of the game, albeit enjoyable. If you're looking for a Souls-like that provides a relatively more challenging experience, I highly recommend picking up this game.

Every time I install it after taking a break I get surprised by how fun it is. 

Nioh 2 a fast souls-like with a vast amount of customization. Not only do you have a pretty in-depth character creator but also smaller PoE like skill trees for every weapon type; 

- 11 melee weapons
- 3 ranged
- 2 magic trees
- 1 transformation tree
- And if i remember correctly, a Samurai skill tree.

These contain both active and passive skills that can be purchased  with skill-points gained by using the relevant weapon/magic in combat. This system is on top of and separate from the classic souls leveling you recognize from other games in the genre.

After unlocking skills in a weapon tree you can use them to customize your attacks to further build your character the way you want. I.E., Maybe put a hand chop as a finisher after light attacks, or perhaps you instead fancy a retreating strike? You choose. 

This freedom is amazing to me. On top of this, all weapons have three different stances; 

- Slow, high power but low evasion
- All-around decent 
- Speedy, low power with high evasion

All three stances can be customized and seamlessly switched between in combat. 

On top of this you can also use your defeated enemies abilities in combat, like in some Castlevania games. On death enemies souls can drop which you can equip on your chosen God and then use their abilities for yourself. There are alot of gods and they all have differing stats and buffs. Just choose the one that seems fun (you can change between levels if you like).
 
I would say this is the hardest souls-like out of the big ones and if you're prone to rage, maybe don't get it? You'll likely break something.
The enemies hit HARD. But gods damn it's satisfying to finally learn the boss pattern and end them after 9 grueling deaths.
 
Add to all this a Diablo-style loot system, co-op with up to 2 friends, and a story you most likely don't care about, and you got Nioh 2.

One of the best part is that the rapey invasion bullshit from dark souls isn't in this one.

Get it on a sale and try it out. Maybe skip the character creator at first and get in the game quickly to get the most out of the 2 test hours on steam.

Combat developed by Team Ninja (creators of Ninja Gaiden) in a Souls-like lens with a Diablo-style ARPG loot system. Tons of enemy variety, extremely unique weapon and varied styles of play.


Incredible amount of content. If you play this game, expect to be able to sink a ton of time into it if you'd like. If you truly want to unlock everything and complete every difficulty, expect multiple hundreds of hours. If you simply want to focus on a couple of specific weapons and blast through the difficulties, you can do that too.


Individuals have spent thousands of hours playing this game on the merits of the combat alone. I myself find almost all of the weapons to be enjoyable enough that I could see myself spending hundreds of hours practicing with the weapons in this game. Unlike Souls-like games, the combat can be lightning-fast much like Team Ninja's previous titles.


The RPG elements of the game are there for fun and optimization, as well as crafting a specialized build based on your tastes, and to scale your weapons to do the highest amount of damage possible or pump HP to live while taking extra hits. Much like Souls games, however, the combat is 100% skill based and you're capable of dodging and blocking every attack, which means that it is not a -requirement- to have an optimized build or hit a level milestone to progress in the game. I personally prefer a more balanced approach to the game and find fulfillment in using my entire arsenal, but the game also supports pumping a few major stats and using just a couple of key skills for each weapon that are extremely strong, which makes it easier, cheesier and more Souls-like which can be fun sometimes and is absolutely a viable way to play the game.


Co-op works flawlessly, and is the best implementation of Co-op in a game like this. On the basic difficulty, I played through the game with a friend of mine the entire way through. Both of us shared the same progression through all main and side missions. You can play 100% of the main story missions co-op and you can play 95% of the side missions in the game co-op


I really only have three very minor gripes with the game:

1. The game is incredibly deep mechanically, and while that is fantastic for increasing the skill ceiling, I don't feel like the game is super explicit in explaining some of the more important stuff to you, it kinda just flashes a pop-up at you once and then you move on. More in-game tutorials here and there might have been more beneficial, because I actually ended up learning a lot by looking up videos. On the same topic, there are SO many mechanics and stats in this game that you just kinda have to mouse over to expand the details because the names of the stats will not tell you the full story, even stats that seem obvious.

2. The story is pretty meh. There are some spectacular cutscenes and there's enough there to keep me engaged, but nothing I'd write home about.

3. I wish there was more options in customizing the look of your character's gear.

Nioh 2 feels abit to easy compared to Nioh 1, i understand the fixed the leveling system in Nioh 2 which is amazing and makes you feel like your actually stronger against weak enemies but not gonna lie that is what made Nioh, Nioh in a sense. 

Nioh 2 feels like you are gifted with being half demon and half human which makes you way to strong off the bat... in Nioh one not gonna lie it took me like 30 tries to beat the first mini boss but in Nioh 2 i beat Gozuki on the 3rd try after i realized i have an OP af counter that can make me pretty much stagger him and get free damage, now note i do understand the first boss shouldn't be so hard but after that fighting Mezuki was even more easy i beat him on the second try, after this i haven't died yet and i feel way to strong at this point.

I give the game a solid 8/10 for being really fucking amazing but i miss how hard the game was to make you realize you cant just go in an take on 3 enemies at once, the game makes you think like a samarai in Nioh 1 but in Nioh 2 well you can just go FAST AF BOI AND WIN EZ LOL i love this game but it just feels to easy all im saying.",1672230363,1672230363,True,0,0,0.490719735622406006,0,True,False,False

Nioh 2 is a souls-like game, it shares a lot of similarities to fast paced ninja games like Ninja Gaiden and Onimusha as well. The five main conceits of Nioh 2:

1. The Ki (like stamina) system provides bonuses to playing on a cadence, gives buffs, makes boss encounters feel like MMO phases, and provides a good asymmetry to human and yokai encounters.
2. Most unblockable moves are counter-able via a mechanic called Burst Counter, of which there are three flavors. All unblockables are telegraphed with high clarity on type.
3. Monster Hunter style weapon choices with an activity based (earned through using) skill system that rewards investment but doesn't punish experimentation.
4. A flashy yokai ultimate form that gives the player further control over the encounters.
5. A good blending of Yokai mythology and Sengoku history make this grounded, yet anime, and quirky. For instance there are yokai that you can threaten to leave you alone, others you can stun by shooting them in the eye. Always hit the glowy bits if possible.

Other notable differences:
- Loot system is a bit bonkers like Diablo. Most of the time you get trash, but some have inheritable traits that require you to use the item to allow it to pass.
- Relatively easy access to Respeccing, you do need to beat two bosses, and starting stats are locked in.
- Magic playstyles require you to fight in melee.",1672122988,1672122988,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bounced hard off of Nioh 1, but after spending so much time with this, I think I'll go back and have anohter go. I won't be comparing the games at all here, because I have very little memories of Nioh 1, aside from a vague sense of frustration.

Nioh 2 is a 3rd person action game with rpg mechanics. You play as a mysterious warrior with demon powers on a quest around an alternative reality feodal era Japan. You meet and fight various historical figures, who may or may not have demon powers, slaughter thousands of various demonical entitities straight from Japanese folk lore and gather so, so, so many different weapons, armor sets and items.

What separates Nioh from other similar games are the three stances and the ki-burst systems. Each melee weapon can be wielded in a high-powerered stance that drains your stamina greatly, a mixed-powered stance that seems to emphasise blocking and counters, and a nimble stance with a great dodge and fast attacks. You can switch weapons and stances after attacks to replenish your stamina and dispel some adverserial effects. Being good at stance switching means you will be able to keep up the pace of the combat, and do some ridiculous combos on the enemies. It's great fun and a very versatile system. The weapons themselves are very varied, and most feel good to use. There are chains, axes, staves, tonfas, swords a-plenty and even a magical scythe.

The enemies that you smack around with the weapons are tough. Most can 2-4 hit kill you, they can stun you easily if yo aren't careful, they can grapple you through your block and sometimes they ambush you by dropping from trees, or snipe at you from a long distance. They can take a beating too! And the bosses are even worse - with huge health pools, massive attacks and fast recoveries - you will have to battle for you victories. And I think that in the end the bosses and enemies are challenging, but fun to fight. The humanoid bosses are even better, since you can parry their attacks, which leads to a fun dance-around. Unlike Sekiro, the parry isn't the be-all end all of the playstyle, so I like Nioh better.

You don't have to battle alone either! You can leave a mark on the ground and a clone of your character can be summoned by other players to aid their quest, and you will be rewarded for doing this. Dead players will spawn red graves that you can challenge for additional rewards. Good fun, and quite a synergistic system, as the grave-spawned enemies will give resources to summon friendly characters.

There's plenty to do in Nioh 2, as apprantly the New Game+ feature will unlock even more crafting and battling options, along with harder missions. There are hidden skills for all weapon styles, lots of enemy skills to capture, the crafting system is pretty fun and you can have all sorts of weird and synergistic builds. I have spent 70+ hours just diddling around side content, grinding missions and crafting and trying all sorts of weapons and I haven't even seen the final boss. 

It controls well, looks pretty, has lots to do, is hard but fair (mostly). I got it on sale for 40‚Ç¨ and I have no regrets.",1671724530,1671724530,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game demands active combat, dodging and Ki (Stamina) management and punishes the more ""Stay back and wait for openings"" gameplay that is more common in other soulslike games.
The game also dramatically changes after NG, where in later NG cycles (Specifically NG++ onwards) where builds become game altering. The gameplay shifts into a hyper aggressive playstyle where stunlocking an Enemy is necessary to defeat bosses.
It should be noted that NG+ (onwards) adds new mechanics, loot and sets, and changes enemy placements (and later NG+s adds later enemies into earlier stages, including DLC enemies).

Fantastic game - but do not go in thinking ""I played Dark Souls therefore I know how to play this game"" - because this ain't Dark Souls, you will need to be hyper aggressive to succeed, you will need to use Stance Switching and Ki Pulsing (Stam Management mechanic), and the game will punish you severely if you don't.",1671449490,1671449490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good. Gameplay and story, both surprising for a returning player and enjoyable!
Bad. Some glitches.. Notably with steam connection to 'legacy' users.

Online presence is pretty good. Not gonna lie, I am underleveled and overpowered due to some bored helpers... But that doesn't ever stop the fun of the game. 
Only thing that STILL annoys me from Nioh 1 is the way that clans work. The one clan that gives you bonus XP is the most saturated one in the game. XD",1670569351,1670569351,True,1,0,0.490549057722091675,1,True,False,False

The game plays a bit different in that here there seem to be no nuke abilities which you make huge with your build, you rather prepare for slashing the enemies with multiple combos and skills, this is not bad but I prefer Nioh again. Also there are not many bosses or locations which are super memorable like in Nioh. They also reused a ton of assets from the first game, locations and monsters included. Armor sets were somehow not as cool looking too. And one thing I absolutely hate is this fucking protagonist, comes out of nowhere, no one knows who or rather what the fuck you are, and you're a mute of all things... William was a tough badass who didn't speak much but this thing is just beyond me.

I have to say that the game is frankly amazing in terms of its depth, game-play, level design, variety of weapons, skills, forging of items, attributes, etc., etc.  It is a very deep and involved game.  The character controls and ability to specialize as well as all of the add-on things that can be done is astounding (e.g., obtaining titles and skill points, tea house, etc.).  It is almost too much.  The play is compelling and the story line is one of the best I have seen - certainly as good or better than Sekiro.  I think this game is much better than sekiro and I thought it was a great game.  The replayability of this game is tremendously better than sekiro in my opinion.

All that said, this game WILL NOT appeal to a vast swath of gamers out there in that the game is difficult to learn.  Similar to From Software titles the documentation is nil and you have to figure everything out yourself or by watching YouTube tutorials.  Given the depth and complexity of the game and the control mechanics learning this game is no small task.  Expect to spend at least 1/3 of your time just trying to figure out the game.  As various players have said that have invested way more time in this game than I have you don't really get access to certain skills, weapons, and armor until new game or new game +.  So think about that for a minute and put it in perspective of a play-through of Elden Ring.   This game is a beast.  I personally think it is one of the greatest game designs of all time for an action RPG given the content and replayabiity.  Seriously, it is that good if you like this type of game.  It is souls like or sekiro like but taken to a totally different level of design, story, and gameplay.  I highly recommend it if you are a fan of those types of games and are willing to invest the time to learn all about it.",1670189133,1670189133,True,8,0,0.53857189416885376,0,True,False,False

This game has a similar feel to the Dark Souls games, but in my honest opinion? way easier and much more fun to get into. You have 13 weapon types to choose from  (you can use 2 different weapons at any given time), with each weapon type having its own skill tree that increases the combo potential. There are 3 stances for the weapons: High stance focuses on pure damage, but it takes up the most Ki (stamina); Mid stance is your blocking stance, blocking in mid stance takes the least amount of Ki out of your bar, and most weapons have a parry skill that can be used in mid stance; Low stance is your dodge stance, dodging in low stance is super fast and fluid, and a lot of the weapons have skills that relate to dodging while in low stance. The weapon types and stances make the game's combat feel much more fleshed out, and even if you fall into the routine of one or two combos, there's still plethora of options to choose from. 

What makes it easier to get into in my opinion, is the guardian spirit/yokai form mechanic. At the start you can choose between one of three guardian spirits, each giving their own stat buffs and other passives. However; the biggest part of the guardian spirit system is the Yokai Form. Each guardian spirit has one of three yokai forms (brute, feral, and phantom), and each form corresponds to your yokai switch (where you briefly turn into a yokai) and your burst counter (a counter move for specific enemy attacks). I always choose the brute form, to which I also recommend to any and all new players, because of its simplicity: the form? Big fuck off kanabo and go crazy. The counter? Hit the mf. But I alsop implore everyone to try out the other forms and pick which is best for you and your playstyle.

Now let's talk about some of the other pluses, starting with character customization. 
OH MY FUCKIN GOD IS IT GOOD, its extremely in depth, you can incrementally change your nose angle if you want, among many other things. Another thing to note hair system, too many times in souls likes you see only two ""styles"" of afro hair, either an afro, or braids. Not in Nioh, here you can select any hair style you wish, and then choose the curl amount, from stick straight hair to almost coily. I'll be frank, it doesn't look good on every style, but there is such a wide variety of hair styles, and you can make them all your own. Another topic about the hair I like is once you choose a base hairstyle, you can select the parts, whether it be the bun/ponytail, the bangs, as well as the sides of the hair. Its a very in depth system and its also the part I take the longest on. I'm also quite fond of the tattoo and markings in the character customization, the scars don't look fake and you can freely adjust size and placement. The tattoos do seem a bit saturated when you first apply them, but you can turn down their opacity to make them fit better. In addition to all of this, you can directly input character codes so you can upload the appearance of someones character, if you so desire.

My favorite part of this game though, has to be the story.
Don't come into this game expecting a God Of War/Horizon level of depth and detail; because at the base this game is all about the combat. HOWEVER, you can expect way more story than what most other Souls Likes are giving you. This game also takes place during the Unification of Japan, and thus you meet quite a few influential figures from that time. (ie Oda Nobunaga and Hattori Hanzo) Also the ""codex"" of this game, which you can view by visiting your hut and looking at the illustrations, is extremely well written. For characters, the game tells you about their historical deeds, but also how they have interacted with the protagonist and the story. For the enemies, the first entry will always give you the mythos and folklore about the yokai, whereas the latter entries may give you hints on how to defeat them easier. 

That's enough of a rant from me, but its a VERY good game, and you will drop 70+ hours into this easily",1670147602,1670147602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A big improvement on Nioh 1, adding to the series' unique entry into the genre with fast paced, combo based combat. There is no pvp in Nioh 2 unlike the small pvp system in 1, but the coop system and other player interactions are fairly well integrated into the game.

Nioh is mission based rather than open world but keeps even reused levels somewhat interesting by changing time of day and blocking/opening paths to make navigation different, even reversed at times. Its story is Japanese mythology laid over a loose take on mid to late Sengoku period, effectively a prequel to the first game with some tie-ins, but largely separated and stands alone. New Game Plus goes up to +4, and each level of NG+ is separately crafted, changing enemy spawns and bringing new mechanics to players and enemies.

The Nioh series has a fairly different form of character progression where gear drops are randomized and plentiful, increasing in level as you progress, and usually more important than character level. This makes the game mildly MMO-like as gear becomes outdated through game progression. There is an upgrade system to update a nice piece of gear to current levels, but it gets pricy to constantly do.

With its different take on stamina with the ki system, combat flows very smoothly when mastered. The defensive options regularly reward mixing up blocking, dodging, countering, and sometimes ki pulses in response to enemies. Ranged weapons are very useful throughout the game, being able to knock down or outright kill weaker enemies from stealth before combat. 11 different types of melee weapons and 3 different ranged weapon types each with fairly distinct abilities brings a lot of options to try out.

While there is a lot of good about the game, it does have its flaws. The English localization is a bit questionable. The story is passable, having a lot of points from Japanese history but handwaving over a lot of details for yellow glowing stones. Most keybinds can be changed, but one specifically can't. There's a bug disabling online trying to connect Epic crossplay.

I think my biggest complaint against other soulslikes is that its art style and textures are a bit independent looking in comparison to the big boys like FromSoftware and are not aging in the best manner overall. However, they have some outstanding character models, enemy/boss design, and in my opinion captured the fantasy aspects of their interpretation of feudal Japan far better than Sekiro did, in my opinion. I think there's absolutely an argument to be made that Sekiro is a better and more rewarding game, but this game is also far, far longer than that game, even without its DLCs. I can't say it's as easy to come back to other Soulsike games as it is to come back to this masterpiece and jump right back into the combat like you're riding a bike. The RPG elements of Dark Souls are absolutely here too, except with far more depth with the inclusion of in-depth skill trees for each weapon and Yokai abilities giving you an edge in what most people consider is one of the hardest soulslikes on the market. For me personally, I don't find the game nearly as difficult or as punishing as Elden Ring or Sekiro, but it is still outstanding nonetheless. 

I believe I'm going to get people saying that I can't review the game at 11 hours, I will note that with other methods I was able to obtain the game on PC beforehand, before ultimately deciding to buy it for full price on steam given how exceptional the game is, and I also have completed a second playthrough on Playstation as they were giving the game away for free a month ago.

The character creation is insanely good, and must be praised!
Overall the game is not bad, but the lack of a constant map to progress in, valuable loot, and the repetition of bosses really hurt the game, without mentioning the constant map reuse even from Nioh 1, which was appreciated at first but they are just part of the rotation, not a nice easter egg or addition.
I played through all of it with a friend and while we were not extremely happy with it, we still liked playing it. Exploring a map is useless as rentering won‚Äôt keep the doors open, so the game encourages rushing. Bosses keep being reused to the point that I and my friend had a running joke about the boss Tatarimokke and the few times it had been used compared to the final boss of the game that in the DLC is a constant plague in almost all missions. When side content like this feels like a chore, to a completist it‚Äôs painful not to do everything is what burns you out very quickly. Add this to slowly losing any care of loot as 90% of the time is trash you‚Äôll sell for money or break down for material. At least there is a transmog system, but that is only a placebo to avoid frustrating the player changing armor every few missions. The DLCs are what kind of hit the nail in the coffin, as they kept adding three story missions and 15 side missions of reused assets. Those last 20h were very painful. Overall the game is good, but when you also add that to see the endgame you need to finish it 5 times incrementally‚Ä¶well, it‚Äôs a bit much. 

5/10. Not a bad game, but not one I would go back to playing. I would have probably dropped it earlier if it wasn‚Äôt for my friend.",1612997178,1669825610,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The game is still souls-like to the core but sprinkle in a little Devil May Cry and Ninja Gaiden and you get this game. Bosses are fairly challenging but once you know the mechanics, you'll feel like you're on equal grounds with bosses. You still have to play cautiously like in most souls games but most times, you can be as aggressive as you want if know what you're doing. 
Combat feels slightly slower than Nioh 1 but this makes up for it by giving you a lot more tools to deal with enemies. Most of the enemies hit a lot harder than in Nioh 1 also which can seem ridiculous at 1st but honestly, you can cheese many bosses and enemies so easily that I think this isn't as much an issue. Bosses also feel like they're slightly tankier but that's because they balanced Guardian Spirits where it's not a win button anymore. Only issue I have with bosses is that human bosses feel way too strong since they regenerate ki way too fast and regenerate it quickly.
Combat gets some getting used to but once you get used to it, you'll feel like the boss.

There's more of everything: more levels, move enemies, more weapons, more skills and generally more systems to upgrade your character. You can even collect tea sets. Audiovisuals are just slightly better, but Nioh 2 still is a pretty game. Sadly the main storyline suffers from this avalanche of gameplay options. I'd call it incoherent and that's putting it nicely. Controls are fiddly; it's clearly a game made for gamepad (console). The UI is somewhat cluttered and not all systems are clearly explained. Perhaps I didn't pay attention, but  after 150 hours I discovered how to switch between guardian spirits. Yup, there's a lot going on in this game. Sometimes less is more. Clearly Nioh 2 didn't get that note.

And that's mostly fine actually. After the improved character generation I played Nioh 2 with my regular coop buddy. This was our first Souls experience together. Barring a bit of lag in a few missions the coop experience was flawless. About 99% of the levels can be played in coop, a few arena boss missions being the exception. We had a bloody good time. Coop makes pincer tactics more viable and it's nice to see each other's character and skills grow.

All in all: Nioh 2 isn't perfect, but it *is* an extremely solid Souls and coop game. It's also a big time investement. If you're looking for that type of game, then look no further.

- Armor buffs are nerfed to the ground compared to Nioh 1
- +%1 damage increase only specific to one weapon if your health is %30 is a joke

This is a huge improvement over Nioh 1, which already was a top tier game. Old enemies have their movesets revamped, new enemies are added which grant the game a ridiculous amount of enemy variety. Both human and yokai bosses are significantly improved over Nioh 1. Returning weapons have new moves added to their moveset alongside 4 new amazing weapons. Skill tree is also revamped and feels slightly better to use now. Magic and Ninjutsu is deeper than the first game with many different abilities added and preparing jutsu is significantly better in this game. Character creator is praised a lot, but I've barely changed the look of my character so I can't really comment on that. Biggest improvement over the first game is, imho, the game's balance. Nioh 1's missions kind of took a nose dive in the endgame with the game just making you fight several bosses at the same time in so many side missions and human enemies spamming living weapon like there's no tomorrow. Both problems are fixed in Nioh 2, and it feels amazing to play thanks to that. Side missions are still fun and innovative by the endgame, and the human boss of DLC2 is one of the best fights in the game.

One flaw(and downgrade from Nioh 1) in the game is the story. Nioh 1 already had a weak story, and this one is somehow even worse. Nobunaga is extremely whitewashed for some reason, which makes him less interesting than his other portrayals in media. DLCs have better story than the main game, and they take you to Heian period which is a time we rarely see in games. I like them a lot because of this.

Long story short, this game is quite definitely a masterpiece, and everyone should definitely play it. It's filled to the brim with content, especially if you're in for new game plusses.

The stance switching, the skills, the weapon types, the skill trees, the stat points, the level cap, the spells, the combat, the damage numbers, the lootsplosions, the difficulty and most importantly the builds and almost infinite replayability when it comes to making multiple builds and testing them out is what makes me fall in love with Nioh 1 and 2.

However, Team Ninja needs to hold off/back on nerfing certain things or video game companies need to start letting us select what PATCH we can play on so if we want to make an absolutely monstrous multiplicative damage build when we are done with the game, we can.

Stranger of paradise was OK but it just wasn't Nioh and wo long looks decent but it looks like it is lacking a lot of Nioh features and is going to be more like Sekiro which don't get me wrong was a good game but I only played it once and finished it, Nioh you just keep coming back to make and perfect your builds.",1669207421,1669207421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But then after some experimenting I realised, that it was because I tries to play it the same way I played NIOH 1, and this is a different one.

DON'T USE DOUBLE BLADES WHIRLWIND BUILD

Also things to consider:

1) The same insane clogged menu and tedious inventory managment from NIOH, which makes you feel overwhelmed and bored.

2) The game has like a TON of buttons wich you need to be constantly clicking. You need to switch stances, use demon abilities, transform, dodge, DODGE BURST ATTACKS (completely different buttons from the regular dodge), chain attacks and skills. If you mess some, you are dead.

This is not a con by itself, but the game has the hardest start and learning curve of all known to me soulslike games, Game is much harder than NIOH 1, because it has much more game mechanics embedded into, and you can't really ignore them.

[b][u]Let me start with the flaws, since there aren't that many[/u][/b]:
[olist]
[*][b]The PC port for this game isn't the best[/b]. It's a 7/10 in most regards. You will need a decent rig.¬†
[*][b]Story isn't bad but it isn't as good as it potentially could be[/b]. Don't play this game if you're looking for a rich narrative and fleshed out characters.¬†
[*][b]Drop rates for certain things can be unreasonably low[/b]. Grinding isn't at all necessary to beat all the content the game has to offer. However, if you want perfect gear rolls with perfect passives for your desired playstyle, you will have to do a lot of grinding.
[*][b]The game throws you to the wolves[/b]. It doesn't teach you most of its essential techniques and habits for playing well. Much like with fighting games, if you want to learn important basic techniques or tap into this game's high skill ceiling, you're gonna have to look around on gaming forums and follow specific YouTube channels and social media accounts.¬†
[*][b]Visibility and framerate can both take a huge dip during co-op[/b]. Even in single player, visual clarity can be a problem at times with all the effects going on during battle.¬†
[*][b]Getting skill points early on can be a rather slow process[/b].¬†Be sure to explore levels thoroughly for skill point items to expedite this process!
[*][b]Endgame loot and inventory management can be very tedious[/b]. Especially if you're serious about getting the best gear.¬†
[/olist]
[b][u]Now onto all the great things:[/u][/b]
[olist]
[*][b]An insane amount of content[/b]. There are a total of 28 main missions and 85 side missions, alongside extra dojo missions and hard-mode missions of existing main missions. Then there are also numerous arcade-like enemy rush extra missions, and an endgame dungeon system numbering in at over 100 floors worth of encounters that is only available on the hardest difficulty. You're looking at a game with at least 70 hours of content if all you want to do is solo and beat every single main, side and DLC mission on the game's base difficulty for a first-time playthrough.
[*][b]The most comprehensive New Game Plus system of any Souls-like game to date[/b]. Unlike the From Software games that inspired it, Nioh 2 actually has a robust New Game Plus system that adds numerous changes to the game. Instead of just having New Game Plus be ""the exact same game but with enemies doing more damage, having more health and giving you more experience points"", Nioh 2 changes up enemy placements, gives most enemies new moves, offers new game modes and unique loot types that you can only get on higher difficulties, in addition to having an actual endgame system. The game's New Game Plus system itself offers immense freedom in the order you pursue each mission.
[*][b]Playstyle variety and viability out the wazoo[/b]. Yes, there are some specific cheesy builds that are more powerful and easy to use than others, but in terms of viability, the sky is the limit. It's virtually impossible to have a ""bricked"" build in this game that you can pinpoint as the source of blame in case you fail to progress past a difficult challenge. As long as your action gaming fundamentals are solid, then you can make any build work all the way to endgame.¬†Don't listen to the scrubs who tell you that the game ""forces"" you to play specific lame and cheesy ways, because in 99% of cases, it doesn't.¬†
[*][b]Combat depth out the wazoo[/b]. The amount of dexterity and execution required if you want to play at the highest possible skill level rivals that of the greatest character action games out there like Devil May Cry 3. You want a game that you can spend hundreds of hours labbing just to be able to perform the most stylish tech and combos? Play Nioh 2.
[*][b]Throwing out Pok√©mon to attack during combat[/b]. This game has an Igavania-inspired enemy ""soul core"" system that allows you to absorb the powers of enemies and use them seamlessly in combat to extend combos, control crowds and pick apart enemies.
[*][b]A co-op system that is easy to get up and running[/b]. That is, unlike the From Software games that inspired Nioh 2. Want to play co-op? Just open up a room and have people join. Or you can join existing rooms.
[*][b]The best videogame soundtrack of 2020[/b]. Even if you read this review and still don't want to play the game, at least go listen to the soundtrack on YouTube. You won't regret it. Be sure to also listen to the DLC boss fight tracks.
[*][b]A robust and easy-to-use character creator[/b]. You can input character codes shared from other Nioh 2 players on the internet to instantly copy their character look if you so desire. Oh, and unlike some other games, you have zero restrictions on how much you can alter the look of your character. You can, at any point in the game, change how your character's face¬†looks. No arbitrary limitations per playthrough (*cough*Dark Souls 3*cough*) and no needing to pay vouchers with real money to change your look (I'm looking at you, Monster Hunter games!).
[*][b]You can actually PAUSE the damn game[/b]. This is unlike the games that inspired Nioh 1 and 2 that insist on not having any kind of pause feature even if you are playing offline. And guess what? Pausing does NOTHING to reduce the difficulty of the game! Shocking, ain't it? How could anyone be dumb enough to think that having a pause feature would trivialize a game's difficulty?
[*][b]Game always gives you free ways to boost damage[/b]. No matter how terrible you think your gear drops are, the game always has universal damage modifiers you always have access to that more than compensate for sub-par gear. Just attacking enemies from behind alone does 50 percent extra damage without having any specific stats or passives on you.¬†
[*][b]The fashion game in Nioh 2 is top tier[/b]. Thanks to the ability to refashion/transmog the look of your gear that is available right from the get-go, you will never have to go around looking like a buffoon wearing a clownsuit.
[*][b]Playing in co-op adds extra enemies in missions and even adds minions to boss fights[/b]. The developers had the foresight to do this so that players people wishing to go through by co-op can have levels designed with co-op in mind for a proper challenge, unlike a certain other famous developer with games that keep enemy counts the same regardless of how many players there are in co-op, which leads to the levels being a cakewalk in those games since they aren't designed to deal with multiple players.
[*][b]Earlier missions never become obsolete in terms of difficulty thanks to the game's ""level sync"" feature that raises enemy power to match your current character level and gear.[/b] This ""level sync"" feature is entirely optional. Want to overpower earlier levels? Don't activate it. Want to ensure your revisits of earlier content remain challenging? Activate it.
[*][b]No Bayonetta/God of War-esque gimmick levels[/b]. When you spend an hour playing Nioh 2, you spend an hour mostly doing the combat instead of suffering through mini-games or forced walking sequences or needlessly-obtuse, time-wasting puzzles that have nothing to do with the core gameplay.
[*][b]Very good mouse and keyboard controls and customizability[/b]. Though I honestly don't recommend playing this game with MKB controls since it's a very steep learning curve to a game that already has a very steep learning curve.
[*][b]Nioh 2 and Nioh 1 are the only popular games I know of that actually give you the option to skip cutscenes you have already viewed[/b]. This is huge for a game that gives nearly every boss a unique introductory cutscene. In other games, if you die 10 times to a boss, you'll have to mash through that boss's pre-fight cutscene 10 times. Not in Nioh 2.¬†

But where it surpasses Souls games, it surpasses spectacularly, which is the complex combat mechanics. So if you're more into the combat side of things in RPG rather than the adventure RPG in souls. then nioh is definitely a good game to get. 

Graphical fidelity is also better than souls, which probably explains the huge storage requirement.

Would recommend this game SOLELY on combat alone. I think it rivals MH (Monster Hunter) in terms of combat depth. If you want engaging combat with lots of potential and good build crafting get this. But there's a big, big, BIG caveat.

This was a lot harder for me than even Sekiro due to 3 things: bloat values, extreme stamina management, and (IMHO) subpar animations/telegraphs, when compared to FS (From Software) and MH.

1. Bloat values:
This game will 1-shot and 2-shot you a LOT more compared to NG+4 above Souls games, including Sekiro. Early playthroughs can mitigate this with higher defense and toughness (hyper armor), but on higher NG+ cycles you'd better have gotten gud already, because not only will you get stun locked to oblivion if you get hit, but bosses will have very high amounts of health. Expect end game boss battles to take as long as a monster hunt in MH.

2. Extreme stamina management
Stamina is even more of a premium in this game compared to From games. You take health AND stamina damage when you get hit. Every time you get hit, if you fail the hyper armor check, you'll flinch. This doesn't have hyper armor, so if you happened to get grazed by a multi hit combo, you're gonna be eating that whole combo unless you block timely (which also costs a LOT of stamina). Deplete your bar and you enter winded state; at this point you're pretty much stunned and dead, as most enemies will move in for a grapple and 1/2 shot you... Early on this really restricts what combos/movesets you can enjoy. I've heard it gets better on ng+4 onwards once you get better gear, but... idk. Sounds poorly balanced to me if it takes that long.

3. Inferior animations (compared to MH and Souls)
This is probably down to preference. I'd still rate MH at the top in terms of fair combat animations. FromSoft used to be a close tie. While still great, recent experiences with Malekith and other super fast telegraphed bosses in Elden Ring have taken From down a couple notches for me. Everyone seems obsessed with Bloodborne and Sekiro speeds these days, but I digress. Team Ninja is nowhere near that ballpark of animation excellence. You'll see a lot of sliding feet, jerky telegraphs, and most attacks are covered by particle effects and big damage numbers. You can hide the numbers; the effects, not so much. This makes reading your enemies much harder on top of the already mid animation quality.

All in all, I'd still recommend this game. But be VERY wary of the difficulty that awaits you. Personally, after having experienced this game I'm VERY VERY cautious of Team Ninja's upcoming Wild Hearts, and will most likely pass if it ends up being as ""balanced"" as Nioh 2.",1667477973,1667477973,True,16,8,0.580470860004425049,0,True,False,False

Better than , first game 
pro:
more weapons 
more stable close quarter fight 
high sharp quality but you need 1 million man approvie quality same as soulsborn
more helpful not like classic soulsborn always show the path and how to do it 
online gameplay really smooth when some people write on walls or stones for call you not call him self you call the player npc and its really helpfull but one condition you need find summon resource and its cost by lv's if its higher lv you need pay more stones for summon.
and diffrent summon type is invoke summon you can summon goku's or saiyan's help the oneshot boss (actually when i enter my first boss i cant even attacked him they shot'ed boss
i said more weapons and they added skill tree you can gear up your weapons and lv up this weapons and you can unlock some moves special attack and more
and this game have mechanic name is yokai it working like rage bar when bar is full charged you can activate and transform boss (The choice is yours which one you will become). and they updgraded too if you kill area mini bosses you obtain skill and you can added your form but they have cost too
they added so much item for a create some crazy build yeah you can be god in game not joking 
cons:
if you like soulsborn games you like this game too but if you dont like grind base soulsborn especially hard grind souls then you cant love cause (game have mission system if you want unlock next area you need kill main area boss and next area unlock) if you want go next level and your lv is 10 but next lvl is 15 then you need grind until 16 cause you cant dmg mobs
and this is it nioh 2 if you can play souls then go in bro",1667078222,1667159299,True,2,0,0.540069699287414551,0,True,False,False

Difficult games like Nioh rewards players for being tenacious and undefeated by failure, it's built on the fact that you can try and try again and will succeed if you have the persistence. However in multiplayer gameplay, this changes; the core importance of being able to try again is stripped away. Whenever you die a certain amount, your group is penalized with by halving all amrita earned used to level up your character. To circumvent this, you have to end the session, start a new room, invite them all back in, then restart. I understand that when you die, the enemies don't respawn again, but upon reaching a shrine(checkpoint, new respawn point), the penalty persists, and there is no option to restart without doing it the obviously obtuse method.

I don't recommend this for playing multiplayer.

Do note the melee combat, while superficially similar to Fromsoftware games, has more options and variations with greater potential complexity. You need not engage in the full breadth of the melee system and it is perfectly viable to play the melee combat in a very simplistic manner, but know that with sufficient experience and knowledge Nioh 2 can be incredibly flashy. 

[b]Positives[/b]
+Excellent soundtrack. Not the absolute best I've heard, as that honor goes to the MonHun series and Nier/Drakengard, but it's very much up there. 

+Very good combat. In my opinion, it's on par with Elden Ring, if not better, due to the greater variety of offense possible. If you like Masocore games, you can't go wrong with Nioh.

+Levels are large and have a lot of exploration to be done. There are side paths, collectibles/loot, and optional objectives to make exploration easier. Do note that almost every level ends in either an enemy rush or miniboss/boss fight. 

+Loot has a lot of variety, and the grace effects can be very fun, offering alternative playstyles. Do note grace effects, whether Divine or Ethereal, will not drop until higher NG+ cycles, with some of the most interesting not being available until the final NG+ cycle of ""Dream of the Nioh."" 

+Visual design is very good. Environments and colors are vibrant and show the beauty of Japan, its culture, and mythology. You won't see individual pores and skin texture like in MK11, but Nioh 2 still holds up very well in current gen. 

+Content has good breadth and isn't too repetitive. The setting is based on the Sengoku Period of Japanese history, and is fairly accurate in its events. You'll find a decent introduction to the Sengoku Period here, if somewhat dramatized, as game developers and other media creators are wont to do. DLC (note: the DLC is included in the complete edition) does dip into earlier periods of Japanese history, but it is primarily focused on resolving the main conflict within the greater Nioh 2 story. 

+Character creator seems to be able to accommodate various ethnicities decently well, and is quite fun regardless even if representation is not something important to you. [spoiler]There is a bust slider. Need I say more?[/spoiler]

+Short haired yokai-slaying tomboy waifu with beauty mark and giant scythe. With a touch of either a great f*ckin' cosmetic surgeon, or casual immortality from her guardian spirit. Speaking of waifus, there's a lot of waifus. You'll not find any absurd amounts of fanservice (No ""I can't believe it's not Hentai!"" here), but Nioh is not a prudish childrens' game either. 

[b]Negatives[/b]

-Loot can be incredibly grindy to obtain ones' desired sets. Acquiring better equipment is perhaps the endgame loop, and it can be very dispiriting at times. The loot system absolutely is a double edged sword. Frankly, I hope future Nioh games or successors make it much less grindy, even as much as I love the variety available. 

-Endgame mostly consists of very repetitive 'domains' that players farm to acquire better loot. It may very well appeal to you, but I quite dislike the endgame, once one finishes Dream of the Nioh. 

-Certain gameplay mechanics, especially Curse of the Nioh, feel very unfair. This isn't a major issue and can absolutely be overcome by adapting, as any masocore game should, but it does feel a bit excessive at times with Nioh 2. 

-Magic (and ninjutsu, by extension) deals incredibly poor direct damage to bosses. It might just be my specific build that had issues, but as far as I could tell, it was not simply because of a bad build on my part. I used a heavily magic specialized build, and even then it was only a supplement to my melee weapon at best, only useful on very specific enemies or niche situations. For bosses and most situations, I used magic to buff myself and debuff enemies while I engaged in melee combat. Outside of perhaps a Hand Cannon build, which I have not tried myself and cannot give any anecdotes or guarantees of its effectiveness, pure ranged combat is absolutely unviable. Again, this is a minor issue and does not detract much from Nioh 2 as a whole. but it is a negative nonetheless. I favor casters with reasonably competent melee combat in RPG games, and that sort of playstyle is simply not possible in Nioh 2. The closest equivalent here is perhaps a paladin sort of thing as mentioned above, where magic/ninjutsu is used as support for a melee playstyle. 

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Players interested in masocore games will get a lot of enjoyment out of Nioh 2, and find an extremely deep melee combat system that offers great potential for learning. I highly recommend Nioh 2 to anyone looking for a challenging RPG, and perhaps to look forward to future Koei Tecmo/Team Ninja games of the same type.

Overall Nioh 2 is very much like the first Nioh with things dialed to up to 100. There are more yokai, more weapons, more missions, more bosses. You won't be starved for content but this also a double-edged Katana because Nioh 2 can be very tedious and feel like a chore to beat.

Not only does the game have a skill tree for every weapon and special move combos for each weapon but it also has some boring levels and bosses that end up being unmemorable and sometimes wish I could skip. There's literally a level in the game where you face the same bosses that you've already beaten and it does tense moments when you're trying to focus I can't even remember the combos I unlocked. Thankfully I most went for passive benefits with my weapons.

Maybe I suck but Nioh 2 can feel bloated at times and I'll definitely say you should pace yourself with the game. Study enemy weaknesses, maybe skip some side missions but other than that it's pretty good.",1666061262,1666061262,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have perhaps thousands of hours playing souls, sekiro, and bloodborne on pc and consoles. I love the games and I‚Äôm pretty good at them. It took me a long time to unlearn souls tactics and learn this game- and I still suck.

Combat in nioh is deep. You will press not just all buttons on the controller all the time, but just as often you‚Äôll be pressing two at once. You‚Äôll need to intelligently execute a variety of combos all the time too. You‚Äôll parry the attacks of humans and counter those of demons. You‚Äôll block and dodge- if you suck you‚Äôll block and dodge like you do in souls and not take advantage of all your options. You have demon abilities you can equip and demons you can turn into. Also you have to manage two resources on the fly during fights: ki and anima (don‚Äôt just let anima sit wasted). I‚Äôm sure there is a bunch of stuff I haven‚Äôt learned/encountered yet too. If you‚Äôre unsure if this sounds appealing or especially interested in what I wrote here, look up a longer description of all this as I‚Äôm trying to be brief.

Once you start succeeding, even just a little, in doing all this, fights become a lot of fun and really flow.

If you get bored or tired there are I think 11 different weapons that each work really differently. And even here its not like souls or bloodborne or elden ring as, compared to the weapons in nioh, all their weapons work almost the same. Switching weapons makes fighting very different in nioh.

FromSoft is much better at designing levels though. But combat is the heart of nioh 2- well I think it is anyway. I think the levels are fine, just level design in souls is especially good.

If this sounds fun and interesting then this game is for you.

The combat honestly feels more like Ninja Gaiden than Dark Souls, other than the part where enemies can kill you in a few hits while you have non-instant heals. I recommend trying out different weapon types as you go rather than using the same 1 or 2 weapon types for the whole game - there are 11 different weapon types and they all play very differently once you learn a few active skills.

I don't love the Diablo-style loot system and think the game would have been better off without it, but it becomes a lot easier to deal with once you realize that special effects don't matter (at least until late NG+ cycles) and that you can get rid of anything you're not actively using because every piece of equipment will become obsolete within a few hours. In the offering/sell/dismantle menus, there's an option to instantly select every item of a specific rarity or lower which helps you clear things out quickly.

Another con to note is that the optional missions egregiously reuse levels and bosses. I like the idea of having shorter levels for a bit of downtime in between the full-size levels, but these just feel really lazy aside from the handful that have unique boss fights. Thankfully this isn't an issue with the story missions, and the enemy variety in general is much improved compared to Nioh 1.

The combat seriously carries the game despite its shortcomings in other areas. It's really, really fun and rewarding once you get the hang of it. If you haven't played either Nioh game I recommend skipping Nioh 1 and going straight to Nioh 2, they're extremely similar games but Nioh 2 is better in pretty much every way.",1665707830,1665707830,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only downside is that the sheer number of gameplay systems (skill trees, clans, forging, weapon types, stances, soul cores, tea sets, equipment, etc.) can be daunting at times, but luckily many of these systems are slowly introduced as you progress through the main quest.

My personal advice is to not be turned off by people mentioning the difficulty.

Too bad that makes the game unreasonably stupidly hard, to the point where I have to explain to the thousands of idiots that flood the review sections, Dark Souls is Hard, but Fair. You can avoid most things without issue, and can avoid problems with enemies by simply studying them. 

Nioh 2 is just unfair. Period. Enemies pop out of literally nowhere, I've seen enemies spawn behind shit. They aren't placed organically, they're just random placements because some Dev was too lazy to give a shit. Every enemy has a Grab move that sucked 90% of your health away, and unlike dark souls, where enemies that could grab you had to back up and wait at least a second to swing again, these crackhead ass enemies are up your butt before you even recognize what you're supposed to do. The Yokai form is useless, how do I use it? How is it used? You'd think it'd be explained better. But no. Y + B to do a special counter that won't ever inform you when it's used correctly, so your brain can't build what kind of timing you need. Y + RB or RT are useless, they're demon abilities but can't even stomp the tiniest enemies in the game? Jesus, alright, what a waste of my fucking time even trying to fuck with these useless shits.

You're constantly poisoned, which is dumb, like there's just bullshit everywhere to make you angry, because when you completely rip off a franchise without understanding what made that franchise good, you get garbage like Nioh 2, one of the most derivative experiences on the Steam Marketplace. For the love of god, remove this game from your brain, never buy it, these shitters didn't learn anything from the first Nioh, and instead of building something that was it's own, they decided to double down on the bullshit mechanics they thought worked in the first game, and made an even worse game. Ki Pulses? Fuck outta here. That shit's boring and useless. It kinda just seems like I'm sitting around with my thumb up my ass for most of the game because of the fact that you get CC'd by every single shitling enemy. Yea cool design choices here guys.

-do you like waterfowl dance? I've got good news for you, 90% of the enemies in this game have 100-0 stunlock combos in that vein, big ""just don't get hit"" vibes

-horrendous base stamina regeneration, and the game repeatedly throws massive zones at you which reduce your stamina regen to almost nothing. especially egregious when this happens in boss fights as part of an enrage mechanic. yes, I know to ki pulse.

-the worst interpretation of the diablo style loot system I've ever seen with most every enemy exploding into a loot pinata of shit you almost certainly don't care about, mind numbing and unrewarding, although the armor and weapon aesthetics are pretty nice.

-linear map design with very little room for alternative approaches, apparently map reuse becomes frequent as the game progresses.

-nothing to write home about story wise, but that's probably not the selling point that most people care about for this.

-certain skills feel unresponsive to use (Greased Lightning on Hatchets, for example), input buffering feels... off. I can't quite place why

-gating skills based on whether or not you've completed a stage. I get restricting this so players can't just max out one skill tree off the bat, but this feels like the laziest way to approach this restriction.

The combat and skill systems in Nioh 2 are without a doubt excellent, but if you don't fall in love with this combat quickly you'll probably just find yourself frustrated and bored with the game's myriad flaws before you're even allowed to access most of the fun skills and flashy equipment.

You can improve your character and gear but it makes no difference cause the demons can just cleave through that, and god forbid if you're fighting multiple Yokai at once. The combat was clearly not designed to fight multiple enemies at a time, as the lock on is awful at that and your moves are clearly meant for 1v1 engagement, though the devs decided to plaster the game with crowded enemies in tight spaces cause that's what they want to make it artificially difficult. There's also a ton of dropped input, you could spam the buttons for your item shortcuts and Yokai abilities and nothing will happen.

The game's combat's depth and complexity is already enough to make it hard yet fun, but instead of making you reading your opponents moves and capitalizing on mistakes and openings with your own techniques; it's either dodge this move and do 2 basic attacks twice or get 2-shotted due to a jank hitbox attack.

Instead of adressing and fixing the balancing issues however Team Ninja decided to make them MUCH MUCH WORSE. The first playthrough is even easier than the first game thanks to the new mechanics like Yokai attacks and Burst counters (like parrying in Ds except not working half the time if you choose the phantom type) Then ng+ and the DLCS come along where the base game stays at a MOSTLY balanced level but the DLCS JUST LIKE the first game are filled with broken enemies and bosses where you HAVE to brute force them with pretty high level gear to even have a chance. The balancing is so much worse that the first game that i was getting two shotted by the first DLC boss of Darkness In the Capital at NEW GAME DIFFICULTY WITH HEAVY ARMOR. So begins the grind and farm fiesta BUT unlike the first game the loot you find is MUCH MUCH lower leveled than the difficulty you are in. Dream Of the Demon (NG++) is supposed to have a cap of +20 level weapons and the NEXT difficulty (NG+++) was giving me LEVEL 19 all the time in the first few regions. In the end after getting at least +22 weapons (that DECIMATED ng++ in the first game since they were leveled for ng+++ content) WERE TICKLING BOSSES AT THE NG++ DIFFICULTY. They seriously screwed the balance SO BAD that i was having 10 minute fights with weapons that were supposed to OUTLEVEL THE DIFFICULTY I WAS IN.

I have played this somewhere else before steam ones, so my play time may not reflect it. 

A lot of people may compare this to Souls-like, but to newcomers who are considering, let me just tell you it is not. Don't think it as a Souls-like and you won't be disappointed easily. 

[h1]Overview[/h1] 
Nioh 2 doesn't have the a beautiful world like Souls game, so that sense of wonder and curiosity as you explore the world is almost non-existent. The world is delivered in stage format, and unfortunately, the world is ugly. If you have played Elden Ring and was amazed by the vistas, you will not find it here. 
What it has, is a combat system, that is a little similar to Souls in the sense of roll, potion, light & heavy attack, but that's about it. In reality, the combat is much much more deep than Souls-like, you can equip various weapons that have very different style and a skill tree for each weapons, 3 combat stances with every stance customizable, 4 special demon powers, demon transformations, and an array of Ninjutsu and Magic abilities. Dodge roll is weaker in Nioh, you are expected to block fast attacks and dodge slower ones, you can also strengthen your blocks and do block counters. 

The name of the game is practice and grind. You level up, farm gear, beat demons, repeat.

So if you are looking for a satisfying systematic combat that provides a lot of exciting challenges, then this game is for you.

[h1]Pros [/h1]
The combat. The combat system is really really deep. Just as it's world building holds no candle to Souls-like, Souls-like combat holds no candle to Nioh's. While the system is complex and can sound intimidating, the game actually ease you up to the systems very well. The game doesn't let you access all the skills at once, and introduces each mechanic slowly throughout the campaign, so that you are never overwhelmed and forgot the controls. By the end of the campaign, you will have a solid grasp of all the skills that you can employ, and then you realize, it's only the beginning, for it is now time to go into a new mode and become a master. 

With the amount of monsters and bosses, you will never be short of challenges, and the battles are really exciting. You can also coop, which is amazing.

The character models are really great, the amount of customizations and details available is incredible. It allows you to create characters as pretty or handsome as you want, not unlike other game which have hideous character customizations. Getting the right fashion going is half of the game. 

[h1]Cons [/h1]
The world design is ugly, the lighting is ugly, there is not a moment that makes me want to stop and look at the scenery, in fact i kept on looking and thinking ""why is it this ugly?"". It's like someone who painted only with mud, if i have an analogy, Skyrim looks better than Nioh 2. 
Everything except humanoid characters look ugly, yes even the demons. Stages are reused and repeated all throughout missions. The world feels very ""stage"" like, it doesn't feel like a world that the characters live in. Only the final area feels slightly different and better, everything else felt the same and bland. The story is also delivered in a very boring way. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
The combat is like crack, a deep system you only wish a Souls game could adapt. But if you don't come to Nioh for the combat, then this game has nothing for you.",1655815576,1664344659,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

It is a souls-like, but only in the sense that you have a stamina (or rather, ki) bar, you have ""bonfires"" where you replenish your heath and items, and your health bar will often deplete to zero.

The game operates on a ""mission"" system, as it consists of a hub area / map from which you can access different facilities, like shop, forging, training, etc. and from where you can embark on missions. Missions are mostly linear with a few detours here and there and only one pbjective: you drop in at one end of the map, you have to get to the other end, survive the final encounter of the mission. Sometimes its a boss or bosses, sometimes waves of enemies. There are unlockable shortcuts during the maps, those will bring you joy.

When you jump in, the game will probably seem convoluted. Read and complete the tutorials, its better to get familiar with the controls during the tutorial. The game has layers upon layers of mechanics, items, skills and equipment. Further layers will be added as you move forward in the game and, eventually, the new game cycles. Your character build will be complex and, in my opinion, it is an absolute joy to fine tune it and see it work in action as you unlock and add more and better stuff to it. It might be important to note that farming for certain pieces of equipment will be an important aspect of the game if you want to have a specific build. The loot system is heavily RNG based, but you can temper your equipment at the forge, changing certain traits and properties of it. It is a necessity to keep your armour and weapons up to date, otherwise your sword will hit like a wet noodle and even the weakest yokai will potentially one-shot you.

You will probably often say ""what the hell just happened"" as your soul is freed from the mortal coil yet again. The game is challenging but it is fair and straightforward in its difficulty, you can bet your ass that every enemy has a weakness which you can exploit. In my experience, combat rewards two things: agression and picking the right moment to commit to combos. The game heavily punishes turtling, as enemies will have time to regain their ki (stamina) and, on higher difficulties, even their health.
Enemies are diverse and interesting. It feels good every time to flawlessly kill an enemy you have mastered. Bosses are unique, with their own abilities and strategies.

Now, artistic pros and cons.I like the animations and models a lot, the majority of weapons and armours look really good. The story is mostly weak and predictable with the occasional high note, but you are probably not here for the story anway. The soundtrack has many memorable pieces, some of them I listen to regularly. I really like the setting, the time period the game takes place in. I like to read the encyclopedia entries about the yokai, the different guardian spirits and the (mostly) historical figures.

TLDR: Good game, complex, has meaningful endgame content that remains so throughout the new game+ cycles. The sense of progress and improvement is satisfying. Game is hard but fair. Good music, (mostly) cringe dialogues",1664325009,1664325009,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am also getting old now (~50), but as an old-school gamer (Doom/Quake 1.0), I rely on instincts, practice and  muscle-memory, the last of which is unfortunately fading, along with my biological clock. But this game  - like Sekiro, another Souls-evolved  game -  challenged me to stay young and nimble. Nioh2 has a marginally gentler learning curve, though;  more stretched out, with several 'get ready' missions. 
My review below may be a bit different from the bulleted 'Pro/Con lists' that one normally reads on Steam reviews (and please forgive the ramblings of an old man). 
In my view Nioh 2 teaches the following life lessons for younger gamers: 

- So many choices! at an early stage/ young age - You won't know how to succeed later in the game/life till you try a few things
- (weapons/ninjutsu/magic) and practice/fail. If you can discover what works, then refine, stay focused and build out stats with what works for you. If you can't, persevere, you will find your path in the myriad possibilities. It took me 8 weapons (and 10 hours) before I narrowed down on Kusarigama as my weapon of choice before I got to Episode 2. BTW, It also took me 15 years IRL to find a job i enjoyed. 

- Enemies are life's uncertainties. They come in all forms and keep you on your toes. The secret is to You need to work out timings, combinations of  moves, IRL, enemies are but your friends, they teach you something you didn't know (yet) 

- Dying is ‚ÄòOK‚Äô - The game is (un)forgiving depending on your perspective, i.e., it gives you a second chance - albeit with no amrita aka, earnings. This is food for thought ( ‚Äúold person‚Äù thinking again) ‚Äì if one were to die with a chance of being brought back to life ‚Äì would you want to come back as you were, or have a chance to start from scratch? 

- Perseverance is key. Much has been written about this by people younger and more learned than myself, so keep trying till you can(not) succeed. 

- Enjoy the view. Don‚Äôt keep rushing to the next enemy/life situation. Take a while and twirl your camera around. Look at the artwork, enjoy the music, take a breather, before the next Yokai smashes you down. 

Thank you for indulging me. Enjoy the rest of your life, stay true to your course and the people who matter to you üòä

Well no $hit this game plays like a Souls game. It‚Äôll maybe take a seasoned Souls vet 2-3 hours to gain a firm enough grip on these mechanics to assert themselves in this game‚Äôs world as a worthy threat to all the game‚Äôs bosses. However, the presumption that this game is in any way a Souls alternative, a variation on the Souls genre, a game that has ‚Äúproven itself‚Äù as a Souls contender, or, most disrespectfully, a colorful, anime, arcadey Souls clone, is very dangerous and damaging to Team Ninja‚Äôs hard earned reputation. It is the spreading of straight up misinformation. 

I‚Äôm not sure where this lie began. It makes no sense to me because the Ninja Gaiden games enjoyed immense popularity throughout the PlayStation/PlayStation 2 era. How was it then that once Demon‚Äôs Souls came out, people did not immediately pin it as what it was: a more grim dark, deliberately paced iteration on the Gaiden Series. That From Soft was at least influenced by Team Ninja as they made Demon‚Äôs Souls is not an opinion. It‚Äôs a fact. 

Ninja Gaiden announced itself as an elite take on the fighting RPG genre in 2004. Up until then, there was no game like it that demanded such patience, focus, and dexterity from players. It was hard. The first level alone was a nightmare. The way it introduced players into the world and educated players on how to succeed through throwing players in the pool and not caring if they drowned was somewhat of an innovation. But be clear, Souls did not invent or even reinvent it. In fact, the process was more or less copy, pasted, and adjusted for Demon‚Äôs Souls. 

Demon Soul‚Äôs, being a game that came out in 2009, had arrived after [b] 5[/b] more Gaiden games were released. 

So for Nioh to borrow from elements of From Soft games is of false equivalence to From Soft‚Äôs initial having been directly inspired by Gaiden itself. 

There‚Äôs a funny moment in Nioh where this floating goat is following you around and it notices one of those elevators that you step on the square on the center in order to trigger (just like there is in every souls game). Thing is, this contraption has been in every Team Ninja game since 2004. The goat then says

It terms of how hard the game is here is how i would rank them,

1. Sekiro (The hardest by a long way)
2. Nioh 2
3. Elden Ring/ DS3

Some of the bosses in Nioh 2 are really hard but there are builds and also multiplayer to help you out. Sekiro on the other hand, you just have to get good at it.

Honestly this game is really fun and it isnt too hard or punishing. Saying that i died on that snake boss like 50+ times and then one shot the next boss without taking damage. SO things that seem hard to one person maybe easy for another.

Overall still very enjoyable. Definitely worth the price.

Bosses seem to scale depending on how many players there are as well, so the balanced play is not an issue. Plenty of build/weapon customization combat options are available and the cutscenes and little add-ins do very well at showcasing your character as the main character without subtracting from having several interesting NPCs.

This is a combination of Diablo 2's loot system with better crafting, an obvious Souls inspiration and an out-of-this-world robust combat system.

If you think Dark Souls' combat is just a rhythm game, then this is the game for you, because the combat system has a lot of depth to it. Lot's of special moves, stances, yokai abilities, ninjutsu, onmyo (japanese paper-talisman) magic etc. master all of this with weapon- and even guardian spirit switching mid-combo and you get combat that almost resembles DMC sometimes.

Add the sheer amount of build variety to that and you get a game that's easily not just THE best souls game in existence but also the best aRPG. Only thing it lacks is probably online PvP, because multiplayer is pretty much just coop.

Graphics are pretty, hair looks like it had 3 shampoos and 5 balms applied, a nice ultra-realism artstyle. It's set in 16th century feudal fantasy-Japan, so you get the history and it also gives you the mythology. Don't worry, the story isn't as convoluted and difficult to understand as in Nioh 1 anymore, and the 2 games are only sort-of connected in the epilogue through Nioh 1's player character, William.

It's a good bang for your buck too: 1st playthrough with all side missions completed took me about 100 hours. It had some issues at launch (kb/m button prompts, some performance issues), but they're all resolved and it's a proper PC game now.",1619537353,1663059386,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I understand the trend and how companies are using that as a template for creating more games. I don't hate them even if they add no creativity. Nioh 2 isn't one of those games. It adds plenty of new mechanics and is very different. As someone said, a bit more Ninja Gaiden style.

Now with all that there are cheap kills (I accepted them), there is a very steep learning curve (I don't know how people who didn't play Nioh 1, would deal with this), lots of enemies pretty much 2 shoting you. etc etc

What really took things to a new level was that I beat a boss I was having problems with, I then got to the next part of the game (map screen), quit out the game and then when I restarted I was back at the save point before the boss. Lots of people have had their data deleted randomly, and things like that.

Nope. That's enough for a negative review because for a game that 'prides' itself on being very hard, you can't have crap  like that happening. It wasn't a bug because I tested it out again and it's flaw in the system and it's a flaw which has come because they want to make sure people don't quit out to save their expendible items.

BUT. The story is forgettable and useless, the missions repeat a LOT and all the characters are recycled. And after you finish the first NG, the game becomes pretty much grinding for gear. And you need to that for the achievemnts. So yeah. BS. And a lot of the missions are just boss rushes, and shit like that. Which I enjoy as a challenge (read: MOD), and appreciate it being there, but making it part of the game's completion... cheap. I really didn't need to fight Otekamaru 30x for an achievement. And the scaling and balancing are absolutely bullshit too. And, check my profile, I'm a souls veteran. I'm used to pain and difficulty. This game is NOT difficult (got plat on both). It's just annoying. The scaling jumps between areas is just ridiculous. You're SUPPOSED to take on missions with a recommended level like 100+ levels above what a noob would be at that stage. Which to me screams ""GRIND FOR A LONG TIME just so our telemetry show us long hours spent on the game and the studio pays us money"". Or you speedrun the game and become an Otekamaru slayer god at the cost of no fun at all in the game. Plus the usual BS mechanics - every enemy gets an unblockable move, every time you're running for your souls everybodyt is twice more aggressive, everything can pretty much insta kill you at any level... the list goes on. Seriously. Go play a FROM soft game if you're into souls, or go play a Capcom hack and slash if that's more your thing.

It takes the dark souls combat and improves and expands on it in many ways.
It also takes the diablo-style exciting but random loot-casino and fixes it with the ability to adjust all aspects of items at the exactly right pace towards the end of the game, completely eradicating the typical issue with that loot-system.

The devs are aware of the strengths and weaknesses of their game. Obviously the story is just some random samurai-demon basic fantasy and they keep that to a skipable minimum, to get right back to the good part: the combat.

Only real negative thing is, how easy it is to break the game when using the less player skill dependent combat styles like magic or ninjutsu. While initially not as easy as in Nioh 1, it allows for even more ridiculous combinations. The saving grace here is the fact, that it's easy to avoid and still possible to have a perfectly fine and challenging experience.

All in all a fantastic balance between supplying weaboos with their anime and monstergirl cutscenes etc., unskilled players with crutches like magic to avoid actually having to play and gamers with rewarding and challenging melee combat.",1662224480,1662224480,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game is pretty challenging but rewarding. With beautiful graphics, lots types of weapons and good looking characters, it is really enjoy.

Default settings for character creation is pretty nice. I was so please about my character. Also there are lots of spirit waifu, yokai waifu, human waifu, community waifu(waifu code), which make your journey even more enjoyable.

Controller is definitely recommended since developers kinda don't know how keyboard-mouse works and default key setting is clunky as hell.

There are plenty of stuffs like ""how certain perks works"", ""what is means of main weapon"", ""what are use of mortal soul cores"" that game didn't explain well. So players need do find some guides from internet.

New game plus is too grindy. When player finally reach the ""Dream of the Wise"" level, ethereal item will start to drop randomly. The problem with the ethereal item is that player can't forge with materials. So the only way to get ethereal item is to farm. To get ethereal items with decent effects is like totally gambling.

Also some boss design is so cheap that I was get so frustrated.
Here is how they make game hard:
A). make enemy health 10 times of player's
B). make enemy attack damage 10 times of player's
C). make enemy almost never run of stamina(Ki) and also pretty aggressive
D). make enemy almost never get stun
With these game settings, players have to learn enemy's move patterns with little room for mistakes.After beating these kind of boss, I feel like I am wasting my time because its actually take no skill to do but patience and time. And everyone can do it if they know the boss move pattern.

B.) Trick Nioh 2 into running on Directx11
     1.) Go to X:\Windows\System32
     2.) Find xinput1_3.dll
     3.) Copy and paste said xinput1_3.dll
     4.) Rename the copy to ""xinput1_4.dll

And for some reasons, game keep crashing(black screen), my solution is:
A.) find config.xml
     1.) C:\Users\user\Documents\KoeiTecmo\NIOH2
B.) change your display mode to borderless - for some reason the full screen is crashing the game on load.
     1.) <DISP_MODE>BORDER LESS</DISP_MODE>

very pretty visuals, some questionable design choices though (especially with armour and weapon sets, it can get ridiculous and silly)

pretty nice story that mixes historical with fantasy and mythology. It certainly doesn't break any boundaries and is quite generic, however there are standout moments (william :D ) that make it enjoyable, or in other cases, annoying and frustrating, you also have no control over the story.

+Improves upon Nioh 1's combat, which was already the smoothest and deepest of any Soulslike game. Now there's a system where you can collect the abilities of demons and equip up to 3 of them at a time. There are 75 of these in total, and collecting them all is a lot of fun. 
+Every weapon is not only cool, but viable. They come with a heavy, medium, and light stance that can be switched between at any time, and each stance completely changes a weapon's set of moves. While I have my favorites, I felt the need to master every weapon because of how great all of them are to play.
+Tons of character customization. Every piece of equipment can be made to look like anything you've already found. You also have the option to transform into many of the characters that appear throughout the story, in case you don't feel like worrying about your look.
+Significantly better level design than the first game. Missions can last for hours depending on how much time you spend exploring their numerous hidden / optional areas.
+Features the only New Game + mode I've ever taken seriously. There are 4 NG+ playthroughs to unlock, and each add entirely new mechanics, remixed enemy placements, and some enemies even get new attacks.
+Generally good soundtrack and sound design.
+A fun way to learn about Japanese folklore.
+Great overall art direction.

Do you love every Fromsoftware's Souls game, especially DaS2, or just plainly hate yourself? Then I have a game for you: Nioh2
Yes, I do believe nioh2 is close to das2 with its bs, like its difficult, but more often than not its just being cheap, like increasing poise, reach, recovery time and ''Living Weapon''. Which only makes me beat their bs tactics with my own bs tactics, that sucks, since it leads to a boring match of me baiting an attack and mashing the same move over n over until one of us gives. Also the game does throws a match, like its pittying me or something. Example: Dojo, was in the dojo with a weapon I sucked at and as you could guess, cpu was mopping the floor with me (still think those swipes couldnt reach me, but whatever) for like 10 matches and on the 11th one it was nowhere near as aggressive, making my victory feel hollow.
I will still keep playing it, but I just dont think the common gamer would enjoy it. But for the rest sure go for it, it has enough changes to not feel like a complete copy paste from the 1st one and the biggest plus: it doesnt have those stupid arrow shower from the last Nioh dlc (god I hated that mission).",1660947770,1660947770,False,5,1,0.445550799369812012,0,True,False,False

They need to go back and play the games they are trying to emulate. They are pretty close to having something great it just misses the mark.

The combat itself is good. It just takes me out of the immersion of the game when I can use the same weapon an enemy did and do far less damage. The combat mechanics are solid. Why develop robust combat systems when almost everything kills you effortlessly. Everything devolves into strike first and dodge. 

Then you get to bosses designed to counter your strengths. That methodology doesn't work for you though. Not until much later in the game. Your weapons are pathetically weak. Every boss is a dance where you better perform your steps exactly in time. While the boss can swing and accidentally kill you. You have to balance your resources. Pay attention to the environment etc etc. The boss only has to outlast you and they never get tired. 

I will commend Team Ninja on trying to improve on the genre. 

I wish more game devs would go back and play Kengo: Masters of Bushido on ps2. Don't try to copy it but learn what it has to teach. Weapons hit hard, but for both you and your opponent.

why i place a negative review? i cant even have the keyboard configuration that i want.

this game is 100% made for consoles. it started with hard issues when it was ported to pc, and still basic stuff fail hard to work properly.

the game for pc is for the highest of the highest of masoquists that exist in the world
you want to activate a simple skill in one of 4 ways of dealing damage (fighting stances, magic\traps, ultimate form, and copied pokemon skill)? here, have a totally diferent button configuration for each one.
want to fire an arrow? here, press 4 buttons. my configuration for using ranged weapons doesnt have the space button for anything at all. shooting was locked to space bar. great.

enemy hits you? you are stagered............fuk you

why make a game hard simply by hard controls?
43 DIFERENT BUTTON INPUTS,  for simple tasks not counting combos. some you have to press 2 buttons to do the desired thing.
example: this game wants you to switch between 4 stances, high (hard hits), medium (balanced movement and medium dmg), low (low dmg high movement, lower stamina ki consumption), and the starting position for ""Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki"" (i wish).

you press 2 buttons to change stance on pc. thats it. you did nothing, you didnt move, or attack, it was just a static transition of a stance.
how to improve this?: heavy attack starts anything that would be associated with high stance, medium for medium stance, a dash movement for low stance

sprint???? what?????.........we have sprint??? were?how? keybindings say nothing about it, but there is sprint. hidden basic mechanics? really????
 (ill say it again: ""hidden"" and ""basic"")
is the game not hard enough?

(edit: Press and hold Dash button to RUN, on the controller or keyboard.)

2 tapped by 1st boss with the atks homing on you after you dodge when it is right to hit the ground, but somehow the atk teleported to my head

With that said I enjoyed the first game quite a bit so any improvements are great! This plays more like a huge expansion rather than a full fledged sequel. 

I think my biggest issue is the level design. The levels can get a little repetive after a while. They all have the same structure. The first game also had this problem, and I wish it was addressed here.

Except that warrior is probably ill with tuberculosis or some other severe respiratory disease, otherwise there is no explanation why it near-suffocates after swinging a weapon for a few times or performing several dodges. You have a demon-form. Except it invariably has to be saved for end stages of boss fights because form activation gauge builds incredibly slowly. Basically everywhere the lore implies abundance of power, your character can only demonstrate weakness. The only abundance you can really have in this game is grinding.

There is a huge fighting system with multiple types of martial weapons that each can be used in three stances. Each stance comes with different moves, paces, stamina consumption, damage output etc... Who the f... had an idea that fighting happens this way must be living in some kind of alternate reality and has never practiced any kind of real world martial art. Generally you will end up choosing two weapons and one or two stances and throw all the other complexity away, because there will be no time looking up key sequences when you have to doge and grind the enemy.

There is also a manual lock-on system that has to be used to land more than a few hits. Fails in epic fashion when you get jumped by a group of enemies that start hammering you all at the same time. You have locked on enemy A, oh look enemy B is attacking you now. You have dodged and relocked  on B, oh look C is here. You are trying to concentrate on A and just doge the rest? Not happening because you are circling the locked enemy and cant maneuver in a normal fashion.

As an added bonus, there are high ledges (instant death on fall) and deep water (instant drowning) everywhere. Packed with enemies you have to doge. And no borders to prevent you from dodging from the ledge or into the water. Why? Because....

Honestly I see another game marked ""dark souls like"" i'm just throwing it into a ban-list instantly. Why waste time grinding arbitrary nonsense when there are far better things to do.",1659138192,1659138192,False,3,1,0.438175022602081299,0,True,False,False

In my personal opinion, this game is harder than dark souls 3 in certain areas, such as certain bosses don't have a massive move-set, they all do disgusting amounts of damage, but once you find your groove, your load-out, and favorite weapon combo, the game is rewarding like none other, sure you'r the ""main character"" but its cool how you don't have ""plot armor"" in a sense, you constant effort to become better at the game, stronger, and smarter, means that you build the foundation of your plot armor through trial and error, skill building, and mental fortitude not to give up. here are some pros and cons that aren't very in depth but get to the point.
CONS 
~co-op issues and difficulties when not working properly
~occasional responsiveness issues such as when using items, or items showing the use animation and not being consumed
~occasional online stability can be wack but can smooth out, honestly isn't to bad as long as you have decent wifi
~the stun locks are real so don't get to aggressive lmao
~there is no open world but*
PROS
~there is plenty of exploration to be had in most missions, roughly 80% of the missions have some kind of exploration to be had*
~great smooth gameplay
~beautiful atmosphere and visuals (if your pc and or laptop isn't slow like mine, still pretty tho)
~dark and gloomy areas perfect for a souls-like
~great boss variety
~great enemy variety
~endless amounts of replay-ability due to the huge amounts of weapons and different play styles they give you
~ really everything else is great about the game, if your bad you can grind, but you definitely don't have to grind a lot like in the souls games, and once you get good enough the game becomes a boss rush game just like the souls games 

Bonus info: every weapon type has a skill tree to add combos and other benefits such as extra damage on certain skills obtained from the different weapon types. You play as a Yokai Shiftling (half human half demon) and in term you get Yokai abilities and a whole skill tree on your Yokai shiftling part. There are crazy amounts of enemies going from human to giant bosses, all the way to a weird turtle boi that wanna smack em cheeks. The stance system offers many different ways to play, high stance = damage and low mobility, mid stance = medium damage with decent mobility, and you guessed it, low stance = low damage but extreme mobility.

there is plenty more to be said about this game, but this is a rough gist of it all, if you wanna be some bada** samurai with a story that is amazing cover to cover, and a great challenge that makes success feel truly rewarding rather than playing a game on easy mode your whole life, then this is the game for you, worth every penny.
1.if you wan't someone who's also fairly new to this game hmu, I'm always on this game when im not working
2.this game has every confusing bits to it, but once you get a grasp on it, its extremely rewarding just to notice that you have memorized a fairly complex system
3. I'm pretty sure there is no form of pvp other than fighting someones ai (when you or someone else dies, you leave a red grave in other worlds which you or someone else can touch and then fight the person who had died, if you win, you receive equipment, items, and ochoko cups which are used to summon ai companions and irl pepes to help you if you find yourself in either a pickle or a lonesome boredom
4.there are 2 forms of co-op, 1 you randomly join someones world as a ""phantom"" like in the ds series +elden ring which is also linked to the ds series, just gotta read find print and find the ""secret boss"" 2 you do an expedition where everyone has a ""shared health meter"" if it drains completely the mission is a failure, if it drains in a boss fight, the last man standing can clutch it out...or die, and if the mission fails, you can retry with the same group but for less rewards, both versions of the co-op are rewarding, if you need a level and your not to sure if the next area will stick a plunger up your a** and stick you to a mountain side as it laughs and waits for you to fall just to loose all your amrita (souls) then it's a good change of pace, also, if you solo most souls games like me, co-op is a nice change of pace, watching an ally fly off the said cliff side can be worth a chuckle, and overcoming a boss with double/tripple the health bar (more allies=more enemy health, its balanced) can be mentally rewarding on its own, plus getting a lot of gear for selling, and dismantling to craft better gear feels good as well.....long story short it's a really great game for what it's worth.",1658976231,1658976231,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game IS good, especially combat-wise, and does a lot of things better than the first, but it also does a lot extremely wrong. Having more options isn't always better, especially when the main problems are with the main STORY, overall BOSS design, and no longer 100%-ing skill trees which is contrary to the first game, in my opinion. 
Yes, the first game's story did suffer from bein' fairly disjointed at times, but comparing how this game continues along you'd think it had never read a finished sentence in its life. 
Also having extremely dull boss fights with yokai which made it a chore to push through, especially now that draining its stamina is the only real viable strategy on whether or not you're able to actually interrupt them and do any kind of damage or not. 
Lastly you can no longer 100% a weapon tree as it apparently favors decisive decision making over all else leading to only half of it being available when maxed out. This weird decision severely hinders experimentation, even though you are able to respec later on and have multiple versions of a character's skill list to choose from, which is not the optimal option.
 
I'm at least glad that character customization is fantastic and is definitely an extreme highlight with the 'Ninja Team flare', but I gotta be honest, you really can't do better than the chad, William Adams, from the first game.

Again, it's a good game, a GREAT one even, but I would recommend the first 10 outta 10 game to newcomers and if after finishing THAT one maybe get this 7 on 10 sequel whenever it's on sale.",1658400916,1658400916,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has a steep learning curve for new players to the series. Players have to manage their stamina, special abilities, and health meters.  As well as a three stance system that provides unique playing styles for each weapon.

Add creating your own character and a combat system that allows you to be quick and agile, dodging incoming attacks and quickly countering to blocking and dealing massive damage. Also has a magic and ninja skills to add flavor to your build.

There is end game content as well as multiplayer for replay value. Multiplayer is pretty fun but you can get in a room where a higher level player runs through and one shots everything. I haven‚Äôt had this happen a lot but it does happen.

You start off weak, getting 2-3 shot by enemies and taking a while to kill bosses in terms of damage. By the end of the game, with you all leveled and geared up, you are now getting one shot by the half-second instakill grab attacks from bosses, and your kill times have gotten significantly worse. (I was following a meta build, by the way. LOL!) Enemy stat inflation is way worse than Elden Ring for example. Games where leveling up is just to tread water, like Nioh, instead of getting stronger, like in most games with leveling, shouldn't have leveling in the first place.

The gameplay got repetitive around 60% through the game. There aren't enough moves for the weapon I chose (Katana), and a lot of the moves are either not good, or you can't use them because you need to use certain moves to break through enemy ki inflation. (For example, I was stuck using Kick the entire game because of the ridiculous ki system in the game meaning you can't damage enemies for more than chip damage until you break their ki bar, except they have a bigger ki bar than you, that regenerates faster than yours (which you need to deplete to drain theirs), and can attack with no ki (you can't). See the problem? Also unlocking different abilities is really not good, with arbitrary xp and mission gates that only make you grind longer, instead of anything meaningful like improving your skills through beating a challenging boss.

Every single level feels the same and the environments suck. Looter games where you get a billion different pieces of gear that all suck are very tiresome, too. Once you've played through the first level, you've played through the entire game, essentially.

The game would have been much better if the player character was able to do any amount of damage greater than chip level to most enemies, and/or not get 2 shot by every enemy the entire game following the appropriate level curve, and/or do anything close to the cheap stuff enemies do (the best I got for you is lightning talisman + sloth to make enemies pretty slow. woohoo...) Also either let the player demon counter all the bullshit moves (such as the ridiculous late game grab attacks, or various boss moves like the golden armor spear guy who hits you 100 times which will simultaneously deplete your ki and kill you in under a quarter of a second with no counter besides dodging in a very specific way which is not fun nor gives the player any gameplay choice.)

I thought the game had potential at the start, and don't want to play it again after finishing my first playthrough. It starts at 7 or 8/10 and ends at a solid 3/10. Destroying a game in terms of its design and gameplay for the sole sake of making it challenging (the game actively fucking you over just to waste your time through dying after a 10 minute long perfectly executed boss fight with a single mistake isn't fun or engaging, Team Ninja.) is a horrible thing to do.

What a waste of a potentially good game.

Sincerely,
someone who beat Malenia naked at SL1. (Elden Ring wasn't very good either and full of artificial difficulty, by the way. Not trying to say ER was any better than this game.)",1657760157,1657760157,False,1,2,0.481927722692489624,0,True,False,False

Let's get some things out of the way:
- I've only played New Game, not NG+(+++) or DLC, so my opinion is based on that.
- This game is ""difficult"" as the tags suggest, yes, mainly the first 3 or 4 levels, but the rest I felt like a curve going up and down. First boss took me 71 tries, but most bosses took me around 20-5 tries, some first try, and some just a couple.
- Concerning the ""Souls-like"", it is souls-like in regard of: 
*How levels work, you got your shrines (bonfire/lamp), if you die you wake up in the last shrine, enemies respawn (except mini bosses).
*You get ""Amrita"" from defeating enemies, and when you die you lose them, until you go back and touch your grave.
*Levels have shortcuts you can open.
That is how I feel having played Demon's Souls and BloodBorne previously.

Apart from that, it has a very different feel, with how combat works, equipment and items. People have likened it to Diablo, but I have personally not played that.
I think of this as Ninja Gaiden, but with stamina bar and less chaotic overall (it can get chaotic at some points), and lots of loot!

This is a martial art action game with many styles and weapons to master, you'll feel strong and you'll have many tricks up your sleeves as you progress. But yes the first 3 bosses especially kicked my butt lol

Character creation is really good with many options, and more you unlock later on. You can change your look anytime and save and load or upload your customization, and download other people's creations. One of the main points I decided to give this a try.

I also feel I have to mention, this game has a really good Photo Mode, it has both an in-game Photo Mode and Nvidia Ansel, if you're into virtual photography like myself, this is a great pick!

My two main gripes about this game are:
- Training Mode is limited to a few enemy types. I wished to practice against all enemies.
- Shrines/checkpoints being a bit far from boss encounters, it adds nothing to the challenge, just wasting time, as each time you die, you have to again run across a bridge or climb a few ladders and evade a few small enemies.

Another part of the game that im enjoying is the bosses. While they are hard to defeat (at the point i'm at), its not insanely impossible to the point where you have to have the control of a robot to defeat a boss.

However, it squanders all this good will by simply being punishing for the sake of it.
Aside from the camera employing snap points, making the game overly clunky, you would be hard pressed to find an enemy in the game (no matter your level) that can't two shot you.
That's not necessarily a bad thing in general. On the other hand, many enemies have tough movesets to master. Moreover, this developer has a fetish for unavoidable ambushes and spam. I can't overstress how spammy this game is.
Combine absurd levels of spam with the complex movesets to grasp with the ridiculous damage and you just get the definition of artificial difficulty. Bloating stats and numbers doesn't really equate to mechanical difficulty/depth, and that's a shame because the game actually does have mechanical depth, which is already hard enough to master without the stupid design decisions i outlined.

The meat and bones of the game though are just an absolute masterpiece. Crisp, clean and responsive controls and combat that is also fast and fluid while still maintaining weight with each swing with each weapon. Many different styles and many different weapons means many different ways to play.

The combat on its own is easy enough to understand and the game can be played through with just the fundamental understandings of combat, but there is just absolutely thick and juicy meat in terms of depth of combat from parries to counters to iframes, it's all there.

Excellent visuals. Dark and dreary landscapes, war-torn lands and ravaged villages painted in dark, depressing and drab palette all juxtapose besides the colorful oni and visual effects that come with clashing with them.

The challenge, the Japanese mythology, they're all there if you're familiar with Nioh, but it is improved upon by bundles and bundles. An absolute masterpiece of a game that proves Team Ninja's development maturity dating all the way back to Ninja Gaiden. Excellent, excellent, excellent. This whole game is just on another level.

Say you beat a really really fun mid game boss, and in games like Dark Souls, you'd have to beat the game, and get to that point to fight them again (in no way a game breaker for the DS series, but sometimes you wish you could just fight the boss just *one* more time). In Nioh 2, old missions are still doable on the same save, even if you beat it. And if you think you'd be too strong for that mission, making it boring, you can opt to drop your level to enjoy the difficulty while not being *too* broken.

The difficulty spikes in places that have no reason for it. Especially some bosses tend to punish mistakes hard, leaving you very little room between respawns to really get to learn them. This, after a hard level that, in the very least, was beaten methodically, to a satisfying degree. Thankfully the Nioh series has a hard-on for that DS1 interconnectivity, meaning that usually you're a sprint away from trying a boss again. Sadly, they still like to include a few enemies in your route. And sometimes, those enemies are frustrating and will nip at your health right before the boss gate. That never feels good, especially when the shortcut is obviously designed to put you in sprinting distance from the boss.

Some skills are blatantly better than others in their class, to the point that the enemies start punishing you for trying to use the bad ones, while all of them sound good in their description. You're quite punished for not finding the meta before you commit to a skill point, because you can only respec those points outside of a mission.

Some weapons downright get shafted unless you're a God-tier player who compensates for all their serious shortcomings. Axe and Odachi definitely feel like they need some help, as enemies only get faster as the game goes on, and slow weapons require actual foresight to land good hits.

The biggest difference with the DS series is how you face a challenge. In DS, you learn and observe the enemies, routes and tactics. In Nioh, you can start with that, but ultimately you'll need to rely on Cheese to make encounters less painful. Cheese and overleveling are the only solid, consistent answers to any problem, which cheapens every victory where you had to rely on them. Magic to slow down a boss to the point that their moveset is irrelevant, pluck at their health using DoT's whenever possible, heavily overpowered weapon skills that can easily dominate. There's not one answer for every problem, but rather an array of solutions to which a few can usually solve any problem. In short, personal skill is far less relevant than cheese. And if the only answer to a boss is cheese, then that boss is inherently designed poorly.

This could all have gone over better if the opponents were written better. Sadly, the story muddles along and those hard-won bosses have a history or monologueing where there's no satisfaction in victory. Either you're supposed to feel bad or you just don't care. No satisfying villain take-down that makes for a satisfying reward after a gruelling set of hours fighting them. Everyone's a victim, everything blows, and you're a mute with a one-tone reactionary personality who has guardian spirits talk, argue and bicker for them. Exhilerating.

Yet, in some sparse moments, this game feels good. From the aesthetic to the level design. Especially when trying to get through a level, every death feels earned. You slipped up, forgot or ignored this aspect of this grunt or common enemy, and pay the price. Respect every common enemy appropriately, and the level becomes a wash. Especially when trying out new skills against them. That, I can respect. Bosses don't play by this rule, as mentioned above, and rarely leave you satisfied. Only frustrated.

I leave you with the following to ponder on:
When a game is painful or punishing to play, there ought be a reward or quality to compensate for it.
Nioh 2 has these qualities, but not enough to compensate for the ramped up difficulty it boasts about.
The stick is there, but the carrot is measly and small.

If you're stubborn and have the skills to match, this game might be for you. Otherwise, prepare to be frustrated by choices you committed to and had no idea could be bad ones, and bosses that don't respect your time.",1656613594,1656613594,False,1,2,0.416666656732559204,0,True,False,False

But Nioh boasts a more impressive lineage in the Ninja Gaiden games, Team Ninja pioneered many of the same mechanics long before Fromsoft did and the visuals and aesthetic of the Nioh series are at least equally brilliant.

[b]Nioh 2 delivers an insane amount of content in a single package with an excellent and addictive combat system. A clear 10/10 for me. [/b]

[b]Intro[/b]
Well, this game is so good that I just bought it again now on PC. I platinumed it on my base PS4 back in 2020, bought the DLCs and here I am again, playing it on PC with better graphics and resolution, and it was worth it every penny.
Nioh 2 delivers a state of the art combat system that is even better than the previous game, improving every single aspect and adding new Yokai skills and weapons. The gameplay is incredibly addicting, rewarding to those who explore and make full use of the skills while also punishing every single decision or input error heavily.

[b]Story[/b]
The story in Nioh takes place before the events of Nioh 1 and you get to play as a character that you can create. The character creator is very deep and has a lot of customization options.
One of the best parts of Nioh is that it references a lot of samurai and important people that really existed in the history of Japan and represents them quite accurately in it's story. Every single Yokai and spirits are actually creatures that appear in Japanese folklore. Even the name of the swords and a few armor are equipment that existed in the past.
The story itself is focused on the history of Hideyoshi and the spiritual stones. You will notice a lot of references from the previous game, including the parents of the characters that appeared in Nioh 1 or even a younger version of the same characters.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
The gameplay is the best part of the game. It's excellent combat is high risk and high reward. Nioh 2 is a game that knows how to punish a wrong move, but also rewards the player greatly when the correct decision is made. It's high risk and high reward.
Difficulty is perfect in my opinion. It's always perfectly leveled, always delivering the right amount of challenge while being very fair. I never felt the game is unfair. Every single time that I died, I knew it was because I made a mistake and there's a way to overcome the difficult part.
Equipment management, upgradability, leveling attributes, selecting spirits and soulcores... It has a lot of depth that can change the gameplay style quite dramatically depending on which build you're aiming at. The gameplay possibilities are endless. It's a game with a lot of replay value. The story itself takes around 50 hours to beat, depending on how good you're at the game, and the DLCs probably takes about 20 hours more.

[b]Graphics & Sound[/b]
The graphics are really good in this game with a detailed models and environments. It does not match most of the story focused AAA games' graphics, but it still looks absolutely beautiful, especially because of it's excellent and creative character and monster designs. The game was clearly designed with gameplay and 60fps in mind, so a small sacrifice in image quality was needed.
Sound in this game is excellent. Both the soundtrack and the sound effects. Everything is really epic and properly selected by the developers. The SFX when hitting enemies and doing a high damage attack is very satisfying and the soundtrack that plays during missions and the map are great.

[b]PC Port[/b]
The PC Port is really good. I can run this game with a RTX 2060S at 4K DLSS Quality, Maximum settings at 60fps comfortably without any dips. The game is super stable and runs incredibly well.
It has never crashed and I never encountered any bugs during my entire playthrough.
The graphics menu has quite a good number of options to customize. It's a good port, considering that it's a KT game.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
I consider Nioh 2 a perfect game. It has everything done right, from the excellent character creator, combat system, replay value, length to finish, graphics, soundtrack and PC port quality.
Nioh 2 is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. I think it's safe to say that it is the best game I have ever played.
Nioh 1 was already a game that I considered perfect, but Nioh 2 managed to make it even better.
The series is so good that I double dipped both games on PS4 and PC, bought all the DLCs, and finished them multiple times.

I'd heard that they'd ""fixed"" some stuff like item spam you constantly sort through and other like repetitive levels or maps... But no, they haven't really. Minor tweaks a few for the better but that's it. Overall it's still largley the same game with a few new additions that while interesting, don't solve the core issues.
Core issues are still I'd say controls, they are still somewhat functionally broken at times. Input queueing is mostly not a thing, but sometimes, after thourough testing, the cases it works are slightly inconsistent, not good. Learning to only provide inputs once animations finish is not too bad if animations are clear in when they finish, but plenty aren't. Swinging a blad, stopping, breathing a second or too in that idle post attack pose and only after two and a half breaths or so does the move consider as ending, sure you'll eventually learn that exact timing but it's frankly just a big pain in the ass. The game to put it lightley makes you work for everything, you want fun, work for it, you want to learn how to attack, work for it... ok. But you want to be able to do something as simple as dodge a predictable attack you know exactly when it's coming? Hot damn if you recently put in any other actions you better work for it, or rely on luck. You want to clear items out of your inventory? Better spend time working on that. Want to progress the game, you gotta work for it. Not enjoy it, grind it. A good souls game may have some leveling moments of grinding, but I can enjoy. This one...  Way to repetitive. Overall, harsh but fair is key for these and this one just doesn't seem fair.

Now that said, you can play in a way where you avoid mixing timings or uncertainties for the most part. Only for the most part. You'll still every so often even if just standing there with full stamina not having done anything else input dodge or an action and get nothing out of it for some reason (after just playing elden ring for 300+ hours I'd know if it was my controller, no it's not that). But these completely random ones are semi rare. So the key is to always do one attack, evade back. Control distance, wait for obvious opening... one attack...
But to put it simply that takes absolutely insane amounts of time. Play the entire game safe like that, and it'd probably be a 400 hours long game, complete slog. Most enemies have plenty of health, and or habits of blocking that if you don't stack on attacks to break stamina/ki will not do any lasting effect.
Now, the occasional failure or inconsistency in controls, issues learning exact timings, etc... might not be so bad if the game was more forgiving, but it's not. Most enemies can kill you in one or two hits unless you spend time power leveling befor reaching new areas. If you are in mid stand (stance to block) and blocking, most random enemies can break it in two or three hits. Some in basically one. When broken, or running out of ki in general, you become staggered, and can't do anything for a few seconds while also being vulnerable and taking bonus damage when hit it seems.
So if you try to block an enemy, you'll often just get staggered and die from them. If you attack you expend Ki. And if you get hit you lose ki. So if you ever do more than one or two attacks many enemies could if they hit you once clear out your remaining ki, leaving you open to kill you. So for this reason you can't play actively enough imo. To play safe, is to play insanely slowly. The controls, input queue or lack there of, and other issues (not to mention overly complex control scheme) just makes it a pain to actually try to play reliably without arguably hundreds of hours of play and familiarity with everything. Some enemies you learn you can stagger spam yourself letting you deal with them quickly, but any you can't become a gamble. You'll often make it through not being staggered and dying... but some times you will, and that means one seeming random failure on inputs or anything kills you and sends you back. That's not fun in a souls game. I love me DS1, DS3, Bloodborne, Sekiro, Elden Ring, Little Witch Nobbeta, Hollow Knight, and plenty others. Not new to the general formula of high risk high reward. But this game still doesn't have it ballanced.

On the other note, the control scheme is busy, very busy. Every button has two or more things it's responsible for. And no button ever only has one thing it will do when just pressed on it's own. There's always states something else can affect it to do instead. So especially early on you'll keep trying to hit a button to do X only for Y to happen instead. Since you're in the wrong stance have the wrong item bag up, or so on. Making it worse is, stance/bag,etc... 

It's a shame, I thought with the first one they had some really good core ideas and interesting setting, and it really had potential but they kept failing with key things like ballance, enemy design, repetitive enviornments/instanced levels, and the item and UI spam. And contrary to what I'd heard, the second game doesn't really seem to have fixed any of these. A few occasional improvements but only minor things, never large or core enough to solve the underlying issues. So the result it's a game I can play, but one I feel frusterated playing quite often, and even when not getting screwed by the controls or some questionably designed enemy encounters I'm just not honestly feeling like I enjoy it too much. I'll probably finish it like always unless it gets really bad, but my thoughts are I wont recommend it unless you've played all the others and don't have anything better to do with your time and can accept possibly wasting some money.
I'm sure this type of game is a better fit for some people, like those that prefer JRPGs with the instanced world levels and item spam they often have, for a JRPG it'd be decent imo... but for a souls game per se it's quite... lacking, though definintely still better than some of the other bad attempts out there.

EDIT after another 18 hours. Ya, enemies are more and more often insane damage sponges, taking quite awhile to wittle down and kill, often have attacks that can one shot you if you get hit by them. And love chaining random attacks together at random so a move that normally you think you could attack after they use it as an opening, might instead get chained into some other big attack that could kill you. Lots of these things that mean playing it safe takes absolue ages mixed with the crap tons of raw health the enemies have, all while easily killing you if you have a mistake, or failed inputs happening. And more and more I get the rage that I sum up as this. The camera controls my life, and the enemy controls my camera. Some enemies are just highly mobile, and in rooms that are really tiny with solid vertical walls so you're camera can get stuck at bag angles where you can't see really easily why you can't dodge or move (they also have the opacity thing where stuff close to the camera fades out so you can't see it). Ya, still feels like they were close in some areas, but just... failed on lots of details. The buggy inputs not being the least.

Edit: 60 hours in, and it's just worse. I'm done... can't take this shit anymore. First game I'm not playing fully through in years that I made it more than the first hour or two into.

The psuedo last boss, lore ish wise, broke tons of major rules. Large numbers of enemies in the same fight, that don't stagger their attacks or anything. Each one can launch a variety of attacks from across the map, or up close that deal very high damage. We're talking up to eight or so at once sometimes. Ranged attacks that you might get spammed with faster than you can dodge don't even all have clear audio queues so you know when to dodge when attacked by one of the many off screen. I beat him, got into bonus content... it's just not fun, it's painful. Not rewarding, just punishing and frusterating.",1654668766,1656048852,False,3,2,0.467797249555587769,0,True,False,False

This game in its self is its own and has a lot of unique original ideas compared to other souls like games. The gameplay is very enjoyable as the combat is somewhat complex, although I admit, I at first was overwhelmed by it, nonetheless once you learn the basics of it all it's quite enjoyable considering the vast options of combat mechanics. This is something that makes the game very re-playable for someone like me that most enjoys the combat system in games. The game challenges you just like dark souls, it tests your knowledge on the games combat mechanics and pattern learning of enemies. Now the story I don't really have much to say about it except for it being intriguing and well thought out, so that would add another plus for me, I'm not huge into lore but sometimes dabble in it when I'm really into a game. Overall the graphics were exceptional along with the character design, and map layouts.

Nioh 2 is all about combat, and it's the best for 3rd person action, the developer coined the term masocore, why? 
Because the game is intend to be hard, so if you are not willing to spend some time to deep dive into the combat mechanic you won't have a good time here, but if you are willing to explore what the games provide you with, it's one of the most rewarding gaming experience ever.

Its drastically different from any soulslike I have played especially coming from elden ring which I finished 3 playthroughs of, but it isn't a massive evolution of the first game which was a new IP. 

The story is a fictional retelling of historical events with a spiritual spin on it.While people don't play this game for the story, whats there is bare bones, adequate and gets the job done. Other than Tokichiro , none of the chars are really fleshed out, events and storylines happen out of sequence and its kinda hard to follow who is who. But I digress. 

The real meat and potatoes is the combat here, which is stunning once you master all the mechanics. Its built in such a way to counteract the souls way of dodge roll spam and baiting moves out of enemies. Instead it favours aggression, blocking and ability/skill spam which makes the combat feel more engaging and visceral. Add in the sheer number of weapon types, and active skills you can augment, omniyo/ninjutsu talismans and scrolls, you just have so many options to go for and master. 

That being said the mechanics can be a bit daunting for a newbie as they have to manage stance switching, Ki pulsing(regen of stamina), the anima bar and so much more stuff like yokai abilities/burst counters. But once you get a hang of it, it just clicks. They even generalised the use of Yokai weapons(effective against humans) and purity weapons(effective against yokai and gives ki on blocking), to make for smooth sailing in the early game. 

Bosses are kinda hit and miss. The early game has some really challenging fights like yatsu-no-kami and enenra, the late game kinda peels of with bosses who are thematically very good,but offer very little challenge. Especially the humanold bosses fall flat once you abuse the ki system and drain them of their stamina.  You will also fight various versions of these bosses in gauntlet style modes later on multiple times anyway, so I guess familiarity helps. 

Now we come to the RPG mechanics and loot-game. Nioh 2 has a diablo-esque /PoE style lootgame attached to it. Your first playthrough wont be really affected by this much but there are some OP builds like the ninja builds/Iai stance builds which kinda trivialise the game when its at its most challenging. The game really starts once you get into NG+ and get access to divine gear. From here on out the game becomes a looter where you try to min-max to a T, trying to get the right modifiers to suit your play style. However, you will need the help of other players via revenant trading from the nioh 2 discord, very helpful community btw. The worst part is you have to repeat this process for ethereal gear when you unlock the two hardest difficulties. Late-game enemies and bosses have inflated health bars, which you will need really optimised gear to even scratch them especially in co-op. Then you have the underworld, scrolls and so much more grinding to reach your most optimal build. 

Here is wherein the problem lies, the only builds viable late game are grapple builds and/or builds which stack debuffs and rely on percent modifiers.  That kinda shoehorns you into a specific playstyle, where early-mid-late game was mostly about mastering your weapon with active skills and stances. Set bonuses scale terribly late game and percent modifiers take a long time to grind out. 

All-in-all despite my few gripes this is an amazing game. I hope Team Ninja stays away from the pitfalls of loot/skewed RPG progression and stick to designing mechanical combat systems players can flesh out with gear and stat spreads not based on RNG. 

I totally recommend this game if you are a sucker for dope combat, great art design and intricate levels.

I feel its only right to be fair, after i got to later parts of the game i was starting to get dips down into the 30 fps. However after the last patch i have had no major fps dips.

Update 2: 130 hours in and made it to Dream of the Nioh still very much enjoying the game. I took a bit of a break to play other games that came out, however i am now starting to play again.

This review is solely based on my personal views on the game and is not influenced by anyone or anything else, nor a paid advertisement.

[h1] My review of Nioh 2 [/h1]

[b]Gameplay:[/b] 8/10
It felt like Playing Nioh 1, but with more improvements to the original systems in place for combat and abilities. A lot of problems with the keybinding made the experience pretty bad from the get-go and having to manually tweak them again was a long painful road. It feels wacky still, but I'm managing with what I have and I hope I'll get back into how I experienced the gameplay in Nioh 1.
[hr][/hr]

[b]Weapons:[/b] 9/10
It got more weapon additions than it had in Nioh 1, and it has actual Melee weapons now (aka fists). Sadly, as a weeb, the way it works instantly made me feel in love, as it feels nostalgic whenever I combo with it. I have not got the chance to try out the others, but I hear a lot of late-game builds run Rage and Axe combo, which seems a bit OP. But, right now I am just loving how much KI management you'll need to have to use the Fists and not instantly die.
[hr][/hr]

[b]Menu + In-game UI:[/b] 8/10
Not much has changed, it is still the plain old map and quest interaction as ever. UI has to some extent changed, but at least for the better. It is better and more straightforward now. Having to look for an option is easier in this game than it was in Nioh 1.
[hr][/hr]

[b]Skill tree:[/b] 10/10
For once they managed to make something that fits perfectly with the game. It looks a bit messy to start with, but in comparison to its predecessor, this version of the game has nailed it. Though it still feels new to me what invokes to get a specific skill in said tree.
[hr][/hr]

[b]New Weapon Elements:[/b] 8/10
The new addition of Purity and Corruption elements that will invoke this element after building it up is amazing and it also fits the theme, Purity for Yokai and Corruption for Humans. Whilst most of the story is probably more the player fighting against Yokai, Corruption is still viable, though probably mostly useless depending on what build you need it for. But compared to Nioh 1, where this was not available I find it a great addition to the game, it allows more Elements to be applied and also at random... Which the ladder I'm not too fond of tbf.
[hr][/hr]

[b]Yokai Ability / Anima:[/b] 10/10
Unlike Nioh 1 where this was not even remotely a thing nor mentioned, I do find it confusing why having such a feature before Nioh 1's story was even possible to implement into the game. But, the reality isn't always needed, as this feature still hits home with what it does, having Humans/Yokai drop Soul Cores was a good addition and Soul Fusing? Man, another reason to spend years grinding again is to get the right traits and create the most epic build. It's an intriguing feature and a genius idea.
[hr][/hr]

[b]Yokai/Dark Realm + No instant restart on death:[/b] 10/10
Having played Nioh 1, knowing how hard some Enemies were, having an additional Realm on top of that which by no surprise disrupts the KI flow... Why am I not surprised that these evil developers want us to suffer so? At the very least, it allows us to regain some bar when playing CO-OP online, which was not a thing in Nioh 1. Furthermore, on the ladder of the title, you no longer restart the instant your CO-OP partner dies, which is a huge improvement, as it can sometimes be hard to carry your friend or be carried, and just it all ends because the boss just wanted to see your friend/yourself dead no matter what and let you go back to the title screen. Honestly, it's a blessing that these evil developers aren't that evil, still not gonna forgive them for all the hours spent dying and restarting entire maps because of a bad teammate or myself dying over and over to some trash lowlife Yokai scum.
[hr][/hr]

[b]My overall game score:[/b] 9/10
It doesn't feel worse than Nioh 1,  but rather the opposite. It took everything that Nioh 1 did wrong, improved, made it even more confusing, but still has a static storyline where only difficulty and monsters change and item drops rarity. Sadly, it feels like Nioh 1 gameplay-wise, except for the new weapons, abilities, and items added though and that Story is so short you can speedrun it within half a day if you are tryharding it or skip every enemy. But regardless, my friend made me fall in love with this game, so I might as well stick to continue playing it, despite my lack of being good at these sorts of games.",1654966081,1654966431,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just wish it got over the finish line compared to the gameplay of the 'souls' genre. I'll explain below.

- Loot to die for, lots of slots and rarities / sets
- Endless builds
- Endless playstyles
- Great grind / replayability
- IMMENSE amount of content

Game just rocks. It's hard at first, but one you rhythm it becomes one of those games that you look back on your first few hours in it with fondness - you *enjoy* that it was difficult to get into, because it's so satisfying when you get good. 

A few important mechanics that you can miss, I'd recommend YT tutorials like from FightinCowboy. 

The downside on Nioh:

My only gripe is the artificial difficulty that is constant throughout every level/playthrough. This is a minor point, but you recover slightly slower than the enemy, even when you've snuck up on them or dropped onto them. A few deaths are because of this, especially on higher difficulties. You drop onto the enemy, they recover really quick and 1 shot drains your ki (stamina)(because you've partially spent it attacking) and then another shot kills you while you're winded.

I feel like if there is ever going to be a Nioh 3 there just needs to be a slight tightening up on artificial difficulty like this. This game, whether it is *actually* in the souls genre or not, it IS a competitor. 

By artificial difficulty I mean:

- Inflating healthbars to ridiculous proportion
- Enemies tracking input (I KNOW it tracks when you use yokai abilities and they KNOW you're out of anima to burst counter)(tracking input is also in use when you sneak attack an enemy and go to hold block to use a L1 + x move, and the enemy immediately has set up a grapple attack (grey cloud)).
- As stated above with the recovery is too fast compared to the players in some instances, makes it so people rather just barge in there and go ham instead of utilise other methods like sneak, drop, and shoot.
- There isn't a great diversity of enemies, truly even with DLC included. 'Cursed' enemies are a cool mechanic but honestly there isn't enough types of mobs. LOTS of long-neck yokai dudes, LOTS of gaki, enki everywhere and then in the DLC just more reskinned enki. ""oh we should make the human warriors more difficult here? No sweat, put in a long-neck yokai dude."" Some levels feel nice but it's a lot of the same (the lure is definitely the loot and getting to the point where you just stomp bosses).

I would want Nioh 3 to be a huge blockbuster. Adding a bit more variety in all, including more story *in-level* (no one gives a fuck about your pre-mission blurbs and the no-context cutscenes bro sorry), and streamlining difficulty so that it scales while FEELING FAIR would be amazing.

I'm invested. Make it happen Team Ninja.

[h1]General Overview[/h1]

Take two scoops of Devil May Cry, a scoop of Ninja Gaiden, and a handful of Dark Souls and blend it up.  You'll get something close to, but not quite like, a Nioh 2 smoothie.  If, like me, you're coming from other souls-like games into Nioh you'll learn quickly the combat is faster but fluid.  Unlike Dark Souls / Elden Ring or other games like them there is less emphasis on dodging - in fact, dodging is often not your best option.  Instead there is a focus on carefully timed blocking and counter attacking.  Fights against strong enemies and bosses are only partly solved by learning the pattern and when you can punish them.  You also need to see what you can interrupt to create your own openings for flowing combo and chain attacks.

[h1]Good[/h1]

Three player co-op - easy to setup and jump straight into missions without any weird systems restricting your play.  Some duel side missions are solo only but the main story and most side missions can be played with up to two other players.
Graphics are solid, although some environments can feel overly busy.  The character creator is superb and you can create a male or female character, which should be standard by now, but is welcome here.  You will have a hard time making a character who isn't handsome / pretty, as Team Ninja is behind this one.  The cut-scenes are in-engine so your custom character and the gear you have on are reflected in the cut-scenes which is awesome.  The armor and weapon designs range from realistic to leaning deep into fantasy.  All are well modeled with beautiful textures.
Music is great, some of the tracks are so epic they'll keep your blood pumping fast as you feel the pressure to move, attack, counter, and destroy.  Sound effects have plenty of clanging metal, weapon into armor crunch, and solid hit effects.
Controls are tight and belie their fighting-game roots at times.  Learning the ki pulse, stance switching, and counter system - with slight variations for each weapon type - will take time but is incredibly rewarding once you get into the groove.  Speaking of weapon types, there is a nice variety of weapons on offer for different play styles.  As you unlock the ability and skill tree for each one they develop their own character and feel.  Once the trees are about half unlocked or more the weapons will feel very different.
The story takes place in 16th century Japan with some hefty liberties taken with real events to fit in the fantasy elements and your character's role in the alternate history presented.  Keeping track of all the characters can be difficult but fortunately there is a character guide in-game you can consult to keep up with the story as it plays out.
The game can be modded.

[h1]Neutral[/h1]

The game is difficult and makes no apologies for it.  Some of the duel side-missions are harder than anything the main story will throw at you but the main missions are no slouch, either.  The flip side of the difficulty is the satisfaction you will get as your skills improve and you conquer a challenging enemy or boss.  Be warned, however, the difficulty is no joke and there is no easy option.  The game plays best on a controller, keyboard and mouse not so much.

[h1]Bad[/h1]

This is a well polished game and most of ""the bad"" would resolve to nit picks.  With that said, the game wastes no time throwing complex systems at you with barely a tutorial.  It took me some time to wrap my head around the controls as this game will utilize every button on a controller and then some.  The twilight missions use a red filter / lighting system that hides the beauty of the levels they take place in.  I wish you could tone down the effect as they are SO RED.  Some of the music is short repeating loops that can grate after awhile, even though for the most part the music is great.  The aforementioned twilight missions are also the only content that gets level synced, so if you are teaming up with a low level friend on a high level character you will eliminate a huge chunk of the challenge for them and stomp the lower level missions.  With all of the special effects in combat your screen can get cluttered in flashes, sparkles, hit indicators, and more at times.  There are mods to tone this down but the default game can be overwhelming visually at times.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1] 

Nioh 2 is a solid game.  Expertly designed combat takes some getting used to but is very satisfying once you begin to learn and eventually master it.  Three player co-op with custom characters is fantastic.  Even at full price this game is a worthwhile purchase but it sometimes goes on sale and I enthusiastically recommend snagging it at a good price.",1654554637,1654554637,True,95,2,0.885832905769348145,0,True,False,False

I easily can call it my favourite game of all times due to many reasons.

+ Complex, fast paced combat system. There are 11 weapons with unique movesets which are also customisable. You can assign moves to different stances, put arcanas on them that add different properties and such. Also, every weapon has unique mechanic. For example, Splitstaff allows you to extend combos, dealing more hits per attack at a greater range.

+ Customisation. You can customise everything. Your weapon moves, your appearance, your build, your special effects. There is so much variety. Also, character creation is super good.

+ Loot. There is a lot of it. And it's useful. You can mix and match item sets, you get starred effects, which only can be randomly found on gear at higher difficulties, you can get divine and ethereal graces which have unique effects. And if you don't want an item, you can break it down for parts for crafting, so nothing goes to waste.

+ Yokai abilities. You can collect soul cores and use abilities of your enemies against them. They are super fun and most of them look awesome. Kasha, Ryomen Sukuna, Oni-bi - these are some of my favourite.

+ Endgame underworld arena, twilight missions and demon parade scrolls. There are 3 endgame activities that you can do, each of them is full of challenging enemies.

+ Coop. This is always a plus in my book. You can play with 2 of your friends or just random guys and experience some real mayhem.

+ Visuals and aesthetics. Game is aesthetically consistent and beautiful. Armour, weapons, monsters, levels - everything is just amazing. Artists really outdid themselves this time around.

+ Enemy variety. Amount of enemies you have to fight is also great. They easily doubled the amount of foes you meet compared to Nioh 1.

One thing I do not see much, when it comes to praise, is the music. The OST has got to be one of my favorites. Helping to convey every type mood just right in a lot of cases. Is it Witcher3? Not to be rude, but no. But still, for me, it is up there. Level design is fun and some even come with my favorite... shortcuts! I always appreciate them and stumbling upon one when needed instantly brings a rush if done proper (I'm not hard to please). 

However, I think criticism is good. 
1. Parrying. I'm not the biggest fan when multiple weapon types have multiple button prompts for the same result. Using my controller as an example. On one weapon, parry is RB+X. On another weapon, RB+Y...... Why? This will only bring confusion. Although I hate to assume (starts with ass for a reason), characters can have up to two melee weapons at once. So the percentage is high someone ends up mixing the parry between the two. Especially if you're like me. I try and play with EVERYTHING (Except the hatchets and short swords. Too weak, imo) and in this type of game, that truly is life or death sometimes. If it were up to me, I would consolidate the prompts. Matching them the best you can. With the way it is, I feel this layers for the sake of being ""layers"". 

2. Reusing locations. When it comes to side missions, each region has them. My issue is some side missions take place at a location one, maybe even two regions ago. While the story takes place across Japan. So either your character travels ALL the way back to these locals, or people hired the same temple designer and no one has caught on yet. All jokes aside, from repetitiveness to illogical it becomes a little tiresome to fight in the same forest / temple time and time again. This is not to say all side missions take place in the same two locations. Sometimes they too get a new local. But to drive my point home, I am currently in the third region but I am doing a side mission at a location in the first region. Just saying. It would be nice if they were unique as the main missions are. I know it would be a lot of work, but it could go a long way for the player traveling through it. 

3. Crafting. I do not mind it. The game is based around RNG (at least I think it is) when it comes to picking up weapons off the floor. Crafting is a way to circumvent your weapons becoming stale. Or at least it should. So far in 55hrs, crafting hasn't helped. I tried crafting a few times but it wasn't even close to what I wanted / looking for. Especially when it comes to the attributes. Bare bones compared to what you find in the missions. Nowhere near a deal breaker but I find it funny it is here. Maybe an end game thing? Time will tell. But for now, I just do not see it being useful. This is not to say the blacksmith isn't useful overall. She does a load of other things you will use throughout your journey. Though, most likely crafting isn't one of them. 

4. Speechless! Main character is custom and in this case, that means not a peep outta them. No matter what happens, nothing. I am just not a fan of this approach. I get why devs do it, it isn't cheap getting multiple people do the same lines. Especially if there is multiple male / female voices to choose from. Hopefully, if there is a Nioh3, they can have at least one male / female voice actor for your character. Like the unique missions, it goes a long way imo. Keep in mind, most of the time it comes down to world ending stuff! Meanwhile your character is just standing there.... staring... confused? No. Determined! Hungry? Or maybe they just have to let out a far... I don't know! Because they don't say.

5. What am I covered in?? There is multiple types of counters in Nioh2. I can appreciate them all honestly. Granted maybe one can be removed. Burst Counter. A special type of counter for special enemy attacks. I was OK with this until I started to notice some cases, if you're character isn't not lined up just right, you will slide to the enemy left, or right. Not only missing, but taking damage too. It can be infuriating honestly. Especially when you realize how hard these attacks hit. Either give some leeway, or remove imo. Also, word of advice, if you do slide to the right or left, don't chase the enemy down, spamming Burst Counter. Just let it go.. Trust me.  

As you can see, there isn't much wrong with Nioh2 in my eyes. Which is funny because I played at release and stopped while in the second region. I was playing the forest level for the 2nd, or 3rd time. Became bored honestly. Glad I played Mortal Shell, got me in the mood again for more Souls-Like and here I am. It is a fun, fast paced melee game. I usually rate Souls-like with a great for beginners, intermediate or give me SoulsBorne level. Nioh2 is defiantly intermediate. You may want Lords of the Fallen, Surge1, Code Vein or Ashen under your belt before jumping in. This one comes at you fast! Give it a go!",1653973994,1654098159,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1325200,113016003,76561198009344328,0,7,56110,0,19824,1692844314,"Nioh 2 starts out excellent but gets worse and worse with every NG+ cycle as enemies turn more and more into giant damage sponges with excessively damaging attacks. That wouldn't necessarily be bad in and of itself, but it exacerbates other problems; these are so numerous that I've decided to list them:

- Bad hitboxes on both your and enemy attacks and especially on counters. This of course heavily favors the AI, since it only needs to get lucky once. This also includes attacks sometimes harmlessly passing through their target, enemy attacks sometimes doing two ticks of damage rather than just one, countered attacks dealing damage anyway, lingering hitboxes still dealing damage even when the enemy that produced them is already dead, etc.
- Tracking issues. Tracking is generally very sluggish for both you and enemies, with both your character and an enemy wildly flailing in the wrong directions at the same time being a common sight, but enemies sometimes track perfectly with no warning. Like the previous point, this is also a much bigger problem for the fragile, lonesome you than for the tanky and numerous enemies.
- There is a bug where your stamina starts regenerating after being reduced to zero due to an enemy hit, then after a second gets reduced to zero again, this time for no apparent reason. This delays your recovery considerably and often leads to death.
- No friendly fire among enemies. Ranged enemies will happily shoot you through their buddies, a fact the developers shamelessly exploit in abusive encounter design throughout the entire game.
- Multiple bosses in the same fight. N2 has evidently not learned the lessons of N1 and repeats the same mistake of putting multiple bosses designed to be fought individually into the same fight, which is especially bad in combination with the preceding point, as these bosses can and do attack through each other with wide, sweeping attacks that become impossible to avoid when coming in at twice the normal frequency.
- Blatantly cheating enemy NPCs with ridiculous stats, including being able to cancel animations in ways that the player can't, being able attack faster and farther than the player, having faster projectiles, using better versions of spells than the player gets (e.g. their spell projectiles are homing, yours are not), and being able to sprint faster and without using up stamina.
- Hyperarmor, which means the enemy becomes immune to stagger during their attack. This is a bad gameplay mechanic in general, since it means you can start an attack against a vulnerable enemy that would stagger them, except they decide to launch an attack of their own before yours lands, don't get staggered as a result, and hit you despite being hit first. Giving the AI the ability to retroactively make what was a safe opening for attack into a deathtrap once the player has committed is poor design in any game, doubly so in one as unforgiving as this.
- Input-reading enemies. Since the computer has instant reaction time, the fact that some enemies can dodge means that your attacks effectively have an X% chance of doing nothing other than making you vulnerable, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it. Some enemies abuse this to a monstrously excessive degree, obviously designed to be obnoxious rather than challenging.
- Camera issues. Given the quick pace of combat and constant movement, the camera freaking out is a frustratingly common occurrence, especially near walls. This is exacerbated by enemies that are able to break lock-on, forcing you to try to wrangle the camera in their vague direction and reestablish lock-on, and by enemies who attack by zooming across the room at warp speed in erratic patterns, forcing you to either break lock-on yourself or do your best not to puke as the camera sways around wildly. This issue is also exploited in abusive encounter design, e.g. placing a boss that is able to push you around into a tight arena so that you get pushed into a wall and die because you can't see what's going on, levels with narrow ledges along cliff faces so that you literally cannot avoid being near a wall, etc.
- Enemy projectiles can pass through some solid objects. Unless you memorize the entire game through trial and error, you will sometimes get hit when you absolutely shouldn't, since what looks like perfectly good cover might well not be.
- Enemies get invincibility during their grapple attacks but you don't during (most of) yours. Some even get invincibility during some of their longer wind-ups.
- Mix-ups, where enemies pretend to have ended their combo only to resume attacking and get you when you try to punish. This wouldn't be too bad if it was used sparingly and consistently, but some enemies can do it several times during a single combo, or they might decide not to, it's random, and you can never tell whether an opening is real or a trap. These unlearnable attack patterns are especially bad in combination with:
- Unreactable attacks. Sometimes there's absolutely nothing you can do to avoid being hit, especially by grabs, since for some the hitbox is active from the moment their telegraph animation starts (rather than from the moment the telegraph ends and the attack itself begins).
- Enemies can shoot straight up and down, whereas you are limited to about 45 degrees. This means that in some situations, enemies are free to shoot you, but you have no way to retaliate.
- Anti-player bias. With a handful of exceptions, enemies who should be hostile to each other team up against the player for no apparent reason (e.g. demons and demon hunters).

These issues start out minor, but the longer you play, the more they come to the forefront of the experience. They're no big deal when 99 of your deaths result from your own mistakes and only 1 from one of these issues; when the ratio is reversed, they suddenly seem far more serious. As you progress through the game and improve your skill, you get to a point where your deaths almost exclusively result from these issues, and that is the point where the game ceases to be fair and therefore fun. Can you learn to play around them? Absolutely. Should you have to? Absolutely not. The fact that these issues can be worked around does not negate the fact that they are issues.

As a general principle, the less forgiving a game's difficulty is, the more solid its gameplay mechanics need to be, and Nioh 2's gameplay mechanics unfortunately do not adequately support the level of difficulty the game eventually builds up to. As a result, players who stick it out until endgame almost invariably go for stamina-depleting builds so that they can stunlock bosses and don't have to deal with any of their attacks (as shown in numerous, easily googled videos).

To sum up, Nioh 2 unfortunately spends far too much effort on flashy and self-indulgent window dressing and far too little on gameplay fundamentals. The game's alright for a casual playthrough, I guess, but I can't in good conscience recommend it for the kind of serious commitment that its numerous NG+ cycles and randomized endgame zones seem to expect.",1648556353,1654090985,False,1,1,0.404136061668395996,0,True,False,False

 - Some of the best looking souls-like games out there. Combines art direction + graphics perfectly. This game will stilll look great in 10 years.
 - Very deep combat design. Lots to learn playing the game. Making your own build is extremely fun.
 - Some interesting characters. I actually like some of the secondary characters. Many of them are very well acted.
 - ""Fun"" online gameplay. Sometimes boring. But there's no problems with toxicity, since you won't fight other players. Co-op is often cool.
 - Easier than it looks. There are several ""cheat"" items like items to leave without losing experience. Items to reset talents, skills, items to heal all negative effects, items to recover your lost ""souls"". Often feels like these items exist just to avoid having to balance the game mechanics.
 - Some interesting shinto folklore.

Negatives
 - Some of the worst boss design in gaming history. I was bothered by it a lot when I played the first Nioh. But hoped it was improved in the sequel. When you feel that there's no way to dodge some insta-kill attacks. When you feel there's no way to defeat a boss without raising your damage. When you feel like you have to summon someone higher level to kill the boss for you (players are massively overleveled here, they might even one shot the boss). You know the boss simply sucks.
 - Some of the parts of the game are extremely bland and boring. I finished the game twice. Barely remembers what happened more than half of the game.
 - You have to play the game once. Then you get another new game+ with a few more items. Then gets another new game+ with more items and even more grinding. Then one more new game+. I got tired before ending the third time. But I know there's still 1 or 2 more entire playthroughs before I'm endgame. No patience for that.
 - All of the game's deep mechanics looses their meaning in the highest difficulties. What is the point of having a build when everyone is just building damage. And the bosses are nothing but sandbags that one shot you with ""cool"" attacks.

I'm going back to original souls games. Can't stand the bosses from here.

Some things to note for those who haven't played the first one:
Character Customizer, 3-mode combat called stances, Massive perk tree akin to older RPGs (each weapon is a branch, as well as Onmyo Magic and Ninjutsu Arts), mechanic driven combat, Boss fights that'll take your teeth out, TONS of content

To keep it brief-ish, this game is easily in my top 10. These titles play akin to a souls game, and so I was able to pick up NIOH 1 pretty quick, and had a lot of fun with that. NIOH 2 then adjusted the dial, giving us the character creator and a new Oni form that allows you to also use enemy abilities in a sort of ""collect the soul - use it's signature attack"" method. Some new weapon types also pop-up here like the Switchglaive, making for a super diverse path for you to take on your way through missions, as your Oni form also comes in 3 flavors of offensive capability (very, moderately, and defensive); which can also be paired with any of the enemy attack souls (but there is benefit for understanding what to mix and match).

Combat is also very risk vs reward, and more-so than in Souls titles imo. When you run out of stamina and get hit, you probably are dying if you didn't already, as you get the wind knocked out of you. Simultaneously, enemies flinch less, but when you break their stamina, you can slap them like you just guest starred in the three stooges. Otherwise, you unlock combos as you fight and slowly work up into just comboing bosses out until you eventually see a notice pop-up and you just perfected one.

Lastly, this game does not demand you learn too much about the elements and mixing and matching status ailments/buffs, but without them you will slowly stagnate at a point and hit one hell of a wall. Bosses are not just the Souls style ""Remember the moves"", but they are meaty beasts that come in many flavors, both man and demon. One boss may just be some NPC guy where you need to fight more passively using one element for added damage, but then the next one may be fire personified and you need to leverage the arena to get him weaker, to then just going mano-a-mano with your friendly neighborhood Toad-demon.

Despite looking graphically and technically similar to its predecessor, Nioh 2 masterfully improves the formula all-round, delivering on its promise. The game‚Äôs plot is a prequel to the previous title, so you don‚Äôt have to play it first to experience this gem. The storyline and lore focus on Japanese historical events mixed with folklore. 

[b]Nioh 2 is not a FromSoftware clone[/b], both do share many similarities, the review will be focusing on what distinguishes them and Nioh 2‚Äôs catch-all mechanics.

[h1] A page is taken out of:[/h1] 
‚Üí [b]Diablo‚Äôs[/b] focus on loot, colour-coded gear, variables, stats, and build variety.
‚Üí [b]Monster Hunter‚Äôs[/b] focus on combat, crafting, characters, and re-playability.
‚Üí [b]Dark Soul‚Äôs[/b] mechanics such as bonfires, bloodstains, consumable items, stamina management, exploration, ecstatic clashes, and various other intricacies.

[h1] Mechanically the best Soulsborne ever made:[/h1] 
Using Dark Souls syntax I‚Äôll focus on why Nioh 2 goes beyond adding reason and purpose to many established souls like mechanics.

[b]A nexus-styled map:[/b] Akin to what you‚Äôd see in Demon Souls where you choose where to go next. Although maps are isolated areas, each is masterfully crafted and can take an hour or longer depending on your skill. They are graced with well-thought-out shortcuts that loop back and forth to your bonfires. This model allows them to fine-tune main and side quests with different changes when you revisit each area, even adding unique missions such as a boss rush.

[b]Invisible walls and others:[/b] Not invisible in Nioh, they are alive and they can pack a pack-a-punch if you annoy them, luckily they can be friendly if you pose for them with the right gesture, the same applies to mimics that can be cooperative or fiendish.

[b]Bloodstains:[/b] No longer just a time capsule or snippet of some unlucky fellow‚Äôs darkest hour, you can interact with them and summon an AI version of a player, fight and loot them. On the other side of the spectrum, there are benevolent graves to aid you when you need them most.

[b]Bonfires:[/b] Provide the same type of solace and vast array of mechanics like leveling, and attuning magic, they also grant you with a few other options like being able to donate loot in exchange for rice, a currency that only allows you to buy local items and fine-tune the difficulty of an area with increasing the amount of healing items (They have a hard cap).

[b]Leveling:[/b] Works the same as in Dark Souls or Elden Ring, except for basic skills and each weapon type has its sphere grid tree with multiple skills you can choose from and bind to different keystrokes to further enhance your build. The game has various other options like fame, a tea house, and more to further tweak and optimise everything about your character.

[b]Proper NG+ content:[/b] Rewards you with each subsequent play-through, vastly changing the way the game plays. Like the addition of new enemies, gear tiers, stats, and even a brand new game mode.

[b]Stamina:[/b] Isn‚Äôt just a simple stat, it‚Äôs Nioh‚Äôs bloodline, far more important than it ever has been in most games, it works half similarly to Dark Souls, except in the way you recover it, you regain it far faster if you time your ‚ÄúKi pulses‚Äù, rewarding players with mechanical expertise. 

[b]‚ÄúYokai realms‚Äù:[/b] Tie to stamina as these dimensions halve how fast you regen it until you find the host and kill them. But like all in Nioh for every disadvantage, there‚Äôs a counter, ‚ÄúYokai realms‚Äù which provide you with stronger ‚ÄúAnima‚Äù skills (Magic).

[b]Parrying:[/b] Has a yin and yang effect, providing an exceptional counter to enemies and bosses, when they try to land a critical strike on you, you have three ways you can parry, depending on the guardian spirit you equip.

[b]Guardian spirits:[/b] Provide passive bonuses and stats that enhance your skills whilst also providing you with a mechanism that you can use once energised as a special mode where you‚Äôll deal way more damage for a brief period. When you die you have to collect your guardian spirit to recover your souls or recall it and lose everything being able to use ‚ÄúYokai skills‚Äù once more.

[b]Soul cores:[/b] Are tied to guardian spirits, you can mimic attacks or buffs from all enemies and bosses in the game and use them like you‚Äôd use magic, with its mana pool called ‚ÄúAnima‚Äù.

[b]Other types of magic:[/b] Provided are omnyo magic and ninjutsu skills, which are not tied to any mana and instead are a consumable item you use and that replenishes once you rest at a bonfire, allowing you to enhance your stealth abilities, damage enemies with different ailments, buff or debuff them to your heart‚Äôs desire.

[b]Gear wise:[/b] The game is a tinkerer's dream, with so many tangible stats, set bonuses, and different synergies for the ultimate build. You attain them by finding decent loot or crafting and mixing items until you get the desired outcome. Familiarity comes to play too as it helps with inheriting stats between gear and increasing your defence or damage output with some spells centred around it.

[b]S tier musical album:[/b] Displaying very high quality all around.

[b]Controls:[/b] Ingeniously assigned and work well in tandem with the myriad amount of options the game provides.

The achilles heel of Nioh 2 is the GUI‚Äôs clutter and the lack of PVP.  It does support co-op though.

[h1] Describing the combat:[/h1] 
What makes this gem glimmer, putting every other souls-like/borne to shame. You have three stances, low, med, and high, see them as your light and heavy attack, except that each one of them has its strengths, weaknesses, their attacks, and skills that you can combo with.

The game encourages you to experiment and play with more than a single weapon type and to use two types of ranged weapons as they are viable and very useful in dealing with enemies. 

You can‚Äôt wield a shield so you‚Äôll be sidestepping, rolling, and evading in a game that has some of the best hit-boxes ever conceived, there‚Äôs stealth incorporated as well, with your usual suspects such as backstabs. 

[h1] Miscellaneous:[/h1] 
‚Üí [b]Item descriptions exist[/b]
‚Üí [b]Stat numbers can be disabled[/b]
‚Üí [b]You can‚Äôt jump[/b]
‚Üí [b]Cursed weapons that can talk to you.[/b]
‚Üí [b]Items you find on dead bodies carry memories with them.[/b]

[h1] Conclusion:[/h1] 
Nioh 2 is a hell of a gem, deserving every bit of love and attention, a game that keeps on giving amazingly crafted all round and that you can come back any time after a long while and be addicted again, if you enjoy it you‚Äôll be indulged with one of the most satisfying combat systems ever made.

Team Ninja's best game since Ninja Gaiden, and my favorite modern action game.

++ Some of the best, tightest, most fluid melee combat around. 
Each weapon style has three stances that can combo into each other. 
There's a ""ki pulse"" system for regenerating ki/stamina that has a satisfying rhythm to it once you get the hang of it.
Plenty of abilities are available to you at any given time, between stances, weapon skills, spells and ninjitsu, items, ranged weapons, Yokai abilities, and an ""ult"" in your Yokai Shift which turns you into a metal af yokai for as long as you can make it last.
It took me a while to get the hang of it when I first picked up Nioh 2 - I struggled on the first boss for hours - but this gameplay is some of the most rewarding and empowering I've ever experienced.

+ S-tier character creator, surprising since I can't think of another Team Ninja game with character creation
^ TBH these alone make it one of my favorite games, but it goes on:

+ Beautiful Japanese setting
+ Dark story and great cutscenes with some likable characters and badass historical figures
+ Great atmospheric soundtrack
+ Addictive gear system that will appeal to fans of classic Blizzard ARPGs. You can change your gear's appearance!
+ Great sound design that makes finishing moves feel brutal
+ Co-op is a blast, the ""expeditions"" mode is much less restrictive than other souls-likes' co-op modes. You can legit just progress through the game together.

= Graves everywhere while playing online, can be a bit immersion-breaking. The loot is great though lol

- Dated linear level design, would love to see a well-executed open world Nioh 3 some day

This game has a special spot in my gamer heart and it's one of my favorite memories of the past few years.

Side note, I would definitely recommend Nioh 2 over both Nioh 1 and Team Ninja/Square Enix's newer Final Fantasy Origins game. You do not need to have played Nioh 1 to understand the story or gameplay, you're playing as a whole new character.",1651828032,1652657486,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You get constantly invaded in that game, you get locked out of doing co-op if you've already beaten the boss of an area. Nioh 2 is exactly the opposite, the co-op experience is amazing. You never get involved in PVP and you are encouraged to finish the level and then help others do the same, or you can play a mode called Expeditions where you and someone else do a level together for the first time and both get credit towards completing in single player if you win. The only drawback is that in Expeditions they double the health of the enemies and you can't collect your lost ""souls"" if you die. So, it's actually a better experience I've found to just have one person beat a level and then they can join you and help you through it. 
Besides co-op the game is tricky to learn the mechanics. It is more complex by far than a Dark Souls game. The Ki Pulse, Flux and Burst Counter are very important mechanics to doing well and they are not explained all that well in the tutorial and are hard to master. I recommend watching some Youtube videos on how to play before diving in so that you get to know these mechanics early on so they become natural. Also, the control scheme is very different from Dark Souls games so I had to reconfigure it a lot as my muscle memory was getting very confused. I mostly figured out a good balance except you can't configure dodge to B it will always be A. I can live with that.

If your here for the gameplay then its just as solid, if not BETTER than Nioh 1.  New weapons and a fleshed out skill tree mean theres a playstyle for almost anyone out there, and if your that dedicated you can do some wacky shit like mid stance parry over an enemy while slicing them into a low stance combo just to finish it off with a high stance heavy attack or something even more wacky. But for anyone whos worried, r1 spamming in mid stance works fine, I don't tend to get overly complicated with my combat but the amount of weapons / enemies who a certain stance is better against keeps it fresh.

My main problem comes with the story. Nobody claims Nioh 1 had a groundbreaking story anywhere near the level of darksouls but it was solid none the less, you were a dude chasing down this tattoo covered gremlin who stole your spirit gf and every mission in some way felt like you were getting closer to that goal.

granted I haven't finished the story of Nioh 2 yet but to me I don't feel like theres a 'point' in doing that. Your mom gets killed by a strange yokai man and you basically live on your own till yokai start popping up around your crib, then some monkey man finds you and you just follow him around? Right now I'm helping nobunaga on his quest to reunite all of japan but I don't see why my character really cares? Another thing is that Nioh 2 is a prequel, meaning you also don't get to observe the actions you took in Nioh 1 and their effects. 

Maybe its just because I have less time in my life now than when I played Nioh 1 but I don't feel that compelled to explore or enter the next mission. I'm mostly just playing since I payed 40 bucks for this and I've got nothing better to do. 

Another little gripe is how tanky normal enemies are. The first little imp enemy you find at the start of the game takes me a full ki bar+ to kill because of how the scaling of enemies work, If your spamming your spirit cores this gets a little bit more manageable but at times the guardian spirit you'd exclusively use for boss fights in nioh 1 feels like it needs to be brought out just to take out some of the harder enemies (that respawn when you die)",1651992623,1651992623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The things that I will admit about this game is that it looks very good, the combat is incredibly responsive, the level layouts are actually very well done with shortcuts and shrines, and it is as difficult as people have advertised... at the start.

I'm not too far in I don't think, but this game struggles in a couple of aspects. One is enemy variety, which leads to combat staleness pretty quickly, and another is the same issue that I had with the DLC of the first game... fights take way too long with very little room for error to get one-shot. There are a couple of weapons that are a little better at doing ""critical"" hits to some enemies, but for the ones that can't, the fights take even longer. The bigger issues  is that due to the nature of the larger enemies, your fight will often just be swing three times and wait for the literally exact same attack they just did rinse repeat for a long time. This leads to a desire to when you inevitably do die to a random enemy that grabs you and kills you or pushes you off a cliff that you just want to run to your spirit to get your experience back instead of fighting your way throw. Fights are much more interesting and worth doing if you only have to avoid the same 2 or 3 moves 2 or 3 times instead of 10-20 because every single enemy has super armor to worry about.

Now I did mention ""At the start"" for a reason... once you find a good weapon, the game starts to get pretty trivial with no incentive to really do much else. I started with the fists weapon because I wanted to use a quick relentless punching weapon. Fists require you to invest in a stat that almost exclusively ups damage, and no defensive abilities. I decided to switch my route to a switchglaive weapon which allowed me to invest into a defensive stat while also increasing its damage... Not only am I more tanky and I do more damage, but the switchglaive's moveset also is able to land these critical hits I referred to earlier on the bigger enemies. It went from overbearing where the first and second boss would take me 10 minutes to beat and I had to worry about being hit once to literally just swinging away like a madlad.

The bosses are also just.... not that interesting... They do too much damage to properly reward proper aggressive gameplay due to how much HP they have, and can be lured into doing the same 2 attacks over and over for a couple of hits until they die. Yeah, it's not that interesting... could probably do it more interestingly, but I would much rather learn the bosses moves on my first try, and kill it in the second instead of spending many many many hours trying to have more fun being more aggressive just to die in one hit and have to start a long boss fight over...


TL;DR version, I'm likely going to play through the whole game anyway, but fights are just too damn long for how punishing a single mistake is. It is not nearly as fun as it could be to have so many tools at my disposal but feel the best route to victory being ""poke - poke - dodge - wait"" with the occasional rifle/arrow shots.

Edited Review: I just finished the campaign, and I have to say that my initial concerns regarding life pools and damage were very much resolved. The bosses became much more enjoyable, but I don't know what actually caused it as the first couple of bosses were definitely killing me in one hit, while the later bosses would take 3-4, which is what I would expect from a game like this. Game became much more enjoyable, and will likely be playing through the DLC and NG+'s like I did in Nioh 1 for the better gear and getting other weapons skill trees up.",1651507861,1651959477,True,0,0,0.532565653324127197,5,True,False,False

Wow, everybody is saying ""Oh Nioh 2 is even harder than Dark Souls or Elden Ring"" and well yes it might be true because some enemies two shot you. 

But then again you need to read the rules. If you see a big text on the screen saying ""You don't need to fight every enemy"" maybe don't try to fight that  big creepy horse boss right now but later when you levelled up. Also you can summon NPC helpers everywhere. They are really helpful with normal enemies and also bosses and take away the aggro from you. Don't worry it's still very hard tough haha.

The game is much different than Elden Ring and to be honest, it's a lot of fun as it is very loot based. You find tons of loot and it's really cool to search for new items. The combat is very engaging and hits good.

I also like the mechanic of summoning help very easily (blue swords on the ground) and also summon enemies to fight (red swords). Sometimes I just stay in an area and fight many red guys because like I said the combat is really fun. 

I also really like the weapons. Usually I am a sword and shield guy but oh well there is no shield so suddenly I am using this big ass sword called uhm Odaki I think and then suddenly I find some gleves or however they are called and they are also a lot of fun.

First I thought the 3 stances are a pain but it's really not that hard once you get used to it. I am in mid and low stance most of the time to be able to hit enemies faster.

But you need to realize: This game is hard and it has waaaaay more buttons to press than Elden Ring or Dark Souls. Press RB + Button to switch stances, press RT + Button to use those super monster powers, switch weapons, use items, press RT + B to parry the enemy glowing red attacks and so on. But you get used to it. 

Look I am not saying this game is better than Dark Souls or Elden RIng. But I am saying that this game is much faster and action oriented and you will find tons of loot and I really like that. I loved Elden Ring but the open world was so empty most of the time and that is something I totally dislike - Just riding your horse until you finally meet your next enemy to bash.

And I think especially in the beginning you need to carefully choose your targets. If an enemy is too hard try to run away. And level up frequently until you are stronger. In the beginning I was weak af but after only 2.5 hours I have better gear, better understanding of the mechanics and also I summon an NPC to help me to fight this creepy horse monster haha. It's a lot of fun.

Nioh 2 had a fairly rough launch on PC, and the game still has issues, but as of the latest patch I can safely recommend the game.
Nioh is often described as a ""Souls-like"", and while there're many elements that it adopted from that genre, you realize that it's more its own thing the deeper you dive into the game.
Like the first game, the game combines excellent melee combat while also doubling down on RPG aspects.

[b]Positive aspects:[/b]
[list]
[*]11 weapon types, each featuring a huge movelist
[*]Stance system and Ki management feel very rewarding
[*]Excellent character creator
[*]Huge amount of build variety
[*]Much better human bosses compared to the first game
[*]Tons of content, on average people take around 100 + hours to finish the first playthrough
[*]Yokai Skills (allows you to momentarily transform into an enemy Yokai and use one of their attacks)
[*]Better enemy variety than the first game
[*]DLSS support (decently implemented)
[/list]

While the game is filled with content, this sometimes works against it.
You'll be busy managing your items and equipment very frequently. 
This combined with the grindy, RNG driven aspects of the loot can be a huge turn off for some players.
Additionally, the PC port of the game still suffers from a few issues.

[b]Negative aspects:[/b]
[list]
[*]Very grindy and RNG heavy, worst offender being the special Boss Skills
[*]Repetitive areas in some side missions and during very late game
[*]Item quick-selection menu could've been improved
[*]Some elements are poorly balanced (Kasha's Yokai Skill being arguably too strong for example)
[*]Even on capable hardware, particle effects can cause FPS drops (this has been heavily improved since release, but is still present)
[*]Atrocious LOD popin in some scenes, with no option to change the LOD range
[*]Game doesn't accept most custom resolutions

As you can see, Nioh 2 is far from being a perfect game, and it's sad to see that Team Ninja still hasn't figured out how to make a proper PC port.
However, if you can look past the games' objective shortcomings and can accept its grindy nature, you're looking at one of the best ARPGs ever made.",1612563752,1651678132,True,3,0,0.56886899471282959,0,True,False,False

if you like struggling at all, get it.
if you like souls games, get it.
if you like action games, get it, it plays like devil may cry, with your light attack 3x combo and your two attack heavy and to do anything fancier you gotta unlock it for that weapon type. but its not arduous. its fun, i dont feel like its grinding due to the intensity at which anything can kill me i cant sleep on it.",1651619123,1651619123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are good, the story is decent, but where this game really shines is both the combat and the character customization. The use of four different stances (high, mid, low and sheathed) which have their own unique attacks as well as the ki pulse mechanic which helps you recover your stamina once you get a hang of the timing is pretty unique. The weapon variety and the plentiful options for where to spend your skill points for weapons, magic, ninjutsu and upgrades to your demon form as well as the samurai tree which primarily deals with ki and base stats, is very nice. Combine all that with the myriad of randomized bonuses you get from your weapons and armor that drop quite often from enemies, it all makes for seemingly endless ways for you to build your character. The main story isnt bad, even the side missions have some interesting lore especially in the dlcs. The dlc stories and zones were even better than the main story i feel. The few things i have against this game though are, one, im not a huge fan of the diablo-style loot system, having to check over every piece of gear you pick up early on in the game to make sure its not an upgrade can get tedious, not a game killer for me though, gets better as you find more pieces for your build, you can just sell most of your stuff with out having to look at it at that point. The other thing and this is the biggest negative in my book. This game has new game plus modes available which is fine. That being said i was greatly discouraged from moving onto them because of how much the difficulty increases which each one and with this game making your character very dependant on having the right bonuses for your build from weapons and armor, theres a problem... the RNG of getting the specific bonuses you need for said build can be a very very boring grind late game. I only went to the end of new game and stopped because finding the three bonuses i needed for each armor piece was taking waaaaay too long and costing me waaaaay too much in game money using the temper option at the blacksmith. You can temper your gear by using money and materials and it will reroll bonus stats but with there being soo many stats in that pool its incredibly tough to get what you need. I ended up settling for one or two of my stats i need for each piece cause getting a third was insane. For that reason i believe that for poeple like myself that dont want to grind out those stats i would still highly suggest getting this game but only beating it on new game then going with another character instead of new game plus. Aside from that reroll feature i give this game a solid 9/10.",1651618282,1651618282,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

- Hundreds upon hundreds of hours of content
- New difficulty play throughs significantly alter how the game plays, new systems, enemy movesets, weapons & gear, AI, game mechanics.  Not just 'Lulz enemies have more health & damage'
- An addicting Diablo style of gear and loot drops
- Tons of weapons & armour, all with their own unique looks for you to alter and transmog to your liking
- Massive array of builds and ways to play and overcome your enemy
- Very challenging gameplay to put your skills to the test
- FULLY COOP, easily host up to 2 friends for full coop play, easy to set up, no infuriating cryptic coop methods (staring right at you Dark Souls - Elden Ring)
- Incredible enemy designs.  Based on Japanese Mythology, the story incorporates real people & places with its fantastical setting and creatures.

Basically Dark Souls meets Diablo.
100-120 hour Campaign+DLC depending on choice of weapon skill level.
The combat is fast and responsive and the enemies are too. Boss fights are incredibly addicting and fair and challenging.  You can beat the campaign largely ignoring the Blacksmith and the Crafting/RPG elements. 
[hr][/hr] 
Now you can end the game there and have gotten your money's worth, or you can move forward into the new game plus cycles (which I'm starting) which significant increase the challenge of the game (and it's not just a raw numbers increase, with enemies and bosses gaining new abilities and increased action speeds) and it is here that the RPG in aRPG really starts to shine, with builds become more specialized, and the crafting and farming of gear more important.  The game really begins to require a familiarity with the various systems and mechanics and crafting.  There are 4 NG+'s to conquer and an endgame dungeon that increase with difficulty on each depth and goes to depth 138.
[hr][/hr]
Nioh 2's storyline is like if a Japanese historian took acid and wrote a horror alternative timeline, and it makes little sense, there's not much atmosphere like in Nioh 1.  What the game does excel at: it's PURE GAME.  The bosses are the true showcase of the game as theres only like 40 basic enemy types in the game or something small like that, but those enemies are always presented to you in unique and challenging combinations or placements and the difficulty ramping is one of the most fair and consistent I've ever seen in a game, with NG+'s promising even more difficult combinations, placements, and faster rate of fire of ranged monsters.

I still see a lot of reviews and complaints from people who don't quite understand the mechanics or combat fully, or simply think it's too hard which I'm not going to judge anyone if this isn't the game for them for that reason. Yes the scales are tipped against you from the start since even with heavy armor you die in 2-4 regular hits, while even regular enemies might take 6-8, and bosses who might take all the way to above 5 minutes. Still, you can definitely benefit a lot from immersing yourself in the mechanics fully and building a a build that makes sense.

I managed to complete the main story & all side missions on base difficulty at around 80-90 hours, so its a long game for the price tag. Enemies are interesting with very creative designs and move sets, alongside the epic boss battles.

There are quite a few weapon types, with Switchglaive (Scythe) added onto the original list from Nioh 1. Lots of armour/accessory options as well as Guardian spirits (which now come in three unique sub types).

Make no mistake, the game isn't ""easy"" but you learn the core mechanics very quickly and if you are a veteran from the first game, or any Souls-like game, then this will be easy to pick up.

I love the difficulty level. what makes this game terrible is certain enemies will have little to no health, and for some goddamn fucking reason, they just wont die. They have a sliver of health and you hit them one or two times, nope not dead. 

i'm not sure who decided to implement that design, maybe the devs did that to troll the players and to make them rage on purpose but i've been playig video games for over 30 years and there are so many cool things in this game, yet that one thing actually ruins the game for me. There are a couple of other things that are frustrating that don't have anything to do with the difficulty level, i say again i love the difficulty level, but there is a fine line between really hard and mindless stupidity.",1650604954,1650604982,False,2,1,0.413318365812301636,0,True,False,False

After putting over 20 hours into the game I've taken the view that, while it combines some of the elements of Sekiro and DS3, it's really just a worse version of both. 

My opinion is that when you pick up this kind of game the single most important element is the combat. If you come into Nioh 2 with a complete understanding of all the combat mechanics, I could imagine it feels excellent. However, this is a tall ask considering the combat drowns you in endless tutorials which barely scratch the surface including weapons, stances, combos, and special moves. While having some diversity in how you approach combat can feel good, for me this game was dialed up to the extreme where I was completely overwhelmed. I ended up spending a good amount of time reading/ watching basic combat guides (not my favorite thing to do when I first start a game) and still felt like I had the bare minimum understanding to scrape by. The level of detail reminded me of Monster Hunter (except maybe even more complex) but Monster Hunter is nowhere near as difficult allowing you a bit more freedom to figure things out as you go.

In terms of mechanical difficulty, I found most of the game to be fairly difficult, as you might expect of this type of game, although nothing terrible and probably slightly easier than Sekiro or DS3. While it can feel a bit tedious at times to clear out mobs, which is often times required to face mini-bosses that are directly inserted into the level with no private arena, the use of ranged weapons feels really good and makes this far more trivial. The thing that made this game's difficulty feel weird were the absurd difficulty spikes surrounding some of the major bosses. While I might dispatch all the enemies and minibosses in a level/region with ease, I would find myself facing the main story boss that might require hours of attempts to finish. This in itself wasn't a deal-breaker as a difficult boss fight can feel rewarding, but the absurdity of the spikes definitely were frustrating and interrupted the flow of the game.

I can't recommend this game as I feel like there are many others in this genre that just do things better. Unexpectedly, the high point of this game for me was the story which does a neat job of incorporating historical characters and events into a more fantastical world. It's not a terrible game, and if you've exhausted your supply of other Souls-type games and are prepared to embark on the massive learning curve surrounding the combat, you may enjoy this game, but if not, just go play Sekiro.",1650511885,1650511885,False,9,5,0.489053934812545776,0,True,False,False

Incendiary statements aside, wow, this game fucking whips ass. A great improvement over the first, which was already an excellent game. A surprisingly engaging story, too, although that might just be because I already had an interest in Sengoku period history. Even though I was being purposely provocative with saying this game is better than Bloodborne, from a pure gameplay and combat perspective, this game does ""Dark Souls, but more like a character action game"" FAR better than Fromsoft themselves did with Bloodborne and DS3, and I mean believe that statement to be true wholeheartedly. This game ALSO has great build variety, very much unlike DS3, and you can not only respec your ability points and skills as often as you want, but you can even save preset loadouts of said points and skills to swap around at will, which is great. I will say, though, this game's difficulty is very front-loaded, and I would also probably say that this game probably isn't quite as FAIR as Dark Souls, which I think can lead a lot of people to bounce off. Still, once you get properly deep into it, the curve balances out into an extremely satisfying experience.

It takes the basic gameplay loop of the soulsborne genre, and layers technical action game combat and loot showers on top of all of that. All of this together both makes the game great and overwhelming at the same time.

The more technical combat on top of the Souls formula creates a barrier to entry even to veterans of the genre. On top of light and heavy attacks, you've got a bunch of special offensive and defensive moves that you'll want to make good use of to succeed. 

There's also the youkai abilities you have as a shiftling (half-human, half-youkai). These are a pretty simple matter of having an ""anima"" (basically mana) bar that you build by hitting enemies. Then you just press a simple button combination to throw out an ability.

So far so good.

Then we get into the fact that there's three different stances for each weapon, which basically are a matter of how fast or powerful you want your swings to be. Each of these not only have different attack animations, but also have their own set of special attacks, so you need to remember different sets of attacks for each of them. You also carry around two weapons, so you've pretty much got 6 different sets of attacks to keep track of, plus your aforementioned youkai abilities. 

To make things more complicated, a lot of heavy unblockable attacks are stopped with the ""burst counter"" mechanic, where you momentarily shift into youkai form and do one of three different type of defenses (parry, dodge, strike) to counter and stagger the enemy. This is based on which guardian spirit you have active, and you can carry around two spirits, which may have different counters, so you need to be mindful of that to know how to use the counter correctly in the moment. Furthermore, burst counter is used with a button combination involving the youkai ability button (which is fine), [i]but doesn't involve the defend button[/i], which is used in normal counterattacks that you can unlock for your weapon styles.

Your ki (stamina) also notably regens pretty slowly (even with a relatively light weight class), and to get it back rapidly you'll have to make use of the ""ki pulse"" mechanic (where you tap a button to recover a much faster regenerating bar). Honestly, I don't know that this really adds much to the game, other than adding some mental overhead. Though, sometimes you might want to forgo the pulse, or use it at a time where you won't get full recovery because you need to stay on the move, so it does add [i]something[/i]. I just don't know that it really adds all that much, and there's already a lot of things to keep track of in this game.

There's honestly just [i]too much[/i] stuff going on, and it makes the difficulty curve of the game incredibly steep in the beginning, as you try to hammer in all the button combinations and controls into your head. I died [i]a lot[/i] in the beginning to the fact that I kept pressing the wrong button combination to try to get burst counter out, since I intuitively thought it involved the defend button, which it does not. Overall, I died slightly over 300 times in my first play through of the main storyline, which took some 80 to 90 hours. [i]Well[/i] over 200 of those deaths are from the first 50 hours. By the last two main story chapters of the game, I was sight reading the bosses more often than not.

On top of all this is managing your stats, which you're used to in a soulsborne game, [i]and also[/i] your loot that you're constantly showered in. You'll be sifting through pieces of armor to balance your toughness (poise) and agility (weight class that impacts ki use and regen), among other bonus stats, then selling/dismantling literally dozens of pieces of equipment between missions.

The gear curve also seems like it's a little rough in the first play. Unless you know how to build already (which you probably won't if you're a newcomer), bosses will hit super hard and be super hard to hurt. They seem much more difficult than they are later in the game. This may be because I figured out a build by later in the game (and you have more tools at that point), but I'm also pretty sure it's because the gear you get ramps up rapidly toward the end of the storyline. The last main storyline level is recommended for level 114 characters. By that time I had gear that was over level 130, and I didn't do [i]any[/i] farming of any kind for it. Thus, I'm pretty sure I was overgeared without even trying to intentionally get gear above the level of the levels I was playing. I'm fairly certain this contributed heavily to my ability to sight read many of the later storyline bosses.

Nioh 2 is overwhelming. It was honestly too much for me. I actually burned out 50-60 hours in, and only picked up the game again recently (a year later), picking up where I left off. It's not that the game was too hard, I was beating a level or two every night after work, but it was just too much. One night I just didn't fire up the game to keep going, because I felt I wanted to relax, and this game doesn't fit that bill. That was the end of my run up until recently.

There's a lot of things to keep track of in Nioh 2, and it all can make the enemies and levels kind of become pains in the ass. Still, it's all this stuff that [i]also[/i] makes Nioh 2 incredibly rewarding. All the tools and options you have at your disposal allows you to come up with a huge number of ways to build you character and approach each situation. Enemies that smashed your face in over and over and over will be common fodder to you later, and you'll face them more and more the further you get (which also contributes to them being a pain, if I'm being honest).

Nioh 2 is a hard game. It's not for everyone; not even for all fans of the soulsborne genre. It's incredibly well-crafted and beautiful. It's a lot of fun. Just don't go in thinking this [i]just[/i] another soulsborne, because it's not. It's much more than that, and that will be [i]absolutely fantastic[/i] for some people, overwhelming for others, or if you're like me, both fantastic and overwhelming at the same time.

What I didn't expect was the 100+ hour campaign, with about 80 bosses and a billion ways to defeat them. With the amount of variety and depth you can dive into, and for how brutally challenging it all is, I'm surprised Nioh 2 doesn't have more attention nowadays.

Let me put it this way: Nioh 2 is like endurance training at the gym. It only gets heavier and more unbearable as it goes on, testing your resolve and will to go the extra mile. At any point, you could stop. You could give up, say ""I did enough, that's my limit"", and move on. Or, you could climb that metaphorical mountain, taking all the weight you can, working your way to the third expansion, and the final boss.

And if you beat that final boss, the absolute bringer of nightmares that has awaited you for the entire game, it'll feel like the weight of a planet has been lifted off your shoulders. And that's the fun of Nioh 2; the journey, the uphill battle, and that payoff. Now, is the story and world-building that amazing? Objectively, no, but I didn't mind it though. Felt like a Sengoku period Johnny Mnemonic or something, and as someone who actually likes that film for some reason, the story had it's own janky charm.

tl;dr: Good, buy it if you want.

It has incredible combat(better than Dark Souls) and the level of character customization is very high. One of the best games I've played this year. It still has flaws which I will elaborate, but overall highly recommended.

[h1] Review Score:  9/10[/h1]

[u] Pros: [/u]
[list]
    [*]Incredible combat with three fighting styles for 11 weapons with Ninjutsu & Onmyo Magic. Then there are 3 Shiftling(Oni) transformations and even barehanded play-style. Each of them of their own skill tree system you can unlock as you play. There is also several stats for you to raise as you level up! There is no ""bad"" play style, just your own. Fists + Dual Swords are my favorite!

    [*]Being able to play co-op for majority of the game while everyone gets progression together. Too many co-op games don't do this and it ruins the entire experience. I am glad Nioh 2 isn't one of them. Wish there was PvP among friends only, but the Revenant System works fine as is. I always wanted a full co-op Souls like game for long while(Remnants from the ashes is close but not quite the same). Does make the game super easy until you hit Dream of the Wise, that's where the real fun is at with co-op.

    [*]A huge load of content for you to go through, spent hours upon hours playing and still haven't reached the end-game yet. Easy 100 hours to put into the game. NG+ are worth doing since they unlock more content for you to do.

    [*]Extremely high levels of player customization. You can create your own character looks similar to how the Samurai Warriors Empires would do it, but with more control. You can Refashion armor and weapons if something suit your taste. You can make a pretty unique looking samurai/ninja. There is even a sub-reddit on Nioh fashion, that's how good it is.

    [*]Pretty great design on the onis and world. It's feudal japan with demonic influence to it. Majority of weapons & armors look great. Character designs are recognizable if you ever played a Samurai Warriors game. Nothing wrong can really go there. 
[/list]

[u] Cons: [/u]
[list]
    [*]Very weak story-telling. It requires you to have some prior knowledge on Feudal Japan's and Nioh 1's history. It loosely follows the Sengoku Period; VERY loosely. It has it's own spin on history which is interesting, but the lack of bridges between story gaps makes any reader confused. Major events in history are just told in pieces with little to no motivations explained with majority of characters. This creates a dissonance with the player and the story. By the end you only care about like 1 - 4 characters, the rest you don't remember existing at all. Another case of ""show don't tell"" scenario in this game. (The game's weakest aspect)

    [*]The voice acting for the most-part is great as well as the sound design. Though I would have loved more cutscenes and voice acting rather than texts to tell the story. The music is a bit weaker side, there is only a lot of strong music pieces though many of them aren't very memorable. And for those handful ones, they were very outstanding. They are mostly there to set the tone of the scene. Just turn on Samurai Warriors music if you are going to spend all day grinding.

    [*]Extremely grindy to the point of absurdity. The first two NG settings are too easy while the third NG+ is where the true meat of the game is. Every NG+ sort of makes the previous gear weaker and useless in comparison(to an extent). Forging becomes somewhat useless after NG+++, with Divine Weapons being uncraftable. I can understand the first difficulty for beginners but NG+(DOTS) was sort of pointless and just felt like padding... should have skipped to NG++(DOTD). It gets extremely tedious going through the same maps and missions to the point where you get burned out... I highly recommend getting a buddy and trying your best to blast through the first NG+. Doesn't help some enemies has some cheap one hit kill moves, but that's just how this genre works~

    [*]No way to customize armor colors or decals on them... This is the most confusing aspect of the game. With how much this game loves to let you customize your character, it has zero customization for armors. This prevents players from deviating from armor sets preset designs. Doesn't help how certain armors have hidden cosmetic when paired together and ridiculous amounts of silly helmets(yes I know actual samurai had some crazy helmet designs). A very HUGE missed opportunity! 

[/list]

On Sale? 100% Yes. High value.
Peer Pressure? YES. While this game is fun solo-play. It's a lot of fun with friends(try to reach Dream of Wise together, that's where the real co-op fun starts).",1623183165,1648959224,True,6,0,0.556352615356445313,0,True,False,False

Combats fast and fluid and the only thing really hold you back is your own skill. Being able to tailor make your equipment to whatever playstyle you prefer is genius when you learn to actually make equipment and not just sit there and pick whatever just has the highest defense. Nothing feels greater than just gliding around a boss that initially gave you trouble because you didn't do proper ki management and prepare yourself accordingly and just stylishly wailng with no signs of stopping between every single. I am literally writing this after just getting the final achievement and beating the All Comers mission so I am fresh of the adrenaline high and the perfect mindset to writing this. The game is just so fulfilling because it simply rewards skill (unless you're going for a pure paralysis odachi insta kill build or whatever) so that any moment of loss and defeat never feels like the game robbed you but more so you can purely blame yourself. It really doesn't cheese you out and gives you enough options that any fuck up is purely on you. And that's what I love about it. It's just so honest <3.
Graphically, the game is just outstanding from both the levels' aesthetic and characters to the weapon and armor models.
On a technical level, I have only ever suffered two crashes in the entire game and one was caused by multiplayer. I have no problems on boot up, only had one moment after 100 hours of notable frame drop, just had practically no problems.
The only thing this game is missing is just more content cause golly gee I sure do want to play more and even doing Way of The NiOh isn't enough.
All in all, 10/10 game and it's also better than Elden Ring.

Basic enemies kill you in just a couple of hits or a quick combo, while you will hit them 5-6 times at least.That's just a poor way to artificially add difficulty.

Smithing is a mini-game where you just hope to get what you are trying for. Mission based, story driven plot as opposed to a lore based open world or inter-connected world.

If it has a fault, it's that by the time you've done all of the things there are to do (which is a lot unless you skip every optional mission), you will probably be a bit tired of it. Still, there's enough variety here to make it enjoyable for the most part.

Some content from the first game returns, but it feels more like occasional nostalgia than excessive recycling - basic enemies whose absence would be odd, freshened up with updated move sets, for instance, or revamped maps from Nioh 1 appearing for minor side missions.

The core gameplay is the same moderately fast-paced Souls-like action and exploration, coupled with Diablo-esque looting of heaps and heaps of helmets, pants and weapons, all in a vast array of types and a range of qualities. Your spare pants can be sold for cash, offered at a shrine for experience, disassembled at the smithy for parts used to make other kinds of pants... your choices are many, and whatever you want to do, odds are you'll figure out a way to make it work. You pick your play style, your weapon preferences, your magic and ninjutsu abilities, your support items, and of course there's plenty of room to experiment. Dying happens fairly regularly unless you're overpowered for your current mission or just seriously ""in the zone"", but that's Soulsy games for you.

Genre advice: Try to maintain a mentality of ""What did that death teach me?"" and you should be fine. Even if you lose a heap of experience to an unfortunate double death, you can earn it again. With a single death, you can recover your semi-lost experience directly. There's a rare but not unobtainable item that can summon your experience back after death, and some guardian spirits can give you a chance to reclaim it upon death without having to visit the spot where you fell. The game is challenging, difficult, perhaps unfair at times, but overall it does give the player opportunities to survive and enjoy the experience. You'll get better and better at timing and use of your weapons as you play, which can also be a lot of fun.

Overall, highly recommended to anyone who enjoys Soulsy gameplay, Japanese settings and mythology.",1646912090,1646912138,True,18,0,0.626813530921936035,0,True,False,False

As a PC port, it's fine for something that came out of Koei Tecmo who aren't really known for great PC ports.
While it doesn't officially support Windows 7, it can run on it pretty nicely after some file tweaking.

Like the previous game, there's a story going on, but it's not really all that engaging.

The main attraction, of course, is its gameplay. It plays exactly the same as the previous game, with more control options & gameplay mechanics, like the different types of Burst Counters and Yokai Abilities, in case you were already overwhelmed last time by the sheer amount of buttons you were able to press. Though they're not all necessary to get through the game, learning & mastering them does lead to an extremely rewarding & satisfying experience.

The replay value here is just as high‚Äîif not moreso‚Äîthan the previous game, with the higher difficulty NG+ modes making a return‚Äîalong with all the postgame features‚Äîas well some new features to make the game even harder, but slightly more rewarding for yourself, if you're feeling up to it.
The side missions and even in-game achievements aren't as B.S. as before, and there are some fun new weapons to try out in addition to every weapon making a return from the last game.

Compared to the first game, it's not as difficult, but at least it's for very appropriate reasons.
My only real problem with the game is how its level designs constantly try to be Dark Souls in an almost tongue-in-cheek manner, like blocking off a shortcut or parts of a level behind fragile looking doors or tiny gates, or being unable to get loot that's over a 2 ft. ledge.

Edit/addition: personally I'm enjoying Nioh 2 more than Elden Ring due to:

- more interesting levels vs ERs open world
- more interesting combat: special moves, combos, stances, ki management
- more interesting gear: weapon types, weight classes, many stats and procs, set items
- more interesting enemies: human, yokai, interesting bosses
- smoother controls: ER has too many toggles on the left D-pad that are annoying to cycle while moving or in combat. Nioh controls are smooth, natural and don't feel like they get in the way.

Just like Nioh 1 BUT

* More weapons
* More moves
* More armour sets
* More enemy variety
* More boss variety
* More environmental variety

It's a massive evolution for the game and if you enjoyed Nioh 1 then you will absolutely love Nioh 2...

Absolutely brutal in terms of difficulty but you are given plenty of options to overcome the challenges. Just be sure to read the tips, practise in the dojo and learn the Yokai burst counter move...it's ESSENTIAL!!!

Good luck! Will update when I've completed the game...

Update: Added a few more hours. Still fun as hell. Really important to learn that this game is NOT like Dark Souls in the combat. In Dark Souls, you're typically patient and watching stamina usage while making sure you have enough to roll.

Nioh 2 fixes some of the weaknesses Nioh 1 had (like duels against NPCs not feeling very fair even in a Souls-Like sense) and it has introduced new enemies, new weapons, and some more interesting level layouts.  Even if a map is revisited from the previous game at any point, it has been redone from scratch and has new nuance.

The online stuff is a lot smoother and easier to get going than the previous as well.  Ochoko cups are plentiful for calling people in, as you can get 1-3 or so from the dead graves of other players to the point that you can easily have surplus.

If you aren't really feeling it yet it might be because you haven't unlocked combos for your weapon, or maybe you haven't found the stance that fits your playstyle yet.  This game has possibly the deepest combo customization out there, with maybe the only contender being Absolver.

Looks amazing, sounds amazing, and has a more interesting story.  This time you can play as a customized character instead of William from Nioh 1.  Much appreciated and there's awesome gear to choose from.

Some people compare it to dark souls but is fundamentally very different than that. The combat is intricate but flows incredibly well when mastered. I have over 500 hours and there are still a bunch of mechanics and play styles I have not mastered yet. The complexity of the game may very well be daunting at first but it gets very rewarding once you slowly start to get used to the close knitted combat systems. 

The story serves well as both a standalone and a prequel to Nioh 1 through its implementation of real Japanese figures viewed through fictional lens and their reappearances in Nioh 1, which brings about a feeling of nostalgia. The story is a joy ride and I highly recommend not skipping them because it offers a narrative that augments what your motives are at different parts of the game. You could be playing a mission through pure joy or through pure spite, it's all about the narrative. 

The combat is very VERY convoluted but in a way that gets more and more rewarding the more you understand its systems. There are 9 different unique weapons that have their own skill trees. Transitioning from one weapon to another feels daunting but oddly familiar at the same time. Weapons have similar movement inputs which makes the combat feel easier to adapt to.

It's good. Weapons and move sets per weapon all have their utility, and the hit box porn is in evidence. I'm bad at souls likes, but with so many tools to can strategery your way to victory almost always.

Speaking of tools, you can learn skills in a fairly ridiculous skill tree that let you learn how to prepare limited amounts of consumables, in this way don't feel bad about using items if you are like me.

The only thing I don't like is having to farm for potions, in the same way Bloodborne does it. You can buy them, but they are expensive. Thankfully with ""bonfire"" buffs you can farm more than you'll ever need by chapter 3.

As someone who's beaten Nioh 1, Sekiro, the Souls Trilogy and Bloodborne, Nioh 2 felt, for the most part, a really well-balanced experience that has an insane amount of depth to it that the other listed titles don't tap into (Nioh 1 getting close). There was a few rage-y bosses, but it's still a thouroughly enjoyable and rewarding experience. I haven't done any of the sidequests, but if they're anything like the first game's, they're just as meaty as the main quests. I also found the new weapon types really great additions, as well as the re-vamped skill trees. The Soul Core system I didn't really engage with until the final boss (no, seriously) upon which I utterly destroyed him and found them incredibly useful. The other new big addition is the Burst Counter, which was very satisfying as a parry mechanic. 

My only problems with Nioh are just how little the game teaches you about everything at play. The Ki system can be a bit confusing for newcomers, and it doesn't make any effort to teach the Ninjutsu or Omnyo powers, which to this day I still don't know how to get started in. The other major issue is, as mentioned, some of the bosses felt unfair, like they would punish you for their mistakes. I don't know if I was just responding wrong, but I would find some bosses incredibly difficult to punish with any consistency.

Borrows a LOT from Sekiro, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne, but adds a lot of its own ingredients as well. I will never love this as much as I love those games, but it's far from a cheap knock-off.

The gameplay is DEEP, almost to a fault. A lot of players will be turned off by this game, because it has all the difficulty of a FromSoftware title and more than twice the complexity. Right from the beginning, you are managing two primary weapons with three stances each. That's already six distinct movesets to worry about, not including ranged weapons and a huge variety of Yokai shift abilities. This complexity only grows as you level up, with new active skills adding variations to each moveset. It's a lot to memorize very early on. From a game design perspective, it would've been better to start players off with a much simpler experience, and let them unlock stances, secondary weapons, and Yokai shift abilities as they progress through the game. Starting Nioh 2 as a new player, especially with DLCs, feels more like NG+ than a fresh start. My guess is that the developers originally planned for these mechanics to be unlocked later in the game, but had trouble balancing the early-game progression.

Level design is decent, albeit underwhelming. There's plenty of ladder-kicking and ""door does not open from this side"" to keep the genre enthusiasts interested, but each area feels more like an instanced dungeon than part of a contiguous world. There is nothing that connects the different areas together. Instead, you have the arcade-like experience of teleporting to each mission site for a quick linear excursion full of monster-slaying and loot-collecting, and then returning back to home base to take inventory and level up. It is not quite that banal in reality, but that is the overarching gameplay loop. Somehow, Team Ninja and Tecmo still haven't quite escaped their roots in the video arcades of the 80's and 90's.

Remarkably, despite its shortcomings, this game works. The depth of gameplay, once you get familiar with it, results in a very high skill ceiling and plenty to look forward to as you progress. For every aspect that deserved more attention, there is another that received a surplus of attention. There's a lot to admire here that I hope other developers will borrow, which is ironic given that this game is mostly derivative. It's a good game. It will only appeal to a niche audience, but if you're part of that audience, you might find yourself right at home.",1645234582,1645234582,True,3,0,0.540192961692810059,0,True,False,False

You can jump into this without having played Nioh 1, as this is technically a prequel. While it does have a very light tie-in to Nioh 1, it doesn't really spoil anything about the events of Nioh 1.

What separates this from other ""Souls-like"" games for me is:

1) Enemies have a ki (stamina) meter that you can meaningfully use to pivot the fight in your favor. You can deliberately dodge around them and let them tire out, block their attacks, and even use specific weapons or skills to do more ki damage at specific times. Once someone's ki is completely drained, they drop into a vulnerable state where you can do a lot of damage. Having this ki bar always visible on enemies - even on bosses - is so useful.

2) You have way more tools at your disposal for approaching combat. 

      The first of which is that every single weapon has three different move sets -- one for each ""stance"". There's a low, mid, and high stance which you switch between by pressing RB + A, X, or Y. Mid stance is kind of the default with standard speed and ki consumption, but blocking in Mid stance consumes a lot less ki. And the mid stance is the only stance that allows a parry move.

      Low stance has faster attacks, faster dodges, and everything generally uses less ki consumption. All of your attacks, however do less damage.

      High stance has slower attacks and slower dodges, and everything uses more ki. But your attacks do more damage.

      So you can start in mid stance and use blocks to carefully read your opponents moves and attacks, switch to low to dodge around them, and then switch to high to do more damage. Then switch to a different stance depending on the needs of the situation. But the combat can get much more involved as the different moves in different stances can have different functions. Using an odachi specifically gives you access to moves that allow you switch stances mid combo, which can allow for some interesting displays.

      Each weapon also has a skill tree that will enable multiple active use skills for each stance and weapon, and also low grade passive buffs to your weapons or weapon skills. There's even a skill that will allow you to perform a special attack while switching between one of your two melee weapons. You're also allowed to carry two different ranged weapons with limited ammo for each.

      You also have a hype as fuck Yokai Shift (replacing the overpowered Living Weapon from Nioh 1) which lets you temporarily transform into a demon and deal more damaged and stagger. While transformed, damage doesn't reduce your health -- only the amount of time you can stay transformed. So it can be used strategically to deal max damage during a bosses weak point or as a panic button to save yourself right before you're about to die. There's even three different Yokai forms to choose from - one emphasizing damage, one emphasizing speed, and one emphasizing range. And whichever one you pick also dictates how you use your burst counter.

      Burst counter is a special move you perform using RT + B that will interrupt an enemy's burst attack. An incoming burst attack has a distinctive audio cue and a visual cue in the form of a red haze around the enemy's head. Burst counter it successfully, and you'll stop their attack and temporarily stun them, opening them up to be combo'd or giving you a moment to use an item. The yokai shift emphasizing damage gives you a SHOULDER TACKLE burst counter so you can literally interrupt them mid-attack. The yokai shifts emphasizing speed and range give you a parry burst counter, so timing is much more important with those.

      But burst counters cost 1 anima, and the anima gauge is something you charge slowly through attacking and receiving damage. Other than enabling your burst counter, anima is also consumed upon using other yokai abilities that you'll naturally find, test, and equip as you play through the game. There's tons of stuff here -- grab attacks, boulder hurling, fire yoyos, a paralyzing attack -- and each boss even drops a unique yokai ability for you to try.

      And I haven't even gotten into the different armors. or the passive buffs you can roll or reroll on each armor and weapon, or any of the new game+ stuff.

     Essentially, if you found yourself feeling pretty limited on options in Dark Souls - you'll definitely find plenty to sink your teeth into here.",1645169349,1645169349,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story felt lacking initially, in-fact I was almost completely lost. My friend helped explain things as we progressed together. As I became more familiar with the characters, lore, and real-world history, things began to get far more compelling. I was able to appreciate the narrative more in subsequent playthroughs. 
Narrative gripes aside, Nioh 2 has one of the most robust character creations I have ever encountered; quite impressive indeed.
Combat feels great and rewarding for those who take the time to become familiar with it. I never felt forced to use any particular weapon, and could always switch at anytime. I recommend at least sampling every weapon in the game, they are all lots of fun.
The music is really nice and quite immersive. I actually had some of the tracks saved in my music playlist before I ever even played the game. When I stumbled across the music in-game I was pleasantly surprised and had an ""Oh! I know this music!"" moment or three. The music really is great... though I will admit that I think Nioh (1) had a more memorable OST in terms of music that I would frequent even outside of the game. Notable exceptions being Elegy and Lullaby; I quite enjoy them.
The setting and theme is great and really played a large role in why I enjoyed the game so much. Environments range from quite beautiful to very eerie. The grand assortment of armour and weapon designs was quite cool to see and experience.

New weapons like the switchglaive (basically a modal scythe) and the fist/claw weapons (""unarmed"" is my favorite combat style), the fact you can make your own character instead of playing a pre-generated white guy running around Japan, etc. However, the shit I hated most about NiOh1 is here in full swing, with some really annoying friends.

The super obtuse level design, full of invisible walls and hidden critical paths, the 2D minimap that shows almost literally nothing (it can't even do the terrain for the part of the map you're ON; it's completely featureless, except for nondescript blobs that are meant to indicate fog areas where monsters spawn), save for a beam at one point that means ""go vaguely in this direction"", except there's always some dumbshit roundabout path that actually LEADS anywhere, so you still spend a lot of time running around samey environments, covering the same ground repeatedly and looking for the one prescribed path you're supposed to take that they took really bizarre glee in hiding from you.

Once again, 85% of the time you're fighting Yokai, and Yokai are less than half as much fun to fight as dudes. Dudes actually react to your blows and you can actually get combos off on them. Yokai just no-sell your attacks for as long as their little stamina bar isn't empty, and when it is, you CAN stun-lock them, briefly, most of them anyway, until they do an unstoppable attack that usually hits for insane damage, restores their (super-armor) stamina gauge over halfway and sets it about restoring itself. You can disperse those little realms they open, sure, but the fact they get 65% of their stamina  back in a single frame and you're back to the usual wait-attack-wait-attack pattern that you'll use on literally every Yokai. And the same pattern you used on literally every Yokai in the previous game.
Not only that, but, once again, some half of the moves you can unlock in whatever fighting style you're using tend to be throws, grabs, launchers, or other ""cinematic"" attacks. A personal favorite of mine in this game is Battering Ram with the fists, which punches a dude in the solar plexus and launches him fifteen feet in the air. There's a BUNCH of moves like that for each fighting style, and they're all sick-awesome. Guess what? Best get the most out of them in the first quarter/third of the game cuz they don't work on Yokai! Someone had the bright idea to make shitloads of spectacular, awesome, bone-crunching attacks and then decided they should do nothing against ~80% of your enemy base. About as bright an idea as a hydrogen airship, and my enthusiasm to play this went up in about as much flame.
Finally, they switched out the Living Weapon in favor of a Yokai transformation, which WOULD be cool, but for the fact it's weak as shit. Living Weapon was an awesome, excellent desperation attack (or a mode you could swap into if you wanted to just FLEX on fools); Yokai mode is.... Not that. You can upgrade it, certainly, but it levels much more slowly than the rest of your character does (you can't put Amurita into it), and even maxing out damage in minimizing stamina consumption in the mode, you're not gonna be able to kill more than a couple basic enemies (even dudes) or do maybe 7% of a boss' health, on average before you switch back? ""Pathetic"" is the word that kept coming back to me.

I dunno, maybe I'm just too dumb and bad to enjoy these games, but I steamrolled Sekiro and loved basically every minute of it. Even while that game took some getting used to in terms of difficulty and maneuvering, I wanted to keep playing it and I was having fun. It breaks my heart to say it, but NiOh2 I fell off of a little past the halfway point at first. I had thought I just got distracted by another release and didn't want to come back to it, but when I picked it back up almost a year later, it didn't take long to realize that it just felt like a fucking chore to play.

I REALLY want to get into this game, I can imagine its super fun once you get to grips with it - but 14 hours in and it just hasnt clicked - not even remotely. This is a game for people who want to slowly dissect and master every little element with micro precision - which sounds fun but it expects you to do it from the very start.

You know how in dark souls you could kinda wing it for your first playthrough? how the only times you really had to sit down and go ""right, lets figure this out"" was at specific challenges like the Anor Londo archers and the Nameless King in DS3? Well Nioh 2 makes you do that from the start. Its too much.

I wont say its not fun - I think you could have a lot of fun with this game - and I totally see why people love it. But good god its overwhelming to say the least. I need a lie down after playing it for 45 minutes.",1644626668,1644626668,False,4,3,0.473121732473373413,0,True,False,False

Each weapon is distinct and every has three different stances, making it perform differently even as you effortlessly chain between them. Abilities, Onmyo magic, and Ninjutsu all feel fun and satisfying to use. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a more action-packed but still story-rich souls-like.

UPDATE: I am now 86 hours into the game and have only just completed the main questline (I also did all of the side missions). Enemy and boss variety was fantastic. It can be tough to fight the same bosses that you struggled with in the main missions when you re-encounter them later but usually you'll have mostly learned their attack patterns. Slightly disappointed with the relative ease of the final boss compared to some of the earlier bosses but could also be affected by how much better I got at the game.

Upon game completion, you can play through again to earn better gear (Divine/Green rarity) and fight more difficult versions of the same enemies. I am just about to start the DLC as I don't really care much for NG+ style modes (unless the game is short) so we'll see how that goes.

UPDATE 2: As of ~100 hours I am on the last boss of the Tengu's Disciple DLC and am enjoying but still struggling with the fight. The previous bosses were all engaging and interesting to fight with the exception of one human which was easily beatable. The new enemy types in this DLC certainly require a different playstyle than I was employing in the base game but it feels refreshing and none feel totally unfair.",1625872126,1644437144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dodges mostly work as they should, i-frames are very good at low weight. The bosses are challenging enough, and even mini-bosses are fun to fight.
Being able to become a demon temporarily is also nice. Not going to spoil any more. I've only been through 2 main missions and 2 sub missions, but I think I got the hang of the game pretty much.
Weapons and armor drop like rain, so no matter which weapon you choose as your main, you are going to get better and better ones pretty soon. There's of course a blacksmith who can upgrade (or even merge) your weapons.
The leveling is very souls-like. If you haven't played Dark Souls, you should still be able to understand the system pretty fast. There's a ton of tutorials (including a full combat tutorial where you can beat enemies) and pop-ups to guide you.
Anyway, I recommend this game to any action-rpg enjoyers. Personally, I played DDDA, DS1 and DS2 for nearly 1000 hours total, and so far Nioh 2 seems to be at least as good as those 3 games. I bet I'll spent a few hundred hours here.

Update: I now played nearly 150 hours, and can only add that this game is even better than I thought. Once you learn all the mechanics and make a proper build, the game becomes truly enjoyable (not necessary to min-max, just try not to be all over the place and focus on 1-2 main weapons).",1633432039,1644406459,True,5,0,0.586466193199157715,0,True,False,False

Nioh 2 is a hidden gem and should be a household name for any gamer. It is a masterfully crafted action/fighting game, and the game is criminally underhyped. YES, it IS hard - but unlike other games Nioh 2 gives you the tools to handle these challenges, rather than purposefully gimping the player character and using a LACK OF TOOLS to artificially increase the difficulty.

Brief background:
I found the game on my own after moving on from the MMORPG scene (WoW veteran for 15 years) and I was craving something new. I had recently played and enjoyed story driven RPG titles such as The Witcher 3 and Skyrim. The Nioh series is set in feudal Japan, with raging warlords and horrifying demons from Japanese folklore coming together for an interesting take on real historical events.

I suppose technically Nioh is considered a ‚ÄúSoulslike‚Äù game as it has no adjustable difficulty setting, the primary focus of the game is on the combat, which in turn is heavily defined by stamina management, blocking/parrying/dodging. However, upon playing over 300 hours combined between Nioh 1 and 2, I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with this comparison. 

Nioh 2 is definitely a hack-n-slash action title, with Diablo-like RPG elements, and *SOME* Dark Souls inspired gameplay. The game is very hard but has a deep progression system that allows the player to grow into the challenges presented and has extremely fast combat in comparison to Dark Souls or other action titles.

Overall, the game is a worthwhile pickup at full price (and a steal on sale) even if you only intend on playing it one time through. On the upside that you fall in love with it, the game will reward you with countless hours of blissful gaming and will become one your watermark experiences that you compare all other games to.

Overall rating - 9/10 
World design/Aesthetic - 7/10
Combat/Gameplay - 11/10**
Music - 6/10
Replayability - 10/10 
Story/Lore - 5/10

Here are some expanded commentaries on scores, for those interested:

World design/Aesthetic ‚Äì 8/10
Sengoku period Japan is a fun setting with a medieval feel, mixing archetypical Japanese architecture and culture with dark fantasy. It seems like the Japanese equivalent to Arthurian England or Tolkienesque mythology. As a lover of open world RPGs, or even themepark style RPGs, I was admittedly disappointed with the central map graphic and mission style layout for the in-game world. This did not end up being something that I really cared about, the depth of the gameplay easily overshadows this shortcoming.

Combat/Gameplay ‚Äì 11/10
This game has a fast-paced combat design with many different tools at the players disposal to deal with any threat encountered in game as they see fit. A near infinite number of strategies can be developed by the player to cater to their unique play style. Nioh 2 has deep and engaging controls and a thorough progression system. There is an extremely rewarding gameplay loop with an absurdly high skill ceiling (search for PooferLLama on Youtube and you‚Äôll see what I mean). Weapon combos, magic, ninja skills, demon skills, practically all combinations are viable. 

Want to use a broadsword (slow 2H) with magic and light armor? Go for it! Want to be a tanky, heavy armor wearing ninja? Absolutely! How about fighting barehanded while naked? You‚Äôre nuts, but OK! The game has been designed to give you these options and they all work. 

Encounter design is also top notch. Basic thug mobs have interactive mechanics and bosses have an exceptional balance between being challenging but also manageable with the right strategy and preparation. 

Replayability ‚Äì 10/10
Nioh is actually 2 different games in one. Your first playthrough and NG+ is has access to basic armors weapons and features, but in NG++ and beyond there is continued progression through your favorite fighting styles, along with more powerful armors and weapons with bonus perks that significantly affect the way you play the game.  

The more you play the more systems unlock to take on entirely new enemies with increasingly difficult movesets and damage output. This is not a game that simply adds HP and damage to the enemies/bosses and/or neuters the player character to achieve difficulty (see: Elder Scrolls games, GoW4, etc).
The game can get grindy towards the end playthroughs (NG+++++/Underworld), in terms of acquiring resources and specific armor sets for the bonuses you are looking for. But if you have gotten that far, you probably don‚Äôt mind because you‚Äôve already crossed the 100 hour mark in the game.

Music ‚Äì 6/10
Not too much to say here. The music adds to the experiences, but it isn‚Äôt something to rave about.

Story/Lore ‚Äì 5/10
The story is light and doesn't take itself too seriously, the focus on the game is the action. The player character is basically devoid of any real traits, they are simply a vehicle to experience the setting. It is inoffensive and sometimes fun, but lacks depth (This is NOT the Witcher 3 or God of War 4). If you have a specific interest in Sengoku period Japan, samurai and ninjas, or Japanese folklore, the game can be fun as it draws on the actual historical record in regard to events and people of that time, as well as incredibly accurate representations of Japanese demons and other mythological creatures in regards to classical and contemporary renditions in art.

Bonus - Character Creator - 10/10
Absolutely fantastic customization options and beautiful models.

The first Nioh was often described as Dark Souls for weebs, but then Sekiro came out and did it much better. One may ask if Nioh 2 manages to do better than Sekiro did - it doesn't, but that's fine because it only looks like the same kind of game. If you are a Souls fan and think of this as anime Dark Souls, you will be annoyed and disappointed. 

The combat is kinda loose - enemies are over-reliant on hyperarmor and attacks that, depending on circumstances, are both unblockable and can be pretty much undodgeable. The active skills range from useless to gamebreaking and often efficient use of them feels a bit more like cheese than skill. When the AI uses them, it cheats, animation-cancelling into an unblockable hyperarmor iaijutsu that takes off 80% of your health bar. The warts show when the game tries too hard to be difficult, like it's in some weird pissing contest with From Software, but From didn't know about it and went off to do something more interesting.

The key to liking Nioh 2 is understanding that its true heart is not Dark Souls, but instead Diablo. The real core mechanic of the game is coming up with a build, min-maxing your gear around that build, picking all the appropriate buff jutsu, and then polishing your gear into the best possible version. The souls-like stuff is the loop you go through to get the gear, and the reward for better gear is more efficiently getting better gear. I think this actually works because I find the soulslike gameplay more stimulating than diablo-style gameplay.

Ultimately I recommend this game, but specifically that you shamelessly push your way through NG as fast as possible. You have those ochoko cups - use them. Summon constantly, take advantage of the buff items, don't get too attached to any one piece of gear. It'll all be useless the moment you hit NG+, which is where the real game starts.",1638813377,1643347873,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It is basically dark souls set in japan, that uses monsters from japanese folklore, the storyline is told to you straight, and there are a lot of real life historical figures used in it. I'm hard to impress, but this impressed me a lot. 

One minor thing I didn't quite like is that the game missions generate insane amount of loot. It is not like in darksouls where you find your favorite weapon and keep upgrading it, but closer to something like borderlands or cyberpunk. There are weapon types, and over time you'll be finding stronger and stronger version of same  weapon you saw before. It is possible to upgrade previous weapons, but it is extremely expensive.

Anyway. Everything else is grat. Story, cinematics (ton of them), new enemies being introduced pretty much in every mission and so on.

I highly recommend this one.",1643260373,1643260373,True,3,1,0.515025913715362549,0,True,False,False

once you beat the story and enter new game+, they make you do 100 missions where you only care about running to the boss to progress the mission counter to unlock new game++, then 100 again for new game+++, then 100 again for new game++++, you do the same content with more and tougher mobs each time. unfortunately this is some kind of artificial time wasting barrier rather than a challenge. you're not there for the levels; you kill just the boss to advance. normal monsters become a waste of your time, and you have to do this 500+ times.

after all these new game modes, you can unlock a mode where you fight bosses only. too bad, because i'm not going to waste my time walking through 500+ areas to kill a boss and only then experience the game. i wish this mode was available right after the first playthrough.

Nioh 1 is my favorite game and well...
Nioh 2 .. it's good but not even nearly as close to how much i love the first one.
I didn't form no nostalgic feeling to it, just ran and killed mobs and hope for gear and rush it.
No sick cutscenes with bad ass music, no heart racing excitement of beating that fk-hard but fun boss who killed you 16+ times,
The yokai abilities / counter thing is a plus i guess but if you take the assasin form , it counters 1 out of 50 times + it takes out the input of the swap shortcuts on the RT for RB + --> / <--- anyways <.<
 it's good but if you haven't tried the first Nioh , please do !!

EDIT : Scratch that , even singleplayer has random crashs (crash at shrine when trying to access the kodama bazzar

Single player would be a big yes, seemed good on every level.
But shouldn't the multiplayer work as well, possibly better than Nioh 1's ..?
Hyped and hoping for a better port this way around, i've been pretty deceived to see game breaking bugs when playing coop. 
Not being able to hop back in a game after crashing with a buddy is pretty frustrating ngl.
Furthermore the game has been crashing a very big amounts of times.
Those moments of crashes are persistent and can't be avoided
Ie:Same chest crashes the game every single time so have to skip it. 
Can't summon ally revenant without crashing the game again.
Using the whistle emote to get the mimic chest open by himself would make the game crash trying to open when getting back there would also have the same results.
Right now we can't do a main mission because i crash after the cinematic.
I tried alone, no problem no crash.

I pre-ordered the game and was looking forward to this so much..
Please fix the game crashing glitches.

I was debating what game of this gene to try and chose Nioh 2. For me I sure enjoyed many aspects of the game and I have the following remarks to say :
1) the first playthrough was me learning the controls and paterns of the game as well as enjoying the artwork lore and discovering all around. Maybe it took too long because I did everything other than focusing on what gear I was using. I highly suggest you struggle and play the game on your own SOLO. The game has more value like that there isn't always a skip button.
2)Of course if you are completely feed up with something there is a solution and it is called coop. At almost any point you can request help and when someone is available they might join your game and might one hit everything.
3)Having gotten late in the game having access to the entire expansions you can skip all the way to the last difficulty just by using coop. Higher difficulties provide more exp so you don't have to grind for as long.
4)The game can be some what repeatative at times since you will be doing some missions again and again to grind exp/gear since the very last part of the endgame has to be completed on solo. So if you are willing to reach the end you might need to really put in some time.
All in all it was a great choice for me a nice game where you learn from your mistakes strive to get better, with the rpg elements of making your own character and building him/her towards your play style.

At this point, I think I can reasonably conclude that the Dark Souls-esque genre of games is my favourite out of any genre, and Nioh 2 is one of the games that I can place in the top region of that pantheon without much trouble. 

However, though Nioh 2 has many elements of a Souls-like and is extremely well-made, in a sense it is not a game for me. One of the pillars of this game (unlike other Souls-likes) is the eternal loot grind, and getting to the ""true"" endpoint of the gameplay would presumably take over 150 or even over 200 hours. At the time of writing this review, Steam says that I have 63 hours played, but in reality I probably have at least 20 more while in offline mode. At this point, I have completed all the story missions and submissions of the most basic difficulty, as well as the first DLC. But after about 85 hours, I have run out of steam, and will stop playing here. 

Many players would tell me that is unfortunate, because ""Nioh 2 only really starts here."" The ultimate goal of the game is a Diablo-like loot grind, where you get ever more fancifully-coloured gear to get even more effective at killing enemies which also never stop getting stronger. In theory, there are apparently four more playthroughs of this game waiting for me if I wanted to take it to its real, grindfest of a conclusion. But that's not what I come to these games for, to be honest. 

If I had to make a mental representation of the Souls-like Pantheon, I would place Dark Souls I (along with Bloodborne), Sekiro, and Nioh 2 at the top. DS I and Bloodborne have in spades what I look for in these games: truly amazing worlds that you want to explore and feel lonely and oppressed in, which spur you forward to face amazing and horrifying creatures just by the sheer strength of the world building. Sekiro, on the other hand, has less of the worldbuilding and exploration, but it has a highly unique and satisfying combat system that is easily my favourite in the whole constellation of Souls-likes. And then there's Nioh itself.

Nioh 2 has a great combat system in its own right, that finds a balance between the methodical aspects of Dark Souls and the frantic and satisfying action of Ninja Gaiden, which was made by the same developer. As someone who likes the aesthetics of Japanese history and folklore, Nioh's environments for me were also interesting and enjoyable to explore. But it never quite reaches the heights of Dark Souls in terms of sheer joy of exploration, and is also not quite as groundbreaking in terms of combat as Sekiro. Instead, Nioh brings the loot grinding element to the table as something that sets it apart, and unfortunately for me the grind for its own sake does not keep me coming back. 

I died a total of 175 times over about 85 hours. Not too bad: I am a patient player, and find that I click well with the methodical style of the combat in these games, where picking off individual enemies and goading them into more favourable positions is rewarded, as opposed to highly aggressive play. However, just like with the original Nioh, which I also played to completion on the first difficulty level (on PS4), after 85 hours my patience to keep playing well ran out. I felt like I was fighting the same enemies over and over again. This caused me to get impatient (and perhaps overconfident), which led to me running into a wall when the enemies started to hit twice as hard in the transition to the second difficulty playthrough. Maybe the following difficulty levels change their behaviours or movesets significantly, but I have to admit that even by the end of my first playthrough I felt like I was going through the motions with some of the encounters, and the idea of doing that for another 150 hours just to watch the damage numbers of my spear go up does not appeal much to me. I find it hard to imagine how that experience would not feel rote very quickly, and simply making the enemies hit harder, having more of them, and having the game be more punishing in general to me does not sound like an exciting evolution of the gameplay.

Even without being a fan of grinding for loot, this game nonetheless had a lot to offer me. The level design is good, the Japanese temples and castles are evoked to great effect, the combat is excellent, and the story is serviceable. I very much enjoyed going through the game on the base difficulty, which was already plenty challenging. However, the loot aspect ultimately was not for me, and so my journey with this excellent game ends here. I still find it a very easy game to recommend, however.",1641168697,1642369144,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

 Challenge that increases not just damage values, but enemy abilities and attacks as well.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

New mechanics - Yokai abilities and burst counters were brilliant design. Yokai abilities are fun combo extenders and animation cancelling Ki-melting moves and burst counters are satysfying countermoves which also have additional functionalities depending of which type You've choosen - I've picked up fast type which serves as long evasive dash move which can be cancelled from any action. Those two mechanics takes up combat mechanics on another level. Oh and new ''out of ki'' grapple system vs demons is satysfying as hell. 
Gear management got expanded too because new Yokai stuff, more enemy types than in Nioh1 and because that enemy placement became much more varied. Returning enemies got additional movesets.
Dark realm mechanic is nice addition too which makes exploration and boss fights more interesting.
Music is really good, sound design with satysfying meaty hit effects (especially grapples) is great.
Redesigned skill tree needs time to get familiar with it but after a while it became ok.
Specific Nioh atmosphere is still here.
Difficulty is fair - yes, demons got buffed compared to NIoh1, there is Dark realm system which affects difficulty too but player character got so many new powerfull tools so game balances itself in favor of player.

Story and characters are ok, nothing groundbreaking.
While demon bosses are damn well designed (rich movesets, detailed design and animations) the human bosses and standard human enemies are huuuge dissapointment - primitive poor movesets, they aren't designed with new Yokai mechanics in mind. In short - human enemies are boring pushovers and just downgrade compared to Nioh1. Even Hayabusa got butchered and he is just pathetic disgrace to his clan name here.
Pre-abyss equipment sets bonuses are meh, they don't enocourage You to mix-match bonuses like Nioh1 did.
Another sad thing that there is no pvp :/

I don't care about new living weapon system aka yokai shift cuz like in Nioh 1 I don't like those types of ''godmode'' power-ups systems so I've didn't used them. 

Can't write anything about ng+ modes (which were huge game changers in Nioh1) because didn't played them - only finished game once so far.

After all 9/10, great game.

I have about 200 hours on PS, buying this because of... *cough*... culture content... *cough*. To be clear, I play this game and enjoy playing this game as a Masocore no sarcasm, no pun, no joke. Except not as a journey to ""git gud"" but as a never-ending journey of getting my arse kicked no matter how long I play it. Because reaching the peak and have to create challenges by themselves like challenge run or speedrun is when one would getting bored of a game. Such is also why I'm not recommend people getting into this game because of the ""soul-like"" tag.
People will tell you to ""git gud"" but there is only so much ""gud"" you can get. The game have so much artificial difficulty that after spending hours learning a boss fight, you still have to try once and again waiting for the perfect pattern like a speed runner.
Kid you not, after you kill a boss, try that again, you will still get whooped when the pattern is not right. No need to look too far, try peeking in the stream of veterans players when they do ""depths"". It's just a glorified level-normalized boss rush, If you can actually ""git gud"" to a level where gear doesn't matter, these people wouldn't die left and right to bosses they already fought literally hundreds of time. Keep in mind they still have advantage of all the tool from their build (stamina and health recovery being the main part) and moves you unlock as you playing the game.
To name some of the ""difficulty"":
- In mission, at ""recommended level"" and gear, everything can two-shot you, grab attack from bosses one shot you.
- Snipers that are not even visible on your radar can two shot you if you engage with one enemy far away in their ""pack"" (the one-wing bird boss mission, that guy on watch tower), while other time they don't even care if you blast the head of a guy sitting 3 steps away from them (that two Sohaya in the cat finding mission of Hanzo).
- Big wind up attack is not indication to ""get out of the way"" but ""prepare to hit a perfect iframe"", because the hit box will be on top of you no matter which direction you running, and if you block (which you can) you will most likely run out of stamina after the first hit of that big wind up flurry and get kill by the next one or follow-up.
- Hyper armor everywhere, no matter what or who you fight, even after you get them out of stamina human can still just break out of your string and punish with hyper armor while yokai can just enter dark realm to fully replenish their stamina. It is not ""a window during specific attack the enemy have hyper armor"", it's ""a window during specific condition you can flinch enemy"".
- Enemy have infinite consumable (spell, ninja tool, guardian talisman)
- When you transform, each attack take away portion of your transform meter, not just getting hit, so does dodge, block and even just staying in transform. Enemy can stay indefinitely until you deplete their stamina (I'm staring at you Saito).
- Some human enemy can still use healing item despite them already have loads of health.
- Say if you are facing a human enemy, if they attack you and you block, you will run out of stamina. If you hit them and they block you will run out of stamina. Yes, it is not a typo.
- Sometimes enemy will instantly facing you when you pull the trigger of range weapon, which result in moving their weakpoint away from where you aim.
- This is speculation, but to me, more often than not the enemy have chance to perform single-frame-reaction time for block, retaliate during your string and ranged attack to cancel your item (very obvious in Saika fight).
- When you apply elemental to your weapon, you do about sub 100 elemental damage and have to build up elemental status through multiple attack in quick succession. Enemy can deal thousands depend on the move (staring at you, Shiba Inu guy).
- Human bosses have their signature moves that involve them summoning their guardian spirit, they will do elemental damage which pierce your block, and yes, it can one/two shot you.
- Bosses sometime have very gimmick strategy, and when using correct cheese, they are a joke, for example: Switch Glaive/ Gust talisman for Saika to deflect bullet/ bombs, Kusa low stance for Saito, non-lock-on hugging the side of Gyuki and ignore its ""weakpoints"".

And some other minor detail that may tickle most people the wrong way:
- Every time you die, it's not a ""reset"", your consumable are still consumed, and if you out of ""health potion"" stock you will find yourself in a situation where you have to face the same challenge at higher difficulty. You can't just buy potion with money, even though you have loads of them.
- A lot of important mechanic are not explained to the player up-front. To name some: weapon buff stack like Fist's and Switch Glaive's, boss's mechanic like the Gong in Uminyudo fight, the bell in the boar mission, the mimic/ Nurikabe gesture, breakable walls, gear weight, confusion, etc.
- You can't jump and can't swim. water is deadly to Kappa and cliff is deadly to Tengu. You can't step over a 2 foot high fallen tree and have to go around, fighting 5 enemies at mini-boss level to get to the other side. You see a collectible through a human-size gap of a wall of a rotten wooden house that on the verge of collapse and have to climb on top of the house and drop down other side to pick it up.
- Playing without a slot dedicated to Enemy sensor is inviting one-shot from literal ""fall from the sky"" enemies.
- There are no ""retry"" option to restart the fight immediately, you have to do the ""walk of shame"". And if you are learning the game, the walk will most likely longer than the fight.
- Some move have very strict timing and if input at wrong time another move will be performed instead. Twin Blade's God of Wind 3 for example.
- When having FPS issue, the game will not look laggy but it will literally slow down to compensate, thus messing up with your input timing. This and the point above make it hard to play when you have inconsistent FPS.
- Feathers/ Magic are insanely overpowered, if you try the game before and after using feathers, you would feel guilty for using them if this game is not a one-off for you. Bragging with feather builds will most likely discredit what ever you are saying.",1641741857,1642085725,False,7,7,0.458143949508666992,3,True,False,False

~[i]Gargamel[/i][/h1]

I must admit ‚Äì I was looking forward for [b]Nioh 2[/b]. Sure, the first one was pretty much yet another [b]Souls[/b]-like game and we sure had a lot of those lately, but... there was something in it. [b]KOEI TECMO[/b] added their signature touch to our usual formula and, let's just admit it, [b]Souls[/b]-like game in fictionalized Sengoku jidai setting? With all the ayakashi and [b]Guardian Spirits[/b]? It was a very charming experience. The atmosphere, the scale of the story, historical touch, design... Sure, gameplay-wise [b]Nioh[/b] wasn't that special, but like I said, there was something in it. So, even though I rarely look forward for [b]Souls[/b]-like games (not because I don't like them or something, it's just those are not the games you play every day, while, like I already said, there's quite a lot of those around when you need them), I did look forward for this one. Now, here it is and... I must say I'm disappointed.

The first thing you'll notice when you'll start with [b]Nioh 2[/b] is a character creation screen. That's right, no more [b]William Adams[/b] as the main character. We're playing as our own silent avatar called [b]Hide[/b] now. It's not like it's a bad thing by itself and the way our character is written into the story is actually very clever (especially if you know Japanese culture good enough to fully understand it), but... See, the original [b]Nioh[/b] was all about Sengoku jidai. It showed us the end of Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama jidai and the beginning of Tokugawa jidai. And it had everything that makes Sengoku jidai so interesting. It had signature civil war atmosphere, it had intrigues, it had samurai, honor and all of that awesome stuff everybody loves. Now, in [b]Nioh 2[/b]... well...

I can't say that the story here is bad, or something. And it's still following the same time period (the game takes place both before and after the original [b]Nioh[/b]). It's just... it's way too generic and lost most of what used to make the original so impressive. Our hero is half-ayakashi who'll hunt evil and end up playing an important role in Toyotomi Hideyoshi's rise and fall. Quite a lot of historical figures are presented (from [b]Oda Nobunaga[/b] to [b]Abe no Seimei[/b] in one of the [b]DLC[/b]s, don't ask me how's that possible, though), but it won't feel like a fictionalized slice of history. Instead, it'll feel like our usual ‚Äúhalf-demon hunting demons‚Äù thingy. Which is, like, one of the most common motifs in Japanese media. Even if you don't like Japanese stories much, you sure know at least one of those. From [b]Hideyuki Kikuchi[/b]'s [b]Vampire Hunter D[/b] to [b]Devil May Cry[/b] video game series. Such stories are [i]everywhere[/i]. And that's exactly what we've got here.

Sure, [b]Nioh 2[/b] looks pretty neat. Monster design is superb and if you have one of those [b]OLED[/b] TVs with the real [b]HDR[/b], make sure to enable it in this game, because honestly, I've never seen such beautiful [b]HDR[/b] colors in video games before. This game looks like an art and [b]HDR[/b] colors just bring it on the whole new level. But with such a generic story... it's hard not to feel like something's missing. Especially since it'll be impossible not to compare [b]Nioh 2[/b] with its predecessor, which did way better in that matter. Talking about the first [b]Nioh[/b], by the way. In my review I've made a joke about [b]Yuki Midorikawa[/b]'s [b]Natsume Y≈´jin-ch≈ç[/b] ([b]Natsume's Book of Friends[/b]). And guess what? It's time to mention it again. Because, while still being divided by mission, this game works exactly like that. You go through the level, you meet a big and scary enemy, you defeat them and then you listen to their tragic story. Repeat until credits will start rolling. So... yeah. Far from being the best thing you can imagine. Stylish. But that's it. [b]Yuki Midorikawa[/b] turned such an approach into something absolutely fantastic. [b]Nioh 2[/b]? [b]Nioh 2[/b] just turned it into repetitive mess that doesn't give you enough motivation to keep going.

But enough about that. Let's talk about the most important thing ‚Äì the gameplay. Is [b]Nioh 2[/b] good? Well... yeah. But again, it's a huge disappointment. Just because... the game didn't really change that much. I mean, it's not like there won't be any changes at all, it's just in [b]Nioh 2[/b] [b]KOEI TECMO[/b] decided to take [b]CAPCOM[/b] approach. You probably know 'bout that tiny little series called [b]Monster Hunter[/b], right? You know, the one that can consume your whole freakin' life? Well, that's pretty much what we've got here. I don't mean that [b]KOEI TECMO[/b] turned their game into a monster slaying thing (you can always call for help online, though), it's just, like in [b]Monster Hunter[/b] games, they've decided that introducing a couple of new mechanics is more than enough for the next game. In other words, [b]Nioh 2[/b] is pretty much the same exact [b]Nioh 1[/b]. Just with a couple of minor changes.

The biggest difference between the first and second [b]Nioh[/b] is so-called [b]Anima[/b]. A secondary stat that will let you use your ayakashi (y≈çkai) abilities. Which you'll unlock by collecting so-called [b]Soul Cores[/b]. Technically, those are pretty cool, since you'll purify them, fuse them, turn them into fragments and attune them with your [b]Guardian Spirits[/b], but... * sigh * Yeah, it's another disappointment. Because [b]Soul Cores[/b] are way more boring in reality than they look on paper. Long story short ‚Äì you defeat some fat enemies, you get [b]Soul Cores[/b] that drop from 'em and you bring those to nearby shrine to ‚Äúpurify‚Äù them (just a way to prevent you from using them right away, nothing more). Then you either put those on one of your [b]Guardian Spirits[/b] (attunement), fuse them to improve their stats, or break them for shifting skill points. That's it. Not as fun as the one may expect, right?

Talking about shifting, by the way. Again, it looks way better on paper than it does in reality. On paper your character gets possessed by his (or her, since finally, we can make ourselves female avatar in [b]Nioh[/b]) [b]Guardian Spirit[/b] and get access to corresponding abilities. In reality, though, you just press two buttons and turn into one of those generic powerful forms that we've seen in many other games before. Sure, in [b]Nioh 2[/b] it's a bit more tricky thanks to how we can customize and level up that form (see above), but still, it's not really that exciting and fresh as you may hope or expect. And the worst thing? The worst thing is that... that's it. That's pretty much all big changes in [b]Nioh 2[/b]. There's nothing else. Like I said, it's the same exact game with just a couple of new mechanics.

It looks the same, it feels the same and, well, it [i]is[/i] the same. [b]UI[/b] didn't change at all, we've got the same exact stances / shooting mechanics, the straightforward levels are still pretty dumb by [b]Souls[/b]-like standards (the only level that actually feels somewhat like a real deal is the final level from the final [b]DLC[/b] called [b]The First Samurai[/b]) and so on. So, in the end, it's close to impossible not to feel disappointed. Sure, I can't say that [b]Nioh 2[/b] is bad. Because it isn't. It's quite good and the new mechanics totally work. There's no way I can give this game a thumb down and people who don't mind [b]Monster Hunter[/b]-like approach won't even see my problem with this title. Also, like with previous game, [b]Steam[/b] got the complete set. A full game with all three story [b]DLC[/b]s and even some exclusive gear that you can retrieve through the shrine menu. In other words, it's a solid product and [b]Souls[/b] fans would totally enjoy it. And yet, it's a big disappointment. Just because it was hard not to expect more than just a generic story and a couple of new mechanics. Dixi.",1642052278,1642052278,True,6,0,0.514375865459442139,0,True,False,False

I expected it to be similar man was I wrong, not only was the combat different but how you build and the approach that you take. Nioh 2 expanded upon the already glistening gem that was nioh and exceeded expectations. combat feels even more fluent. Magic and Ninjistu had a huge improvement and the reworked skill system seems daunting at first until you give it look through. Being able to gain skill points from combat instead of mashing points into something makes you feel like you have achieved better mechanics.

I went into this game expecting a mediocre ripoff of From's formula, as so many others have done in the past. I was so, SO wrong. This game goes above and beyond all expectations, and simply calling it a souls-like would be a disservice to the game as a whole.

This game is top-notch from head to toe! Every animation, every spell effect, every pixel is just DRIPPING with quality. You can tell a LOT of passion went into this game's world, characters, and story - even for side missions & DLC! So much so that I might actually prefer this game to anything from the Souls series, and that's saying a LOT.

Every quality of life feature you wish From had included in their games, Team Ninja has gone ahead and implemented. But they didn't stop there - they went above and beyond and absolutely crushed expectations. 

Above all else, this game has immense replayability. I'm over 100 hours in my current playthrough and have yet to make the transition to NG+ because of just how much content there is, builds to try, and gear to farm (if you want to). I have never been particularly excited for the NG+ experience in a Souls game, but Nioh 2 makes it incredibly appealing and they handle the whole process far better.

The right person can easily dump 500-1000 hours in this game and not even realize it. Fans of Diablo, Destiny, Borderlands, and the Souls series should all give this a try. Highly, highly recommend!

I love how hard it is and I love how easy you can make it by trying different weapons and builds. The game is hard (especially f&ck the snake lady boss with the horns I hate you), but it's the good kind of hard, it rewards you for being patient and thinking about your actions.

Visually it's beatiful. I don't really follow the story but I know that some of the events are historical Japanese marks with a bit of fantasy.

It is souls-like in the sense that it's a difficult game which you learn by trying repeatedly, but the pace is significantly faster than any souls game to the point where I'd compare it to DMC instead. Don't be discouraged if you die often, it is the type of game that gets a lot easier to play if you watch one or two episodes from a walkthrough (say FightinCowboy's).

The combat is super fun, with tons of depth in the many weapons and auxilliary skills. There are a lot of different enemies with interesting movesets and the level design is excellent, with lots of looping shortcuts and side areas. The story also is interesting with characters you love, all except for the main protag. The protag. is a cardboard cut-out for the player, and although this means that you can control appearance however you want (and the character customization is one of the best), you in-turn get a completely soul-less MC. It's always funny in the cutscenes when something important is happening and off to the side you're just staring blankly.

My last annoyance with the game is the amount of important settings or details buried in the menus. That, on top of the billions of items that drop as you play, is very frustrating.

Luckily, Nioh 2 isn't one of those games.  While it's no stranger to extra features you'll find in many AAA titles, the core game is tightly polished, neatly balanced and a blast to play.  If, then, you decide to keep playing you'll continue to unlock more gameplay progression options through the various NG+ difficulty modes and organically start to interact with crafting and collectibles.  It's a rare game like that: the normal experience is weighty, but it knows what it is.  If you want to plow through the basic game and story, all the extraneous features won't get in the way of that.  In fact, many of them aren't even available.  This allows Nioh to keep tight control over the intended experience while also allowing it to continue on for devoted players.

As a small disclaimer, this is a game that feels like it was built specifically for me: it's a skill-based Samurai action game with tight controls and great character customization.  It has a story, mostly a period character drama spanning decades, but it's largely incoherent and easy to ignore.  Basically, it is the opposite of a game like Ghost of Tsushima, a game I wanted to like but telegraphs the ending about fifteen minutes in and then fails to expand from there.

But my friend grew tired before we could, and frankly, so did I. Nevertheless, after investing ~250 hours into the game, I can say without a shadow of a doubt: [b]Nioh 2 is the best souls-like game currently available on the market.[/b]
Is it perfect? - No, there are no such games. Does it hold in every major game design aspect, delivering quality varying from ‚Äúdecent‚Äù to ‚Äúamazing?‚Äù - Hell yes. 
[list]
[*]Story
Prequel to the original Nioh, Nioh 2 is also set in feudal Japan with a fair pinch of it‚Äôs mythology; mixing the real, historical events with fantasy. This time around, we get to create our (mute) protagonist; a half-man, half-demon [i](did someone say ‚ÄúDMC‚Äù?)[/i]. The overall story is good; it‚Äôs even [i]occasionally[/i]  better than Nioh 1, but in most cases I would say that the first Nioh had a more coherent narrative. Nioh 2‚Äôs story has some badass moments, but overall it is hindered by budget limitations, using ‚Äúfast-forward‚Äù way too often and skipping moments of the story that —Åould‚Äôve been pretty interesting. On the brighter side, it gives the first game a logical conclusion and answers all questions that were left. The DLCs, though‚Ä¶ While I get what the devs wanted to show, [spoiler]time-travel[/spoiler] is still one of the laziest narrative tricks one can use. And ALL three DLCs revolve around it -_-
All in all, the story is of decent quality, especially when compared with most other souls-like games. You know who you are, what you need to do, why you‚Äôre so powerful, who the bad guys are, why exactly they are ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù and all of that without any ‚Äúindirect narrative‚Äù bullshit involved. The main storyline has some nice, memorable characters and even some nice twists.
[*]Gameplay
Nioh 1 on steroids, essentially. More weapons, moves, skills - everything. The devs learned quite a few lessons from the first game: improved economy, simplified and expanded co-op a bit, as well as significantly improved progression and replayability. The only drawback is the removal of PvP, which I suppose was simply too complicated to balance.
For more info you can check out my Nioh 1 review, since the basis remains unchanged - just improved in almost all aspects. Major innovations worth mentioning separately:
-co-op up to three players; this time around you CAN revive from the nearest checkpoint, although you‚Äôll have to sacrifice all the souls you‚Äôve gained during the mission
-Living Weapon is replaced with [strike]Devil Trigger[/strike] temporarily turning into Yokai. There are three classes of Yokai available, based on your Guardian Spirit. It also affects another new mechanic - Yokai Counter; the enemies now have attacks that can only be parried with those counters.
-Overall economy and replayability were improved significantly. You can reroll gear stats much easier and earlier, there are far more ways to replay the old missions in a new, fresh way (backtracking was reduced, as well)
-Proper tooltips for M&K controls, hallelujah!
[*]Graphics
Just like the predecessor, Nioh 2 looks amazing. The level design is awesome (and reuses the same levels for side missions much rarer), the enemy design is superb for both old and new monsters, and all the old/new gear looks just as badass.
Once again I‚Äôll highlight the amazing ability to apply skins of one gear to another; as simple as it sounds, it is an ingenious and for whatever reason - rare sight in modern RPGs with standard looter-shooter/diabloid progression. Found a sword with great stats, that looks bleak and unappealing? - fret not, since you can easily swap it‚Äôs appearance to any sword you‚Äôve found so far. Same goes for armor.
Another credit where credit is due - the game isn‚Äôt hardlocked on 60 FPS anymore! The PC version now supports up to 120 FPS. While it was released with certain issues related to it, most of them did get fixed in the first two months.
[*]Sound
Not much to add here - the sound quality is still great. IMO, the soundtrack even got more badass. What did change, however, is the voice acting. While first Nioh had both Japanese and English-speaking characters, explaining how they understand each-other via lore, Nioh 2 has all characters speaking English. Did it affect the atmosphere? - Personally, I don‚Äôt think so; especially since the quality of the VA is spot on.
[/list]

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
9/10. Best souls-like game currently available on the market, simple as. Most complex and diverse combat system, proper story, great visuals and sound, replayability and proper multiplayer without stupid gimmicks. What more is there to ask? The only reasons for me to [b]not[/b] recommend you Nioh 2 are:
1) If you, for whatever reason, absolutely despise the setting of Feudal Japan and/or it‚Äôs mythology
2) You just don‚Äôt like souls-like games, which is totally fine. Keep in mind that even if you hate complex combat and prefer the incredibly simplistic ‚Äúroll-roll-roll-basic two hit combo-roll-roll-roll‚Äù formula - you CAN play like that in Nioh
3) You hate the rarity loot system in its entirety. I understand this hatred and partially share it, although I have to point out that Nioh 2‚Äôs system is arguably one of the most lenient and least infuriating, safe for the grind at the latest difficulty levels.",1641492872,1641492872,True,2,0,0.523622035980224609,0,True,False,False

Hi :)
This is my first public review so sorry for any typos, missing info or shite i forgot to mention :3
This is MY opinion of the game. hope this helps helps.
also i played the everliving damn out of this game on ps4 back when it came out.

Want to play this? Look interesting to you yes~? 
then just to let you know YOU ARE GONNA DIE... a lot... regardless of how good you get at it, it's gonna beat your shit. THIS GAME CAN BE RAGE INDUCING and it's glorious. It's not dark souls, it feels nothing and plays nothing like the souls games. I Love the SoulsBourne series but this isn't Dark souls, it's Nioh. (i've never played the first nioh btw)

 Have a nice day and i hope you enjoy the read.

LEARNING AND OBSERVATION :D
something of a little advice first :) learn and ultimately ""master"" how the mechanics of combat work (the second enemy you face is good practice), KI PULSE is a feckin must on where to start, if you don't know when to ki pulse you are gonna run out of stamina/KI QUICK and then die muchly.
Timing and knowing when to attack/dodge is too a good thing to learn in this game, it's trial and error sometimes but you get it eventually and after the game becomes much more fun.

STANCES
 You can use 4 'stances' for all weapons which do different roles in combat, you got Low, mid and high stances learn these also and their functions.

1. LOW stance uses very little ki and is for quick attacks, dodges and for taking out weak enemies or just getting in some damage without messing with the enemies KI/stamina. <---(i'll get to why later)
2. MID stance is (in my experience) a damage dealing stance for doling out the hits when an enemies ki is depleted.
3. HIGH stance is for breaking guard and dishing out heavy KI damage but uses much of your own KI to do so.
4. SHEATHED... your weapon is sheathed, you can unlock special attacks for the Sheath Stance.

LEVELLING + SKILL POINTS
As you kill enemies or just using the desired weapon you main you'll get skill points to unlock and access to more advanced combos and moves.
(my advice about weapons...)Pick and test every type out on the first area and get a feel for which one you're gonna stick with because most weapons behave and feel different... an Odachii is a far cry from the splitstaff.

For normal levelling up you'll gain AMRITA of which to spend on various attributes. this nets you increased stats like health, KI and damage with specific weapon types depending on which attribute you'll favour.

KI or STAMINA
ah the joys and pains of enemy/boss KI.

Regular sized enemies (e.g humans, Gaki) have only one bar of KI, when it's drained you'll be able to pull of a ""finisher"" usually killing them in the process.
 Larger enemies have two bars of KI, as you drain the first bar of KI out of larger enemies you'll be able to stagger them as you attack which in turn interrupts their attacks, if you drain the next bar (shown red) you'll drop them and thy'll be vulnerable to a ""finisher"" move that will drain much of their health. if you do not kill the said enemy with the finisher chances are it will regain all it's KI, spawn a dark-realm pool and get enraged.

BOSS KI... same applies to bosses HOWEVER sometimes you DON'T want to drain the KI of bosses cos they can become a massive pain in the ass, gaining VERY annoying/high damaging attacks that it's best avoided as much as you can because it will drain eventually and when it does they'll drag you into the YOKAI REALM where you'll get mildly stunted stamina/KI also special effects and move-sets in favour of the boss will occur. (still fun tho...kinda cool too).

EQUIPMENT + ITEMS
There's tons... like a lot of items you'll just not end up using or remember existed. 

There is a lot Weapon variety in terms of looks and what special effect it places on the table, like lightning, fire, water elements but mostly just stat increases.
As you use weapons you gain ""familiarity"" which increases it's damage and given stats.

Armour is Plentiful and very ""of the era"" looking which is totally fine, light armour will allow your KI to regen much quicker and allow further dodges but offers low toughness which affcts how much damage you take. Heavy armour is cumbersome and your KI won't regen much but allows a bunch more toughness whilst medium armour is a nice balance between both light and heavy, 

KODAMA + SUDAMA
Around every area/level you'll find Kodama hidden (usually well hidden) that you can collect for the shrines in that particular zone which will net you bonus healing drops, certain items, amrita or ammo so long as you activate these buffs at a shrine. 
you'll get a flat percentage increase to drops for the buff you choose at the shrine. there are 5 different kodama to find that are identified by the bowls they wear on their head.

Sudama are little dark realm types of kodama that act as an item exchange, so if you drop say... a blue rarity class weapon, you'll get a diffrent blue class weapon as an exchange and perhaps some extra items with it.
don't attack sudama hehehe...

CHARACTERS+STORY (no spoilers)
For the love of all that is holy who put in charge of the voice acting for the english voice overs?
play in Japanese voices cos the english is kinda bad (especially the part where that guy sings and it sounds nothing like the english voice actor. you'll know what i'm on about...) dont get me wrong, the voice actors do hard work but it just didn't fit here really. Japanese is really top notch though.
anyway...
The game is set in the Sengoku period or ""warring states period"" of japan as war is bungling out and peeps are angry-nasty civil war making. oh and there's yokai... yes.
You are a halfbreed human/yokai and you are pulled into all that excellent historical shite meeting big names in that era i'll not mention.
Characters are cool, i'd look up the history of the era or somert if you're interested in a particular event that happens. 9/10 could use more shrooms.

Art AND DESIGN
Enemies and Yokai look fucking stellar 10/10 (i want a scampuss plushie)
Bosses are FUCKING MOST BODACIOUS 10/10 could use more magic shrooms.
Environments are kinda Here and There... some cool, some not really interesting. 6/10
Characters look Really elegant and flashy and i like it!! 8/10
Armours and weapons are cool in places, basic stuff looks... well...basic but that's fine, the more rare weapons look amazing and sometimes have special visuals to them. 9/10

THE PROTAGONIST!!!!
Silent and Deadly...                            mute...                                 they're mute...
The character creator is actually really good, you can make SO many different looks to your Dude or Lass however you wish and you can change it any time throughout your play-through too so that's cool.

Overall i love this game and i give it a solid 9/10

i hope you enjoyed my godawful review :)
p.s i hope i didn't say anything to offend or anythin.
i got a weird personality... Ok bye.

Up front, the flaws are that there are a lot of loot that most people don't know what to do with; and also that enemies can be cruel in placement, ambushes, grouping up on you with no sense to give you any wiggle room. 

However, this game is more forgiving on the aspect of loot/stats than most people give it. While you do need to have a mild idea of what you're going with, there's no need to min/max or optimize to get through your first three (of five) playthroughs. Seriously, just take this for what it is: a vaguely Souls-esque action RPG that mixed detailed and intricate combat with a most striking and colorful style that makes every encounter feel like art at hour 1 or hour 500.

The Souls-like genre gets a lot of hate for being extremely difficult and requiring a lot of skill to play. I myself did not vibe with Dark Souls 3 due to it's more grounded combat and emphasis on stamina/mana economy with precision strikes. Added on with the enemies and bosses difficulty, the game wasn't satisfying enough for me to keep going.

Nioh 2 fixes those issues with an insane amount of weapons, 14 to be exact, each with it's own fully fleshed out skill tree. Additionally, you can choose to invest in Omyouji Magic, Ninjutsu Techniques, and even choose to fight enemies bare-handed. With just how much content this game throws at you, you can keep playing forever. Bored of one weapon? Just reset your stats and choose another one! The combinations of weapons, skills, stats, and techniques can either make the game easier or harder, and you can gauge how hard you want your play through to be. And don't worry, there are super flashy anime-leveled moves and combos that you can pull off. Plus, the game has 4 tiers of difficulty, acting as its own version of NG+, NG++, and so on going from level 1 to level 750! Also, the amazing character customization is the cherry on top for this game.

I cannot recommend this game enough. There is a reason it won the Steam Awards' ""Best Game You Suck At"" Award.",1641318927,1641318927,True,1,1,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

I am an huge fan of Darksouls 3 and Sekiro, with a few hundred hours gameplay and 100% achievement on both games. However, this game is a huge disappointment, as it is nothing ""Souls-like"". My frustration is mainly on:
- Everything is so colorful, which is huge distraction to the gameplay. Most of the time I have no idea what is going on since both the enemies and my attacks have such robust colors. It is as if the game developers threw in the whole color palette, treating the game like a children coloring book. 
- You can't start the game in offline mode (unless you turn off your internet). As a result, the whole game is desecrated with red and blue graves, which is an eye sore to me.
- Weapon and skill sets are overly complicated. Most of those fancy gimmicks are pointless because you will eventually stick to the same combo or weapon sets which you are comfortable with. 
- All enemies, even the ones at the beginning of the game has hyper-armor when attacking. You need to play that game super defensively in order to minimize the damage taken. 
- The default key bindings for mouse and keyboard is garbage. To add to my frustration, most of the well timed actions required hitting more than 2 keys at once which is absurd. 
- Boss fight is not interesting, tedious, and not satisfying at all. Gozuki boss fight was like one of the most boring fight I had in all the action games I have played. Spammed dodge, attack, and spirit animal for the win. 
- You can't jump in the game. Despite being a Samurai, Ninja, Plumber, Engineer, Astronaut.. You. Cant. Freaking. Jump. Navigating through the map is a pain in the ass. Also, that mini-map is useless as hell. 

Conclusion: 
- Just because a game has the ""Souls-like"" tag does not means the gameplay is similar to DarkSouls. In short, Nioh 2 is an action RPG with a bunch of artificial difficulties to mess with the players. Enemies and bosses has unnecessary high health and damage; weapon and skills are unnecessarily complicated to make the players think that the learning curve is deep. If you want a game that is hard but yet enjoyable, go for Darksouls series or Sekiro instead.",1641220609,1641220609,False,4,4,0.337890803813934326,0,True,False,False

Overview:
- This is a soulsborne. You will die a lot until you get the hang of things. Once you do, like most soulsbornes you will feel quite accomplished and powerful.
- The game is essentially Dark Souls which had a baby with Ninja Gaiden and the new kid inherited the Diablo loot system on top of it.
- Your first playthrough will probably take 40-60 hours depending on your previous Nioh experience (for me it was none) and depending on how completionist you are.
- You do not need to play the first Nioh to understand & perform well in this game, but having played soulsbornes before helps.

The Good:
- 8/10 Combat. Combat is aggressive. Stealth aspects exists, but the game really rewards players for hacking and slashing. ranging down enemies really helps simplify areas.
- 10/10 Loot system. Diablo loot system, with tons of options and rarities. 
- 8/10 Replayability. You would need to NG+, but at least things change. New weapons and enemies etc. A lot to do.
- 7/10 Multiplayer. No shared loot, so thats a plus. You can play with friends, but would like to have seen forced online invasions while you play to add to the pain.
- 9/10 Player customization. Surprisingly abundant choices here.
- 9/10 well made/optimized game. Only experienced 1 minor glitch so far. No lags. 

The Bad:
- 5/10 Story. At least a story exists, but its nothing compelling. I never quite care about characters in the end.
- 6/10 Level design. This is a game heavily focused on combat and RPG elements. Some areas are well designed and nice to look at, but most are basic, and linear. Still wide enough levels to explore and get lost in, but not interconnected. Not an open world game, as other soulsbornes are.
- 5/10 Death penalty. No real penalty for death other than losing the currency you require to level up, and that is only permanently lost when dying again before you retrieve your 'soul'. Another minor inconvenience is losing the consumables used (healing, ranged, etc) and needing to repurchase those.
- 3/10 Yokai shift. Although very cool looking with tons of benefits, it is far too overpowered. You can 'super saiyan' once a gauge is full and it can really make a moderately tough fight trivial, even with the buff being temporary.
- 5/10 Build variation. You are really either a fighter, a mage, or a ninja who uses tons of items. For instance, you can not easily be a ninja and utilize the ninjitsu tree without having to invest into the magic skill to increase your attunement slots. There are ways to blend these to add variations, but not in a noticeably varied way. Katanas are always for builds with the heart skill, glaive for magic skill, etc. Scaling unfortunately does not vary in significant ways within weapon classes and among the plethora of weapons. 

Final Thought:
- Overall, a very satisfying game to play if you are into soulsbornes, and one that I highly recommend. I have not had this much fun with a soulsborne since the actual souls games. Nioh 2 takes the difficulty up on notch and brings it on par with Bloodbourne. Could be more difficult if not for Yokai shifting. Veteran Soulsborne players will find this game moderately difficult, with a few bosses that pose a real challenge. The games length is nice too and there is a lot to do if you wish to keep playing.",1641143765,1641144190,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

COMBAT BEST IN GENRE, EXPLORATION WORSE THAN SOULS, CO-OP WAY BETTER THAN SOULS, LOTS OF MENU MANAGEMENT, LOOT SYSTEM LIKE DIABLO/PATH OF EXILE. NG+ CHANGES THE GAME AND ADDS TONS OF CONTENT ALL THE WAY UP TO NG++++. EXPECT SOMETHING BETWEEN AN ACTION GAME AND A SOULS GAME. FEELS REALLY, REALLY WEIRD IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE JAPANESE AUDIO IMO.

NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO PLAY NIOH 1 TO ENJOY NIOH 2. with this said, if you decide to play nioh 2 before nioh 1, there is very little reason to go back to nioh 1 (it's nioh 1, but better and with more stuff).
nioh 1 and 2 get probably the best praise that i could give a soulslike, which is that they actually feels distinct from the souls series. this review will essentially be for both nioh 1 and 2.
approaching this review under the assumption that you're experienced with FROMsoft's games,

>the nioh games have a far, far more in-depth combat system - to the point that it is probably best approached as being a hybrid between action games and souls-clones. there are fewer classes of weapons, and each weapon in each class is almost completely identical to the others outside of statistics, but every single weapon class has over triple the amount of moves compared to souls games. in addition, the core mechanics of combat have been expanded far beyond that which can be found in dark souls (e.g. the importance of ki damage, enemy weakpoints, ki recovery via ki-pulsing and switching stances, yokai shift, and yokai soul cores), leading to a far higher skill ceiling, reward for skillful play, and variety in combat styles. NIOH HAS THE BEST COMBAT OF ANY SOULS-LIKE BY FAR IF YOU ENJOY ACTION GAMES.

>the nioh games are far more lethally punishing of mistakes in combat than the souls games. while not as prevalent in nioh 2 as nioh 1 (due to a very specific enemy not being as common in the early game), it is safe to assume that you will die far, far more quickly from unskillful play in nioh than in the souls games. with that said, you will be pleased to hear that your bloodstain is automatically picked up the moment you enter a boss arena in nioh 2, and there exists a consumable item to remotely pick up your bloodstain.

>THE ITEM SYSTEM OF NIOH IS MORE AKIN TO DIABLO OR BORDERLANDS THAN DARK SOULS. this is EXTREMELY important to state. in addition, nioh has a staggering amount of menu-management that can easily scare off new players. i would recommend exploring the menus at your own pace and not letting yourself get bogged down by these extra systems. most of them can safely be set aside for at least your first NG cycle without impacting your playthrough. in addition, there exist options for loot filtering and displaying items and all that stuff in the options menu that i HIGHLY suggest you take a look at once you have a few hours under your belt and start feeling comfortable with the basics.

>every single weapon class in nioh scales off of 3 different stats, and have some overlap with other weapons. while the stat system can seem daunting and confusing at first, i can safely state that any build would appreciate having 30 in the health stat, the ki regen stat, and both magic stats, as well as however many stats you need to wield most armors, and the rest into damage-affecting stats for your chosen weapons. with this said, i would advise that you experiment often with different weapon classes to find a playstyle that feels right for you. also, note that consumables to respec your stats can be bought in infinite number from multiple shops, with the teahouse being perhaps the most reliable.

>magic in nioh is implemented as automatically-restocking items, and are (unless specialized into heavily) primarily extremely useful as buffing and debuffing tools. while this lends itself to melee playstyles in expected and unexpected (item canceling for combos) ways, a pure magic playstyle is not as engaging in nioh as it is in souls. on the topic of items, you can have up to 4 available for easy-access at any given time, via the D-pad, and can switch between sets of 4 at a moment's notice.

>CO-OP is supported far better in nioh than in the souls games, but there is NO PVP in nioh 2, and only a seldom-used duel system in nioh 1. in addition to the standard souls-style co-op of summoning phantoms at a checkpoint, you can also set up multiplayer lobbies to run through certain missions completely in co-op, which will give full rewards and mission completion status for all players involved. these allow for reviving downed allies (with the mission failing if the team dies too often or all dies at once), and actually scale the enemy composition and toughness to account for the presence of more players. while these features are not available for all missions, the VAST majority of the game can be played entirely in online co-op, without the clunkiness of repeated runs through the same mission with summon co-ordination like in the souls games.

>the level design in the nioh games, while strong at times and poor at others, is not on the same level as dark souls. there is no open-world navigation or connectivity, as every single mission is contained within its own closed instance, and side missions usually take place on maps that you have already seen before (oftentimes ones that you have just fully explored in a main mission). side missions themselves can vary in quality, from things like ""go through this area with different enemies"" to ""pick a side in a race war between humans and yokai"", to ""1v1 duel versus a ridiculous opponent, no backup"", to ""DMC bloody palace"".

>the nioh games are LONG. if you do all of the side missions (i recommend that you attempt to do as many as you can stomach, to keep pace on levels for your first new game cycle), you will probably be spending about as much time going through your first NG cycle as you would spend in a dark souls 2 playthrough.

>NG+ CYCLES ADD AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF MECHANICS AND CONTENT TO THE GAME, to the point that i would say that your first playthrough on NG is only the tip of the iceberg. entirely new items, an extra item slot (scrolls), stat limits, item effects, tiers of item rarity, set bonuses, enemy composition in main missions, ENEMY MOVESETS, AND AN EXTRA FUCKING GAMEMODE are all added from NG+ to NG++++. you also unlock missions at an accelerated rate on subsequent NG cycles, meaning that you aren't stuck slogging away at a lower NG cycle if what you want to play around with is locked behind something further on. with the addition of a system to save your build's stats and equipment, and the prevalence of respec consumables, there is very little reason to start a new playthrough rather than continuing on to higher new game cycles.

the last thing i'll say is that, if you were put off by nioh 1's extremely noob-stompy first act, or its downright bullshit human bosses in the DLCs, nioh 2 will be far, far more palatable. just don't expect to go into the ""Chinese Bellflower Dagger"" side-mission and have a fun time.",1623014376,1641091748,True,2,0,0.526437759399414063,0,True,False,False

Some high points:
-Combat is fluid and impactful, never feels floaty and disconnected. At least not with my weapon choice, I guess.
-The game is hard but fair. Every time I died, I knew why, and it was my fault. You have to be careful and deliberate any time you get into a fight.
-Tons of secrets around, lots to find on every mission.
-Incredible build diversity potential. There are a million forking paths and a million things to try. And each different build you come up with actually feels and plays different. I'd say there's a lot more diversity here than in Dark Souls, but maybe it's too early for me to tell.
-Playing against invaders is optional but rewarding. There are red graves all over the place where you can challenge an AI-controlled avatar of another player who died there, and they drop loot and glory points (not sure what the glory's for yet tho).
-The cutscenes don't suck.

I played it in a very slow paced manner where I would block/doge the enemy's attack, attack once myself, and then repeat. After all, I picked a fairly slow weapon (Odachi) to use. In Nioh 2, I decided to try a faster weapon: the fists. I enjoyed using this weapon WAY more, and there was a point where I thought Nioh 2 was a 10/10 game as far as gameplay is concerned. It felt like the game combined the challenging bosses of Dark Souls and the fast gameplay of Devil May Cry beautifully. However, as I kept playing the game, I realized that combining both Dark Souls and Devil May Cry had introduced cons as well as pros.

In my opinion, there's two extremes of Hack and Slash type combat: Dark Souls and Devil May Cry. Dark Souls type combat is where the enemies can do a lot of cool shit and are very difficult, but you as the player can't do all that much. Devil May Cry type combat is where you as the player can do a lot of cool shit, but the enemies can't do all that much (or at the very least don't get much opportunity to because you'll destroy them in seconds). I've always thought that the perfect game would involve merging both Dark Souls and Devil May Cry combat. For a while, it seemed like Nioh 2 was this perfect game.

Fundamentally, Nioh 2 has Dark Souls type combat where you can block, dodge, run, parry, and attack. Everything costs stamina so you have to be careful in balancing being offensive and defensive (i.e. if you use too much stamina attacking, you won't have enough stamina to dodge/block). At the same time, pretty much every enemy can kill you in like 2-3 hits (sometimes 1 hit). All of this causes combat to be very methodical, as you have to find the best way to kill enemies while trying to make sure you take as little damage as possible. This causes the gameplay to feel very rewarding, as you can totally feel yourself mastering the enemies you face as you beat them without being hit once.

What sets Nioh 2 apart from Dark Souls and other typical souls-like games is that in addition to your quick and strong attacks, you have access to a variety of attack skills, similar to Devil May Cry. To be clear, you're not exactly going to be doing infinite combos on enemies, since you have a limited amount of stamina and you'll invariably run out after a few attacks. However, having access to different types of attacks gives you different ways to approach/deal with enemies. For example, you might want to use an attack that closes a large distance between you and the enemy. Or you might want to use an attack that does a lot of ki damage. You even have the option of parrying almost any attack! (certain weapons only). This means that the skill ceiling on the offense side of Nioh 2 is a lot higher than something like Dark Souls. I think I was using around 10 different skills while playing Nioh 2, which was absolutely fantastic.

There are also multiple improvements that Nioh 2 makes from its predecessors. Not only does the skill tree in Nioh 2 simply look better, but it also introduces passives that you can equip onto active skills to change their behavior. For example, you can have certain skills do more damage or cost less ki. You can also augment them to do elemental damage like poison or lightning! This system is very cool and I spent a good amount of time thinking how best I should augment all of my skills.

Another major improvement is the loot system. In Nioh, the problem with the loot system was that while there was a lot of QUANTITY of loot, there was very little quality. You pretty much didn't care about ""exotic"" gear (the highest level of rarity up till beating the game) because there were so many trash special effects, it was very unlikely you would ever get a worthwhile exotic. It almost always made more sense to simply equip a higher level weapon since that way you did more damage. In regards to the armor, you didn't care about the rarity but the set bonus. Once you got the set pieces you wanted, you pretty much didn't care about the armor you would get. So basically, you wouldn't REALLY get into the loot system until you finished the game, which is a huge problem. Nioh 2 improves upon this a lot by allowing you to re-roll special effects since the very beginning of the game. This means that you do in fact care about the rarity of gear since higher rarity gear can have a higher number of special effects. It's OK if the special effects are mediocre since you can re-roll and craft a piece of gear to your liking. Within 10-20 hours into the game, I was very regularly re-rolling my weapons and armor in order to get the special effects I wanted. 

In addition to improving upon the loot system that existed in Nioh 1, Nioh 2 also introduces an entire new type of equipment: Yokai Souls. Taking inspiration from Castlevania, each Yokai enemy can drop souls which your character can equip up to 3 of. Each soul provides passive benefits AND allows you to use a unique attack. These unique attacks often do a lot of damage and can cover a wide area, provide unique effects, etc‚Ä¶ As a consequence, these abilities cost ""Anima"", another introduction to the Nioh series. Anima is basically mana, which increases by attacking enemies. So the game essentially encourages you to both be involved in melee combat AND use these new yokai abilities, which is great. For a long time I was looking forward to getting a new soul, finding out what it does, and thinking of the best way to use them against enemies.

While at one point I thought this was a 10/10 game, it seems like this was only the honeymoon phase as my enjoyment from the game eventually started dropping. Fundamentally, this is because the ""Devil May Cry"" aspect of the game simply started taking away too much of the difficulty. At a point, you figure out how best to deal with enemies and you barely ever get scared of dying. I was even facing new enemies and not even caring that I didn't know their moveset. I almost always beat the new enemies on my first try. Hell, I even faced BOSSES and could kill them on the 1st or 2nd try. 

The main reason for this is that all enemies, including bosses, have a type of stamina (ki) bar. Once you deplete it, they will stop what they're doing and be vulnerable to major damage. In Nioh 1, enemies and bosses also had stamina bars. However, apart from a select few instances, it was very difficult to get this stamina bar down to 0. Sure it was possible and a way to approach to dealing with certain enemies, but by no means did this always happen during a boss fight. In Nioh 2, it almost always does. This is because your yokai skills can do some major ki damage, and they don't cost stamina (they cost anima). Therefore, you can chain together regular hits and then use a yokai skill at the end to deplete like 30-50% of a boss's ki gauge. I was regularly facing bosses and they would only get out like 2-3 attacks before their ki gauge was depleted. This meant that I was almost stun-locking bosses, which is insane.

I guess this is the risk of what can happen when you mix Dark Souls with Devil May Cry. At some point, the Devil May Cry can take over and sap too much of the difficulty out of the game. Hell, I can also imagine the reverse happening where the Dark Souls makes it so difficult that you can no longer do cool combos. To be fair, Nioh 2 kept a great balance going for 20-30 hours of the game. That's the length of most games!

Overall, Nioh 2 is a fantastic game. It's not just samurai Dark Souls. This game has a lot of depth thanks to its stances, different attacks, magic skills, ninjutsu skills, yokai abilities, etc‚Ä¶ The list goes on and on.

Good: 
- Its combat system is more complex yet more forgiving than Dark Souls' combat system. 
- The PC version might be the best ""PC port"" of a souls like game I've ever seen, as it allows to play with and use keyboard & mouse properly. The player can choose between the said keyboard & mouse controls or an X-Box or Playstation gamepad. The keys/buttons are always displayed properly, which is not the case in the original Dark Souls games. 
- Tons of loot and costumization options. You can change your characters face, hair, gender etc. any time in your ""hut"".
- Not needed loot can be ""offered to the gods"" (sold/exchanged for useful items such as health potions).
- It has a minimap/radar and a big map in which the player selects his/her next level.
- The more you fight with a weapon the better your character handles it boosting your damage, its passive effects and - as far as I understood - boosting your experience/granting skill points for said weapon. 
- No health penalty after dying. Only the typical loss of money/""souls"" which can be reaquired by interacting with one's point of death/""grave"". 

Neutral:
- The game has not that many options in the graphics menu. Your computer should roughly match the recommanded specs to have a 60 fps performance. I personally had no problems after lowering the shadow's quality and turning of some pretty yet unnecessary graphical options (anti aliasing etc.). 

Bad:
- nothing so far. How could anyone complain about a souls like game with a mixture of historical japanese armor and japanese magic/religion/fantasy?

Loved the first game, but it wasn't perfect. There were fundamentally unbalanced aspects of the game and I was hoping this was addressed. This game is an iteration of the first game with a LOT of reused assets; maps, mobs, movement, skills, characters, and even missions!! With that said, you'd think they have enough time to rework those ungodly things.. But sadly, no, they just copy-pasted whatever they had. 

- 1-hit spear guy is still there, but younger.
- cannons used by mobs still has fire-rate of a pistol and still does massive damage.
- you can still get stun-locked even if you can block attacks in-between (coz let's be honest here, your Ki really cant tank the mobs' Ki damage)
- suddenly getting two-hit by a foot soldier even when you've min/max-ed your heavy armor
- RNG, still there, still sh*t. Grind for gold.

There are a few noticeable additions to these:
- more mercy/invincibility frames.... yaaay! yaaay? 
   not for you, for side-stepping mobs visually getting hit in between the eyes
- playing on controller sometimes feels like inputs aren't registered.
- some skills require perfect timing (no margin of error)
- with new systems in place, more ways to cheese that awfully balanced boss. Boss have unlimited Ki? Summon dem kitties!

The longer I play, the more frustrated I get. For someone who has played DS.. perfected BB... sat through CodeVein.. that rush of adrenaline, that sigh of relief when you beat the boss, and the feeling of achievement afterwards.

Character creator is orders of magnitude better, and while the weapon system means you have less unique weapons than in a Souls game, the weapons' combat capabilities that are here are far more fully fleshed out than anything on offer from Dark Souls or Bloodbourne. 
One area of i'd say weakness is that the game is split into hub based missions, rather than a fully interconnected world; this is a must because of the nature of the story being told, but it also means easier access to co-op and multiplayer options.
One of the Main sticking points for people picking up this game or Nioh 1, is the gear and loot system; Namely that you have the ARPG/Diablo style loot with randomized properties. For the most part you can just ignore this during you first run of new game (pre-DLC) just slap on which ever weapon you find with the biggest number and keep cruising. once you hit NG+ and actually understand more about the game is when i'd suggest taking the time to delve into crafting and by that time you will have amassed a significant amount of the materials to do so.

It took the ideas of the emerging Souls-like genre and blended them loot-grinding and spectacle fighter combat. The result was a game that felt unique and interesting. Nioh 2 is an improvement over the predecessor in pretty much every single way. 

Right off the bat, there's a character creator, so you can create your perfect OC. There are more weapons, so you have even more variety in your character builds, as if Nioh wasn't already generous. The depths in which you can customize your character, aesthetically to gameplay is staggering. 

The combat is even more impressive. Nioh already had a fantastic combat system. Nioh 2 further deepens the combat by giving the player even more options. Its almost overwhelming at times. The skill ceiling with this game is astronomical, and its up to the player to decide how far they want to take it. In fact, the level of depth in combat could be a negative for some players who want a simpler, more streamlined experience. I'm not one of those people, however. 

There are two main complaints for Nioh 2. First is the difficulty. As much as Nioh 2 gives you options, it matches that with punishing enemies. Even regular enemies will destroy you if you're not careful. Bosses in this game are severely challenging - far surpassing most bosses from Soulsborne games. Personally, I didn't mind that difficulty, I'm just pointing that out for people wanting to buy this game. 

The second complaint - one I agree with - is the story. Team Ninja are terrible storytellers; I don't think they've made a single game with a decent narrative. Nioh 2's story is nonsensical. One moment you're a random dude, the next you're a high-ranking samurai under Nobunaga, then your best friend is betraying you. Between levels you'll time-skip 10 years. Characters randomly appear with no introduction and less screentime, then die and you receive exposition afterwards. If you're playing Nioh, you're here for the gameplay, not the compelling lore. That's for sure.

Regardless of complaints, Nioh 2 is easily one of my favorite games of all time. Its a unique compelling experience and I enjoyed it immensely, even as I cussed it out for dying at a boss for the 30th time.",1640313278,1640313357,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The fights can be fun as hell, fluid combat sequences, tons of gear and skills to experiment with and a rather interesting story based on events during the Sengoku period in Japan but ultimately it's a simple case of the cons outweigh the pros. If there ever was a contest for bad boss fight designs I will definitely mention Nioh 2; it started out alright, got better towards mid-game but after that.. I have never experiencedmore rage-inducing boss fights ever, not even in Sekiro. Some of the mechanics are just downright unnecessarily annoying to deal with, not that it is hard to learn the move sets but the design is just cheap and lame. Defeating these bosses just feels like a huge chore to get out of the way, hardly satisfying. Then there's the level designs; half of it is just so... poorly thought out. Bear in mind there is no vaulting over stuff or jumping in Nioh 2 so the ""path"" is basically quite linear. Certain doors cannot be opened from one side to gate your progression using... a thin plank leaning against the door. Certain pathways that connect back for convenience is either simply a large step away or slightly elevated. These things are just so lazily implemented I lost count of how many times I just stopped whatever I was doing and just stared at the spot in bewilderment. I guess I'm writing this review to say, if you're deciding between this or Sekiro, give this a miss first and experience in Sekiro what a top quality game should feel like especially at this price. Nioh 2 is hardly worth $68 here. Maybe get it on a discount, but otherwise it is probably best for your mental health to skip this.
Edit: I need to mention, more often than not the idea of ""increasing difficulty"" = faster enemies that hit harder and putting more of them together in confined spaces. Towards the end of the game you get sent back to the grave by trash mobs more often than bosses. Nothing special to learn about the moves, you fight them almost all the time.

Do yourself a favor and play this game. 

The story and player customization are great but the combat is in a league of its own. Extremely tight controls; much more reactive and with less input lag than games like Dark souls or Monster Hunter. You have a huge arsenal of tools and weapons at your disposal and tons of stuff to unlock. The variation in playstyles allowed is great and almost everything is viable with no real meta builds until the post-game (from what I have heard. I still haven't beaten the game or the DLC yet).

This game is very tedious.  Everything about it is tedious.  Recycled the same environments and enemies so you are fighting the same bad guys in the same places over and over and over... but in a slightly different order so the devs can say ""it is new content!"".
Most games design a world and set up rules that run that world.  This game designed a world, and breaks their own rules whenever.  It is the most annoying way to make difficulty, and a super lazy game design.
Game has no plot.  No characters.  No development or progression.  Complete nonsense (like the first but made worse by the main character now being a mute who just stares blankly at cut-scenes going on around him/her).

Took way longer to finish
Pretty much enjoyed most of what game offered, from combat, enemies to most of locations.
Level design is more forgiving than in Nioh 1
Glad it offered AI summons to help us through campaign and submissions, made some of those boss fights less annoying.
I enjoyed all the DLCs (oburoguma is my favourite enemy in enitre game lol!) and level design is so solid all over the place.

Only things I didn't like were:
- some enemies or bosses doesn't give much time to breathe and they overspam with attacks so I couldn';t cast many spells in fights, interupting animation of casting my spells was way too frustrating like Hayabusa from 2nd DLC or enemy mobs and empowered demons from 3rd DLC submissions
- too much repetition in term of enemies, locations and missions. Game could be definitely better without too much bosses reskin from Nioh1 and locations / bosses re-use from Nioh 2
- not fan of last two trophies (demon parade and way of vanquisher) that I miss and not going to do them since im not bother with playing whole game on ng+ or searching so many missed kodamas from base game
- last submissions of DLC 2 and DLC3 are so brutal and painful that I completly gave up fighting empowered shutten doji or endless enemy waves in Rivals return / Against newcommers
- spirit guard mode is pretty useless (especially in late / end game) comparing to this mechanic in Nioh 1, only yokai skills are useful but it doesn't reward living weapon that was so powerful in previous game

Regardless, I trully enjoyed my Nioh 2 experience. Was amazing and LONG journey to push through.
Definitely recommend for ppl who seek for insane challenges or who played Nioh 1.

PS: Tate eboshi from DLC is one of the most fun bosses to fight with in entire game

I enjoyed Nioh 2 (to a point) but whole game design for me is flawed in many ways, when compared to ""From Software"" game's.
Let me try to explain:
-After 3-4 region's Im physically exhausted with overused assets and grind. This is not Sekiro, where You had temples/caves/villages/castles/mountains etc. that each looked different and had own feel to it. Nioh 2 is  copy paste, and Sub missions are basically same missions with a little different enemy setup.
- Mission system unfortunatelly kills progression, world building and half of ""fun"" of exploration. Each mission start's and end's just like the one before. 
- You'll use same weapon type for most of the game (Due to skill and attribute lock). 
- Way to many cheap ""traps"" in every single map - I got more cheap death's in Nioh2 then in whole DS trilogy. Canon's and archer's agro from 1 km, 
- Difficulty progression is BAD. Game gets easier after each region', not harder. Bosses are unbalanced and some are way to easy, and some way to hard (snake). Boss ""Dark realm phase""  is ""kite for 2 min"" phase tbh. 
I dont feel any kind of DS satisfaction after killing a boss in Nioh. Also, there are no Boss Armour's, weapons or other unique rewards. Only RNG on top of RNG.
- Cyberpunk2077 like equipment RNG...There are more drops than in Diablo 2, and it says alot - You are flooded with boring drops, hundreds of RNG armour's and weapon's You wont ever use and insta sell etc. Also gear is ""inflated"" with levels (attack/defense) so You need to swap everything every couple level's to keep up. 
- Story - It's fragmented to a point I dont know why im doing half of those thing's. In DS we had mistery, in Nioh we got confusion and loads of forgettable characters.

As someone who plays basically every soulslike she can get her hands on, I can say without a doubt that this is far and away the best one.

The weapons have distinct movesets and playstyles, the skill trees and the unusual way weapons scale allow for huge build variety, and the game is gorgeous with HDR. The game expands on the traditional soulslike formula in every way. It's one of the few soulslikes built to allow a full co-op playthrough.

Team Ninja does some questionable things with their other games, but whoever their internal Nioh dev team is seems to be very autonomous-- in a good way. When you play this game you can feel and see the love, thought, and care that went into it. The Nioh 2 dev team absolutely nailed it, did a great job, and listened to fan feedback every step of the way.

The combat is among the best you will find in video games and the spirit of the GOOD Ninja Gaiden games is present in Nioh 2--that is some of the highest praise I can bestow on it. When playing Nioh 2 and seeing the animations, camera angles, how the weapons function etc, it becomes clear that some members of the old Ninja Gaiden crew worked on this or that Team Ninja analyzed and successfully replicated the parts of combat that worked in NG.

Dark Souls carbon copy that adds more functions. The combat situation is new and intuitive but still not enough to justify trying to figure it all out just like Dark Souls. 

It's a sad game and I hate that I support it. 

Can you get good? Sure if you spend the time. I just don't have the time nor patients.

Also fwi, untuned 3rd person games always feel so unresponsive. I don't know if it's the pace of these games, but ever since Resident Evil from the PS1, these Japanese games with 3rd person always make the character feel rugged and slow. Same goes with a few western titles. Mass Effect, Dead Space. A 3rd person game that gets it right is Horizon Zero Dawn and Red Dead. Sure at times it can feel wonky, but it's fast, it's direct, it's fair. You also are not punished severely for what? A gamer boner? No thank you. I'd rather have an enjoyable experience than my Extra Hard Difficulty mode. But if that's for you, with a 3rd person shitty perspective, trying to figure out, only to get it, but realize that it's really just ""Unfair"" and boring gameplay. 

Does it look cool if you figure it out? Sure, but you got to keep at it over and over, and if you're knew to these types of games it's the worst experience imaginable. And if you are lacking in the brain department as myself, you'll be flipping tables with these kinds of games. *Was a Dark Souls 3 player*

Difficulty curve is very fucking steep in some aspects like Ki Pulse and switching stances to maximize your Ki in combat, just know you're in for countless deaths full of frustration and satisfaction once you overcome them.

Graphics: 8.5/10 
The game looks great, nothing like Cyberpunk 2077 or any AAA title out there but the graphics fit the artstyle in this game, the visual design in this game is beautiful to say the very least, yokais look badass as fuck. This game probably has my favorite enemy designs out of all games.

Gameplay: 10/10
Combat is overwhelmingly complex, if you are tired of hack and slash games that only come with 4 moves, this is your game, tons of builds you can experiment with and each weapon feels like they pack a punch.

Music: 7/10
Although nothing really stuck in my head besides the main theme, the music is great for the setting, boss battle osts are also very fitting and get you immersed into the game.

Nioh is this, partly, but it becomes exceedingly clear after the initial surprises that this game is simply Diablo III in 3rd person view. The game is grindy, arcadey, and has the illusion of depth more than any meaningful progression systems like that of Dark Souls. RNG based loot and extremely repetitive ""hit enemy first"" gameplay loops get very very tedious and old after a few hours. 

Yes, you can be a shinobi, but grinding the same identical copy of shinobi gear except with a different level and random stat boosts is an absolute buzzkill. 

This game might be great for hack and slash, MMO, or other such grind-based time waster fans. For me, someone who wants methodical and interesting encounters, uniqueness, and agency, a game based on RNG, gameplay loops, and random drops just does not satisfy. Perhaps I was foolish to expect Dark Souls in a game that is decidedly a hack and slash loot grinder, but that is basically where I stand. 

Nioh is not bad, but it becomes extremely boring after you get over the initial sense of novelty. Sure, the weapons have a ton of moves, but no weapons are truly unique and you will basically run around spamming attacks for hours and hours. By comparison, Dark Souls combat, which has fewer attacks, has a different approach that makes each encounter feel unique. It is more about timing and execution in Dark Souls, whereas Nioh 2 expects giganerd levels of muscle memory in the form of combos, stance shifting, and timing a stamina bar reload (similar to gears of war's reload mechanic). It just feels like a FIGHTING game where you explore meaningless areas. 

No real depth, shallow gameplay, and needlessly complicated features. If the grinding and smithing system is considered ""depth"" by some, I can only say wow. If anything, these features are glorified inventory management minigames.",1638488948,1638488948,False,1,1,0.404343396425247192,0,True,False,False

Some DS mechanics with dying and shrines; re-grinds and ""soul"" like lost punishement for repeat deaths that will have you screaming in agnony.

Memorize the patterns; kite to a certain distance; then counter.  Most battles can be won naked and with a high amount of ""super cheese"" factored in.  Seems less like building out the character; as you are basically a 1 or 3 hit squishy at all times.

Same with various ""others"" in world; figure out pattern; then exploit.

The first boss mechanics were underwhelming; stay mid-distance and then wait for counter.  Wash and repeat about 15 times.

Same you would expect from a Dark Souls game but Nioh 2 adds a different flavor to the mix. Supporting different formulas making it a completely different and unique experience. There are a few minor and some major differences compared to Darksouls. 
1) Blocking is alot more valuable and effective. Blocking in Darksouls felt pointless to me, mainly cause you burn through so much stamina. Even if you could block most or all attacks in Darksouls I barely had any Stamina to attack afterwards.  

2) Bosses health in Nioh 2 can be a bit much. The one thing I always loved about Darksoul games. Is no matter what weapon you used or how low grade it was. It would still do fairy decent damage. Seemed like no boss in Darksouls would take more the 15 to 20 hits to die. Nioh 2 bosses alot hits, depending  how you utilize skills and weapons. 

3) Being Flexibility and versatile is what Nioh 2 shines in the most. It does share weight limits like Darksouls, that hinder speed. But you never have to switch gear for casting or range builds. It's pretty much in all in one package. You Will gradually learn how everything in your arsenal works. 

4) Range with bows is probably the most that stood at to me. It is almost kind of silly on how OP the bows are compared to Darksouls. For one most enemies don't see you from a mile away like in Soul games. Which gives ample time to line up head shots. Which alot times will actually kill enemies out right. In Darksouls I always generally used Bows to pull enemies. In Nioh 2 Ammo is also limited but still felt completely different. In terms of actually being useful.

5) Darksouls games the original ones, actually handicapped you for dying. When you died in Darkouls it would slowly lower a cap to your health as far as -50% health decrease. Nioh 2 can give you a little bit of a leg up. It could randemly let you keep the souls Dropped and also fully charge your oni demon form.  Which can be a huge power up if used right. 

6) Character customization is probably another area I felt Nioh Shined in, same for Code Vein. Darksouls is horrible and always has been when came to that. Nioh 2 is alot more polished in that department There was very little I could find disappointing about it.  The overall quality is beautiful.  

Anyhow I am enjoying the game so far, even if sometimes feel like I want to put my fist through my wall. But hey! what's a Souls game without feeling a little rage from time to time.",1617992626,1638328554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is clean, slick, and fun, the boss battles are satisfying, the combat is surprisingly deep and the movement feels slick, swift, and effortless. And there's a TON of content. Though some side missions are retreads of maps from Nioh 1 or remixes of main missions, things are varied enough to continually remain fresh, especially through later playthroughs thanks to the introduction of curses and set bonuses along with different monster distribution.

I see a lot of comments warning not to compare Dark Souls 3 to Nioh 2 because they are ""completely different games."" This is a lie. Dark Souls 3 and The Sims are completely different games. Aside from both being Action RPGs, Souls and Nioh have a lot in common:

-Almost identical death system. Lose your experience unless you can touch your grave, keep your items.
-Cruel level design full of mostly stationary enemies, traps, and ambushes that encourage luring enemies to you to avoid extra trouble
-Clever donut-shaped level design that use one-way doors and ladders to open shortcuts
-Dark yet eerily beautiful atmosphere.
-Limited healing potion use reset by bonfire/shrine
-Armor encumbrance system that determines speed and stamina regeneration
-Single stat improvement as a leveling system
-Inventory screen does not pause the game
-Useful items that can be bound to the d-pad

...to name a few. Nioh differs in several major areas.

Levels are divided into missions, but they are not linear. Each mission is roughly the size of a unique location in Dark Souls. Many side missions re-shuffle and redecorate existing areas for better or for worse. The story and lore are also more forward, with a monster encyclopedia, cut  scenes, and the like.

Also, where the Nioh series truly shines, is the combat, which is very different and can drive many comfortable Souls veterans away after being punished for trying to dodge-roll away all of their problems. Nioh is not dodge-roll and attack, in fact dodging is a risky maneuver with a larger vulnerability window than invulnerability window. Instead, overwhelming at first, it is a flow of guard, parry, dodging heavy attacks, burst counters, ki-bursts, and grapples. Each encounter feels partially like a fighting game as you react to your enemy. On top of that, ranged weapons are for more than pulling and can eliminate many enemies with  a head-shot, magic and ninjustu are very useful for weakening, healing, and disabling enemies. The blood and gore is also top notch, with a visceral satisfaction to each small victory over your enemies.

The loot system is a randomized Diablo-like, but with more options to control specific stat boosts on equipment. There are a lot of opportunities to have it your way.

Improved over Nioh:

Character creation is top-notch, with all of the sliders to make whoever you want. You can also change the appearance of any armor or weapon to another one that you have discovered, the the fashion options are completely free. You can also recustomize your character entirely at any time from the mission selection area.

Nioh 2 also did away with the horribly fight-two-hard-bosses-at-once side missions, with more measured yet challenging encounters that don't require you to run around in circles waiting for an opening.

The burst counter system and yokai shift system are also new. The burst counter system is essential and adds a lot of flow to yokai combat - in fact the game will be very hard until you develop the burst counter reflex. The yokai shift system is essential to complete the first mission but its power levels out significantly later.

Everything simply ties together for an amazing action RPG experience, which I almost missed because the first two missions are a little too hard. I almost gave up after chipping away at the second boss (until I found something in my inventory). Don't forget to use your tools.",1638244581,1638244581,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Get this game if:
- You want to spend a few hours on character creation (totally optional, but rad),
- You want an extremely in-depth combat system which rivals some fighting games.
- You want balls to the wall character customization, both in looks and mechanically.

The game's combat shines. There's 10 weapons, each with 3 stances, each with a dozen or two moves (most of which you unlock through skill trees), all of which can be combo'd together in various ways. It sounds more intimidating than it actually is: It's not complexity for complexity's sake, even though it might seem to be at first glance. Everything meshes together more and more as the game progresses.

The game's loot is also highly customizable, however this might be seen as a negative to some. There's a LOT of loot to go through in this game - I personally see it as a plus in this context, but some may see it as a negative.

The character customization is ace, offering exactly the right amount of options to let you do what you want without overwhelming you with details which don't make sense. It's incredibly satisfying to see your custom character in the cutscenes in this game, where even facial animation just looks great on any abomination you can come up with. It's a rather underrated feature in my opinion, on a technical level. 

Don't get this game if:
- You strongly dislike inventory management,
- You want an open and interconnected world to explore.

Inventory management and lootsplosions are a thing. While the cap is at 600 items, which will take a while to fill, you do want to either melt down or sell some items, craft others, upgrade these and modify those: It can get overwhelming if you just want to smash demon face. Personally i don't mind, as it feeds into the customization, but some people may find this very frustrating to deal with.

This game does *not* feature an open world: Prepare for lots of loading screens and menus. Don't go into this expecting a leisurely stroll through a large interconnected world to explore as you see fit. The level design of individual levels is great however, though some parts get reused a few times for smaller side missions.

Otherwise: Graphics are technically not the best, but they're very well done (especially NPC faces are quite believable or even realistic), and the art direction is top notch: Everything looks extremely consistent. Aside from some isolated areas in some levels (heavy grass popin or very bland outer boundaries) it's really well done.

Sound is simply great. You learn to appreciate the many audio cues for combat by ear, and the game has some very subtle audio design to help you be aware of your surroundings. The music can be an earwurm: The first two hub areas have an extremely soothing ambience which can easily get stuck in your ears.

For the rest: Well, prepare to die, a lot. But weirdly, dying in this game never feels frustrating, at least not after you've figured out some of its nuances, which can admittedly be frustratingly hard to figure out when you go in blind.

Oh, and unlike some other games in the soulslike genre (but just like other ARPG's) you can co-op this game with up to two friends from start to finish, no need for cumbersome summoning systems :)",1638241853,1638241853,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have done this despite continually getting annoyed at how much bullshit these games can throw at you.  As a new player you'll find the game just absurdly punishing. You'll find enemies in every level that kill you in one hit.  You'll find bosses that drain your ki and kill you because they never stop attacking.  You'll be killed by ridiculous enemy placements, absurd ambushes and gank squads.

After this happens you'll inevitably find yourself asking, ""Why?  Why is it needed to have a bunch of one hit kills?""  And, if you keep going, you'll eventually figure out the answer to that question.  The truth is Nioh gives you such a ridiculous amount of tools that it's impossible to imagine the game having any challenge at all if it played it straight.  In fact your ONLY deaths will be to unfair shit.  And then you'll figure out you have to nuke those enemies with any number of ridiculously OP shit the game gives to you.

About mid way through your first play through you'll have mastered ki pulsing, flux pulsing and the stance system.  You'll have acquired magic and ninjitsu.  And at that moment nothing can kill you fairly.   Instead team Ninja will need to lock you in a room with 7 stun locking enemies to have any chance.

The loot is kind of annoying. The game is deliberately designed to be unfair. The performance is pretty weak.  But the combat is so good none of that really matters.  You just have to let go of the idea that Nioh 2 should be fair.  Instead you have to realize that you and the enemies are both stupidly OP and whichever one cheeses the other wins.",1638232822,1638232822,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Dont mind the hours played on here, Ive played this on ps4 before at about close to 600 hours. For anyone curious as to what this game is about, i will try to go in as much depth as possible with NO SPOILERS

BEFORE I START, if you have not played Nioh 1, I still recommend playing this over the first. Also i need to clarify that although everyone compares this to dark souls because of the stamina, quick death if punished and ""bonfire"" like death mechanic, the combat and overall game is structured very differently. The game does not try to be Dark souls except use some mechanics from it. Instead of an open world, it is broken down into levels and the general idea of the game is mostly loot and combat focused as opposed to adventuring through an immersive world. Looking through youtube would have you think the game is purely build focus killing things as quick as possible but this is only one way of seeing and playing the game. 

PROS--------------------------------------------

- [b] Difficulty [/b] is a perfect mix of punishing but very rewarding. Like Dark Souls, you die a lot early on but once you get further, you survive longer and longer. Difficulty can easily be tweeked by the gear you wear. You can make it extremely easy with certain builds or extremely hard BUT your personal skill and understanding of the combat will outweigh your build any day. You are never stuck having to farm or make a certain build to progress

-[b] Combat [/b] can be approached in any way you want. You are able to equip 2 weapons then can be switched on the fly, 3 stances per weapon with their own moves, Magic, tools, 2 ranged weapons, yokai abilities and transformations ALL at the SAME TIME. Want to play it like Dark souls? Sure! Want to play like a ninja with multiple spells and items? Sure! Want to be aggressive and constantly attack while bob and weaving through theirs for a non stop offense making it seem like youre playing devil may cry?!? Sure! The game has the tools for complexity but does not FORCE you to use it!

-[b] Customization [/b] Not only is the character creator great and character creations can be shared via code but transmog allows you to look exactly how you want with 100s of armor pieces. Visual aside, armor effects allows you to tune your character to your playstyle with a limitless amount of builds plus equipped moves that makes your character completely unique.

-[b] COOP [/b] THE ENTIRE GAME CAN BE PLAYED WITH UP TO 2 OTHER PLAYERS! You can also join random games to help others. As of now, i can find a game easily in less than 10 seconds.

-[b] Enemy [/b] The enemies can be weird, creepy, badass, disgusting or all of thee above. Aside from a few enemies, every enemy seems fair but deadly. Boss fights vary from a gigantic yokai to a human with moves that will test your patience.

-[b] Replayability [/b] The game initially advances from you doing key missions to progress. Side missions are optional but helps leveling up or unlocking unique armors or weapons. When the game is done, you unlock a new difficulty and the ability to get even more rare and stronger weapons. Once you unlock ""Dream of the Nioh"" Difficulty, you gain access to The Underworld, 108 floors that are static levels and 30 randomly generated floors called The Depths. After your first playthrough, they give you the ability to skip pass some missions after progress is done to quickly pick and choose which mission you prefer redoing. Enemies are tougher, some have different moves and new enemies show up in missions.
When it comes to the grind, the game follows a similar diablo/borderlands loot system for weapons, armors, stats and scrolls. Scrolls being small missions where finishing them unlocks extra effects/stats that can be equipped to your character

CONS------------------------------------------

[b] Story [/b] Very unfortunate that it does not deliver. The cutscenes alone can offer an ok story but you will mostly be lost when asking too much questions. Most of the story is told in writing before or after a mission and reading up on the characters in the glossary. There is a great story there but you have to dig for it.

[b] Repetitive?? [/b] Putting this here because i can see how some people may find it repetitive since side missions have you going back to previous areas and people who focus purely on grinding out builds may find the rng annoying since the pool of items is huge. This is why i think you should see this as more of an action game focused on combat than an adventure game similar to dark souls. I came in for the combat and variety of play styles so it never felt repetitive to me

[b] Starting up [/b] The game easily overwhelms people in the beginning with the loads of mechanics it introduces. If that's the case for you, You can go through your first play through ignoring most stats and just equipping whatever has higher defense and attack. Even playing with one stance until your comfortable is fine but the game throws a lot at you in the beginning.

That is all. Hopefully from this review you got a clear understanding of whether or not this game is for you",1638214793,1638215792,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Firstly, Nioh 2 is that Souls-like game, it's as if, FromSoft was too stressed to make Elden Ring, so they force marriage Diablo and Dark Souls. It has the Souls-like gameplay but the loot of Diablo, so every weapon you find will never have the same stats as the one you previously found, which make loot hoarders (such as myself) end up with a full inventory with the same weapon but different effects and stats. It's kinda intuitive but at the same time inconsistent, so sometimes you end up using the sword you previously found when you were lvl 10 than the sword you recently found.

In addition, unlike dark souls, when you play this game, you don't just start somewhere, you have to take it up on ''Quests'', and these ''Quests'' have rewards when you complete it like most ARPGs.

Finally, this is the topic i always wanted to talk about, the combat system. HO-LY SHIT, it's so fucking good, better than dark souls even. In Nioh, Stamina or ''Ki'' can be recovered quickly with the form of ''Ki Pulse'' in which you either change your stance or pressing the RB (for XBOX Controllers or R2 for PS Controllers)  at the right time or with a perk that can make your perfect timed dodge to also recover Ki Pulse. This is a total game changer, because you (almost) can not run out of stamina, after you deplete an enemy's stamina you can punish them with 5-6 hits depending on your Ki or maybe even more, in dark souls you can't do this, you already have a fixed amount of times on how many attacks can you release, after that you either wait for it to recover or get hit. It's very very useful, even parrying and countering could also recover your ki pulse. Speaking of parry, this game has a very unique skill to which you can not parry at very beginning of the game, you have to learn the skill for it, even backstabbing too. Oh and i forgot to mention, this game has something called ''Burst counter'', in which you can counter an enemy when they flash red with your yokai counter, it depends on the enemies tho. Some range burst attacks can not be countered by Feral Counter, so you end up dodging rather than countering, and sometimes the Burst counter does not trigger because of the hitbox idk i'm not a fucking game developer (or maybe i'm just that bad idk) either way you end up taking a bit of damage (sometimes more) so be careful when you try to do this, you could end up killing yourself.

TL;DR: Game's pretty cool, i like the setting of the Game, exploration is also rewarding just like dark souls, though the combat system needs a bit of tweaking, just a teeny tiny bit, i think it's a couple of inches closer to being perfect so good job Koei Tecmo.

I wasn't playing this the right way when I wrote my frustrated review below, but I'm leaving it up, and changing it to a thumbs up.  Why?  Because while I love the game now, I also think a lot of people will be able to relate to the frustration I was experiencing *back then.*   

If you liked Nioh 1, and remember how to play the game, pick this up.  If you didn't like Nioh 1, or the frustrations I outlined below sound like things you would say, then DON'T get the game.  
  
-----

I originally wrote a recommendation for Nioh 2, but now that I'm further into the game I feel that I have to take that recommendation back.  
  
Look, hard but fair games are fun, learning from one's mistakes and getting good is a very rewarding experience.  Nioh 1 was one of the most fun games I've ever played, I put more than five hundred hours into the first game, I played through the campaign three times (NG, NG+, NG++) and while it was absolutely hard as hell, it was also fair, and that fairness made the difficulty and the gameplay much more enjoyable; Nioh 1 is one of my favorite games of all time, bar none.  

Nioh 2 is not Nioh 1.  
  
Where Nioh 1 was fair, Nioh 2 is cheap.  
  
Stun-locks abound, one hit kills are frequent, getting tricked into four dead end death traps in a row isn't uncommon, sometimes the enemies seem like they aren't constrained by the game's mechanics, cheap, unrewarding deaths are the status quo.  ""Oh, you just killed nine mobs in a row, you've got 5hp left, and you're five inches from the shrine (bonfire)?  Sure would be a shame if there was a sniper with a canon just out of view (but within firing range) to blast an atomically accurate canon ball into the middle of your face.""  
  
So how do you overcome this genuinely unfair level of difficulty?  Why with cheese and jank, of course!  

The enemy is staggering you with every hit and you can't win?  Well that's easy, use the High Stance Axe skill, which can't be staggered, and just spam it for the entire fight!  
  
Getting overwhelmed by so many enemies you actually can't target them all?  The solution's simple, summon an NPC visitor and use them as a meat shield!  

Sick and tired of fighting your way to the boss after dying for the thirty seventh time?  Use a speed run scroll and just skip the whole portion of the level leading to the boss!  
  
Yes, with liberal application of jank, cheese, and exploits, you too can ploddingly progress through this unfair, stun-locking, one-shotting, head-sniping, mechanic-ignoring slog of a game!  
  
That's the thing: In a good souls-like deaths teach the player how to play better; in Nioh 1 deaths taught the player how to play better; in Nioh 2 deaths teach the player how to exploit game mechanics to fight against enemies that are also exploiting the game mechanics.   
  
I loved Nioh 1, it's one of the best games I've ever played, and I had five hundred hours of fun playing it.  Nioh 2 is not Nioh 1.",1612638994,1638159643,True,0,0,0.592896640300750732,8,True,False,False

Strengths :
+ The gameplay is nervous, accurate, responsive. Seeing your progress in mastering the gameplay over time is extremely satisfying and motivating. Very cool game design and mechanics with many weapons and situational skills.
+ The graphics are beautiful, the levels are surprising. Many differents places with cities, mountains, temples, with fire, ice, rivers, etc.
+ The story is gripping.
+ You will love the music, sometimes calm and poetic, sometimes epic and violent, but always awesome.
Weaknesses :
- If you really want to understand the story, seriously, open a Japanese history book as the game barely explains a third of what happens between missions...
- Multiplayer is such a cool feature, but it cheese the game a little (especially on bosses, because a tank player can easily get the boss's attention while a damage dealer player will have the free field to slice him from behind in peace).

It can be very addicting to get good at this game and can easily last you hundreds of hours if it clicks with you due to the sheer variance of playstyles that are supported via guardian spirits and yokai abilities.

I have not and was not able to advance to Dream of the Nioh. You can disregard any of the below on the basis that I need to 'git gud'.

+ Best combat out of any Souls-like game created, with a ton of weapon options and move-sets.
+ Fantastic fashion souls (complete with cape/cloth physics!)
+ Great graphics
+ Best character creation out of any Souls-like/Soulsborne game. (IMO Code Vein comes in as a close second, but it's obviously very Anime styled in its look, so it's apples and oranges) It isn't difficult to create a character that doesn't look like an alien. (Looking at you Dark Souls III) Plenty of preset options that look great and can be tweaked. Can even save and share character creation codes so you don't have to stuff around pausing/un-pausing and alt tabbing a youtube guide with sliders. (Again, looking at you Dark Souls III)

- Story and lore can be difficult to follow for those not familiar with the Warring States period.
- ARPG-like gear system. This of course will be personal preference, you might be the type of player that likes ARPG games and/or really enjoys this gearing system. Fortunately for me, this doesn't really matter too much in the base NG cycle, so for your first run through the game and it's three DLC's you can focus on enjoying the other aspects of the game. 

For those who want to advance through all the NG+ cycles right through to the final DotN (Dream of the Nioh) game cycle, you'll likely need to use a meta build and certainly grind for gear drops that give you the set bonuses and sub-stats that you want. It's a fairly intricate system and I would advise that [b]after [/b] you complete the game and it's DLC's on NG to look up one of the detailed guides explaining the forge in detail if this is what you want to do.

Overall, while I prefer the Soulsborne games I still thought Nioh 2 was a fantastic game and well worth playing even at full price. I think it makes for an interesting middle ground for fans of Soulsborne and other Souls-like games to dip their toes in ARPG gearing systems and vice versa.",1637989322,1637989565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some people seem to be experiencing FPS drops, but I can run the game on stable 60fps on my very dated PC.
i7-7700, 16gb DDR4, geforce 1070 and the game installed on an SSD.
The game is running on 1080p with motion blur off (I hate it) and more importantly, effects on low. The rest on high.
It seems like the effects might be bugged or poorly optimized, setting them to low barely makes a difference visually but it has a huge impact on performance.

Many of the negative reviews are about the lack of keyboard prompts, which is a valid complaint but I don't think it is such a big deal, at least not enough for a negative review.

Though Nioh has many differences from From Software's series, the comparisons to Dark Souls are unavoidable.  It has the same exp system, it has a similar stamina system, the combat has a similarly methodical feel to it, and bosses are similarly devastating to the unprepared.  However, it's clear that Koei's game had a much larger budget, and it generally compares favourably against Souls in almost every way, particularly in terms of content and polish.  

One of the biggest differences between the two games lies in terms of progression.  Dark Souls presents the player with an interconnected world that they can explore at their own leisure, while Nioh is instead divided up into distinct stages that are selected from a menu, more akin to the earlier Demon's Souls.  These stages are still generally very large and there are also an absolute ton of them, but it does change the overall feel of the game to some degree.  Nioh also generally has more systems than Dark Souls, it has a much more complex loot system that bares some resemblance to games like Diablo, and there are also complex skill and magic trees that are unlike anything from the Souls series.  Generally speaking, Nioh feels a bit closer to a traditional Action RPG than Souls does.

As mentioned before, Nioh also generally has a lot more content and polish.  It's a much longer game than Dark Souls, with a single playthrough clocking in at somewhere around 100 hours, and it also features an extremely fleshed out new game plus mode where you gain access to new types of equipment and bonus dungeons, again somewhat akin to the difficulty levels in games like Diablo.  It also has far better multiplayer systems.  In Dark Souls, if you want to play muliplayer, you have to go through a clunky process of putting your sign down, fiddling with the password settings so only your friend can see it, summoning them into your world, then keeping the host alive until the next checkpoint, then going back and doing it for the other person.  Although Nioh also allows for this type of play, it also has ""proper"" multiplayer where you can do missions as a team and everyone gets credit for it.  It's also much better balanced than it is in Dark Souls, as Nioh's multiplayer significantly increases the number of enemies and their HP and damage, while also forcing the mission to be completed in one go without the use of checkpoints to balance out the fact that you can revive each other a few times.  Similarly, fighting other players is handled in a far more sensible way where when players die, they leave revenant graves in the game that players can challenge for bonus exp and items, but the phantoms are controlled by the AI, so all of the griefing associated with Souls' invasion system is avoided.  The game also generally does a far better job of explaining how its stats and systems work, with well integrated context help menus and a much better UI.

So far, all of these comments apply equally to Nioh 1 and 2, and indeed, they are fairly similar games for the most part.  Nioh 2 mainly just refines on Nioh 1 and smooths out some of its rough points.  One of the biggest issues with Nioh 1 was that the start was extremely tough, for the first two missions you are unable to level up or access multiplayer, and the boss of the second mission is quite tough for new players.   This is no longer the case in Nioh 2, the starting mission is still challenging, but feels more fair, and levelling and multiplayer are available right from the get-go.  Nioh 2 also adds two new systems related to the half-Yokai nature of the protagonist, the ability to use Soul Cores and to perform Burst Counters.  Soul Cores are items dropped by Yokai that allow you to use one of their special attacks, for example, if you use the Soul Core of Mezuki, the first boss, you can perform a big swing with its saw, while something more simple like Toxic Slime lets you fire a poisonous ball at the enemy.  These are pretty neat and give you a lot more ways to tailor your build to your liking.  Burst Counters are maybe a bit more of a mixed bag, most enemies in the game can now perform a special attack where they flash red, and if you press a specific button combination at the right time, you can counter the attack, avoiding damage and also damaging them a little bit.  This is not totally mandatory, as you can still block or dodge these attacks as normal, and it doesn't occur so frequently as to dominate combat, but it feels slightly superflous and I don't think anyone would miss it if it didn't come back in Nioh 3.  There's also simply a lot more of everything compared to Nioh 1.  The game is longer, there's more weapon types and spells, and so on.

One last area where I have to commend Nioh 2 is its overall value and technical polish.  Many AAA games receive fairly lazy ports to PC that are poorly optimized, loaded up with intrusive DRM, and release long after the console version at a premium price and with a ton of DLC.  Nioh 2 instead launched with all of its DLC included, for a discounted price, completely DRM free, and it's an extremely well-optimized port that looks great, runs great, and isn't overly demanding in terms of computer specs.  It simply feels like Koei respects the PC market a lot more than most of their competitors.  I would normally advise waiting for a sale on most big games, but this is one where you got great value even if you bought it at launch.",1637819602,1637819602,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

I had a blast going through the game and although the end game farming is kinda rough but it's not something undoable, if you know the mechanics. As for bosses, Nioh 1 bosses are better lorewise, difficulty wise but Nioh 2 bosses are more fun to fight against.

The levels, new enemies, new bosses, and are top notch. Plus with all the DLC it's a good value. One of the best releases this year.",1637809101,1637809101,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Nioh 2 is one of if not the best Souls Like gaming experience you will ever have. From the deep complexity of builds, to the fun story set in the Sengoku Era of Japan in the early 1500s  that sets you asa half-yokai named hide who befriends many different characters along the way during the upheaval and warlodism in Japan.

 Nioh 2 takes real dates of the Sengoku Era and characters based on the real life historical figures like;  Kinoshita Toukichirou who later became Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The mixing of fiction and non-fiction is very neat to see and going through the civil war era of Japan and incorporating with Japanese folklore of Yokai (demons) is very fun and interesting spin-off  a real-life era. 

With  over 400 hours in and lots of raging, I want to share my review. 

Combat:

If you have played any Team Ninja (Ninja Gaiden, Nioh 1, Hyrule Warriors) then you know you are already in for a treat when it comes to combat. Like most dark souls the combat is unforgiving to those who don't make time to learn the mechanics of the game. But very rewarding to those who put the time into learn the mechanics, the combos the ins outs of how the game functions during its combat and that's about 90% of the game.

If you played Ninja Gaiden then you already know about the combos, the jutsu/magic and the over top slicing and dicig of your enemies. The combat is probably the best feature in Nioh and makes some of the other Soul like games look like a snore fest.

To say the combat is slow is like saying an airplane doesn't break the sound barrier. It is extremely fast combat, the combos are brutal and coupling it with magic and ninjutsu it can get pretty insane and once you get into New Game + collecting divine gear and start making you build it will get even faster. If done right you can drop big boys in a only a few hits. The combat is a huge step up from the normal souls play and tons of fun if you are into fast paced over the top in your face and melt bodies combos. (I wanted more descriptions but lost em)

With the Nioh Combat you have multiple weapons you can choose from all with their own animations, combos, look feel and play style and as you get better swap between them and pull off some sick combos.

Story:

Nioh 2 is a prequel to Nioh 1 and no you don‚Äôt need to play Nioh 1 to play Nioh 2. It all ties together and fills you in. While I payed somewhat attention to the story, it is actually decent. As you are a half human, half yokai AKA as a shiftling and as you go through you meet and befriend Kinoshita Toukichirou who wants to make his mark in the world by selling sprit stones(Amrita). 

You meet many other interesting characters along the way while fighting back Yokai and evil warlords to gain control of the different regions. The story actually has some really good twists and leaves you with your jaw dropped as you don't expect certain things to happen. For an Souls like ARPG with a story it‚Äôs a decent 7/10 and worth learning about and delving into the lore of the Japan era and the folk lore around the Yokai as it makes it pretty fun to slice Yokai in half knowing what the story around the Yokai are.

Over World Map:

Unlike Darksouls where the game is open and you can traverse the world in any direction (I do prefer this) Nioh 2 kind of does a ""lobby"" style. The lobby is the over map and you move from mission area to mission area from the over world map. While its cool and there are hidden items you can find on the map, I do prefer free roaming the world and exploring. The mission concept is cool and keeps the game moving and but at times can feel disconnected. An example of this is Warfame, your lobby is your ship, the mission ares are the planets you can select and you can too. But Team Ninja's mission are blast and moving from mission to mission is painless and easy and really keeps the game flowing. Some missions are great for items while others are great for farming.

Leveling Up:

This is where Nioh and other Souls games differ and I kind of like it. In Nioh series you get Amrita (Souls) and gold for buying items, crafting, respeccing etc‚Ä¶ Where Amrita is ONLY for leveling your character up. Like souls games, if you die you have chance to get your Amrita and if you die along the way you lose it for good. They do make it so you can find Summoner Candles and Summon your spirit Guardian back to you and all your Amirta.  

Like most soul games, each stat ties to armor and weapons' as well as your magic and ninjutsu. Scaling and leveling up is a whole separate video, but I really like the way Team Ninja took the approach of separating Gold and XP to ensure you can have one resource for leveling up and another resource for crafting, buying items and components. 

Crafting:

After you beat the mission The Beast Born of Smoke and Flames  you then unlock the black smith. From here you can buy, sell, forge equipment, soul forge (make your equipment stronger), you can use soul forging to over write inheritance or add new ones, you can also temper, change move specials effects from gear and armor to compliment your build as well as remodel which lets you change your equipment to scale off of familiarity, your main weapon stat or if you are using a sword which scales via heart, but want a to make a DualBlade + Sword build and want Skill to be your primary stat so you can us the BS have your sword scale off of Skill instead. 

The crafting system is fun unique, and you will spend a lot of your time here praying to RNGesus as you role for certain tempers or forging new weapons etc. As you use  the blacksmith services more you will get patronage points which can be used to reduce costs, increase rare finds, and use patronage points to soul forge instead of gold. Careful soul forging, its expensive and the way you need to upgrade divine gear, you'll go broke fast! (more on crafting and upgrading divine gear at a later time)

To craft new weapons & armor you will be farming for smiting texts. These will come from missions rewards, boss drops and some enemies so you can craft that weapon you want and then role for the stats you want it to perfect your build.

Builds:

Builds are the bread and butter of Nioh 2 and well usually the bread and butter of any ARPG that has stats, loots and an endless grind to obtain the ULTIMATE POWER OF THE GODS! But to be real, builds are everything and almost anything is workable, 

 So don‚Äôt let a subjective build video that says OMG THE BEST 1MIL DMG SWORD BUILD EVERRRRRR! Sway you into playing that way, as some builds are cheesy and while its cool to fart (Tesso) and kill a boss, you lose a lot of what makes Nioh 2 great. That‚Äôs the combat and fun, maybe farting on a boss gets you going, but my point is to just experiment. 

Nioh 2 offers so much from beginning all the way to end game, either at full price or on sale, 34.99 at the time of this review.. get it!",1637806672,1637806766,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TL;DR: I really enjoyed the game. As a person who enjoys souls-like games I feel as though it is a must-buy. The combat was fantastic, each weapon type having their own unique play-style and the story was good enough to keep me interested. I was able to play through the game rocking a solid 60 frames 95% of the time with an RTX 2080 at 4k, though I have definitely heard that others haven't been so lucky. Based on comments from the developer, hopefully that issue will be resolved. Other than that, I found the game to be great.

Deeper look:
The combat is smooth, enjoyable and cinematic with the wide variety of both skills and weapons completely changing the way in which you may play. And trust me when I say there is a LOT of skills to choose from, for every melee weapon, onmyo, ninjitsu and the like. For those coming back to the game you may recognize some skills, but additional skills to weapons that had existed prior have also been introduced, which was a pleasant surprise.

Going off of the first Nioh game, the inclusion of the Yokai Shift adds a lot more variety to the combat, and I found it to be far more interesting than that of the previous Living Weapon system. The addition of Yokai Cores also adds some fun elements in how you may approach defeating foes.

Character creation was good, and allowed for a real decent amount of customization.

Enemy variety was definitely improved, as was boss variety. Definitely a big improvement in comparison to the first Nioh game at least. If you've played the first Nioh game, you'll definitely be running into some familiar faces, but their attack patterns are far more varied than before.

The only negative I had was, as with the first Nioh game, the story was alright. It was decent enough to keep me interested, but I wouldn't exactly buy this game for the story.",1613017940,1637806297,True,6,0,0.568810343742370605,0,True,False,False

- Learn to block instead of dodge through attacks as the invulnerability frames for dodging are a lot tighter in this game.
- Learn to swap stances as needed based on the kind of enemy you are fighting.
- Time your ki pulses to help manage ki after attacks.
- Use your omnyo to buff up and use ninjutsu as appropriate.
- When fighting Yokai, focusing on damaging their ki effectively will go a long way to beating the tougher encounters.
- Keep your gear up to date, as that makes a big difference in power and survival when tackling new missions.

I loved Nioh 1 with all my energy, but at the time, it was a new concept and a new game for me. Going into Nioh 2, I already had the many many hours of Nioh 1 under my belt and some of the game became monotonous because of that. That being said‚Ä¶

Nioh 2 is fantastic. For someone like me, who loves customization, menus, hoarding items and randomly generated effects and powers, this game is my candystory. There is no shortage of weapons and guardian spirits, or secrets within levels. Every mission has back to back refined combat and encounters, and if you ever fail, it can only ever be your fault. 
[i]
BUT
[/i]

The game still suffers from some previous downfalls. There are a finite number of stages and enemies in this game. If you dislike an enemy, boo hoo, you‚Äôre going to see them every other stage. More often than not, side quests will often just be a different route on a stage you‚Äôve already explored but has now reset for the side quest. There isn‚Äôt that many actual bosses, per say, but rather plenty of mini-boss types. The game is much more lenient on letting you pick and choose your playstyle but, in line with its difficulty, if you don‚Äôt full out focus into a certain area, you will lose your power very early on and dramatically, at that.
[b]
In the end, I still highly recommend Nioh 2, especially to new comers. I recommend it to returners as well, but take this with a grain of salt, as you will see a good amount of reused enemies, weapons and areas. [/b]",1637792616,1637792709,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What I enjoy most are the fast and fluid combat and the robust co-op features (Torii Gate). You can actually resurrect each other without resetting the whole level, making co-op more forgiving than Dark Souls, but the difficulty scales with  multiple people in a match (up to 3, including the host), helping to balance things out. 

As I said, the action is fast and skillful, making it really satisfying when you pull off a burst counter or a well-timed grapple. It is a very deep game with a lot of different mechanics, but don't let it intimidate you! Worth the price of admission. :-)

I personally hated nioh 1, I didnt like William that much, I thought the first level of Nioh 1 to a fresh player awful. A very unforgiving and frustrating experience to a lot of people that have not played the game before. The only reason I came back to try Nioh 2 was cause it has a character creator. And it is a VERY good character creator, especially when it comes to hair. The only issue is that the body options were lacking as no matter what choices you alter, your character will always be buff as hell.

Other than the character creator, I enjoyed pretty much everything the game has. I enjoyed the story myself even though it's presentation is very jarring if you don't understand japanese history before hand as there are plenty time skips and characters you might not understand the relevance of unless you know already, I luckily was speaking to japanese history fanatics as I was playing through the game. 

I enjoyed all the combat. Making it to Dream of the Nioh on two saves, which is NG+4, I had to experience a lot of it, both in cooperative and solo play. Strangely the part of combat I didn't really enjoy the longer I played was boss fights. At higher difficulties if you weren't that skillful (like me) they take a lot longer than anticipated. Which is expected as the complexity and depth of the combat system allows for some nutty stuff. Along with the gear system, even though new moves and mechanics are added at later NG+, health and dmg have to be raised to such an extent to still make it a challenging game. I really did love just clearing a level of standard enemies on all difficulties though, it was just fun to fight non boss enemies. 

I've heard a lot of complaints about the, sheer difficulty of Nioh 2 and the ARPG loot system that it has. And the difficulty can be chopped up to just complexity of the game. The game asks a lot more of the player than a standard Souls-like and that attributes to players trying to play the game too similarly to standard souls games and that leads them to not having the full advantage of core mechanics making the game harder than it needs to be. As for the gear system, I could take it or leave it, even though I personally prefer no loot system in this kind of game, I enjoy looters in general so I dont mind dealing with it. I think both the complexity and loot system though are required for it to be a Nioh game as I feel without them, there really wouldn't anything making the game stand out from it's counterparts. 

So all around I do enjoy pretty much everything about this game, EXCEPT human bosses. That is the biggest gripe I have with it. I dislike that they are the only bosses that don't obey the mechanics and standards of combat flow. Yokai bosses fight like standard yokai enemies except tougher. Human bosses DON'T fight like standard human enemies and have abusive Ki capabilities that can really make a player struggle on them.

Easy to learn hard to master is the name of the game and even if you don't manage to master the combat, you can always master the equipment system.

For those who maybe bounced off Nioh1 (understandable, since its difficulty curve was at times BONKERS) will maybe find Nioh 2 smoother to ease into.  And for those unfamiliar with its predecessor, but craving metroidvanias or Dark Souls-likes, the Nioh series is easily among the best of them since not only does it scratch that specific itch, but it also gives you upfront information in its menus/stats, much needed qol, and so much more that Fromsoft could stand to take a few notes on for their own future iterations.

Nioh's whole stance system and skills are just as customizable as they were in one, but now we also get Yokai abilities, which are essentially just attacks that we can copy from *any* demon enemy or boss, which not only further fleshout your moveset, but said abilities come with their own meter, passives, and bonuses that compliment different loadouts too!  The guardian spirit skills from 1 are less overpowered now, but your general gameplay without that limited-god mode are elevated such that it more than makes up for it by being more engaging.

Also, multiplayer in this game is just an actual blast?  Not only does Nioh cut out DS's bullshit where you summon me, we beat the boss, AND THEN I have to summon you and then we do it again, progress is maintained for the both of us so we're not repeating levels twice over.  Unlike DS's humanity, which CAN be expended almost completely in the early parts of the game and thus deny you out of coop, kicking you while you're already down...Nioh just lets you play with people.  What an alien concept.

Not only is the use of expeditions (coop) just more sensical, it also adds fun stipulations.  Enemies are *slightly* remixed around in their multiplayer versions of the map, compared to the single player ones, keeping veterans on their toes.  Furthermore, the heals and other consumables which typically replenish themselves become limited, only replenishing ONCE at every checkpoint you reach, so while, yes you have twice as much dps, and can do satsifying combos where you and your friend just jump unsuspecting dudes, you can't just faceroll the level with your friend (unless one of you is drastically overleveled).
(Minor note, it does cost a specific resource to summon people MID single player missions, but said resource is incredibly easy to come by and is essentially unlimited.)

There's also just an insane amount of content in this game?  Similar to multiplayer, NG+ and NG++ not only upscales the enemies but slightly remixes their placements and swaps around what types of enemies are where.  And to keep things fresh on these NG+ cycles, you're given ample opppurtunity to just respec your stats, your skills, your character's looks, like, basically whenever.  Skills and stats cost resources but like, short of being the most indecisive person who respecs 10 times over, it's a non issue and encourages you to experiment.",1637187177,1637396893,True,24,0,0.674008607864379883,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Random Loot makes it more interesting to go through more runs in missions
+ Custom moveset allows a more personal kit beyond simple choices like weapon.
+ slow OR faster progressions are taken into consideration, as the game allows you to either go through the game with no replaying, or to farm a mission till you are comfortable,
+ OST is amazing and fitting.
+ New Game + genuinely feels like a new experience with certain parts
+ Multiplayer that is actually more than Dark souls' ""pleas take me to boss and kill for me :(""
+ A smithing text system to decrease the grind or make it easier to obtain a weapon/armor that is favored.

Neutrals:
/Doesn't have PVP *at all*. Though this means that players who never liked invasions or PVP don't have to be forced.
/ Mission system changes the flow entirely, whether it be for the good or bad.
/ No ""real"" quests per say for NPCs besides ""do this mission then this mission. speak to my ghost in some weird limbo world now.""

Cons:
- Falls in similar shortcomings DS games do
- Story feels too short, even with DLC
- Clan system is extremely flawed, with no anti-cheat to prevent clans from inflating their score, and having unbalanced buffs leading to one clan absolutely dominating every time.
- Due to randomized drops, it may take ages before the player can find what they're looking for.

-No loot vacuum. This is easily my biggest annoyance with the game. you're constantly picking up stuff and needing to press a button shouldn't be necessary. The B button on my new Xbox controller already feels worn out. *Soul cores are fine as is 
-Too much menu management. Mainly referring to the blacksmith here. The diablo style loot means you'll be spending an excessive amount of time managing your equipment instead of having fun fighting enemies out in the field. 
-All weapons need stance switching attacks like the switchglaive. Every weapon would feel vastly more fluid as a result. 
-Yokai Shift feels overbalanced. Especially in the early game. 
-Certain Yokai abilities and weapon skills are underpowered. 
-Guardian Spirit & Yokai shift form are linked. These two things should be separately customizable. 
-Various blacksmith functions don't scale into higher NG+s. The special finds tab is almost always junk and whenever you forge something it starts at +0.

Ninjutsu and Omnyo magic make their return and have very satisfying FX to them. And Yokai Abilities are use-frequently powerhouse abilities to mix in with the rest all the time.

However, the abilities, and implementation thereof are fairly confusing - tutorials cover only the bare basics and expect the player to already know how to add and use 'higher' abilities. This screws up the progression of the early game.

1. Combat, This game have 3 stance low,middle and high which are evasive(dodge), defensive(block/parry) and offensive stance that you can and have to quickly switch between 3 stance that fit a situation. lot of active skill (even if most of them are meh and it's better to spam one or two attack ) to use and customize

2. Enemy, Most of them are unique and fun to fight, Except human boss that can block your attack with minimal ki(stamina) loss, very fast ki recovery that require you to play very aggressively and get one shot by a attack with fast start up animation hyper armor
This get worse in higher NG+ where they 1. have a passive HP regen 2. life drain on attack 3. even more total and Ki recovery speed 4. Faster

3. Story. It's alright but get bog down by bad story telling, nothing much to said about story

4. Graphic, this game on PC have a drawing distance problem which can be distracting but somewhat benefit on finding kodama because the prop that suppose to hide them didn't render if you are far enough . but otherwise this game look good

Rant time
1. Too much grinding in dream of the Wise and nioh and underworld depth. Because you need a proper builds with specialized gear, souls core and skill, you even need to grind to unlock higher NG+ cycle in the first place

2. Drop rate of smithing text(which become almost useless on DOTW and DOTN because you can't forge a ethereal rarity gear ) and boss skill drop rate are very low 
*note that you can temper lucky drop equipped armor/weapon. Equip a forged divine armor/weapon you want and hope for ethereal of equipped gear to drop )

I`ll start off with the combat. Plenty of builds to make and ways to approach different situations It still has that cool idea from Nioh 1 with its different stances.

Thankfully, the levels have good layouts and ways for you to get through them.

You can customize your character quite a bit. Not to mention that you can get the look from a lower piece of armor and put it on a higher grade armor. Meaning that you look good while you also have good stats.

The game has a nice blend of exploring and fighting and it knows when to spice it up or screw you up. It can feel random at times, but everything leads to a nice feeling of exploration.

This game is pretty solid , it has a lot of fun stuff in it, but what`s not so fun is that FPS. I can hit a constant 60, but in some areas it just goes to the ground.

Of course I understand that this game ""tries"" to be souls-like, but in contrast to games by From Software, I mostly feel tired even after short sessions with Nioh 2. And after defeating harder bosses, instead of feeling joy of accomplishment I rather feel sort of relief that I'm done with them and I can finally take a break from the game. 

The game looks good, the combat system is leagues ahead of Dark Souls, but like I said before, this game still feels like a slog. You can't relax even for a moment or you will be dead in a seconds. There are some tutorials but they barely scratch a surface of more in-depth mechanics.

What makes this game even worse is the system of side missions. All of them take place in just slightly modified locations from the main missions. All of them are boring and I really don't see the point of making already long game even longer.

Bosses also seem inconsistent. How many tries took me to defeat the first one? 4 or 5. The second one? Between 15 and 20. The third, fourth and fifth one? One try. Tbh, I don't feel like I'm getting better. They just seemed too easy. There were many more mini bosses that posed bigger threat than them. Because of that, the game progression suffers a lot. I really don't think that I'm getting any better or stronger. It just seems that enemies are pre-defined to be either weak or strong and no amount of character's levels will change that.

Also, due to this difficulty RPG elements suffer as well. If I don't wear anything, how much hits does it take for the bossed to kill me? One. If I wear top class heavy armors? Two or three. Like I said before, not feeling any sense of progression. Ok, maybe my character looks cooler in better armors but that's it.

Locations seem needlessly convoluted. Some of them are really terrible. Good example is Yoshitatsu's Castle. It consists of undeground, some sort of tower with multiple floors, outside area, outer castle gates and inside of the castle. Obviously, there is no map, most of the paths are blocked completely and there is a lot of minibosses around. After that level I decided to stop playing, because I noticed that there is literally no reason to continue. Levels are extremely boring, they can be describe in one word, like village, forest, castle or combinations of few like caves and camp. They are designed awfully and remind me more of The Surge (huge labirynths) than Dark Souls.

Inventory is extremely limited. You may think that 600 slots is a lot, but the game has sort of h'n's loot type, so you will probably fill it all in 5-6 missions. Then you will spend a lot of time selling/scraping or sacrificing it to free some space. There is also a storage, but you still need to browse through every single thing.

All things considered, I can't really recommend this game. It isn't THAT bad, it just seems more like a chore than an entertainment.

PS: I managed to clear Dark Souls III with DLCs in less than 40 hours. Here, after 30 hours, I have cleared 6 main missions from 19 or 20 (not even counting missions from DLC). Another terrible idea to make exhausting game (which begins to feel repetitive really quick) this long.",1633276700,1635875912,False,5,5,0.483497917652130127,0,True,False,False

If you are having trouble or just want somebody to co op with, add me I'm always down for co op on whatever difficulty or underworld or whatever.

Don't even really know where to begin with this one, besides saying that this game is amazing. Played it quite a bit, obviously and it just gets better. There is a staggering amount of content in this game, and a large portion of it doesn't unlock until you unlock Dream of the Nioh (NG+4) and it is a wild ride the whole time. Total blast, combat is amazing. Every weapon is fantastic! and by the end of the game you will be able to transform what the weapon scales with, so  you will be able to use any weapon you want potentially. 

So I guess I will start with possible cons. It is very difficult, not cheap but difficult. I don't consider this a con, but some people seem to. The sound cuts out annoyingly sometimes for a few seconds, but nothing too crazy. It is pretty well optimized now, but could be better. Another thing that might disappoint the Dark Souls fans is that its not a branching world from one zone to the other, its set up in levels on an overworld. Which was a bit of a bummer at first when I played the first Nioh, but it makes co op way more accessible.

Not many cons but I might think of some later. So Pros I guess now. Jeez, the combat for starters. Combos, upgrades, so many fantastic weapons in this game and they all level separately and have their own skill trees which is amazing, there are a few boring skills on the skill tree but they are huge enough to where it doesn't matter. Just in comparison to the first Nioh, the skill trees a HUGELY improved, in my humble opinion. So many reasons to play this game my goodness. So, enemy variety okay? Huge, its amazing. Yokai from Japanese mythology, its fascinating and their depiction in this game is incredible. So well designed. One of the big things that drew me to the first one, its even better here, more enemy variety. Bosses are awesome! different maps are awesome. Going back to how the  game is set up in levels instead of a giant branching world, a pro to this is that it makes co op a lot better cause you can choose specific missions, difficulties, if you want to play with a friend you can search either by friends on your friends list or by using a secret word. You can co op any mission in the entire game no matter where you are in the game, assuming you have beat the mission at least. But there is quick match co op or expedition. Expedition is more for a co op buddy and you both go through the game together, and you dont have to beat the mission first to be able to play it in expedition but you do need it unlocked of course. 

So here I will talk  about differences between this game and the original Nioh, at least that I remember. Dark realms. Okay, so Nioh 1 had Yokai realms, you know, the little circles that the Yokai put down that nerf your stamina regain. Dark realms are whole areas that are similar but not as punishing as standing in a yokai realm in the first game cause you at least still regain SOME stamina. New weapons, Fists, (my favorite my god) Splitstaff, Switch glave, hatchets, I think thats it thats new? If you didnt get the dlc for the  first game then you can add Odachi and tonfa to that list too.
Also, 2 of the new weapons scale with the magic stat, so if you are hardcore mage you have dedicated weapons which I found as being a HUGE improvement and in hindsight, a big missed opportunity in the first game but great that its here.

I just cant say enough good things about this game. Its great I love it. I might like it better then dark souls. I know its crazy. But its like Ninja Gaiden with improved combat even meets dark souls. Its so good. Another huge pro! The game comes standard on PC with all its dlc for $10 less then the normal full price of a game without dlc, its a GREAT deal for sure! Buy this game please! I will help you co op the whole game just add me! Anyway, take care and hope this info was helpful.

The combat system builds very much on the original, but has added and changed enough features to make it feel fresh and rewarding.
The core mechanics of stance based combat, and various weapon skills has remained unchanged, meaning that anyone who played the first one can jump into this one fairly easily. 
Don't assume this makes this one easy though. A brand new ""Burst"" mechanic has been added to the game giving every enemy special attacks, dealing significant damage, if not countered using the new Burst counter mechanic. 
Additionally, a new resource of Amina was introduced, which is similar to the Ki used for standard attacks.
Anima is used to carry out burst counters and the new Yokai abilities. Unlike Ki, Amina is build up via attacking the enemies and only depletes when using associated skills.

All skill trees have had a fairly substantial overhaul, and have become a lot more manageable. Using weapons/ninjutsu/omnyo will now gain proficiency levels for that particular skill only and allows you to unlock skills for relevant trees quickly. All trees enjoy more skills/passives to choose from. A new Samurai tree now allows the unlocking of skill modifiers, such as stat based damage boosts or imbuing elemental effects.
The living weapon mode has been replaced in favour of a new shiftling mode, allowing the player to temporarily transform into a Yokai. This comes with its own skill tree and unique abilities.

Overall Nioh 2 is a welcomed addition to the franchise, telling an interesting story preceding William's Adventure's of Nioh 1, acting as a form of prequel. 
A number of characters and enemies make a return, though a plethora of new ones also make their introductions. The new weapons allow for even greater variety of combat, with some allowing for near infinite combos if carried out correctly.
If you are a fan of Nioh 1, or enjoy challenging games, give Nioh 2 a try. It is rewarding when you manage to beat the various levels and provides a high replay value through its various NG+ cycles.",1635668886,1635668886,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The amount of work and care put into this game is so evident in the gameplay that you cant call it a souls clone because it is so far beyond copying a formula. Team Ninja didn't even copy Nioh 1's formula, I'm not getting bored of playing the same game I just beat because Nioh 2 is different. They reworked quite a few systems and introduced some new ones and it makes for the most enjoyable, challenging, fair, balanced and variety filled combat I have ever experienced.

There is no META in this game, you get a huge variety of options and you chose what you like and it will be VIABLE. You dont have to be afraid you're playing wrong because if you can always beat a boss if you hone your skills with what you have. You dont need to grind, but you can and its an enjoyable experience. You dont need to use every tactic, because getting really good at the core few is all you need; then you can branch out and build what you use to your sense of style. Few games give you this much freedom while still being captivating.

You might wonder if you should play Nioh 1 first, and you can. The graphics hold up and the gameplay is just as good. But tbh it doesn't matter, these are two different games and you should play both, but if you want to play the more modern, developed and fully realized version; play this first, i havent even noticed any spoilers in this game for Nioh 1.

TLDR: If you want a challenging, fair and in depth game with amazing combat; look no further.

-some builds are insane because of multi buff combined with special armor like the tosho governor, at the cost of only setting one move or skill it gains a massive damage boost.
-great enemies designee but some can be annoying like that god ugly bull bug boss, just slow, hits hard, and makes you take things slow.
-i feel in love with the ki system because if it was used in dark souls spammers could be easily clapped for not paying attention, a.k.a. if you get hit with low ki you are put in a stance that can cause double or more damage, and or cause the opponent to grapple you.
the only negative thing i could really say against the game is with the heavy handed nature of the late game content like the abyss and higher new game pluses, i'm not really aware of a decent damage multi attack build, by that i mean when you see all the super kill builds they almost always use only one ability or attack, i'd like it if the idea of those builds could make something that takes that raw damage and even's it out across all attacks you do, i'd rather not make progress in the game if all i get to do is one specific attack or i'm shit out of luck, that just makes it boring for me but don't worry i don't mind people who do love their one shots it's just a preference for me.

Nioh 2 is a game you can spend a ton of time on. The whole package can last you many many hours with challenging main and side missions, new game+ adds, and a whole bevy of play styles to try out. If you're looking for a challenging game that can last you a ton of hours, Nioh 2 might be something you're looking for. 

My current play time is me doing most, if not all, the side missions up to my current point in the story. I think I'm near the end.

--- Content Review ---
Nioh 2 is a tough-ass game that is wholeheartedly taking pages from stuff like the Souls series, a touch of Diablo, and Ninja Gaiden, the last of which the team behind Nioh created. What I find spectacular is that it manages to scratch those gameplay itches in different ways while building off of the first Nioh to create something of its own. It's fast, deadly, and flashy. 

The yokai abilities are a great addition to the game, creating another piece of the combat that I enjoyed. When you find your window to do a yokai counter, you get to have some fun.  The individual yokai active abilities can be fun additions to your kit, whether for applying effects, giving you a strong option for different engagement ranges, or having a powerful move up your sleeve for when it's time to go for the kill.

There is a ton of customizing of your character and play style. There's plenty of weapon types to try, special moves for each weapon, three different yokai forms, a cadre of guardian spirits to pick, more gear than you could ever properly parse through, a wide selection of yokai abilities to equip, modifiers for special attacks, the list goes on. If you have fun just stacking up abilities, making your numbers huge, and having a ridiculous amount of options this game has that level of depth that you can choose to engage in.

The game looks largely the same as the first Nioh, but they've sharpened some stuff up, added some crazy looking new enemies and dialed up the supernatural flair. The aesthetics of the game are unified and work well. Graphically speaking, saying ""its looks good"" doesn't feel useful to write, but I like how the game looks. The game has run pretty well on my rig and I've run into very very minimal issues technically speaking.

Story-wise it generally feels a little more understandable than the first Nioh but it's still largely rooted in knowing stuff about the Sengoku period and that whole conflict, which I don't so I can feel some of it flying over my head sometimes. At the core of it is your character meeting some weirdos like you and growing your notoriety as warriors, dealing with a supernatural threat while fighting on the front lines of a war across Japan. It works well enough. It's serviceable with some neat things here and there. 

Overall, I'm into this game for its blistering fast and tough gameplay and I wholeheartedly recommend it on those merits. It's a fun game if you like to sweat a little for it. The character creator is cool, which honestly is more of a high point than I initially thought it would be.

If I had to point out some things I didn't like...
‚Ä¢ I feel like the amount of character equipment and skill options is so overwhelming sometimes for me personally. I did end up finding a hook or two to build my character off of with a weapon I enjoyed. I'm not fully doing the whole weapon swapping thing, I just mostly stick to my tonfas and they're fun.
‚Ä¢ There's a couple of levels from the first Nioh game that they love to reuse. It's only in side missions this kind of stuff shows up in but man that mountain temple with the underground crypt is one they LOVE.
‚Ä¢ Game is hard, it sometimes just really doesn't feel like you're getting stronger but more that you're keeping up with the crazy damage that enemies deal. It's a ""git gud"" type of thing but I feel like it's worth mentioning that sometimes it can be super punishing.

I got the first Nioh on Epic Game Store for free recently and if it weren't for that, I likely wouldn't have ever played this game. As a huge Dark Souls/From Software fan, this game is basically Dark Souls mixed with Ninja Gaiden and Shadow of Mordor. It has way more depth and many more gameplay mechanics than any Dark Souls game.

-Atmostsphere/Story: The atmosphere, in general, is not as good as From Software games (still very good), but the story is actually coherent comparatively and it doesn't require you to do mental gymnastics in order to understand it. Nioh 1's story is practically non-existent, but Nioh 2's is much better and actually enjoyable for what it is.

-Gameplay: The gameplay is what this game does best. It is probably one of, if not, the best combat system I have ever used in a game like this. It's difficult, but rewarding and has so much depth and replayability that it is kinda crazy. Splitstaff is amazing

-Graphics: The game doesn't look amazing compared to other recent titles, but it still looks good and runs at over 100 fps for me. I like the art design. Lots of particle effects on screen at once can tank your FPS and make your game go into slow mo though which can be annoying.

-Sound: Nothing special or anything that I remember specifically. It's just your average game's sound. I do have issues with hearing static near certain objects/areas and I'm positive it's from the game. That is the only notable issue I have with it.

-Overall: Buy this game. It can take time to learn all the mechanics and get good at the game, but it is a very rewarding experience if you choose to stick with it.

Many additions and improvements. More story and involvement of the player character.

Custom characters with a great editor and code sharing.

3 player coop. More NPC allies. Optional CPU allies of other players. Place your ""summon"" where you want.

Smithing is simpler, uses mainly umbracite. Underworld (Abyss) is streamlined and has progression upgrades.

Many new enemies, new bosses. Returning enemies with new moves.

Way more skills, including monster abilities, most enemies drop a unique skill for you to equip and use.

More weapon, ninja and onmyo skills! Progression advanced through usage and dealing damage.

New weapons! Dual HATCHETS you can throw, close quarters KNUCKLES and big SCYTHES for edgelords. 

""Demon Parade"" an arena mode with coop, introduces a new equipment slot and helps loot farming.

I hate it so much. Its dark souls in the worst way, its all the worst parts of dark souls 2 and all its unfair and cheap difficulty.
Before this just becomes a rant let me just say some positives: The game has incredible complexity like the kind you could get lost in for hours, every weapon has three stances to them and an entire skill tree. However that skill tree all seems to be blocked till you pass one mission which I didn't get to so the more fun parts of the skill tree were locked away. The melee combat is fun and very fluid and I especially love the punching gloves weapon. It has a really good character creator and that's it for the positives.
Firstly the story: I couldn't follow any of it. Maybe you need to play the first game but it was just a mess of terms I did not understand and proper nouns that just went over my head. I gave up trying to follow it almost immediately. Second is that the game starts in default Japanese audio. Sekiro did this too and it pisses me off because I'm dyslexic! Subtitles just do not work for me unless I'm pausing the thing constantly in order to make sure I read it right before continuing.
The passing is also really bad. The various sub-missions are all re-used from the main missions with a different starting point and some paths blocked off. Un-creative at best and lazy at worst and I don't even get the point for doing them beyond the extra loot and XP. Speaking off!
This game is so complex and has no idea how to properly convey that to the play beyond text walling them to death. Now, as said before, I'm dyslexic so just slapping me with walls and walls of text is beyond annoying but even then no one likes learning stuff like this. Front loading your game with information is a way to turn people off quickly. And the thing is you can have both. You can have a complex game with a good tutorial, its not impossible. But Nioh doesn't even try. It just throws you into the first level and says to skip the first enemy you see because its harder then the boss of that area. Which feels both lazy and a slap to new player who maybe aren't familiar with souls born type experiences.
Going off about that let me complain about the stupid little things the game does that annoys me. Why the ever loving FUCK! did you decide to call it ki instead of stamina? I was leveling up my stamina star for 5 hours wondering why I wasn't seeing any change only to realize it wasn't the right thing. Yeah that was probably explained at some point but since any menu at all brings out so much text and stats that you won't find what you're looking for on the first look. Also an important thing that you will need to know is a ki pulse to stop these things that stop your not stamina from recharging. Which I didn't, because it was in one of the many text pop ups in the first level that I was ignoring because who the fuck thought that was a good idea? Speaking of that! There is a whole thing about countering red flash attacks that I also missed because it was in another text pop up in the middle of the first boss fight! God damn it!
But one the biggest thing in this fucking game is that the level layouts are just beyond shit. Like I said at the beginning it is dark souls 2's worst qualities. Hidden traps, enemy placement that just feels unfair a lot of the time and long treks between checkpoints. Some of the early levels had locked doors or ladders that were pulled up that you could use for shortcuts but in the soaring region it felt like it had none. Which was compounded by the fact the levels were very confusing and I often got lost. But I can forgive the occasional ""Oh look an item in the open, better grab it. Oops! Looks like we hid an enemy where they can jump down and grab you!"" but I swear it was every fucking item by the Soaring region. There's a part before fighting a strong mini-boss enemy with a stronger then normal enemy close by and they hid a little fucking enemy up top that jumps down on you if you forget to take them out before getting close. Which you are bound to forget doing the segment over. All of this wouldn't be AS bad if it wasn't for the worst part of the fucking game:
Healing items are a limited consumable. You can just up and run out of them. And in a game this trial and error that is a death sentence. The only way I found to reliably get more healing items is to make an offering of all the equipment you're not using at the shrine and hope that it blesses you with healing items. There is probably a better way but as stated before the text wall tutorials did not help me learn anything!

I hate this game. I hate it so much. It just pushed all the wrong difficulty buttons and was such an unforgiving frustrating experience that I do not recommend anyone to play.",1633568692,1633568692,False,5,2,0.48398900032043457,0,True,False,False

That being said, I think the game has enough elements that differentiates it and puts it on an entirely new level to Dark Souls.
[b]PROS[/b]: 
[list]
[*]Nioh 2 feels like a title that encourages co-op, so it's fun to play with your significant other or with a couple of buddies, if a multiplayer experience is what you're looking for. There are thankfully no PvP modes, so you don't have to worry about that (and if you wanted one, too bad, I guess).
[*]The customization in this game is amazing and you are allowed to modify the appearance of your character whenever you want, as long as you have access to your hut. As well, you can refashion weapons and armor. So if there's anything you're not a fan of visually but you really like the stats of, you can always change its appearance with another piece of armor that you own.
[*]A lot of weapons to choose from and a lot of abilities to adapt your playstyle to be whatever you want it to be. You can walk the path of the ninja or become an onmyoji. Or both. After you've done enough grinding, of course.
[*]Tutorials that you can revisit. The combat is difficult at first, but you can get the hang of it with enough practice. Personally, it took me a while to get used to the yokai shifting (transformation) mechanic and its respective combos, specifically countering and grappling at the perfect moment.
[/list]
[b]CONS[/b]: 
[list]
[*]The camera tracking/adjusting can be annoying during some battles (e.g. Kamaitachi) where the enemy blitzes from one side to the other or straight up flies out of your range.
[*]The combined combat elements might be too much to take in at once.

Combat is more fun and varied overall (Devil trigger >>> shiny sword), and this applies to levels and bosses as well which are generally quite a bit better than previously. This applies to the story also, they actually managed to make that more compelling through a more personal connection with the main cast. This is quite ironic, considering the 1st game had a named character who spoke while this time around you make your own little silent samurai. The last few missions offer something that I don't think Nioh 1 ever fully achieved, battles where both gameplay and narrative come together to form a really satisfying whole (especially the final boss, which is a highlight for this series). 

It also feels like the game has more than 3 music tracks now, unlike in the last game. I was actually a bit surprised by the soundtrack being so solid overall, because the music in the 1st really wasn't that memorable to me. There are a few standouts here that really elevate the scenes in which they're used. 

On a somewhat similar note, the 1st game felt really front-loaded, and started to get stale during the 2nd half, while in this game I'd argue that the opposite might be the case. There are still some low points, but I felt that the more varied levels kept things fresh enough. Nioh 2 is also pretty massive regarding content. An argument can be made that there might even be too much content, because a good chunk of it feels REALLY samey, but that's up for debate. I'm personally still not a big fan of the loot system, but I'll doubt that changes any time soon. At least the new weapons are fun, but I can see the loot an inventory management push some people away from this game. 

If you enjoy Soulslike-games, you should definitely give this a go. However,  If you played the first Nioh and didn't enjoy it, I have a hard time seeing this game change your mind.

Although Nioh 2 is a Soulslike at its core, rehashing many mechanics familiar to players of the genre, Nioh 2 innovates and manages successfully to breathe new life into the field. 

Set in feudal Japan, Nioh 2 starts the protagonist off as a warrior-for-hire, banking on their half-human-half-yokai skills to make a living on the edge of society. A coincidental meeting with an unassuming client throws the protagonist head-first into the war effort, and sets the stage for an unlikely tale of an mercenary-turned-samurai, fighting for the future of Japan, and of the human and yokai that live within it.

Nioh 2's story and stages are set within the caricature of the struggle to unify Japan, battles and all. This backdrop gave the development team the opportunity to design a variety of stages, from midday fortress sieges to late-night village infiltrations, all part of the overarching tale. Many real historical figures and battles are re-enacted, but there is a distinct mystical twist, with the incorporation of many yokai of folklore into the setting, lending the story a flourish all its own.

The gameplay very much resembles a Soulslike. For the uninitiated, Soulslikes are games borne out of the success of the Dark Souls series of games developed by From Software. Infamous for their steep learning curve and punishing gameplay, Soulslikes expect you to die, and to die a lot. But Soulslikes also expect you to learn from mistakes and overcome the challenges that they present to you. After all, Soulslikes trade in the rush from overcoming adversity, and overcome you shall, if you put in the effort. That doesn't mean that the
game is unfair, or excessively hard; far from it. Nioh 2 sets the expectation that you're willing to learn from defeat and experiment. When you get how the game is meant to be played, everything clicks, and the game becomes a challenge that you can grapple with and work to solve. The hard part is getting past the initial
steep curve.

Nioh 2, while sticking to the core of what makes a game a Soulslike, adds its own set of twists to the format. Ki pulses that can be performed after attacks at the right times to regain stamina add a defined rhythm and deepen swordplay. Would you Ki pulse at the right time to regain the maximum amount of stamina in order to maintain tip-top condition for the assault to come, or Ki pulse early in anticipation of an upcoming quick jab? The interplay between safety and greed is a welcome addition that adds depth to the stamina-based gameplay of a Soulslike. Furthermore, as a half-yokai, you get the ability to use the abilities of the yokai you befriend, ranging from simple dodges and parries to the signature ability of yokais, and even full-body transformations and assorted techniques. The yokai abilities flip the traditional dynamic of a Soulslike game, offering powerful abilities (tied to a resource meter of its own) that you can use to beat down enemies in an all-new yokai fashion.

In conclusion, Nioh 2 is a familiar-yet-unique package that is definitely worth getting into, if you're already a fan of the Soulslike genre, or if you like Japanese history and folklore.",1630745904,1633008243,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nioh 2 is a souls-like game (but not actually souls) 3rd person action game taking place in Feudal Japan (Sengoku Period, 1550-1620) where players are basically assured death for bad decisions, bad mistakes, bad techniques, and... well, bad luck*.

Game Play:
The best part of this game is character customization. No, seriously, it's the best I have ever seen from a console based game and r/glamurai has enough threads to prove it.


There is a variety of weapons to choose from ranging from the iconic katana to the exotic ninja kusarigama, each with 3 stances (High, Mid Low) with the weapon's innate strength and weaknesses.

On top of the complicated weapons and combat styles, there are also 3 types of armor (Light, Medium, and Heavy) with possibly their own hidden stats* and vaguely defined letter grades (from C to AAA)**.

[i]*SUPPOSEDLY, according to an old thread on reddit, Full light armor offers 8% damage reduction, full medium offers 15%, and full heavy offers a whopping 25% BEFORE the raw defense is used to calculate damage taken by the player.[/i]

[i]*Levels play a huge hidden role in my own experience. If you are getting wrecked in normal mode on certain missions, go back to it later when you are at least 20 levels over the recommended level - you will notice you stagger a lot less and the enemies are more easily staggered (first fight against Honda Tadakatsu and Yasuke the obsidian samurai).[/i]

[i]**Nioh 2 does not clearly specify what stats stacks nor how damage is calculated... So you end up with a good number of autistic players and tryhards trying to ""proof"" something (thankfully, because I can't do that and I cherry pick what fits how I play from their guides).[/i]

Armor weight is a thing in this game, and it is best to keep armor weight no worse than ""B"" agility (< 70%) otherwise dodging and running will be painfully difficult for the player.

Unlike souls game, blocking (and deciding when to block) is a valid defense technique, however, this is further made complicated by a stat called ""Toughness"" (again, ranging from letters AA to F, anything worse than ""B"" means blocking an attack will take away far more stamina).

Suffice to say, the combat stats calculation is opaque and deep enough to keep people guessing and experiment a variety of character builds*.

[i]*This game allows you to respec your character after advancing enough, so don't worry about creating new characters.[/i]

First I open the game and find the settings menu is all in Japanese (even thought the main menu is in English. I managed after some googling to find out which was the correct option to change this, but not a great start (4th option starting from bottom on mine, in case you have the same issue).

Then on to the main problem so far. The controls are an abomination. 'Interact' is mapped to 'B' on XBOX controller, and dodge is on 'A' - the exact opposite to what you would expect for a western release. This would be fine, but despite the fact you can customise most other controls, this one is greyed out and you aren't allowed to change it for... no reason at all? It's bonkers.

I manged to use a program called ReWasd to create a virtual controller which rebinds buttons to something sane, and it just about works, apart from in certain text based menus during play. So I still have to swap to mouse to click anything in a text menu. I can't figure out if this is because the game actually mixes up which button is for which sometimes or what, but it's a total mess.

And in the 45 minutes it took to get this working it had already crashed once. 

I haven't even got far enough yet to see if I'll have the same graphical and other crashing issues others here have had.

I'm going to stick with it for now, having put so much effort into making the controls work, but I ought to refund it. if you're in any doubt I strongly recommend you wait until these issues are patched or it's on a steep sale. 

The game might well be fantastic, but from a technical point of view this steam release is absolute garbage so far.

UPDATE: I've managed to get the controls working in a way that lets me play this without fighting a decade of muscle memory. I used a third party program to set up one virtual controller profile that has normal controller input, a second profile that swaps A and B, and a keyboard button to swap between them. I use the normal profile for interacting with menus, and then the 'swapped' profile for playing the game. It sounds complicated but is actually very simple to use and makes it playable for me.",1632340439,1632430901,False,3,2,0.434575140476226807,0,True,False,False

This really isn't Nioh Two because a significant amount of the game is just Nioh One being resold. Players can create their own monotonously silent protagonist with a relatively decent character creator, but that protagonist is basically a reskin of the one from the previous game. All their basic animations seem to be the same, all the weapons from the previous game reappear with the exact same combat animations and relatively identical skill trees. There's a couple new weapons at least, but Magic and Ninjustu are also largely the same too. Several bosses and areas from the first game are reused, many if not most of the regular enemies are recycled as well. 

They even ripped bosses from the first game into the DLC for this one. When that DLC was released it was sold for ten dollars, and maybe half the bosses in each ten dollar DLC in Nioh Two are literally just bosses from Nioh One being reused.

The combat is mostly the same as it was before. Mainly since this looks to be the exact same code. It's a solid combat system with emphasis on punishing players for being too reckless, rewarding stamina management and strategically targeting enemy weaknesses. Until players reach the point where they've figured out how to juggle most enemies with the same effortless attack sequence over and over; at which point this turns into a thoughtless button masher. Then after awhile the game introduces new enemies which seemingly can't be juggled and the combat becomes divided between enemies that players actually have to fight; and enemies players can just button mash.

Although a fair amount of the bosses aren't very interesting they do manage to present a distinct threat. But the greatest threat to players is generally just grapple attacks. The game desperately depends on grapple attacks to defeat the player or at least rip off large chunks of their health. Literally every enemy has a grapple attack just about, some have multiple. Most enemy grapples will lock onto the player exactly, requiring players to dodge at the absolute last second to avoid losing two thirds or all of their health to said grapple. Almost every enemy has a grapple, players cannot avoid the grapple without dodging at the exact right moment and each grapple has a completely different timing that must be learned. 

So players are relentlessly punished throughout the entire course of this game by losing large chunks or all of their health to grapples that require several instances of getting grappled to learn the timing to maybe avoid it. Players must go through this process with almost every enemy and boss, some of which are only a threat because of their grapple. Especially when they can lunge across a room, run in circles around the player until they finally get the grab, or can seamlessly integrate the grapple into their attack combinations.

The story in this game is an incoherent mess of disjointed cutscenes, bland characters, conflicts that beg no investment from the player, story events that make no sense, pointless backstory dumps and the introduction of new story entities with absolutely no explanation at all. The story is based around a fictitious distortion of human history because the writers were too uncreative to come up with their own story. Pathetic and grotesque to use actual human wars that resulted in countless instances of death and suffering as the plot for your wretched piece of entertainment you call a video game. 

Yet worse still is the propagandic way the story depicts certain human groups in those wars as being the reprehensible antagonists who were corrupted by demon crystals, while other human groups are presented as the protagonists trying to stop this fictitious corruption. The writing practically trips over itself trying to glorify certain humans in particular and the protagonist spends a significant portion of the story basically being the personal tool for a murderous dictator.

Consequently the entire game is bent around trying to stay within the confines of its pseudo human history basis. Players relentlessly travel through similar looking villages, woods and battlefields fighting the same generic human and demon enemies for no particularly coherent reason. It's only in the DLC where the game locations actually start to become somewhat interesting and unique, right around the time where they introduce [spoiler]time travel[/spoiler] to the plot and now it's actually just about impossible to tell what the story is about anymore.

Much of the player's time is otherwise spent picking up useless items, the game is cluttered with numerous consumables that players will likely never use and perpetual loot drops that need to be dealt with. Between Magic, Ninjutsu and generic items the game probably has over sixty types of consumables yet players only have eight default quick slots. Several of which will already be used up for vital items like the basic healing consumable. There are a ridiculous amount of micro statistics attached to every piece of gear too; making later game optimization tedious while various important elements of those statistics aren't even properly explained to the player at all.

Even the multiplayer is an atrocious mess on its own. The game hasn't been balanced around it at all. There's so many particle effects and moving shapes at a given time that combat becomes incoherent button spamming, which is reinforced by how easily players can stunlock and mash down enemies together. Enemy models randomly desync causing them to teleport around, status effects desync and don't show the proper amount left which makes keeping track of status application on enemies basically impossible. Half the time the game won't even let players enter a lobby and sometimes the game will become hardlocked post mission.


Boring locations, intensely recycled content, atrocious story, overbearing loot system, terrible multiplayer implementation and much of the difficulty actually just stems from all the grapple attacks. Otherwise the combat is decent if players want absolutely nothing else from the game besides a decent combat system; although it is mostly recycled from the previous one.

Anyways I am two hours in at the time of writing this so there's no getting that $50.00 back now... 
So here are the important things I know [so far]:

*Great character creation. Yes. You can make those milk missiles as big and as anime as you want.
*Combat is more action oriented then Dark Souls. You use stamina for your actions but everything replenishes fast. Attacks are also fast. You WONT be asking yourself ""Is now a good time to swing?"" too much.
*The world is not open. You pick a place on the map and start your mission.

I will edit this as time goes by lord willing. And also as I check out the co-op.

UPDATE:

Alright. I'm currently 16 hours in and well...... The game is pretty badass! Again, as a Dark Souls main with +1000 hours in just DS3 alone; this review is mainly for fellow undead.

So, if you like the genre go ahead and buy it. You may be cringing for the first few hours but once you get into things trust me, You'll be ok until Elden Ring.

FEATURES:

‚Ä¢ You enter levels by selecting them on the overworld map. But these levels are NOT small, and are NOT empty by any means. You will enjoy your time exploring and fighting and looting. Which more than makes up for the lack of ""true"" open-world gameplay.

‚Ä¢ There are plenty of skill trees to customize your play-style. An example would be unlocking a guard breaking kick after a quick attack, OR unlocking a back-step slash after your quick attack. Leap over your foes with your spear, OR stab them in the gut and re-position them. And yes, there are plenty of ways to parry.

‚Ä¢ Co-op is fine. You go to the shrine (bonfire) and use sake cups to open your current mission to any players who might be standing by. There are NO invasions. If you die, then it will be a CPU killing you. This, in my opinion, is the ONLY thing missing from this experience.

‚Ä¢ Appearance, Skills, Weapons, and Powers can all be reallocated with ease. So no multiple saves and characters required.

All in all: It's a good, well worked on game. Play it and try for yourself.",1632162465,1632260274,True,116,7,0.84381788969039917,0,True,False,False

Fun cinematics, good build variety, and tough-as-nails enemies and bosses. It's got some pretty rough edges that make it hard to enjoy at first, but then you figure out the combat, and it starts to be a lot of fun. Combat is combo-heavy, which is hard to get used to if you're coming from a Souls game, but it's fun once you figure it out.

I Didn't love the episodic feel, or the enemy density in some instances. If you're playing with friends, you can't sneeze without stumbling into another freaking yokai, so there are some balancing issues. Also don't really love the equipment system, since it runs on sort of a gacha-type deal where random item drops have rarity and randomized stats?

The game has amazing character creator, gameplay with the skills is extremely varied and im still learning loads of new combos and abilities 400+ hours into the game. Bossfights can be frustrating, especially the human variants but they still have a good balance of difficulty and fun. (except you Saito, f*ck off)

The game is extremely deep when it comes to items and skill customisation. With a huge range of different stats on equipment while every single weapon type has its own skill tree which lets you customise which combos you want to use.

The game comes with 5 difficulties, each one unlocking some more game mechanics or potential drops, or just harder enemies, which i will admit was a bit tedious to play through the same campaign 5 times.

The story is definitly its weakest point, With constant timeskips while barely anything is being explained but the bare minimum.
But overall the game is super solid, def recommend.

It has one of the best melee combat systems of any game period. The weapons vary in difficulty and skill cap so there is a little something for everyone. The magic and ninjutsu can stand on its own or complement any build. 

It is a direct imrpovement over nioh 1, with excellent character customization that lets you make a beautiful PC or a hilarious abomination. 

Additionally, this is one of the best optimized games released in the last few years. I have a fairly old PC that struggles to run things like RDR2 or Fallout 4, but I have had no issues running this game and have been surprised at how fast its loads and exits. 

The ONE complaint I have is that I wish there was over-world exploration like Dark Souls. The levels are complex and amazing to explore, secret paths and hidden shortcuts are abundant. But you have to enter from a level selector which is ~fine~ but I wish it could be something more. Basically a non-issue. 

You should definitely play this game, insta-buy if it goes on sale.

Beneath some great gameplay mechanics is a slew of issues. Terrible game-balance, a very lacking storyline, dull and uninspired levels, ugly armor and weapon pieces, countless glitches and bugs, flickering on menus that make the game unplayable, frame drops out of nowhere that tank it from a smooth 60 to unplayable 20, pathing issues, idiotic AI issues, inconsistent and poorly designed menus, auto lock issues that sometimes prevent you from locking onto distant enemies or moving enemies and sometimes auto locks to the wrong one, horrendous camera especially when backed into a wall, unbalanced boss designs that swing gameplay from laughably easy to frustratingly difficult, slippery movement, incomplete keyboard prompts, inconsistent and quirky menu and setting navigations, inconsistent grappling/final blow prompts which don't register, tracking issues from the enemies that make their move timing arbitrary and inconsistent, inconsistent enemy detection, invisible walls that block ranged attacks, incessant farming and veiled ""variety"", the list goes on and on.

Noticing a trend here in criticism? The name is [b]INCONSISTENCY[/b]. With this kind of combat, especially at NG+ cycles, you should not be dealing with game breaking issues that make deaths unfair and unbalanced. Imagine reducing someone to zero ki and they just keep on swinging as if they're at full energy, laughable. At the core is a good game in concept, but the execution is just utterly sloppy and awful. The developers have no idea how to create a balanced and sensible game.

When the NG+ cycles increase in difficulty, the gameplay just becomes a loop of ""farm rare items"", ""break enemy ki"", and ""don't get hit or you'll die in 1 or 2 hits"". It's not satisfying or interesting, it's dull and frustrating. Artificial difficulty that doesn't challenge the player but instead find ways to cheese the mechanics and exploit the game.

If Team Ninja thinks this is a well done completed project, then they should be ashamed. People say this game is ""underrated"". It's not underrated, it has far too many issues to deserve the praise that others keep giving it. Unless you want an incomplete and buggy mess,

Combat is as smooth as it was in the first game but with an even faster pace at times thanks to the addiction of the burst counter and yokai abilities mechanics. 

Weapons wise everything is good aside from the switchglaive being absolutely overtuned with nearly no downside aside from Ki consumption (and even that can be solved easily)

In term of difficulty, Nioh 2 is pretty much on the same level as the first. Most bosses are strong but not too unforgiving. As for the difficulty spikes, they are pretty predictable but not too big (aside from the first mission of DLC3). Some bosses and enemies return from Nioh 1 with a twist but all the new ones are super cool. The game clearly rewards you for memorizing patterns and timing so by the time you start NG+, only bosses and mini-bosses should be a challenge.

On the matter of armor and accessories, I'm really glad that most of the new sets are somewhat usable and actually good but the number of returning sets is pretty disappointing considering that one of the coolest sets for a ninja/tonfa build is missing (the leader of the ten braves set).

The sound design is exquisite as always and the soundtrack is superb.

The changes made to the abyss system are so and so to me but not a problem in the end.

with a caveat. 
The highly complex sophisticated combat system is both the game's greatest strength and greatest weakness. If you absolutely despise the fighting mechanics found in the Ninja Gaiden series then this game is not for you. While it is possible to exploit enemy patterns to a limited extent, the AI is far more aggressive as well as adaptive; so unlike other Souls-like games,  ""cheesing"" a battle here will always end in failure. You have to learn and use all available options in order to be successful, especially in later areas where mistakes are brutally (and often fatally) punished.
With that out of the way, let's dive in.
While Code Vein and the Surge series come very close with their enjoyable gameplay mechanics, Nioh 2 simply adds so much refinement as well as polish that it is a superior game even to Nioh 1.
The fighting system is vastly improved with additional mechanics such as the Yokai Shift, new weapons to experiment with and a greatly expanded ability system.
The immensely-expanded character skill tree means no two characters will be the same. Do you want to be a specialist or be versatile in several disciplines? The choice is yours and that's certainly a positive improvement.
You are now finally able to customize accessory items (highly requested from fans) along with the sheer amount of customization options (weapons, armor, equipment) is mind-boggling.
That ""carrot-on-the-stick"" cycle is alive and well. Players will be spending many enjoyable hours finding equipment with just that ""right"" trait to suit your ensemble.
Do you need to play Nioh 1 to enjoy Nioh 2? 
Not really. 
You'll actually be spoilt by the new gameplay mechanics as well as the polished refinement compared to Nioh 1.

I am a keyboard and mouse user so a lot of my difficulties are actually vested in the fact that I have to play the game without PROPER PROMPTS which makes this a memory game that eventually goes to muscle. It is by far my biggest complaint, it's simply dumb founded how you can release a game for PC with full keyboard and mouse support yet not have a simple as can be (think bad words) prompt swap. Honestly developers these days are smooth brained when it comes to such concideration for fan bases. I do not need to buy a controller when the game is completely able to run off my keyboard and mouse by default and I refuse.

Outside of the simply minded keyboard and mouse prompt issue, the game is fun it's definitely an upgrade from Nioh 1 and is actually challenging when you aren't confused on what buttons do what. I enjoy the graphical updates without taking away from the original style. I was surprised to see the game looks much better than the OG Nioh, not by huge amounts but it's definitely overall better looking.

Performance is a bit lacking in some areas and particularly when you start getting a lot of effects coming into play (multiplayer especially). I have a 3900X and a RTX 2080 running my OS and game off a 2tb NVME drive. The game loads fast (Which I heard it did even on last GEN PS4), this is great because I don't have to wait too long to get back into the game.

The character creator is great and puts to shame many modern games (main stream I mean) that offer ""player avatar"" customization. Only RDR2 Online and similiar games offer reasonably comparable avatar customization. You also aren't stuck with your character design. I wish they had save-able presets for the customization for your character but they do offer ""codes"" to get your character how you like them (although I could be wrong on the details).

Game has been since updated. I love this game. One of my top 10 overall. Performance on PC has improved significantly but crashes happen more often on some levels (particularly the Rice Fields Level).",1612743874,1630200371,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a MUST buy for all the fans of difficult/ souls games/ hack&slash games, Nioh 1 was great, NIoh 2 is AMAZING, it may seem and start hard at the beginning, but boy it goes really well after a while, probably after 3rd region when you get some things understood, and things become more clear, more options to create your skill tree and such, and the cherry on top is the character creation.

Gameplay: an easy 8.5 / 10.
Music: Nioh / 10.
difficulty: Nioh.
graphics: 8/10.

some things i found a bit not so creative and if they just delayed 1 year of development they could probably not fall into these minor problems, some bosses seem to be brought straight from nioh 1, and put into nioh 2, last boss in first DLC map is basically Umi bozu from NIoh 1, almost same attack animation mashed with the new mechanic of Nioh 2.

some maps are the exact same as in nioh 1, but good thing they are side missions only, not main missions.

overall, i can easily give this game 9/10. and recommend it to everyone who likes this type of game!",1630055983,1630055983,True,16,0,0.600455224514007568,0,True,False,False

Nioh 2 is an action RPG looter with a stamina-based melee-focused combat system set in a historical fantasy setting.

[h2]Frequently Asked Questions or Concerns[/h2]
[list][*]You can co-op with two other players through nearly every mission, though some scenes you may have to play/watch solo, then rejoin your friends after. 
[*]Nioh 2 story-wise is about 95% prequel to Nioh 1, and 5% sequel, so you can play this without Nioh 1. Though story is not this game's strong point.
[*]In my opinion, the control scheme may have a short learning curve with a gamepad. You can play with keyboard and mouse, but you'll probably need to change the controls to your liking instead of using the defaults. 
[*]The game difficulty is punishing. Co-op can DRAMATICALLY make the game easier. (i.e. clearing a mission or boss on the 1st or 2nd try instead of 10~20 tries)
[*]No official PvP and does not appear to be plans to add at the time of this review
[*]Backup your save and/or if your save doesn't load, try to rename your BACKUP.BIN to SAVEDATA.bin in the Documents \ KoeiTecmo \ Nioh2 \ SaveData \ xx \ SaveData00 folder (or the location of your save file)
[*]Turning off DLSS may resolve some crashing and graphic issues at the time of this review
[/list]

[h1]Longer:[/h1]
[h2]What I Liked[/h2]
[list][*] Character creation's facial options being complex enough to make Hiroyuki Sanada, Emilia Clarke, that Geralt fella from that there Witcher game, and even Kanye West
[*] Historical feudal fantasy setting in Japan and unlocking lore for various characters and monsters
[*] Beautiful and fitting atmospheric music - with the second boss track making you bust into that old Xmen cartoon title theme
[*] A very deep stamina-based rhythmic combat system filled with counters, re-positioning, parries, stance switching, weapon switching, timed guards, dodges, status effects, combos, environmental hazards, projectiles, ninjutsu, and magic talismans (magic)
[*] The myriad of build possibilities as you progress deeper into the game from the guardian spirit that determines one of three burst counters and transformations you can do, to enemy abilities that you can equip and use, to the randomized gear you might find with different gear sets with a great deal of passives you can modify at the blacksmith, to the multiplayer clan you choose for bonuses, to your stat point allocations, and others - time consuming, but possibilities are there
[/list]

[h2]What I Didn't Like As Much[/h2]
[list][*]The protagonist motivation, a few holes in the story, and story pacing were not as good for me. I'm not sure what it would be like if someone weren't as familiar with events of the Sengoku Jidai or story of Japan's Three Unifiers, but I suspect it would be harder to follow
[*]A large amount of the game's possibilities do not open up until you have completed the game several times to unlock Dream of the Nioh or sometimes referred to as NG+4 / New Game +4
[*]Some technical issues that I haven't revisited since uninstalling the game such as text disappearing at the map screen, infinite loading screens, a stage with light and fog being exceptionally difficult to see unless some graphic settings are turned off, game crashes that sometimes corrupted the Steam download manifest or a save
[*]Never knowing what a legitimate leaderboard looks like and in populated clans, never being able to access the clan-unique tea set that comes with being among the top contributing clan members (this is a 5th / extra tea set that may increase luck on loot drops, money gained, and/or chance to find more tea sets)[/list]

And probably some other things that I can't think of at the moment.

Side Note: You may hear the real game doesn't start until the Depths (beat the game four times, traverse through 100+ floors) or endgame Scrolls. Or you may hear that the first playthrough is just a tutorial for the real game and to keep playing to get to the fun stuff. IF you are not enjoying yourself by the time you complete New Game or by the time of the third region, I honestly cannot recommend continuing to play the game further.",1621666655,1629990089,True,1,0,0.520958065986633301,0,True,False,False

If you've never played nioh, get it on sale if you are on the fence.
But let's focus on this game. For frame of reference. I hate darksouls, I played half of ds3. I prefer more fast paced games like dmc. 
That said, I really enjoy the combat. It's fast and diverse. There are about 7 or 8 weapons off the top of my head with at least 20 different ways to swing them each. Each skill has its own niche. (this skill is for dps in short amount of time, this one is for stamina damage). A small nitpick i have is that even there there is a ""training mode"" where you can spawn enemies and test things out. Theres no plain wooden dummy where I can just test the skills out plainly. How easy can this apply a status effect and etc.
If you do not like the combat in this game then you aren't going to enjoy it at all. Just buy the game, test out each weapon and then decide whether or not you want to refund.",1626836433,1629948031,True,1,0,0.500640213489532471,0,True,False,False

The story is engaging and interesting, with characters from real-world history.
The amount of content is sure to last you a long time. Take me for example: at the time of writing this review, I have 317 hours played. I just yesterday unlocked a new feature that I did not have access to before. Because of this, the replayability factor is high. New game difficulties (think NG+ from Dark Souls) each give you something new, either a new rarity level of gear, or new missions, or an entirely new challenge.
This game is 100% worth your money if you want a (semi) historically accurate, Dark Souls-ish, Mortal Kombat-like combat system, just plain fun game.

Most of my current hours (17 hours when this review is posted) is from me being in the training grounds practicing. I am still stuck in the 2nd region and probably died over +500 times.

Well with me exposing that I'm trash, I really like this game. There's co-op available, AI co-op if you have the materials, you can call for back-up and see if any players will respond do your request, or create a lobby for a friend to join up to 3 people maximum including yourself. The combat mechanics is awesome, you get cool ability trees into many different weapon types. There's this thing you could do to gain back a portion of your stamina by timing a stance change (upper, middle, lower stances) allowing you to extend your combo more or to back when an enemy is about to attack. You also have access to up to 3 amazing yokai transformations.

Some small details I really liked is that your weapon could get bloodied and when you sheath it your character shakes the blood off then sheath the weapon.

A few big negative is weapon loot management; it's all over the place. The controls for PC is a bit unsatisfying.

Nioh 2 is what Onimusha should have evolved into if crapcom wasn't dumb enough to let it rot for more than a decade. 
The combat is fast but its not button mashing, everything pushes you to play aggressive, even the counters and parry weave into a combo pretty fluidly, and generally if you are not attacking then you are getting your ass kicked. A pretty varied move set for the great amount of weapon types you can get...
Finished Nioh 2 on console and I can say that at first the difficulty is decent, its there but its not a big challenge, but then you will hit the first big difficulty spike and damn its hard, there will be moments when you overpower everything just to reach a certain boss and get destroyed enough times to wonder if you just suck, and yes, you do, but the game pushes you to get better and learn the move set of your weapon, because using just one stance and one attack pattern just wont work forever, and some weapons are better than others depending on the situation.

This game takes the term ""Fashion Souls"" to a whole new level, the amount of outfits that look amazing, even mix-and-matched are unreal.  The character creation is great too, although one gripe that I had was that most armors in the game make any changes to the Bust slider on female characters effectively useless, as the bust is almost always hidden.

Now, onto the gameplay, it's fuckin' hard.  That being said, it justifies it's difficulty by departing from the enemy-filled open world that most Souls-like games include, and instead turning to shorter levels with a fixed length.  The combat is smooth and feels amazing, though it requires constant usage of the Ki Pulse mechanic, which can get somewhat annoying as you start to progress further into the game, but it's more of a minor annoyance in the back of your head than a game-breaking annoyance you can't get past.  Speaking of Combat, the amount of weapons in the game is pretty good, you've got Katanas, you've got Nodachis, you've got Tonfas, you've got Spears, all sorts of weapons to choose from, each with their own unique moveset and fighting style.

There are certain gripes that I have, such as the Ogre's Parry being the best out of all the Yokai Form parries, the stupidity of the AI summons and the inability to ""mimic check"" chests (i.e. hit them with your sword) as the mimic that appears in the later levels is somehow immune to any and all damage until you attempt to open the chest, at which point YOU take damage and the mimic becomes an exact copy of you with your moveset and abilities, which you then have to fight in order to receive it's loot.  However, in my opinion, the pros far outweigh the cons, and I definitely see myself playing this for quite some time.

Oh, and you can play it in Coop mode, like, full-on hosted lobbies for coop play.

CONS: It's making me crazy about RNG/ drops, i mean, you have to repeat SAME bosses again and again just to get a ONE specific boss skill unless if the weapon has multiple Boss skills to unlock, you'll get crazy seeing that same boss again",1628155761,1628155761,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TL:DR Version

11/10 would get wrekt attempting to ""git gud"" and have wife school me on how to play again.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

Picked up during Steam Sale for my wife and myself, though the game supports online co-op for up to 3 players. 

Personally, I have played demon souls as well as dark souls 1-3 (finished 1-3). I have also played nioh 1.   While the difficulty to newcomers to these types of games may seem similar, Nioh's combat is different under the hood vs Dark souls.  Blocking serves a purpose, as does knowing when to switch stances, dodge, or counter.  

This may sound obvious but anyone who has played both nioh and dark souls will be able to tell you that there are differences which affect the feel of how combat flows.  People looking to dodge/iframe through everything may initially be in for more pain at the start, as there are certain habits you may have to break in order to prevent needless deaths.

As for my wife's experience/background?  She has never touched a souls-like.  She likes games like the Witcher 2 & 3 (on normal).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Below are excerpts of us during first 10 hours of coop and plenty of deaths

*after getting wrecked on first level*

Me: ""...Damn the combat mechanics  sure are a lot to take in at the start.""

Wife:  ""Holy  ****ing sh**?!""  and ""...What? What!? ......WHAT!???? OH F*** THAT BULL SH**"" and ""WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THIS TO THEMSELVES?"" and ""WHO THE HELL LIKES FEELING LIKE THIS?""  

(Despite initial frustrations she did not give up)

~~~~~Skip ahead to 40+ hours~~~~~~

Me: *Gets downed*  ""Ugh pushed ahead too far and had no Ki to block...""

Wife:  I've noticed you tend to get one, two, or three shot more than me...Maybe try hanging back near/behind me.

Me:  *laughs & smiles*


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Personal Opinions + Closing Remarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graphics:  (Ran on 1080) Great if not outright excellent.  Recommend turning visual effects to low to aid in seeing red flashes (burst counter indicator) or white/black clouds indicating incoming non-block-able grab.

Sound: Above average (audio queues are reliable enough to hear when you should counter or dodge).  If you move cautiously through new levels, certain enemies will give themselves away through ambient noises they make before you engage them.  That being said, some enemies are quiet.  If panning to jump in, I strongly advise that you do not forget to check the ceilings/look up.

Music:  Thematically appropriate.  Forgettable a majority of the time but occasionally great during boss fights and cinematic cut-scenes.

Story:  Average**  There is a narrative but the base game is made for a demographic that has a basic understanding of Japanese history as it applies to the japanese civil warring states period (Sengoku Jidai).  

While the significant characters are historically based, the 'world' of nioh combines historical events and locations with Japanese folklore & mysticism.  A casual gamer jumping in will likely not be able to follow the story or understand major events without reading bio-blurbs in between missions acessable via menus.  A story is there but it will not be spoon fed to you.

Game Loop/Type:  Diablos/Borderlands loot, Souls-like mechanic of die/learn/retry with 2 consecutive death = losing collected exp, Monster Hunter World weapon depth depending on weapon (as well as ability to prep tactically for situations with a plethora of items you can custom bind to up to 8 shortcuts), and Devil May Cry-esque twitch action combat (no direct way to jump however). The games depth and skills become apparent especially mid to late game after you unlock combos, skills, and even hidden weapon skills for more on the fly tactical combat options. 

Online co-op functions differently than single-player.  In pre made groups of 2 or 3, you play in 'expedition' mode.  Your group has shared life gauge.  Party members can revive downed members to avoid penalties or the downed player can choose to self rez.  If bar is depleted then mission ends BUT while party loses the experience accrued up to that point, you can choose to continue from last checkpoint.  Another heads up, Expedition tends to have more enemies than single-player and have higher pools of HP and feel like they do slightly more damage.  

Biggest key difference from single player  is that use of shrines (checkpoints) saves progress and enemies DON'T respawn BUT your consumables are NOT replenished for any use of the shrine after its initial use.  For certain Levels this can make the difference for a boss fight being easy or hard for the group depending on shrine placement.  Don't be afraid to use items/spells in co-op but don't spam them either.  

**NOTE:  If looking to play co-op from the beginning, use the item 'Divine branch' to exit the first level and access the world map.  Have other friendly players do the same.  Have host/leader access the starting point >> Tori Gate >> expedition >> create room WITHOUT conditions and set criteria to 'friends' and choose number of open slots.  Make sure your friends have been added to steam.  Have them go to starting point >> tori gate>> search for rooms using friends criteria and join the host room. 
 

Highly replay value for those interested.  Recommend doing new game + at least once if you are the type who likes to theory craft about builds.

Bugs:  Collectively experienced 1 or 2 over first 80 hours co-op (Both experienced by my wife).  1 was a crash to desktop.  The other was a glitch in a cut-scene and perma-blackscreen requiring forced restart and repeating the mission (for her).



Overall:  Fun single-player/ Online coop distraction during the crazy times we currently live in.

9/10 Mutliplayer: I enjoy it personally, but impatient people who only want to play the game with friends are forced to play a small portion of the beginning alone. I personally see nothing wrong with that, but others complained more often than not in my friend circle.

Overall, try this game if you can, know that not all the cool Hyper-Fiction attacks are unlocked at start, but you WILL be a badass from start to finish if you study and understand what weapons you're using, none are useless, and any combination of weapons and skills can open up new approaches to combat.",1627979083,1627979083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pluses:
- Solid combat system.
- You can't really screw up Yokai, they're always cool
- Enemies require different strategies
- You can skip the entire story
--Seriously, you'll need this, if you're like me and you've got shit to do and don't want this garbage filling up valuable brain space
Minuses:
- Environments are uninspired and super boring
- Monster variety isn't great
- Recycled missions with the same super difficult boss plus also here's an additional boss at the same time (phew, glad we got that idea in before 5pm on Friday night B-) )
- Loot system is atrocious, weapons and armor pour out of every corpses' butthole
-- Makes crafting utterly pointless (but tempering is okay)

I don't know. I can't really recommend this. Its one of those games that if you've got nothing else to play, you want something new, and its on sale. Some good ideas here and there, but if Soulsborne is like eating filet mignon, this is like eating paste.

If you decide through baggy, sunken Souls-veteran eyes that this is something you want to try, a couple of helpful tips:
1. This game *is* hard. I know that's to be expected, but sometimes you get a game that says ""Souls-like"" and all they mean is the respawn system, etc. is in play.
2. This game is not hard like Dark Souls hard. Yes, you'll want to fight a single enemy at a time if you can help it. But this game is more about stamina management and building up an arsenal of useful items in your bag of tricks. This can include special moves that you unlock (THROUGH MANDATORY TUTORIALS, FUCK WHOEVER THOUGHT OF THAT), items and combo moves. Be aggressive, be kind of cheap (shoot people in the head with a gun, then fight them) - the game encourages it.
3. Its an overwhelming system. Every weapon style (fists, magic staves, kurangiamgiaigndjnadj, little sword, big sword, axe, hatchets, anime scythe, double swords, spear, etc.) has like 50 elements you can unlock, and come with three separate stances with different moves, combos, etc. Your stats directly impact the class of weapons, so your build is married to a kind of weapon. I highly recommend the regular old katana with middle stance. You can do literally everything this way, but key to this - high stance does the most damage but uses up the most ki (stamina), low stance uses the least ki but is the weakest, you can guess on middle.
4. Ki (aka Stamina for the rest of the gaming universe) is the single most important thing in the game. You need Ki to attack, if you run out you can't move and can be hit with an attack that will likely immediately kill you (vice versa, you can do a powerful attack against enemies), and without ki your enemies get stunlocked.

So yup

This is, first and foremost, a single player game. Without a dedicated PvP arena, balance decisions are primarily driven by PvE considerations. That frees a HECK of a lot of design space and allows things to be fun which players would complain about if they were allowed to use them on each-other. Don't get me wrong -- I love PvP games, but including PvP in a game like this is a huge decision for that reason. It means playing a completely different balance game, frequently at the expense of the PvE crowd. But I digress. Nioh 2 didn't.

Nioh 2 has a huge number of maps, some of which are recycled for use for sidequests. This is mostly fine. The world is not one huge interconnected space as you see in the FromSoft games, but the total space is still quite large. It's mature, but it's not unrepentantly bleak and existentially dreadful. It's a hodge-podge of Japanese folklore and history. The story is passable.

There is a large set of very developed weapons (think the Monster Hunter series) rather than an absolutely huge set of relatively simple weapons (Dark Souls). Weapon crafting and builds are much more developed than Dark Souls. Think ARPG level. It is possible to make your toon absolutely busted in the endgame. Ki-pulsing lends combat an interesting rhythm I haven't seen in other games.

Altogether, this is a great intersection of fun and challenging which defines itself enough from its predecessors to stand on its own. The story is somewhat superficial, but you're playing for the mechanics and action, which are stellar. It doesn't have PvP (and wouldn't be as good if it did) so if that's what you want, look elsewhere.

The combat is super engaging; you will continue to unlock and discover new abilities and tech to use, especially with the many different weapons like swords, axes/hammers, glaive, spear, split staff, etc.

So many cool as heck characters and creatures to encounter. Unlocking the story adds to every character and enemy's profile description where you inspect their models, read their lore and current affiliations, all sorts of cool things.

Armors/weapons all look sick, your character appears as-is in all cut scenes. you can do full character change at any point in the game. 


The DOWNSIDES, it is very difficult (duh), and you still feel kind of weak defensively throughout the game. Your enemies scale close to you. Usually takes 2-4 hits to die. You'll probably die a lot, but it's forgiving in terms of what you lose. Double death means you lose all of your Amrita (used to lvl up), and that's about it.

Where the previous game set the foundation, world and engine technicalities for KOEI TECMOS (same people that did Ninja Gaiden btw) take on the souls genre, this sequel is one of those examples of what a sequel should be. Boasting a fantastic character creator, a combat system that rivals the best ones out there, a long albeit mediocre story, retelling of history in Japan in the Sengoku period. Don't expect fantastic story-telling in this regard, but expect to be able to learn so much from this time period in Japan with an abundance of written sources in the game through character histories, places, yokai myths, and map diagrams.

So this presentation is already great with an inspired art direction blending fantasy and realism into the Sengoku feudal periods, having both authentic recreations of Samurai weapons and armor that exist still today, to wilder creatures inspired from Japansese yokai folklore. The UI is heavily stylised as well with big indicators that might look jarring at first like with many Japanese games, something about their UI design philosophies pollute alot of information on screen all the time. But like I said that's only jarring at first, with alot of it being very customizable and sizeable to your liking. Without a surprise, the Japanese voice dub is expertly voiced given the story being a backseat, but please lord do not change to the english dub, why would you? This game is set in Japan, embrace your weeb.  

Back to the combat, it's really just phenomenal and nothing that lives up to it. Fast paced weapon combat with 11 types of weaponry each with their own huge expansive moveset, and three different stances[b] for each of these weapons.[/b] Not including any of the ranged weapons and magic options that scale differently with your build. However with this games expansive content, with multiple increasingly difficult NG+ cycles called ""Way of the Samurai, Strong, Demon, Wise, Nioh."" Magic becomes a very needed necessity in the later difficulties and the higher tier content you will be faced with. Aiding in your survivability, damage output, or even slowing down your enemy to a snails pace. 

If you're a fan of Souls-like games or even desire a new challenge to your finessed gamer skills, pick up Nioh 2 and be enveloped into it for hours on end with more content than you probably paid for, and never be satisfied with another combat system in any other game.

Lets start with the new stuff that comes with this game that i definitely like:
- more weapons, available right from the start
- The character creator is really cool, surprisingly detailed and the option to share creations is a definite plus 

Moving on to combat. Overall it is still a difficult game, but contrary to most other reviews, game appears to be easier than its predecessor due to:
- game plays largely similar to the first one, so veterans of Nioh will find it a bit underwhelming in difficulty because of a lack of learning curve
- all weapons are viable, but some weapons like switchglaive and odachi certainly makes the game much easier
- acolytes, with the right buffs, can tank bosses relatively well, lowering the boss difficulty even further
- the new yokai parrying mechanic makes ki draining of yokais so much easier than before
- some yokai abilities are very powerful vs certain bosses or just in general, eg. yatsu-no-kami's ability

I very much like the challenge, although I am far from being a good player. I very much appreciate that there are many ways to tackle the difficult challenges and you are not stuck with a single winning strategy. When I die, an often occurrence, I know what I did wrong. Every death is a learning experience and an opportunity to build skill with your weapon. 

I love the depth and the variety of enemies. I like the intricacies and the complexity, although it can be quite a bit to learn. 

The downside to this game is that it is difficult to learn all of the intricacies of the game. There is a steep learning curve, but the curve at least has a slope. The enemies punish you. Tackling more than one at a time is risky. If you love casting magic, be warned that you should be prepared to swing a weapon for quite a while before your skills advance. The nice thing is that there are basically two magic trees, one that scales with a Magic statistic, and another with Dexterity. Both have benefits and you often use both.

I found using a controller (PS4) works best for me. I did not try mouse and keyboard, although I have played other games without a controller. 

I enjoy the game, but be warned. You need to pay attention and have your wits and reflexes to do well. Dying often can be frustrating at first, very much so.

The gameplay is pure perfection. 
============================
Character customization is insanely deep, :-

- There are 11 melee weapon types and 3 ranged weapon types, Ninja and Onmyo Magic skills. The more you use the weapons(Ninja and Onmyo) the more skill points you get and get to spend them on weapon(Ninja/Onmyo) skill trees get new attacks and abilities and so on.

- Yokai abilities, Weapons combinations, Armor sets, all can be acquired from mobs or you can forge your  own equipments at the blacksmith and temper(changing the stats on the equipment) and customize them further. Mix and match to create your own character builds and playstyle.

- You can even Refashion(transmog) your weapons and armor.

==================================================
The game is decently difficult, coming from Team Ninja who made the notoriously difficult Ninja Gaiden games.
Combat is meaty and satisfying, boss fights are fun and challenging. Hard but fair.

================================================
Most games nowadays focus on Story with long and tiresome cutscenes while sacrificing great and fun gameplay. Give us shallow and empty open world as an excuse to make the game feels big(Except Bethesda and Rockstar open world games). Nioh 2 remedied that by giving us deep, fun and satisfying gameplay.

God I really want to like this game. I love the souls-like genre, and I usually like these big(ish) budget games which take their inspiration from the Fromsoft games, but damn Nioh 2 is flawed to all hell.

Rather than having primarily tough but rewarding gameplay, the game is wildly unfair and downright frustrating with really forgiving mechanics (more healing, faster pace, faster stamina regen, etc.) but disproportionally dramatic increase in arbitrary elements of enemy difficulty (more health/damage) to overcompensate. That having been said, there are enough redeeming qualities that if you're a glutton for punishment like me, and you really like souls-likes, you'll find a lot to enjoy.

The core gameplay (general combat, combos, variety of weapon types, etc.) is decent, and human enemies are fun. The general aesthetic, level design, and mission structure is all solid. Also, the multiplayer elements are pretty unique and excellently implemented.

However Yokai enemies generally kind of suck imo, and unfortunately they make up about 70% of enemies in the game. Most enemies and bosses feel difficult, not because they mechanically present a challenge, but because of arbitrarily unbalanced/un-tuned elements: most enemies have one shot/one kill combos (even with the highest armour, enemies will absolutely destroy you, and virtually every hit you take will force an immediate heal); enemy health is often obscenely high; levels are absolutely littered with copious ambushes and cheap enemy positioning; the game severely caps your access to ranged ammunition, preventing it from being a core combat mechanic (usually you just use them to level the playing field against otherwise bs elements like picking off a mob hiding in a tree, etc. to ambush you).

The character/inventory management is extremely un-intuitive, but serviceable I suppose once you get used to it.

In addition, the story is pretty mediocre, despite the amazing setting and art direction. Plays out like bad historical fan-fiction littered with tired/mediocre tropes and pretty awful dialogue. However, the near encyclopedic lists of enemies, allies, characters, etc. and their stories/histories are pretty cool, and make for a welcome addition to the genre (can take a break if you want and just read about the lore of certain enemies, etc.).

Overall, if you're itching for another souls-like game, go for it. But go in knowing this game feels like only partially successful imitation of better mechanics and games, and relies heavily on arbitrary factors to artificially inflate the difficulty.",1626387683,1626658556,True,0,0,0.49903985857963562,0,True,False,False

Sometimes sometimes your supposed to block and other dodge, but there are completely inconsistent ""I-frames"" so on the dodges, half the times it hits you anyways. Tons of zones that slow ki regen which are just non fun areas for combat, always feeling like a slog.

This review is going to be focused on 5 areas of the game: Combat System and Gameplay, Story Telling, Difficulty, End Game Grind, and lastly Graphic and Animation.

----------Combat System and Gameplay - 9/10----------

The fluid combat mechanism is where this game shines. There are 12 different weapon classes in this game and each weapon offers their unique attack pattern and attributes. There is no clear Meta or build that you have to follow if you are playing through the game the first time (end game is different, more on this later). Each weapon has 3 stances (upper, mid, lower) which changes the weapon attach pattern depending on which stance you are in; this offers each weapon a lot of flexibility and allowing players to quickly adjust depend on the situation. On top of that, each weapon class also has many unique skills (the skill proficiency can be acquired the more you use that weapon class). Making it quite enjoyable to experiment between different weapon classes and playstyles.
 
----------Story Telling - 6/10----------
The Story telling is good but not great. This is where the game is lacking in my opinion. 
The story is a blend of Japanese folklore, history and with some mystic twist added to it. The storyline itself is okay, but the story telling is very mediocre. It lacks the necessary character development to make player invested in the story and the fate of each character. The story transitions also does not feel cleanly executed; It feels rushed and not well explained. I can see it can be a struggle, for many players, to understand what is happening sometime, if you are not well-versed in Japanese history.  
The protagonist also does not speak a word for the entirety of the story, which really make the story felt disjointed. And also due to that very reason, the action of the protagonist sometime seems illogical and we as players don‚Äôt really have a clear understanding of his/her motives and thoughts even though we are actively controlling and playing as the main character. 

----------Difficulty 8/10----------
The difficulty can be vastly different dependent on if you play alone without any help, or online with Friends. 
The first playthrough can be very frustrating if you choose to play alone without help. The mini boss can kill you in one or two hits or you can get ganked by multiple enemies, and the environment can also add a bit challenge.  But the game does offer a lot of help if you are struggling; you can summon blues to help you clear an area, or you can summon player at the shrine. And if you are really struggling at a mission, you can even play together with a friend/online player. 

----------End Game Grind - 8/10----------
The Game consists of 5 difficulties: Dream of Samurai, Dream of Strong, Dream of Demon, Dream of Wise and Dream of Nioh. 
The end game grind is essentially consist of 108 level of underworld and 30 level of depth once you reached Dream of Nioh. The 108 levels of underworld are fairly flexible, you can make pretty much any build work. With the luck drop introduced, its fairly easy to get the gear and graces that you desire. However, once you go pass 108 levels and the first 10 level of depth. The content can be very challenging, you build is likely maxed out at this point and the bosses can still kill you in a few hits. On top of that your spells do not reset after each boss encounter (for the same level) and the boss also heals a lot fast. But hi its okay, this is very last bit of the end game content, and it was not supposed to be easy.
I didn‚Äôt find the end game grind crazily overbearing and provides a lot of freedom to experiment with different builds. 

----------Graphic and Animation - 8/10----------
Graphic and Animation are pretty good. The texture and environment looked nice, and animation is pretty smooth.  

Overall, I really enjoyed this game. Would highly recommend it to players who enjoy soul like game play, great combat system and the RNG grind.

The second installment in the Nioh franchise, the game is a hack-and-slash game that incorporates magical abilities of Japanese demons called ""Yokai"". Similarly to the Dark Souls franchise, this game requires high level of skills and hand-eye coordination due to the fact you may easily be overwhelmed by enemy units in the game. Enemies are overall difficult due to their relentless powerful attacks that can easily kill the player early on in the game.

The game, very much like the Dark Souls franchise, also requires the player to increase in levels and farm better loot to move on against more powerful enemies. Another game that can be compared to this game is ""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"" (also from the creators of the ""Dark Souls"" franchise) as it is set in feudal japan.

This game also allows PvE mode, where we can request assistance from other players within a mission. Slightly disappointed that the game is not fully open-world as players will return to the ""map"" after each quest.

Not much details during the tutorial phase, again, like ""Dark Souls"" franchise. This causes the player to experiment and learn the game mechanics themselves without hand-holding.

A very big fan of the brutal dismemberment within this game that is not available within the ""Dark Souls"" franchise or ""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"".

[h1]Controls[/h1]
As a player whom prefer using keyboards, the controls are rather complicated. Overall had to change and customize the controls accordingly to play properly.

For the PC, using Keyboard and Mouse, there seems to be some delays in commands, specifically blocking and dodging.

Example 1: Blocking on-point, but the commands do not register, and enemy attacks go through the block. Had tested on other games like ""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"" and other games with no issues. Had tested against enemy bosses and in the dojo multiple times and used different mouse, seems inconsistent.

Example 2: Had tested against bosses and in the dojo to dodge enemy attacks. Same case with blocking, the command input seems delayed for a few milliseconds, and this can cause you to die in a fight.

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]
With the complex controls, the mechanics of the game is over-complicated compared to ""Dark Souls"" franchise or ""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"". Players require to manage their stamina called ""Ki"" a lot to perform both offensive and defensive maneuvers. How well players manage their ""Ki"" will define their survivability throughout a playthrough.

Forging or Tempering (upgrading your weapon/armor stats) in this game heavily relies on RNG. You will be doing a lot of Forging/Tempering to get specific builds you need. Most cases, just use existing items from drops until New Game+.

Enemy AI is not too bad as they will randomize attacks on the player, making it a challenge for the player. Even the low level enemies are damage sponges which causes the game to become tedious and dull altogether. Pure utter garbage boss designs, they basically cheese you in most cases.

Your character is a [b]half-yokai with ""powers"" but having a stamina of a decrepit old man[/b]. You can barely block or dodge enemy attacks that it's not even funny.

Blocking and dodging is not even worth it in this game due to the fact it has extremely little I-frames and consumes too much ""Ki"", making you unable to perform combos after dodging or blocking. Had even tested parrying on multiple occasions and found that its is high risk with low rewards, hence, not worth doing. Might as well not even try to block or dodge as it consumes so much ""Ki"" and requires extreme amount of recovery time that is beyond stupid. Enemies are not restricted to these issues, they are basically damage sponges (both HP and Ki), doing large AOE attacks that can stun lock you if you are in a bad position within the environment you are fighting in. You will not be able to do ""flashy"" attacks in this game, like in ""Devil May Cry"" franchise as it is basically not worth it to perform continuous attacks on enemy bosses due to the lack of damage and high ""Ki"" usage to block/dodge enemy bosses continuous attacks.

To actually defeat enemies, all you need to do is dodge/run far away (running consumes less ""Ki"" compared to dodging) and attack them bit by bit until they die or punishing them when they finish performing an attack with long recovery time, since you cannot perform combos due to the ""Ki"" draining out too fast (even with Ki Pulse used). These mechanics make the fights tedious, unfulfilling and downright boring in comparison to games like ""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"". You do extremely mediocre damage whilst enemies can two shot you with insanely large hit-box attacks. Enemy projectiles also has superb tracking, combined with them attacking at the same time, you can instantly die if overwhelmed (You will need to take out enemies one-by-one, unless you are focusing in playing AOE Magic/Ninjutsu). Overall, the game makes the player handicapped and this removes the enjoyment factor.

Another issue is when the camera gets stuck on the wall during fights in confined spaces (where many bosses fight in). As the camera makes the environment transparent, this causes you to get stuck during a fight especially when there are obstacles. This causes enemies to stun-lock you until you die.

[h1]Audio/Video[/h1]
Overall audio and video quality are very nice and superbly optimized for PC. However, there are lack of animations when interacting with the side characters or when you are in ""map"" mode. It would be great if all interactions with NPCs are fully animated.

[h1]Bugs/Issues[/h1]
1. So far, no FPS drops when running the game at maximum graphics with RTX2080
2. There seems to be a bug with the boss ""Erenra"", one time, when he goes ""Dark Realm"", he becomes completely invisible with exception to the orange part of his chest. When the ""Dark Realm"" finishes, he is still invisible. I've checked multiple videos on this fight, and it seems to be a bug.

[h1]Cosmetics/Customization[/h1]
You may create and customize your main character's appearance similarly to ""Dark Souls"" franchise along with selecting multiple types of weapons. Your demon (Yokai) form is also customizable to some extent which is quite nice.

The character customization option is quite in-depth, which most games do not have (most have preset characters and limited editing).

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
This game requires time to learn the mechanics and how to overcome the various archetypes of enemies. For hardcore players, this game is quite nice, but can be improved. Not for casual players, as you will die a lot until you've learned all the mechanics.

The game levels are quite dull, your character being a powerful ""Yokai"" can't even jump or swim which doesn't make sense. With that said, this game overall is decent in terms of graphics, but difficulty-wise feels more handicapped rather than fair as you have multiple skill-sets, but can barely use any of them consistently due to high ""Ki"" consumption even for basic actions like blocking or dodging, coupled with ""Ki"" reduction in the ""Yokai"" realm. As mentioned, enemies also take very little damage and can 1 or 2-shot the player with large hitbox attacks.

All these factors combined takes away the satisfaction of defeating enemies as eventually you will have to resort to hit-and-run method rather than performing punishing combos like you can do in games like ""MHW: Iceborn"", ""Devil May Cry franchise"", ""Dark Souls franchise"", ""The Witcher franchise"" and ""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"".

For hardcore players, this game is tolerable. For those still interested in this game, purchase only when on sale. It is not worth the full price when compared to the games already highlighted.",1624980726,1626313792,False,1,0,0.419798552989959717,0,True,False,False

If you combine the tightrope walking with silver knight archers of Anor Londo, along with the level design of Dark Chasm of Old in Drangleic Castle, as well as the arena-like fight of the optional boss fight in Cave of the Dead from Crown of the Sunken King ‚Äì but [i]all the time[/i]. Then you would have summarised how this game works.

It's graphics are nice to look at, whenever the environment isn't popping in constantly. The cutscenes are well choreographed, but locked at horrible 30 FPS. You have a lot of options to customise your character both in looks and functionality, although it's awfully bloated and needlessly convoluted. Story is practically non-existent, but that's not why you are playing this game for.

While not in a mission the game is full of ""it's nice, but..""-moments like mentioned above. When you are within a mission you are locked within tight corridors, tiny rooms, instant-kill ambushes, and pitfalls. Sometimes both of the last two at the same time.
It makes for an extremely frustrating and unrewarding experience similar to a playground bully kicking you into a muddy ditch/hole, several times a day, without any telegraph or forewarning ‚Äì and the playground has the topography of a cheese grater.
This kills the pacing as you have to inch your way forward with the block button taped down walking over small bridges, through tiny doorways, across fallen narrow trees, and rooftop edges ‚Äì unless you want to be grabbed and instantly killed by Yokai or kicked off a cliff. Doubly so when the edges are concave and are very slippery. Even further when you have to pull three, four, five, or even six Yokai, one by one, across these gaps into what could be passably described as a 'fairly open area' by this game's standards - the size of the elevator itself from Firelink Shrine to New Londo Ruins.

All fights with trash mobs feel like cheap shots, while only [i]some[/i] of the boss fights in this game are genuinely enjoyable, and all of them are battles with Yokai.

I actually prefer the predecessor, Nioh, over this game. Simply because of a smaller amount of egregious cheap shots in it. Except for the mission The Ocean Roars Again, that one can die in a fire.",1626282859,1626282859,False,0,3,0,0,True,False,False

This game is basically Nioh 1 but improved in so many ways that Nioh 1 is made irrelevant by comparison. Nioh 1 suffered from a few main problems.

1. The enemies moved way too fast for you (boss wise really and some Yokai) to react to in a reasonable way. Nioh 1 suffered a lot from enemies zipping and zooming across the screen and doing near chunks of your health bar if you dared run low armor builds. Nioh 2 adds Burst Counters, which while not perfect at registering, (I've had times where I did do the move and it didn't register and instead acted like I moved to left or right for no reason) still allow you to react much more readily and even punish the high speed enemies with quick reflexes and rewarding you with a good chunk of ki damage, removing curse status for longer than a grapple (Curse of the Demon+) and even regular HP damage. All in all, huge improvement!

2. There weren't really that many choices for builds. This might be on me, so I'll say that in advance, but it really did feel like Spear became the only real great choice the later on you got. I never went insanely far into Nioh 1 due to the 3rd point so I do get that it might just me as a player, but it felt like the option for builds were limited due to the speed issue I mentioned in the first point alongside the damage issue mentioned there too. Given the fixes to the first point and the addition of Switchglaive and Fists, Nioh 2 boasts a much better range of weapon builds due to balancing of the skill tree and expanding how it was before.

3. The damage was insane for how little you could react too. Again, this might be on me, but it felt like I was almost always getting one shot by the enemies in Nioh 1 given how it would be from a really fast attack that I had nothing I could react with.

And those aren't even the only improvements that were made, many more such as expanding the story before and past where Nioh 1 stepped down as well as just making the stages more fun to get through makes playing through the higher difficulties a lot more fun to me. If you liked Nioh 1, or wanted to while not being able to get over some of the faults the game had, I highly recommend giving Nioh 2 a shot; it's a lot of fun and I bet you'll enjoy it.",1626165287,1626165287,True,1,0,0.500640213489532471,0,True,False,False

[list]
[*] It is a Soulslike, similar to e.g. Dark Souls and Bloodborne;
[*] It is a technical action game, similar to e.g. Devil May Cry and Ninja Gaiden;
[*] It is a looter game, similar to e.g. Diablo and Borderlands.
[/list] 
More precisely, it starts with the basic combat and level design formula from Soulslikes. It then layers a ton of advanced mechanics and obscure tech on top, letting skilled players speed up the game to a point where it doesn't really look like Souls anymore; the game is complex enough to have people making dedicated combo videos. Finally, it uses an ARPG-like random loot system that even keeps evolving through four New game plus -levels, providing a long grindy postgame.

Whether this game is for you depends on how many of the listed three core genres you like. If you like just one, it may be a risky pick, as the other genres may detract from the experience: for example a pure soulslike fan might find the combat middling in the genre if they don't focus on the technical aspects, a pure stylish action fan might find the RPG mechanics and a lack of scoring systems off-putting, or a pure ARPG fan might be turned back by the less forgiving difficulty curve of Soulslikes. Liking two of the three genres is however already a good sign that the game has a decent chance of become one of your favorites; people who get absorbed into it can spend a long time with it.


Nioh 2 is the second game in the series; it feels very similar to the first, but with more polish. Many of the less liked parts of the first game have been addressed: the previously low enemy variety has been improved, there are less ""annoying"" instances of challenge, and the game is better balanced. Hence, especially the postgame experience of Nioh 2 is far superior to Nioh 1, and the remaining reasons to play the first one are now mainly the story and its levels/bossfights. In terms of story, Nioh 2 is a prequel, and the story of Nioh 1 is mostly irrelevant throughout it; however, there is one short part which heavily ties into the story of Nioh 1.",1626036937,1626037395,True,1,0,0.52519381046295166,0,True,False,False

1. Great graphics, model, animations.
2. Tolerable story line.
3. Lots of loot.
4. Complex battle mechanics with lots of weapons and key combinations.
5. Supports multiplayer and NPC summons.

CONS:
1. 99% of the loot is useless and needs to be sold for boosters and ammunition.
2. Mechanics can be overwhelmingly complex, leaving the most of the super-attacks unused.
3. Most of the items and boosters are so weak they are almost useless.
4. You can't co-op. You can be summoned AFTER you already completed the map, thus playing the map multiple times. If you want to have a time with your friends - this is not it.
5. The map progress is lost after you leave the map. If you return to the map later on, all in-map progress is forgotten, enemies, bosses, semi-bosses are back in place.

We design human enemies too, they have stamina just like you. Except it's much more longer and now they wield heavy weapons like nothing, fast and high damage!

Tell a story?
Yes! As few conversations as possible, and make seems-cool-but-empty short cutscenes every time the characters suddenly begin to tell you their past even if you didn't ask! Best of all, after those history these characters still feel empty!

It's best enjoyed with Japanese voice-over, and it's honestly a game I will never tire of playing over and over.
That said, figuring out multiplayer with friends is a bit tricky, as at least using the option of playing with friends doesn't seem to work if the person joining hasn't completed the mission that the host is trying to summon for.

Every character and interaction is rooted deep in Japanese history and Shinto lore, and a believable world is something I love. If you get serious about end-game content, there's a lot of mechanics to make your perfect build and whatnot. Everything hits like a truck and beating enemies after they rinse you feels great; I gave out a victory roar after defeating Ren Hayabusa for the first time. That happens often. The other major attraction is that the game has very solid co-op for up to three players with the ""Expeditions"" mechanic, unlike Soulsborne games (it does have a separate Soulsborne-like ""summon help"" mechanic, however.)

Despite that, I cannot recommend it at this time. Why? Because the game STILL has stability issues, almost 6 months after launch for a major subset of users, and it's a serious issue for me and my friends. Personally, my own game is stable with patch 1.27.02 and runs great (Ryzen 5600X/RTX 2080). My buddy who I play with also has a stable game (Ryzen 3600X/AMD Radeon) as of 1.27.02.

But our third friend, who loves Souls games, and who we wanted to be our third player in Expeditions is playing with Intel Xe graphics (i7-1165g7 laptop) and absolutely CAN NOT get the game to run in a stable manner. It crashes within 10 minutes of gameplay at various points, every single time. The graphical capabilities of the laptop are fine; it runs at a smooth FPS when it works, and Xe is a huge step up over Intel UHD graphics. But again, it always crashes without fail. He cannot complete the first mission. This is completely unacceptable; Expeditions and three player co-op is a major attraction that elevates this game above Soulsborne games, but the fact our friend can't play after we harangued him into buying it is extremely, extremely disappointing.

Games like this are challenging and incredible with co-op, but it MUST be rock solid in terms of stability for that to pan out. It HAS to work, ALL THE TIME. Beyond that, 70% of steam users are on integrated graphics, often worse than my friends laptop, and many users report similar problems even after 1.27.02 on the forums. This isn't acceptable. It not acceptable for this game to only work for people who can spend $2000 USD on a gaming rig, especially now that GPUs alone cost $1000 USD.

Modern AAA games are complex; I get it. Koei seems committed to maintaining this game, and I suspect more patches will come. I will continue to play. I hope they continue fixing it. But I won't change my review to positive until my third friend can actually run this game without it crashing and join us in Expeditions, because frankly the disappointment that he can't join us is immense. Maybe it's a graphics driver bug, maybe it's a game engine bug; it doesn't really matter at the end of the day. Koei needs to find the solution and help get it fixed.",1625860945,1625861388,False,6,0,0.469921857118606567,0,True,False,False

Now there are A LOT! I mean A LOT of games that claim to be ""Souls-like"" and aren't, they basically just use the tag to sell games. I'll be completely honest, I did not like the first Nioh, I bought it the day it came out after playing the demo, and I enjoyed the demo but after getting a few bosses in it started to get very stale and repetitive. There was a huge lack of weapons, and a huge staple in most Souls-like games is the character creation which Nioh 1 lacked. Couple that with a very low verity of weapons and it just didn't do it for me. 
So on to Nioh 2, For me Nioh 2 checked all the boxes that Nioh 1 missed and then some. Nioh 2 has an incredibly detailed character creation (Honestly it's more in depth than any of the souls games and that is saying a lot!) The combat feels so much better than the first, they added a ton of weapon archetypes my fav being the Switchblade which is basically a great scythe! The summoning a friend system works a ton better than in the first, and there is usually 1 or 2 NPC summons outside every boss fog so if you're having trouble with a boss you can summon help. Nioh 2 also added way more build verity than the first making the replayability value through the roof. 
So all in all if you're a fan of the Soulsborne series and were maybe a little weary on this game because of not liking the first I would say def give this a try it feels soo much better than the original. Hope this helps :-)",1625839553,1625839553,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

[h1]My Opinion[/h1]

 I haven't paid full price for a game in a very long time. I feel like I didn't pay enough for how awesome and intense this game is in it's delivery of challenging and visually pleasing action gameplay. In summary, I highly recommend this game for anyone who has played and loved Nioh, Dark Souls, or Ninja Gaiden. For everyone else, this game may or may not be for you depending on how you feel about its component game mechanics. Personally I enjoyed my whole time with the game and it is the only game I've cleared 100% in a long, long time. A+ 10/10 from me.

[h1]General Assessment[/h1]

For people who may not match 100% with this game I will talk about what this game includes so you can make up your own decision on whether you want to play the game or not.

Some people say the [b]Story[/b] isn't very good and I cannot help but agree with that. It is essentially a generic adventure story with a few rather obvious and overly foreshadowed twists. However, I will say that the story is just a narrative excuse to having you take on the well constructed levels, enemies, and bosses. In true ARPG style, the Story doesn't matter all that much.

Some people say that the Nioh 2 has a ton of [b]grind[/b] baked into the game. I would again say that I agree, but only to some extent. This game operates in the classic Diablo 2 formula of ascending difficulties. So you will start the game in the Dream of the Samurai (Normal Difficulty) and you can only play harder levels and reach higher levels once you clear the game and the subsequent NG+ modes. This segment of gameplay is not a grind for the most part as, and it is counterintuitive, but you can clear all the difficulties through to Dream of the Nioh (the Final Difficulty) just with what you naturally find in levels and not having to do all the side missions.

The grind lives once you reach Dream of the NIoh because there is a rather astounding difficulty spike. This increase in difficulty may require you to finally spend some time farming the right equipment to put together a durable and damaging build in order to tackle the endgame. The only way you survive at this point without trying to maximize the benefits of your equipment, soul cores, and weapon skills is if you are just perfect mechanically, which is almost no one alive. I personally like this because it forces you, in the final challenge, to think about your build and maximize your play style. This game has itemization that is comparable to games like Diablo 2, Last Epoch, and loosely like Path of Exile. There are equipment sets, crafting, and magic find here, so if you don't like numbers and getting BIG damage, this may be the time you hop off the game. Which for me, reaching the endgame, was about 80 hours into my playthrough.

This game has a ton of content and challenge. If you understand the role of ARPG stories, don't mind some grinding, and love fast paced, high skill action combat, then get this game [b]RIGHT NOW[/b] at literally any price. It's one of the best games ever made in the souls-lke environment.

But if you feel this way in this game at first, I can assure you, it will get better.
I remember I felt with the second boss in the game ""This cant be true, there is no way to defeat this"".But with time, you get accustomed to the game, and actually you really Git Gud with some time. Yes, it has a deep learning, you really have to focus on enemies attack patterns, and timing of your attacks/parry/dodge.
But oh boy when you get into the game, you get a lot of nice goodies to work with, and you actually feel powerful in the game. I've played the souls games, and I always felt, Its good, but still usually I was doing okay against most enemies. 
Here if you use your wits, and every item/skill that the game offers you, with the skills you develop you actually feel powerful. A mere foot soldier still can kill you if caught off guard, but not so often maybe.

I liked the japanese style/theme/lore also, the story is nice, not great but its cool I think.
Graphics usually look very nice, sometimes here and there ""meh"".

I enjoyed every minute of it. The art style is beautiful, the weapons WAY more interesting than anything Dark Souls had to offer, both in design and animation.

While still difficult, it doesn't have the insane, random difficulty spikes that 1 had, and the experience is much smoother overall. Armour actually matters in 2, and best of all, you're not required to grind out side missions just to keep your level even with the content. And there's a lot of content. At almost 200 hours, I'm still bouncing between NG+ missions and the DLC (which I'm now hugely over-leveled for, but some of the bosses are still a big challenge for me). 

I am a huge fan of Dark Souls 1-3, and after despising Nioh, Nioh 2 really fills the void, but don't take that to mean it's anything like DS. While there's some surface similarities, Nioh is a different game altogether, and I find Nioh 2 on one hand less difficult than any DS game (YMMV), I also find it also has deeper, more satisfying combat, but less interesting level design and world building.

It also has a feature where you can summon an NPC version of another player to help out for a while. While the AI is *truly awful* a lot of the time, they can still help by taking some hits before they die while you figure out what's going on.

TL;DR, if you like the DemonSouls genre but didn't like Nioh 1, this is worth checking out, because it improved pretty much every aspect of 1.",1624506156,1624883420,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There are at least two bosses that made me want to quit entirely, but I still wanted to see how it ended and kept going. It has some of the best bosses in the series but also some of the worst, and most of the new basic enemies are a chore to fight at best.

This game is good in many ways and has been fun (as one can see from the hours played) but I don't recommend it for most people. 

If you belong to the psychotic (yes literally) ""git gud crowd"", whose self-esteem hinges on being able to brag about stuff you did in a video game, then sure; This game may be for you (just don't hurt anyone when you are tossing furniture around because pretty much any of the bosses wrecked you unfairly again) but for anyone else, give this game a pass. 

Team Ninja are known for ""hard games"" but the thing is, this game isn't hard. It's actually fairly easy most of the time. The problem is that the game is unfair. This mainly concerns the bosses and a few ""generic"" enemies. 

Even fans who proclaim their love for this game with heartfelt song admit this (the sane ones at least). 

Now, some bosses are optional (and they are by FAR the worst offenders) but when I'm forced to smell the bull**** in varying degrees, literally every single session, that sort of grinds me down (I imagine it's just like the aforementioned crack cocaine in that regard. It may have felt good at some point but it keeps getting less and less interesting every time and you know it hurts you and that you should stop before your controller breakes). 

I can't go into details without spoiling but lets just say bosses never cease to surprise you with how much bull**** they can toss your way and how much the next boss can trumph the one before in this single regard. I'd say I'm generally a pretty calm dude but this game has me raging almost every session (sometimes multiple times), sometimes I get so flabbergasted by the amount of **** this game takes right in my face that I just ALT+F4 without even reacting to it further and I pretend I did not just waste the last hours of my life doing something that made me feel horrible... willingly. 

The one-hit-kills with insane tracking, speed and range, in cluttered small arenas. All enemies (not just the bosses though ofc they are the worst offenders) have too much life (I'd say most have more than the player. By that I mean even the grubbiest of ronins and the most pathetic of Yokais). Some of them heal themselves, others can spam magic that is harder, better, faster, stronger than dedicated mage-builds, while still being able to ""poise"" (tank) massive hits from heavy weapons. Some have instant-kill grab-attacks that they like to do when they are low on life.

I'm all down with the type of gaming formula where we are all (both players and enemies) made of wet tissuepaper and have to use skill, reflexes and smarts to progress. I'm also a fan of more laid back games where it's more of a forgiving grind, enemies take unrealistic hits but so can the player. 
I am not a fan of the formula that says I have to hit a boss around 253 times in a row while he/she/it can one-shot me at anytime and under very unfair circumstances. 

I am not sure it was always true when people proclaimed ""Dark souls is hard but fair"" but everyone understood what that meant. I can tell you that ""Nioh 2 is (often) easy but very unfair"". 

So, I guess the reason I don't recommend this game is that it actually makes me angry, frustrated and stressed. Which is pretty much the opposite of what a videogame exists to do (even the punishing ones are at least meant to give you kicks of happiness and accomplishment in between the suffering to make it worth your while).",1624289685,1624290231,False,29,6,0.52064824104309082,0,True,False,False

My only gripes are a couple of particularly unfair enemies, and how the endgame becomes an ceaseless Diablo-esque grind.  But most players probably won't make it to the true endgame before getting tired of it, so that's not too many points against the game.

Nioh default key binding not the best, but good to manage all of it, but it take a time to research and training.

- My big problem with this game is fps drop even all low setting and lowest render resolution. I use GTX 750ti graphic card and i play Nioh 1 so smooth, 55-60fps, rarely drop fps, but in Nioh, often drop fps to 40 even lower 35. After research, i found some video and people give me some advice to help and fix it, but that's not the best at all. At least, it can playable for me. Now just sit and wait for fix patch. The game itself is good, but the port is not.

- About content, there's some new fighting mechanic make game more interesting than Nioh 1 (character stats, skill point per weapon, balance yokai damage, Burst system, Soul Core, etc...), new unique weapons and new moves for each old weapon. Story is not rich, but it related to Nioh 1, if you played Nioh 1, then you can get behind story about Spirit Stone, the timeline was before Nioh 1 (Nioh 2 => Nioh 1). Character creation system allow you make your own character is one of my favorite content. However, there's still less content and have some limit to create character.  Co-op online system also good system of this game. You can enjoy game with your friends. Fight and help each other and together, but for some hardcore players, this is not quite good system. Co-op online make game more easier and it no longer Soul-like game.

+ If you're new player and you want to try Soul-like game, i recommend you this game (because it more easier than Dark Soul and another Soul-like games to try)
+ If you're keyboard player, or real PC player and you don't want to use controller, then you should research and training with Nioh default keyboard- keyboard & mouse setting. It is the good way to manage all action in game (but you still need to rebinding your keys for best experience, it's not the best way). If not, then use controller or don't buy this game
+ If you're fan of samurai-ninja-exorcist, or at least fan of Japan culture, then this is one of good game for it. You can become a brave samurai, or become a steath ninja, or even become a exorcist with Onmyou skill (Magic skill). It have buiding system that allow you level up your character and collect better weapons/armors to fight against stronger yokai (monster)
+ If you're Dark Soul player, i don't recommend you play this game because Dark Soul more better by any reason. Nioh just Soul-like game, it won't satisfy real hardcore Dark Soul player. But if you wanna try, then why not?
+ If you're not try hard player, or at least you don't want to get stress from this game, then i don't recommend you this game. It's easier Dark Soul but still hard for someone want to enjoy casual game.
+ If you're too lazy to research how to use keyboard/keyboard & mouse and don't want to take a long time to training then you mustn't buy this game, it will make you disappointed. Another way by using controller, it can help you solve this problem",1612899482,1624126698,True,1,0,0.497703969478607178,0,True,False,False

It's difficult to progress in this game when it's so easy to die. The developers test your might by giving you the option to fight a giant two-legged machete wielding horse demon in the beginning of the 1st mission. YOU WILL DIE. Just run away. Run away from anything other than soldiers and zombies. If you die within a mission, you have to retrieve your soul where you died. Otherwise, you lose all your exp and soul cores (demon souls you can summon as a battle action). Now imagine doing this over and over again because you died many times. So why do I still enjoy playing this game? I've never played a game before that had so many weapon types. Each weapon type has their own attack moves too. You like ax? The game has ax. What about giant scythe? It has giant scythe too. My personal favorite is the gauntlets. I enjoy using the dual swords too. In the beginning, you have the option to choose two weapon types out of the rest. I had thought I would be stuck with those weapons throughout the game. But the weapons you choose just dictates which of your player attributes gets a bonus point in the beginning. In this game, it doesn't matter how high of a level you are, YOU WILL STILL DIE EASILY. To fight in this game, you need ki. Ki is basically your stamina bar. I would highly suggest leveling up attributes that give you more ki. This is not a hack and slash game. Every move you make during a fight takes ki. Use your ki wisely. Otherwise, you'll be wondering why your attack button isn't working and then SLASH! An enemy just cut you down! This game has a lot of enemy loot drops. You can hold up to 600 items. So, choose what you decide to keep wisely. So far, I've been collecting as many cool weapons and armor I can possibly carry. Be aware that your equipment weight is only affected by what you are wearing. I had previously thought it was affected by my entire inventory and so I dumped a bunch of loot. That was early in the game so I didn't lose out on anything special. This game has a lot of attack variations (skill sets) that can be unlocked with skill points. However, if you want to expand your skill sets, you have to train at the dojo. I didn't know this and so I was just using BASIC ASS MOVES for so long. Training at the dojo is also how you unlock ""magic"" and ""ninja"" attack moves. There is a lot of cool things you can do in this game. It's too much for me to continue writing about. If you can just deal with dying so much, you will enjoy this game for the rest it has to offer. I do have one gripe about this game. The voice! Why allow me to change my character's voice in the character creation when SHE DOESN'T EVEN TALK THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE GAME. I just thought that was weird. Anyways, if you do buy this game have fun creating your character. It's the most enjoyable thing you can do before the game throws a GIANT HORSE DEMON to slaughter you!",1624012216,1624012216,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think it is objectively a bit harder as the combat system is quite a bit more complex than just managing a stamina bar or FP.  For example you have 3 stances that all affect your combat style (dps focused, blocking focused, dodging focused) plus a wide variety of special demon moves to use as well as different weapon builds and demon builds.  Its a lot, but it works so damn well. 

Edit: Maybe I purchased the game at a lucky time, but I have not had any of the technical issues people have listed in reviews.  0 crashes, high FPS outside of cut scenes, and no FPS spikes on max settings.  I have a 3070 which runs hot while playing, but never stutters.

Combat:
Nioh holds you much more accountable than dark souls as you have to actively retain stances to regenerate your stamina, and generally speaking enemy types feel much tankier even when using a strength build.  Overall though, once you get a feel regaining posture and using your demon counter to break the 0 stamina penalty state (which is far more punishing than anything in dark souls), the combat hits a level of satisfaction that I find to be far superior to dark souls.  

Other features:
Exploration is much more linear than souls games and you have to select a location through missions that can be replayed to grind for loot, but honestly its a nice change of pace. There is also more of a focus on optional grinding for gear and great black smithing option which appears to be far more complex than it really is.  

Final thoughts: 
While souls games begin to feel trivial after a handful of runs, Nioh feels like the next step of evolution for the skill based aspect of this genre.  I highly recommend to anyone who craves souls like action and wants to truly test themselves with a new system that is not only a mile wide, but also miles deeper than Fromsofts current offerings.  Fingers crossed Elden Ring can share some of this complexity!",1623967042,1623967124,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For new players - The learning curve can be a little steep at times but if you enjoy a challenge it is well worth the patience. Take the time to really understand combat mechanics of stance changing and Ki (stamina) management. Take the time to know your enemies, but most of all; 

DO NOT RUSH

This game is absolutely brilliant at punishing mistakes in a spit-second. 
Slow down, snipe off weaker enemies before a fight and be sure to make friends with ninjutsu and magic!

Pros:
-Literally the first game but with improvements such as having switching between two guardian spirits and having them equipped with different soul cores
-More enemies such as monkeys that have become violent yokai you'll learn to hate at times. one-eyed yokai with big feet that can kill you by hopping on you with their weapons like a pogo stick, monks that have turned into rats that would be a dream for a gross brand of furries, a horse and ox demon transplanted from Chinese mythology to Japanese mythology that would be a dream for a brand of furries, a mommy milker cat girl from Hell that'll appeal to weebs, and even a bigger mommy milker demon leader from hundreds of years before my character was born. All for me to fight or get killed by.
-Having your own hut. While it's just a menu, you can choose which guardian spirit you unlocked to act as your visitor and setting up your own tea shelf.
-Scampusses are adorable and cute

Cons:
-Game can have moments where enemies can end up being cheap in a fight
-Grinding for elixirs can be a pain if you haven't taken the time to build up your stash
-not enough options in customizing your own character. Need more hair options.

Nioh 2 hits it out of the park in most if not all aspects I find fun in a videogame.
- A story that is mainly based on Japanese history and puts that demon twist to things, if you know learnt Japanese history, this would strike you as pretty fascinating and helps provide even more context to what is happening around you. As for me, I didnt know jackshit, I had to read up the texts you get for characters, Yokais and other things and still found it fascinating. The worldbuilding is done by picking up glowing yellow balls that sometimes give context to the surrounding area and provide some ""ahh okay moments"" and even hints to whats gonna bone you. You're gonna have to read alot in this game in order to get a better understanding still.

- The combat is slow at first and demands a different skillset as to what we're used to in your usual Soulslike game. But, the farther long you go, the game gets even more fast pace as you learn more combos and meeting new enemies. The game demand you to play aggressive whilst also busting 180 360 degree moves that actually requires you to remember combos like a fighting game, this keeps you engage the whole way through. And cause of this, i never found the combat to ever be repetitive in anyway shape or form. As well as introducing a mechanic where you could sort of ""parry"" with your Counter and as well as youre able to go apeshit in the Yokai Shift Mode which is an event on its own.

- Character creation is amazing and i found to be very attached to my character the whole way through. And even though some of the people you meet can be a bit flat, they do enough to drive the narrative forward and especially your best friends you meet along the way. 

- Music is excellent and was able to make me emotional in the end and the enemy varieties are extraordinary, especially the Yokai designs. Those rightfully struck ""OH FUCK WHAT IS THAT"" to ""Omg that looks such a cool design."" And each Yokai was a blast to fight over and over again.
- Online feature is there like summoning a dude via bonefire or having an online session where you could play with friends with an adjusted level settings etc etc.

-The game doesnt go the extra mile for graphics, but i think thats on purpose. As most places are passable enough and some places are just so gorgeous to look at even it may not be Horizon or TLOU2 level, it gets the job done for maintaining a constant 60 FPS all the way through. Loadtimes arent too bad either.

In the end, Nioh 2 is one of the best games ive ever played, a game that demands your attention and should not be looked away. It is not required to play the previous Nioh game as Nioh 2 is a sort of prequel, present, sequel type of game. Its like watching Parts from Jojos, you dont need to watch previous Parts to understand, but having that extra context to things does wonders to elevate things, but this isnt so much in Nioh 2. This game, tested my patience, tested my mettle, tested my mental, and in the end, I was smilling the whole way through. I thought this game was too tough at first, but after putting enough hours into it, learning how to Ki Pulse, learning my combos, learning the movesets of mobs or bosses (souls style), this game without a doubt, earned my very high praises and Im willing to crown it as best Soulslike game ever.

While this game is a souls like, it is dramatically different from the actual souls games if that is what you are looking for. Nioh 2 is more like a modern Ninja Gaiden with souls-like influences. While combat and general gameplay variety is excellent, moment to moment experiences can be extremely fun or incredibly frustrating and tedious. Several mind boggling design decision hold this game back from being a ""perfect"" game in the genre. 

[h1][u]The Good[/u][/h1]
[list]

[*]Very fast paced smooth and addictive combat. Combos and button timing matter, depending on the weapon.

[*]A lot of variety in gear and character builds.

[*]A good character creator. This is a major improvement over Nioh 1 that didn't have one at all.

[*]Wide selection of enemy and boss variety.

[*]Great cosmetic customization through the ""refashion"" system. Similar to transmog from other games. Use what you want without the fear of looking ugly. (not unlocked until the second or third mission)
[/list]

[h1][u]The Mediocre[/u][/h1]
[list]

[*]You can respec your character whenever you want and even store several builds and sets to switch between, which is a great feature. But a respec has a very annoying cost of one book of reincarnation, which dramatically increases in cost every time you buy it, up to 1 million gold! If you enjoy swapping builds frequently on the fly i would recommend just making another character. Respeccing ends up being extremely costly in the long run. 

[*]The crafting system is functionally good, but is HEAVILY random. Say goodbye to all those rare materials you just used, here is a common white item in return. In addition to this brutal crafting RNG, crafting ends up being mostly useless once you reach NG+, but at least its moderately fun to use until then.

[*]The story is just there to move you along. Despite all the (skippable) cutscenes, the story just ends up feeling bland and nonsensical. Characters you don't fight against are largely forgettable. 
[/list]

[h1][u]The Bad[/u][/h1]
[list]

[*]Frequently reused environments and bosses. Despite the good boss variety, this makes them start to feel extremely samey.

[*]Boss fight RNG. While bosses randomly deciding what attack to use is nothing new, souls like game rely on you learning the bosses to beat them. In Nioh 2 bosses have RNG in their combo lengths, vulnerability windows, and reactive attacks. This leads to a lot of deaths just feeling frustrating and unfair.

[*]Uses the same ""sudden ambush"" tactics as the souls games to increase difficulty, but is much more brutal about it. The game even spawns enemies behind you during some fights with no kind of indication.

[*]The game world will establish rules and mechanics, then break those rules later to increase the sense of difficulty with no explanation of why it is working the way it is. The most frequent example of this is certain boss attacks having a more narrow iframe window, meaning fewer of your iframes are actually iframes. This encourages blocking, which takes away from your sense of play style.

[*]The game will sometimes punish good play. Just dodged a string of boss attacks after learning the boss in NG? Certain bosses have attacks they never use unless you dodged their last one, and will blind side you with a one shot attack. However this doesn't happen very often until NG+.

[*] General lack of information and translation errors. While there is a tip button that generally tells you what does what, in several instances the description is either vague or just downright incorrect. If something isn't functioning like it says it does, you might have to look it up or find it out through experimentation.

[*]Inconsistent game mechanics. For example: there are several items, skills and mechanics for recovering the resources you lose on death, but the game also kills you in more unfair ways than is usual in this genre. These items are a bandaid to make unfair deaths feel less frustrating. Why add so many unfair death mechanics and then add items that let you recover from them? This seems like a sign that the devs didn't know what they wanted their game to be so several mechanics seem at odds with each other.
