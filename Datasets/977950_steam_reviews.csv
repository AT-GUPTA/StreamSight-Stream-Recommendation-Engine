i enjoy this game a lot, but it's not for you if you're not willing to put in the work. 1 miss and it's over. however, you do have some tools to help you practice, so it's not playing a song from the start over and over, though it is still tedious. i have more than 2500 attempts in a single song and i'm at 40%, even though it's a hard song, you definitely need willpower to pass harder songs. easier songs are not as hard to sight read but after 20 hours or so you should be able to pass some harder maps, which require more memorisation. so that's the biggest issue with the game. if you're not up for it, i wouldn't recommend buying this game at all.

Because clearing the first level is an ordeal. Clearing every level is an ordeal. The game is unforgiving and requires actually keeping with the rhythm, with very limited cheesing possible. Being a musician, I've actually noticed my rhythm improve. 

Besides that, let's talk about the actual game - you have to hit any key (keyboard, controller, mouse, or whatever else you can connect to your computer) when the revolving ball (planet) goes over the track. It takes some getting used to in order to understand how to 'read' it, just like it takes time to learn how to read guitar tabs or sheet music. Until you get used to reading, you should rely much more heavily on your ears and listen to the beat especially in the earlier levels. This game really is unforgiving. And for me, that's an absolute plus. It takes me back to the days where you actually had to get good or master a level or game in order to beat it. The frustration and overcoming that is required makes the reward so worthwhile. 

Once you clear the main levels there is an entire deeper world of custom levels and its own community (mostly Koreans), so be sure to join the discord and visit the forums. The people who are really into this game are... well.. REALLY into this game. That's because it has near-infinite playability. It's unbelievably cheap to buy as well, so definitely give it a try, and try to clear at least the main levels before you judge how you feel about it. If you're having a lot of trouble, take a short break and come back to it. Just like when learning a piece of music on an instrument, your brain and muscle memory adapts to it after taking a rest or getting some sleep, and you're able to play it better the next day. If you're used to rhythm games, you're already aware of this and this game is a must-try. If you're new to rhythm games, then welcome and I hope you really enjoy it as much as so many others do.

Lastly, it's 5+ years in and the community is still active, and the developers are still adding and improving the game. That shows you the kind of passion and love that surrounds this awesome game.",1708679139,1708679139,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Coming from a Bemani/VSRG background, I mainly played games that boil down to the same thing -- hit the note when it reaches the bottom of the screen. After years of clearing even the highest level charts I lost the feeling of accomplishment and thought ""just another one off the checklist."" Trying other games helped a bit, but at the end of the day each one was a carbon copy of the one I played before.

ADOFAI is unlike any other rhythm game I have played and gives a great feeling of accomplishment after clearing each chart. Each chart feels like a work of art and the cinematics give a huge feeling of immersion.  Yes I do get very angry at this game sometimes, but after clearing each chart I am usually able to go back to it and clear it with minimum checkpoints and even rate changes at times.",1707961220,1708156788,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't see a point of not adding one you could still pass a song barely but have a terrible score then reward people with more points who miss no notes. It would make begginer players actually stay longer where it wouldn't effect good players as there scores would be much higher then the sloppy players but sloppy players could still feel like theyre progressing..

* Solid core gameplay
* 21 accessible standard levels (+9 additional official DLC levels)
* Easy-to-learn editor with high potential
* Workshop support for custom levels
* Frequent updates (bug fixes + editor features)
* balls
* 3 balls??????

Bad:
* As with all things workshop there is going to be an amount of low-effort content
* Does require a moderately powerful graphics card to run consistently at 60 fps on some levels (may be an issue for some people)
* One of the featured levels causes the game to eat 8 GB of ram (seriously? who thought that was a good idea)",1641091386,1707605548,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I may not play it too often but I like to come back to it for a few hours sometimes a whole day of playing at least once a month and remind myself why I love it so much

I'd definitely recommend the purchase including the dlc, Workshop levels are a whole nother level of incredible, what people have made with this game is really fun and amazing to play for most skill levels and are graphically and auditorially amazing. Especially ones like fragor magnus which are entirely produced as a project specifically for adofai with it and it's plot in mind.

TL;DR Buy the game if you want to try rythm games for the first time, or if you already like rythm games. It's really fun and ""Easy"" to learn (After what might be your first few hundered attempts just on the tutorials lol) also try out featured workshop levels",1657594199,1707429910,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

It gets far too fast for my brain to process at points and I just end up getting confused it's not nice. It's a good game, but the later levels especially have just a constant stream of fast inputs, which is what the game revolves around.

I wouldn't recommend this game to people who enjoyed games similar to Rhythm Doctor and think they might check A Dance of Fire and Ice out after that.

This game is kind of similar to geometry dash in that once you beat the main levels, you have two choices. You can either put the game down and be content with your experience and the time you put into it.
Or you can play custom levels and end up spending hundreds of hours playing progressively more difficult custom charts just to see how much you can improve and compete with others.

Just like geometry dash, the custom levels range from slow and easy charts that only really need one or two keys to clear, to levels that can require you to be able to press up to 16 keys on your keyboard simultaneously to pass certain sections or index past 500bpm with each hand. 
Sometimes this is done well and other times it's done horribly, but it's not much of an issue because there are a variety of user created levels for just about any skill range.
Custom charts have also increased in quality dramatically over the past year since I started playing both in terms of visual appeal and charting quality.

This is for sure my favorite rhythm game and is almost my most played game on steam now because it's just incredibly satisfying to play (especially if you have a clicky keyboard). Improving at custom charts and beating ones you once couldn't is also rewarding and improving my skill is the main reason I still play. Plus It's just cool to see songs I like charted to their fullest potential in this game.

WARNING: If you do get seriously into playing custom charts, it's going to take a toll on your keyboard once things escalate in difficulty. I've only had to buy a new keyboard once because of this but that's infinity times more than with any other game. Just be careful with your kb and try not to slam the keys.

All In all I hope both I and the game continue to improve over time and I hope to see new players giving it a try and putting their accomplishments out into the community.",1633291260,1705544911,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is absolutely amazing, the design is flushed out, completely bugless, no latency issues, and the charts (or maps) are stunning. Each map (or chart) is made with great care and storyboarding(background graphics) is absolutely beautiful and the best I have ever seen.
 

HOWEVER, the biggest problem I have with this game and hence this recommendation is the inability to continue if one note is missed. This gets especially frustrating on player-made charts (or maps) where the map (or chart) gimmicks catch you off-guard, forcing you to replay large sections of the chart (or map) - only to miss a note at the same exact place (then do that another 100 times). This absolutely kills the enjoyability and the artistry of the map (or chart) maker.


This post is going to fall on deaf ears as the ""haters gonna hate"" post on the player base and developer, but this a warning to all new players (or n00b players like me) looking to play this game.

This game is made by Ben Shapiro - facts don't care about your feelings.



Edit:
Great feedback keep them coming!

Edit 2:
Since then the developers have implemented the issues I mentioned above. Goes to show how much they care about the game.

A satisfying way to torture yourself while listening to music
Get it if you want to inflict pain, or if you're used to that anyways

The fun only starts after suffering at least 75 attempts each level.
It's very strict; one miss and it's over - has to be Perfect.
The Torture gets more intense as the spin patterns become increasingly complicated.

His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[8][9] In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time.[10] His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word Einstein broadly synonymous with genius.[11]",1704460146,1704460146,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you don't know if you want to buy it at least try the demo on itch.

This game is very punishing as one missed note will set you back to the nearest checkpoint (which there are few of), but for me that's part of what makes it fun. It reminds me of actually trying to play a song on an instrument where one wrong note sours the entire piece. The transitions between rhythms can get pretty difficult but that just how rhythm changes are a lot of the time when playing music too. You just have to get used to it.

Overall this game is pretty fun and you can challenge yourself as much as you want with the workshop, although a lot of the workshop levels aren't aligned to the music as well as the base levels (which alone are worth the price imo).",1703897620,1703993152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the deck, you'll be hitting pretty much the ABXY buttons.  On a PC, you can use any keys on your keyboard.  You can use one finger and hit any key on the Deck or the PC keyboard.  You can also use two fingers on one hand, or a finger on both hands, and hit any keys on your Deck or PC keyboard to play this.  Doesn't matter, so long as you hit some kind of key when you need to!  Such a good thing, especially when you hit the speed rounds.

What makes this game great is that it's a very primal rhythm games.  Graphics are very minimal when you compare it to other rhythm games.  But the music and the timings that you need to hit to complete each level are supremely good.  When you finish a round, you feel like you got better at rhythm.  A lot of rhythm games are casual, you just try to finish each level and just go yay, I did it.  This game, you feel like you climbed to the peak of a high mountain.  Such a rush!

Of all the rhythm games I played - and I buy all of them on Steam because there aren't many that come out each year - this one is to me, the best of the best.  If you play any type of musical instrument, or think you're pretty good at rhythm games - this is your jam.  You need this game in your life.  It'll exercise your brain where music is concerned.

The game has 6 main levels which I completed in one sitting, then I found it has 6 more levels after that.  Then there's all these other levels you can jump to, which are extras.  Man, this game is HUGE.  Lots of levels to play, and the music is all over the place, lots of genres.  I bought the DLC the same time I got this game, I and I am nowhere near ready to get to that portion.  The main game has a LOT of levels!

This is to me, world-class rhythm gaming.  You need this game if you love rhythm games.

Oh.  One more thing.  When I played the main game, the first six levels, I was like, this is nice.  Then you can play the speed rounds of each level.  The music gets faster, and the music pitch goes higher.  That's when I realized that the music in the main game is mostly slowed down.  If you want to hear the music playing at its normal pitch and tempo, you need to play the speed rounds.  I am so addicted to playing the faster rounds JUST to hear the music playing at the right pitch and speed.  Such a great incentive to keep playing!

There's an option to play practice levels of each round, where the music is slower and you can take your time to go over the difficult parts of each song.  But honestly, it's easier when you play the speed rounds.  At least for me.

Whatever you do, if you love rhythm games, this is the ultimate.  Get it, you will love it for sure!",1700791020,1703309202,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The base design of the game is quite elegant, and performs marvelously for the degree of precision it demands. Take heed; the difficulty of this game is no secret. For the novice rhythm gamer, it may become a frustrating exercise, and the uniqueness of the level design compared to other games in the genre can make it a challenge for more seasoned players as well. Yet, this difficulty is what makes successful level clears so extraordinarily rewarding.

Just looking at the base levels provided, there is an excellent selection of music available with well designed tutorials to get the player accustomed to the various level patterns. What truly opens the game up is the fairly expansive library of custom levels created by the community. There, one can find myriad levels ranging from simple to extraordinarily difficult, with gorgeous visuals enhancing the experience even further.

Base Game with base levels as well as Muse Dash Collab, Crown Islands and Neo Cosmos have been a blast. An interesting use of rhythm and melodies that mash together really well.

As a student who finished music school I notice how much effort went into creating different forms of rhythms and polyrhythms as well. Really really cool!

But here go my caveats, almost all of them include the workshop levels.
My main issue is that difficulty ratings don't matter at all, most notably harder ones like Lorelei I almost finished at 95% with a decently low amount of effort. Meanwhile the map named ""Cat Gif"" I couldn't pass for 3 months, just because the rhythms felt sporadic and really poorly placed in my opinion.

My most notable issue is ""Fast equals Hard"" and ""Can't see means hard"". I currently really hate this form of difficulty, as almost 40% or more maps I couldn't finish because they give me a headache and have too many effects to even see what's happening. Most of times I had to squint to even see what was happening and what patterns were coming up.

For ""Fast Equals Hard"", that limitation is mostly on the hardware side. I don't think fast equals hard in music, plus it only limits based on how much carpal tunnel you want to suffer with. Because for me it demolished my will to play the game and the ""Fast Equals Hard"" maps. Me finishing them didn't feel good, because I would be left with wrist pain the whole day and often times it's too fast for the type of melody.

That being said (woo that was a long one), I can still appreciate and see all the efforts and cool ideas coming into play as well as the minute details of genres and different musical numbers. Frums being an awesome one (as his songs really made me interested in the game), and the art styles are really cool to see. Almost every map I played had a different art style and set piece.

So for now I would really recommend anyone to play this game, but just know when going into workshop that most maps can be hell to play. And you'll have to poke around to find a needle in a haystack.
But when you do, it can be a really cool journey~",1701971622,1701971649,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you have a good sense of rhythm, you'll probably love this game. It's a simple yet challenging concept with lots and lots of depth built in to keep you busy for a long time, even when disregarding all current and future DLC and custom Workshop levels. However, if you have a notably poor sense of rhythm, anything past the opening hour or two will likely be torture. The game's slow opening may demonstrate to some that this game is a teaching tool of sorts; a way to learn various different rhythmic patterns with visualizations of them. [b] This is not the case. [/b] While the game can assist with learning rhythms, it WILL have you in over your head with rhythmic complexity if you can't process rhythms quickly and effectively enough, and given the strict no-mistakes gameplay format it can be difficult to get your bearings and continue onward after a death.
For how relatively low-cost the game is compared to other rhythm games on the market, I would recommend anyone picking it up, but if you struggle with learning rhythms and/or get angry at games very easily, you might want to skip this one.",1701635407,1701635407,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To me this game isn't grounded entirely in skill, but whether or not you can see through whatever's on the screen at any given time and it feels like there should be some degree of standard and quality control between members of the community, while I understand that is not the fault of the developers of the game directly they still actively promote this experience without giving people the option to fix it easily.

You always have business left to do whenever you come back, every time with a newfound goal of further achieving perfection or chasing a new skill. No matter how long ago you finished the canon story... and its DLC.

Fire and Ice has an excellent community and 7th Beat knows it. They go out of their way to have Featured Levels in-game, which is a collection of the most popular (and artist-approved) levels that were popular in the Steam Workshop. Absolute godlike feature.

Oh yeah that's right, Fire and Ice has a sandbox editor!

With that said, one nitpick I have with custom levels is the effects/filters. Eventually you may notice filters being used everywhere. It doesn't bother me, but the repetition does pull me out of immersion at times (the variety could improve in that department).

[h1]Good-ass game. Play it.[/h1]


It's basically a rhythm game that's [i]visualized[/i] in an organic tile pattern as all the levels boil down to a path you move through made out of these tiles, with your two ""orbs"" rotating around an axis and you having to press any button to the beat as they go over the next tile to [b]snap[/b] onto it.
It sounds stupidly simple as-is, but the trick is that the path twists and turns and THAT twisting of the path is what gives you an organic visual hint as to [i]what timing[/i] you're supposed to have on your button presses.

Curves might make you have to hit notes on a half-beat, or [i]wait[/i] an extra half beat, or put you into offbeats for a while entirely, or even triplets and other weird stuff on diagonal twists.

...And you're gonna need to get used to that because this game gets [b]jazzy[/b] and doesn't hesitate for a SECOND to hit you with the weirdest offbeats, syncopation, triplets, quintuplets, and fucked up time signatures straight from the pits of [i]hell[/i].
It gets annoying at points, sure, but it's annoying in a Rhythm Heaven way in that it's moreso a [i]cheeky[/i] way of catching you offguard if you're not expecting it. You get used to it quickly.

You die in one miss, mind you, ala Geometry Dash, but this game [I]does[/i] have the decency of having at least one or two checkpoints in longer levels which is GREATLY appreciated.


The ""base"" game is only about 6 levels [spoiler](plus the bonus level after 100%ing all of the previous ones)[/spoiler] but (unsure if it was all post-release updates) there's PLENTY of postgame content after you beat that. Extra ""speedup"" challenges get added to every level. A whole-ass set of 6 more levels unlocks. You get an extra section or three of guest song levels, including a couple of Muse Dash crossover tracks for some reason.
Plus the semi-recent DLC that adds even [i]more[/i] stuff on top. PLUS custom levels/workshop support.

There is [b]so much[/b] stuff to this game, especially with how cheap it is. Even moreso if you find it on sale.
I [i]love[/i] rhythm games like this, that focus more on having really simple gameplay and making the [b]timing[/b] of every hit matter, as opposed to showering you with note diarrhea on a track of like 9 different buttons and calling that ""difficulty"".

[b]Absolutely recommended.[/b]",1700378827,1700379138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hell, I'd say I don't speak for more than half the people on the planet Earth.

I purchased the game with the intention to use its level editor. I am a human being who thinks about level editors from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. I wanted to try this game due to the mounting number of levels I have seen from this game's level editor because of this.

My time with this game so far has been short, as you can plainly see. However, in those 26 minutes, I did not find myself enjoying this game what-so-ever. I wanted to enjoy the game (trust you-me), but I found myself unable to have fun with any of the game's content.

Firstly, whilst the level editor is available from the very beginning, much of its content is locked behind in-game progress. Now, I know for a fact I don't speak for everyone, but I will say that I personally unironically believe that there is a special place in hell reserved for people who lock level editor content behind game progress. I paid for the DLC on the pretence that I'd be able to use its content in the editor from the get-go; evidently not.

""So play the game then!""

I did.

I never got past the first world.

Say ""skill issue"", ""git gud"", etc. all you want; it won't change my mind. I hate how difficult this game is, because I was more motivated to get to the level editor content. I'd generously say that I spent the first 2 minutes of the game figuring everything out (I saw a lot of this game on Youtube so I already understood the basic premise), and I'd say I spent another 2 minutes on the levels of the first world before I got to the titular level ""A Dance of Fire and Ice"".

I grappled with it for 22 minutes and got 70ish% of the way through, and the only thing I felt was raw, unfiltered anger and disgust. I'd most closely describe it as the video game equivalent of being body-checked repeatedly by an overweight, oversized cut of raw chicken. Just anger, disgust, and general distaste. Not even anticipation or excitement for getting closer to the end, it was just an angry feeling. I felt throughout as though reaching the end of the level was not going to garner a reaction of ""Hurray! I did it"", but rather a reaction of ""Now give me my editor content f*ckface"".

Again, and I cannot stress this enough, I cannot speak for everyone. Not everyone is a creation-obsessed freak of nature like I am. But I got nothing out of this game except genuine vitriol. Buy only if you unironically enjoy Geometry Dash.

The minesweeper secret was more fun than the actual game content.

TL;DR: Buy if you like Geometry Dash. Game locks its level editor content behind its game content and I'm the only sick freak who cares.",1699940986,1699940986,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i mainly play rhythm games to the point where i can say I'm able to pick up a new one and get the basics down in a few hours to a week. usually, rhythm games allow you to make mistakes, all it does is just lower your score in the end, but for this, you cannot miss a note or you WILL fail.

it can get very tedious, playing the same song ever and over again, trying not to miss a note but reaching the end of a song feels very rewarding.

for variety, i'd say there's a good amount. first, it starts you off with a few beginner levels to get you started and then it slowly eases into more complex maps. after you finished all those, you can then decide to browse other maps to play.

its visuals and songs are top tier in my opinion and deserve recognition for each one.

I'd recommend this game mainly for those people who enjoy rhythm games and want to look for a new challenging one. but first, going online and playing the free version should be the first thing you do before buying the game. its not as action packed or filled with as much content, but it gives you a great idea on that to expect in the full game.

The premise of the game is exceptionally straightforward. You play as 2 orbiting planets where your objective is to align them with each tile in a chart in an orderly orbiting fashion from start to finish, to the rhythm of the music. While mistakes are allowed to be made, they are usually hard to recover from, and consecutive ones will result in a Game Over. Simple, yet challenging.

The game offers 12 base worlds, with additional, more difficult ones to unlock later by completing said worlds. Through the Steam Workshop, players can also play and share their very own user-made charts, with virtually any song to grasp, as long as they deem to be fit by the artist.
The charts that the player has to go through present different patterns such as long, triangular-shaped, overlapping zig-zag roads and otherworldly designs that the developers could think of. Throughout each world, the backdrop, visuals, and music change accordingly, making each course unique and varied.

My only complaint about this game sometimes is the way the practice system is handled. Practice allows you to replay specific sections of a chart at different speeds to help you understand the pattern, and this is great, but the problem is that it requires you to pass it *first* in order to do so, which defeats the whole purpose of practice. This results in a lot of unnecessary trial and error, which is quite infuriating at times, especially when the tiles start to overlap and get increasingly more difficult to read in the harder stages of the game.",1698873309,1698873309,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

That's all, thank you.",1698536987,1698536987,True,2,0,0.427973270416259766,0,True,False,False

Summary: Really fun game and worth the price. Can get a bit frustrating at some times, but really satisfying when you beat the levels. The gameplay is pretty easy to learn you just press a button to move, but you can take it to the extreme with extremely fast and precise gameplay. Took me about 10 hours to complete the main story mode (Levels 1-12). But the bonus level and speed levels are hard and will take you some times. Overall really recommend the game, you should pick it up if you like rhythm games.",1698179999,1698180373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The ability to create custom levels is probably the best addition to this game because it's basically [b][i]infinite replayability[/i][/b] and allows for amazing, creative levels to be made. It's also what keeps this game alive, which is how games like Geometry Dash and osu! survive.
For anyone scrolling through the reviews before buying, I highly recommend playing this game especially if you enjoy rhythm games like me. I also recommend playing 7th Beat Games' other game, Rhythm Doctor. It is amazing, and possibly even better than ADOFAI.

A Dance Of Fire And Ice (ADOFAI) is easy to learn but hard to master game. You can play with the mouse or the entire keyboard or both, there is no limit. The base 12 worlds are very begginer friendly and the bonus levels are hard and fun. The game also has a DLC which in my oppinion is worth buying.

  And I haven't gotten to the best part which is the community made levels. If you don't like the levels which the developers have made you can still find levels made by users. Did I mention YOU can make the levels? It's true! The editor is very simple and easy to understand but if you have trouble don't hesitate to look up tutorials.

  So in conclusion the game is simple but hard. It's main 12 levels are fun and the bonus levels are challenging and hard. If you think this game is right for you buy it!!! But if you think you can't handle the difficulty don't worry there's plenty of fish in the sea.",1697034956,1697034956,True,9,0,0.592908322811126709,0,True,False,False

I like how visual the rhythm is, with the tile's angles and different shapes, you can really understand it just by looking at the map, which is really refreshing-  most games like this get overly complicated, and you can't really tell with what part of the song the button is in sync with. I found it really refreshing for this not to be an issue in this game! 
The maps and songs are pretty cool as well, and I like that they make you practice the moves in small snippets before having to play for a whole song- each mechanism is thoroughly shown to you, which works in the game's advantage with how complicated it gets in the later stages, especially after you start playing around with community-built stages. Some of the names for the tutorial stages are pretty funny as well :] And of course, the training mode has proven to be really really useful, especially since it allows you to slow down the song in order to actually learn the song's rhythm instead of pushing buttons at random until you get it right.
Overall 100% would recommend, the only real flaw is the instant-kill which gets just a bit annoying when stuck on a section (although I can't blame the game for being difficult), and I've found it a bit difficult to switch to multi-button playing once the game requires you to up the speed- it would be a bit better if it got you used to playing with multiple buttons from the beginning. Other than that, really cool, both visually and soundwise, and super fun gameplay if you like a good challenge!",1696718122,1696718122,True,1,0,0.505494534969329834,0,True,False,False

rhythmic patterns being visualised as shapes is a unique enough concept on its own, but in gameplay it makes patterns unfathomably easy to read, and every new rhythm the game throws at you is a moment of ""of COURSE it works like that"" rather than ""ok, now i have to remember THIS stupid pattern""

there's plenty of content in the base game alone, and neo cosmos is a great little package on its own, despite feeling a lot like a spinoff game rather than a natural extension of the base game (which is a good thing!!!)

Playing the game by itself - Eh
It should be great if you are new to rhythm games, but those like me who try tens of rhythm games might learn too quickly, the extra islands can only stave off hunger for more levels for so long. the base levels teach you enough to get going on most easy maps, the only problem i see is that the music isnt to my taste most of the time (""It Go"" is awesome)

Playing online, you have access to tons of maps but because of the gameplay it falls into something that isnt quite spectacular--
Memorization! if you want to play anything much more difficult than the base game levels you will have to memorize a lot of the songs, all normal rhythm game songs like kobaryo, camellia, etc. will be too fast for normal play if you map it like other games, making it require memorization (luckily, there is a practice mode for this)

the gameplay, i really love it, you hit any button on your keyboard or mouse (within reason) and it will make the ball go to the next note! if you miss a note once then you die, if you hit too early then its fine as long as you hit at the right time when its time, luckily most maps in this game are synced pretty well if you go for the popular ones, or if you find one on youtube you like
if you get this game, make sure to sync properly to your headset, if you feel like the notes are appearing before the sound in your headphones then make sure to fix it",1694198368,1694198368,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I randomly bought this game today just because it looked like just another cool rhythm game, but it made me reconnect with my younger self in the sense of how hard I was trying. When I was younger I would be the kid sweating at everything he did, literally everything. I always asked the dumb questions just so I could really grasp what I was learning.

I have never tried harder at anything in the past 3 years than playing this game, sometimes I end up holding my breath when playing because Im on a streak. This game made me remember, its ok to be the one sweating at something that should be easy but is harder for you, its ok to be the one who asks the dumb questions just so he can understand the concept better, its ok to fail and fail and fail, because as long as you keep going no matter how long it takes you will reach your goal. Even if you get made fun of for being bad at something that everyone else is better than you at, as long as you put in 110% you will reach your goal and go farther than most.

I have only played this game for 2 hours, but it has made me realize so much about myself that I forgot.

Big ups to the devs for making such a wonderful game.",1693805711,1693805711,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Isn't it weird that as a musician, a drummer at that, I've rarely ever found interest in rhythm games?
The reason is that most commonly, music games are more about reaction time and button mashing rather that understanding and keeping the music and the rhythm.

This is different in ADoFaI, you have to rely on and train your rhythm skills.  You have to hit every beat in the level if you want to progress, which is hard if your rhythm isn't well trained, but that's what the game is for! You might actually get better as a musician if you play this game, since the music is visualised in tiles that are actually quite reminiscent of sheet music! Plus, it's a lot of fun (unlike sheet music lol)

The tutorials are really well designed, they teach you the basics song by song, and once you're done with the base game you can hop over and try your hand at the tough bonus levels and custom levels made by the community, some of which insanely difficult, but the addicting nature of the game makes me not want to stop trying!! Big recommendation by me!

Other people say that the game is too hard, with 6-X being the common reason why. That's just cause you're bad at the game or don't have enough patience to loose and start over. That's one of the main points of A Dance of Fire and Ice. It's supposed to make you fail, until you memorize it enough to pass. Another common denominator I saw was that people were complaining straightly about how garbage the game was, and how it was garbage. Now I can understand this, but not when they have literally like 0.2 hours of playtime. They probably didn't even reach world 2 before giving up and saying that this game was very bad. Another reason is that people say that you can get very angry at this game. I can understand this as well, since I also had times when I felt frustrated, but really, you just need to take a 5 minute break and do something else. If you can't do that, maybe rhythm games aren't for you, since most of them rely heavily on memory. I really love this game, and I even recommended this game to many of my friends who don't even enjoy the rhythm game genre, but they loved this as well, having dozens of hours on it.",1692941763,1692941763,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would only recommend it to people that won't smash their keyboard against their head 👍
Overall, very frustrating at times, but that makes it all the more rewarding to finally beat the level you're on.
Music is overall great, and my favorite part is probably the level editor. Even just making levels to play while I'm stuck on a main level is a blast!

I've spent around a month now and I've glad i'm saying, I've enjoyed it! As an experienced rhythm gamer, this game has this mechanic which no other rhythm game i've played of never has. Fail once and you restart! This is an addicting title that when you fail, you try and try again. This game is for everyone to try no matter your experience on rhythm gaming. I love that the game is still continuing to grow with updates! Songs, stages are really well made, although challenging it's still beatable and I've enjoyed the feeling when you win a stage :D

I'm still working on getting those last achievements. Keep it up! For those who want to buy it, BUY IT! For those doubting, I believe there's a website demo to try out! :D 

Update - 9/08/2023: couple of new levels has been added to add content which is cool!!!! challenging tho! c:

And then there are people who complain about how because when you miss a note you die instantly, it makes custom map excruciatingly frustrating. This is a lame excuse of a review, because every custom map is made and published to the creator's discretion, so you should be getting the experience that they intended, whether that be frustrating or not.

The campaign is well worth over the $5.99 USD that I spent, and player made levels should serve as icing on the cake for players who want to get really into pushing their limits, so I literally cannot sympathize with any of the negative reviews I've seen.",1689800165,1689800165,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

on a more serious note tho probably one of the most punishing but also most addicting rhythm games there is. the difficulty curve of a single mistake failing the entire song may sound scary but once you played enough to actually manage to play songs without mistakes this games becomes very addicting very quick, its DLC is also just amazing introducing actual characters into a rhythm game where you control 2 balls plus new features which custom map makers can use in their maps as well. overall one of the purchases i started regretting early on when i constantly failed all the time and now a purchase i'm so happy i made. 11/10 plus the soundtracks are amazing as well",1688230462,1689099234,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really enjoyed the vanilla beatmaps when I first stepfoot into ADOFAI, but the real learning curve for me came when I got into custom levels and boy it was a roller-coaster of a ride.

About the DLC, thought it was fun to play with new mechanics but I have mixed opinions about it, that's all I have to say for now. poof*",1687988683,1687988683,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The irony is that it might be the most simplistic rhythm game with you only needing one or two keys to beat the main levels the game has to offer. This is a game that isn't necessarily about reaction time like in most rhythm games but rather learning the often complex and varied rhythms that can be found in each level and the custom levels use this to create difficult levels with rhythms that become incredibly satisfying to master once you've learnt them. 

If you are limiting yourself to the main levels created for the game, you are missing out on a huge catalogue of incredible levels that really stretch the mechanics of this game to their limit. By allowing the player to use any key on the keyboard to the play the game, custom levels can utilise up to 8 button gameplay to really test the player's ability to play extremely fast and complex rhythms. Over 200 hours in, I have just started to get good at alternating with four keys and I know I can continue to push my skills as I have never felt like I hit a wall in this game unlike with other rhythm games. 

Overall if you enjoy rhythm games, the is an absolute must and I would highly recommend you explore what the community has created in this game, even if the steam workshop isn't always the most intuitive to browse.",1687970769,1687970769,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, the game is not perfect, but I do think its concept makes for the best rhythem gameplay when done right, and lately it's been done very right, by both the devs themselves and the comunity. The game allowes you to visualize different rhythms in a way that no other game does, and some songs really make that concept shine, especially those with polyrhythms, odd time signitures, or antrhing to do with the rhythm of the song. For that reason, I think that this game could be an excelent first rhythm game for anyone, despite its difficulty.

A Dance of Fire and Ice, henceforth referred to as ADOFAI, is a ""one-button"" rhythm game. You tap Space. (Or whatever else you want, all inputs are equivalent.) That's it. (OK there's *one* official level that does require 2 simultaneous inputs, but it's kind of a throwaway, so don't worry about it.)

But how it keeps itself from being boring, as I think you can tell, is by its unique visualization of rhythm. The time until the next note is dictated by rotational distance, rather than lateral distance. (It go spinny.) This is hard to get your head around, especially when one miss sends you right back to the beginning of the level (or checkpoint, for longer ones, *thankfully!*)

ADOFAI is a hard game. Rhythm gamers are certainly familiar with the feeling of trying to get a full combo or other precision-based achievement and walking an absolute razor's edge with their nerves near the end of a level, but then getting a RUSH once you finally manage it. ADOFAI distills that entire experience, frustration and elation alike, into its entire experience.

It's goddamn addicting.

The full setlist of this game isn't very long, not more than a half hour, but because of the high demand of the game, you can easily sink double-digit hours in before you've even unlocked the whole main game, not even counting the Crown Island or the excellent Neo Cosmos DLC. It's amazing how high the game can take its own skill ceiling for being a ""one-button"" game. Once you're on the back of its skill floor, it just keeps going up, it doesn't stop.

There is so much game here for so little coin, and it's made by developers who are veterans of the rhythm game scene and genuinely care about it. While some of the early tracks are a bit rough (albeit charming in their own right), the whole back half is banger after banger, and of course there's first-class mod support and its editor was just recently overhauled with new features so customs are about to start popping off yet again.

I can hardly recommend this game enough. You'll hate it, and then you'll love it, and then you'll hate it again. But it'll always be there, ready for you to take another stab at it.


....Also, seriously, buy Neo Cosmos. It's real good. Sef is cute.",1686330953,1686330953,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you miss a note late, you have to restart the entire song (some songs have checkpoints but most do not).  While the practice mode is a godsend and makes harder sections actually beatable, it is not fun to be 2 minutes into a song, miss a single note late by 1/8th a beat, then have to start the entire thing over again.  You can be early without instantly failing also, so it encourages you to not actually learn the hard parts, and instead just press the button at whatever the highest tempo part is at any given section to ensure that you pass it.

I highly recommend it for any rhythm game enjoyers and especially those who like rhythm heaven.

The stock levels are rising in difficulty for like 3-4 levels, then they just differentiate, but stay not too easy for you to keep your interest in. 
The practice mode is done perfectly, which is a rare occurence in this types of games. It allows you to not only choose the part you want to practice, but also TO CHANGE SPEED. AND THE SAMPLES STAY HIGH QUALITY!!!
Community maps while being rarely based on popular songs (at least for me), are all amazing and mostly challenging.

Probably not. But buckle up anyhow buttercup, because the Overseer of the Neo Cosmos is here to slap your ass.

This game is the embodiment of the phrase ""easy to learn, hard to master."" It's like being waterboarded by a rhythm game, but in a good way. 

You press one button, and that's it. The controls are as simple and easy as a drunken one-night stand with your ex - minimal effort, maximum regret, and questionable satisfaction.

The visuals are as minimalist as a vegan's grocery list, but with a soundtrack that'll make vibe like a 17th-century bard on speed. Your ears will be the main stars here, so make sure to have those bad boys primed and ready for action.

As you progress, the game will start to treat you like a rhythmically challenged chimp as your fingers stumble through the minefield of beats, but when you nail it, you'll feel like you just got extra credit on the chromosome test. 

Overall, A Dance of Fire and Ice is a gem. It'll remind you that life is an endless cycle of pain, joy, and funky beats. The game is a journey of musical masochism that's as enjoyable as it is brutal. You won't regret it.

In rhythm games, the way to create fluid gameplay is having patterns that players can sightread with their brain on autopilot, rather than having to overthink while playing. This game does the exact opposite of that; you have to consciously think about every single input, even when there are 5+ of them a second with brutally unforgiving timings. In some maps, the notes are almost entirely syncopated, making it even more difficult to sightread. Every level has about 7 tutorials ahead of it to teach you all the stupid patterns before throwing them at you 3 times faster all in a row and hoping you remember them, if that’s any indication of how unintuitive the gameplay is.

Additionally, sometimes all the different shaped patterns got so confusing that it was legitimately easier to play with my eyes closed than try to follow along with the visuals. You’ll often find 3 or 4 notes stacked on top of each other so that you basically just have to guess when to hit in order to syncopate the way the game wants you to.

The game will give you “hints” if you’re failing a lot—but the only two things it ever says to do are “practice” and “try using two hands,” which is pretty demeaning once you’re 40 hours into the game and it’s saying “oh, did you know that practicing will help you get better?” especially since the practice mode doesn’t even let you play past the farthest point you’ve gotten to in the level. Also, using two hands, which seems to be the meta for harder custom levels in this game, requires you to think even more about every single input you make. I finally managed to get the hang of it a little bit on the Final Hope speed trial (the very last one I did), but for new players, it’s not at all intuitive.

Oh, and on top of all that, you can’t miss A SINGLE NOTE or you fail.

In the 40 hours I played of this game, I did not ONCE feel like I was having fun, other than playing some of the “minigames” in T3-X, one of the DLC levels that has some actually creative applications of the game’s concept [spoiler]like shooting asteroids to the beat[/spoiler]. However, I think it’s pretty telling that the only time I ever had fun playing ADOFAI was on the level that least resembles ADOFAI. The DLC is also a little overpriced for offering just 5 maps (with a slight remixed version for 4 of them, but still) at almost the price of the full game.

Anyway, this is legitimately the worst experience I’ve ever had playing a videogame. I never plan to touch it again.",1680556035,1680556035,False,4,1,0.47653430700302124,0,True,False,False

as for the DLC, the main levels are fun, I had a lot of fun learning the new mechanics, however the EX worlds turned out to be much more difficult. which isn't that big of an problem, other than the occasional flood of emotions as you die right next to a checkpoint over and over again.

The Levels and Mechanics are very unique and honestly it's SUPER enjoyable if you enjoy Rythm Games. The DLC is also very cheap and worth it. I'd recommend going into the Game completely Blind.
For the People like me who wanted a Challenge, you can activate the (Perfect Only Mode) which makes the Game a little harder and beat most Levels like that.

- The continue in the main menu doesn't work, you just get softlocked there
- Practice mode doesn't work, it just restarts the level at the first checkpoint.
- Half of your click won't register
- Even if you save editor progress it won't save recent changes, and some changes flat out get corrupted.

How to fix these
- Make it so you don't get softlocked, simple
- Make it so it doesn't restart at first checkpoint
- Optimize the game. that is it
- Add an in game level saver similar to Geomentry Dash.

I might go back if you guys implement these changes but for now I'm done playing this game.

I have just finished the first half of the game and it took me ~262 attempts to finish the 6th song. I'm not too experienced with rhythm games (this is the 2nd I've ever played after Just Shapes and Beats), so it was probably harder for me than for players more experienced in this genre. However! This does NOT mean it is easy by any stretch; thankfully, there is a Practice mode where you can adjust the playback speed and the section of the level you are stuck on. Not only is the level design and gimmicks top-notch, but the music is addictive too.

Sure, you have classics like Osu! and Etterna, but the dynamic of ADOFAI is rather unique and interesting. I love this game for a couple reasons, you can see how the game grew as you play and how out of the ordinary the mechanics are is simply outstanding to me. Often times you'd think that following a pattern on a rhythm game would be pretty straight-forward for the most part but that is not the case with ADOFAI. I have had multiple instances where I had to attempt a pattern multiple times to even fathom what was happening, and I've played rhythm games pretty much my entire life. The DLC is really great too, the levels are fun, and the visuals are a step above from what previously seen on the base game.

This game gets a dragon rating of 1/10. A dragon appears on the screens in the background of level 12, but it's so insignificant that I forgot about it.

UPDATE: This game ACTUALLY gets a dragon rating of 9/10, because (and spoiler warning if you don't want to know), the newest final level, ""It Go"", concludes with a massive dragon being constructed and then subsequently blown up along with the rest of the level. Most of these points go toward the fact that I felt like a badass when I actually beat the level, it was a callback to the previously mentioned Level 12 dragon, and because dragons are just awesome in general, not gonna lie. My only complaints are that I blew it up and that its corpse sits at the end of the level, and I find that a little sad, even if it was only a robot and was also going to kill me.",1656546283,1675501755,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you play Geometry Dash and love rhythm games, absolutely try this out. The restart on each failed attempt should feel relatively normal and you already know the satisfaction that comes with completing a level after hundreds or even thousands of attempts. The skill ceiling is incredibly high as well, and the same kind of skill progression that can be felt in GD is present in this game.

If you don't play GD but are still an avid rhythm game enjoyer I'd recommend trying out the itch.io demo before picking it up. Keep in mind that although the gameplay is fundamentally the same the game has gotten countless updates since then and both looks and plays far better than it does on itch. If you like what you see then why not try it out, the price is more than reasonable.

I think the main pull of this game for me was just how intuitive it is. There is no ""how to play"" tutorial because you don't need one; anyone can look at this game and figure out exactly how it works. The music is incredible, the levels are filled with creativity and cool gameplay concepts, and the game does a great job of easing you into each new rhythmic pattern without holding your hand. The level editor allows for so much ingenuity that the greater community has built incredible levels, even forming teams to create mind-blowing stuff. Like I already said the skill ceiling is incredibly high and still increasing (if you want examples look up BWen, Jo Future, or Gamma Loop on youtube), and it really is amazing what top players can do.

Overall 11/10, could not recommend this game enough (If you like maybe look into Rhythm Doctor as well :D)",1674698914,1674704381,True,8,0,0.621547281742095947,0,True,False,False

Been playing osu since 2013 and honestly, this game is the fresh air I needed to get back that will and satisfaction of playing a rhythm game. If this game came out before osu or around that time I probably would have stuck with it for the majority of the time. The community levels are superb all with a unique storyboard and gimmics. The more you play the more you get used to the patterns and while there are many songs that you can't sightread entirely, the majority of the patterns you definitely can. You get used to the gimmics and all you have left is to get the speed to play them which comes with practice and playing.

Fantastic game and highly highly recommend getting if you're into rhythm games. Played a shit ton of other rhythm games and so far this is definitely in my top 3 best rhythm games of all time.",1593456402,1674428425,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sometimes the sound doesn't match what happens on the screen at all, to the point it is impossible to concentrate on the level.
Some songs feel like they've designed poorly just for the sake of making the game harder.
I know that can be a big part of any rhythm game but I don't really want to smash 10 buttons at once just because a song is high BPM. It drives me insane. I know it may sound goofy, but I literally cannot press 2 buttons at the same time. My brain cannot process that. It's so hard for me I just skip the levels that require that.
Also, repetition. SOOOOO much repetition for no reason. I get it, you want to test if I can to it twice or trice, but 8 times?? It's becoming boring at this point.
If you're new to rhythm games, I really don't recommend this game to you. It's too hard even on the early levels (""hard"" in relation to how much you played the game at that point)

I can honestly say that I was hooked from the first time I opened this game.  While ADOFAI is branded as a ""one button rhythm game"" the difficulty increases as you move on through the levels and gets pretty insane in Neo Cosmos as well (though you can still get by with two fingers).  The community levels also show how great the, well, community is, too.  

As for the gameplay itself, the way you play is by tapping rhythms in the form of tiles as two balls orbit each other travel with one stopping on a tile at a time as the other swings around to the front and each tap being a step on said tile that can make up shapes that correspond to anything from simple straight notes to rather complex rhythms.  This makes for an incredibly enjoyable experience, not to mention visually appealing making it unlike any other rhythm game that I can think of anyways.  ADOFAI is a strict game in the sense where if you miss a single tile you need to restart either from the beginning or a checkpoint (if there is one) with some fudge factors of early and late taps and the ability to overtap as well (but not too many time else you fail with this too).  
      >>There is also a practice mode where you select where in each song to start and end and to change the tempo by %.

While this can be seen as a hardcore rhythm game, it feels more of an experience that you can see quite explicitly how you grow as you play each level.  For example, even coming from years of Osu! and Muse Dash, it was fun yet pretty awkward to play at first, especially getting used to shapes for rhythms rather than something from any other rhythm games out there, but soon enough I was able to do quite well with the most difficult map I've completed being Meganeko - Moonlight Sonata 3rd Movement Remix (Mapped by Ssmille).

If anyone likes rhythm games, this is definitely one to pick up because it can become addictive pretty quickly, not to mention it almost feels underpriced with how much playtime you can get out of it!",1673564022,1673564605,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Half of the songs presented are either ass or too difficult to enjoy. 80% of your time on this game will be frustration to no end. The difficulty level of the songs in this is keyboard punching. Then after putting back the keys you had punched out you then realize that there was no checkpoint in the song or the last checkpoint was 5 sections ago. While I understand needing to make a game challenging to add to it's value. This game forgot when to stop when setting the challenge. Like a fat guy forgets to say stop when the waiter is shredding cheese on top of the spaghetti. While some of the songs slap, they soon don't when you're trying the same part of a level so many times that when you finally finish the song (or give up out of fear of having a heart attack) the attempts will be near the quadruple-digits. Overall it'd be a pretty fun game if they just toned it down on the ass-beating difficulty.

In my opinion, if you try a new level, unless you've already listened the song for at least a hundred hours, you're gonna get sh****d on by the game.
It's a good game, but only for tryhards. Because you're going to die. A lot. Also prepare to destroy your fingers, but that's the case in a lot of rhythm case, tbh.

The game's big concept is that you move along a path to rhythm of the music.  For the most part, this works as intended pretty well.

These are the parts that combine to a frustrating experience.
1.  You need to sight read the path to progress.
2.  You lose in a single mistake.
3.  The game actively messes with your ability to view the path, and your character.

When parts of the path overlap, it quickly becomes a major hassle to try and work out the rhythm, and on top of that, the game might do things like spin the camera, hide the path, change the upcoming path, zoom in/out, focus the camera in a specific spot instead of following, etc.

As a player, the solution is to follow the rhythm, but since you lose on a single failure, thats very difficult.  There is a practice mode, but it doesn't let you go more than a couple seconds further into a song that you've already reached normally.  When you get stuck at a certain part, you need to break out practice mode, then go back to main mode, hopefully beat it, and if you get stuck again, it's back to practice mode for a small section, and so on.  In the end, this is a secondary issue though.

At the core of my review, I get frustrated when the game wants me to enjoy it's fun path to rhythm gameplay, but then messes with the visuals so you can't really do that anymore.

EDIT:  I changed my review to positive, because despite the parts I don't like, and that I find them frustrating, I don't think it's fair to say it's not recommended.  In the end, it's a fun game, but not without negative aspects.",1672092089,1672807082,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Whenever you're playing a rhythm game, you usually will eventually run into a song where it introduces a new pattern in the middle of a song, and you will ultimately fail said pattern because you just have no clue how to approach it in the two seconds that it shows up on screen. This either results in you failing the song, having to restart the song and play it for two minutes, or you just barely scraping through, making you feel like you didn't really need to learn that pattern. Of course, you could go into practice mode and pick that segment, but that kicks you out of the flow state.

A Dance of Fire and Ice handles this differently: every world starts with introductory songs that are meant for solely learning new (or sometimes relearning old) patterns before giving you the actual challenge of the world. While the gameplay itself might feel harsh by ending the song immediately after one failure, you never feel overwhelmed by it, since you have just been taught how to handle the patterns. The game does not dwell on your failure, and you are quickly back at it again.

Another minor thing to praise about is that the game does not rely on visual trickery for its rhythm gameplay. Many modern rhythm games (especially the one-button kinds like Geometry Dash) like to make confusing visuals in order to make timings harder, which in my opinion takes the rhythm out of rhythm games. While the snaking pattern of the tiles might seem like it's designed to confuse you, you quickly understand the patterns of it and the snakiness becomes clarifying.

As for the songs, there's a neat selection of custom songs. My favorite one is this Katamari Damacy style upbeat, happy song (10-X), which just took the frustration away while failing over and over again.

Ultimately, it's a bit on the short end for the baselines, but for $5, you could do a whole lot worse. The Steam Workshop has plenty of custom maps for the game, so you won't run out of content.",1672492310,1672492310,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can predict the beat  asked (moment to press the button) by memorizating the distinct road patterns presented in the levels or by learning the melody, there is not audible cues as others rhythm games, the road is the preview of what is coming next.

For example, if the road is a straigh line you only press the button with the tempo of the song.  If you are entering from the top and the patter is a flipped ""C"" your beat must be slower; if it is a ""C"" you beat must be is faster. If you are entering this patterns from below, the rules invert.

Then you can get combinations like a ""S"" o flipped ""S"", or different rotations of an ""L"". Memorizce the type of beat requiered for each form, and when you see it, prepare for it and execute it according with the tempo of the song. 

If it is to much for you memorice, you can only use the rule ""if i go right i must go a little slower, if go left a little faster"".

The game could be more enjoyable if it was not requiered to not miss a single beat for hearing all the song. There is not an option to play the song entirely and see how good you did in the run. There is a practice option, but you can only practice until you reach highest progressión point in the song.

The quality of the songs is pretty good. It have a low price to try out.

I can't beat about half the levels, they're simply too fast. No difficulty settings and no way to slow a track down unless you've completed it before. Miss one beat and you lose, no checkpoints (I can think of one exception but even then it was near the start of the track).

That aside, very cool game. I like World 11, but it's just so long I can't keep replaying it to get the hang of every part. Giving up at 80%.

2022 UPD: I came back to this and discovered they'd made it somewhat more playable for noobs like me. You can now practice unfinished levels, though you can't practice parts of the track you've never reached, and can only go just a bit past the furthest tile you've made it to. They've also added an extra checkpoint on some hard tracks, which I definitely appreciate as it let me finally beat all the base 12 worlds. Outside of those, the game is still insanely hardcore and even the practice feature doesn't help. Oh well.",1593798335,1672253978,True,1,0,0.48748132586479187,0,True,False,False

1) To my geometry dash enthusiasts: Buy it now. 

2) To my Other Rhythm game players: You do have to restart after every mistake as in Geometry Dash, although it is very rewarding to complete a hard level after countless try's.  Not to mention, The songs are immaculate and the game play is very unique. You should try it out because its cheap. While there is no story and not a whole lot of original songs, there is a workshop, and all you have to do is find your song and play.
It definitely gives players the desire to play again after slamming their heads against a desks in pain and suffering. 

3)Non Rhythm game players: Its pretty much the start of playing a souls game if your running it on a potato. If you don't like Rhythm games don't buy this. If you want to try a rhythm game try geometry dash first. If you end up liking geometry dash,  go to 1.

A Dance of Fire and Ice is a good entry point for people who already play video games or have a background in music to dive into the world of rhythm gaming, but not one for absolute beginners. 

This game is fair both in how it teaches you to do the dance and its way of notating music. If you're no good at pattern recognition this game might help you to learn it because It's very unforgiving compared with other games of the genre. One major mistake - one dropped input and you're done with only the occasional checkpoint to keep the frustration from getting out of hand. The game is elegant in its simplicity but it gets hard pretty quickly.

Persevere though... clear the sixth, the twelfth and bonus world and you'll see just how shiny of a gem the game is. Then get the DLC because Neo Cosmos slaps and play customs.",1660665298,1669729791,True,2,0,0.550172984600067139,0,True,False,False

I feel like I am learning how to play the song rather than just getting through it. The practice menu helps a lot with mastering those difficult runs. There's a small base track selection, but that has been beefed up with colabs as well as the recent DLC. Once you are finish with that time to hit the community tracks, where we switch to tough but fair difficulty to just plain nonsense. Finally, it can run on fairly low hardware settings. If you like Rhythm games, this is an excellent addition to your roster.

Edit: I cannot recommend buying the DLC. The fun in rhythm games for me is in learning to play the beats correctly. The DLC leans heavily into making it more difficult to tell what you are supposed to play even is by either hiding the track entirely or deliberately arranging the notes to make it more difficult to see what is going on. It feels like I am trying to read sheet music with a 3 year old constantly tearing the page out from in front if me. I'm happy to learn to handle difficult patterns, I am not okay with being told to play patterns I am not allowed to see.

Almost every hard level has checkpoints in the level,
The game is cheap (even with the DLC),
Most levels have variation and aren't super long,
Most tutorials teach the mechanics of the level well enough.

It is easily worth the full price of $8.50 (AUD)
For new comers, there may be some cons as this isn't exactly a casual rhythm game. If you miss a note you fail the map and go back to either the start of your last checkpoint. You have to put in effort into learning this game and it's mechanics. 
If you are looking for a good challenge then I 100% recommend this game. It is very challenging but also rewarding, I have never felt happier then finally finishing a map I struggled on for awhile.
Easily one of my favourite games of all time. 10/10 Rubber Chickens.",1669023164,1669023164,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So many hours, and so many maps played, whether they're base game, DLC or community made. This is not the most intuitive for non musical folks, but to musicians, this is just rythym notation mixed with geometry. Truly a stellar game, with challenges, replayability, great progression, and smooth enough of a learning curve, you don't ever have to worry about never completing a level. This is the only rythym game I recommend to my musician friends, as opposed to osu! to my non inclined friends. Constant updates are great too, they do a really good job with moving really good community levels to featured, and one I know of is now a base game map!

A while ago, I got a video recommended by an ADOFAI player who progressed in one of the harder community made levels which catched my interest in playing this as well and it was worth it! 

If you're new to rythm based games and want to give this one a shot, you made a good choice, but gather some patience since gaming in this one needs a slight bit of patience and determination. If you're mad, you won't get prog done so easily.

The original levels included are fun and teach you the basics of the game. Some tracks weren't my favourite, genre wise, but those I liked were grinded out by a lot, even after I've completed them.

The best part in my opinion is the Steam Workshop feature. It's where I spend almost all the time if I boot up the game. People are putting a lot of work in it and the community is both helpful and motivated to bring their favourite songs into the workshop with interesting mechanics. It's a lot of fun finding new levels and challenges which show you how good you can get. Be careful though, the community levels can be pretty hard in the beginning.

People who have played for over a year can probably do songs like Kurokotei - Chronostasis which is a VERY hard song in my opinion, and I would not recommend that song for new people as it could make you rage as you don't know how to time those beats at the start. In my opinion, it is one of the best games which can help timing. Another thing which makes me say its one of the best is that you cannot get too many earlys in a timespan and not get a late [Making you lose] It is very complicated the further in [Number]-x as its meant to train you at the start, and see how that helps by making each one harder and harder, as i have only played for 31 hours, I am not as good as you think. What I don't like is that  Lenient mode doesn't help, just makes it more challenging for me, this isn't a bug though, its just something that happens on some occasions. You do not need to make any modifications to the game, I will maybe use Normal mode for most fast songs, as I like to challenge myself. By the way, if you read this until here, congrats! Now back to the review, my most favourite part of this game is that there is many different workshop levels to try out in Workshop>Featured, the featured levels are my favourite due to the challenging levels you can try out made by people like you, and they've made their levels so good they made it onto the featured. A suggestion I have is that you have more colours to select from, as the only colours are Red, Orange, Blue and Baby blue, I am not offended that there aren't many colours, I also like the fact that you can challenge yourself by setting Strict mode. If you are wanting to get this game but haven't seen the reviews, then I would say that it is a very good  overall ad would recommend this game. Thanks for reading this review, it's a very good game.

At first it might look or feel weird to play but then you should get the hang of it but could take you some time though. Then all the features it has to offer if you have somewhat gotten familiar with them the levels should get more easier but tougher at the same time cause every level introduces you to something new if not multiple thing you have learned combined in one. Also if you're struggling on a level you can practice the whole level without even playing it first then you can take on the level after, you can lower the speed of the level when you practice it to make it easier for you to play it and can skip parts of the level in practice mode so you can just skip to the part(s) that are the hardest for you and can go to them directly instead of playing the level again to just possibly die there definitely is a helpful feature that they have added. For the dedicated people that play this game with one finger or two are insane but if your wondering yes, you can use multiple fingers for this game.

First i would say that i love it and here is why:
1- The game is so polished to perfection and runs perfectly every step is so clean and it helps the player feel the rhythm and give me such a great immersive experience.
2 - The price for me it was 8.50AUD not on sale i have played it for 8.8 hours strait at this point that is less than a dollar an hour, amazing even if i where to stop now i feel i've had my moneys worth, especially considering i've paid more for DLC i never ended up using :(
3 - The music, ok so some of it i find a little meh, but some of it is great, even the ones that a meh are still enjoyable which i consider a big win.
4 - The level design, in all the mainline songs there is a little break down of paths you will be experiencing in the main song as well as a bit of an indication as to how it will sound,like an entrée. Fantastic idea, both exciting and informative.
5 - The community, it seems to me the story is a big tutorial for community levels, the difficulties range from 'Super Jedi God' to 'reasonably hard' and if you are lucky 'kinda relaxing' the not only is there massive scope for skill to develop but the creativity of many of the levels ""chefs' kiss"" they are so pretty and unusual its just great to see and it makes the level even more enjoyable on top of the already good music.
6 - The make your own level feature, i've only had a quick look at it but i found it surprisingly simple to understand and use, if there was a song i was desperate enough to play i could see myself making my own level for it, provided it couldn't find it anywhere else of course, just knowing that it is there and i could if i wanted to is a really nice feeling.
7 - The precision, it is possible that just getting to the end of the level may not be enough, for the perfectionist there is an option that will see you time every movement perfectly, its extremely satisfying and only made possible by how polished the game is. This offers an exciting 'easy to play, hard to master' dynamic that makes you want just one more round to see if you can get it this time.

Some things I wasn't a fan of - 
1 - I don't mind a convoluted path of progression, however, when the screen pulses to the beat it can be quite disconcerting, as well as a certain level having strait up jitter to deliberately throw you off which is diabolical and visual changes that are very jarring when trying to focus. i know there is a setting to minimise some of the flashing but it doesn't remove or reduce the aforementioned effects. Which is ok, its just frustrating.
2 - Is rage game, comes with rage. this isn't a surprise but its still, maybe play a calming simulator game after this

Some things i would love to see - 
1 - I WANNA DECORATE MY BALLS (i've been itching to say that), i want them custom and exciting some how more connected to me how i want them (lol). there is so much the colour of each of them, the trail, how it explodes.
2 - There is such a large focus on the level and everything that is going on is often very pretty i think it is a shame that there is not a way to save a run and watch it back without the overlays to just appreciate what you have just done and how it all looks. 

The developers have taken a simple concept and made it sparkle and standout though so much fine tuning and effort, and it comes though, like a soft inviting hand on the shoulder. I look forward to any further products and developments.

The unconventional format may throw newer players off, but the more you play, the more you start to recognize common structures, and the better you get at reading levels. (It also helps to know the song for some user-made levels.) For more unconventional rhythms, you may need to work out some math to figure out what the rhythm sounds like. Nothing too advanced, though, just comparing angle measures. The progression of the main levels is pretty good, with slower songs and simple rhythms for beginners ranging to super-hard bonus levels with super fast tempos and even quintuplets. (For those who don't know what quintuplets are, it's a sequence of five notes that together have the same value of four of the same note. You basically never see them in written music.)

[strike]9/10 a tad short still great[/strike]
Been a few years and 222 hours of playtime. This game has become my go-to rhythm game.
The only issue with the game on release was the length. They have since expanded the game by leaps and bounds, and it just keeps getting better. More creative. More entertaining.

10/10 solidified my love for rhythm games

COOL STUFF LIKE BALLS GOING IN CIRCLES. 

SOME COLLABS LIKE MUSE DASH, RHYTHM JOURNEY, AND PROJECT ARRHYTHMIA. IF YOU BEAT A CERTAIN LEVEL YOU GET THE FUNNY LITTLE EMOJI BALLS. 

COOL AF WORKSHOP TOO, A BUNCH OF THINGS THAT CAN GIVE YOU SEIZURES (IN A GOOD WAY).

NEO COSMOS DLC IS PHENOMENAL, ABSOLUTE ART, AND ADDED EXTRA CHALLENGES.

in all seriousness this game is really fuckin amazing, it may look simple but your wrong. the workshop has many things that would basically change your mind, the community is creative and make many ways to make levels look cool, crazy, wacky, silly, a living hell, seizures, emotional, the list goes on. the DLC adds some new mechanics and songs with an added visual novel short but sweet. i really hope to see some of you guys try this game out, we could always have more people enjoying this game.

For being a rhythm game, the music wasn't really that good imo. For what I played, I think there was only one track that I liked (3-X The Wind-Up). Maybe the later levels have good music, but 6-X really burned me out and idk when I'll come back to this game.

Yes, the game is quite hard (especially if you're new to rhythm games) but something in this game made me want to keep playing it again and again, even after failing 200 times in a single level. This game is truly a rhythm game, with each world having a different rhythm that you have to pay attention to. There's a good amount of content in the base game, especially now with the Neo Cosmos DLC. And, the custom songs are extremely easy to install, with them being in the Steam Workshop.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

The way it represents music in geometry is impressive and hard to wrap your mind around at first, but each group of levels slowly teaches you each new pattern until you're forced to put it all together in one final test. This way, very few things in the longer levels felt unfair -- I had seen them before, and knew I knew how to do them, it was just executing them all in a row. 
Additionally, I appreciated how it simplified rhythm games down to one button. I love a lot of rhythm games, but this is one I could give to my younger siblings to play, and they had just as much fun as I did. I'm not saying the game is easy : Its not. I'm saying that its very simple and that the complexity comes from advanced rhythms, level design, and precision. 
Last, I just wanted to say that the music is really nice and that I really appreciate how much the part mirrored in the rhythm you actually play is emphasized so much. It makes it a lot easier to figure out what you should be playing, and then connect the visual pattern you're seeing to a sound, which allows you to then remember the patterns for later and sightread things more confidently.

Gameplay is downright simple on the surface:
1) memorize the song
2) tap out the rhythm (any key(s) will do)

GOOD: The balls-bouncing-on-a-track mechanic illustrates syncopated and off-beat rhythms better than a typical falling-notes mechanic does (although I dislike how the VFX occasionally makes learning new songs harder than it needs to be)

BAD: But like any rhythm game, learning songs does boil down to practice and memorization, making any VFX and slick visuals a moot point.  You'll make it through the first handful of levels fairly quickly, but then your progress will slow.

In short, it's a fun rhythm game, good for casual players and with lots of user-created content for the more serious players.",1658368448,1658368536,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While easy to pick up, this game is very difficult to master. The game also contains several gameplay mechanics so that once a map is mastered, you can always challenge yourself more on it. On top of that, ADOFAI also features custom maps that anyone can create and upload to the Steam Workshop. In the end, this is a very good game that I would recommend to anyone that is a fan of rhythm games.

-Easy to pickup, hard to master

(i should probably make a slightly more helpful review, shouldn't i)

it's a very nice rhythm game!!!! i thought it was too strict for me at some point, but then i realized i was playing with Only Perfects Mode enabled for a , majority of my time, not realizing that it actually made the game [i]harder[/i], and didnt only recolor tiles based on whether i hit them early-perfect or late-perfect. but!!! despite my struggle, it's one of my favorite rhythm games

i just think that rhythm games with minimal input are really neat, the way they are strictly rhythm focused, rather than making sure that you hit the right button as well!!",1628883903,1657410206,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

The mechanics of the game are really simple and I find that this makes it possible to really follow the rhythms of a song without having to be an absolute beast since it is the only thing you have to focus on. 
It kind of feels like learning a song for some percussive instrument, but it's your fingers on your keyboard instead and the game takes care of yelling at you if you get it wrong instead of a teacher :D",1657409656,1657409656,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It certainly takes some time to adjust to the way rhythm is visualized here but once you do, it becomes an enjoyable game with plenty of obstacles to overcome.

I discovered this game by chance and decided to give it a shot (definitely try the free version they link to!) and I'm really glad I did cuz it is so much fun. Also, this isn't relevant to the game itself, but for me was a definitive bonus: you can get trans- and enby-coloured balls using special codes! 

My one and only complaint is that practise mode doesn't allow you to go any further than 10 notes or so past where you made it, which can get frustrating if you just want to get an idea of the song all the way through or even just complete a full section nice and slow.

You also have options such as speed trial to try and beat levels in a speed at which you like which I think is really nice.

Great game, wish it had more official levels. I blazed through them in about 5 hours, and levels created by the community are either bad, or too difficult for me. Music is an absolute bop. Would recommend.
