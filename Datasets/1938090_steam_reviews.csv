--------
It's abysmal to think that the issue on launch date has not been resolved. Although the game play optimization is more focused on graphics and realism instead of game play it runs poorly even after months of updates etc. The game when launched hits with a launch screeching noise and refuse to launch, instead freezing and a pop up screen appears saying it couldn't run. Skipping the launch video would probably fix it like cs did but no options are available for that. Many fixes and weeks goes by nothing works. Every tutorial that promises to fix it wouldn't work, reinstalling it doesn't work. The game was able to run with little issues except for crashes here there and then but this is unacceptable and for me a huge disappointment to even consider giving this game a second chance buying skins and let alone buy the game back again.",1666967180,1708853529,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cod is fun but until Activision fixes the ""your profile was signed out"" bug the game is almost unplayable. I've lost countless rounds of zombies, including normal and elder sigils. When it happens in ranked or multiplayer you get a ban. Either make it so we can reconnect or fix the issue because its making me want to quit the game. Activision is a big company ffs, they have to have teams dedicated to patching and fixing bugs. 

[b] -- edit -- [/b]

I did a little research before posting my review and saw that its server issues. Basically it kicks people off when they get over stressed. Having constant server issues while being a multi-million dollar company is kind of ridiculous.

Good old CoD!


[h1] Missed opportunities. Disappointment for long-time fans. [/h1]


[b]Campaign, multiplayer and coop special operations feel like an excuse, a mediocre prelude to the certainly successful upcoming Warzone II Battle Royale. Disappointing for fans of a good CoD solo campaign, fast gun n run close quarter action in classical multiplayer and those that search excellence in zombie coop. [/b]

Before jumping into details, I would like to underline that the review is based on my experience of 10 hours multiplayer beta and early access campaign. I play CoD games since decades and defended each new title against review bombing back in the days and before they have been taking down from Steam. I am quite good in multiplayer and spend hundreds of hours overall in all different CoD titles. CoD is my favourite games series, the franchise I spend most of my gaming time in. Before MWII came out I replayed at least 4 different CoD campaigns and I am still a regular Vanguard multiplayer player and Battle-Pass buyer. The only mode I didn’t play a lot recently is Warzone. All of this to underline my authority when it comes to judge the quality of a new CoD campaign, multiplayer and coop modes. And yes, I am also grateful to Activision to be back on Steam!

Additionally, I am sure that the technical issues will mostly be solved in the coming weeks and new modes, maps etc will be added. However, we can only judge what we see for now. Keep this in mind.

[b] Campaign [/b]

The campaign is not meeting my expectations and it is a low point in the overall series. First of all, the Mexican Cartel mix with Middle-Eastern terrorists’ storyline does not convince. Whereby it starts decently good, with great directed cut-scenes, with a fantastically good-looking Amsterdam map, the story is falling apart the further you progress. Cabron, Hermano, well my Spanish isn’t up to date, but it feels cringe. In the end the fun you will have in a campaign of CoD does not really depend on the story, but much more on the gameplay and it is here where MWII disappoints. The magic of each CoD was always to let you get in the so called “FPS-trance state”, where shooting through the levels just feels so smooth and improving your skills through the levels. This state does not exist in MWII. Here it is all about stealth, driving missions and drone protection missions; so all missions that are far away from the action fireworks of old titles. Recently I played CoD MW1 remastered which is an excellent example of this action fireworks. The driving mission in the desert in MWII is one of the worst missions I have ever played. You see, each CoD in recent years had a major military idea behind it, from nuclear weapons, non-proliferation over terrorist groups, Middle-Eastern dictators, Emerging Disruptive Technologies (EDTs) (Advanced Warfare), private military contractors or the real spaceship battles (Infinite Warfare). Where does MWII sees itself? Realistic, more open world maybe, status quo warfare, a bit more special operations probably. Warfare on Drugs… overall disappointing.

[b] Multiplayer[/b]

In my humble opinion this is the heart of each new CoD. The fast gun n run action, close quarter maps, fast respawn and satisfying level-up mechanics. That’s the reason I play CoD over Battlefield since years. That’s the reason why I buy a new CoD each year. I really enjoyed the move from DLCs to Battle Pass seasons – this was smart. I still play Vanguard with a Battle Pass I paid 10 EUR for when I missed to profit entirely from coins in one season. So you see I am all-in and I can spend hours and hours playing the very same maps over and over again, just to see myself as the winner after each map.

What is wrong with the Multiplayer in CoD MWII? Not so much, however one issue could be the game changer in the end. The maps. The maps feel badly designed and sometimes way too big. Taken from the Invasion big maps – so called Battlefield mode. Also, sometimes you have the impression the maps are just part of the next Warzone II world map. This feels lazy. I mean even the latest maps in Vanguard were excellent in design and replayability. WWII maps were fantastic as well. How come that Activision lost the focus in MWII for regular, classical CoD maps? The answer is probably Warzone II, the mode that is not available at  the time of writing this review. Warzone II will most probably be the heart of MWII and it is now more than clear that Activision tries to capitalize the most on it. Classical multiplayer however falls victim to this and I can promise you this will cost Activision in the end a huge player base – especially on consoles –, of gamers that love to play a quick round only, that like to level up their skills by fast gameplay. 

Multiplayer might be okay and especially the Amsterdam Hotel map is fantastic. However, it is not living up to my high expectations and it adds to my overall disappointment. Probably the Battle Pass will give the multiplayer new incentives to play, new maps will come in the future and also the match making, the stability, the performance will improve until then it is fun to play but definitely not better than previous multiplayer modes. And yes, I will play it more.

[b] Coop [/b]

And now the biggest let down and which I already expected to be the weakest part of the game, since Activision was not very outspoken on this part before release.

Instead of giving us a new zombie mode or extinction mode (you remember CoD Ghosts?) we should be happy about coop special operations. You see I am one of those people wasting hundreds of hours on coop modes, horde modes and those sometimes also just solo. I love the craziness of Black Ops Zombie puzzles and easter eggs. And seeing the watch time of some zombie youtubers, I am sure I am not alone. 

CoD MWII follows here the idea of the coop special operations of MWI with the difference that this mode has at the moment huge technical issues, especially in matchmaking, that it lacks the possibility to play solo and the worst I had to map my key-binds again for every single of the three maps. 

The maps of these special operations feel like they are taken directly from the upcoming Warzone II. The enemies look much the same all over the maps. To make it short, trying all three new maps, I simply didn’t have fun.

Will it get better over time? Possible. But it won’t be a real zombie mode. I am hoping however that Activision sees this and will deliver in the next years some decent zombie mode on top of the game. As I understood Activision wants to let MWII run for two years anyways. This should be enough time for adding Extinction or Zombies.

[b] Conclusion [/b]

You see, I am a huge CoD fan and I love playing every single one of them. Each new CoD has always been one of my most anticipated video games over years. Warzone II will arrive soon and I am sure that it will live up to the expectations of Warzone I gamers worldwide. If you are not looking for Warzone but for all the modes described above, then CoD MWII is at the moment not a recommendation. I continue to play the multiplayer and will retry my luck with coop special operations, but the disappointment will stay. After reflecting thoroughly, I am unfortunately down-voting this one for now. I am more than happy to come back and upvote the game the moment I feel that it now lives up to my expectations. I thank Activision to bring the game back on Steam. Please continue to release future CoD on Steam, even if the reviews are sometimes harsh and unsubstantiated (@Microsoft).

Not to mention how many hackers are in the lobbies now a days. Banning when cheating doesn't really work and those players continue playing. The graphical issues get worse every update such issues being the game screen flickering, crashing unprovoked (Just sitting in a party with friends), the shaders never end up loading after these huge updates.

I advise buying something else, Tbh use that 60 bucks for either a new game or Wingstop seriously.

Think you can overcome the matchmaking to even the playing field via a vpn, nuh uhhh, that goes against their terms of service and you will get permanently banned from previous, present, and future activision games.

Can reach higher places than other COD games would let you. No slide cancel is a shame but balances it more. Warzone seems alright. DMZ has a few bug such as items despawning or falling through the map after a few seconds.Campaign is an issue. Ive tried fixing a bug about the lights by uninstalling and reinstalling. Watched YT vids to help and restarting shaders isnt working for me. The lights through walls bug is very annoying. Otherwise campaign is fun.4.5 star rating (lol)

-A dozen game modes that fit most playing styles 
-Lots of weapons to choose from
-Quickly join a lobby/decent-sized player base
-Can choose to stay with a lobby of players you find (doesn't always work)
Cons:
-It got even WORSE. Lose frames constantly, graphics not loading even on ""extreme"", stuttering and lag with -25 ping. What an absolute mess..
-The menus are absolute trash. Restarts multiple times, then reloads, then needs to restart again, find what you want, then lags and misclicks.. it's a ball ache
-There is SO much useless crap jammed into this game, it runs like an obese muppet
-With the MW3 cash grab coming out, the amount of cheaters has skyrocketed..it's insane how many there are now
-Way too many attachments with minimal/useless/illogical effects on weapons
-POS crashes more than Hellen Keller in an F1 race
-Glitchy to the point of unplayable at times
-Can be laggy even with a good internet connection
-The ""updates"" don't fix anything, just seem to be a way to pump more $hitty ""features"" in
-No way to go offline so your activity is always shown
-Cringe events, i.e. bunny heads, celeb skins, etc. makes it feel more like Fortnite than COD
-gmod functions better than this game
-I bought the Battlefield pack because of how terrible this game is.. BF is no treat sometimes, but hey, at least it functions and runs better than this dog water dumpster fire

-Update 23-FEB-24: STILL the buggiest game I've ever played.. crashes at least once a session, every time has been right in the middle of a match; extremely frustrating. Every update makes more bugs. I keep waiting for the game to improve, but it never will. If you haven't bought it yet, don't.

At least the PC version is nothing but a pathetic cash grab. The game is clearly designed to give casuals on console their successful moments to motivate them for microtransactions. MnK is heavily disadvantaged to a point where the dumbest bots can be good on controller because of aim assist and the strongly encouraged camping. 

The [b] story [/b] is garbage. Im pissed about how the characters are handled without ever having played the original and giving a shit about them in the first place. The areas you play in consist of stitched together Warzone assets, the writing is embarrassing.

SBMM and the combination of forced crossplay and aim assist overpowered enough to even give toddlers their moments of success ruin an otherwise promising [b] PvP [/b]. TTK a little too high and hit registration a little to inconsistent. Many maps encourage sitting on some roof with a sniper all day. The 24/7 playlists with smaller maps are fun, the rest is filled with campers and people who play the same meta for months because developers dont bother fixing the balance. MCW and the riot shield backpack are part of every lobby. 

[b] Zombies [/b] is the laziest game design there has ever been. Exact copy of the Warzone map, some contracts and zombies thrown on it and that is it. I played with the thought of doing the full camo grind for once, but one match of this was boring enough. 

[b] Warzone [/b] - also ruled by aim assist - gives people so many reasons to camp that you will always get punished for actually playing the game instead of hiding in or on one of the thousand buildings. Fighting is just a game of hide and seek and the controller clown sitting in the corner already in ADS will usually win. Playing offensively is pretty much always a disadvantage. Aim assist effectively killed this game for PC and somehow there are still some delusional clowns left saying it isnt a legal aimbot.

However, the only things that I can name as ""problems"" in this game are easily fixable. It's just a matter of if the devs want to change it. Unfortunate as that may seem, I've not seen another game that doesn't fall victim to the same problems.
- BR problems with stacking, makes it impossible to win a fight if not hugging another player
- Store being a daily/weekly updated source of cosmetics, essentially a never-ending cesspool of worthless & mainly unattractive ""DLC"" that doesn't impact anything
-Lack of complete satisfaction when winning BR, completing anything mastery related in MP, or overall anything at all
- New Maps not being focused on the 3-Lane Dynamic

Now, with those problems stated, I must restate, these are problems found in every other AAA game out right now with an active fanbase. Not that every problem applies to every game, but that they may only be partially present in a game while still affecting it.

All in all though, after 330 hours, I can say it definitely is competing for playtime alongside other popular titles right now, and it isn't for nothing. The gameplay feels a LOT cleaner in this new installment, however that obviously shouldn't be everything you seek out in a game. For me, the grinds it offers have been enticing, and I appreciate the satisfaction I have after completing said task and receiving said reward.
A nice grab if on sale maybe, but I don't see a complete problem with standing price for what's received.

They're asking $100+ for this mess? How are Activision still in business? They're literally the video game developer equivalent to the Nigerian Prince Email Scam. Hackers? Check. Bugs? Check. Crashes? Check. Expensive? Check. Broken? Check. Woke? Check. 
Day One: Garry's Incident doesn't seem like such a trainwreck anymore... 

The only good thing this basket case game has going for it... are the current Cryptid skins and items. But good luck getting those when you're stuck at Level 1 for the rest of your life and none of the challenges update. They better give me all these items for free once the event ends or i'm gonna chargeback hard. I also bought the VAULT edition... and the Battle Pass is inaccessible to me. AAAAA title at work. Skull & Bones has some competition for GOTY. 

I love how it takes 1 hour to set the game up. You gotta watch the opening cutscene and credits, agree to 9 different terms and conditions, make a Call of Doody account, run pre-shaders, cycle through all the settings in the world, agree to not be mean to other players(seriously), and then you're finally able to play. 

And forget about navigating the menus... it looks like the UI was designed by a sadistic troll. You'll spend a good 10 minutes trying to figure out how to simply quit the game. Lucky for you, sometimes the game will crash and will come up with a big button that says QUIT TO DESKTOP. Putting you out of your misery... least they do one thing right.

If any company deserves to go out of business... it's Activision. Unfortunately the COD fans are akin to the in-game zombies; relentless, strong in numbers, and come back for each and every game. I am simply blown away by how terrible this game is. And it's not even Early Access. I've played Unity games, that have 1 hour of work put into them, that are more well made and less buggy than this one. ALL the positive reviews here are either trolls or bots. Which mirrors the in-game player base. 

mInOt MyEr! MiNoT hAwThOrNe! Get used to these errors... they'll plague you worse than the zombies will. Imagine being a AAAAAAAAAAA company, with years of experience, and you cannot even release a game that functions. Even IGN gave this a bad review... and there's not even that much water! If I told my wife how much I spent on this game... she'd probably divorce me and take everything... except my copy of this game. Thankfully though, according to Ubisoft, I don't own this game. 

I've been a gamer for a few years now... and I think it's finally time to retire. Please cryogenically freeze me and thaw me out when Acitivision manage to release a game on par with Black Ops 2.... or they go out of business. Whichever comes first.

Rating: ★★★★★

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (MW3) is the gripping conclusion to the iconic trilogy, delivering an adrenaline-fueled gaming experience that solidifies its place in the pantheon of first-person shooters.  MW3 continues the saga of the Modern Warfare series with relentless action, intense multiplayer battles, and a gripping narrative that keeps players on the edge of their seats.

Set in a world on the brink of global conflict, MW3 plunges players into a high-stakes battle against the forces of darkness. As a member of an elite multinational task force, players must navigate through a series of heart-pounding missions across diverse locations, from the streets of New York City to the war-torn landscapes of Europe and beyond. The campaign is a rollercoaster ride of epic proportions, featuring intense firefights, jaw-dropping set pieces, and unforgettable moments that leave a lasting impact.

MW3 excels not only in its single-player campaign but also in its multiplayer component, which remains a cornerstone of the franchise. With a wealth of customizable loadouts, diverse maps, and a robust progression system, the multiplayer experience is as addictive as ever. Whether you're engaging in frenetic close-quarters combat in Team Deathmatch or coordinating tactical strikes in Search and Destroy, MW3 offers a variety of game modes to suit every playstyle.

One of the standout features of MW3's multiplayer is the introduction of Killstreaks, which reward players for stringing together consecutive kills with powerful bonuses such as airstrikes, UAVs, and attack helicopters. Mastering the Killstreak system adds an extra layer of strategy to matches, encouraging players to adopt different tactics and playstyles to achieve victory.

Visually, MW3 is a feast for the eyes, with stunning graphics that push the boundaries of what is possible on current-generation hardware. From the intricately detailed environments to the lifelike character models, every aspect of the game is meticulously crafted to immerse players in the gritty realism of modern warfare.

In addition to its stellar single-player campaign and addictive multiplayer modes, MW3 also offers a robust Spec Ops mode, which allows players to tackle a series of challenging cooperative missions either solo or with a friend. Whether you're infiltrating enemy strongholds, defusing bombs, or escorting VIPs to safety, Spec Ops offers a wealth of replay value and keeps players coming back for more.

In conclusion, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a tour de force of the first-person shooter genre, delivering pulse-pounding action, gripping storytelling, and addictive multiplayer gameplay in equal measure. With its epic campaign, robust multiplayer modes, and engaging cooperative missions, MW3 is a must-play title for fans of the series and newcomers alike. Strap in, lock and load, and prepare for an unforgettable gaming experience.

(Season 1)
Attachments show up under their codenames in the files
Certain attatchments don't work properly (EX: They float, don't provide said stat buffs, or don't unlock even if you own them)
Attachments yet to be put in game show but aren't equiptable
Camo's show up using their template texture
You meet requirements to unlock the weapon but said weapon doesn't unlock
Characters faces unload just to leave floating eyes/mouth/hair
The zombies map had multiple spots where collision doesn't match & there is a specific spot where the map just lets you drive through it (Near legacy's fortress)
Attachments don't do as said
Packet loss/bust almost 24/7
Constant signing out mid match (zombies&multiplayer) where you don't keep exp/camo/unlocks/ect earned
Micro-transactions for cosmetics and those of which are earned through battle-pass/gifts are honestly ugly or nothing special 
Certain challenges work but others have trouble tracking completion ergo missing limited timed challenge windows
Certain characters are missing voice lines (EX: Alex extracting from zombies)
Trees have collision for players but not vehicles (Zombies)
In zombies if you bring a gun that's a blueprint it wont bring the full attachment listed
Some achievements wont unlock even when requirements are met
In private servers you can lose connections to the host as the host
Loading the firing range takes forever even if you have loaded it previously 
The collisions on vehicles is much bigger then it should be, causing certain cars to get stuck where they shouldn't
You can run over merc's yet you will still be shot at by them
The can kill the driver of the knights armored truck and it will still drive as if nothing happened
While changing attatchment's on guns OR switching operator's it will boot you back to the menu

(Season 2)
Everything from SE1 besides the map error in zombies
Zombies, a game mode with up to 32 players and a max party size of 6 will only allow you to launch with 3 people
Packet bursting is even worse somehow
Guns take minuets to load in during custom/zombies/multi even if you have loaded them in before
Spawning into zombies will sometimes not bring your gun then say you lost it, now putting you on a 1-3 hour wait time depending on the insured slot
(Friends issue) Random people can pick up your encrypted ciphered documents meaning you have to do a whole other game to get them
Custom games wont load custom game classes and requires a full file inspection

Sadly Activision has said they have given up on this game. It had so much potential to be really good but like most triple A studios we get left with a unfinished game.

Caleb's trajectory into criminality was deeply influenced by ""No Russian,"" from the original MW2, compelling him to mirror its violence in allegiance to a local violent street gang. His subsequent crimes against his family earned him a five-year prison sentence, where he managed to rehabilitate, leaving drugs behind and embracing his love of God. However, his release coincided with the release of the rebooted Modern Warfare II, reigniting his obsession with its world, especially the character Makarov. This obsession quickly derailed his recovery, pulling him back into gang life and substance abuse when he found himself unable to join the Taliban. Sadly, this led Caleb to another violent altercation where he beat up his mother, resulting in his return to jail.

I love being 'Shadowbanned' 3 times for just playing the game, don't bother buying this on PC as console kids cant handle it and just mass report you for using your arms.

Apparently, its a great decision to give the COD community a ban button, if a clan decides they don't want to play against you, they'll just report mass you for 'Cheating' 10 times. Currently facing a 30 day text ban (I don't type in game) and every time you're placed 'Under Review', you're put into lobbies exclusively with 'Under Review' players, which pairs you with actual Aimbotters/Wallhackers, and limit you to TDM/Dom only for 7-15 days whilst their automatic review process does its thing.

This has happened 3 times to me, recently released from the 'Under Review' process on Thursday 27th Jul after 7 days, played for 5 days, mass reported, and now back not being able to play the fucking game for another 7 days as of 2nd Aug.

Not cheating, not exploiting, not being abusive, just unfairly taken out of the game for being an above average player. Support does not help with this process, so if you're targeted for this, good luck enjoying your £70 purchase.

Is it a good game when you can ACTUALLY play? - Yes, one of the best CoD's I've enjoyed.

Is it worth it having to not play at your full potential because the community will just ban you over and over again? - F*** No. Fix the damn 'Anti-Cheat', whoever cooked this up needs to look at how its affecting the PC community and stop looking at how good their numbers are, 90% of the people placed under review are average players. You get accused of having RADAR HACKS FOR HAVING A UAV. Absolute travesty of a system and a community with the brain power of a fucking cabbage.

LET PC PLAYERS TURN OFF CROSSPLAY

Seriously, it's like they have a 'copy-paste' button for their game development. You know you're in for a treat when you buy the latest edition and it feels like you're just playing a glorified DLC for the last one.
And let's talk about the storyline - or lack thereof. It's like they hired a bunch of monkeys to throw darts at a board filled with generic military clichés. 'Oh look, another gruff soldier saving the world from evil, how original.'
And multiplayer? Don't get me started. It's like a breeding ground for twelve-year-olds who think they're hot stuff because they can quickscope. Congratulations, Timmy, you can press two buttons in quick succession. Maybe one day you'll learn how to tie your own shoelaces.
But hey, at least they've mastered the art of microtransactions. Because nothing says 'fun' like paying real money for a digital skin that nobody will ever see because you'll be too busy getting wrecked by some dude who's been playing since he was in diapers.
So in conclusion, Call of Duty: the game that's about as fresh as month-old bread and about as satisfying as a broken controller. But hey, at least it's good for one thing - reminding us that sometimes, mediocrity sells.",1708626942,1708626942,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

    Gameplay is very smooth, especially the animations, great graphics and very optimized. Multiplayer feels like the good old CoD series in a way, the campaign's twist and turns are a bit confusing and the whole plot is a bit vague, but I like how flexible and open the campaign and the zombies mode are, and the greatest strength of this game is the variety of the weapons and the freedom to modify them to your liking and play-style. 

    The price could be lowered a little bit as it is pricey for many people who want to experience it, and it is sometimes a bit hard to connect to the servers. In conclusion, I am completely satisfied with the game and it has improved in different aspects whether it be subtle or obvious, compared to its predecessors.",1708601711,1708602805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really liked the single player part of the game because it looked awesome and had a real nice story. It only was too short in my opinion.
In the beginning the multiplayer part was actually pretty nice with some modes that i did not really like but also some that i really did like.

But then the games changed and it started to show all these things that you really had to buy in order to be up to date with the latest game modes and advance to next made up nonsense.
It is one of the most childish games ever for woke people who cannot decide wether they should wear a camo suit or a green bikini string to a war field.
When playing this game online you get spammed over and over on what kind of stickers, pink ribbons and other weird stuff you should get in order to be ""cool"" or ""though"".
In game buying is the overall concept of this product and they will do everything to squeeze the last money you have out of you because ""Hey!, you cannot leave out on all the new fancy colored stickers and stuff"" which absolutely does not contribute to gameplay in any way.

[b]Edit:[/b]
Ban was lifted 5 days later..

------------------------

[b]Ranked:[/b]

1. Barely any weapons to play with, only 1 assault rifle..

2. Huge server issues, the player with lower ping almost always win the fight.

3. Crossplay can't be turned off if you're on PC. So you play against console players with built-in aimbot. 

4. People exploiting to use attachments that are not for the specific weapon. 

5. No servers in the north.

[b]Ranked Conclusion: [/b]
If you want to play ranked and reach iridescent, don't play on PC, don't live in the north, exploit the soft aimbot by spamming ADS with your controller and use cheesy mechanics like bunny hopping with high movement weapons while your built-in aimbot does the rest.

The graphics and movements are almost indistinguishable from the previous installment, and compared to the remastered predecessor, the emphasis on story has significantly diminished. The vibrant direction and profound, majestic storytelling that left a lasting impression have strangely become more impoverished with each new release.

Oddly enough, despite purchasing the latest installment, it feels as if you have to run the previous game to make it function. The structure seems to resemble downloadable content (DLC) in terms of content quantity, yet it comes with a new numbering and the price tag of a new game, inevitably leading to substantial dissatisfaction. On a positive note, the game introduces a focus on multiplayer with Warzone, DMZ, zombies, and war modes, featuring new weapons and various events, demonstrating ongoing management efforts.

The Multiplayer is even worse in my opinion Skill Based Match Making (SBMM) is an inconsistent system that one game will put you in the easiest game you have ever played then the next game your getting spawn camped for 20 Min by the most optimised and meta weapons that people are abusing. 

The main thing is that you cannot turn off cross play on the PC version of the game. On the console versions of the game you can turn off cross-play so you only play with people on controller. So if you play on PC without a controller you have to deal with people on open mike blowing out your ear drums and you have to deal with how strong aim assist is. 

Aim assist in this COD is the strongest i have ever seen it, people using controllers can jump around and do crazy movement and because they are strafing the aim assist is stronger and keeps their cross hair on you.
Not to mention that because you can't turn off cross play you have to deal with People Ximming ( Ximming is a cheap device that can be bought at Walmart that allows people on console use a Mouse and Keyboard as well and keep aim assist) this gives the person using it a huge advantage because not only do you get to have the precise and fast aim of M&K but they also get the major tracking that MW3 aim assist gives.

The info above from the lacking content of the campaign, the slow and repetitive zombies that can only really be done with a full squad of 4-6 people, and the Multiplayer full of hackers and cheaters makes for in my Opinion the WORST Call Of Duty of all time.",1708485085,1708485085,False,2,0,0,2,True,False,False

Unfortunately, Skill Based Match Making will dominate your online experience. You will have an overall average experience no matter what you do. Part of that means after having a few good games and a few average games, you will have to play in games filled to the brim with players who are far FAR better than you could every hope to be, due to having flee like reactions, godlike aim, and cheetah like movement, or worse yet are just plain cheating (Which is now proven to be actually common, this is not sour grapes. The worst thing that happens to these players is a 7 day shadow ban, which is always overturned after 7 days. In which time they use an alternative account) 

If that's not enough, you will be actively nerfed or buffed mid game based on your current performance. Your Health, your hit box and hit registration are all actively modified mid game. 

Stay clear of this until SBMM is removed (which unfortunately will never happen) unless you want a completely artificial experience. If you want to guarantee yourself a few good games, buy a weapon from the cash store and use it, you will shred all before you for a little while (Although I genuinely would recommend NOBODY buy anything from the store, if you feel like this is just a sour review hating on this franchise for no good reason then I dare you to try it and see for yourself what happens).

Score: 8/10
Pros:  Gunplay is incredibly solid and tons of playstyles and equipment are considered and then optimized. Its one of the first CoD I can honestly say nail the gameplay in years, perhaps since the original MW2. I personally enjoy the unlock system where you have to level up all the weapons individual to get parts that then are shared with weapons of similar types. This means that by leveling up guns you don't like, you can take parts you did like from them and attach it to your favorite weapons. This encourages variation and experimentation, where you may accidentally find a new gun you like cause you wanted more parts for your old best. DMZ is absolutely a blast and is the right balance of losing and winning. Unlike Tarkov where losing is incredibly frustrating, DMZ just makes you go meh when you die, as getting back to where you were isn't long tedious grind, and the balance between having everything and not isn't too extreme. Very well done. 
Cons: For the love of god fix the constant crash to desktop. This should have been resolved before release, to the point where the game should have been delayed. This CoD is so good that having it crash is such a heart wrenching experience because you get so into the game. The amount of times my crew rage quit because we were having so much fun only to hit that CtD wall is absurd. This is probably the best CoD in a while, fix this and you can easily get folks endlessly playing.
Recommend to: People who like CoD, who want a good FPS, and want to be surprised that somehow CoD managed to become great again.
Overall: Seriously Devs, well done. This is truly the best CoD in a long time. Fix the CtD already though, or explain details so folks can at least be content that you are looking into it.",1667344161,1708472862,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ended up getting a few updates here and there, game launches now but occasionally crashes upon booting during the Loading EULA screen. Each time it crashes it downloads content, but it just takes a long time for this content to download, not sure what it is. Anyway, game is in semi-playable shape when the content does install, however, I've gone through this about 4 times alread. :/

The first and most important thing to remember is that practice makes perfect. Don't be discouraged if you don't do well at first. Keep playing and you'll get better over time.

2. Learn the Maps
Knowing the maps is essential to success in Call of Duty. Take the time to explore each map and learn the layout, including key locations and choke-points.

3. Choose the Right Loadout
Your loadout is your set of weapons, equipment, and perks. Experiment with different loadouts to find one that suits your playstyle. Try different combinations of weapons and attachments to see what works best for you.

4. Use Cover
One of the keys to survival in Call of Duty is to use cover effectively. Don't just run out into the open; instead, use walls, buildings, and other objects to take cover and avoid enemy fire.

5. Communicate with Your Teammates
Call of Duty is a team game, and communication is key to success. Use your microphone to talk to your teammates and coordinate your actions. Call out enemy positions and share information about the map.

6. Stay Calm
Finally, it's important to stay calm and focused during gameplay. Don't get frustrated if you die or make a mistake. Take a deep breath, learn from your mistakes, and keep playing.

Сначала давайте поговорим о сюжете, если его можно так назвать. История кажется скомканной и лишенной какого-либо смысла, персонажи невнятны и малоинтересны, а сюжетные повороты больше напоминают сюжет среднего боевика, чем настоящий эпический рассказ. Вам придется просто мчаться по уровням, убивая врагов, не задавая вопросов и не задумываясь над тем, почему вы это делаете.
Мультиплеер - еще одна главная проблема. Это просто бесконечное плясание на клавишах и стрельба наугад. Никакой стратегии, никакой тактики - только хаос. При этом баланс персонажей и оружия оставляет желать лучшего, и вы постоянно будете умирать от невидимых снайперов и гранат, которые кажется, прилетают со всех сторон.
Графика, конечно, приличная, но это не спасает ситуацию. В мире современных видеоигр, где есть настоящие шедевры, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 кажется устаревшей и неинтересной.
В итоге, это пример того, как игры могут быть лишены души и ограничиваться только визуальным блеском. Если вы ищете глубокий сюжет, интересный мультиплеер и умопомрачительные геймплейные моменты, вам, скорее всего, придется искать что-то другое, потому что этой игре это просто не присуще.",1667443653,1708401402,False,3,0,0.566929101943969727,0,True,False,False

I Changed my Review from a NO to a YES

UPDATED REVIEW 2.17.24 with More ACTUAL GAME PLAY

I was Refused a refund and honestly I'm kinda happy Steam did because after a couple of good games of Zombies it really changed my mind and it may not be as broken as I thought. Zombies is a fun but challenging if your new and don't know any of the controls or anything.It DEFINITELY needs another mode or a limit of how many times you get disconnected you loose your loot. (for example if you get disconnected two times you won't loose your loot but the third time you would or even you can get disconnect once every 2-3 hours would be another nice touch if they did it.) I would Recommend People to pick this up on Sale at the state its in. I would still say the full price wasn't worth it but like i said in the OG review LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE.



ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS WITH 4-5 hours of So Called Gameplay 

DO NOT BUY THIS STEAMING HOT GARBAGE!!!!!!! I WAS A FOOL!!!! I gave it a chance figured WHY NOT? I even payed the $70 Just to try out the Zombie's as rick grimes and believe me it wasn't worth it my 5 hours of gameplay in realty was more like an hour of constant lag and getting kicked for some reason when i'd pick a weapon from my locker which was Rick's Revolver for Zombies I never Spawned in with it and when I Did finally get a good game it was with higher leveled Experienced Players and I was constantly down and had no clue where to go or what to do. I did get rare loot and legendary loot and dark either loot but I used it all in a game I tried tonight and Sadly I GOT SIGNED OUT!!!!!!!! I LOST ALL THE LOOT IN a MATTER OF not even 5 Minutes........ I EVEN Asked STEAM for a refund so that I may buy this at discounted price just so that MAYBE if this game is fixed I'll come back to play or try to play it again to RAGE QUIT. Just please I don't leave many reviews on Steam BUT PLEASE TRUST ME THIS GAME IS THE DRIZZLING S**TS!!!!!!",1707964971,1708384348,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, then MW2 released. NO idea what happened to Infinity Ward it was the worst COD game to ever release, and all my friends quit, but I still continued to play. WE want to play COD and not military recruitment simulator / Arma. MW3 is pretty much the same but just fixing everything Infinity Ward completely destroyed. 

1 Year of a bad game wouldn't be that bad, right? Well... It gets much worse if you play on PC and you are an above average player since MW2 / WZ2 NO idea who did it at this point if Infinity Ward or Activision because they aren't even trying to fix it if you get just ONE kill in Warzone ""2"" (yes this actually used to be named Warzone 2 if you are new) and if you have very bad luck and the player who you killed is a loser that can't accept that you are better he will spam report you and you will get instantly kicked to the lobby and secretly shadowbanned with a message saying ""Disconnected from server / Player kicked.""

(shadowbans take mostly 5 days to disappear for me and i got another one multiple times the same hour i was unshadowbanned in one Warzone game)

The chance is much higher for this to happen to you if you get high kill games and play resurgence because you can kill the one guy who keeps spam reporting you multiple times and i got my account shadowbanned like this probably 50 times and in MW2 somehow shadowbanned 3 times when i was already shadowbanned. (please explain how that works lmao just proves how stupid this system is)

Also in MW2, you could actually play Warzone if you were shadowbanned it would just take longer to find a game but in MW3 you can't even find a game even if you let it search for hours that means you pay 70 / 100€ to not be able to play the game for 75% of the year.

Activision lied during MW2 that reporting / spam reporting does NOT cause shadowbans and now recently also lied about how SBMM works.

Then every couple of games you give me a pity round where I can do really well because you make me one of the best in the lobby. The pattern is noticeable and predictable. It's bad. It feels like shit. It's why your playerbase is dwindling. 

Fix your cheating issue. You seem extremely concerned with the competitive experience since you have level 99 SBMM enabled, but you won't take the necessary measures to meaningfully battle cheaters. Implement kernel-level anti-cheat, and take aggressive steps to combat the use of cronus-like devices. 

When you pair your implementation of SBMM with your cheating issue you have a toxic combination that sours my experience every time I log in. 

You also dropped content update support for DMZ which was the only mode that kept me around during MW2.

Then I started getting put into lobbies where at least one player in every match can make impossible shots over and over. The problem is this: They could be cheating, or they could just be using a controller. You just have to remember that you're playing call of duty. The community hasn't changed from whenever you stopped playing last. I will literally miss some shots through walls on purpose just to not get reported and shadow-banned into another sweat lobby. I don't talk so I won't get reported for unkind words or whatever it's called (and I've still been chat banned twice, lol). Still gonna play though, maybe just less. Hopefully they balance controller auto aim a bit and tweak with anti-cheat. Right now it feels like it's all working against someone who just has decent aim on a PC.

- Disgustingly overpriced micro-transactions (which at this point are just transactions).
- The ugliest, most brain dead UI ever seen in all of video games. 
- The after action report that you can't even get all the way through before the next match starts, and then are unable to go back and check because it doesn't save or even show you what you unlocked. So if you miss that screen, good luck finding whatever useless attachment you just got.
- The battle pass that requires a crazy amount of time to complete for casuals or any sane person.
- COD HQ being the only way to access the other CODs feels shady. They want to waste your time so you eventually cough up the money for their yearly ""Most advanced COD ever!! :-D""
- SBMM making you sweat every game and focus all of your brain power just to get through a match. They claim it will encourage players to get better and play longer but I feel the opposite. I'd rather play other games after 2 or 3 matches.

It's clear that the game is designed to keep you on the application for as long as possible, and rope you into spending more money. The sluggish slides and screens and prompts are all intentional to keep your play hours up. You wanna go back and play MW2?? Yeah, have fun waiting 15 minutes for the application to restart 3 times and go through each shitty screen to get into a match. What's unfortunate is that this will never change because they know people will play and cough up their rent money/parent's money anyways. The glory days of COD are gone, unfortunately, and I don't ever see them returning. This used to be my favorite game, but this franchise has lost it's identity and it's very sad to see.

I understand all of the issues people have with this game and how daunting all the issues are. Whenever I get on games i play to be competitive and hope others will do the same, MW2 and III being two of the only games that allows me to do that. I also understand the issues with the weapon leveling system and the store, but have not found any issues dealing with the ""p2w"" ideas, i pay for these things because my time on games are slowly dwindling with studies and an assortment of other things, and most of the people who pay for the broken items can be eliminated with weapons that were previously good and still decent, paired with playing smarter than other people and not rushing spawns with no regard as i see in my games. (I also payed for the vault edition for those wondering) 

Final verdict: I love the game! despite all of the issues with Activision and its developers, to me, the game is a fast paced, high octane, competitive, slighly buggy mess that wants to be the best it can. Play with caution, as you may be called slurs in vc ;)

It feels like you're driving a tank with no tracks. The movement is slow, its clunky, everything about it feels either too bright or too blocky. The movement really is bad, prone feels like you're first person in mud runners, crawling through glue. The aiming is overly friendly which takes away skills.

The kills feel unsatisfying, there's very little bullet drop so it just feels too easy. You can really pick out enemies as it seems they made it to make everyone stick out like a sore thumb unless you buy the full black skins in the shop.

The vehicles are a mess, you can touch a box and a tank will fly up in the air, I never knew cardboard could be so strong! The smaller vehicles feel like you're in a pinball machine with the same control as you have when you're falling down the stairs. You take a lifetime to get to speed and you take another 2 life times to slow down or turn. Heaven forbid you want to do both, thats when things go very wrong.

I know you can technically unlock by finding them in zombies but I'm not wasting 40 minutes of my life playing that half baked crap for the chance to find what I want.  

Ranked play is in my opinion a better objective mode than regular multiplayer but the gun selection and customization is too limited for me.  I get the point is to not get op but the only novelty I find in this game is trying out different gun styles.  And you can't tell me the devs couldn't just balance the dps of different weapons to be more fair. 

Zombies as stated is a disappointment.  I would be able to tolerate it if there wasn't a time limit, as well as the stupid insured weapon crap (Honestly activision can it just be possible to try and enjoy your game?).

Fun game, just absolutely not worth 70 bucks. Zombies is kinda a sell if you dont like the open world zone clearing aspect. The campaign wasnt horrible just short if you bee lined it to the objective each time without exploring the entirety of the map, and multiplayer can be cancer if you dont play hardcore because some guns dont function as they should. Which is why i recommend hardcore, and i know some people are going to whine but guess what at least it only takes one bullet to kill someone instead of 17 where you only hit 3 shots by the time they kill you. Suck it up buttercup play the game and adapt to how to enjoy it, or dont play it at all, you see the mixed reviews it aint for everyone.

BUT!!! And this is a big But. I’ve always loved the Campaigns. They are everything you need and want out of a single player story driven action packed campaign. 

Everyone is complaining about the mission structure in MW3. The open missions in particular. But I’ve actually  enjoyed them. As well as the campaign. 

They say it’s short. But it’s not. Not if you take your time and actually play it in a tactical way. MW2 I played on the hardest difficulty level. And it took me forever. This year I’m playing on normal and I’m having a blast. And it’s taking me a long time. Not 5 or so hours like people are saying. 

I bought MW3 for the campaign. And I’m going to enjoy it. Why rush something to get finished with it? Where’s the fun in that. 

It’s a gorgeous game. Some cutscenes I had to stop and just admire them. Everything looks so real. And it should! 

So if you’re on the fence, and you are not interested in the Multiplayer Kill box scenario but enjoy single player stories, give it a try.! 

I’ll probably play a little multiplayer after I finish the campaign and then I’ll end up leaving like always. Partly because I’m not very good and the other becuase I just never have liked the multiplayer aspect.

But the campaign is great. 

Dont listen to kids who cry about this and that. At its core, it’s a great, engaging, exciting campaign!

If you want an FPS that literally punishes you for learning how to play, this is the game for you. The better you do, the more this company sh*ts on you. 

Every update, be prepared to re-do all of your settings, re-run the benchmark, and re-do all of your blueprints. Want to be promised fixes, only for the game to get progressively more broken as time goes on? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU. Every motherf*cking update this game gets worse, and worse, and worse, and won't run right no matter what. Out of all of the games in my library both on and off Steam, THIS GAME is the ONLY ONE that doesn't run right.

Random 100% CPU usage when  you're not even running the game? AWESOME SIGN ME UP. 
Random 30 FPS Drops even though you're using less than 30% of VRAM. SIGN ME  UP!
Want your UI to be as confusing as possible! SIGN ME UP.

Want to work hard, get gear in DMZ and get killed as soon as you spawn in by Warzone players who are tired of not getting kills? Yup. you guessed it. THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU! 
Do you just want the community to grow progressively more toxic instead of sportsmanship? Yup.. Right here. THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!

Ever wonder what its like to punch yourself in the d*ck repeatedly? Play this game. You'll be punching  yourself in the d*ck for HOURS!

If i could get a refund, I would. But only to buy a bus ticket to the house of the CEO of Activision/Blizzard so I can slap him in the mouth with my d*ck. Never again. How in the f*ck is this the acceptable state of a game from a MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION?!

Back then you could hop on and play after school or work and play a few games and relax. That just isn't the case anymore. Skill-based matchmaking has ruined casual play. Every single game is like fighting for my life to maintain a 1.0 KD. 

I used to always love showing off my KD. I never had an issue keeping my KD above a 2.0-2.5 in most COD games. Right now, after over 500 hours played, I have a 1.08 KD. Right where they want us to be. 

The only time I am able to get a fun game where I am able to get more than maybe a UAV in a match is after I don't play for a week. The game seems to know I need a warm up game first, so it purposefully throws me into a lobby with people that are noticeably lower gun skill than I am. It never fails that my first game back I will be able to drop 40+ kills and have single digit deaths. It makes you feel good. For a single match. 

The very next match is always a complete 180. I have to fight for my life just to get a kill. I will always end that game negative.

From then on for that gaming session, however long I can stand it(usually an hour or 2 before stopping for a week again) it will be just like it was. Fighting hard to stay above a 1 KD throughout the matches every single game.

Also probably an unpopular opinion, but I cannot stand that movement is so much faster nowadays. Everyone is just ""Slide Cancelling"" around corners and jump shooting to get head shots like they're playing Halo. And I'm not saying this because I'm unable to perform these mechanics. I will participate in said mechanics just so I can keep up with these people, but it's not enjoyable. I don't know why everyone is in such a hurry to get from one side of the map to the other. 

I never thought I'd leave a bad review on a game with over 500 hours on it, much less the games I've been playing for over 16 years. But after this last time of going through the same process of having one good game, one horrible game, and then 2 hours of fighting for 1 KD, I just cannot recommend the game anymore. It's not the game I grew up with. 

I have uninstalled Call of Duty for the last time. It's time I move on.

Thank you for all the years of enjoyment you've brought me.",1708211332,1708211332,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

As someone who doesn't typically play Call of Duty very often, I truly enjoy it. The inclusion of classic maps, impeccable sound design rivaling that of Tarkov, and lifelike gun animations are particularly impressive. I believe the criticism towards the game stems from spending excessive amounts of time, around 8-9 hours a day for years, which naturally leads to boredom as graphical improvements reach a plateau. While advancements in graphics are possible, they would likely require high-end hardware accessible to few. Personally, as someone who can only dedicate around 4 hours a day to gaming, I find the game highly enjoyable. The addition of fancy skins and visuals doesn't detract from the overall experience for me. There are numerous engaging game modes available, and even the zombies mode is surprisingly good. I think people are being overly critical of Modern Warfare III; perhaps they are simply playing it too much and becoming jaded.

This review is about MWIII. MWII has it's own issues, but most people aren't going to be buying that.

Do not buy. It's not worth the price tag. The game play isn't rewarding, it doesn't feel satisfying, and it will leave you burnt out and stressed. The game is over-commodified, in that that all Activision cares about is doing things that convince you to buy their microtransactions.

There are plenty of events where you can earn a multitude of rewards, but, to earn those rewards, you have to play frequently, and grind/farm like mad, often for very little visible reward, which is what will leave you burnt out. On top of that in every event, Activision offers special operator packs that will allow you to earn increased progress speed, to incentivize you to buy even more transactions.

It would be one thing if that was the only issue, but the matchmaking is also a problem, with the matchmaking favouring engagement over all else. The game will put you into just enough matches where your performance is good enough that you want to keep playing, and then dump you into a series of matches where you get beaten down again and again. 

There are psychological reasons for this that I won't pretend to understand, but the underlying principle is more or less; If you're angry from a loss, you're more likely to want to continue playing, to prove that you're better. And if you're still playing, then they still have the chance to sell you more microtransactions.

The entire game, from Activision's side, revolves around convincing you to buy these microtransactions.

This game is less of a fun way to pass the time, and more akin to a toxic and very destructive addiction.

There will be nobody around you, then the whole enemy team will spawn behind you or to your side. Obviously there is some type of 'skill' involved to separate the players that can't get a kill at all, compared to others who can go on long killstreaks, but in general it's a children's game of hide and seek or tag, because the time to kill is so low, there's little incentive to be good at aiming or maintaining your aim on a target. The low time to kill also promotes camping or hiding in corners. Snipers kill with 1hit body shots, so why would you ever aim for headshots? Sometimes all you may want to do is to run around like a maniac, kill die kill die kill die every 2 seconds, then Call Of Duty is for you. I used to like the older campaigns and Spec Ops missions were cool. I'm sure there are some newer Campaign modes that have some fun or interesting missions also, but as far as Multiplayer goes, it's pretty terrible except to just mess around with. That's what I'm doing.. I'm not taking it seriously at all, because it's not a quality multiplayer that involves any real skill. As far as stability in the way the game runs, it's been crashing my computer or the game itself crashes. I don't know the cause. Maybe I'm overheating, but the numbers I see don't show that so I don't know what the cause is. What's strange is I see CPU usage (temperature) gain significantly after a match finishes, when it's showing what you've unlocked and then as you're back in the lobby. Why?

and the having to restart the gaem 3 times to play mw2 is dumb as well
ill be adding to this when it crashes a bunch each day
needs balancing fast. mark rifles are just fast snipers and the lmgs are useless
and some of the maps are not fun, one gives me flashbacks of getting stuck at the C spawn on highrise on the og mw2

thier anticheat is also bad 

crashes more now then it did at launch and buggy social button just tosses you back to the menu and it has a hard time replacing players once they leave 

Really needs to stop fucking crashing

just so many crashes crashes in kill cams and in final kills so you lose all exp gained that match, real fun. and then you get discontected from steam and lose your match progress which is great when you are working on camo challenegs...
2 small updates to fix pc crashes adn it still crashes dont buy this pos for 70 back to back crashes in kill cams way to go small update made it worse, crashes when you change attachments in game now fun stuff

Modern Warfare 2 (2022) 
- Not Recommended overall, the movement is clunky, the TTK is way too quick and although the campaign is decent for a Call of Duty, it feels like it lost the grip and realism of the MW19 campaign and ultimately it didn't raise the stakes very much, particularly if you compare it to the OG MW2. Warzone 2 I did not play at all so can not comment on it, DMZ seemed a good idea but I don't think the appeal for it is there compared to other games such as Escape From Tarkov.

Modern Warfare 3 (2023)
- Recommended, overall this game is pretty much an ""DLC"" to MW22, the graphics are precisely the same and you can use MW2 weapons on MW3 as well as attachments and so on. In terms of the multiplayer it is probably the second best in Post-2019 CoD with the exception of Cold War. The movement is fast paced, fluid and overall is similar to MW19 (though still not as good unfortunately) - new features such as Tac Stance are great for close quarters and are a gameplay addition that actually effect the average gameplay (unlike the destruction in Vanguard). The TTK allows for you to actually be able to react to getting shot and so you can reposition or if your better at aiming than your opponents, turn on them and outgun them. In terms of multiplayer, the maps are where this game fell short at launch because although the 2009 MW2 Maps are great, they aren't built for the current movement in CoD and so it does feel a bit clunky, alongside this it adds to the perception that this game was very rushed (which it was), however new original maps have been brought in through seasonal updates and these are good. The reintroduction of the War Mode is one of my favourite parts, there are only two maps as of me writing this however both are extremely fun to play on and accommodate a variety of play styles.

The main area where MW3 has fallen short is the campaign. Again, it is very clear this game was intended to be a DLC initially, and so the Campaign for MW3 is effectively in the Warzone map for the most part and plays just like Warzone. The stakes again are not risen and to be honest the campaign and story progression really has annoyed me as MW19 had laid such a good foundation that was never built on in its sequels.",1669505169,1708128308,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As there's super fun updates every time you start to think this game is any good! But wait! Why not also have to update after the game has started!? Because that's not annoying asf! Welcome to THE call of duty review where they still haven't learnt fa!!! 

In Short Campaign was quite good but felt like a filler excluding the ending as that was pretty good and also one or 2 other missions. 

Coop SUCKS so much that barely anyone plays it

Multiplayer is ok: less jump shotting idiots, Perks are a mess, Killstreaks are quite good, mixture of good and bad maps, guns are VERY hit and miss

Runs ok on pc no screen tear, might want to bump up the graphics as the maps can act weird without it. Updates are still BAD as you'll need to run the game to install further texture updates

4 months in: 

So this will focus more on multiplayer here. It's quite good but like I was saying before it has major issues which are UAVs.
As soon as an enemy UAV goes up you'll get rushed by every idiot on the planet. Can't even counter with ghost as there's a stupid timer for your perks to work. It does reduce camping but can limit what you can do especially if you have dumb teammates.

That bring me onto the next point. Weird asf team balancing?! Yes it can be that boring ""sbm"" or.... Lobbies where either you're destroying players that clearly suck or your stuck with them. There's no hope if your stuck with them as you can be amazing but if your teammates can't handle the other team your on your own all the time.

Summary play for the campaign and don't expect much from the multiplayer

2024 my god  can't even play it without graphich rendering bs for years on end AGAIN how can it be this bad?!

We have found at least 66 bugs (including some pretty serious game playability issues).
The menus are so horrible to use.
I have at times considered uninstalling it.

I'll keep paying because it will get better... but seriously devs... pull your finger out and actually do some testing BEFORE You release the game. OR EMPLOY AND PAY US if you want us to test it for you.

Idiots.

EDIT 27/11/2022: We are now up to 168 bugs, and keep finding more and more! How did this even pass quality control, or do you even have any quality control at all???

Edit 12/12/2022: We are now over 300 bugs, and STILL continue to find more! Now the game limits itself to 30FPS in game, which renders this completely unplayable! Why do you release this crap before it's ready! You're an embarrassment to the industry!

Edit 23/12/2022: We are now up to 385 bugs, including game-breaking bugs like: Cannot find games. Disconnected the moment we shoot at enemies. 200+ms ping times. Inconsistent weapon damage. Inconsistent ping. Cheaters in many games we are in: people tac sprinting away and shooting backwards, people flying through the air shooting, people shooting while tac diving and immediately after landing.
One of our friends has requested his money back, which was declined, even though he has only played a few hours (and a significant portion of that was in the free WZ2).
Seriously, pull your act together already. You've clearly shown us you don't care about the consumer, you only care about fattening your bank accounts and ripping off your consumers.

Further update 23/12/2022. I am now shadowbanned. My username is not offensive. I don't voice chat. I don't text chat. I don't cheat, I am a completely vanilla player. Other users on Reddit have stated they have been banned for a month! What an absolute joke. This game is barely playable at best, and now they have the gall to just shadowban people for listerally NO REASON at all?

Further update 25/12/2022: Thanks for shadowbanning me over the Christmas Holidays, I mean, it's not like I suffer from anxiety going out in public, and don't want to play this game at all... This is one of the few games that I play with friends, and you've shadowbanned me with no way of knowing if I will be reinstated in a few days, a week, a month...
Pull your head out of your backside and get a grip on reality you absolute morons at Craptivision. Kick out your rapist CEO, clean house, and fix up all the myriad of bugs (at last count 400. Yes, FOUR F***ING HUNDRED BUGS in this game.)

Edit 28/12/2022: Finally unshadowbanned. Still finding bug after bug after bug.

Edit 04/01/2024: MW3 is an even worse shitshow, the with lobbies full of cheaters, up to 10% of the lobby is full of people wallhacking, a Zombie mode that only has Chinese servers with a massive 160ms ping, 20 TICK SERVERS!!! IT'S 2023 NOT 1980, GET REAL SERVERS YOU LAZY IDIOTS!!! All other games have tick rates that are MUCH HIGHER than this game's trash tick rate.
There are issues with:
* Mantling
* Moving
* Getting stuck on a single grain of sand
* The ping not being correct (when it shows 20ms, it's more like 100ms to 3 seconds lag (yes, I am on Ethernet).
* Contracts stuck in the ground, making it inaccessible
* Crates drop their contents into the ground, making them inaccessible
* Zombies mode crashing, and loosing all your loot
* Toxic lobbies with people swearing at each other
* The censoring of swearwords does not work (people have written ""Press 1 if you want to kill niggers"" in the chat, or some other toxic racist statement, and a bunch of people will put 1 in the chat - but if you are casually chatting, it will errantly censor a totally normal word.

It's obvious that the developers don't care about this game. MW1 and Cold War were the last good games released by this trash developer.
I'd ask for my money back, but I've played this for far too long to ask for a refund. The only reason I keep playing is because my friends play it.

MW2 and MW3 were released as fully paid when they were at an alpha stage, MW2 barely made it to beta stage before it was canned. And now this piece of trash was crapped out of Activision? I won't be buying any more of your games until I know they are properly developed.
The release of buggy crap games is a disease that games developers need to realise is killing the enjoyment of its fanbase, and making us look elsewhere.

Stuff you Activision.

Update 29/01/2024. MW3 is a piece of trash. It shows how little the devs care about developing a game that is actually enjoyable to make. 20 tick servers? More like 5 tick on a good day. This is the ONLY game that hitches and stutters CONSTANTLY, to the point where it's unplayable. The lobbies are full of cheaters using silent aim and red-box cheats. Activision does not care about the end user.
I'm glad that Cuntick was kicked out by Microsoft, and at this stage I wonder if the QA team have done any work on this game at all. Activision, you're an embarrassment.

EDIT 16/02/2024:
This buggy piece of trash now crashes EVERY GODDAMN GAME THAT I PLAY!

3RD GAME. 3RD CRASH. I COULDN'T REJOIN BECAUSE THE RANKED GAME HAD ENDED WITH A LOSS. AND NOW THEY ARE THREATENING ME WITH A SUSPENSION FOR ""ABANDONING"" THE MATCH?!!!! MAYBE...

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

The most recent release in the Call of Duty franchise has left many players scratching their heads and frustrated with the direction the game has taken. While the graphics and gameplay remain top-notch, a significant flaw has emerged that is impossible to ignore – the excessive demand on storage space.

One of the most egregious issues is the mandatory download of all games within the series to play the latest installment. This decision has left players bewildered and annoyed, as the game requires an astronomical amount of storage space, making it impractical for those with limited resources on their gaming consoles or PCs.

The initial thrill of diving into the new Call of Duty quickly fades when faced with the reality of having to download and store games from previous years. This approach not only feels lazy on the part of the developers but also demonstrates a lack of consideration for players who may not have the luxury of unlimited storage.

The constant struggle to manage storage space has become a game in itself, forcing players to make difficult choices about which games to keep and which to delete to make room for the latest installment. This unnecessary burden detracts from the overall gaming experience and creates frustration rather than excitement.

the mandatory download of previous titles doesn't seem to serve any clear purpose in enhancing the gameplay of the new release. It appears to be a mere ploy to inflate the gamers storage have them to have less games on thier storage and have CoD the only game on storage they are able to play because the large storafe space it requires,

The decision to prioritize quantity over quality in terms of storage requirements is disappointing, especially for longtime fans who were eagerly anticipating a polished and streamlined gaming experience. With other titles offering innovative features and prioritizing user-friendly experiences, Call of duts latest move feels like a step in the wrong direction.

 while the graphics and core gamplay of the new call of duty installment may be commendable, the glaring issue of excessive storage demands significantly detracts from the overall enjoyment. It's a disappointing turn for a franchise that should be focused on delivering exceptional gaming experiences rather than burdening players with unnecessary storage concerns.




TLDR
Do not believe the player count it is based off of 3 games.... Cod MW2 Cod MW 3 and Warzone...
They have a ""COD HQ"" which contains all current CODS doesnt matter waht game you buy weither it be MW2 or MW3 or warzone you will have to download all files from all games weither you want to or not
150gb for this shit?  making me download warzone and mw3? wtf is this
.
THIS HAS BEEN MORE CLEAR WITH THE RECENT MW3 FREE WEEKEND, IT REQUIRES NO DOWNLOAD TO PLAY MW3 IF YOU OWN MW2, 

THE FILES ARE ALREADY DOWNLOADED ON YOUR SYSTEM EVEN IF YOU DONT OWN MW3. 

THEY ARE WASTING YOUR STORAGE SPACE.

But the Developers know how to copy and paste the maps and I like the maps but they apparently do not know how to copy and paste the spawn protection from the older MW games. Maps like Highrise you can easily get spawn trapped and the enemy can just roll in and hang out and wait for you to spawn just to kill you repeatedly right after you spawn. I'm really not understanding how this wasn't a problem 10 f**kin years ago when they had the obvious spawn protection to keep this kind of frustrating bulls**t from happening. Another thing that really upsets me is the fact that this game is thee only game that is 200 GB. Red Dead Redemption 2 inst even that big. And most of the space it is taking is all the skins and everything that could be bought taking up space on your own hard drive. So things I don't even own taking up space on my hard drive...

first of all lets talk about the pros of these games. (all of the recent recycled modern warfare games)

Pro: the game is OVERALL worth playing and having fun with. its a good way to meet friends or just kick back let off some steam.

Pro: it gives a variety of things to do and stuff to learn. new mechanics and game modes to understand slowly but surely. not only that BUT you low-key don't have to play any other game modes if you don't really want to. for example ill almost never play war-zone. its a lame excuse of a battle royal

Pro: as long as you dont have crappy internet it runs very smoothly. i didnt even have a graphics card for a while and it ran fine.

now its time for the Cons.

Con: the players are toxic. but that can be coinsidered a Pro sometimes to because im not friends with you unless your toxic.

Con: Strange performance. so MW2 runs fine but when it comes to MW3 it runs like a fat kid running form the cookie monster. fast but.... not right. 

Con: recycled: yes this game is literally a copy and a paste of the past 2 mw games but it is still fun. if you liked the first 2 youll like this one too

Conclusion: if your a Honest COD fan. and you can afford it. i recommend buying it on sale and playing for an hour and if you dont like it get a refund. hope this review helps. enjoy smashing your keyboard or controller like i smashed that guy who killed me's mom.",1708021146,1708021146,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) Several longstanding bugs just never get fixed, even though they are annoying as hell (e.g. ""Your profile was signed out"" or the constant insane package loss [despite having a very optimised internet connection]).
2) The campaign is just lazy and a bad attempt to re-tell a great story. 
3) The SBMM is out of control (I am not a great CoD player but neither am I a slouch - but after getting thrown into a match where I just get destroyed I get thrown into a match where the enemy feels like bots, only to then be thrown back into the first type of match... and this keeps happening constantly)
4) And then there are the micro-transactions, while they unfortunately have become a long standing component of CoD the skins [operator skins in particular] in this iteration are just plain bad. One microtransaction even charged you for the soundtrack of the original MW2 to be played in the main menu... - nothing but making you pay for memberberries

Now to be fair - the game has some good things about it (otherwise I wouldn't have sunk as many hours into it as I did)
1) The gunplay just feels good.
2) The Zombies and Warzone modes are just plain fun
3) A lot of memberberries for which you don't have to pay and allow you to revisit some beloved maps from previous installments in the series
4) The seasonal content provides reasons to return to the game

It will contain 3 segments: 

1. a story.
2. an atmosphere.
3. the technical stance.

Let's begin:

[h1]Story [/h1]

Modern Warfare franchise has always been about ""the struggle of good against evil"", where in the end ""good"" are always won. Joint missions, covert operations, high quality scenery, MilSim style etc.

This ""campaign"" has none of this. Story is clunky, short and non immersive. Caracters are weak. Even [b]Price [/b]! Story is weak. Ending is weak. And gives developers the opportunity to ""milk money"" from fans for this weak rebooted storyline for at least 1 time. Maybe 2 times [spoiler](possible MW4, MW5 games) [/spoiler].

Playing ""campaign"" feels similar to watch Fast and Furious. [spoiler]No one loves, but always watching. [/spoiler]

[h1]Atmosphere [/h1]

Non existing at all. As a fan, I was struggled to play this short ""campaign"" and forced to split is in 3 days. Open combat missions [spoiler](Warzone & DMZ tutorial)[/spoiler] is terrible and boring. No ""meaningful dialogues"" between me and my team. Only spam the same quotes that i ""need to go somewhere to do something, else ""they"" will won and cause a big trouble"".

Mission ""No russian"", that was hyped in the end of MW II, was a complete disaster and basically a ""playable"" cutscene.

MilSim style got worse. No good cammo and realistic patterns. Red accents -- for bad guys, blue -- for good. No uniqueness in enemies.

The overall direction of missions is weak and forced. Feels like i am playing this weird CO-OP without random players.

[h1]Technical stance [/h1]

Descent. I've got a bug or two this and there. Not critical. From another standpoint, this game is a pure cannibalism of previous games in this franchise. Same mechanics, models, textures and VFX'es. 
But worse! I don't know how they manage to do this..

[h1]Conclusion [/h1]

Overall, this is the worst campaign in this franchise ([spoiler]including an OG MW games [/spoiler]). The funny and sad is that, that I've said the same thing for MW II...

But somehow, Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, Treyarch, Beenox and Activision Blizzard overcome themselves and publish a worse product that they did last year.

I am shure, that all of these people, who works in these studios, need's to be fired and the studios are need's to be closed. Once and forever. They all have no respect in the community of devs and players. More of that, Fanbase are haiting them all, arguing, and saying out loud that ""they did all it wrong"". 

That's the story.. and this review. 

As a fan of MW series, i will never buy a single product from this devs (Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, Treyarch, Beenox, etc.), that got maked in a short period of time (1 year or less). This is HILARIOUS, that so much people making this game and it is still BAD.

No microtransactions will be bought, no battle passes (and battle passes for battle passes) will be bought too. Never!

[spoiler]F*ck you all [/spoiler]!

This is the last 70$ from me to you, cash grabbers. Enjoy it. 

I've had enough.

Gameplay Experience: A Study in Inconsistencies

🔫 Mechanics & Gunplay:
The game embarks on a more grounded, tactical route, favoring a realistic military shooter experience. While this decision could be commendable, the gameplay suffers from inconsistencies, resulting in a slower, less fluid gaming experience. A particular issue lies in erratic hit detection and the inexplicable inconsistency in delivering damage. The wallbang mechanics, a notable feature in previous versions, show glaring inconsistencies, leading to a lack of realistic strategy in gameplay dynamics.

🔫 Gunplay & Animation Details:
Despite these challenges, the sound design and animation details are commendable. The guns boast intricate and captivating animations, featuring meticulous details such as full and empty inspections, diverse reload animations, and high-fidelity models. However, these animation details and high-quality sounds fail to translate into a consistent or satisfying gameplay experience.

Graphics & Maps: Striking Visuals and Uneven Design Choices

🎨 Visuals & Aesthetics:
From a pure graphical standpoint, the game delivers stunning visuals that could easily be considered superior. Yet, the overall aesthetic choices, including color selection, LUTs, and design decisions, might seem inconsistent and at times, subpar. The reliance on photogrammetry scans for 3D models, while trying to imbue realism, inadvertently uses low-quality and unrealistic real-life equipment. The result is a jarring dichotomy that affects the game's overall visual coherence.

🗺️ Maps & Design:
Despite the visual appeal, the map design is predominantly impressive, showcasing a mix of classic and new maps. However, experimental maps like Santa Sena Border Crossing detract from the overall map design. The issue lies in the erratic spawning system, leading to players spawning in the middle of active gunfights or excessively close to enemy positions, hampering the overall gaming experience.

Multiplayer & Combat: Nostalgia Meets Unfair Competition

🎮 Multiplayer Dynamics:
The multiplayer experience remains true to the Call of Duty formula but introduces a different scenario for PC players with the inability to disable crossplay. The drawbacks include console players hotmicing music, as well as an overly strong aim assist that creates an uneven playing field, favoring controller users.

🔫 Weapon Mechanics:
Weapons feature a detailed and captivating design with appealing animations. However, the inclusion of seemingly redundant separate weapons takes away from potential customization options. Despite the intriguing design, weapon inconsistencies and gameplay mechanics remain a sticking point.

Campaign & Updates: A Narrative Miss and Skewed Customizations

🎭 Campaign Narrative:
The game's campaign, while attempting to deliver an above-average gaming experience, fails to present a compelling and coherent narrative. Betrayals within the storyline feel predictable and lack the emotional depth seen in previous iterations.

🔧 Updates & Customization:
The game's updates frequently yield controversial outcomes, impacting the game's overall balance. The inclusion of skins such as Nikki Minaj and 21 Savage appears incongruent with the realistic theme and draws criticism for deviating from the core military and modern warfare essence.

Summing up, the game weaves together impressive strengths and critical drawbacks, displaying a mix of progress and areas that urgently need refinement and enhancements across various facets of gameplay and overall experience.",1667177433,1707953391,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Of course, the VPN work around comes with an additional cost. But its better than not being able to play the game.",1707952021,1707952021,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game was built for a controller. If you have 4k monitor or curved, be ready to make adjustments that never seem to work right. The sensitivity and bullet registration is horrible. If you don't have an fov of at least 100, your sniper bullets won't hit long shots. Numerous bugs and glitches. I almost feel like the owe me the other half of the game. Graphics are a pain to adjust because it doesn't seem to self adjust with their onboard operating system. I had to change the thread count in documents to get it somewhat properly working so my computer won't bottleneck. I think Activision should pay me to play this worst horrendous COD I have ever played as far as the OS goes or their UI. The game itself and multiplayer experience is a great idea but, the mechanics in making the game work on PC is terrible. I don't even know why this game is even up for game of the year? Whomever is behind that idea, hasn't played the game. They are constant with patches. Maybe it will be enjoyable in the future. By that time though, I have a feeling we will be back to having a half built game again. As this seems to be the re_occurring theme with Activision. That's why Bungie left!
 Update MW3: Hellava improvement I must say and a lot of my judgement of MW3 was probably because of a noob mistake of not realizing the comparison of my 4K monitor and the under power of my  Nvidia GTX 1660 Super on a modern developed game in 2024.

Multiplayer is what you would expect, the better you get at the game the sweatier the opponents you face thanks to skill based matchmaking, the bane of multiplayer games. Most of us come home from work and want to unwind, not get thrown into a fucking E-Sports lobby filled with people on Jobseeker's allowance. That have nothing to contribute to society other than their win/loss ratio.

I've been plagued with connection issues from day one, random disconnects for no fucking reason at all. Packet loss etc. 2024 and we still have bullshit issues that are present due to likely copy pasting the game.

All the guns are fake, Activision are so tight they can't even licence real weapons.

Microtransactions galore, it's a storefront with a game added on. Not going to lie, i'd buy the Nicki Minaj skin if they ever re released it. Just to see dat badonk badonk.

Zombies is slightly fun if not repetitive, oh and if you get dropped or D/C say goodbye to your loot, guns, equipment. Might as well just kill yourself too that's how hard a reset you're given.

Tons of crashes, glitches, and bugs. maps are horrible. AI bans for voice communication are an awful addition. updates are advertised and then delayed due to horrible QC checks. Wanna see how strong SBMM truly is? check STEMIstreams on YT and you'll see how good a normal player can do if joining a friend that has awful stats. pretty much unplayable if you don't want to play with a hidden rank. 

My hours are only high in this game due to them merging MW2/ MW3 with a brain dead COD HQ ""feature""

edit: 96 hours following review I was riddled with direct x crashes making ranked unplayable. thios developed in to being unable to start the game, kernel-power issues on PC all the sudden (only with this game). Reinstalled the game, deleted and reinstalled direct x files, reinstalled windows, verified game files, reinstalled new drivers and deleted old, updated windows, attempted to run game as admin with no solution. took it to a shop, first time thats been necessary for me- and they were unable to fix it after almost a week. ended up reinstalling windows and got the game to finally start, this time with C++ erorrs on load. safe mode doesn't help. two days since picking pc up from shop, swapping components to a massive upgrade with no fix. Tonnnns of crashes now related to direct x again, despite no errors found when running dxdiag. 

TLDR: game is optimized to shit, and guys at shop (which is highly rated) said half their business lately is due to COD issues following December updates.",1705829101,1707909811,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

newest updated got on it after a while and well you guessed it, still trash! but lets add some new skins like fortnite.

This is still the worst lag no matter the setting changes. SBMM has completely ruined the multiplayer experience, its far worse than any previous call of duty SBMM.

Edit 6 months later: Ok, I can't stand this anymore. The game is fun when it works, but it is CONSTANTLY crashing. It is at comical levels of crashing. The number of times my team will be in top 20 in Warzone then the game crashes is insane. I'm beyond peeved at this point at the fact that six months after launch they still haven't fixed the crashing, but will keep adding new maps, etc., so they can keep the console plebs happy, while PC (which has been growing year after year) is getting no actual decent support regarding optimization and simple error handling. What an absolute joke. Eat bricks Activision.

good ol' call of duty. No more crackheads slide cancelling everywhere which is super nice, guns feel really good.

I don't play the single player campaign, so I cannot comment on it, but the feedback I heard is it sucked. Gun play for the multiplayer, in my opinion is better than MW2. weapons feel faster, sound better and operator movement is quicker. I agree that for $70 minimum cost  MW3 should have been A DLC. Whoever Dev's are left working at COD that wasnt fired after microsoft took over doesn't seem to know or prioritize the development of good new maps, that is why they are bringing back tons of maps from MW2 such as Breenbergh Hotel, Scrapyard and Shoothouse which are good, but this is a stand alone new product and not acceptable. This is season 2 and my point is being proven in almost every round I play, when It comes down to voting on map play, the MW2 maps win in selection over the ""spectacular new maps just released"" for the new season. Release a DLC and advertise it as MW3 and make 70 to 100 dollars of us players, no more pre-purchase for me. If you already own MW2 please wait for this to go on deep discount, it's season 2 and I haven't seen anything to justify this price tag.",1676767339,1707851678,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Les anciens bons points qui ont changé :
- le slide encore bugué (dès fois je cours et j'essaies de slide, mais le jeu prend pas mes inputs.... bizarre) mais le feeling des gun est bon, dynamique
- moins d'fps qu'avant (entre 220 - 315 fps selon les maps), maintenant c'est entre 220 - 280)
- bonne visibilité de base (que tu peux améliorer dans tes paramètres de cg)

Les bons points :
- bonne visibilité de base (que tu peux améliorer dans tes paramètres de cg)
- le feeling est bon
- des petites maps sont arrivées, on peut mieux se défouler maintenant (ils sont pas oufs mais ça passe)
- ils ont nerf le weapon sway sur les armes (c'est une bonne nouvelle pour les joueurs clavier/souris)

Les mauvais points qui ont pas changé :
- ttk est toujours super inconsistant (dès fois t'as l'impression de mettre 3 balles et dès fois 10)
- les serveurs sont toujours vraiment à chier (packet burst presque à chaque game)
- l'input clavier souris est toujours très très bizarre, juste un peu plus fluide qu'avant
- les maps grandes sont nostalgiques, c'est cool, mais elles sont pas adaptées au gameplay dynamique que nous offre le jeu (maps à grosse campouze)
- l'EOMM (c'est pas du SBMM) qui a pas changé et qui me met encore avec des bots recrues mais j'affronte des tryhards aussi chauds que moi, imbuvable, je peux même pas jouer avec mes potes... enlevez ça par pitié, parce-que là vous pouvez pas vous plaindre des personnes qui RB, c'est le seul moyen pour avoir un peu de fun sur le jeu.

Main issue for me is respawns in the smaller online maps; you can spawn in front of an enemy's fire, spawn on a grenade, in the line of a killstreak, in direct view of a turret, etc. ""Spawnkills"" are on absolute steroids in this game and so much worse than the older Call of Duty games.

Your life will honestly be better if you just stay away - sad to see that this is what this franchise has become. Honestly a cosmetic money grab rather than a balanced, solid, fun game.

But even worse is that forces you to download frequent updates to other games before you can access the games you paid for. And sometimes those unneeded updates will just corrupt and lock you out.

It remains to my knowledge as the most consistent high profile franchise to last these many years. It does this through unmatched Gun play and fluidity. So much so, that discourse between players often comes down to minor changes between games that would see much less criticisms from other games players. Regardless what title you play, your in for some Smooth, well crafted game play.

What Drags it all down, is its incredibly predatory business practices, often putting much more time and effort into getting you to spend money, then providing meaningful content. It has figured out the perfect rhythm to keep the drip feed tolerable, and while everyone is different, those who continue to play release after release act like they have Stockholm syndrome.

First of all the Campaign was extremely short, one of the shortest Call of Duty Campaign out there, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 was 10 hours Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was 9 hours: Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was only 5 hours long. The developers that were complaining on Twitter when Christopher Judge the voice of Kratos called them out at the game awards for the game being too short should just all shut up. They spent more time making the microtransactions for this game than they did making longer stories and better content. 

The story itself is a joke. The fact that they ran out of story ideas and now they are relying on remastering the old story and changing the story just a little bit is a joke. 

The PvP sucks. It's not as bad as Destiny 2 PvP but it's still pretty bad. In almost every game mode you have to deal with enemy teams with big mouths and small brains and everyone does the same repetitive trash things jumpshoting, proning, sliding, spawn manipulation, and grenade launchers: if I had a nickel for every time I've heard a grenade launcher be used in a match I'd be a multi-millionaire by now: also abusing overpowered weapons like automatic shotguns with thermite rounds pretty much scumbags doing the scummiest things imaginable because they're bad and they need crutches like that to try to win fights. So yes, the PvP is extremely terrible, and skill-based matchmaking and spawn locations are poorly designed. 

The biggest part of the franchise, the zombie’s part has been pretty much overlooked. They recently released a battle pass season that's all about zombies and they didn't make any changes to MWZ they really should add more stories to MWZ and more content but they're not either because they're lazy or they don't care. It's funny that they're doing the same stereotype that Epic Games did with their zombie game mode Save the World. The legitimate only reason why I even bought this game in the 1st place was for the zombies, there's not even a round-based zombie game mode. If they don't add any new content to any of the zombie stuff, I'm just going to uninstall the game because zombies are what made Call of Duty what it is today, not PvP the two things that made Call of Duty what it is was the amazing story and the zombies game mode and both of those right now are extremely lackluster. 

Truthfully, in my opinion, none of the developers behind this game should be in the gaming industry anymore. It's easy to tell that they probably cheated all their university exams to graduate because when you look at how crappy this game is and how it's just a cash grab for money and they put as little effort into as possible putting things like skin collecting and weapon leveling as content when all it is is just blatant repetitive farming that's very easy to develop. What they really should have done was make a better and bigger story instead of the ingame store. This game could have been amazing, but it is just a mediocre cash grab from Activision as usual. I would love to see Activision go bankrupt for all the horrible things they've done to the gaming industry and cod but that's never going to happen because too many people voted with their wallets. P.T. Barnum once said, There's a sucker born every minute and that's why Activision has been alive for this long.",1707772497,1707772497,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Nerfing and buffing in the lobbies real time, revenge spawning (if you are doing too good they let you spawn in front of the enemies) and ai bots wall hacking to name a few. This was good game a few years back. Now, like this, I have to say it is the worst cod ever made :(. If it does not change, I'm afraid a lot of old school people will never buy another cod ever again :(. Update  9 Jan: it is getting worse even more. Soo many cheaters and soo many ai bots cheating, it is insane. I think the game is dead and Microsoft bought a dead game :( Once upon a time it was really good.. Does my review have any impact? I can't rule it out. DONT BUY IT and DON'T buy any bundels!!!!!!! Update 14 Jan: Now the game hates me, I'm getting packet bursts all the time, login out of Steam a couple of times mid game, fog is increasing but NOT for my team mates. It is just a bad game where cheaters and money rules. If they get rid of EOMM maybe it is a real good game, for the most people not cheating it is a really bad bad game.. I'm never gonna buy any Cod ever again if this is not changing. And that make me sad. Update 16th: today it was the worst day playing cod in 15 years. In every lobby cheaters or ai bot cheating, revange spawning, kill me through walls. Amazing how they think this game will people buy bundles and perhaps buy a new game in the future? I will never buy a new cod ever again it is soooo bad right now. Microsoft bought a dead franchise :( IT IS DEAD.DEAD,DEAD!!!! Did I say dead? 27 Jan: All lobbies today had multiple cheaters and ai bot cheating. Omg this game is so, so bad, and if game decided you should lose or you do too good in their opinion: revenge spawning, your damage output gets nerfed, it is insane. But activision thinks I'm having fun like this, with their algorithm . The only reason why I didnt delete this game yet is because I want to kill some peeps with my friends. 27 Jan: I lost 13 matches in a row because I say the thruth that this is the worst Cod ever made with the nerfing, buffing, cheaters and ai bot cheating.. the game is now punishing me hahaha. What a joke Cod has become :( Only money money money so I'm never gonna buy a bundle before they fix this. 1 Feb: lost 8 matches in a row, all lobbies had cheaters, wall hackers, trigger bots and I do believe most are ai bots. Spawning is soooo bad... and the say EOMM is not here.. hahaha hitmarks on headshots with sniper or packet burst when you to well. This game is so so so so bad. Like this, it is the worst cod ever!! All the old school players who not cheating will find other games.. :( dead game.. really a shame. 2 Feb: worst cod ever like this. We never should buy a bundle or a new cod ever before they fix this. Now I'm punished for my remarks.. losing almost all gunfights and matches. Cod is really dead. I only play it because of my friends. If Xdefiant would launch without these strong downsides, Microsoft bought something really dead and the community (not the white listed cheating streamers at first) wil move swiftly.. NO CHANGE NO MONEY. Worst COD, I'm ever never gonna buy a bundle or a new game ever. It is soooooooooo bad. 12 Feb: Cod decided I'm not allowed to chat in game because they don't like my comments. How lame right? They don't like me telling them that all lobbies have cheaters, all lobbies have ai bots cheating manipulating the outcome of the game (damage output get nerfed, they are putting in stronger ai bots cheating to lose your game with just 1 point and they think you have fun) The game is just rigged, it is really the worst cod ever with all the cheaters and ai bot cheating and nerfing and buffing you real time. DONT BUY THE GAME, DONT BUY ANY COD,  DONT BUY ANY BUNDLES incl. BLACKCELL. It is that bad :( I'm gonna miss this game as it was 5 or 10y ago :( I made much friends, but it is unplayable and they punish you when you say it is bad..

This latest season introduced a microstutter that is so horrendous its unplayable.  I have done driver updates, reinstalled the game nothing works.

There seems to be three-story buildings on just about every map or multiple two-story buildings that people put up a camp-sight in and just gun you down. There's maps like Highrise where you had better not go down middle unless you want someone who stayed in spawn with a long range weapon and scope to gun you down (but of course there is ALWAYS and objective right smack in the middle). Gone are the days of players sprinting around full speed with SMGs and ARs and getting in exhilarating gunfights. The maps are just soooooo bad and camping is rewarded so highly, that if you're a run and gunner, you may as well not play. Zombies looks fun, but every time i go to match-make, it can't find people to play with until the search expands to the 200-ish ping ranges. I can't speak for Warzone, because I haven't tried it.

It's as if the developers are just going through the motions, offering nothing innovative or exciting to keep players engaged.

Glitch Fest: I've encountered more bugs and glitches in this game than I can count. From characters getting stuck in walls to weapons disappearing mid-firefight, the experience is riddled with frustrating technical issues that should have been ironed out long before release.

Pay-to-Win Microtransactions: COD used to be about skill and strategy, but now it seems like the only way to get ahead is by shelling out more cash. The game is inundated with pay-to-win microtransactions that give paying players a significant advantage, making it feel more like a cash grab than a fair competition.

Bland Storyline: The single-player campaign, once a highlight of the franchise, is now nothing more than a forgettable, paint-by-numbers experience. The storyline lacks depth and originality, failing to captivate or immerse players in any meaningful way.

Toxic Community: Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of all is the toxic community that has taken root within the game.

sledgehammer fixed the majority or at least a great number of the stupid decisions infinity clown created. But it really doesn't matter cause the classic MW2 maps are trash. people enjoy them because of rose tinted glasses. the majority of the maps are oversized and only a handful are actually playable. 
        aside from the maps, the servers are trash with constant packet loss and burst. then on top of that the game is max level sweat. cause activision loves to crank that SBMM or EOMM to the max making anybody even slightly above average play against sweats 24/7. i got like a .96KD the lowest it's ever been in this trash, and a .80 win rate comparing to BO4 which i had a winrate of 2.0+ and averaged 3KD. it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that these numbers don't add up and you should get better with each game instead of ""worse"". the game is trash.

This is by far the worst call of duty ever made hands down with the worst post launch support of any COD ever, do not support these developers or game. it took them 6 months to add one new original 6v6 map, infinity ward needs to be axed immediately they are the worst of the three developers and are actually full on incompetent. do not support them or this dogshit game.

update12/20/22:          my name has literally been banned for being offensive which was ""latinaparfait"", the report system is entirely automated and anybody can abuse it. this game is a complete and utter joke.

be nice if the game stopped crashing every 5 minutes. joe cecot needs to be suplexed into dessert dave's RV. everything in the game is rigged. the spawns are rigged and if you go on a killstreak they well intentionally spawn you with the enemy team multiple times in a row, the matchmaking is rigged, footsteps and even the hit detection. everything in this game is designed to make every player have a 1.0KD. it's honestly digsuting, it's disugsting how garbage and rigged the game is.

the game has more LGBTABC flags and emblems than non ones, no US flag? but well have the 500 different abc flags in the game. modern infinity ward are masters of being clowns.",1666930037,1707624761,False,8,3,0.398699283599853516,13,True,False,False

Seriously, this game has SO MUCH potential to be one of their best. MWZ is by far the most interesting zombies, but is so riddled with bugs and so punishing to the player when one is encountered that it's actually mind-blowing. 

Here's a couple examples: 
 - When you complete an aether extractor mission at the exact same second that the timer runs out, you get eliminated. No calling for help, no going down, just dead.
 - When you use the scorcher multiple times in a row to fly, and it lags for a sec, you will hit the ground and go down at the exact moment the second charge goes off, launching your downed body into the air, which will then eliminate you as soon as your land. No requesting help, just eliminated, round over, stuff lost.
 
There are MANY MORE, but these are just the ones that have happened to me in the past few weeks. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if the game didn't punish the player so heavily for this. Losing all your inventory, loadout, everything, is a waste of several hours, not to mention whatever you were trying to accomplish that run. Trying to complete the easter egg and finally had all four golden items in your inventory? Start over. Finally get a recipe you've been looking for? Lose it and try again. Yet when you log back in, there are the popups to remind you to give them more money via micros. Do they put that money toward making sure their game is in a proper state? Of course not. 

Would love to give this game a glowing review because it has so much stuff going for it, but with these sorts of issues and no compensation to the player when the bugs happen (their bug report isn't linked to your account, so they have no way of contacting or compensating you, and so i believe nobody reads them), it's just a complete feels-bad every few runs when another game-breaking bug is ran into. 

Fix your game so I can recommend it please.",1707603238,1707603238,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

game is dog vomit. came with less features than mw2019 and the same problems. missing features other titles had at launch. butchered gen shepherd as a character in the campaign. the only redeeming feat of the game is its multiplayer, but even then its even more broken and buggy than mw 2019, oh and dont even get me started on proximity based flash bangs, gotta lower the skill ceiling for the shitters. the UI makes me want to claw my eyes out of my damn skull, why did we move to horizontal when vertical was so much better? ever hear the saying ""if it aint broke, dont fix it""? why they even thought to make this dogshit UI is beyond me. while they have fixed SOME of the bugs in the menu it appears at least half the bugs they fixed were only partially fixed. i shit you not if they made a direct copy of 19 and added on to it (new guns, more challenges, etc) that shit would be better than what we got. HOW THE ACTUAL HELL DO YOU NOT HAVE HARDCORE AT LAUNCH LIKE EVERY OTHER CALL OF DUTY TITLE OUT THERE??? it makes no sense to me.

on the brightside, the game lobbies remind me of the good old days back on MW2 id rather just sit in a lobby that has people talking rather than play and just listen to the funny shit that gets said, but it aint gonna last forever unfortunately, i garuntee they soy filled idiots over at activision/infinity ward are gonna crack down hard on the only thing that makes this game remotely entertaining.

Edit: the red diamond over my head in core multiplayer is fucking stupid, remove it please.

edit 2: another 307 hours in and its passable for a complete game but its still dogshit

edit 3: 791 hours in these are my final remarks:
fuck activision blizzard, fuck infinity ward, and most importantly fuck this franchise as a whole. the lazy writing and the constant inability to release an update that doesnt make the game unplayable for a week really killed it, i grinded for my camos thats all this games getting. no longer am i gonna submit to call of corperations: consume product. in the end mw2 was still trash, blackcell was just a blatant money grab because the smart players were saving their cod points and losing them out on some of that microtransaction money. im tired of battle passes, im tired of these companies abusing FOMO and more importantly im tired of seeing one of my childhood franchises turn into this blatant cashgrab instead of the passion project made by a company dedicated to their craft. im not purchasing mw3, and i probably wont purchase any cod titles in the future, and honestly they should of just released mw3 as an addon to mw2. definitely not at the price of over 80 fucking dollars. yall are fucked if you think im paying 80 fucking dollars for an expansion pack of a game that was mid as fuck. not to even mention they fact they do nothing about the blatant hackers that advertise themselves on x/twitter, youtube, etc. the only reason activision blizzard gets to continue making this slop instead of going out of buisness is because daddy microsoft wants to absorb them. this company deserves to fail at this point. i wish i could get those 791 hours back.",1668598848,1707559812,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Plenty of modes and events cycling, the daily and challenge system is a good amount of dopamine and there's not too many annoying ones. 
I like some of the newer systems like attachment challenge unlocks (e.g. complete two dailies to unlock a chosen attachment, even ones that usually require fully levelling weapons). And above all.. the game is just fun, MW2019 particularly the maps were mostly utter crap, MW2 was an improvement mostly, and MW3 using has a good mix of classic MW2 maps and newer ones added since release. The ones in the new season I like a lot! And stuff like the changed maps for events are really cool.
Overall the state of the game is an 8/10 again now (I would have considered MW2 a 6/10 shortly before MW3 came out, a mess of mismanagement).",1667007360,1707554351,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Needs more regular and realistic camos and operator skins and less neon vomit. Also i cant stand the fact that every operator has to be some tier 1 edgelord or some celebrity and or other character from media. Just give us generic soldiers and let us customize every aspect with them like in COD ghosts.  Also custom gun camos, decals and emblems needs to return.

 The micro transaction system is extremely predatory and greedy as well. I think there needs to be more things that require skill or in game milestones to unlock.

 Skill  based matchmaking is awful as well because you either roll lobbies or get rolled. SBMM makes the game feel to competetive and sweaty when i just wanna get into a random lobby and just chill out. 

The moderation system is horrible to using AI to monitor in game voice chats is a terrible idea as well. The concept of  using AI to monitor VC is just extremely creepy and dystopic just because a few select individuals get offended at players on an M rated game. I can understand it being used to stop people from saying things that are flat out racist or whatever but where are you going to draw the line with it. If people get offended they can just mute the person, thats why a mute button exists.

EDIT: 
So i caved in and got MW3 just to give it a fair chance and actually play the game. Literally just a copy and  paste of MW2 from the UI, weapon unlock system, scorestreaks etc. SBMM is destroying the game for casual  players. The one thing i do like about this game is the invasion and ground war game modes. The SBMM isnt as strong feeling in it and alot of the people who play those modes are more casual fans of the series so those servers dont really feel sweaty. But outside of those two game modes MW3 is pretty terrible. If i could refund it i would.

MW3 update: Season 2 just dropped and they still keep adding in dumbass cosmetics and skins, as well as ramping up SBMM ill literally have games with what appear to be bots based on how the players move then i know the next 4-5 games will be a sweat fest. I just want to experiment with different weapons and attachment combos but its impossible to when everyone is playing as their life's are on the line IRL. If you dont use a meta weapon and loadout its impossible to keep up with all of these tryhard wanna be content creators and streamers who never touch grass.

After eagerly anticipating it for some time, I finally got the chance to dive into the world of Zombies with my son. I patiently waited for a discount before purchasing the game, ensuring we could both enjoy the experience together.

As for the game itself, it has provided us with countless hours of enjoyment. The Zombie campaign (Act 1-4) injects a sense of purpose and challenge into the gameplay, with plenty of opportunities for exploration. While we encountered a few bugs that necessitated a restart in the menus (never during gameplay), overall, the experience has been fulfilling. Admittedly, the menu design might be a bit confusing for newcomers, but I appreciate the concept of having all games accessible from a single interface.

Regarding my support experience, I encountered an issue with some additional skins I purchased (Blackcell) not appearing in-game. Upon discovering that others had faced similar issues through community comments, I promptly opened a ticket with Activision. To my delight, I received a comprehensive answer and solution within a mere 2 hours.

In summary, this game offers both an enjoyable gaming experience and exceptional customer support. I highly recommend giving it a try, especially with the current 3-day free trial available. Gather some friends or family and embark on this thrilling adventure together.

Happy gaming!",1707514406,1707514406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I came back I find that spawn killing is worse than ever. What is with these micro transactions?!?! The price for each one is ridiculous and they just keep adding more! Which sounds good in theory but when 99 percent of the items are useless, kinda ugly junk, it defeats the purpose of adding them. It looks like someone with ADHD designed most of the skins, emblems, and calling cards. Almost all includes rapidly flashing lights and rapidly moving waves of light and color. Some could look good if they stopped trying to treat this as a techno rave party. Give us an option to slow it all down! I do not have any issues with seizures and things like that. I just find these as ugly distractions, both of which are unwanted. You can tell all they want is us to give them more money for things that should all ready be included in the game. Or at least be reasonably priced! And also they will not allow you to buy only the one item you are interested in. They make you purchase a bundle of items I do not want and will never use thus making you pay even more for nothing. This newest update, season 2 battlepass, removed the lethal grenades from several of my loadouts!!! For no reason and without ant kind of notification. The weapon attachment system needs a lot of changes. Yes we can use more attachments now but their effects are illogical and sometimes contradictory. Not to mention why is there a number limit on the amount of attachments that you can use?!?! If you make it, use it!

This continues to be aimed at kids and just reminds me why I switched to Battlefield 3 in the past. Are they any better now? I don't know. I just realize that I probably will not purchase any more releases of this franchise. If I was not trying to play with friends I would not have purchased this one.

A) The massive amount of cheaters. Seeing people track you through 2 walls or consistently headshot-ing you across the map with an SMG is no fun. 

B) The crossplay is just nonsense or rather giving controller players really strong aim assist is. There is no way the average player can win against a slide-canceling guy rushing around the corner with this strong of aim assist. Hilariously THEY have the ability to turn off crossplay.

C) No dedicated servers are a terrible idea when combined with skill based match making. 1 minute I am in a lobby with excellent ping. The next minute I am in a lobby with huge packet loss, huge latency, and a full clan of ranked players. 

D) No dedicated servers (again) also means their weird playlists with garbage maps like shipment. Don't get me wrong shipment can be fun but with CODs spawn system it is a real shit-show every time. I think it isn't a viable map for anything but FFA. I, however, like objective based game modes which shipment is a terrible map for. So, I would like to be able to elect not to play it.

Game is getting better by trying to appeal to a more immersive playerbase with the big team battles, but the pricing model needs to change as well as the battlepass scam system. Everything needs to be more easily unlockable. At the moment things are gatekept so hard behind events, previous battle passes, the unlock system at its core is bad enough. 

1: Go back to basics with unlocking, this armory system is absurd
2: battle pass needs to be modified so you can go back to previous battle passes and its much easier to complete
3: need a classic playlist with zero advanced movement
4: guns need to have rate of fire slowed down so people arent being insta gibbed, shotguns need a longer range. Pump shotguns need a huge buff to power.

Season 1 & 2 Review:
FIX YOUR F'ING SPAWN SYSTEM. How do you mess up MW2 & MWII Map spawns. Why am I spawning infront of an enemy. WHY IS THE ENEMY SPAWNING AT A POINT WHEN MY TEAM CAPTURED IT. WHY IS MY TEAM MATE SPAWING INFRONT OF ME WHEN I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF A GUNFIGHT. FIX IT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FIX THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SPAWN SYSTEM.

MWIII Pre Season 1 Review: 

Multiplayer: Not recommended

- MWII weapons are op and should have waited till MWIII season 1 to put them in.

- They ruined the spawns on the OG MW2 maps. Spawns are terrible and I mean fucking terrible to the point where it's annoying. Enemies spawn right behind you. You spawn right next to them and they kill you and your whole team. Stop with the whole squad spawn or whatever it is you have and just use normal spawn + spawn protection (with how shit the spawns are spawn protection is needed).

- SBMM is toned up to the point where I see 0 to little  improvement in my game-play compared to the previous cods 2019-now. Tone this shit down. 

Gunsmith, Gun-play, Movement, gear perk system are solid. This game has a good foundation and the main fixes to mp that are needed is SBMM & the spawn system that's it. 
 
Zombies: recommended
- More to do than outbreak.
- More fun than DMZ. 
L> Lots of missions and contracts that give you solid rewards.
- Chill camo grind.
- Fun solo and treats solo players well.
- Other players can be annoying and ruin your train when doing kills for camos.
-  Difficulty zones is awesome.

Please add round base. I've been wanting a MW zombies for years and this is really good but adding round base would be dope. Add back the outbreak contract that would put you in a 2 story building and you fight hordes of enemies. I'm impressed with how good zombies is and it's better than I thought it would've been. Keep up the good work on MWZ and expand on it.

MWII Final Season Review: Mixed

I've been on and off this game from launch all the way until mid-season 3. After that, I played the game on a daily basis, except for mid-season 5, when my PC broke. I put 400+ hours into this game. I did Orion, Ghoulie, and 90% of the calling cards for MWII MP. I beat campaign and spec ops. This game is by far the worst modern warfare game, but it is a mid-cod game and is better than BO4 and Vanguard, two of the worst cods, in my opinion. Besides the ♥♥♥♥ launch, like I said, this game is mid. Here are my pros and cons.

Cons:
- Perk system: 2/4 of them are based on time, which was stupid; no one asked for this.

- The weapon level system was dumb as ♥♥♥♥; I don't want to level up my shotgun for a red dot.
on my AK. This feature is annoying at first, but once you level up a category, family, and/or all weapons it's fine

- SBMM

- Servers: from seasons 4–5, this game would crash my whole system basically whenever I would get any sort of latency or connection issue and was extremely annoying.
- Optimization: again, from seasons 4–5, this game ran like ♥♥♥♥. I went from playing at all high settings 90-100fps to putting everything to all low except for textures to get the same fps. This game looks worse than 2019, and in that game, I get better performance at max than this ♥♥♥♥.

- Spawn system: Whoever added squad spawn is a moron. If I'm playing domination and I cap A and B I own those areas, and only me and my team should spawn at A and B; enemies shouldn't spawn next to me. If I'm in a gunfight with the enemy teammate, the ♥♥♥♥ should spawn at C, not next to me, not at A or B.

- Adding the Lachman shroud and ISO 9mm was a lazy addition; they could've been attachments for the ISO 45 and Lachman Sub, not a new gun.

- Lack of 2x xp weekends and doing a 24-hour one was dumb as ♥♥♥♥.

Pros:
- Ranked
- Weapon tuning
- Maps
- Consistent events and content
- Gunplay
- Movement after the update it got in season 4 or 5
- The number of weapons and operators

From launch till now, the game has improved, but this by far has been the most lazy and least cared for. cod I've seen this franchise for years. This game is just a cash grab. Was playing 400+ hours worth it? No, was Orion worth it? Yeah, was spending money on this game worth it? No, except for that, it carries over to MW3. This is not a game I plan on going back to. I was extremely hyped for this game because I loved the OG MW trilogy, and I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ loved MW2019, and this game being a sequel to 2019 had me hyped. but it was a huge disappointment to me. I lost a lot of trust in the infinity ward because of this game, and I am keeping my expectations low. when it comes to them for now on.",1668535976,1707451726,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The movement feels like the Verdansk days
- New features such as horizontal zips and flare guns make the game way more fun
- The map (Urzikstan) is 5 stars

- Nvidia Highlights is disabled

Of course, abusing the report system and screaming at the mic of how you should die for ""using hacks"" is completely fine and unpunished. But beware if you're even remotely good or someone just doesn't like you.

I played this COD religiously for the first 3 months of its release for camo grinding (as I do with every COD). This got me to around level 170 or whatever the max was at the time. I then decided I would took a break after getting diamond camo on everything before going for dark matter. (The camo and weapon unlock in this game is an entire god awful system that deserves its own review). Upon returning to the game a full year later I decided to hop into a game with my buddy after work for a chill music and COD session only to be greated with the worst skill based matchmaking I have ever seen. With full honesty every single player except for maybe one or two on the enemy team every single game would be between the levels of 600-900. Obviously me and my friend were getting our shit kicked in every single game usually having k/d of 40/40-60+. Every single game there would be at least two level 600+ running around with a shotgun and one-shotting everyone across the map. I would then proceed to hear the screaming of multiple 12-16 year olds absolutely cracked out on monster at the end of every single match telling me I'm dog shit because I have a job and can't invest 10+ hours a day on this video game to keep up with the sub-human evolution that these parent-less children are going through. 
Moral of the story if you do a line of coke then you might be able to compete with the absolute mongoloid community of 14 year olds that snort a line of g-fuel and down a monster before loading into their 400th consecutive game without providing anything meaningful to society.

EDIT: Took a big break from the game and decided to hop on the new one (MW3) and see if anything changed. It's actually even worse now. I haven't been in a single lobby where the entire team wasn't max level, and you'd think that maybe that would mean they are really good and moving around alot right? NOPE. Every single game is filled with people just camping in a corner. EVERY SINGLE MATCH. Not to mention the fact that they CAN'T DESIGN ANY NEW MAPS FOR SHIT. ""Let's make a map that is completely centralized around a very small portion and then make all the spawns way out the fuck in the middle of nowhere so after you die to a guy in a corner once getting to where the action is, THEN YOU HAVE TO RUN BACK THERE FOR LIKE 30 SECONDS ONLY TO DIE TO ANOTHER GUY CAMPING A DIFFERENT CORNER. Or, WELL MAKE A MAP THAT'S SO SMALL THAT WITHIN LITERAL MILI-SECONDS OF YOU SPAWNING YOU DIE AGAIN. 
The skill based match making still feels like the biggest piece of dogshit I've ever experienced. I'm trying to play casual team deathmatch with a beer after work and it feels like I'm fighting for my fucking life. The part that gets on my nerves is being the lowest level in the lobby by over 100 or 200 ranks. Like what the fuck. And these people have put that much time into this game and still don't have interstellar (the dark matter/damascus camo of this game). Like how the fuck are you level 290 you havent completed the challenges for the guns when I'M LEVEL 70, I PLAY CASUALLY, AND I HAVE IT. 

Moral of the story: they took all the worst parts of MW2 and stitched them together with black magic and sorcery to create something that should have never even been released in hell. Every minute of playing this game I can literally feel my soul dying and all happiness leaving my body for the rest of the day. If you do intend on buying and playing this game, make sure your friends get it too and only run Search and Destroy sessions with the boys. The rest of multiplayer is dogshit, zombies is dogshit and it should be illegal to even call it call of duty zombies, and Warzone 2 is almost as bad of a second coming as CSGO 2. The reason why COD is dying is because the studios are money sucking vampires that drain the life force out of everyone who has the misfortune of playing this game,

S2 MW3: Tf is this dogshit halloween skins in fucking February??? They arent even unique when all blackcell skins reuse the same glitter/drip effect.

Crossplay cant be disabled. What a lousy, lazy game.

I am so fucking sick of steam kicking me out mid game of mwz and oops oh well lost all your shit. Sorry you woke up your family over a single outburst. HAHA go fuck yourself and give us your money right? Cuck all Dollars? What if I retardedly spent that $30 (not cod points real fucking money I earn from my Actual job) is this the experience i will have after you scammed me out of my money???? Dogshit servers from a billion dollar company? You can pay that disgusting scum rapist bill cosby wanna-be Booby ""Bobby"" Kotick but not your servers? Fucking ridiculous. That room has more bugs and problems than this fucking game and the everlong schematic to keep this bullshit franchise alive.

For the actual game review, spend that $70 on a male hooker and get anally fucked because that would be more pleasing than this excuse of a game let alone DLC. MW2 shouldve been this especially since we are experiencing the SAME FUCKING BUGS THAT END THE GAME IMMEDIATELY AND KICK ME OFF THE GAME TO STEAM'S DASHBOARD ABSOLUTE TRASH. I can handle being kicked off because my internet and ISP are being stupid but the absurd amount of packet burst EVERY SINGLE GAME is insane. Then steam disconnects for less than a whole minute IMMEDIATELY back to steam despite being ingame and had a stable connection and it comes back in less than a minute. Old cods you stayed in the lobby for a reasonable 1-2 minutes, now you just INSTANTLY ""PROFILE SIGNED OUT"" AKA FUCK OFF THE GAME.

PISTOL GRIP [b] PUMP [/b] ON MY LAP AT ALL TIMES

Edit:
With the release of Modern Warfare 3, I will not be purchasing another Call of Duty game for a long time. I really did like MW2, but now that all future games have been merged (there goes your innovation, by the way) I'm forced to download a 40 gigabyte update for a game I don't own. 

I also need to wait five minutes to load into MW2 because there's no option to launch directly into it (tried clicking the EXE direct from its folder, but no luck), so I need to launch ""Call of Duty®"" (takes a while already), get an ""Update requires restart"" message, reboot the whole thing, and launch MW2.

All that because I don't want to pay $90 for the same, repackaged game that I bought in 2022. These people are even SAVING QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES, such as selecting maps, for new games only to further entice people into switching to MW3.

Not only that, they actually, somehow, MERGED THE REVIEWS for Modern Warfare 3 in with MW2's reviews, (since it's all ""Call of Duty®"" now, right?), giving the new store page an overall ""Mixed"" score, as opposed to the true ""Overwhelmingly negative"" score for MW3. I don't think that's ever been done on steam before.

I'm not the biggest CoD fan, MW2 was the first one I really stuck to since Black Ops, but it feels like the whole ""Call of Duty®"" thing has become so anti-consumer that nobody should buy their games anymore.
Why PAY $90 for a game with a shelf life of a year, that still has the terrible monetization practices of mobile games, and crossovers that dilute the whole game's identity. No, Nikki Minaj, Alucard and Messi do not belong in Call of Duty (but smoking 21 Savage is fun).

[b]The Call of Duty ""Yearly assembly line"" must be, finally, stopped. Make a game and stick to it.[/b] 

[b] No more battle passes, no more DLC gun skins, no more crossovers, no more yearly CoD, and for the love of god, stop recycling the names of past Call of Duty games.[/b] 
Modern Warfare 2 came out in 2009, and the ""Modern"" Modern Warfare 3 game is actually Modern Warfare 6.

Recycling game names wasn't cool when DOOM did it, wasn't cool when Saints Row did it, wasn't cool when you did it for MW4 (MW2019), and would you look at that, the first Mortal Kombat game just got released (Mortal Kombat 1).

Update: After the release of MW3, I can still say with absolute confidence and certainty that this game is still a cesspit full of dog shit and retardation. I got an upgrade for my computer with a 4080 and a 14900K, and do you think this game runs smooth? Nope. I get 350 FPS with rainbow graphics and it's not loading textures for at least 2 minutes after getting in game. Not to mention, they aren't even trying to make the game look new, they fucking given up, those little corporate shit fucks. Also, the gameplay is the downright fucking terrible. The movement is somehow clunkier and more unreliable than the abomination and horrific excuse for a game that was MW2 2022. Every Activison employee and Infinity Ward deserves to be called every single slur known to man kind in every single language. It's a true shame that I'm not saying slurs anymore and working on myself, but if I could, the language that would emit from my mouth would compare to the evil of Satan himself. Nothing can triumph my never ending hatred and annoyance at the pieces of shits that can barely- if not even- be called humans. This is the last COD game I'll ever purchase.

Events are uncompletable because the game refuses to track achievements.

Update 2024: Still shit. Rank reset was kinda a kick in the teeth to come back to.

2nd 2024 Update: Launch game. Get told it needs to update. Wonder why steam let me launch without updating when its set to auto update. Back out. Update. Autolaunch. Infinite loading screen. Close game. Relaunch. Gotta wait for the 24gb update that was previously downloaded to download again because the download through steam is somehow intrinsically linked to the COD app being live.

This game is probably the worst COD I've ever wasted my money on, it literally is a copy and paste of MWII and it's some how worse. there is absolutely no reason this game should have been $70 with the amount of issues it has. 

-Game is barley playable
-1 million bugs
-Has crashed crashed to the point where i have to hard reset my PC idk how many times
-Just bought the SEASON 2 battle pass and unlocked items just to be told I can't equip them due to not having the battle pass

It really blows my mind that this game has been out this long and still has an insane amount of issues some that have been there since day 1 idk what Activision is doing anymore.

Has some of the now-traditional CoD jank to it still, but in terms of overall entertainment CoD MWIII's multiplayer is a lot more fun than MWII's. Just don't bother with the campaign, by all reports it's absolute trash.

Final update: Seeing as the game still has some glaring issues (esp with spawns), and Activision's going the P2W route with DMZ, I'm bumping this back down to Not-Recommended. Fuck this game, and fuck everyone who buys the P2W DMZ-related bundles.

Update: After spending a decent amount of extra time on MWII, I can now say that it's gotten to the point where I can recommend buying it, just not for $70. Wait for a decent (by Activision standards, at least) sale first, then go for it.

As much as I enjoyed MWII, and as much as I want to recommend it, at its current state I am unable to do so. Game has a level of unpolish that would make an Early Access release blush (fair number of bugs, and IW/Activision doesn't seem to have any real sense of urgency in fixing them; safe to say the whole game should have been labeled as a Beta, not just DMZ/Warzone), the maps are of inconsistent quality (and instead of fixing them, they add SHIPMENT, the worst map in the CoD franchise by a large margin; that is not up to debate) and, most importantly and the biggest reason I'm giving this a thumbs down, the ""Skill-Based"" Matchmaking system is at least 10x as aggressive as it was in MW(2019), and just as sadistic in making sure you don't have a fun time on a consistent basis.

Will give another spin when Season 2 hits and will update the review if an update is warranted. At its current state though, spend your money on something else.",1672278859,1707342237,True,0,0,0.497362971305847168,0,True,False,False

Call of duty infinite warfare call of duty ghosts and many more bad games like that.

The single player was amazing I had a lot of fun playing it, but I didn't like the mission ""convoy"", I thought it was too long and too boring.

I tried a little bit from the co op nothing too special like modern warfare 2.

Know the fun part ""multiplayer"", call of duty modern warfare 2019 was amazing I loved this game, but for some reason it's not the same for modern warfare 2 2022!

For some reason the game didn't lunch with hardcore mod ! and a lot more mods were missing ! the gunsmith is something unique and fun but for some reason you went back from 10 attachments to 5 . (this is my own opinion) but I didn't like the  need to upgrade your gun to unlock new variant it's annoying.

So to sum-it-up the review is like that,

Singleplayer - 8/10
Special ops - 8/10
Multiplayer - 4/10 

Huge downgrade from 2019 Cod, hope to see a lot of updates soon!

All in all the game is... Ok-

(I will not recommend buying this game in full price)

i will fix my Review wan it will be BETTER!

[h2] Introduction: [/h2]
It  is a popular first-person shooter franchise that has been around since 2003. The series covers various historical and fictional conflicts, from World War II to the modern day. In this review, I will focus on the following aspects of the game: graphics, combat, players, game support and conclusion.

[h2] Graphics: [/h2]
The game features stunning graphics, realistic sound effects, and smooth gameplay that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The graphics are rich and detailed, with realistic lighting, shadows, and textures. The sound effects are loud and clear, with realistic gunfire, explosions, and voices.

[h2] Combat: [/h2]
The combat is fast-paced and dynamic, with different weapons, perks, and killstreaks to choose from. The weapons range from assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles, to rocket launchers, grenades, and knives. The perks give you different abilities, such as faster reloading, increased health, and stealth. The killstreaks reward you for killing enemies in a row, such as calling in a UAV, a helicopter, or a missile strike.

[h2] Campaign: [/h2]
The campaign mode follows a gripping story of a global conflict, with different characters, locations, and objectives.

[h2] Multiplayer: [/h2]
The multiplayer mode allows you to compete with other players online, with different modes, such as team deathmatch, domination, and search and destroy. The co-op mode allows you to team up with other players online or offline, with different missions, such as survival, spec ops, and chaos.

The game also introduces RICOCHET: Anti-Cheat, a new system that aims to prevent, detect, and ban cheaters from the online matches. However, despite these efforts, some players have reported encountering hackers who use various tools to gain an unfair advantage over others. In this review, I will discuss the multiplayer hacking problem in MWIII and how it affects the gameplay experience.

Multiplayer hacking is not a new issue in the Call of Duty series, as previous titles such as Modern Warfare II and Warzone have also suffered from cheaters who use aimbots, wall hacks, speed hacks, and other exploits. These cheats allow hackers to see through walls, aim automatically, move faster, and perform other actions that give them an edge over legitimate players. Some hackers even use tools to modify their stats, unlock all weapons and perks, and create custom lobbies with altered rules. These hacks ruin the balance and fun of the game for everyone else, as they make it impossible to compete or enjoy the match.

According to the developers, RICOCHET: Anti-Cheat is designed to combat cheating in MWIII by using a combination of client and server-side systems that evolve and grow over time. The system also uses machine learning to examine client and server data, issue account challenges, and collect and collate problem accounts for action. The system does not issue bans automatically, but rather alerts the #TeamRICOCHET team to review the suspicious behavior and take appropriate measures. The system also uses game code obfuscation and encryption to prevent hackers from reverse-engineering the game files.

However, despite these measures, some hackers have managed to bypass RICOCHET: Anti-Cheat and continue to cheat in MWIII. Some of them use private or paid hacks that are updated frequently to evade detection. Others use VPNs or spoof their IP addresses to avoid bans or create new accounts. Some hackers even claim that they cheat as a form of protest against the developers or publishers for various reasons, such as microtransactions, bugs, or lack of content. These hackers show no remorse or respect for other players or the game itself.

The multiplayer hacking problem in MWIII is a serious issue that affects the quality and longevity of the game. It discourages players from playing online or investing in the game's progression system. It also damages the reputation and credibility of the developers and publishers who claim to have a robust anti-cheat system. It is unclear how effective RICOCHET: Anti-Cheat will be in the long run, or whether it will be able to catch up with the evolving hacking methods. Until then, players who want to enjoy MWIII online will have to hope that they do not encounter any hackers in their matches.

[h2] Game Support: [/h2]
The game support is responsive and helpful, with a dedicated customer service to address any issues or feedback.

[th][h1][b] Conclusion: [/b][/h1]
Call of Duty MWIII is a great game that delivers an exciting and engaging experience of modern warfare. It is a game that will appeal to fans of the genre and newcomers alike. It is a game that deserves a high rating and a strong recommendation.[/th]

I wasn't really expecting a whole lot due to the videos I seen on YouTube and the really bad reviews. Now I don't play Multiplayer or Ranked. It is real sweaty for no reason. I only play Zombies. What I can say is Zombies is fun for me. It's challenging even though it's Warzone with zombies. The only thing I dislike about zombies is the stash system. I feel like you need more stash space rather doing the tombstone glitch. I feel like if you increase it to 30-40 you really shouldn't have a hard time debating on what to keep. Now would I pay full price for this game, absolutely not. I can care less about Ranked, Multiplayer, Warzone, and the Campaign. Buying this game for Zombies is silly in itself. In other words, I do have fun and it makes the time pass. Spend your money on how you want to spend it. The skins and battlepass are ok and cool but not worth it in my opinion. Once again, spend your money on what you want. Of course server issues do arise, I personally think developers need to make sure the servers are maintained more thoroughly and monitored, because the crashes were really brutal, knowing I had to start from scratch over and over again. Wrapping up, it's an ok game. Zombies, you really have to grind for what you have to accomplish. Multiplayer, Ranked, Warzone, and Campaign are just meh. Spend your money at your own risk.

It's just kinda boring, especially with the modern design. The guns no longer have identities, there's 10 million attachments that seem to all add up to doing virtually nothing, and I don't really have a sense of progression since the industry moved to these stupid battlepass chaos maps and tokens rather than clear unlock systems. I played pretty regularly for about a week until the novelty of being a shark never able to stop wore off. The big map are very much like Battlefield and I find those fun, but there's only like 3 so I get extremely bored of them after playing all day. Then I usually don't boot this up for a week+ after burning myself out like that. 

It's basically just a big money pit too, if you want to be actually doing anything interesting like changing your visuals, etc. I don't really get why ppl would want to pay upwards of $20 just to look weird in an otherwise 'serious' military shooter but whatever. I guess if you like Fortnite for some reason as an adult, buy this? I might be legitimately playing right now and flipping this to a recc if only they'd double or quadruple the fun 50v50 maps. But running around the same six little boxes like a hamster on a wheel  with no team play or real player interaction at all for 8 hours just isn't particularly entertaining to me in my 30s anymore. Hardcore playlist is fun for awhile but the maps just aren't designed for it like in CS. If they had 24/7 access to gungames I'd also play this a lot more.

Oh and they completely destroyed Zombies. Zero fun to be had there. Feels like the gameplay of a Steam asset flip mixed with the graphics of a high quality steam asset flip.",1707327994,1707328206,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Updated review (MW3).

Ricochet or should I say Ricoshit is the worst anti cheat I ever seen. Game is filled with cheaters. Blatant cheaters, they don't even try to hide it, from walls and aimbot to rage cheats you name it, COD has it! And they keep playing the game. But help me god if I have somewhat decent game with 12 Kills on warzone because I was Shadowbanned after that. For 2 weeks my account was under review and after that it was put in Limited matchmaking (whatever that means) for another 2 weeks where I was playing against cheaters and where people would turn invisible and have armor in multiplayer. After 5 weeks finally my account was cleared and I could play normally again. Did a couple of ranked matches with no special scores or whatsoever only for my account to be under review again. Their AC and their measures are broken and they refuse to acknowledge. You can't get in touch with them to appeal so your only option is to wait or play like that against cheaters only. 
I read that Microsoft sacked a bunch of Activision Blizzard people and while I feel sorry for those people I just wished Microsoft would just sacked all of them and just end Activision once and for all.",1668098516,1707317640,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Between the skill based match making that puts me in with all the sweatlord ranked players this game is overun with cheaters and the so called anticheat doesn't do anything to get rid of them. I fully think Activision is getting kick backs from the cheat companies, because one of the biggest cheat companies lost a lawsuit to Activision back toward the end of MW2's life cycle and after the lawsuit was over the cheat co released a plethora of cheats. I will be juming ship to Xdefiant once it is finally released and will probably play Warzone (Free to play) from time to time with my buddies. I will not however be giving Activision another dime of my money unless they make some drastic changes to their woke bs ideologies and manipulating my game play to pander to the new players to caudal them and get them to spend more money. Oh and last thing, F their AI chat censorship that sensors me when I have finally had enough of a cheater and say something to them.

When this game first released, I beat the campaign and found myself disappointed. Tried playing MP for two hours, had the sweatiest lobbies I've ever encountered, then refunded my Vault Edition purchase. (Still got a refund despite being over two hours.) A few months went by then they did the free trial weekend. IDK what happened but it felt completely different. I have having the time of my life that weekend and ended up buying the standard edition on sale for $49. Let me give a quick review of everything:

Campaign: If you are buying for campaign, you'll be super disappointed. 2/3 of the missions are these ""open world"" missions with recycled areas of Verdansk which you can complete in less than 5 mins if you just go straight for the objective. The story is also lacking a ton, a huge step down from MW2. The ending leaves in a state of ""Wait, that's it??"". The campaign is the worst part of this game and very forgettable do not buy for the story. I give it a 3/10.

Multiplayer is the best part here. All the changes and new features they've added make it feel so good. The movement is like a mid point between MW19 and MW2, and the TTK is slower. Everything flows so much better. The MP consists of remakes of all the MW2 (2009) maps (clearly meant as a DLC to MW2 2022 originally) and they play alright. They also ported over some of the MW2 2022 maps, and all the content you had in MW2 2022 carries over to MW3, something I hope becomes standard for the series going forward. The worst part is the new armory unlock system, requiring you complete daily challenges to unlock various weapons, gadgets, attachments, etc. Overall, I'd give it a 7/10 and may actually say its the most fun multiplayer of the recent CoDs.

Modern Warfare Zombies is clearly just a retool of DMZ from MW2, whoever, I think it offers a unique take on zombies. Just like DMZ, you can do a variety of objectives as you run around the now Warzone map, earning points to buy perks and pack your guns, so you can move to the tier 2 and tier 3 areas for harder enemies but better loot. You can play with a squad or turn off fill to go in solo, and you can run into other squads on the map that can assist you and possible join you. When you exfil, you keep the gear you picked up as you played and can sometimes find crafting recipes to make stuff like perks before you even jump into the map. Overall, MWZ is best described as a crossover between MW2's DMZ and BOCW's Outbreak. I give it a 7/10. I think its worth trying if you like DMZ or zombies.

My final verdict for the game in total would be a 6/10. It can be fun, but it has a lot of recycled content since it was a DLC that Sledgehammer was unfortunately forced to turn into a full game with very little time. I will recommend only if the game is on sale and only if you are interested in MWZ or Multiplayer. Campaign enjoyers can ignore this game altogether.

MW2 Review:

This game fell off so hard after launch. After I finished the season one pass, which I only finished because I started with it 50% unlocked, I pretty much did not touch it again. 

I will sing some praises for MW2. The campaign was a lot of fun, probably the best part of the game. The characters are likable and it kept me wanting to play until it was finished because I was so invested in it. Ghost is amazing and we need more of him. Additionally, I appreciate Activision implementing AI voice recognition to finally crack down on the racists and bigots that plague this game. I end up just turning of voice chat completely so I don't have to here slurs every game.   

The major flaws in the multiplayer showed up once the honeymoon phase of this game ended. SBMM is back and at its worst here. You have one, fun, well-balanced and enjoyable match? Get ready for five matches of getting pounded into the group by the sweatiest players you can imagine. It honestly makes it feel like a chore to play the game. The TTK is so high here too. You get no reaction time. Pushing is punished so hard. I feel like I get shut down all the time because I die so fast before I can even understand what is happening or before I even get the opportunity to pull the trigger. 

The game has so much potential to be amazing. The community gives feedback to IW all the time, but its like talking to a brick wall. However, turns out they did listen, but refused to change anything so they can put all the changes into MW3 and claim they listened so the sheep buy the new game. You want a fun game? Too bad, buy one of our new store bundles. 

This is all so disappointed. I got excited for a CoD game for the first time ever when MW19 was announced. Now all that hype is gone. I will not be buying a full price CoD game for the foreseeable future. I cannot recommend MW2 and I encourage others to speak with their wallets.",1667796373,1707259749,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also was a hassle to sit through all the gameplay updates that were mostly for multiplayer.  Also a pain to start up each game, having to step thru all the multiplayer menus.

They should have split off the single-player campaign to make it a stand-alone title, and just stuck to the traditional campaign elements- a wild story, interesting characters and challenging missions and equipment.

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my deep concern and frustration regarding the recent ban on my account, [Your Username]. Despite my best efforts to adhere to the platform's terms of service, my account has been banned, and I believe this action is unjust.

I have reviewed your terms and guidelines thoroughly and can confidently state that I have not violated any policies intentionally. However, I understand the importance of maintaining a secure gaming environment and acknowledge the seriousness of any breach.

To resolve this matter promptly and fairly, I plan to file a formal complaint with the State Attorney General's office. I believe this step is necessary to ensure a transparent and unbiased review of my account status. I am hopeful that this escalation will encourage a swift and thorough investigation on your part.

I kindly request an immediate review of my account and a reconsideration of the ban. I am more than willing to cooperate fully with your team and provide any necessary information to facilitate a quick resolution. Additionally, I will keep the State Attorney General's office updated on the progress of this matter.

I understand that Activision values its players and strives to provide a positive gaming experience. I trust that, with your assistance, we can swiftly resolve this issue and restore my account to good standing.

Introduction:

The events of September 11, 2001, commonly referred to as 9/11, marked a pivotal moment in contemporary history, reshaping global politics, security dynamics, and societal perceptions. The coordinated terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center towers in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., orchestrated by the extremist group al-Qaeda, had far-reaching consequences that reverberated across the world. This essay explores the multifaceted impact of 9/11 on international relations, security policies, and the socio-cultural landscape.

Historical Context:

To comprehend the significance of 9/11, it is essential to consider the historical context leading up to the attacks. Al-Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden, had declared jihad against the United States and its allies. The group operated from Afghanistan, which was under the Taliban regime at the time. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were meticulously planned acts of terrorism that aimed to provoke a global response and advance the extremist ideology of radical Islamism.

Global Political Landscape:

The aftermath of 9/11 witnessed a seismic shift in the global political landscape. The United States, under President George W. Bush, declared a ""War on Terror"" and initiated military interventions in Afghanistan and later Iraq, citing the need to eliminate terrorist threats and prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The invasions had profound geopolitical consequences, reshaping alliances and straining international relations.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) invoked Article 5 for the first time in its history, considering the attacks on the United States as an attack against all its members. This collective defense clause underscored the gravity of the situation and led to increased cooperation among NATO allies in addressing the evolving threat of global terrorism.

Security Policies and Counterterrorism Measures:

The events of 9/11 prompted a reassessment of national security policies and the implementation of unprecedented counterterrorism measures. The USA PATRIOT Act, passed shortly after the attacks, granted law enforcement agencies expanded surveillance powers, increased intelligence-sharing capabilities, and facilitated the tracking and apprehension of suspected terrorists.

Internationally, efforts to combat terrorism intensified with enhanced cooperation among intelligence agencies, law enforcement bodies, and security forces. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in the United States exemplified a comprehensive approach to safeguarding the nation against future terrorist threats.

Airport security protocols underwent a significant overhaul, with the introduction of rigorous screening procedures and advanced technologies to detect potential threats. The emphasis on intelligence gathering and information sharing became paramount in preventing terrorist activities and disrupting extremist networks.

Societal Impact and Cultural Shifts:

The impact of 9/11 extended beyond the realms of politics and security, permeating societal attitudes and cultural perceptions. The attacks generated a heightened sense of vulnerability, leading to increased public awareness and concern regarding personal safety and national security. The trauma inflicted by the visual and emotional impact of the attacks persisted in the collective memory of the American people and the global community.

Islamophobia emerged as a disturbing consequence of the attacks, with individuals of Muslim faith facing discrimination, prejudice, and racial profiling. This highlighted the importance of fostering cultural understanding, religious tolerance, and combating stereotypes to promote a more inclusive and harmonious society.

Conclusion:

The events of September 11, 2001, left an indelible mark on the world, reshaping the geopolitical landscape, transforming security policies, and influencing societal attitudes. The post-9/11 era ushered in a new paradigm characterized by heightened vigilance, increased cooperation in the fight against terrorism, and a reevaluation of international relations. As we reflect on the impact of 9/11, it is imperative to recognize the need for ongoing efforts to address the root causes of extremism, promote global cooperation, and foster a world that values peace, tolerance, and understanding.",1676870246,1707181848,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

The game is ruined., for 3 main reasons (in my opinion):

- The games SBMM is horrific and does it's best to force a 1KD. This means you cannot play with friends/gf/family members... RIDICULOUS for a 'GAME'. So either have 'fun' sweating it sat forward on your own or if you are pro/streamer in a team.
- The company has turned into a cash-grabbing board of liars. '2 years life-cycle/support' = abandoned and the worst, most unbalanced store in any game I have played.
- The worst point saved for last. The game basically doesn't run and will consistently crash. Nearly a year on, new game announced and the game is still not optimised (I have a good rig), crashes at least once nearly every time I play it and requires very specific choice of graphic settings to be selected for it to run smoothly.... which btw resets after every update... which is also every other week.",1695581901,1707140714,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Campaign:
The campaign was good, and was fun. Missions were varied and presented different challenges from each other. The stealth missions and almost puzzle like mission of guiding Ghost were probably my favorites. Its hard to pass up a good old fashion gunship raining fire down though. There were some glitches with lighting in a couple but a reset of shaders fixed that pretty quick, and i think i crashed once in the play through. Overall enjoyed it, and would recommend. More power to you if you play above hardened.

Multiplayer:
Its CoD. I like the maps and the gunplay. The community is still the community. Lots of hate for camping if you want to play sniper in the large war modes. The servers do seem to have some issues, had several friends drop connection randomly in the middle of the game. I think i have had two crashes in multiplayer so far.

Overall:
Its good, i think the price tag is probably a little high but it's still fun and a good way to blow off steam.

EDIT:
Game is a hot mess, launcher is a hot mess, devs are hot mess. There are better games to spend your time on",1669863693,1707119687,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But there are some god awful broken elements that keep me from doing so. Sadly I spent so much money on this game. Two copies and and lots of skins but after 153 hours its busted. I am so sick of being kicked from the game only to lose things I worked hard for. 3 times I beat the girl on the tower and was booted from the game while getting a gun that only drops from there. When you leave you lose everything you have. I dont play fortnite for a reason and well MW 3  recreated that experience. They are so worried about people duplicating items and glitching the game that you almost need to glitch the game to balance the game out to be fair. Honestly spending hundreds of hours to get the right stuff in zombies to be able to play the higher level content is a waste of time because by that time you are sick of the game. Seriously after all these years you think this stuff would be worked out. And while they have learned to add more content and make the game have more depth they are slapping it together and not really putting thought into it. Cheating has wrecked all MP games now days. Its either unfair and you die all the time or the devs make it so you get screwed left and right trying to play the game. Either way this game has booted me out and stolen my stuff for the last time. If its not fixed in season 2 I wont be buying another COD game. And I have been playing since the original XBOX I keep quitting every year and someone pulls me back in. But seriously I am at the end of the rope with these developers. Figure it out already. This is not your first game and on top of that its a reskin year over year for the MP so working on things like story and zombies should not be that difficult to get right. The ideas are there now just make them work. If you lose connection because of your server let the player keep there stuff, other games do. And if they are duplicating it SO WHAT. You can only stash so much anyway its not like its going to break the game. And hell I have seen more players work together and help one another in glitches than I have ever seen in games like Destiny and such so stop worrying about it. And worry about making it stable first and foremost. My god I cant even believe this is what were talking about on COD. Yes I agree these should be reviews and not a place to express gripes but gripes are the game in this case. There isnt anything to talk about unless the game runs and lets you play .

This game has drove me beyond my breaking point. So far i have accumulated approximately 284 total questions id like to personally ask an asstavision dev. If that doesnt tell you the level of anger this game will put your through then i dont know what will.

This franchise its self is one of the worst series of games ive ever played. Nothing but reused assets from WAY older titles. Nothing original nowadays. How can a game lack soo much content that was promised 2 titles ago and be so popular. How can a game have soo many game breaking bugs and issues and be so popular. 

I once thought of call of duty as a fun arcade shooter where i could laugh and have fun with friends in. Now call of duty will make you sweat your dick and balls off to just be able to compete. Youll lose 64 pounds in just 5 games of MW3.

Ok so ignore the previous review, bc its older than this one. I think what gets people so angry at COD/Activisios is the campaign. THE ENTIRE GAME IS MULTIPLAYER CENTERED. Rating this game bad for having a bad campaign is like rating Minecraft bad because you didn't get what you voted for in the mob vote. I will say the micro-transactions are bad HOWEVER, the game is not P2W. In my opinion spending money on this game only gives you:
1. The Battle Pass
The battle pass is- you know what there's no need to explain. The battle pass is a bit P2W however its not like there's very good guns/blueprints. I mean in my opinion over half the battle pass is just cosmetics.
2. Cosmetics
Like skins or weapon add-ons. Look, if you spend a lot of money on cosmetics, that's fine. What I don't like is P2W and COD/MW SERIES is not P2W

Steam comments have always been super bad/critical. However, I think the reason behind this is the huge amount of people on steam. The more people you have the more bad ones you get. Lets say you have a 1/5 chance to get a bad person on your platform. If you think about the amount of people who use steam, it becomes obvious why there are so many negative reviews on fine games.

In my opinion yes COD/MW SERIES are all good games. Good graphics, good design, not (in my opinion) P2W.

This is probably my longest, most critical, and most controversial review I've ever made. But remember people can have opinions you don't like, and that's just life.

Edit 1: I just wanted to say If I ever edit this review then it will probably be to turn off comments. Usually I'm not very serious about this stuff, this time... I was, so take this review seriously. Also sorry for not reviewing the actual game and just pointing out how negative and overly critical, and mostly wrong, steam reviews are. Hey The Stanley Parable has a whole section saying that steam reviews are bad and I can agree.

Edit 2: I don't want to sound like every other person.. and I'm gonna do a spoiler so don't ruin the campaign ending for yourself. [spoiler]WHY THE FUCK DID THEY KILL OFF SOAP IN MW3, THAT WAS EVERYONE'S FAVORITE CHARACTER.[/spoiler]",1677190425,1707098367,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Flash to now and they're selling the new MW3 DLC campaign + multiplayer for an overpriced AAA standard now of $70. I can still access MW2 content which is good, but still annoying that multiplayer for the new MW3 is behind the pay wall considering Warzone is free.


If I can ever get it to work I'd love to give this a better review, but I've spend more time fixing issues than actually playing it recently.

CoDHQ shows player counts for MWII, MWIII, and Warzone 2.0, which makes it impossible to determine which game has the most players. This allows Activision to make wild claims about MWIII's popularity and player count that no one outside the company can verify.

Additionally, CoDHQ is used as a launcher for all three games. This means that even if you only own MWII, you will be required to download and install MWIII even if you do not own or play it. If you want to play MWII, the game will launch MWIII first and you will have to manually select MWII. This will close and relaunch the game every time you switch titles.

This version has too many bugs and glitches in it. Zombie mode flashes bad and rubber bands in game. (I have Gigabit internet) so it is not my internet connection. 

Trying to play different game modes can leave you in lobby limbo and all activision seems to care about is updating their code of conduct rules every day. 

I currently cant even launch the game through steam. Game starts and then just stops for no reason. Cant seem to find a resolution for it either. 

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME........  IS MY RECOMMENDATION.

I finally got the game to launch, but there are still server issues with lag.

The appeal of MW3/2023 remains much the same as the last entry. I imagine most that enjoyed MW2019, MW2022 titles will enjoy this one, particularly with the carry forward mechanic from the last title.

While I'm typically critical of the yearly release schedule, the carry forward mechanic, allowing me to continue to use all the guns, attachments, and camos (not to mention emblems and calling cards) that I spent all that time unlocking and building loadouts for I can still use in the new game.  And with the addition of the zombies mode, there's a whole new array of camos to get with the MW2022 weapons.

On one hand, I feel like I get to enjoy all the old content on all the new maps, sometimes even old maps that they've either ported to the game fully or made available in a limited time playlist. On the other hand, it still gives me very little reason to go back to playing MW2022 unless I want to play DMZ or am feeling particularly nostalgic for the maps which hasn't happened yet.

I know for whatever reason its a big meme for people to say that COD is the same game every year, and I can get why people who aren't into this kind of style shooter would have that perception, so what does this game bring to the table that MW2022 and previous titles didn't have?

The gunsmith has been further polished, with detailed actual stats for all the attachments and how they affect the performance of the gun. No longer do we have to rely on outside sources to get us that information, or use the tuning with vague sliders. While I liked the tuning feature, I'm more than happy with things as they are now. Given all the attachments possible now, there's little need for fine tuning since swapping attachments generally does the trick.

Gunplay is fairly similar to the last title, in the best ways, but there's a bit longer time-to-kill, which slows down the pace of fights slightly, long enough that accuracy, recoil control, and maintaining a good track of your target are a much bigger deal, versus the last game which was more heavily reliant on reaction time. That being said, compared to most shooters out there the TTK is still pretty quick, so reaction time is still a big deal.

While Coop, Raids, and DMZ didn't make it into the new COD, there's now the new MW Zombies mode, which is a very welcome and fun addition. It pulls the best of previous COD zombie modes with the progression and extraction-shooter gameplay of DMZ. While other players are present now, there is no PvP in this mode which is a welcome change since late in MW2022's lifespan DMZ became increasingly subject to PvP interrupting any chance of progression, which was rather frustrating.  Zombies is a fairly chill horde shooter, giving the player a lot of freedom to choose how much challenge they want, with different tiers of difficulty on the map in the form of ""threat levels.""

The map rotation brings back a lot of old favorites from previous COD titles, and plenty of new ones as well. Honestly this current rotation feels like the strongest COD has been in a long time. At least in the 6v6 format. 

As it reaches the end of the first season, there is still not a lot of variety for Ground War and Invasion. War mode currently only has one map with another on the way in Season 2. Hopefully those get more fleshed out in the coming seasons, but currently they are a bit underwhelming compared to what they were in previous titles.

I have not played Warzone terribly much so I can't speak to much to the quality of that, since I haven't been terribly interested in the Battle Royale format since the first Warzone in MW2019.

The single-player campaign starts strong enough, but its clear the devs were under quite a time-crunch putting this together in a single year when they weren't originally planning to do a sequel to MW2022's story.  It is a far cry from the scope and climactic campaigns of the original COD4MW and CODMW2&3 games.  The story just seems underdeveloped here, and there are none of the really big ""wow"" moments the franchise was originally known for. Out of the campaigns thus far since the reboot, this one was the weakest by far. That being said, I still enjoyed it for how little of it there was, just found the conclusion rather... Underwhelming.

As for the rest, my opinion on the state of the game is much the same as it was for MW2022. Despite how much the community likes to complain, and how much the gaming community at large likes to clown on COD games, it remains one of the best fast-paced twitchy shooters on the market in my honest opinion. I am pleasantly surprised to see the game being just as good not better than MW2022, despite the dev being the same as Vanguard, which I was not a huge fan of, nor Black Ops: Cold War.

Again it's not without its flaws, and I feel like they could have a bit more time between titles to give each title a bit more room to breathe and exist before the next, but on the whole I've had a very positive experience and look forward to the coming seasons.",1692039340,1707034604,True,1,0,0.490773648023605347,0,True,False,False

Zombies is unlike any other CoD title, with it taking inspiration from DMZ, another mode from MWII, with it's design of exploring a giant map. Being able to up the difficulty with time while you go deeper through the map, and using contract type missions you can find throughout the map, as well as getting better resources/upgrades. I haven't gotten that deep into the campaign yet, but so far it has been a nice experience and has got me hooked at to what happens next. The weapon system has gotten better with armory unlocks and attachment unlocks being a lot more understandable. Movement has definitely been improved with ability to slide cancel and such, as well as a new mechanic called ""tac-stance"" which is basically like switching between a variable scope, but instead ypu flip your weapon sideways to sort of mix hipfire and aiming. overall there are lots of changes that improves the franchise, and I'd hope that they can keep that going. another important mention, you will definitely need a pretty good pc to run a game like this to the point where you can enjoy the look and feel of the game. other than that its a really good game that i think most people should give a try.",1707023633,1707023633,True,0,0,0.485829949378967285,0,True,False,False

Pro's:

Great maps
Great mechanics
Excellent performance (including flawless launch servers)
Addictive and fun (everything you expect form Call of Duty MP)
Great graphics (Not ground breaking but very solid)

Cons:

Weapon balancing (SMG's are pointless amongst other gripes). Metas surfaced very quickly.
SBMM is a dirge on gaming but it is what it is. Its savage. Team mates don't play objective etc. Opponents are gods whilst team mates are completely oblivious etc, continuously. 
No prestige system between season releases feels a bit rubbish. Bring back the old prestige system!
Kill streaks have lost their oomph. Hard to get and not half as impactful as they once were.
Price - £70 is a bit too steep for what was ultimately originally intended as DLC. Its great, but is it £70 worth of content? I doubt it. Then again, you either pay it or you are left behind.

WARZONE - Its dreadful. Boring, unbalanced, frantic, mindless, a complete tedious experience. I don't bother with it at all.

Conclusion:

Brilliant addition to COD. Its addictive, enjoyable, frustrating and just....COD.",1666989054,1706999362,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Multiplayer does not have the pace of a classic COD, Movement feels so slow. The game feels built for campers, and noobs, and maps are designed to punish anyone who wants to push & play aggressively. Worst multiplayer experience ever. Ranked mode is full of cheaters. Warzone 2 has so many bad changes and design choices. DMZ is fun. I could go on but the game doesn't deserve a longer review. The developers do not care about your enjoyment of the game. They only want your money. Do not waste your time with this game and save your money.

The fact that they don't do anything to improve or add to the genre. If you want to play it then play it, just don't expect anything new or game changing.

Summary:

Added this in case you don't want to read more below. Game sucks and only wants money in an unethical way. I would recommend other games, but they too are stuck under shitty publishers. Here are a few choices Battlefield 2042 (been fixed since release), Titan fall 2 (arguably a much better game with giant robots), Battle bit (OG devs from battlefield that created it). This is my own opinion, make your own decisions. Also, to save you some time... I will not play or given them anymore of my money.

Side note:

Why the f*ck have they not incorporated destructible environments. Hell even the game ""The Finals"" has incorporated it and well. 

Warzone:

Ironically Fortnite, Apex Legends and PUBG did it better. Sure the guns are cool, but other people did it first.

Multiplayer:

Deliberately releasing skins that are harder to spot in shaded areas. Its just as bad as when they add new guns to the battle pass that are broken as f*ck and don't balance the issue till 4+ months later. Then that very update will break the game with endless amounts of packet issues. Updates that degrade image fidelity and dropped frames. At this point I thought that this was a triple A title then why the f*ck does this feel like a shitty Indy development team that doesn't care about their product.

I think at this point a large chunk of us are like battered spouses at this point not acknowledging the fact that this won't change. So I'm going to stop playing and giving them my money.",1706986533,1706986533,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

MW2 Original Review:
Not a good launch for multiplayer/base game. Campaign was great and the availability to play early. Graphics are stunning, once you figure out the right settings. 
Multiplayer on the other hand is another story. 
-Constant crashing (10 times within an hour - doesn't include my team). Also.have to verify files afterwards. 
-No hardcore - i mean Tier 1 - mode. But wait, ""its coming."" Nothing saves - loadouts, calling cards, etc. 
-The menu is still clunky and obnoxious. Makes you click a billion times in and out to find what you are looking for. 
-Have to restart my game 3 times when I first launch in order to get things going. Needs lots of work in order to be considered a smooth game. 
-Can't see any rewards that are being used (xp) 

I will give the benefit of the doubt and wait I guess. Also. game crashed constantly and have to verify files. so far 4 times less than an hour. It's a game now who we bet will crash first. 

MW2 UPDATE review: It has come a long way since release with fixing the not being able to party, and crashing to adding hardcore (tier1) but I don't understand how games can continue to release games unfinished, and unpatched for weeks. Games still CRASHES, things still break (currently can't redeem the battle pass tokens). We've had two patches and one was for the new content release. But pretty much like the previous CODs with removing/adding new game modes, limiting the maps to those specific game modes - the usual. I don't play warzone so can't comment on that but the new mode DMZ is an interesting take (if warzone and tarkov had a baby) but toxic players and hacks everywhere you go

If you have been a die hard fan, you'll probably like it - just need to continue the patching and please, LISTEN TO YOUR PLAYERS. Still don't think it was worth $70.",1666970984,1706943447,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

I like it a lot having a PvE twist to the Warzone style map, and I fully enjoy it and have sunk a ton of time into it too, but if you want the more classic style of maps and easter eggs for zombies, you definitely want to look somewhere else. I strongly recommend the Zombies Edition of Bo3, especially with the mod tools being available on steam, if that's what you are looking for instead. Otherwise, this is a new take, and worth trying out!",1706908220,1706908220,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Should you buy this game?

Only if you've been itching to play a CoD game and haven't played in a while. I stopped playing COD after Black Ops 2. Bit the bullet on this rip-off of a game and, well... it's CoD. It's everything I expected. Although I used to enjoy the campaigns, I since became a sweaty multiplayer instead so that is what I care about. Frankly, I can't hate it too much. There's hella bugs that they should eternally be reminded and ashamed of, but it's CoD. It scratched the itch. If you bought 2019 and MW2, I wouldn't blame you for skipping this. I would have too.

Update: Now that the itch has been scratched, I can think clearly now and realize this game does not live up to the original experience.

$70 is too much for any game, let alone MW3, a game that relies heavily on recycled assets with almost no gameplay improvements outside of QoL and class customization. These things used to be given for free as updates in games circa 2010-2015 but now they slap a huge pricetag on it and call it a new entry. This isn't even an overpriced DLC, it's an overpriced ""Stuff we should have added to MW1 years ago but instead drip fed to you via 3 sets of battle pass seasons"".

The zombies mode is laughable. Every year, CoD Zombies fans ask for a new round-based mode like Black Ops 1, 2, or 3. Every time this gets strayed from, people say it sucks. The less effort put into it, the worse it is received. On the high effort, high change end, is Extinction in Ghosts, which has a cult following even now. On the opposite end is an ever increasing extreme: Black Ops 4? Panned for being too arcadey. Outbreak? No tension and recycled BR maps. Vanguard? No tension and recycled MP maps. And now this? This is Outbreak #2. Legit 90% of the playerbase in Outbreak played it because it was easy to grind XP and camos in. The same goes for MW3 zombies. Nobody will remember half the cast of MW3 zombies in 2 years. Nobody.

Multiplayer is good. But again, the leap from MW2 to MW3 here is a better customization mechanic and some QoL. Sequels should be better, this is the bare minimum. 

Campaign is terrible. Bad story, bad writing, repetitive gameplay reusing BR maps that were designed and modeled 3 years ago. There's not much to say here because there's not much content to actually discuss.


If you think paying $70 for a game with less content than games had 15 years ago is fine, and you agree with FOMO battle passes that turn games into jobs, and you like paying $20 for a single weapon skin, awesome, this game is perfect for you. Just make sure to remember your helmet when you go outside and stop eating so much glue.",1706841645,1706841645,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you liked Modern Warfare 2019 you'll definitely like this game, earned camos can be used on all weapons and it is WAY easier earning gold camos for guns in this game. I've already gotten platinum for the knife, riot shield, and all the shotguns, and earning gold for 8 assault rifles and all of the battle rifles is easy. I already have half of the smgs with gold camos, I'd recommend just playing a lot of shipment if you want to level up your guns FAST! Overall a fun experience with friends! Definitely use a controller if you can, it's a lot easier, but that might just be because I played modern warfare 2019 on xbox. Overall a solid game with a lot of free customization options that are actually good which I like a lot.

Edit: For the most part, Modern Warfare 3 has been a general upgrade to everything they had in Modern Warfare 2, however after purchasing Vault edition, which is advertised to come with blackcell, the game seems to be unsure of if you have blackcell or not. It comes with the 50 tier skips as advertised, but rather than blackcell adding anymore tier skips or none at all, the game instead doesn't let you progress past the number of tiers that would've come with blackcell. My battlepass has been stuck at tier 80 since December 22nd or so, and I've only recently managed to get it to tier 81 with a tier skip from the current The Boys event, with no further progression past that point. I'm not sure if it's like a steam issue where they didn't set up blackcell to come with vault edition so you have them separately, or if it's something to do with vault edition itself, but I'd be cautious of buying vault edition, since I have friends with normal Modern Warfare 3 that have been able to finish their battlepasses with no issue. I'd recommend the game again if they fix this issue, but until then I'd say hold off on buying it.
Edit: They fixed the battlepass issue yesterday! I was able to make progress again, which kinda sucked for having only 6 days to finish it, but I'm on tier 95 after using tier skips and zombies so it's not a big deal. And Zombies is just absolutely amazing in this game, I met a team of complete strangers that helped me through the elder sigil and got me all three of the highest tier blueprints in the game, which was very nice of them.",1673467842,1706832125,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,2,True,False,False

The multiplayer was enjoyable until you get some time in and their patented matchmaking formulas destroy your experience with no control on your end. Skill based matchmaking and engagement based matchmaking are entirely cancerous to the game and people who passionately play the game. Its worse than a casino where if you do well, you are punished and therefore basically robbed of any form of fun at every turn. Bugs and little issues are nothing compared to this sort of garbage. It makes the game unplayable after you have enough time in the game or play well enough. If call of duty is what you want. just go play the original cod 4, cod 5, mw2, or black ops. since those servers have been revived. Im not sure if they have implemented the same sort of matchmaking garbage there but its far more worth your time and money than this travesty. The Demise of the Franchise. I hope that when call of duty dies that this sort of rigged matchmaking dies with it.


Follow up,

There is another large issue with the game that has Nothing to do with pc hardware upon large in depth investigation. The game has no optimization, and eventually the game will literally force reboot your pc mid game or at menu making the game entirely unreliable and unplayable. i managed to get a couple hundred hours in before it was an issue for me. however, ranging from low end to top of the line hardware there are thousands of people online in threads trying to trouble shoot and identify a fix for this issue. Nearly all of the experts in these threads have been able to identify that it is indeed on the Call of duty side of things and there is nothing wrong or to be done on the individuals hardware. Call of duty has still not acknowledged this issue since the release and the issue has only become more prominent. Its unreal. Unfortunately as much as id like to continue playing the game. i literally cannot and its due to no error or miscalculation on my part. I truly hope they can figure this stuff out.

Another follow up.

Fixed the pc breaking issue by uninstalling every video adapter driver on the computer. which is ridiculous and was triggered by the game itself as there are threads with 1000 plus people suffering from the same thing without a fix. and still the company lies about how things work and fire large portions of their development teams. Riddled with bugs and exploits and is entirely not fair. Things like the broken aim assist doing all the work for controller players where mouse and key get nothing. They lie about skill based and engagement based functions of their game when proven that they are lying time and time again. Its sad to see. Games with the smallest of exploits like apex legends, once the studio and developers catch wind of the issue, it is the very next day that it is fixed and comes along with an entire breakdown of the issue and what was done to fix it, absolute transparency. While cod is just being made a laughing stock as they have far more resources to do this but just simply refuse and sit quietly and release a new bundle with a weapon skin hoping they just buy it and shut up. This will be the last call of duty for me. i hope the fps community will just boycott and let the franchise die so we can remember it for what it was 10 years ago.",1705594121,1706826427,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I thought this was going to be really low effort, bad and short according to release reviews but I was wrong. You can see all over the place that this was planned as an premium DLC with those combat free missions that feel really out of place, but otherwhise, it was really solid campaign compared with MW2 (2022) which had a super underwhelming singleplayer. 

I gotta recognize that Call of Duty achieved an amazing cinematics quality that are very enjoyable. This saga has one bullet more in the camber (MW4) to be seen a few years and if they wanna keep it alive, they gotta start writting a new story with new characters and let 141 rest forever without hurting the legacy of such a legendary saga for those who we've been able to enjoy the OGs back in the day and the reboots nowadays. 

I don't support this ""pay again"" strat from Activision, so, I only recommend it with 33% or 50% discount. Otherwise, skip it unless you can afford full price.

The overall experience however is NOT recommended because of the hoops and loops needed to play just one single player story campaign.

Large file download simulator ✅
Current size : 176GB
Shader optimizer simulator ✅
Application (waiting for s*** to get done) reset simulator ✅

So I downloaded 176GB again. 

Once I clicked play on Steam, I was greeted with adverts for battle pass with no actual clear way of escaping. You are taken directly to multiplayer with free battle pass active. 

Once I figured out how to escape that money pit trap, I had to deal with three EULA, that you must read lol before being allowed to click accept, what the actual F***! 

I tried to play MW2 campaign (Modern Warfare 2) which is now classed as DLC for this horrendous mess of a software package. Nope. Have to wait for the whole package to update itself, here's an idea how about you let us download the whole thing from the start so we don't have to go through all this crap, you lazy MF's??? 

After being taken back to desktop and then the software restarted itself, I had to wait for the MP shader's to finish before I could click on MW2 and then scroll to the campaign. A warning appeared saying this may take some time before you guessed it, the whole thing reset itself and I was back on Steam again. Several seconds later I'm back inside the software again, this time at the MW2 menu, now waiting for SP shaders to finish, by which point I was fed up of waiting so I quit out.

[b]WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS CRAP AGAIN WHEN I WANT TO PLAY MW3 CAMPAIGN BECAUSE ITS PART OF THE SAME F'd up package.[/b]


[b]Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 remake review.[/b]

Single player only review, because I loathe PVP.
Graphics, voices & lingo, sounds and atmosphere, very well done, 5/5 ⭐
Story/plot? good guys vs bad guys, who cares? I get to play with guns in a FPS.

Bugs.
Being told to wait for your squad that does not move, ever. 
I watched the crops grow before switching it off.

However, putting all the games (Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Vanguard, Warzone) together in a launcher you have no choice over and have to wait for shaders to optimize or the app to reset (back to desktop/steam) whilst you move around the various games/scenarios is not a good idea. 

Saying that, it's still better than having to open that crappy EA app before you click play on steam.

As a dedicated player who genuinely enjoys competitive gaming, I find it necessary to share my concerns to enlighten potential buyers about the challenges they may encounter.

The game's lack of an effective anti-cheat system has resulted in a frustrating cycle of being reported for performing well in matches, subsequently leading to recurring five-day shadowbans. It is evident that the current mechanisms in place are insufficient to discern between genuine skill and illicit activities, leaving players like myself caught in the crossfire of these arbitrary penalties.

Despite my genuine efforts to engage in fair and competitive gameplay, the constant threat of being shadowbanned has significantly impacted my overall enjoyment of the game. It's disheartening to invest time and effort into a title only to face hurdles that hinder the very essence of fair competition.

As a loyal fan of the Call of Duty franchise, I had hoped for a more comprehensive and reliable anti-cheat solution in Modern Warfare 3. However, the recurrent shadowbans have left me questioning the efficacy of the system and my willingness to continue supporting the game.

Given the ongoing challenges and the lack of assurance that this issue will be resolved satisfactorily, I cannot recommend Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 on Steam to potential buyers. Until the developers implement a more robust anti-cheat system, players may find themselves grappling with the frustrating cycle of shadowbans that diminish the joy of competitive gaming.

In conclusion, my experience with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 has been marred by the absence of an effective anti-cheat system, leading to frequent and undeserved shadowbans. Until these issues are adequately addressed, potential buyers may want to reconsider their investment in this title.",1706732160,1706732160,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That's all of the positives though. The fact that they force you to download it along Warzone is just absurd. On top of that I have a feeling (since MW 2019) that warzone gets much more attenion that the game you actually paid for. There's plenty of maps from old MW2 included in the warzone map, right there, ready to be implemented into multiplayer - but no, all we get is 10 mediocre maps that we're forced to play forever. The battlepass idea is just absurd - you pay a lot of money (on top of the base game which is also expensive af) so you can get the new stupidly overpowered guns before FTP players do. If you decide not to buy it you can get it by grinding for months after the weapons have been nerfed several times. The game just seems unfinished and doesn't get enough attention compared to warzone (WHICH I HAVENT PAID FOR AND DONT WANT). The developers just want to milk you for as much money as they can and it's getting more disgusting every new title. Shame what they did to CoD. Also the UI seems like solving a puzzle each time I want to change gamemode or weapon attachments. Don't forget the shop stuff thrown at your face each time you enter the game :)

Edit: It's got worse, I came back after a while, now I've just spent 20 minutes trying to launch Raid mode. Enter HQ. Accept new regulations. Configure settings. Unskipable cutscene.

Edit: when i say the game is decent to play i mean the ""new"" zombies gamemode that ""totally"" isn't just a re-skin from dmz and cold wars open world zombie gamemode was pretty fun to play if you had friends to play it with but it wasn't a new mode it just had a new story and a different map. the story looked nice and it was interesting to have open map missions on a call of duty game but it felt empty and short. i like the 150 hp over the cods standard 100 hp and the new movement system to help assist the player into outplaying there enemy it was very fun especially with a knife running around the map in atypical places and stabbing your foes. 

TLDR: if you get this game at a discount and you haven't played many call of duty games sure go for it, but i can't say its worth full price since its just a mw2 remaster update that was given a new name and story.

Campaign - 3 / 5
Multiplayer - 4/5

Weapons Free Mode from Campaign is a risk but for me it works, it just needs more polish, Games do Evolve but still has to respect it's roots, so Mix of Linear and Weapons Free from Campaign is a good try IMO and please make the campaign longer for the next MW atleast as long as MW 2019.

In game voice chat works when it feels like it, cannot see friends online (even when they just sent you a party invite), online game play is extremely glitchy half the time, and now due to someone's infinite wisdom, PC users are apparently required to verify their phone number EVERY time they wish to play online.

No thanks.
I play games online with my friends to have fun, not because I want to waste my time jumping through a bunch of hoops just to actually play a game I paid good money for.

Pros:
-""New"" old maps to target your nostalgia for the good days of MW2
Cons: 
-Games are either agonisingly slow or done before you know it 
-New weapons are all inferior and less fun than the MW2 weapons
-Maps somehow have also been made worse. either so cluttered you're left looking for the red dot on the screen to distinguish enemies from the environment; or so open the only thing it encourages is people to camp one spot with a sniper
-Battlepass has gone from new skin and weapons that make you better to EXCLUSIVE weapons and attachments. Trying to use a normal gun you have made vs. one from the battlepass or the store shows how ridiculous it has been modified to get better. 


Please for the love of god do not get MW3, if you want to play stick to MW2, its genuinely better. Never buying a Call of duty game after this, my nostalgia has been spent  :(",1706599163,1706599163,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Instead, the game goes based off of making it fair for everyone. I have been in many situations where I should have died in the game, but instead came out beating the other player even though they had all the advantage regarding positioning, firepower, movement, and health. However I came out beating the other player and vice versa. The developers are constantly nerfing and buffing weapons instead of allowing the player to have more control of how they play. for example, if you are a really good sniper and prefer to play with a sniper, there are times when the developers remove firepower from snipers and instead, make assault rifles more powerful than snipers. There is also this thing called aim assist that only helps controller players. Now you are forced to play the in a different manner, getting closer to the enemy. That is something that I do not agree with. I enjoy utilizing all types of weapons. However, it becomes a problem when the developers add a new weapon into the game. Sometimes you have to purchase the weapon in a bundle, or unlock it. Then you have to level the weapon up to be able to use attachments, of change the skin. The developers also constantly remove and add new game modes. This limits players because not every player enjoys all the game modes. Basically, The developers have full control of how they want everyone to play. You can not play the way you want to play. I am not the best or even close to being a pro, but I have played Call of Duty for many years now and have done some incredible things that remind me I can keep up with most players. With that being said, you can have lots of fun playing. Just remember, the game controls everything that happens. When you fight a less experienced player, it will make sure the fight is fair by providing assistance with aiming, movement, and positioning. Sometimes you can be right on target and your shots will not register. Sometimes the weapon you are using will just feel weaker all of a sudden, or your health will diminish quicker. Basically, the developers have a way of trying to please everyone by not pleasing anyone. I have been top performer in many matches, low performer, and mid performer and have seen it all. I will not recommend this game. It is not fair to those that actually have some skill. For those are new, remember, you have to learn some things before you can be competitive just like anything else in life.",1706595810,1706595810,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Multiplayer
MW3 multiplayer is a truly fun overall experience. One of the best new-age cods. If you played MW2 (2009), you'll love reliving those past memories through the remastered maps. If you're new to the maps, most are very fun and easy to understand with a few outliers. They've also added original maps throughout season 1 and are planning many more in the future. Each OG map Sledgehammer has created is leagues better than Infinity Ward has made since COD GHOSTS or MW3 (2011) Tons of guns, attachments and streaks to use to play how you want, with your own style. It's unfortunate this game has an unforgivably, terrible campaign, worst in franchise history. I believe if this game came out at 50 dollars and had no campaign, its player base would be booming. MW3 MP is what everyone wanted out of infinity wards game last year. An improvement on all fronts. Maps, Modes, Streaks, Balancing, Weapon Tuning, you name it. Truly feels like an old school MP experience. With most games having verbal interactions between players too.... If you know what I mean. Every community has something for them here. Even trickshotting has made a comeback. 

MP 9/10 without EOMM/SBMM. 8/10 with it. 

Zombies
I'm pleasantly surprised by how fun the new zombies mode is. It's a refreshing take on slaying the undead. It's replayability isn't anything to right off about but there are different challenges and a world boss to take on as of 1/29/2023. The mode shares the Warzone map Urzikstan as its fighting ground. Though, unlike Warzone, no future content/maps have been announced.

Z 6.5/10

Warzone
If you loved Warzone during the pandemic and Warzone 2 didnt resonate with you, I think Warzone 3 is worth the try. Urzikstan is your traditional larger map with plenty of POIs to loot and fight over. It has a great layout and flows pretty well. I enjoy it more than the original Verdansk.

WZ 8.5/10

Sledgehammer again delivers with an amazing Multiplayer experience held back by whoever is calling the shots at Infinity Ward or Activision. Communication with players is still franchise leading. A dev team who truly seem to care about what players want and are willing to compromise as much as they can. Unfortunately, its being reported that approx. 25% of the team has been let go. Sad to see them get blamed again for incompetent leadership and corporate greed. Its yet to be seen if XBOX/Microsoft will steer this ship out of the storm or sink with it.

What this game is failing to do is provide a fair and stable platform to facilitate this.

As of the Microsoft acquisition there have been MASS layoffs at Activision. This pretty much sums up and explains all mentioned issues above. I don't necessarily want to give grief to the individual developers of this game. But dear god the corporate business degree douchebaggery of higher ups, management, and administration at Microsoft and Activision will drive this game and series into the ground until every last penny has been milked from it. We live in a society or whatever. But Call of Duty is the perfect display of the current depressing state of capitalistic exploitation. You get to be laser beamed by casual console players (the state of rotational aim assist is almost absurd. Its necessary and I don't care to complain about it anymore but it'd be nice if it was brought back to a scale like MW19 or nerfed 22-33% but that's never going to happen because happy casual gamers = more monies!!1!111!) and script kiddies all day BUT you get a somewhat cool looking skin for $25 :DDDD.

Sbmm keeps me playing, shop items are tempting and I just can`t get enough. I think devs made this game addictive and that`s why my review is negative. I`m reinstalling.

I've reinstalled it.
After another 80 hours, I decided to revise my review. The game got even better with time. In My opinion, there are fewer cheaters. DMZ is getting more and more fun, I hope it will resemble Tarkov more in the future.
