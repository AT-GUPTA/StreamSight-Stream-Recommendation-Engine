I don’t know why, but even though the game feels great to play, videos of it definitely look janky when I watch them. For some reason it just plays better than it looks when you watch a 2 year old video on YouTube. 

Also, the ui can be a bit obnoxious and make it hard to understand the surprisingly nuanced and honestly incredibly well designed game systems which can be annoying, but the pay off on how cool some of the stuff is, is well worth it. Finally the combat is incredibly fun (think a hybrid between M&B Banner lord and Last Oasis), as a noob you may just get spammed down, but at even mid skill level it is obvious that positioning, timing, and parrying are definitely big factors. Finally the game just feels good to play. It’s just fun.

All that being said, BE WARNED THIS GAME IS NOT Solo Friendly you NEED a group/guild, furthermore the game includes a system similar to Albion of EVE where players can buy premium currency with real cash and then trade it to other players for in game money, so if that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, don’t buy this game. If you can stomach pay for convenience/slight advantage mechanics like Plex in EVE or Gold in Albion then check out this game!

You get to make friends and/or enemies and kill your neighbors.

Combat takes some getting used to, but if you are familiar with the Mount and Blade series of games then that will help a lot.

That being said, there is one major flaw that is keeping me from investing in this game. Admittedly, it's not a problem that would affect most players- but it is a simple fix that can help bring in some players. 

Within the options menu, you can change almost every keybind except for the interact key. Now I'm a weirdo and play on ESDF rather than WASD, and the default interact key is E. Because of this, every time I move I interact with whatever is in front of me and it makes for an unenjoyable experience. Even for those who don't play on ESDF, having a changeable interact key would be a nice simple change for those who don't like E for interacting.

There are also some minor changes that I would like to see. As others have mentioned, the UI is pretty cluttered and there are some parts that are in Chinese despite having English translations on. Some of the text doesn't fit within its window, and it's kinda jarring to look at- especially with a price tag of $40. 

The tattoo and beard customizations are fantastic. You can place several tattoos wherever you wish on your body, and it's nice to have scruffier/thin beard options rather than the typical giant ball of fluff that most games have. Despite that, I'm surprised that there's a lack of changing eye color. Again I know for most people this won't matter- as you'll most likely cover your head in a helmet, but I think having a bit more customization options would allow for great roleplaying potential for players wanting to join an RP focused server.

Overall, I'm excited about future development of this game- as there's not anything like it on the market. I recommend this game if you're fine with the default controls and are looking for a survival crafting sandbox while also being able to team up/fight against other players on a bigger scale (though you can also play solo if you wish) + aren't too bothered by small details being off.

Community is mostly Chinese, good luck finding a clan to join when all the local chat (in NA ""server) is in Chinese. 
Combat is pretty rough, either lag or hit boxes are way off. Attacks either hit or they don't seemingly at random. 
Resource gathering is again either laggy, interact points are off, or just clunky. 
Not everything is translated. I am assuming this is a temporary issue though... voice acting on the other hand likely will be long term. 

Things that are nice: 
Skill Trees and Crafting Trees are robust and would be fun to work through. Crafting menus are hard to navigate since it's a big list of everything you have unlocked with some filters.

Steam should be ashamed of themselves. Angela games stole code, committed copyright infringement and fraud. It was taken off of the steam store and a lawsuit was made. The court case was concluded and Angela games lost, thus proving they stole code and steam sold a stolen game and committed fraud. Although, it was very apparent Angela Games stole the code from Ark (Snail Games) at the time, it was that blatant.

Once everyone figured out they basically copy pasted the code from ark, many people, including me, issued refunds. Steam denied us, because it went over their ridiculous 2 hour playtime, 14 day mark and Angela Games wasn't actually in court yet or judgement made. There was apparently enough proof at the time to take it off steam store however... After Angela Games lost their court case, I issued another refund. I, again, pointed out how Angela games committed copyright infringement and fraud, but again, steam came up with a new excuse to not refund me. Here is what they said exactly.

""As this title was purchased in 2021 and has over 30 hours of playtime we are unable to provide a return of funds in this case. While we are happy to investigate returns for purchases that may slightly exceed the 2 hour 14-day refund requirement, this purchase too greatly exceeds refund policy for an exception.""

So, since I bought it in 2021 and have 3 hours over their arbitrary 30 hours of playtime, that means steam has zero problem with engaging in copyright infringement and fraud. I have 33.6 hours on the game and much of that, probably at least half to be honest, was spent afk with the game running in the background. My playtime shouldn't even matter when THEFT is involved.

Steam is so adamant about keeping the money they obtained through fraud and theft, that it's made me very hesitant about any purchase I've made on steam since 2021 and I've largely moved to other platforms instead, because of this, buying just a few games on steam since that,I made sure to verify were legit. Vendor is to make sure they aren't selling stolen goods and when they are and the product can even be returned in perfect condition, like a digital game license, they are supposed to issue a refund. If the vendor refuses, then it's supposed to be the merchant to take responsibility and make sure the vendor is legit and not engaging in fraud, but steam is to big for the merchant to care of course...

The only recourse now would be to file a small claims suit, but watch, if I did such a thing, steam would probably just retaliate and try to deactivate my account, like they do with charge backs. Since it's just 30$ I'm not even gonna bother and continue to just buy games elsewhere. Steam is absolutely disgusting in this. Forcing me to support literal thieves and help fund their legal defense is NOT OKAY. Supporting these practices is NOT OKAY.

The fraud was proven in a court of law. I read the judgement of what was publicly available. There is no excuse steam. None.

Because of the price hike (was $25 for EA) and the fact that they have thrown the 1.0 full release label on it, that's how I will review this game.

As a 1.0 game MoE is underwhelming at the best of times. Combat is sluggish with your character seemingly moving in slow motion for every action, NPC control is barebones, the UI might be the worst UI I've seen in a survival game, translations are missing or just plain bad. The game lacks polish to justify the $40 price tag it now has. As is right now it's a worse Conan Exiles without any magic. 

The core of the game is fine, it's an enjoyable survival game that has some neat elements. But it feels like an Early Access game that still needs a lot of little things fixed (and some big things like combat and UI). Having owned this game for 3 years now I can safely say they've made very little progress on polishing the things that a western audience will look for.

I'd be remiss to not mention that the region locking doesn't work and the chinese zergs will control most servers after the 1 week no server travel ban is lifted.

TLDR, this is still an Early Access game despite the label they added. It is NOT worth $40, but would be a good pickup in the future in the $20 range.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW FROM 2021


Pre-TLDR: Great looking Survival/Combat/Building game with a ton of potential, albeit a bit rough around the edges.

Aesthetics
Graphics: 8/10 Game looks great and runs smooth on my systems (3060Ti).
Sound: 3/10 Repetitive sounds, can't disable the random music from what I can tell.

Gameplay
Combat: 4/10 Could use a lot of tweaking. There's already an established meta (spears) and the AI can be gamed pretty easily.
AI Control: 6/10 Basic mount and blade esque command system. Functional and not overly complex.
Building: 7/10 Easy to do. The permissions system with destruction of buildings when in a group is broken/poorly implemented. Lack of furniture at this time. Lack of any kind of variety. Building on any kind of slope gets a bit wonky.
Crafting: 7/10 Lots of depth in some systems, extremely linear in others. Food is a pain in the butt to make, but armor and weapons are just linear tech lines.

Overall
5/10
Game has a ton of potential but is rough around the edges. Some things just don't have english translations at all (and other translations are a little bit off). The food system can be extremely time consuming once you have to start feeding your horses and NPC's. Bit of a lack of direction outside of the quests, but they are more of a tutorial and often times don't apply to your certain playstyle.",1637715399,1708717174,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From farming, breeding, taming, training your own warriors (soldiers), it's similar to Conan where you can recruit warriors but different that you can actually have them follow you to protect you if some other shady player decides to jump you.

Once you level up far enough, you can recruit more warriors (soldiers). In a PVP/PVE world they just let you do one or the other but this? this is on another world. . .I still can't fathom why other PVP game doesn't implement this yet.

You jump into a server thinking you're going to be pvping and surviving against other players until you start noticing the game have ""missions???"" complete missions to earn extra xp to lvl up faster. 

Once you lvl up enough and you're ready to PVE go to a hostile NPC village and bring your soldiers with you to raid. Some mission will have you do raiding. There's also mission that cycle daily that requires you to raid NPC villages for loot. 

This game is ARK/Conan/Black Desert Online/ all of the possible PVP/PVE that you can think of. 

Want to have a horse? sure just go and tame it out in the wild. Their taming mechanism is so easy, you can easily tame horses all day and just trade to lazy players.

Cons:

It's hit box does need some work, sometime killing them crazy foxes doesn't add up cause your spear will not hit them when your cross hair shows that it clearly landed that hit.

Fighting is sluggish because you're so slow but again, there's level to everything that you do such as riding horse, fishing, building, lumbering, etc. so I wonder if your proficiency in fighting is max out that you'll actually fight faster than when you first started out in the world? That's why I don't know what to put this one since I haven't gotten far yet. Let's just say it's in the pros if that actually is what the dev wanted us to do, level up our fighting skill to hit faster and move faster. It's con if none of this is true. 
It is a Chinese game, they do like the idea of cultivation on everything to get better at each specific skill set.

This game is good! trust me. You won't be disappointed. If you want to play solo you can as well since you can recruit npc warriors in a PVP/ PVE server!! no pvp game ever have player recruiting npc before since that'll crash the game with so much things happening. Yet they're able to pull it off!

1. The game has pretty much everything I want in a survival MMO and maybe Roleplay. It has Skill, Crafting, Guilts, but it goes even further too. With taming animals, stats, some very interesting servers, some skins trading, events, missions ect.
This game seems to be massive.
2. The game new map is pretty well made I can tell, and the graphics are pretty good. It seems large enough to be doing some PvE and PvP. 
3. The performance of this game is good, for at least 30 people to be playing. 
4. The animations are good enough as well as sound, its not the best but I have seen way worse than this. 
5. The community seems to be nice, both on discord and in game. 
6. This might become my secondary game apart from the hardcore survival game SCUM.
7. The company behind this game seem to be super productive. I'm surprise it actually came back after they had issues with the developers of ARK.
8. Steam Marquet for Skins! Well not everyones cup of tea, but certain a positive thing for development. 

It just need some improvements to the UI and lol, make it so English shows up a start. 

I been playing so many let downs survival recently, all from Death Matter, Fracture Veil, The Days Before, the almost there Sunkenland, No one Survive, Palworld, Dysterra, The Front.

As with all games of this genre, It's best played on private servers, and I noticed a lot of reviews review the public side of the game (the side I avoid)

solo (easiest difficulty) so far:
pros
-the missions at the start are a generic tutorial. So they have something to tell you how things work set up.
-Building is fairly simple
-You can get a horse pretty early in the game, which counteracts a slower walking pace (than I'm used to anyway)
-graphics are pretty sweet and less taxing than, say, Ark... but then what isnt as taxing as Ark xD
-im not getting mauled to death before i figured out how to fight. you attack on release which is a tad foreign to me, but It does allow you  to change the direction of a swing. not sure if you block from different directs yet or not.

cons
-Poor translations
-due to above the missions can be unclear sometimes.
-a few bugs I.E. The flashing button on on of the first missions not flashing.

Myth of Empires, an ambitious sandbox survival game developed by Angela Game, immerses players into a vast open-world where they can forge their own path through exploration, construction, and conquest. With its blend of sandbox creativity and survival mechanics, the game promises an epic adventure set in a mystical realm filled with danger and opportunity. However, while Myth of Empires shows great potential, it also suffers from several significant flaws that hinder its overall experience.

One of the most striking aspects of Myth of Empires is its expansive world. Spanning diverse landscapes from lush forests to desolate deserts, the game world feels truly immersive and invites players to explore every corner. The sense of discovery is heightened by the game's dynamic weather and day-night cycle, which not only adds visual variety but also affects gameplay mechanics such as resource gathering and creature behavior.

Building and crafting mechanics form the core of Myth of Empires' gameplay loop. Players must gather resources, construct shelters, and fortify their bases to withstand attacks from both the environment and hostile creatures. The building system offers a wide range of customization options, allowing players to create intricate structures limited only by their imagination. However, the building mechanics can be clunky and unintuitive at times, leading to frustration when trying to execute complex designs.

Combat in Myth of Empires is another mixed bag. While the game offers a variety of weapons and abilities for players to use in battle, the combat mechanics lack depth and precision. Melee combat, in particular, feels sluggish and unresponsive, making encounters with enemies feel more like a chore than an engaging challenge. Additionally, the AI behavior of hostile creatures often feels erratic and unpredictable, leading to encounters that feel more frustrating than strategic.

Despite its flaws, Myth of Empires does offer some redeeming qualities. The game's progression system, which allows players to unlock new abilities and technologies as

Looking up videos to change language. 
They were taken through old UI so I spent my first 10 minutes to exit mistakenly a couple of times and shuffling through cheap menus to find the fucking language selection. Found it at least. 

One of the main menus includes an in-game cosmetic shop.
There are popups for drops.

Created my character.
Server list is a mess. You select a map area which corresponds with a server region. 
Click quick join.
“You do not own this DLC. Please purchase the DLC first.”
They launched the game with a map dlc. A fucking map DLC. (They warned me about this in the comments, it seems like the DLC is free. Why would you warn the user using the word ""purchase"" if it's FREE? I didn't even need to check it's price because of the poor word selection.)
Try another map. 
“You do not own this DLC. Please purchase the DLC first.”
Try another.
“You do not own this DLC. Please purchase the DLC first.”
Try the last one. 
It works.

FINALLY.

“Select birth location”
Birth locations aren’t translated, all in Chinese except one.

Spawn in a grass field. The music hurts my ears. Everything looks blurry and low resolution at Ultra settings. Sound quality is disgusting as fuck, nearly unbearable. The grasses are blurry as fuck that it is literally able to hurt my eyes if I look too long.

“Select a skill you want to expertise”
Click the skill tab, click the polearm. 
Okay, I selected one? Now what? 
“SELECT A SKILL YOU WANT TO EXPERTISE”
Like… how??? 
Shuffle through quintillion menus till you learn that you need to increase the skills expertise by giving a point in the little + button at the bottom of the page…

**UPDATE
Was a lot of fun (1000+ hours) until the extended time it was taken off of steam for suspected use of coding from a different game. Too many exploits to prevent others from progressing or participating in battles due to single player guilds outbidding legitimate guilds with 30-50 players. Territories controlled by 3-4 mega guilds and not enough end-game PvE play to keep on playing.

This is one of  a dozen Zerg Fest PVP games on the market.   Like Conan you can be attacked and stripped while offline.  The different in this game is you cant hide your body like in Conan or  hide your most valuable and hard earned items off the surface like Last Oasis.  

Your body has an icon on  that glows and points it out to any online attackers.  This includes your captured and trained horses and  NPC Thralls (they call them warriors/vagrants or something like that, thralls is a Conan term).  They even copied Conan's torture method to enslave these non player controlled helpers.  So a zerg force can come in and destroy everything you have and leave you naked on the ground.  At least you are not in the desert and have to start the walk to food as in Conan so maybe that was something the devs actually conscientiously decided but I doubt it.

This  game  is not any good unless you have 15 players to help from different time zones.  You cant even keep a horse alive for 10 min  if  you are a low ranked player.. run into a boar.  The whole herd attacks you.  Your  bone armor is worthless   That is after 15 hours of play all you can make .   If you can hide out or have a group of players that  put in a lot of grinding then you can get a head, a little.  

There is a protection scheme or paying taxes to avoid death but the price requires a huge effort and single, two or three player teams cannot compete and will end up naked on the ground because that what the Chinese game market apparently likes.  The ability to completely rob you of game play efforts.  It is some sort of sadistic gaming but does not add value for player longevity.  Soon MOE will be as empty as Last Oasis or Conan servers.

For me I love the building part of the game, the risk of PVP but not risking my entirty of game play.  PVE is not the ticket because that robs the risk value of these games.

The game should be centered around the lord protecting the farmers because they want taxes and wealth.  They can fight for ownership of the realm and against other county lords but to stop the destruction of everything a player has spent his time on is not  simple and expensive protection timers.

So move along, keep hoping someone will invent a game for land like Naval Action where people of low rank have a protected area but live in a PVP world.  They can venture out when they are brave and strong enough to compete and only risk the small  local effort not the entire game.   The larger PVP struggle for dominance going on around them.   But, more hopeful for me is a game that creates a  reality sense where poor farmers or fishermen can live in the world besides the great hordes of lazy PVP players in shiny armored warriors with something else to battle over than stealing someones rice cakes.

On top of that, chinese zergs have zero restrictions in joining any region they like en-mass, utterly destroying every camp they find and moving on to a new server. even PVE servers.
They use exploits to do so.
Bring it up to the devs? people have, alot, they don't care.
If they suspect you're using exploits, you'll be banned and locked out of playing this game, even if you don't cheat or exploit & have a plethora of evidence that you don't (stream/record every time you're online)
Chinese players however, have been caught using exploits, have been recorded doing so on countless occasions.

Released in 2021 by Angela Game, Myth of Empires beckons players into a sprawling sandbox realm that's as enchanting as it is challenging. The game weaves together kingdom-building, resource management, and survival elements, creating a gaming experience that's nothing short of a royal escapade.
Visual Brilliance and Immersive Symphony: Upon stepping into the game's universe, players are greeted by a visual feast. Myth of Empires boasts eye-popping landscapes, realistic weather shenanigans, and details that make you want to high-five the developers for their meticulous craftsmanship. Throw in a dynamic day-night cycle and a soundtrack that's practically a sonic tour de force, and you've got a game that doesn't just entertain; it pulls you into its very soul.
Gameplay that Keeps You on Your Toes: Myth of Empires doesn't just hand you a sandbox; it tosses you into a wilderness where survival is an art form. Building majestic castles? Check. Brave treacherous dungeons? Double-check. The game encourages exploration that's both rewarding and, let's be honest, a bit hair-raising. The survival bit, managing resources and squaring off with mythical critters, adds a dash of spice that keeps boredom at bay.
Building Kingdoms and Making Diplomatic Waves: At the game's core lies the joy of building your empire, a task that's as challenging as it is addictive. Construct grand structures, forge alliances, and dive into a diplomacy system that’s more intriguing than a medieval soap opera. It's not just about survival; it's about thriving and outsmarting your rivals. Resource management becomes an intricate dance, and planning for potential skirmishes is like playing chess with a dragon.
Multiplayer Mayhem: The multiplayer aspect of Myth of Empires is where the fun turns into a carnival. Collaborative efforts are the name of the game – constructing colossal castles, pooling resources, and tackling mythical challenges together. Competitive multiplayer, with territorial squabbles and epic sieges, transforms the game into a rollercoaster of alliances and betrayals. It's like a digital Renaissance faire, and you've got a VIP ticket.
Conclusion: Myth of Empires doesn't just throw you into a sandbox; it hands you a scepter and says, ""Go rule!"" Its blend of kingdom-building, survival challenges, and multiplayer dynamics is a recipe for a grand gaming fiesta. Yes, the learning curve might feel like scaling a castle wall at first, but the depth and complexity of Myth of Empires turn every challenge into a victory lap.
In a nutshell, Myth of Empires is not just a game; it's a royal adventure that invites you to shape and conquer a realm of endless possibilities. So, buckle up, grab your virtual crown, and get ready for a majestic odyssey that's as fun as it is regal!",1703174046,1707154130,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just lost that spark, hadn't found anything that kept me interested for longer than a week. When this game first came out on early access.. I instantly got sunk into it. ~300 hours, before the lawsuit came. I found out it was back two weeks ago, and put another ~250 hours since then (working from home). 

This game feels like a very modernized old-school RPG. Grind-intense, open-world, community-based, slow character progression, AFK skill grinding.. The vibes it brings are very much similar to something like Ultima Online, Everquest or RuneScape. If you've played those games and enjoyed them, you'd love this game, without a doubt. People who've enjoyed less grind-intense MMOs like World of Warcraft, or survival/building open world games like Rust, Ark, etc .. you'd most likely enjoy it as well. But you'd probably want to invite friends to play with you, or join someones guild in-game. This isn't meant for solo'ing, for the average player. If you intend on solo'ing this game .. intend on pouring dozens of hours per week to see any significant progress.

This game doesn't really start opening up with more avenues of game play until you start making decent progress into your character progression. At first the game is very slow, you'll still enjoy it since there's a pretty large learning curve that stays pretty intriguing all the way through. But it isn't until you establish a good base, tons of workbenches, decent amount of skill progression -- that you finally start being able to venture out into the harder parts of the map. At first, you'll die to about anything. Within about 20 hours you'll start handling just about anything in your starting area. Depending on your play style, character skills focus, guild population, etc.. you could be exploring deep across the massive map (emphasis on massive .. probably takes an hour+ to travel from one end to the other) within 100 hours. Or, if you're solo and focused a lot of crafting skills.. you could be waiting 300+ hours before you can venture that far out into the map. Your characters level doesn't mean much .. it's the skills you've leveled that determine your characters ability. 

Overall I feel like the game is awesome, filled a void that has been missing in the gaming industry for decades.. If you're a hardcore grind-fest MMO type of guy.. This game is what we've been missing. I can't speak much on the PVP, since I've stuck to a PVE server this whole time. But -- I do plan on transfering to a PVP server after release -- with some friends. That is another cool aspect to the game .. your character isn't stuck to one server. You can transfer your character to any other server within your region. You can even establish your guild across servers, and make a base in any of them. 

There are a lot of CONS though. Most are ones easily ignored, some probably worse depending on PVP/PVE servers.
 
1. Translation. It's terrible. It's not just the wording, it's the formatting as well. In some cases there is valuable information cut off the screen, because it fit in Chinese, but didn't fit in English. So in those cases you have to switch to Chinese just to see a number you needed. Not only is the translation still needing major polishing (which I suspect they may do after the 1.0 release), there are too many instances where things are referred to as different names, depending on which screen you're looking at. A particular attribute could be called ""ABC"" in one page, and then called ""ZYX"" in another page. 

2. Server regions aren't locked. Meaning EU, Chinese, NA can all join whatever region they want. And the Chinese players take major advantage of this. The map contains areas that can be 'claimed' by your guild marker, particularly farms. And it's also advantageous to build near mines. 75% of the best spots to build your base have already been claimed by Chinese players. And once it's claimed, very unlikely they'll ever leave as you can prevent your base from decaying for 2 weeks. Major problem on PVE servers. On PVP servers -- technically you could raid their base and try and claim the land. But ... again .. since it's not region locked Chinese guilds usually established dominance on every server. So if you're playing PVP .. probably want to avoid messing with Chinese guilds. If you're playing PVE, you don't have much to worry about Chinese guilds (other than losing out on prime building areas). The game is also set up so that guilds can become ""magistrates"" or in other words ""King"" of the server. In that case they can receive taxes on all players in that server. Chinese guilds usually hold that title in every server. This game would be a ton better with region locking. 

3. Combat, it's almost there. But still feels very clunky. You can play with 4-direction combat, or 8-direction. I will say 8 direction is best, and the hit boxes are actually very well-done for direction based melee combat. Shields are broken. Literally useless, only time you actually block is if you continuously walk backwards and prevent NPCs/players from getting face-to-face with you. Once they are directly in front of you, their attacks just clip through the shield. Parrying works very well, but it's extremely difficult, as you need to parry the direction of the swing. Often times hits just don't register, although the animation/voice registers. Certain animals are still very broken in terms of pathing .. especially bears. They just seem like they're whacked out on pure Colombian snow. Movements are spazzy, they randomly go from normal pace to lightning pace.. From what I've read -- PVP is mount/polearm only. Two-hander is backup when on foot. Supposedly you can just 1 shot anything with horse/polearm. Bows/crossbows are pretty much useless at end-game levels of PVP. One handed is okay, it's fast and you can almost stunlock. But two-handers do much more damage, much more capable of AOE, and they have a special talent suited for PVP -- heal upon killing an enemy. All in all, the combat is very similar to Mount&Blade .. just a bit less polished. 

4. Music. What music. Seriously, with 600 hours of game play, I've probably heard about 1 hours worth of music. Very quiet, mind-numbingly quiet. Great for watching videos on the other monitor though. 

5. I haven't looked much into it, but it looks like ever since the lawsuit and they had to privately sell the game -- they've adopted micro transactions. Most of them seem cosmetic only. But some of them seem eerily pay-to-win with resources being purchasable. Extremely lame. Hopefully they smarten up and get rid of that. 

6. The game has virtually no helpful content online. What's out there, only really covers like 20% of the game. Most of the videos, articles, posts you see about this game just cover early level stuff. The other 80% of the game, you're a pioneer and learning things for yourself. This isn't directly a con, because some might appreciate that aspect. But if you've got a specific question about something .. chances are you aren't finding that answer. 

All in all -- amazing game. MASSIVE potential. It's currently already very much a full game, with enough polishing to be enjoyed for a long time. But if they truly focus on optimizing the game -- and not going down the silly road of over-stuffing it with new features.. they have the opportunity to create a new longstanding classic in the hardcore MMO genre.",1706764739,1706764739,True,49,0,0.812307476997375488,1,True,False,False

Buy it, seriously, support this game, support the devs. It's good, it's so good!
We play on a private server so I can't speak for official servers but theres so much good! 
-Crafting, lots of stuff to craft, there's animal pens, farming, tons of armor crafting, tons of weapons, lots of interesting materials to collect and use. There's lots of fun.
-Building is great, but it is getting tweaked from what I saw in 1.0 so I'd say definitely could use some touch ups it tends to get jenky at times.
-Combat. Probably my least favorite part of the game. While it's not bad? It uses a fave left right swing kinda system, similar to For Honor. It's difficult to get used to and sort or wonky. This is supposedly getting tweaked in 1.0 as well. Though not terrible, but not great.
-The soldier recruitment system is similar to Conan, you can knock them out or pay some to join you. They can ride on a wagon with you while you go travel across the world. You can have them farm for you, cook for you, they will ride horses next to you as well! You can have a horse army of npc's follow you as you go take over camps or simply use them to haul stuff. It's seriously one of the best thrall/minion type systems of I've seen.
I play with my husband and we love the environment, put tons of hours into the game and can't wait for 1.0! 
If you're on edge, do it, just get it! The devs have never asked for more money, put out any paid dlc's or even asked for anything throughout this whole mess, seriously support this game, you wont' regret it.",1704857409,1704857409,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From roaming the valley looking for peas to running through the snow getting jumped by snow leapards or the random tiger this game will keep you entertained.  I enjoy the taming feature and in almost every server I play I typically revert to taming and breeding animals.  This game has something for everyone i think from crafters to tamers to farmers to fighters and people in between theres is something for everyone.   Crafting is pretty straight forward and only a few items are region bound.  There is a market and its heavily used which is also very very encouraging for whatever trade you are into.  You can trade by selling weapons & armor to food and medicine, siege machines and wagons to mounts and companion/slaves.  This game does have a small RMT side to the market as well from the boxes you can buy from their website if thats what you're into,  I've used it I hope you do too.  I do believe there is progress to be made now that the game is re released and I think the old player base can pick up where it left off.

The skill trees allow a lot but aren't so overbalanced that 1 person can do everything.

The same can be done for capturing, or buying followers, and training them to do all the same skills players can do. They can be used to run all the different crafting stations in the game, allowing you to focus on other avenues. There are even skills and perks that allow you to control more followers. The various animal and fish pens also offer hours of fun collecting, and they all provide different materials needed to make armor, and weapons, and help feed other animals.

You can definitely live in your quiet village, pay your taxes and take care of your serfs but it will soon start to feel like a job. you need to pay your taxes , feed your peasants and your warriors so you will probably need to go for salt runs, mine ore daily for tools and weapons, for you and your warriors and i dont even started to mention about growing crops( if you are lucky and claim a granary you can skip this part but not entirely.  You will get tired very fast and feel like you landed into another job. And ofc you cant pvp as all the pvp is group oriented , makes no sense to go yourself alone at a siege. is far way better to divide jobs so you dont work alone all the day and wonder where the fun is . i really hope they will release a far better product in february and they improve the game in all aspects.",1703338001,1703338180,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think i have enough hours to do a short review..
This game used to be extremely good, then it went bad with the zerg, after that it went stale.. So now i hope it goes good again with full release coming soon.

Gameplay is awesome but timeconsuming.
Graphics stunning.
AI functional for the most part, but still loads of bugs and errors.
Community is there, if you search for it.
Zerg has died down a little. (Which is good)
Adjustments to PvE and PvP has been good. (Less stupid griefing and fighting on PvE servers for those that want to chill. Better chances for fighting for those on PvP servers.)

Ok so Angela Games recently addressed everything I was complaining about.  Get this they are even like banning hackers now, and my tickets are being addressed by a real person in less than 2 hours.  I’ve never had that happen in any game besides old school World of Warcraft.  So when the game gets released there will be significant changes to how you get proficiency and nobility and their will be changes to the raiding mechanics.  

Taking all that in and having a full wipe with a new map I am completely speechless to how fast Angela games addressed my complaints.  MAKE THEM TAKE YOUR MONEY. 

I’m still at a loss for words.  I’ve never seen a developer so engaged with their player base, especially since I don’t speak Chinese.  Thanks Angela Games for not forgetting NA.  Glad to play your game <3",1701628275,1702003150,True,0,0,0.635359108448028564,0,True,False,False

The game is gorgeous and its unique Asiatic theme sets it apart from its competitors. From the in-depth character creation to water and foliage, it doesn't disappoint in the graphical department. There are also a wide variety of biomes including snowy mountains, rain forests, and deserts. The enormous game map is arranged in a way that the further west you go, the more difficult it is to survive. Therefore, some of the more interesting and rewarding areas are locked behind a power gate, incentivizing you to level up your skills and master the east before taking on the west.

Myth of Empires also borrows a lot of ideas from a non-survival game; the legendary Mount and Blade. Start out getting your ass kicked by foxes with the janky ass combat system and level up your skills to take on challenging NPC bandits. Mount a horse and shove a spear through an enemy or become an untouchable horse archer (like yours truly). This is easily one of my favorite things about the game. You can also recruit your own NPC soldiers and peasants and tame various animals. 

The skill system is vast and has layers. Weapon skills, crafting skills, riding skills, foraging skills, the Runescape ""watch numbers go up"" grinder will be at home here. Spend hours mining, chopping, harvesting and hunting for resources, watching your little base grow and your skills develop.

It's a great survival game with a fresh take on the genre. I've played on a PVE NA server, so I haven't had any issues with ""massive chinese clans"" that wipe everyone out or whatever people are complaining about. You can transfer your character from server to server, so I'm not sure why that's an issue.

A) Streamline the server hosting experince.

Two years after its release into early access, Myth of Empires is heading back into wider release. This comes as developer Angela Game has settled with Snail Games and Studio Wildcard over alleged copyright violations that pushed the game off Steam and into a smaller independent release.

The lawsuit was filed back in 2021 over allegations that Angela Game had copied code and resources from Studio Wildcard’s Ark: Survival Evolved to make Myth of Empires. The legal action also led to Valve removing the game from Steam and an eventual quiet release with its own proprietary launcher and outside resources.

Snail Games, Studio Wildcard, and Angela Games have now issued a joint statement to announce settlement of all claims.

“Angela acknowledges that it caused difficulties for Snail’s business. By working together, Angela and Snail will put those difficulties behind them. Angela regrets any difficulties it caused Snail and looks forward to moving into this business partnership,” Angela Game president Yi Ling Zheng said in the statement.

Financial terms were undisclosed, but the outcome will involve Angela Game paying royalties out to Snail Games, and the studios collaborating to bring Myth of Empires back to the wider market via a re-release in early 2024. Their partnership will include PC distribution, both physically and digitally, with marketing assistance, and support. Myth of Empires will also be released on PlayStation and Xbox.

Additionally, it looks like the studios will work together collaboratively in the future too. “Angela Games will also develop a steady cadence of DLC and expansion packs for Myth of Empires, in partnership with Snail Games USA.”",1698264982,1698264982,False,3,1,0.282962232828140259,0,True,False,True

It still needs a lot of work in the areas of progression and simply mid and end-game game content but it's not completely devoid of it either like other titles in the same genre.
After playing quite a bit of Ark, Rust, and over a 1,000 hours in Conan Exiles as well as basically every other survival/war game i feel like i can safely say this is a good game and will become a great game with the non-stop updates the devs have been doing.
 
The original, out-dated post remains below if you wanna see the 180 this game pulled on me.

Warning to whoever is thinking about buying this game, the game looks nothing like the screenshots on the store page. Look it up on youtube or twitch beforehand. 

As for what i thought of it in my 1.5 hours of playtime:
Graphics, as i said previously, were not at all what i expected and quite bad, even on Ultra.
Character movement was extremely slow, even when on horseback.
Combat was kinda meh, don't try and take on a group of foxes right off the bat.
Don't expect this to be like Conan Exiles or Ark, because it's somehow worse than both of those were in EA.
The music sounded like it belongs in a 2001 game rather than modern-day. 
And of course gathering was a pain with default settings, as with all survival games. 

I sincerely wouldn't recommend playing this game in it's current state, perhaps wait a few months if you're interested.",1638047298,1640300281,True,0,0,0.412811607122421265,0,True,False,True

-Depth
-Crafting
-Building
-PvE and PvP/RvR 

Then you realize this;
-Balance Issues
-Zergs win again
-Not skill based
-Exploit skills or you can't compete in PvP
-No reason for Siege when spears can deet bases in minutes
-Cheaters already 
-Huge gap in player lvls/gear

Look I've played 12hours a day for over 250+ hours now at lvl 50. I can't compete with or even stand a chance without getting one shot vs the kids at lvl 60. They literally use one spear (meteoric) and deet entire bases with ease. They exploit their skills to max them out and seemingly play more than I do. If I don't stand a chance in PvP you won't either. New players beware you will NOT stand a chance. You must live on PvE until lvl 60 with maxed out stats before you can even think about PvP. The gap makes the game no fun. Having a single spear deet entire bases makes the siege elements mute. I can not recommend in it's current state. It needs changes that I am afraid will never come, like quelling the zergs, exploiters, and balance changes.

I stand by my original comments, its still very grindy and slow but after playing and learning more there are skills and perks available to offset this grind and slow movement. Performance and stability have improved too which is a good thing.

Original Review:
Really grindy to the point of doing the exact same thing over and over for hours on end, extremely slow running and sprinting speed too which just adds to the pain of doing anything, not very stable either, has a tendency to crash, performance wasn't too bad, but not great either (well above rec spec).

I would avoid, go play conan instead if you haven't already, its very similar except conan is much less grindy and more streamlined progression, this game is just boring and torturous to play. Plus you can't really get a good idea about the game within 2 hours so you wont get a refund.

However, there are three main reasons I would not suggest this game. 1:  The primary reason is it's decay rules for buildings. I would not mind some sort of upkeep rule, but to maintain a build you must repair it every two to three days and the cost of the repair is the same as its initial construction cost.  2:  Not enough resources in any one area. Becomes a grind almost immediately for materials. 3:  NPC / animal levels and life points too high. It should not take 1600 HP of damage to kill a deer. How do deer level again? I forgot ...  All in all I like the concept of the game and a lot of what the game has to offer.

Apperently you need to place a cage on a cart and then place the deer in that cage. If you place down a cage on the ground and set the animal to that cage you just lose that animal. Such a horrible system. Change it please or tell me how i messed up.

Update, okay i am awake now and thinking more clearly lol.

This game is very grindy, that makes misstakes very costly for you the player.
I learned the hard way how to tame deer, you need stun arrows or bolts that you need peas for to make, you need a cart and then you need to place a cage on the cart and take the cart with you to look for animals to capture while hunting. You naturally need a deer pen to place the animal in which i had and still do, the grind is real in this game and it has several limits to make this game that could be great frusterating to play.

If you join a guild or make one your self you will notice that the guild marker need to be paid weekly to protect your buildings from decay but you will have no clue how the settings works for the bloody thing and it will flash red to remind you that you are missing something.
If you dont pay in time the protection is gone and everything start to decay, over time everything will be destroyed by decay if you are not active.

If you try and get into farming you will notice your limit is three common planters, if you join a guild you will notice that you cant do farming because that limit applies to the whole guild.
Its things like those that makes me not want to recommend this game, there is so many dumb choices that makes no sense but i wont go into more details right now.

But for me personally, the cage thing, farming and how you cant pick up something you place down and the heavy grind is what annoyes me the most about this game and makes me not recommend it.

Update 2, finally got two deers and guess what the first deer died the second the very fucking second i placed the second deer in the pen, it took me forever to find deers, i kept being attacked by bears, tigers and wolves the whole fucking time, lost a cage, lost a worker and almost lost my second cage it has 50 health left, dam you game! Such a waste of time and effort all for nothing.

Update.3. so the in game chat is bugged again and some players even lost their characters during the patch, i know this because a guild member in my guild vanished and right now he is not sure if he wants to refund the game or restart on a new server. He got offered double xp for two days which is nothing really compared to everything he just lost. If it had happend to me i would be pretty angry too.

Started the game I was open and enjoyed it for about a week, tamed a few legendary npc, Big bertha did break some skullz for the blood God (God bless that woman), I joined a guild, my petty leader didn't want to leave the east safe zone, where we must all venture west for the riches, enough about that, everytime I fight an NPC the combat PvE sucks, animals do ALOT of damage despite the armour you're wearing, the enemies do a lot of damage too, now trying to block them that's the hardest part unless you got a shield and waving it around like a clown, COMBAT NEEDS A REWORK, my next part is, my horse can fall from a small drop and it literally dies, I even had a few that I was taming deciding to jump to their deaths from a waterfall, was funny though.

As for the guild stuff, I'm only allowed 5 planters in the guild and that is between all of us, so the farm has to be at the big base, so God forbid you try to setup an outpost in the west and try to live there if your guild doesnt't feel the same.

TL:DR

Combat needs rework, if you ever want to melee an npc just tame one and get them to do all your melee dirty work

AI literally has aimbot, they rarely miss a ranged attack.

Horses need to stop committing suicide from waterfalls/heights 

Guild limitations on planters need to stop

height damage reduction is needed, I can literally jump from between the 1st & 2nd story of a house and be okay, or I used to be able to when I was younger (yes I know armour is heavy)

Just go play Conan, same game, more fleshed out and combat there is a hell lot better than here.

--------------------------------------------

Okay I lied, game is too good and played for 126 hours now.

Honestly the devs are on top of it. Haven't seen a community this good in awhile  and it feels refreshing. Constant updates and fixes, always listening to the community and by far an amazing team.

Top 3 Pros:
                   1. Fantastic with friends
                   2. Vast open world with lots of hidden treasures
                   3. Can level and grind while AFK for the workin folks

Top 3 Cons:
                   1. Needs better translations, they're not horrible but needs some polish.
                   2. Server stability, during the high time hours, it can get laggy.
                   3. High learning curve, a lot is found out word of mouth or on your own.

Summary:
                Absolutely worth the money and time put in. Fantastic game and I hope to see more of folks out there! 8/10",1637469268,1638504975,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Any game with a level or skill system should never be PVP.
Combat is boring as it gets, strong attack or weak attack no combos nothing. 
Material balance is non existent. 4 Copper ingots for a sword, or 4 copper ingots for 4 arrows. 16 ore to farm just to shoot 4 times and do same damage as the copper sword.
Skills you obtain to help you get materials come way to late. By the time you get a skill to help you get more branches you need logs, always trailing miles behind your progress.
Overall same repetitive crap.
Running or Sprint, dont bother sprinting at all the speed is .0001% faster than just running, requires more energy to hold the sprint button than just hit the auto run and play candy crush on your phone.

I love Conan it is one of my favorites but Conan is super repetitive too. i would spend the first hour everyday harvesting for my fort, before even equipping a weapon, same style in this game.

Is it survival game? not really 
Is it more of an action game then? kinda
What is it then? A MMO with underlying mechanics taken from both aforementioned genres
it makes things more interesting, because they feel more real but MOE takes sharp turn towards SIM phylosophy, meaning: endless chores after infinite chores

Gameplay:
The Good: Combat, not perfect, but mostly WYSIWYG and skill based
The grind loops, the buildings, the overall feel is just right, unless...

The Bad: While overall interesting, with a'lot of activities, it is taxing and time consuming endeavour I mean the grind almost meets ARK on official settings from it's EA, endless gathering followed by making tools to gather hardly leaves any time to fun activities and those don't last very long cause you'll soon need to grind for resources to heal, fix gear and so on and so forth

The Ugly: Enemies are hard, to the point of being ridiculusly unfair, meaning you will most likely die to even-leveled mob cause he's tougher and hit's like mad truck in comparison to you, and here's the thing, they usually sit in fortified camps and have numbers on you, have fun kiting 'cause it's only method of killing anything but prey animals

Visuals:
The Good: They did some good job on optimisation, so picture is plesant with many options to tailor the experience... I'm playing on Ultra with some minor adjustments, runs well and looks well.

The Bad: With tools at their disposal... well I hope it's a EA thing and some features will be tweked and reworked, I mean between postprocess and light there is room for improvement, as good as game looks imagespace is a little dull with almost same levels everywhere at any time and that leads to...

The Ugly: Pinacle of the above - Nights - are bright like overcast days and moonlight is almost as strong as sun so there is little difference in day/night cycle, it's simply silly

So should you play it? 
Depends on what you're looking for
Like mentioned, it is not a survival game at all 
it is MMO with more advanced, real-like combat and grind loops, being as they are between skill trees and stuff to do it's not a bad game, just not a survival game
also feels like clanwars are the ultimate activity so if you're more into PVE... and get bored with grinding... it's still EA maybe there will be some mechanics introduced, I mean they shamelessly copycated thrall mechanics from Conan Exiles, Purges might be on the menu in future, who knows",1638388462,1638388462,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros:
-Fun Building
-Fun and forgiving survival mechanic
-lots of customization
-you can have recruitable NPCs
-You can play on a PVE server, then hop onto a PVP server without starting over
Cons:
-Combat is a little wonky

Survival meters are basic, which is a good thing. You mostly monitor just your food intake. No need for water, vitamins, etc. 

Tames are not outlandish. You tame horses and soldiers. There's no dinos, dragons, or anything crazy. This is a good thing. 

The alliance system is complex and probably the most interesting I've ever seen. It's a feudal alliance system based on subordination. You have an empire that's made up of kingdoms, and kingdoms that run the dukes.  This gives small to mid size clans an opportunity to maintain autonomy but be part of the bigger picture. 

Combat is directional but I'd say needs improvement. It's not as fluid as Last Oasis, Chivalry, or Mount and Blade. The weapons don't have good impact. The animations need improvement. That being said the knockdown mechanics are fun. You can knock people off their horse with a lance, shield bash someone to the ground, or kick their shield and send them to the ground. Lots of potential for the combat if they improve animations and make it more fluid.  

Building is fantastic. Tons of stuff to build, and it looks clean when it all comes together.

Let's first bring up some of the positive things:

.) The world looks gorgeous. Nothing wrong there. The map is beautiful, the characters creation has lots of options and the items and gear look for the most part very well done.
.) Controlling horses feels interesting. They are not easy to control but it gives the game a good feeling. Horses don't just stop on the spot as if hitting some brakes. They also don't turn around on the spot. The game does this very well.
.) Crafting has depth and is rather interesting. The modular house building is well done.
.) The map is big! This is amazing to me. I like big maps.
.) Animations are exceptional, especially for animals. How they move and act feels very natural and realistic.
.) Bugs are not very widespread, in this regard it is very solid for an early access title.

Then there are things, that some might like, that might still be improved on that I don't worry too much about, but that I personally don't enjoy in its current state:

.) Walking speed is what one might be used to from other survival open world games, nothing new there. Sprint speed however is extremely slow. One could argue about realism and all that, but in the end it's still a game. It's not fun feeling like a snail that has a sprinting speed only like 20-30% faster than walking speed.
.) NPCs don't do much when it comes to resource gathering. You only have a few and you cannot have your own little army. The amounts they gather is minuscule and really not worth mentioning in the overall scheme of things and its mostly a time sink. It doesn't help much when you have one of your NPCs gather ore for a dozen hours only for them to come back with a few hundred pieces. That's something you make yourself in 5-10 minutes. If you could have dozens of NPCs it might be different, but with such a low maximum, the effort just isn't worth it at all.
.) Many mechanics look like they offer a lot of depth, but they fall flat and are just made overly complicated to provide very simple things. This includes the whole nobility rank system, most of the taxes and benefit systems and most of the farming and food stuff.
.) There is no proper storage solution. You need raw materials and processed materials in all kinds of crafting stations, meaning you spread out your resources over multiple crafting stations all over the place instead of just being able to store your items somewhere and then using those stored items in some range directly to craft. The outcome is a lot of running around just dragging resources from one storage or crafting station to another.
.) Durability for tools is unbalanced to the extreme. You barely use some tools a few times before they already break. What's the point of having a horse with a cart when you can't even fill it up with a fully repaired tool?
.) Having torture devices as a means to make subordinates loyal to you is both questionable from a lore point of view, as well as very bad taste. There is no game reason to torture people. I'm neither squeamish or very worried about some cutscene where torture is implied, I'm also not worried if it makes sense in the game, for example if you have some enemy spy and want to get some information out of them. But for acquiring subordinates? That just makes no sense whatsoever. You don't torture people and then expect them to become your loyal followers. You might threathen them as a tyrant, you might torture others to intimidate them, but you don't just randomly torture someone and expect them to become loyal.

The game is still in early access and many of these things go along with balancing. The others are not bad enough to not give a recommendation. Theres a few things however that I dislike to a point where I didn't enjoy playing the game:

.) Mouse controls for the character feel horrible to the extreme. There is an insane delay of up to a second when turning around. It feels as bad as if you would be playing an FPS title with mouse acceleration turned up to the max. You cannot make precise movements, it feels clunky and unresponsive. Especially as this is a game that focuses on action combat, it makes the whole combat system garbage
.) You have no way to preview buildings that you place. You see a random light outline, that for the most part gives you no idea where the front entrance might be, how the building might look when placed. On top of that once placed, there is no time to move, turn or change it in any way, as such you can only destroy it and make a new one.
.) Combat balancing is so far off the charts that it makes fighting anything a bother. You can be level 30, with a full set of bronze armor and weapons, but a level 15 boar or wolf will still come close to killing you if they are alone, and they will massacre you if there are two. We're not talking about some legendary animal. It's your low-end run of the mill animals. That doesn't feel fun and makes no sense. A person in full leather armor with a sword not standing a chance against a wolf that cannot even bite through your armor is not very logical. Even from a game aspect, an overleveled, overgeared character shouldn't have any issues fighting a few animals if its boars or wolves. Heck even foxes kill you easily if there are 2 or 3 at the beginning.
.) There is nothing interesting to explore. The game currently feels like you run around pretty landscape, but at no point do you find anything ""new"" that is interesting or cool to see beyond appreciating the nice looks. The amount of enemies is rather small and they are all the same, other than perks there is no real reason to even explore in the first place and it feels like getting around is not only slow, even with a horse, but also pointless.

While Myth of Empires has definitely potential, and a first look is definitely interesting, especially the AI could be cool, it is not at the point currently, where I personally see it as fun to play. It feels too clunky, too unpolished when it comes to mechanics and combat and other than grinding stats and building a house, there is really not much to see when it comes to PvE. As for PvP .. with the combat controls this bad, it's not much fun either for me.",1638375969,1638375969,False,112,3,0.78923410177230835,11,True,False,True

You need hardwood from the trees just 100m away from you but it takes you longer than in real-life to cross this distance. When you start wearing light armour, or are daring enough to go for heavy armour, will slow you down so much that you'll possibly start using your horse inside your own house. Not kidding but, at times, I found it difficult to tell the difference between sprinting and walking. Even mounting to dismounting a horse is exceptionally slow and you have to wait until mid-game to unlock fast dismounting as a skill (and fast mounting comes even later).

Other cons:
(-) The game has a number of mechanics that penalise you for not playing daily (your structures will decay, your mount will die, etc. - and the ways to stop these things only give you a few additional hours before you have to log in again).
(-) Lots of missing or clunky animations during fights so you often only know that you've hit something/you have been hit because of the damage ticker on the side of your screen. 
(-) Overall, the combat system is very slow and unresponsive and does not feel like it's supposed to be a core part of the game (but it is).
(-) Still a lot of bad/wrong translations into English (likely to be fixed as part of early access).

What I liked about this game:
I believe this could be a great game for you if (1) you have at least 4-6+ hours every day to play, (2) you have a larger group of friends to play with/join a guild and are active in guild life at the same time, (3) you don't mind the exceptionally slow pace of the game, and (4) of course you are into more traditional survival games and love the overall setting of the game.

(+) Role of NPCs in this game is fantastic e.g. using them for crafting/fighting/gathering resources/etc. 
(+) I just love games where using a certain skill makes you get better at it and MoE does this incredibly well - no matter what you do, you'll get XP for doing this thing and will become better at it; from riding, to commanding NPCs, to chopping wood, and everything in between.
(+) Overall, this game has a huge amount of features packed into it which is really impressive, so I can see there being stuff to do for a long time. 
(+) The map seems very well designed and, personally, I like progressing from one side of the map to the other as you become stronger and have better equipment.
(+) I must say that there is a surprisingly low amount of bugs around for an early access game which a huge amount of features and depth.
(+) The developers seem to be quite active and listening to the game's community.
(+) I really love the setting of the game and the attention developers paid to details around weapons/tools/processes that someone living at the time would have used to do xyz.

As you can see, it's a shame that the slow pace, poor combat system, and some mechanics are a deal breaker for me as the game could otherwise have a lot to offer. I believe that some of the decisions around pace and mechanics have been made intentionally and are unlikely to be ""ironed out"" as part of early access, hence no recommendation from me.",1638177863,1638350053,False,2,0,0.512882471084594727,0,True,False,True

Runs perfectly.
Looks great.
Plays great.

You start on PVE and you move to PVP whenever you like, giving you the option to enjoy PVP without the fear of loosing all your progress by a bigger guilds raid, you just move your troops from PVE to PVP, including horses,Npcs, resources...

So much content already that ARK,Rust should be ashamed.
Awesome devs who read your minds.

In dept review:

There are tons of different work benches and buildings with awesome functions, that you can eventually make an entire town and have each building in it a core function, unlike just "" decoration "".

The guild system is really great, the authority options are plenty, and you can give specific ranks to your guild members rather then naming them your right hand, u can actually make them your right hand and assign them the authority you want them to have over the guild. There are plenty of skills and upgrades you can choose withing the guild, u can level up the guild by spending Activity points and coins Activity points are given to each member of the guild somewhat every 30 minutes according to their progress, the harder they work the more they will gain for the guild this will allow you to unlock new recipes/skills for your guild. This way you can see who is lazy and who is a hard worker and worth to be promoted. 

There are 2 buildings one called Guild Shop the other is called Fair this will allow your guild to trade with others on the server to earn more Coins or to barter items, you can also buy from NPC factions there are 6 and move one NPC factions goods to an other to sell it, Buy and sell. You can also increase your skill by spending coins, you just talk to one of the trader of a faction, it costs a lot.

There are MINES! I came across copper mines,iron mines and salt mines that are controlled by hostile NPCs this means you wont necessarily have to look for ores on mountains, but you will want to capture these mines and fight over them with other guilds. This gives so much dept to the open world PVP as you will have these crucial points on the map that you will have to control in order to stay in power, also giving you the change to starve a big guild, by attacking their farms, make them even weaker by attacking their mines. 
There are smaller farms, and also huge ones, that will boost your efficiency on feeding your guild and NPCs also you can make your own farm, but its a lot less effective.

You will want to create an animal farm, as its possible to have your own Rabbit Pen, Fox Pen, Boar Pen, Deer Pen, Wolf pen, Panther Pen, Tiger pen, and Crocodile pen. This will give you an automated income that you would originally get from skinning these animals. its Super effective and hunting is only needed early game. 

You can tame horses, there are many different types in looks and also in quality, you will be able to breed them and the result will be a better horse. 
You can Tame elephants too, and ride them to battle.
And have Rhinos too but idk if you can ride them :D

Assigns your NPCS to farm for you, to fight for you and to craft for you.... there's just soooo much more I still could not experience.... 

This game is a masterpiece so much in dept that I never seen anything like it..... The devs read your minds cause I could not think of anything that wasn't in the game already.... the content is almost infinite....

If you're familiar with the Mount & Blade franchise, you'll notice the directional combat, need for kiting NPCs, and activity-driven skill gain. If you're familiar with Conan Exiles, you'll notice the NPC system, the freeform building, and the tiered resources and recipes.

However, Myth of Empires builds on a familiar recipe by adding some new twists to the genre. The recipe unlock system is properly tiered and visually looks closer to the Civilization tech trees. There's a meta system of PvP ownership even in PvE servers, where the biggest and most aggressive guild ends up setting taxes for the entire server. The latter can be obnoxious, but it's not game-breaking.

Acquiring resources feels faster in Myth of Empires than it does in Conan Exiles, and the rate at which you acquire new recipes also seems quicker between steps.

There's an NPC management screen that makes finding your NPCs (or mounts) and checking their status very easy. This is good, because NPCs are a major part of the gameplay, since they help with crafting, defense, and exploration.

The only thing that well and truly sucks about Myth of Empires is the decay system, where if you don't login for a couple days and you don't have a guild to help out, your buildings are [i]gone[/i]. I haven't tried seeing if the Custom Server option lets you turn that off or not. If it does, then this is mostly a non-issue for PvE players. If it doesn't, then that [i]really[/i] needs to be addressed.

Even with that glaring problem, though, I give this game a hearty recommendation. It's just a lot of [i]fun[/i].",1638316833,1638316833,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[edit] After a few days of grinding on an official PvE server, glaring issues have come up that are slowing or halting progression for smaller guilds and or casual players. I planned on building a small 2x2 building near a farm plot so I could utilize the land to grow crops from time to time, but not to prevent others from doing the same. To my surprise EVERY farming plot has been walled in an gated, and since it's PVE you don't get to break down the walls or contest for the land, its first come first serve. The game CLEARLY states not to wall off resources, and considering fields show up on the map the same as mines and other things this should fall under that category by any logical thinker. This pretty much stopped me in my tracks progression wise, seeing as you need tons of flax and soybeans to make any headway on certain professions and weapons/armor, im not really sure what else to do.

The world is beautiful to look at on higher graphics settings, but you need the hardware to back it up.  Currently the game is poorly optimized, but it has only been in early access for 12 days.  I run alright (though I dip into the 40's at times 3440X1440 high settings - R5 3600x, 32 GB RAM, 5700xt) but my friend who I play with runs at 1080p (whose system is above recommended (R5 2600x, 16 GB RAM, RX 580 8 GB) can dip into single digits at times (playing on a private server with only  a handful of people) just walking near an NPC village -- and he's only running on Medium settings with shadows on low and motion blur off.  Hopefully some optimization will be a priority, even in this early stage of early access.

Character, animal models, and armor are very well done.  Tech and skill trees are fairly deep, with a separate skill and tech tree for guilds.  The game really demands you play with other people -- to level up your guild would take forever with only a handful of players both in activity points and copper coins, so be warned.  That said, you do feel you've accomplished a goal by leveling up your guild and unlocking new buildings.  There are a ton of workstations that you need to craft, way too many to comfortably put in a modest building -- so you aren't just making one base building and calling it a day, you will be building a village/town/city depending on your guild's size.  This makes selecting a good site to build on very important with access to a large array of resources and preferably fields for farming higher tier crops.

Combat needs work.  From the unerring aim of NPC archers, even the lower quality and level ones, to just some awkwardness and devastating melee ability of NPCs.  You can't just outskill them, you need to outmatch them on paper before you even fight them one on one.  While farmers are fairly easy to deal with (provided you use a shield and one handed weapons), lower tier (around 20ish level) bandits and rebels can and will wreck your face.  Once defeated, you can capture them, break them, and put them to work in your fields and workstations.  You can even assign them to defense and put them on patrol.

There are huge similarities to Conan Exiles on many levels.  Even the size, shape, and design of workstations are <cough> remarkably similar.  That said, Myth of Empires takes it a step beyond with quenching pools, etc.. for your higher level metalwork -- basically once you make it past bronze tools and weapons.

The extreme levels of Chinese censorship eek into the game and make you painfully aware of the stranglehold the Chinese government places on it's people.  Leader is censored, even though there are guild leaders in the game -- if you type something about a guild leader, parts of leader are censored out.  Anything with TW (read as Taiwan) in it will be censored, even if you try to talk about twine, which is a crafted resource you need for any number of things.

This game is remarkable for such an early stage in it's development, and I would highly recommend it IF you are well above the minimum spec, and I suggest being above the recommended requirements.",1638286253,1638293072,True,1,0,0.505988001823425293,0,True,False,True

The game seems well balanced as far as character advancement. It definitely doesn't feel ""grindy"" at all. The combat is a little strict and most NPCs are massively overpowered at first, but this encourages group activity. Or, if you're a solo player like me, it just means you need to get good first and use some solo wisdom like hiding on top of rocks to pick off animals with a bow... etc. 😉 OH, and you can recruit some of your own NPCs! A lot of games in the genre tend to make a solo player feel lonely, so the simple fact that this game actually HAS NPCs in the first place (and plenty of them) is a victory.

One thing I really love is that every crafting station you build can actually be used by your avatar, with a neat little animation and everything, and you are rewarded with extra EXP for doing so. It makes the game feel a bit more immersive than many others, and very fun IMO.

Am not a huge player of the grindy survival genre, but I loved Valheim and Mount&Blade so I thought a game that marries the two was interesting. I have friends who played a lot of Ark and they say it has a lot of that in this game, with the addition of some Kenshi recruiting/enslaving of people.

I have only played on a friends PVE server so am having a more chill time of it. Have set up a base in a picturesque spot on the right of the map which is the easy starter side and it is even more chill than Valheim as most of the animals don't attack you so you can just enjoy exploring/collecting resources unbothered most of the time.

It has a mostly very good tutorial, occasionally there are bits that aren't obvious but between me and my friends we worked them out. Some of the Chinese translation is iffy like Mounted rather than Mount prompt on your horse.

Graphics are decent, kind of like a high res Valheim, the disappointment for me is it doesn't have the dynamic lighting of Valheim so it isn't as pretty as it should be in 2021.

As I said, I am playing PVE so I can't comment on PVP which I am guessing will be the usual mixed bag for this kind of game depending on the people on the server. I have had a few bugs, but for a game of this scale in early access only a few days old it is remarkably fleshed out and stable.

I like to grab things when they are like 20 or so bucks and being worked on. If It is too buggy I typically come back later but am still glad I get them cheap. This game is surprisingly solid already. 

My only gripe is the taxation but it is an important tool. Not only does it keep the building count down by removing un populated bases through deterioration it also allows you to be out adventuring and stumble on a treasure trove of dropped materials from some long forgotten structure that collapses and dumps it's contents on the ground.  

 Combat and survival are the foundation of this game hunting gathering crafting are pivotal jobs. Durability is something to constantly monitor too because you can repair before something breaks for cheaper than making a new one. Base building is fun and the sheer amount of buildings and support structures are staggering. Get you some NPC lackeys and some IRL friends to help progress further otherwise you're gonna work hard. The grind is less an issue because EVERYTHING gives XP and you can  level skills up like in the old elder scrolls games just by doing whatever it is. I could ramble all day about why I love this game so far and am so excited to see where it goes.

PvP actually matters. Haven't heard of any crazy dupes, but who knows. Devs are incredibly responsive to issues, patching QOL and broken things(all pretty minor things) daily.  I'll take a communicative dev team with daily 30 minute downtime over new worlds' complete lack of communication and screwing up the game worse with every weekly patch any day.

I'm not a giant fan of the combat as the mount and blade style stuff has just never really hit me right, but it's serviceable enough.
I'm having a blast with crafting and gathering actually mattering unlike dupe world where the gold is made up and the economy doesn't matter.  It's nice that you are forced to specialize later game so you can't just do everything easily and need to play with other people to successfully play on a pvp server.

The one main downside is the giant chinese zerg alliance that since the game mechanics allow them to transfer their people and stuff willy nilly to whatever server they want whenever they want you are basically forced to accept just getting wiped no matter what now and again until your guild gets max level with lots of perks and NPCs to the point where they may not be able to just zerg down your base. (They are super bad at pvp so once it gets to the point where their insane amount of extra resources won't be as big of a deal it probably won't be nearly as much of an issue.)",1638242362,1638242362,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,True

Pros:
- Good character appearance customization. 
- Big amazing world you can spend hours just to explore.
- Love you can jump/change server/county (this game does it better then Atlas) and you can switch in between PvP and PvE servers as you see fit.This gives the game a interesting living world feeling to it (some countries are at war when other countries are not). 
- In depth crafting (your craft gets better as you get higher skill like higher durability on your crafted armor), it has mounts and animal breathing system and a economy/trade system.
- Honor/Rep system, which can lead to tribes and animals raide/attack you.
- Always something to do and times flies in this game for sure.
- Good talents and skill system for your char and guild perks.
- Nice building system, but it still needs some tweaking.
- Devs has regular updates and short maintenance.  

Cons:
- Laggy at times.
- Not at super fan of the combat system, but some probably dot agree with me there.
- Clunky slave/follower micromanagement system if you bring them to fights.
- As you grow you army it can feel little tedious to feed and maintain your army.
- Sadly here you find unmature kids who exploit flaws in the game like in every other game. Thanks to the kids the game was shut down for several hrs to day.

In general it feels like a solid game already at release in Early Access. I am 90 hrs into the game and I know I barley scratched the surface of this game. It other words this game has more content to offer then other triple A game has to offer which has recently been released (New World).

At least they have the audacity unlike other developer gaming companies that don't admit what they've done wrong or haven't addressed so publically. This is a company worth putting your money into if you want a game with near endless opportunities, a decent amount of grind and going from Zero to Hero. 

You actively affect the economy around you, if you want to be a no body and just a raider- ceasing opportunities on other peoples lands and territories? You can do that with yourself and buddies. 

You want to own land and be a ruler, making your way to the top through strategic decisions and attaining not only AI but player followers too? This game is for you. 

If you want an RTS aspect when controlling forces on the fly and real-time battle strategy to fight enemies without a moments notice?  This game IS for YOU. 

It is action packed, near limitless on idea generation and only you can decide how far your imagination goes and what you can do. 

Even if the game may be early access, may be a little clunky, overall for a release I haven't been impressed by a game and a genuine company behind it for years. I have been withdrawn from MMORPGs for some time now, this is one of those little diamonds among a sea of dirt that just has that glimmer of hope that restored real action packed content and always doing something for me.

If you're a veteran of the survival game genre, nothing in this game will feel particularly new or innovative. At the same time, you'll find the best mechanics from most of the other popular titles in MoE. For a game that barely hit early access, there is a downright shocking amount of depth and content.

While we have encountered a few bugs, it generally plays like a game that's been in early access for more than a year.

I mainly play on PVE server and enjoy doing my own building and crafting at my own pace. This game definitely has potential and I am excited to see what will the devs add onto the game.

Don't get me wrong at first you might have a bit of a struggle, but think of it like this. The more you do something the better you get with it. For example you may move around slow as in walk or run slow but over time you will be able to increase pace. If you not a pvper then just hop on a pve server or make your own! Even though this game advertise for pvp, don't go with just that because there is definitely pve elements. 

Something to keep in mind. If and when you get to the point of making or joining a guild. Just know you will need active players to join your guild to help you level it, yet if this is too much of a hassle? Just join one of the existing ones. Do your research on the specific guild to make sure its one worth joining because beware some guilds (which majority might have) will have it where if you build any structure and if you ""leave"" the guild or get kicked you will lose access to your stuff.  Otherwise it definitely fun to play with others who has similar mind set as you!

Cons upfront.
Slow paced game, feels like red dead redemption. I personally struggle with the slow movement
Very little information on the depth of the game, in general game mechanic info is hard to find
Base Building is wonky. its difficult to get pieces to snap together and elevation presents building issues
Occasional lag spikes and some frame rate issues
Combat system feels clunky 

Pros
The depth is incredible, not quite what eve online is but better then every other game i have played.
I love the leveling system for both your recipes and developing your character abilities.
The NPCs you can capture of hire has tremendous potential
The guild marker and territory markers offer you a ton of options to build outpost or very large bases 

In conclusion. I tend to play one game for a while and then i move on. I played conan exiles for hundreds of hours on PS4. I have played eve online for hundreds of hours. i played New world for hundreds of hours. Myth of empires will be a game i play for a very long time. It really is amazing.

I will change my review to positive if development progresses well.

Some of the poor aspects of the game at present:
- Character speed and animation speed are both extremely slow. It feels like you're wading through quicksand all the time.
- Combat is very clunky. Its like Mount & Blade combat but much slower and less reactive.
- The building system has many problems still to iron out and they severely restrict the shape of any building you can construct. This ain't quite Conan Exiles - expect to see a lot of plain square boxes everywhere.
- The game is pure sandbox. Theres nothing to do except build a base and then fight either NPCs or players for no real reason. Some people like this, but I personally like the world to feel a bit more alive and storied. Its nice to have a purpose that isn't just ""kill these people because they're there"".
- Lots of the usual quality of life aspects are missing, such as being able to craft from items in chests, or being able to move any object you've placed down (currently you have to destroy everything and rebuild).
- The game is originally Chinese and the localization (translations) is quite poor.
- Quite a few of the crafting buildings don't currently work correctly, although it is early access so this should be fixed eventually.

As I say, it is EA so if the game improves and becomes fun to play I'll revise my review to positive.",1638184266,1638184266,False,2,1,0.51327437162399292,0,True,False,True

To start, while this game is HEAVILY made for multiplayer, it CAN be a worthwhile solo survival crafting base building kind of game. The big caveat there is that you pretty much need to do a private/custom server. The drop rates and overall pacing of the game is already pretty brutal even for multiplayer focus but its heinous for solo. That seems to be the biggest complaint I see from some of the other reviews. Doing a custom server pretty much alleviates almost all of those complaints, you can adjust drop rates and such as you progress so that you never get too brickwalled. 

For pros, it's beautiful, like absolutely gorgeous at times. I also really liked the recruitment system, I just wish having more than 5 warriors wasn't locked behind a skill that's super tedious to grind up, or at least that that was one of the custom server options.

The game does have flaws. My biggest complaints being the farming system. It's SUPER detailed and I loved the concept of it, but it get's GRINDY until you're able to automate it, which is at a pretty late level. It's got a lot of great polish in some areas and a lack of polish in others, but overall I enjoyed my time in it and will likely come back either a while from now after it updates or with a larger group to try and see some of the multiplayer aspects. All together I probably only got to see a third of what the game currently has to offer, and I feel like the rest is pretty much locked behind group play. I'm not going to go into a huge amount of details about each and every nitpick of the game, because most of that has been addressed in other reviews. I'll just say that I got a good 40 hours and will likely come back to play more eventually. 

All together, if you're looking for a decent solo survival craft game with some pretty decent base building (considering it's early access) I think this fits. If nothing else put it on your wishlist and get it on sale.",1638153780,1638153780,True,1,0,0.522302150726318359,0,True,False,True

In Ark solo PVP is fun and can be achieved unlike in Last Oasis where solo player can be a lot more of a challenge or can be even unachievable.

Has a steep learning curve, but if you played ATLAS or ARK Survival, you won't have too much trouble figuring out the game. It almost feels like a copy of ATLAS in a different setting. 

I wish there was an actual helpful wiki, I like figuring stuff out on my own, but man.... I also wish there was an explanation of what different graphics settings do. Game looks a bit janky, even on 4K at high-ultra mix. Kind of feels a bit outdated as far as graphics engine goes. But it's not too bad. I am glad there is a DLSS option. I play MoE on a dedicated server as a PvE Single Player, with some boosts to make it feel more like Skyrim than Souls. What I didn't like in ATLAS that it felt unfinished as far as the PvE part goes and MoE shines in that regard. 

Looking forward where I can finally step away from the building and developing my skills into an actual warfare on a mass scale. Highly recommend the game, if you like survival, but this game on official settings is way too much grind and very long time to achieve anything, unless you are one of the people who actually don't care about real life and want to spend 40 hours in a game a week. Glad this game has an option of a dedicated server. I rent one from Nitrado and so far it's been a blast. If you do dedicated server like myself - don't forget to make manual saves of the Saved folder at least 2-3 times a day.

The first is the territory flag that you have to plant in/near your base in order to stop the continuous decay timer on any building. Without this flag your buildings lose durability every hour before quickly decaying to nothing. The problem with the flag is the radius is very small, making building anything more than 16 tiles across pointless as it will decay/disappear in no time. This problem is compounded by you only being allowed to have 2 flags total. Its further acerbated by the flag itself only lasting 2 days before you have to repair it or plant another. The server admin couldnt find a method of changing or turning this off. 

The second issue I had with the game was the threat system in place. The more you kill something, the higher your threat level becomes with them. This finally results in your becoming hostile with them in no time at all. Once hostile that group will send a raid at nighttime to you. This was a nuisance at first, then it got ridiculous when we found out you share the threat with everyone in your guild. They kill stuff and the meters go up and when nighttime rolls around and they raid, they randomly choose people in the guild to raid. I got raided for other people in the guild halfway across the maps actions.

It took about 5 minutes for them to accept me in their guild. I then packed my horse and my inventory with everything I could carry, went to the guild, donated many items and about 10 minutes afterwards, they kicked me from the guild, stole my donations and stole my home.

Deep down, I had a feeling that this would happen, because of how the game sets up guilds. Cheaters always ruin the game for everyone else. The game company can keep my $27.00 investment, as I'll just look at this as a failed gaming experience and move on. Luckily, there are thousands of other games for me to play and enjoy.

So yeah, the animations and the fights are a little bit clunky, but they are working on this I think. The horse animations (motion captured) on the other hand are incredible good and I was a rider myself. So I know how this animals move and run. 

The gameplay so far, after 27h is quite good and fluid. Base building, exploring, farming, fighting with NPCs, leveling, guildplay, all included and quiet extensive. 

Technically there are no issues for me and I didn't noticed any bugs so far.  

This title picked so many good features from known titles and genres like survival, strategy, action and constructed them in a very good manner and I hope and think the devs will constantly improve the game and maybe the human animations and surely add new stuff till release.

This game is like Conan/Atlas, not really like Rust/Ark. Combat is clunky, you do not feel impact of your blows and arrows are just hitscan. 

Graphics are again Conan-like, even on Ultra the image is very soapy, they need to add sharpening.

Other that that, it seems to be pretty ok - PvP, guilds system, base building are as they should be. But, in games like this actually to enjoy combat and enjoy world (views, details etc) is important. And here is a hitscan soapbox. When Gothic 3 had such a combat system 15 years ago, it was ok. In 2k21, to have such a system is unacceptable. And this is ultimately why I decided to give a thumbs down in the end.

Overall: 5/10 . If you still not decided whether go get it or not, ask youself one question: 
""Do you think Conan/Atlas are more or less equal(or better) in combat system and graphics than Rust and Ark?""

Graphics are acceptable, not breathtaking or gamebreaking either way.  The animations are a bit over the top, but that is also acceptable as part of the style.

The gameplay is pretty straight forward.  The UI, while complex, pretty much achieves its goal.  The saving grace for this game from others is that it has a SUPER complex tech tree and takes bits and pieces from other games like conan exiles, ark, and others of the survival genre.  There is animal husbandry, weaponsmithing and armor crafting, and even medicine that goes in depth so far as to balance toxicity levels.  It has a fantastic amount of detail and thats where I think this game shines.

The unbearable: The combat animations feel like they move at half speed, the sprinting does little to nothing to change your actual speed, the accuracy starting out doesnt even match the reticle.  I shot an arrow and it flew to the left side of my screen about 2 reticle distances away.  I'm sure it gets better as the game goes on, but it definitely needs work.  


tldr, I will probably put this game at a no for now.  It has a lot of potential and brings in a lot of chinese culture which is a breath of fresh air to see the genre from a different perspective, but at base price it is not worth it.   Perhaps if there was a good deal, or later down the line if it gets some development updates I'll change my mind.",1637985931,1637985931,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game is not made for solo playing (!)( because its too grindy and not fun in my opinion. 

Everything seems to slow: 
Walking and Running, Horse riding, Gathering Materials, Fighting, Hunting, Taming, and feeding your stomach.

The game is early access but these are all things that are made like that by design.

Every single piece of you base is decaying on its own timer (!) and breaks apart if you don't invest stone and wood to constantly repair. Wall torches in your base have all their own Slot for adding wood to trigger them for some light. These are all things that are not fun in an survival game. 

#Gathering: You cannot hold your left mouse button to mine a note - you have to click like crazy and change mouse angles while hitting on the stone to mine it - that design is terrible absolutely not fun in my opinion. 

#User Interface, Skill, Craft, Talent system: It does not make a lot of sense. Again all is based on farming endless and your character receives perma % increase bonus for farming more efficient. 

#Character models on proportions: The character creation makes females look like apes? Also what I did not like is that axe, hammer, spear and basically all tools are 5x bigger then they should be. So they do not scale well with a normal sized character.

#Conclusion: To many bad design decisions that overall make it to a game that I cannot enjoy or recommend.",1637984202,1637984202,False,9,1,0.571318924427032471,3,True,False,True

For me, the combat is the area that need most attention, Fire arrows seems very rigid, unimpactful and clunky. Arrows just feel super slow and most of the time they do not land where the crosshair indicates. 

When hunting animals for example, you are only going to get a hit if the animal is standing still or running directly at you. Once you kill an animal, it can be difficult to harvest the corpse since the hits of your we peon are so inaccurate, iv had to abandon kills just because I couldn’t harvest them, super frustrating.

The game does look nice with a decent skill tree and crafting system, it just feels rushed as it stands with no area of the game feeling smooth. There are alot of bugs in game right now also. I do like this game, but I feel it’s going to take 12months or so to get it running nice and feeling good to play.

I should add that the team behind this game are applying fixes and patches every day, which is great. Id recommend getting this game as it stands on a discount or give it few months for more fixes and improvements to come into play.

Game is good, like Conan meets Kenshi or Bannerlord. Deep mechanics, beautiful graphics, and an addicting gameplay loop. For being early access, it has hardly any bugs and runs great. Building system is already solid and allows for a lot of creativity - or simplicity, if you're into that. There is already a lot of content to play around with, and most of the game's systems are already realized.

There is an equal focus on PVP and PVE, with the ability to raid both player and NPC villages. You can play solely on PVE servers or migrate to PVP when you're ready, which will grant you more XP and resources for doing so. The Warrior system works very well - better than Conan's thralls, and it has fairly deep commands similar to Bannerlord. Each warrior also can progress their own skills and have unique starting skills and traits, meaning there's even 'replay' value in capturing/recruiting Warriors and training them up.

You can certainly buy and play this game right now, no need to wait for its full release. If you're playing solo, I would recommend joining a guild or sticking to PVE servers. If you have a few friends, you'll be perfectly fine though, but do understand you can be killed, fully looted, and raided. You can switch servers for a fee (using in-game currency, no p2w) so don't worry about joining something lower pop to get started, you can just transition later. 

Looking forward to future updates!

Update: I wanted to say that I'm pleasantly surprised by how fast the developer reacts to issues. There are multiple daily hotfixes being pushed out for optimization, bug & exploit fixes, etc. I'm not used to seeing this type of readiness from devs, and it's refreshing.

Pros :

-nice progression system
-decent graphics
-good community
-fun gameplay loop

Cons :

-translations are a little wonky
-sounds are nothing special
-some of the early combat is very hard solo until you train and have a trained+geared warrior to help

For single player on your own server, which comes with a game and which you can start before playing basically, it is also great. PVE goals come from bandits camps, cities and treasure maps. You can have an army like in Mount and Blade, max 10 by default, but apparently this can be increased on your own server.

More importantly, it sort of feels like new step - it is not just copycat of Ark or Conan, they improved progression in many ways, which is all happens on your character - so if you die, the gear you loose is peanuts in comparison to the experience and talents you keep gaining on your character.

So if you are into these types of games, it is worth it just to see these ideas for yourself.

The game looks quite nice and seems to run stable enough on my RTX2070. There are deep mechanics at play here. I'm not sure if they are too complicated though. Casual players might find this to much of a grind fest. But for now, it's a thumbs down until devs change a few things. Firstly, it's not very solo player-friendly at all. Most NPC camps have large numbers of soldiers. Fighting them is a death sentence. Maybe with a lot of time and grind spent in the game, I could level up enough and recruit more NPC warriors to fight with me. Until then, it's really just a survival game with hunting and mining. Secondly, the run speed of your character is painfully slow. Even now, I have tamed a horse, even that runs slower than what I'd expect my characters sprint speed to be. It's really getting on my nerves. Not sure if it's devs trying to pad out travel speed or what. Maybe the running speed is tied to skills you upgrade, but it's really unbalanced and needs some taming. Combat is not that good, with attacks feeling slow and clunky. They have a directional attack system, which feels odd. They should streamline the combat to feel more like games such as Assassins Creed Odyssey or even Dark Souls. It needs fast fluid combat with dodge rolls and less complicated attacks. Resources are too slow to harvest; you need so many sticks to craft stuff; I'm sick of chopping trees. I'm aware levelling skills linked to this will increase yield, but it's slow going at the early stages of the game. My review is almost a positive one, and it will be if I see changes implemented to balancing the game as I've mentioned.

While Myth of Empires does some things really well, other times it has features that are so lackluster or just boring. Let me also preface this by saying I LOVE survival games, so I've played my fair share of this genre. I've only played this game for ~20 hours and have only played on official PVE as a solo. So with that in mind, my opinion is very much that of a solo player playing on the gather/xp multipliers which the devs intended. In terms of progression, I've been able to hit level 28, which I believe the cap is 50 or so (I think)? So I've been able to experience features such as building a large base, taming soldiers, horses, etc. So let me explain what the game does right first. 

+ The amount of content, for an early access title, is HUGE. There are tons of building pieces, crafting stations, weapons, armor, etc. to unlock. To give a good example of this, I think there are 4 or so tiers of building pieces in the game (Wood, Clay, Stone, Metal) To put this into perspective, Ark: Survival Evolved released with 2 tiers.
+ The map is also HUGE. I've only explored maybe a 1/5th of the map in my whole 20 hours. There are also different biomes to encounter as well. The biomes can range from swamp, mountains, plains, rain forest, etc. 
+ To add onto the map, there are a good amount of AI camps which you can go and try and kill or capture them. There are some friendly camps as well which allow you to peacefully recruit your ""warriors"" by giving them certain items (Ex. 18 bandages, 22 raw meat, coarse leather armor). 
+ The skill system is pretty runescape-esque and diverse. You can level up woodcutting, physique, riding, etc. Each of the categories comes with their own perks you can unlock as you level up. If you love grinding, then you'll love this. 
+ The guild system is pretty interesting and in depth as well. You can level up your guild by spending coins and activity points (You get these points just by playing) on buffs that apply to everyone in your guild. There are also certain guild buildings that can be unlocked and used by your guild. Trade posts, watch towers, territory marker, etc. 
+ Game performance is pretty decent. My rig isn't the greatest either and I can run it just fine on low-medium settings at 60 FPS.

Now that the good features in this game have been outlined, let's get into the bad of the game... and there are a lot of them. 

- Myth of Empires (On vanilla rates) is so FUCKING grindy for a solo player. Honestly, this is more a me problem than anything. This game was clearly meant to play in a large group. The guild system is HEAVILY favored towards large groups (duh). Those guild buffs can be super helpful too, if you don't have them you'll be playing at a disadvantage. So if you're thinking about playing this game solo, don't. 
- There isn't much PVE content in the game. Most of your time will be collecting resources to craft new items and buildings. This is just so BORING... there is a quest system to help alleviate that boredom, but even that is boring as fuck. You'll get quests to craft XYZ item or go collect XYZ resource. I haven't seen any main quests deviate from that method. There are some exceptions but even then they're boring.
- The movement feels so slow in this game, I understand it's trying to be realistic but come on... I can't even tell the difference between my character sprinting or walking. If you want to do any sort of traveling, a horse is pretty much required. Even then, the horse still feels slow. Now with breeding and training you can upgrade your horse, but holy fuck the early game feels so boring.
- The translation in this game is very... meh. I understand the development team is Chinese. But can't you hire a translator who's competent in translating Chinese to English? It feels like they pulled some random Joe off the street who spoke English, told him to translate, and called it good. Sometimes I get the general idea of what a certain item or feature is supposed to do, other times i'm at a loss for words. Some items just aren't translated at all either, the item or item description is still in Mandarin Chinese. 
- Building on my last point, this game is so confusing at times. The MOST important parts in the game are not explained whatsoever. Which I think for a survival game is fine! Trial and error can be super fun and rewarding when you finally figure out how something should work. But in this game, it's just frustrating. You want to know how to refresh your decay timer on your flag claim so your buildings don't decay? Nope, not explained! Well how do I make ""donations"" to the Imperial court, what about selling my items? Nope, fuck you not explaining! The amount of times I've seen people ask questions in in-game chat is astronomical (Most of which remained unanswered). This makes it so much worse with a language barrier and poor translation between the devs and players of this game.
-  The combat in this game is so bad, lol. MoE's combat system reminds me of a ""For Honor"" type system where you can attack and block at certain angles (up, right, left, down). But it feels so much worse, It feels so unresponsive at times. I cannot imagine how PvP is right now, and I don't even wanna know with how bad combat is right now. 
- This game is somewhat buggy too. Items and buildings not working correctly to the music cutting out and not playing at all making it dead silent. For an early access game released a couple days ago, that's to be expected honestly. More are bound to pop up so don't be surprised. 

I could go on but I think you get the general grasp of how this game is in its current state. There is so much to talk about that it would be impossibly long to cover everything. The foundation is definitely there, which I cannot say the same about other survival early access titles out there. I also haven't been able to explore everything there is to in this game, such as the government system. That would take waaay too long, and I honestly don't want to invest more time in this game until they polish it more. If you're desperate to play a Survival MMO game with the boys or just bored at of your mind, then I'd lightly recommend it. Otherwise, I would just wait a year,two, or even three before buying it. And who knows, maybe they'll just abandon the game and leave it half-finished. 

TL;DR.  Game has a lot of content, huge map to explore, and lots of features to learn and enjoy. But it feels too half-baked to warrant any sort recommendation. Wait a year, two, or even three before buying it.",1637699061,1637822495,False,121,9,0.747392952442169189,19,True,False,True

A short take would be, go in with low expectations, even better if you have a group, and you can find the enjoyment this game offers. 

Now onto the long story:

Language - 
As you'd expect from a Chinese game, it is riddled with grammar issues, spelling mistakes and a variety of other issues, not game breaking, but still enough to slap your forehead, wondering who the hell is in charge of translations, and I do hope someone at least is.

Graphics - 
Nothing much to write home about, decent CE type graphics, though in my experience the optimisation is poor even on the low end, something I hope with time can be rectified.

Combat - 
One of the weakest aspects of this game if I am to be honest, the combat feels sluggish and unresponsive, attacks that should've landed do not, and vice-versa. Perhaps it may just be me, but if anything should be improved on first, this is where I'd start. 

Building -
Here is probably the strongest part of the game so far, lots of possibility, lots of tech and building, best with a group no doubt, but you still have the option to go at it alone, at least in PvE. 

Sound - 
Another part which I find to be disappointing, sounds play like MP3 files in the background rather than from the environment, which makes walking through the world, jarring and not as enjoyable as it should've been. 

Overall, despite its many glaring issues, I do not feel like any of them are unfix-able, perhaps difficult but not impossible. 
Only time will tell if this will truly rise to what it offers, or if it falls to the wayside like many other ambitious titles, for I o' so hope that this does not take the same path as Tiger Knight.",1637812285,1637812285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The core system is there, but it just feels so inconsistent, janky, and unenjoyable. Blocking the direction you want only works like 25% of the time. Same goes for attacking directions. Overhead attacks are non-existent which leaves just spam slashing with swords and spam jabs for spears. PVP and PVE combat just consist of kiting while spam attack because of the broken block system.

In addition, balancing is way off in this game. You cannot solo anything in this game besides bunnies and deers until around level 30 with T4 gear. T3 armor (bronze) is useless because anything will still 4-5 shot you. In order to progress your combat stats, you will need at least a group of 3 other people with you who are geared to aggro switch.

However, the other aspects of the game are fantastic and very in depth. The crafting, building, farming, skill, talent, nobility, guild are all very fleshed out. There is loads of progression to obtain and things to do. The  guild ownership of counties is a very unique idea, and works pretty well in a game like this.

Myth of Empires is a game that is very flawed and nearly unplayable with it's base combat system but shines in other aspects of the game. It had a very stable launch that plays very well. Will be thumbing up because I like the game's vision, and systems. Would only recommend if you can get past the combat system, and enjoy what else the game has to offer.

UPDATE: After playing longer, the combat system is not as bad as I thought, but still needs loads of work. I also appreciate the devs being so active and addressing issues in a timely manner.",1637361724,1637807140,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

On top of that, despite what others may say, the game is still new, so updates are being pushed CONSTANTLY (for instance on 11/23, servers were offline ever 30-45 minutes for some sort of patch fix, update, etc..) 

Where MoE really shines, is the RPG elements that they've added to survival-craft. Your character levels up, and yeah, you learn new recipes, etc..BUT, you also have skills that you level up, as you play. These skills range from combat, all the way to life sim, with bonus' along the way. The gear isn't as simple as ""I made a course leather armor set"" you can improve your gear both through items, and stats. It's easy to feel like ""I've MADE my character"" rather than, I made my equipment/base. Two characters at the same level may perform VERY differently, for instance, if one gets to level 50 through life skills/crafting/building, versus someone who get's there through combat. Your level is an indication of HOW MUCH you've done, not WHAT you've done.

Some key features:
Warriors - Just like slaves in Conan, you can either recruit warriors, or capture them, and break their spirit. They could all have unique skills, and rarity, so not all slaves are the same.
Skills/Stats - Almost every action you do, is tied to a skill of some kind, weapon skills, crafting skills, gathering skills, leadership skills, etc.. This is what I was talking about above, where, depending on playstyle, you will very clearly be better in one area or another.
Leadership - You can realistically lead a band of warriors into battle. Warriors that you've ecuipped, and built their stats and proficiencies. You can even raise their specific ability and/or, you leadership ability. You also have the option of controlling their formation and attacking methods. I could take 2 tanky warriors, and 3 ranged warriors, or all tanky, or all ranged, the versatility is so engrosing here!

Cons:
It's still new, which means bugs, glitches, patches, etc.. HOWEVER, the devs are on top of things with this one. They're responsive to the community (via discord) and quick to release fixes!
Combat is...awkward. That's being generous..I know this game is new, and could see a LOT of polish, but that being said, they really seem to want to go with something unique in that regards. Sadly, it tends to be awkward, and clunky for the majority of the game.

TLDR;
Cross server raiding, great atmosphere, visually appealing, wonderful progression / customization. Awkward combat, base building is often ugly due to no flat terrain anywhere, and still receiving constant patches and updates.

It's worth the buy, if not now, then at least in a week or so!",1637790540,1637790540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It hasn't crashed so far.
The game is also optimized.
I really liked the GUIs, the possibility of you hiding or expanding almost everything is amazing!
I'm playing on my own dedicated server hosted by me so you can host yours yourself and it's working great.
There are some known bugs in dedicated servers, but the development team is working on fixes for both the game and the dedicated server. They are doing a good job of it too.

The only thing I missed was the lack of thirst. You have to eat, but you don't have to drink.

The support from both the developers and the community is also very good. They are receptive and participate in discussions.

At first I have an excellent impression, which I haven't seen in alpha games for quite some time.
I haven't tested much of the game yet, but everything I've done so far has worked perfectly.

Existem alguns bugs conhecidos nos servidores dedicados, mas a equipe de desenvolvimento está trabalhando em consertos tanto para o jogo quanto para o servidor dedicado. Eles estão fazendo um bom trabalho nisso também.

A única coisa que senti falta foi a falta sede. Você tem que comer, mas não precisa beber.

O suporte tando pela parte dos desenvolvedores como da comunidade também é muito bom. São receptivos e participam das discussões.

Pros: 
- Great multiplayer game
- Amazing graphics, weather system
- Huge buildings, walls/gates to create
- Survival system
- Hunting, Gathering and Crafting system is great
- Combat system is enjoyable, can be exploited right now but its early access
- Quick maintenance
- Devs are open about patches and applied quick

Cons:
- Servers are a bit high ping
- Animals can be exploited and killed pretty easily
- A few bugs which are being fixed quite quickly
- Have had a few graphical issues pop up (multiple people have had the same issues)
- Flag/Boundary system needs a little work/love

Overall the game is worth the investment, you can play Solo but its not recommended, get into a house/community and build from there, lots to do and its just early access. This game already is far more optimized than other games that are released or still in early access (for years..)

Rest of the game is ok, but everything you do is going towards getting better gear for you and your troops for them to be stronger at battle, so if the combat part is bad doesn't matter if the rest is ok.

First Translation issues, then you cannot simply make your own game, you have to create a server, which means you either need to have a PC good enough to do this, or, rent / buy a dedicated server. After you have your server set up, there is also no guarantee that the server will even save your progress. I am on character number 7 now, all because randomly, out of now where, server DC, wipes everything, start again. I am now a pro at getting to level 20. The typically answers to fit these issues are not there either. You can google it, but all you get is Age of Empires, or go on their website which will either not have the answer, just tell you to submit a ticket that gets dropped inot the void, or just hope your Mandarin is better than mine. Once the game works, it is kind of fun, a few clunky mechanics here and there, building is a nightmare as you can rotate the object or construction as much as you want, the moment you click build it reverts back to the original position and congrats on wasting materials, and time. 

Playing is public game server is about as fun as the China sounds. It is just pure obnoxious. 

It has been a while since we have had a half way decent Sandbox Survival, which is why I think this has gained a lot of attention, but between clunky servers, having to make your own servers, standard mechanics and just more of the same crap, this will be dead in a month. 

Oh, and the combat. I thought Darks Souls made it annoying. Try this. My god, you can be stood on top of the enemy, clearly swing through the darn things head. . . Nothing. Swing and a miss. After 12 hours, I have honestly had enough, the moment you start having fun something happens to drag you back to the reality of Tencent or their subsidiaries never being able to make a fully functioning good game.

Short Review :

Game Trailer : Wage war, march with 1000 strong force, siege huge castles..
Actual Game : Cut trees, break stones, cut grass..repeat...

Long Review :

I have played a lots of games in this survival pvp/medieval genre. I have played ARK and MnB Series for more than 2000 hours each. So I was a hell lot of excited and optimistic for this release.

Good things here : 

1) Huge. A lot of things to do and explore for. Lots of crafts to check for and the tech tree is just never ending. 
2) The idea/concept of this game is great. It gives a total simulation of the real medieval life. (Combination of good games like Mount and Blade, ARK, Medieval Dynasty etc.)
3) The medieval setting (The areas, mountains, rivers, NPC bases etc.) looks really amazing (though graphics wise I didn't find is appealing)

Bad things here (Here the list will go on and on...) :

1) Graphics is not upto the mark. The details are very crude. The trees, leaves and objects 
    looks lack luster. ARK was released 9 years prior to this game and that has much better 
    looking graphics than this game (ARK looked more asthetic, this infact having better 
    graphics looks dull).
2) Gameplay seems exciting but feels boring after few hours. There are lots of content to 
    explore in this game (mostly during the late game as it seems). But the start is too slow. 
    Character upgrade or tool upgrade doesnt bring more
    impact on the speed of the gameplay. 
    Does pressing the Shift key brings any difference to the character speed for anyone ? :P 
    The character never runs.
3) Too much grinding is there. To make a medium size base you need to waste hours of 
    playtime (I still could not complete). Would have been better if they have at least added 
    features to make the warrior/recruit
    to bring basic resources like wood, grass, branch, stones etc.",1637493910,1637758395,True,0,0,0.506578922271728516,0,True,False,True

There is a reason the developer stream spends 90% of it's time looking at the inventory or moving extremely slow, if he was forced to run anywhere you would see how badly optimized this garbage is and how dead the landscape is. Even on a very high end machine like mine, this ""game"" has the worst frame rate I've ever seen the moment you turn up the graphics. This product seems exactly like a chinese knock off of Conan Exiles with none of the polish or content, and all of the grind. The UI is a confucian nightmare of primitive paintings and garish color combinations that seem more at place in a second rate massage parlor than a game. The gameplay itself is like a day at a factory in shenzen, and much like a day at a chinese factory, the only way out is to end it all the moment you realize what you are doing with your life.

combat is slow.. clunky, it has directional attacks but its pointless they are not needed at all. blocking doesn’t work. enemies have infinite stamina and do not stop swinging so you cant survive any combat. you cant outrun them to even go heal either. no matter what you, or they are wearing for gear. they all have throwing items and never miss so there is no dodging it. you cant even run and dodge.  gear doesn’t matter. you do the same damage with any weapons. armour doesn’t provide different protection at all as bronze, you still die in 4 hits in combat. bandages are the only way to heal. you cannot tie enemies up to capture them so you have to keep going into combat again with them before you get them back home. and they can still end up killing you because they are just way to over powered.. movement is so slow.. and i mean SLOW.. the camera.. you are very limited at zooming out.. FoV doesn’t exist. you cannot do anything solo but farm grass trees and rocks... horse combat shouldn’t be a thing as it doesn’t work, arrows miss as you have to stop moving. but by the time you shoot the arrow the enemy is on you, go to far and they walk off... spear never hit.

huge red and green text at the top of the screen that you would see in extremely budget games that are about 15 years old.. chat is broken so you cant even talk in game.

and a lot more....

character customisation is the best thing about this game. that’s it unfortunately.

I played the beta solo and have just started on a PvP server with a guild. For me, the game runs smooth as butter, like legit 144 FPS, but I havent got into a large scale fight or been somewhere with a giant player built city/fortress yet.

If you want PvE and solo, you can have a lot of fun just building a little settlement on a PvE server, farming, fishing, raising horses and hunting etc. It is incredibly in depth as well with lots of skill trees, perks, crafting items and tiers. You can meet other PvE players and team up to clear the numerous Hostile NPC settlements and camp in the are. You can recruit npc warriors and have them battle alongside you and they actually have mount and blade controls for this, formations, move commands, switch weapon type etc. There really is a lot to do and fun to be had whether you like PvP or PvE.

Yes, its grindy, but that is a theme of these games. Yes there are giant zergs as well. Again, its part and parcel of these games which aare designed for large scale battles and sieges.

You can tell they have really put a lot into this. For me it comes down to this, have they improved on the recipe?

What I found instead were many players admitting to problems, many of them similar crashes, yet admitting to up voting this game, and encouraging others to do so, here on Steam in order to balance out all the negative reviews. The lame excuses for supposedly doing so were that it was in Early Access, it cost $27, it was first day, and so on. Early Access means a game is PLAYABLE, though may have some bugs, need for polish, and may have more content to be added. This is not playable. First day? Still needs to play. Costs $27? Even if this cost $1, the Devs released this to early access as a game that will function. It does not. And I have to wonder if some of those people on the official Discord encouraging people to up vote despite issues were employees of the Devs, but that is conjecture and unknown by me. But I am certainly not going to mislead my fellow gamers by up voting a game that has sever issues, much less I can't even play.

Update: I was finally able to play after NUMEROUS attempts and rushing through character creation. Problem is, the game still keeps crashing and causing the whole computer to stop and requiring to go through start up again. I have played several days now and had quit literally so many crashes that I am most likely approaching 100 of them. Particularly frustrating when you get killed because of a crash. Or even trying to do a safer activity like farming for the resources you need for food, boosts, and medicine is aggravating. You have to spend MANY boring minutes fast clicking to use your hoe on a field to increase its ""soil porisity""  at the same time that value is quickly decreasing. So the game crashing the computer wipes out a large part of your progress when you finally return. If you can even return... Over the weekend there started to be long ques to even get in the game. So game kicks you to then wait 30 minutes plus sometimes to get back in. The game has been having daily updates, but still the problems remain. And those have been kicking players out for 30 minutes or a full hour and occurring at 6 PM EST on the North American server. Who thought that kicking people during prime time was a good idea? Devs in China.

Update: PvP needs a serious overhaul. An alliance of 1,500 plus Chinese players has been bouncing around server to server and just wrecking everything then moving to the next. No skill required by them. Dead server. Some have compared this game to Conan Exiles, which there does appear to be a lot pilfered from that game. But in Conan Exiles PvP you could hide your base and for someone to zerg you, they would have to spend considerable time first finding your base. In Myth of Empires, the decay rate of your buildings is ridiculously fast. We are talking 1 to 2 days and walls I put up were gone from decay. To counter the decay and get your buildings to last longer (though decay is still obnoxiously fast), you need to place an alliance boundary marker. The boundary marker also has lots of other necessary features, so a must have. BUT, the boundary marker also places a nice shiny token on everyone's map so it is easy to see where all alliance bases are located. So back to those 1,500+ Chinese demonstrating no skill and less imaginative game play bouncing through the small number of available official servers, they are making PvP pointless and will soon kill all the official servers many times over. So if you are wanting PvP from this game, either pay for a private server or find another game.",1637270905,1637717951,False,3,2,0.366938322782516479,0,True,False,True

This year, (in my opinion) has been one of the worst if not the WORST year for new games and having Myth of Empires release in such a fun stable state exceeded my expectations. It isn't perfect, but it plays better than 95% of early access games that come out and it has a HUGE amount of potential. Below is a short list of things I love and things I think they could change.

Pros: 

The map is pretty huge, they are updating server capacity so I hope to see huge epic battles between guilds in the future. PvE is a lot of fun too if you are a more casual player such as myself and you have a lot of freedom to choose where you want to build and how you want to build it. 

The building system is far superior to other games such an Valheim and even Ark. Not to say they're bad but it seems Myth of Empires made sure to fix all the cons of building in those games. The building is still not perfect, but I'm confident over time it will be fixed up nicely. 

Myth of Empires is beyond beautiful to look at and is extremely immersive. I get lost looking at the scenery and love the atmosphere at night and when a storm starts, it can get really intense and I think that's wonderful. Looking at distant mountains in the background make me want to go visit, explore and build around each new area I discover. It truly is just a very immersive experience.

I haven't seen many bugs yet either. Maybe one or two over my 40 hours of playing but definitely not enough to actually complain about. The devs seem to be incredibly active which gives me hope during these dark gaming times. I sincerely hope they treat this as their baby because I can easily see this being one of the biggest games on steam if they keep it up.

As many have stated on here already it takes the best aspects of all the good survival games and mixes it them into one. I honestly thought this game would be another disappointment because of the tall order they put on themselves but again the devs have been fantastic thus far and I hope they keep it up. There's probly more I can't think of right now, it's a huge game, even overwhelming sometimes but it's fun to learn and progress.

Cons:

I think the biggest con of the game overall might be the movement speed. It feels extremely realistic but because of the map size it feels like it takes ages to explore, which isn't that big of a deal but maybe having a way earlier on to increase movement speed other than horses could be a good idea. Not a huge increase because that would ruin the realistic feel but I definitely think pushing it up a notch or two would be completely fine.

Another annoying thing I've been dealing with is when building and destroying you don't get resources back (or very little) meaning if I'm trying to experiment with ways to build a camp, I need to carefully plan things out and do trial and error. Constantly going back to get the resources for the finished product makes building take twice as long. Again not a huge deal but I think having a timer to remove and replace recently built objects like 15 seconds or something would be nice and being able to move furniture and stuff around would be great too because having to destroy and rebuild every time seems a bit much. It seems more realistic to me to just move a cabinet rather than destroying and rebuilding it just to move it 1 pixel away.

Continuing with the building, I'd like to see more options. More furniture, different walls/gates, buildings, etc. I'm sure we will get it in the future, it just seems a little 'bare bones' right now so that is another minor thing I'm looking forward too in the near future.

Some enemies seem a little too strong unless you are in a group. I'm more scared of bears in this game than I am for a nuclear winter in real life. Basically 1 hit instant kills me even if their same level, even on a horse and the enemies sometimes will run after you till the ends of the earth. Seriously.  They chase for so long I'm half expecting to see it in person after opening my front door. No joke, a wolf ran after me from the middle of the map, to the right side for like 15 minutes and started murdering a group of noobs. Sure it was hilarious, but I definitely think there should be a boundary limit to how far they'll chase you. 

That's about it for this review. I might edit it in the future when more updates have come out or if I think there's anything else that needs to be included. I'm really enjoying my time with it, a bit too much. 42 hours in 3 days. For me, this is my game of the year.

TLDR: Myth of Empires is a truly beautiful game with an insane amount of potential. This could be one of the all time great steam games (we need a new one these days) if the devs keep showing it the same amount of love they have for the next couple years. Seriously impressed with how much they've completed for the beginning of an early access game. If you like the survival genre pick this one up ASAP. It will only get more expensive, so right now it's a steal and I look forward to future updates. 

Thanks for reading and have fun!

The game is not bugged at all, I've been playing it since launch (more than 80hrs now) and never found a bug or a glitch.
The speed... get used to it, it's how it is, you'll need to skill up to remove a lot of movement penalties. I was playing Ark before in a boosted server with 200% running speed and I already got used to it.
The game is well designed, has a lot of stuff to do from PvE to PvP, but you have to sink hours in it if you want to evolve fast, as in all Survival Sandbox MMO's
So if you don't have the time or want to play alone, settle in a PvE server or just don't buy the game at all.
The devs are working hard on this and solving the problems that arise (its an Early Access remember?) and what I find amazing is when they say the maintenance is gonna take half an hour, it takes half an hour or less, unlike some recent launches that sped things up just to make fast money and now aren't able to fix their game...

The devs are active, they respect the maintenance deadlines, i feel respected as a gamer and consumer - not like with EA/AGS/Blizz etc who are delivering unfinished overpriced products.

The good :

- UE4 with nice graphics and customization
- Fully fledged crafting
- Personal and guild skill system
- Base building, land claiming
- Guild features, roles and permissions
- NPC Slavery

The bad :
- A bit slow moving speed when on-foot
- Combat is clunky
- Grindy

No real bugs i've been hitting and non of the usual EA survival game super laggy releases, everything seems to just be smooth.

Works fine as a solo player, as a little group of 2-3 and has whole clans it a really well balanced game for every gamer out there. You have PvE servers that you can play on or PvP servers.

You can later on in the game transfare between servers as you like (for a minor in-game cost) but if you dont want your base destroyd you can build on a PvE server, and just transfare over to a PvP server once in awhile if you want PvP. or just duel people on a PvE server.

Progress will be abit slower if you play alone, but you are able to do most of the content alone.

All crafting can be done alone etc im just talking about the Guild progress will be slow (you can make a 1 man guild)

All in all, i havent had this much fun, or been swallowed by a Survival game like this since Ark release and conan release (and they where buggy as all hell)

I will say that the combat system feels like it needs work, but - it feels different, new and fun. The crafting is probably the BEST thing about this game, and the fact that everything decays, and you drop your loot on death makes everything have MEANING.

Probably one of the best games I've played in a while. There is just so much to do and the open world, feels open. Build and siege, capture and train an army. You rely on your warriors and friends - so team up, it's a multiplayer game, don't expect to play this solo (you can do it, but I personally wouldn't recommend it; small groups feel great!).

A jó dolgok:
1. Hangulatos ahogy leépítitek a kis falutokat mindenki tud lerakni saját zászlót amiben el tudsz adni nyersanyagokat réz pénzért (limitálva mennyit tudsz egy nap darabra és max pénzre is, érdemes drágább dolgokat eladni)
2. PVE szerveren érdemes kezdeni, de ne gondold hogy nem lesz akció. Folyamatosan támadnak a banditák/vadállatok és elég erősek főleg az elején, de ahogy harcoltok az kihat a szerverre és a banditák is egyre agresszívabbak lesznek.
3. Kereskedés nagyon jól ki van találva, lehet úgy kereskedni hogy csak veszel dolgokat és elviszed máshová majd eladod profitért, vagy lehet eladni ugye nyersanyagokat illetve van közös guild piac amire kirakhatjátok a nyersanyagokat vagy bármit eladni.
4. Questek amik segítenek a játékot megismerni (nagyon jó és adnak kis pénzt is)
5. Lehetnek embereid (alapból 5 aztán később 10) akiket lehet dolgoztatni, illetve szinttől függően tudsz vinni magaddal párat (max 3) harcolni is! (több ritkaságú/szintű stb van nagyon komoly a rendszer).
6. Ló betőrés és idomítás - nagyon élveztem mert tök fun volt ez is ahogy megoldották.
7. Feltámasztás - ló/npc karaktereket fel lehet támasztani ha van hozzá épületed így nem vész el akkor sem ha véletlen meghalsz útközben (amúgy full loot van, de pve szerveren 30 percig vissza tudod szerezni a holttestedből a dolgokat
8. Jó a tapasztalati szint felzárkóztatás (vesz a szerver egy átlag szintet és addig segít felfejlődni mindenkinek gyorsabban bónusz xp-vel)
9. Mindennel tudsz fejlődni, ha gyűjtögetsz, ha craftolsz, ha harcolsz és az adott skillekben szerzel plusz szinteket amivel extra perkeket lehet kinyitni (kicsi bónuszokat vagy nagyokat adnak).

A rossz dolgok:
1. A jogosultság rendszer még nem a legjobb, elég stabil de jó lenne ha lennének plusz opciók. 
2. Az állatoknál érzem hogy kéne még egy kis balance, pl a farkasok lefutják a lovat sokszor hosszútávon.
3. Ahogy sokan írják sok helyen kínai még a szöveg, de nem lényeges annyira.
4. Ha egyedül vagy meg vagy lőve pvp-szinten de pve-ben azért el lehet lenni.

*Hit boxes feel sloppy and there's no real feedback whether you hit something or not.

*FoV is Screwed beyond belief, Hell the camera angle in general is off putting.

*Environmentally looks decent, Some sloppy designs here and there.

After 30 hours in game i can give a round review in game i think
Audio is a bit off and at times bad but thats the only bad issue with game probably going to be solved sooner than later.
Graphic wise there are some points to be improved, but it has great graphics in total, better than conan or ark, and with almost 0 bugs and lag issues.(watch the top of the mountains on the moonlight while u fish and u ll understand me)
Gameplay: now i ll sound harsh but it has more depth than life is feudal,ark,conan,last oasis and close to or similar only to kenshi (kenshi is a bit better on details)
The gameplay where u can hunt animals and according to your behaviour towards them, u gain or lose reputation that results to animals to act ""friendly or indefferent"" to u, to even attack on site reactions
U can build castles (imagine the size on conan  but without the gods and constant hunt for priests) very big buildings,multi leveled, with defferent grades of material(wood, clay and so on) and make your structure more ressilient to attacks
U can build all kind  of weapons but i would like a bit more variety on it, like i like there are 2 kinds of shields but not round shields cause chinese didnt use them, or differnt kind of swords, and so on
UI is amazing and has sooo many bars and skills and traits and progression to do and to unlock,i cant give an example of a game so good made in ui aspect ,not even close
The game is grindy but to the point  of realistic not crazy
IF u want a big castle u need alot of mats that are hard to gather,dangers are all around the corners  to kill u even by accident
The sec u throw your arrow on a fox and 15 come to kill u as they do u ll understand how realistic it is, wolves can be solo or in packs of even 5-6 , pigs are almost always in pairs , deers in 3-4 and tigers so far i ve seen only solo :P
(yes there are tigers and it instant killed me and my horse at level 28)
horses can be tamed and used in mellee or ranged combat like conguerors blade but not as smooth(as said this is realistic)
Archery is amazing and on to the point with the targeting system
Mellee fight is similar to the last oasis directional hits action combat
CRAFTING is amazing and u can craft almost anything u imagine (sure some things are missing but i am not in the end game i am in early game)
your actions in game contribute points to the guild that uses your activity points and gold to improve its status and influence
AND to top that all u can go to npc camps ( there are hostile and friendly ones) where u can fight different level of npcs which like in conan u can drag around and start torturing so u can have them as slaves
(in conan u put them in wheel of pain and u wait for them to be ready , here u can tie them up and litterally u beat them to hell and back and u increase stats by doing so too ....CRAZZYYYYYYY!!!)
u can discover mineral places and make mines for using them yourself to mine what u need (copper, iron.etc) or use one of your beloved slaves
all in all in 30 hours i think the game needs a few additions,the european players just started founding about this game, they just added 3 more eu servers yesterday, but as a game in early access its OMG
and this comes from a player that plays all kind of survival games with 1000s of hours gametime
i really think  u should  give this game a chance already 25k players everyday enjoy it 
AHHH forgot it also has pvp if u so choose 
hope i see u in the official server

There is some server side ping spikes that I hope improve but usually sitting at ~80 in NA. Devs have already expanded the servers due to the player base picking up, and hopefully they will continue to improve them, as the game becomes more popular.

First off, the trailer is misleading.  It will be weeks or months before you start seeing any kind of epic battle, or a fight that is beyond a boar that ruins your day.  (seriously, screw boars!)

However what you will find here, is a deep crafting game with some elements of Life is Feudal mixed in.  There is a healthy balance of pvp and pve servers with the ability to cross between them at will (at a cost that's reasonable).  Meaning, any alpha guilds on pvp servers do need be wary of very large PVE guilds invading their lands and completely upending the power structures.

There's a lot of depth here that's not detailed or fleshed out in documentation or wiki's, at the moment of this writing a lot of the end-game mechanics are not well known to the players and it's a knowledge of who's who figuring things out.

Server stability has been good.  This is important to note.

Things are looking up for this early access title, and I do believe with some subsequent content updates, animation fixes and continued support by the community, there might be something here that rivals even that of New World, even with a small development team behind it.

Base-raiding is busted at the moment. Make a load of swords and get to it and you can eat through the doors damn fast. 
PVE is where this game shines because you live long enough to see just how deep the crafting system is. 
If you don't mind playing PVE then I'd say check this game out. If you don't mind ganking and getting ganked as soon as you see a person, with for the first 30-40 levels --and never if they outnumber you-- zero chance of victory, try the PVP. 
Interested to see where it goes but doubtful it's going to reinvent the wheel in the genre any without a massive rethink of PVP. There needs to be some significant consequence to just murdering everyone you see.

I'll update my review if the game play outweighs the forced anti-aliasing and whomever thought Bing Translate would be a sufficient tool for language localization.

I know this is Early Access and the game will likely change/improve, and if it does, so will this review.

UPDATE: I've sunk approximately 2 hours into the game and decided to refund. I want to give a brief review and explain why.

Aside from the aforementioned forced anti-aliasing and terrible translation, there are plenty of other issues. Opinions are subjective of course, but for me this boiled down to a ""has potential, will try again later... maybe"" EA game.

My biggest complaint is the game feels, for lack of a better word, janky. Animations are awkward, the UI is overwhelming with little visual hierarchy which compounds the problem, progression systems are massive and hardly intuitive, running and walking are borderline identical in speed and neither are adequate, sound design is shy and reserved, music shows up randomly and without a relevant trigger, combat fluctuates between too simple and overly convoluted. Even the chat doesn't have word wrap and breaks words between two lines. That sounds petty to even mention but that's my point; everything is janky.

I'm well aware that the game is in EA but that justification has limits, determined by the subjective value to the player/investor. If that's confusing, consider doubling the cost of an EA title in your library and how that might have affected your decision to purchase it in the first place in an unfinished state.

For me, this game is not worth the price point, and the lack of polish right out of the gate is unpleasant (and confusing as hell thanks to the translations). I know the game has potential, but when I say that I mean it could go either way. 

My apprehension comes from seeing game studios do this a lot; focus on quantity over quality and dismiss the vertical slice. If you're not a huge nerd here's an analogy: some studios serve an amazing appetizer and get people hungry for the rest of the meal. Others worry that an appetizer won't satiate the masses and drop a five course meal on the table that tastes a lot like mediocrity. Most successful game studios go the appetizer route. An example would be RUST if you want a direct comparison or Divinity Original Sin 2 if you want an indirect comparison. They release polished, tasty apps that everyone wants more of. This game, on the other hand, dropped like 50 items on my table to enjoy but the problem is I'm actually at an Applebees and I'm dying. Will they refine those 50 items and do their best to work with what they have? Or uh oh here comes the dessert cart with 50 more items that taste like diabetes and depression? I'm gonna guess based on this release, it's gonna be the latter. Guess we'll see.",1637459978,1637540642,False,7,3,0.496086865663528442,0,True,False,True

I've seen comparisons with Conan Exiles, which I have hundreds of hours in, but it's not a fair comparison. Conan is simplistic compared to this, it's not an MMO (you play on servers) and from a scale point of view it's much smaller. This game is massive. I'm only 4 hours in and already I can tell you the depth is astounding. 

It's no where near as polished as Conan, but then Conan is a AAA game and is not in EA. I've heard progress is slow on this, I have to disagree. I'm already level 17 four hours in, I have a horse and I'm using Copper. I know there is a massive amount of features and capabilities for me to progress towards and I've barely used any of my unlocks (Engrams).  

Pro's:
- Lots of depth.
- Tutorial is pretty good and four hours in it's still teaching me.
- Massive range of craftables.
- Base building is simple and extensive, better than Conan in IMO.
- Massive range of skills.
- Nice graphics.
- Runs smoothly.
- Easy progression at the start.
- Super fun.

Con's:
- The interface is laggy, the mouse moves slowly in menus and the keys respond slowly, i.e. can't quickly switch across hotbar items. Have to wait until whatever animation (getting of horse) has finished.
- Blur effect is annoying but you get used to it and don't notice it after a while.
- LOTS of spelling mistakes (in English), fonts incorrectly sized and overall the interface needs a lot of work.
- FYI this is a Asian game, I don't mean just developed by Asians, the character audio is Asian, the armor and buildings are Asian, the NPCs are Asian - it's an Asian game.

From what little combat I've engaged in it's sluggish compared to other games like Conan. General input responsiveness is sluggish but until I get further along I wouldn't want to over comment on this.

What the fuck. Seriously, this doesnt make sense. And before you jump to the developers defense, listen. Look at my steam library, look at how many games I own. I am no newbie to alpha/beta game releases on steam.

Your position in queue wont move more than 1 position every 20 minutes. According to their server stats, there are hundreds of people playing on each server.

+ fighting system similar to M&B Bannerlord
+ tameable NPC's
+ possibility to combine PvE and Pvp
+ lot of various animals and great horse taming :)
+ not much grind needed to progress
+ public and private servers

- graphics looks old, although most of the textures are fancy, its unbalanced and sometimes loading slowly
- Its hard to orientate in user interface. Not exactly intuitive.
- weird sound effects, lack of music to build the immersion
- small details like translation mistakes, graphic glitches etc.

Overall its underestimated small game with huge potential, hope they will not screw it up and it will become one of the greatest MMO's in a year or two.",1637515576,1637515576,True,1,0,0.49253728985786438,0,True,False,True

Discord or the like is neccessary unless your good with an ok graphic lone farming sim. I joined a guild, because you cant get to a pvp server to battle until GUILD LEVEL 2 so I gathered all my belongings and made a long journey during which my horse died and had to abandon precious materials Id spent hours gathering, because of weight. I got there, my new home allies surrounded me and were following me and messaging me ... lol So long story short they tricked me, killed me took everything and kicked me out of the guild so i didnt have access to my belongings. 8 hours in(as a dad thats like a week) And c oc k su c ke r allies took it in 5 minutes. Combat stinks compared to bannerlord or even common rps. You are so weak at (8 hr lvl18) you cant kill a boar with spear + shield + Armour. PVP combat blows because of janky nature.

Animals just vanish if we get too close to them and despite restarting the servers, verifying game files, and a complete reinstall of the game, nothing seems to have fixed it.

This should NOT be called MMO IMO.  
The multiplayer in this game consists of joining a small population server and forming very small groups to raid each other, if everyone joins into one faction then there will be very little to do on the server since you can't just jump over into other server for any sort of guild Waring. 

I'm not going to accept ""it's early access dude and totally will be much better on release"" argument, been there done that, got scammed several times before. No thanks.

Big map, game feels very fleshed out in several areas, only needing some updates on things. Graphics look decent, character customization is pretty good. Crazy amount of stuff you can lvl up, everything is its own stat and lvl, you can gain prestige through social ranks and whatnot. Servers are big, with big pop, options of pvp, or pve. Game makes you start pve, which I thought was lame at first, but turned out to be helpful with how much there is to do. Do try the starting quests they will explain everything just about.

However, there are issues, horrible issues. Game is a grind, a hardcore grind, you are squishy, VERY squishy, unbelievably SQUISHY, and SLOW. The time to attack from click is HORRIBLE, like just, absolutely HORRIBLE, we're talking full second- second and a half from click to actual attack on things like spear. The translation cuts english text off making things very confusing at points but not a dealbreaker. Lvling up to 16 is relatively quick, but once you hit 20 it seems like a brick wall of grind to lvl up to get better crafts.

The game says its localized but I can't read 20% of whats on the screen when I look at a building piece because its in another language\character set. This feels like a re-skin of ark with less performance and less things to hunt and tame. Gathering is generic as everything looks the same everywhere. Building and crafting is confusing, cooking is non intuitive - even though its rooted from ARK... Experience game doesn't feel intuitive, player customization seems lengthy with no mystery other than hey this thing you might want is level 900 good luck! Finding your friends and any social activity is horrible, joining a clan, inviting people, none of it makes sense then you get hit with a clan cap. I may put some time into this and actually do the pvp, but iv'e had more magical launch experiences with Conan, Dark and Light, ARK, and Last Oasis - and this one is surely missing on many notes.

*but* its what the survival community can suffer through, in order to rally as a group looking to create and consume -content-

I am in one of the leading clans and already solutions of dual boxing, account sharing, and afk scripting of present. The developers want you to afk in this game, and if you plan to grind the experience for crafting you will be sitting at a crafting station like a bot, thus prompting you to purchase another steam account so you can actually play ""the game"".

The current concerns are the travel costs between servers and what the first raids will look like with such a costly journey to take, but we feel one clan is close to being able to test this at scale. Will update the review as I go I guess.

Server stability is fairly reliable for a launch, and the scale of population continues to grow, so for the low cost of this game entry barrier to the fun you might have with friends building a home and attacking bandit camps I am going to recommend this title.",1637300826,1637449920,True,0,1,0.426289081573486328,0,True,False,True

the pros - if you like these types of games youll like this one too. it has alot of simple but to the point functions that work well. it also has a starting quest line that teaches you everything you need to know to get into the game which is nice. unlike alot of others that just drop you into the world and say figure it out. the game has both PVE and PVP so everyone is happy so that is also nice. also plenty of upgrades and leveling up and tons to unlock. 

the cons - over all the game does feel a little slow, run speed, combat, crafting just everything feel a tiny bit slow. the game menus can be a little overwhelming at first and take a bit of time to understand what you are looking at. this next point if fully just my opinion but combat suck... it uses camera directional combat so you attacks are based on which way your camera is facing being up, down, left or right. and honestly this is just system i dont think works in any game. it always ends up making you swing you camera around wildly and doing this wired back and forth pacing type of combat. i think this game would work alot better with maybe like a stance change systsem, like high mid and low. almost like Nioh. now i will add this game has a quick attach option where you can just keep clicking the key and keep attacking it is a bit faster but still clunky.

While it has progression via quests and side quests a lot of the game is left unexplained, being so new game guides and wiki are sparse and many of your questions about the game cannot be found even on their official discord. An example would be your quests lead you to create a personal claim, that claim is protected from decay via a personal claim banner that has a 2 day timer. When you hover over it, it has text saying you have paid for protection, interact with it and it gives you a method of selling items for currency to the lord or the land. You would assume (based on games like Rust with their resource cabinets) this was a way of increasing your protection window but that isn't the case. Essentially you have to destroy and replace the personal claim flag to reset the personal timer, which isn't stated anywhere. Oh and when it comes to guild claims, you CAN reset the timer without replacing, which leads to confusion.

Server Selection is... weird. I assume you start by selecting a Global Hub, Then a regional server hub (EU/NA/Asia) and finally a game region. Thankfully when you rejoin the game there is a ""quick join"" option but I hope friends can join me via steam friends as I have no idea how to find out exactly what/where I am located. I know that each server is 80 players and you can transfer from one server to another via ingame currency but I've yet to find the NPC to allow me to do so.

Graphics are decent, The game puts my poor RX 580 to 99% utilisation however hidden under the nice grass and foliage most of the actually ground surface lacks detail like you would find in games like Conan Exiles. Its a game that looks nice with full graphics but looks like a game from 2002 if you strip away the foliage.

Combat Mechanics are clunky. You have two modes ""MoE"" and ""Classic"". The only difference I could see is MoE's own mode blocks while you hold the attack key down and you move your mouse to the direction you want to attack from, while Classic Mode enables right click block. I need to input here that you right click block with off-hand when one is equipped so I'd recommend using MoE mode. At any rate, this game is not a fast paced twitch shooter, more like a combat simulator in which player tactics and positioning will be key over player skill and reaction time. It play like Last Oasis but much slower and without grappling, nor is it as fluid as games like Conan Exiles.

Crafting is good, its slightly too resource intensive early game, talking 1000's of grass turned into rope and 100's of trees for a basic 2x2 house and armour. I've not even gotten to the smelting stage yet, although I have gathered copper ready for it. Your early game is wood, bone then hide/fabric. The Crafting progression is nice, earn points with actions and use points to unlock a progression tree split into 4 or 5 different tabs.

Nobility system is still early days for me, I've ranked up once which gave me 2.5% more HP. From what I've seen thus far you can become a lord of the land and such, have peons to work for you like Thralls in Conan Exiles but I've not gotten that far. I did find recruits, who when you walk upto them and press E they list the various stuff they want as payment for you to hire them, thinks like raw meat and armour.

Levelling seems to happen as you play, gathering, crafting and completing quests. There are even daily quests and such but at this time levelling up is a secondary while I construct a base and progress through crafting. You level quite quickly just by progressing through the main quest line.

[b]Why do I recommend?[/b]
This game starts with your run of the mill sandbox survival game core and adds questing, governance and server transfers. If your like me and you own practically every game under the survival sandbox genre, there is a lot here that is unique to the title to justify the box price. As for the games longevity only time will tell. If the studio behind this title keep building on the foundation they have here this game could become very popular like Rust or Conan. If however they keep it as is, you will get your hours worth out of it with the content available as of right now. I would say though, the game while not in an alpha state is still rough around the edges in certain areas, if you can live with that then go for it.",1637419286,1637419286,True,33,1,0.745844423770904541,0,True,False,True

Its a mix of Conan Exile and Life is Feudal if you liked those kind of games.
HUGE map lots on NPC to recruit or fight there are even random events where wolfs or bears will attack in packs if you hunt to much then the storms OMG the 1st time i was out in the storm when the thunder and lighting started i jumped so high in my chair it scared the hell out of me.
Game is fantastic they are constantly running minor fixes and updates by the hour as players find and report

So I've spent 16 hours in the game, give or take, read the manual for it, and I've done enough content to comment on this a bit from a huge survival genre fan standpoint, but also can comment from a more technical standpoint as i've worked in the game development field as well.

This game is pretty good. that is your TL:DR of it. If you enter this to compare it to conan exiles, RUST, mount and blade, conquerors blade, ARK, Life Is Feudal, etc. then you are already setting yourself up for disappointment.

This game is very early access. Yes, it has a huge amount of content, sandbox building, skill trees, in depth grouping, guilds, city government type stuff, and other really unique features I was surprised to see. But some of the more core game mechanics need polishing. The combat is very rough around the edges as they focus on 2 different combat styles. This is coming from someone using their classic combat mode, I will be switching next time im on the other combat mode.

Also, everyone is really early level. My current official server, the top is lv 28 before penalties, And i've been putting a lot of time into the game as well, but I am no where near top level or high level crafting. I don't even know where to get Iron yet.

The PVP i cannot even comment on because I am on an official server which is PVE currently, but you can take your character to other servers (Counties).

Translation needs work, combat needs work, some animations need work, the building system needs a few adjustments but it works.

Again, its not a terrible game, It is pretty, its fun if you are into these sorts of games, and I cannot wait to start getting into diplomacy, seeing how transactions and trades work out, see a huge siege battle or huge armies marching by.

Again, if you come into this game comparing it to others, you will start off having a bad time. Every game everyone is comparing this too all started in this state and crawled out of their bad reviews slowly. Giant survival games like this take a lot of polishing before they end up great. Some dont even make it to the great part.

The state of this game and early access, and if you like survival type games? I can recommend. It is constantly being updated, bugs are getting squished, you can tell by the systems in place that the developers like what they are working on, its a good game. Will it get better? in time of course. They seem to be listening to the playerbase / early access buyers, so yeah, I can recommend. Needs work though, but its playable and enjoyable. Also, go start in the riverlands or the mountains, its beautiful out there.

I would ignore the low hour count reviews. Not disregarding their opinion, but the game does not really open up till around lv 20. A lot of today's pc gamer's demand a lot of instant satisfaction and do not realize this is a slow burn game like ARK or conan. It takes time to get to where you need to be, but each tier is rewarding and does not feel grindy.....yet. time will tell though.

current state? 7/10

Please note, this is an early access game that is being actively worked on by the developers. I believe i read somewhere that about 70% of the game's build is available currently. That's where we will start!

Price: $26 is what it's at currently. For what you get, that is INCREDIBLE value. There is a lot to take in and a whole lotta game for that price.

Graphics: Absolutely breathtaking, especially the beefier the GPU or PC you have. I have a 1080TI that is doing about 55 FPS on 1440p High to Ultra settings. Even on 1080p this game looks gorgeous

Animations: Slower to start but that's mostly due to starting out at lvl zero. Has a very mount and blade like feel and the animations are smooth. Things do not feel clunky or overdone, its just smooth. For early access, that's a huge win and a great base to build off of.

Content: Im only 2 hours into the game, but you don't need ample playtime to be able to tell what is here. Sifting through the menus you can craft, upgrade skills, learn tactics, tame a horse and recruit companions, become a high ranking noble, and so much more! The depth of what is here in early access is astounding. 

I have personally already crafted wooden armor and the next set of bronze armor looks incredible. The menus remind me of my oblivion days, and the artistic style of symbols are so well done. Who would of ever thought looking at peas in my inventory would be so mesmerizing??!

Future: The developers are listening and are active. I do feel like they want this game to succeed beyond a financial standpoint. They encourage creating guilds and community groups and seem to care about bringing out the best in this game so far.

Text: One complaint i have heard so far is the english translation. Personally, i have not ran into this issue or it has not been prevalent enough for me to notice, one or the other. I can understand the frustration if it is happening to some. I would imagine this is something that gets corrected but I cannot say anything negative here as it has not impacted me so far.

Conclusion: So i have said many positives, and that's because I am losing my taste in games in general. This game brings me something to look forward to for the 1st time in many years. This is coming from a person who enjoyed games like Skyrim, Oblivion, Mount and Blade, Total War, Dark Souls, and more. We may be on to something special here if Myth Of Empires can join those ranks, and it makes it even more special it has online capabilities. The variety and customization this game has to offer gives this game massive potential, and that's where i will end things on my conclusion aspect, because you simply have to try this game to know how much it can offer.

Recommendation: Not must own yet being only 2 hours in but has MASSIVE potential! I would say this game is a must try. You cannot go wrong for the price point it currently sits at, and even if you wait i imagine so many things are coming, beyond what's already here. 

To the developers: Keep up the great work, im already so immersed into this game and hope to experience much more!

Grade so far based on play experience: B+  8.5/10

Grade so far based on what i anticipate is to come with playtime and experience: A 9.5/10

And FInally, my overall grade from what the game is striving to be, what is anticipated and not in the game plus what's in the game currently: A++ 11/10",1637363817,1637364180,True,3,0,0.496437042951583862,0,True,False,True

Nevertheless, you have to get there first...and personally I did not have a good feeling regarding the game based on the beginning.

English translation is auto-translate, much of the text is difficult to understand.

Played for a little over an hour - the entire time playing was spent doing quite boring harvesting with difficult to maneuver menus. It looked like there was a lot to unlock and I appreciate that, but I just kept playing because I was hoping that the game would become more fun suddenly. I know that there's a lot to see beyond the first few hours with recruitable units and combat, but I feared too would end up being tedious and frustrating, so I stopped playing early on. For a review on the mid/late game you best read someone else's review. If you, like me, care about how fun a game is in the beginning then I can tell you that the beginning at least is tedious.

Music barely played, felt a bit out of place when it did.

Graphics are nice, I think the game looked quite beautiful and the character customization is a nice touch (you can make very ridiculous looking characters!). On my RTX 3080 the game ran fine.

When the game turned off, my machine basically stopped working.

I can see where they are going with it and I love the M&B Bannerlord mixed with Medieval Dynasty aspect to it, almost feels like a realistic version of Valheim. The crafting is great. I’m running it on a pretty much potato PC but it runs really well and have had no lags or crashes. If you love Valheim, Bannerlord, Medieval Dynasty and other medieval games alike then this is a great game which you will definitely enjoy! Definitely looking forward to more content. 

Would be great to have some more NPC interactions or towns and villages where you can imerse yourself. At the moment all NPCs and camps or villages are hostile and will attack you at first sight. Only recruitable soldiers do not attack.

This game is NOT garbage.
After streaming this for 12 hours I can say that it's like Conan Exiles and Last Oasis had a baby!
There are some minor translation issues in quest instructions that are confusing but that is the ONLY issue I had with the entire game on launch day.
After launch day issues from titles like LIFMMO and ATLAS, this is extremely minimal in comparison.
I heard some people had crashing, I did not.
The game runs smooth, has a great crafting tree and allows the PVE player a TON of breathing room to explore the game without the usual PVP trolls as the PVP comes later on a different server.
So if you like Conan/ ARK/ Life is Feudal/ Last Oasis I would recommend you give this a try.
But if you still aren't sold on it, you can always watch my launch day game play here-

Positives..
-The character creation is surprisingly good, and the game looks amazing.
-The game is pretty easy to hop into and get rolling. I am not mmorpg savvy but I understood enough to follow the tutorial quests and get my guy settled into the world.
-Combat and gameplay feel realistic enough to scratch that itch but remain fun and gamey enough.
-I see a ton of potential and the game as is can be played for hours on end without too much complaint.

Negatives.
- Translation is not tremendous.  I was able to understand everything well enough. Nothing was unclear. Just minor syntax and spelling errors. 
- the game is not 100% polished, as is i would play it for days but it obviously could use a few more go overs for improvements.

Played more throughout the course of the night and it only got better for me.

What might start as a standard survival experience will quickly see a blend of a combination of games. Ark and Conan meet Mount and Blade meets Three Kingdoms meets Runescape. I know that's a crazy combination.

Conan felt cheap, tacky and despite allowing you to recruit NPC's they felt lifeless. Each person you recruit could have different stats as well as traits and skill ceilings. So there's a little of shadow of war even dropped in.

- No performance issues or crashes for EA
- Servers Seem fine
- Looks like quite a bit of content for EA
- Progression seems rewarding
- World seems very large and a lot to explore
- AI good counter to PVP

The Okay:
- Def need a group to play/enjoy all aspects of game
- Combat is a bit clunky and takes getting used to
- level 20+ the grind gets a bit slower
- Not clear how jump to PVP servers work and if you can go back to PVE servers

First the Pro's: 

- English translation is auto-translate, much of the text is difficult to understand. 10/10 - working as intended

- When the game turned off, my machine basically stopped working. The anti cheat blocked some system dll from operating and I couldn't open my task manager, close the anti cheat, close steam etc. Had to reset my machine, very annoying. 10/10 - working as intended

- Most things are translated poorly, and some strings are left untranslated. is this a repeat? Its because its so glorious that I have to say it again.  10/10 - working as intended

- Music barely played, felt a bit out of place when it did. 10/10 - working as intended

- Played for a little over an hour - the entire time playing was spent doing quite boring harvesting with difficult to maneuver menus. It looked like there was a lot to unlock and I appreciate that, but I just kept playing because I was hoping that the game would become more fun suddenly. I know that there's a lot to see beyond the first few hours with units and combat, but judging from the experience in the beginning that too would end up being tedious and frustrating. 10/10 - working as intended

- Graphics are nice, I think the game looked quite beautiful and the character customization is a nice touch (you can make very ridiculous looking characters!). And I was able to fat shame myself in the process... 10/10 - working as intended

- 3 fps on a 3070 card.  Need I say more? 10/10 - working as intended

Now sadly, the Cons:

- Game is only $26.99, this has fail and money grab all over the place.

- It's early access when it should be FULL RELEASE. I mean come-on, everyone in this era knows that Early Access is the new standard for GOLD Master.  The devs are trully lying to us about this. Games developers charge money for should be finished products.  WHAT THE HELL.

- Clearly a game meant for playing with a whole war tribe of idiots following 1 leader.  There goes my chance to be the giant overlord of the world by myself. :( Very disappointed at this.  I wanted to dominate the whole universe like Darth Vader and crush it under my fist, but apparently I can't do that solo.

- Steam Cheevos are not in Chinese GOD DAMMIT!!

Overall, this game is great.  It's a fresh concept never seen before and I think it's going to be GOTY for sure.  I'm glad I gave in to all the crafted advertising out there and bought it.  If Lowtax was alive he would have bought this game for sure.  #RIPLowtax #rememberLowtax #teamlowtax #weareallLowtax",1637254336,1637293799,True,5,4,0.438739746809005737,3,True,False,True

The combat is so clunky and slow and to try and fight any more than a single enemy is pointless as they will just rush you and you have no choice but to stand there blocking and eventually dying from the random hits that get through your blocks. 

If you get hit you get staggered and stop attacking. Fighting something simple like 2 boars is pointless unless you are close to your spawn point, as you will die and have to run back, pick up your items and keep fighting, hoping that the boars have not regained the health. If you are on horse back and running around enemies, getting the odd hit in here and there. The enemies (if human npc's) will stop trying to hit you with melee and just throw rocks untill they kill either you or your horse. 

The combat alone is enough to want a refund on this game, unfortunately for me it took over 2 hours to get to the point where I felt I could start PvE combat with human enemies and Steam will not refund if you have more than 2 hours play time (which is bullshit as most games require a lot more time to really get into a lot of the games mechanics). 

I have played thousands of hours worth of survivalcraft / PvP games and this one so far can't even do PvE right, the PvP side is just as bad if not worse as lag becomes a massive issue, I am from Australia and there are no Aus servers. Playing a PvP focused game with 120 - 200 ms is pointless, especially when the game is very melee focused. 

I cannot for the life of me recommend this game to any one, even if you get 10ms, the combat alone is that bad. 

The survival / crafting side of the game is actually decent. A lot of positives in those areas and barely any negatives. The devs have done well with these mechanics and the territory and village building aspect I barely had a chance to look at, as I have only 6 and a bit hours in the game (I know the haters are going to try and flame me for not playing 100+ hours before posting a review but like I said I have thousands of hours in survivalcraft / PvP games so stick it where it fits). 

I would like to see this game improve over time and the combat get a complete overhaul as I think it deserves it as the rest of the game seems really decent and has a huge amount of potential.

Many people experiencing technical issues with fps and the likes need to delve into the graphical settings a bit more which assists. The game using Unreal Engine has quite in depth features. I recommend disabling Depth of Field and Ambient occlusion for starters, thereafter check the post processing advanced features. This area is very demanding and subtle tweaks can give you some fps back if you are struggling with your current setup. Optimisations will come in time. Personally, I have had no issues fps wise or anything concerning. I had 1 crash after playing 9 hours straight which I would say was pretty good going!

Onto the game itself, very in depth tech trees, encouraged player interaction, guild progression, unique unlocks, titles for each province and nobility ranks, huge crafting, building the list goes on. If you like Conan Exiles or games similar sandbox wise, this will be right up your alley. The A.I in Conan was very static and scripted spawns to an extent, causing predictable encounters. At least this is slightly different and pathfinding is actually a thing instead of teleportation for your A.I!

There is also territory to own and hold including regions, cross region travel, server travel, trade with the A.I, taxes on land, resource generation and trading, the is quite a lot given it is Early Access in comparison to most games that enter it.

This game has potential and I look forward to it's progression. 

Favourite moment of game thus far. I had finished building my exterior fort walls and encompassed my main building to go on to physically use the crafting bench, watching my character animation of making an item. Without warning, my soldier suddenly begins fighting something outside and I hear him screaming in pain as he is struck. I run outside, interrupting my crafting to find a pack of 5 wolves managed to get through a gap in my walls which I had not finished. They were not around my base before and had simply wandered across to it. My soldier took a stand and I managed to fend the last of them off saving him and my base. After I killed several wolves, I had an alert stating that due to my increase in killing wildlife in the area, hostility had increased for the animals and they were more weary of my presence.

I'm not super far in, but put a lot of hours into the beta.  The UI and leveling systems are a little obtuse, but following the early quest guide helped a lot.

I appreciate the survival genre and the accompanying grind, the setting is all right and the mechanics are... eh, a little jank but passable. NPC follower pathing is generally pretty good but there are times where they'll get stuck on something indefinitely and the only remedy is to bring a horse nearby and tell them to mount it. Inventories (which is like every UI element) wait for the server response to load at all so the UI feels clunky. Building mechanics are generally solid, but for example, stairs can't be built through terrain even if it's level with your platform so you have to work around that... somehow. 

That's the feel I'm getting. I have to work around sloppy design, alpha-test-level UI (looking at you, encumbrance text), incomplete translation and what could be adequately described as minimal-effort combat. Your arrows also wait for server response to fly, which just feels off. But I have to work around this to get to the meat of the game which is, well, survival and building and progress and exploration. All of which is nice. And as a multiplayer game, another big chunk of the game's joy is from the community, either enjoying others' company or, y'know, not doing that at all.

I read these reviews saying the combat in fighting the fortresses or whatever just gets too janky, and I believe it, since the game seems unable to handle just a few NPCs in a local area doing too much at once. Reading those and other negative reviews gave me some pause, and I feel my time would be better spent on another game of the same genre.

Maybe. There's some enjoyment to be had here along the way. If this game really rubs me the wrong way in the long haul I may revise this review, but for now, it's a tentative recommend.",1637288011,1637288011,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

The movement could be improved, currently it feels clunky and sudden. However, I am truly enjoying the combat, it is a nice change of pace from a hack and slash combat style. 

The game offers a good experience for PVP and PVE players alike, with taming, building, combat ai and raiding, amd conan exile like ai recruiting!

It has a ton of good in the survival mmo genre. The progression is nice. The guild system and progression is nice. The taming animals, mounts, bribing npcs or knocking them out and torturing them till they join you.. 

The directional combat needs abit more polish as does some of the AI.

The graphics are okay and some animations and sounds are odd but that is to be expected. Idk why people are review bombing over things like move speed. Or the not perfect english because the game is an asian game. The game really focuses on skilling. Everything you do levels up as you do it. So for something like running you get faster as you just play the game. I am playing with 3 friends and its very relaxed so far on the PVE server's they have you start on. But I cannot wait for the PVP servers which by the way you get around double xp on. This game has alot of potential and I plan on giving it a couple hundred hours like I did last oasis. If you like survival games and especially medieval themed games definitely give this one a shot and once you get passed the graphics you'll see its got a ton to get into.,1637246119,1637246119,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,True

I am only using a 1070 and the game runs great. I haven't noticed an translation problems myself but I read plenty of translated\ manga and if you cant understand some subtle mistakes with words here and there I think you have bigger problems than the game does. 

Movement speed seems slow at first but over time you get used to it and the game put a lot of focus on progression so you can get stronger and faster as you level up.

Overall I would currently give the game a 9/10 and would absolutely recommend giving it a try; even more so if you liked Last Oasis. I cant wait to play it for many more hours and days and see the community grow.

I will keep my review updated as I progress farther into the game. 

The last thing I think people need to realize is that Early Access means exactly that, don't leave a negative review and review bomb a game if you haven't at leased truly tried it for a few hours",1637245683,1637245683,True,39,5,0.613362312316894531,0,True,False,True

If you enjoy any survival games or games like Conquerors Blade, Mount and blade and Tiger Knight you will love this. 
Only downside for now is that I get pretty bad fps, but my pc is getting pretty outdated.
