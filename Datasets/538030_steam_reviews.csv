Half a year after the game's launch, numerous improvements have been introduced that have led me to change my opinion. I still believe that luck plays too much of a role in the game dynamics, leading to unrealistic and frustrating situations. For instance, it's not uncommon for a bullet's trajectory to deviate by a meter within the first ten meters of its path (obviously, this is an estimation), hitting a friendly soldier. This kind of occurrence is not enjoyable. Apart from this, I believe the game is now worth it if you enjoy turn-based tactical combat games.

Original opinión:

I am a big fan of strategy games, not of games of chance. I have the feeling that the battles in Xenonauts 2 are a lottery, a frustrating experience where luck influences too much. In just 10 hours of gameplay, several times I have witnessed very unrealistic and absurd situations that have completely discouraged me. On the other hand, there is no significant qualitative advancement compared to Xenonauts 1; it's the same game with the same graphics and some new interesting functionality. It doesn't live up to wonders like Phoenix Point. On the positive side, I love the medal system. I understand that it's an early access version, but the issues I've encountered are not bugs (in fact, I haven't seen any) but rather concept and technological standards errors. I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this game; I had been waiting for its release for over a year.",1689860207,1708881691,True,0,0,0.602938234806060791,1,True,False,True

As others have stated, you will recognize most things if you've played Xenonauts or XCOM. The setup is familiar - you're defending Earth from an alien invasion, and you need to build bases and launch interceptors to bring down UFOs and send tactical teams to deal with alien incursions. There's nothing flawed with that; the formula worked well before, and a few minor changes here and a new twist there can turn it into a fresh experience.

However... as you've probably surmised, a few issues could also be improved for the experience.

In short, the game improves on the first game in some ways but is a downgrade in other ways. It feels less refined, which might change since it is still developing. Still, the graphics are less appealing to me than the original and have a cartoonish feel. The load times are worse, and the gameplay feels kludgier.

On the plus side, there are improvements to gameplay; you can rotate the camera, have different firing modes, and preview hit chances after moving - all good things, but not enough to overcome the awkward gameplay in general.

This is sad, as I was excited about this game. It could still deliver with updates, and I rate it as 60/100 mainly because there is promise here of a good game.

If you enjoyed the first Xenonauts, you should pick up this game. 


To go further, the game is good, I've played a lot of Xenonauts 1, and plenty of similar games and its my jam. I really enjoyed the verity of missions, building on the first game, where 95% of missions were crash sites. I enjoyed the cleaners story arc, fleshing out the 'story' aspect of the game, the scripted missions helped to join together the story and the game-play. 

The difficulty seems fair so far, I've been playing on iron-man/veteran and its a difficult enough to be a challenge but feels a little easier than comparable difficulty in the first game. I do think however that the game will need further balancing I'm sure things are too expensive or cheap or etc. 

The art style is enjoyable, the tactical view with its spinning is an improvement. I like the new equipment, the increased complexity of potential load-outs. 

What I hope going forwards is a continued development for the game, if the game gets finished at the current quality and fully fleshed out it will be an outstanding sequel, I'd like very much for a new air combat. I also hope that a modding scene arises when it becomes supported, I know that in the first Xenonauts the modding community extended the life of the game a great deal.

- no real new content, it would be great more tools, items and new monsters that are above and beyond copying x com
- more maps, locations, assortmant of levels and missions, after a while it kinda gos into a standard grind. more variety.

I bought Xenonauts 1, and although I enjoyed it, I did find the aim/shooting elements often frustrating (e.g. you'll be standing right next to an alien and it didn't massively increase the percentage chance to hit. That appears so much better in X2. Although just generally, I think its far superior. I really think it's right up their with the best games of this type - and a welcome successor to the OG Xcom without being too similar to Firaxis. 

Some small areas of feedback
- It gets samey - real samey. After a while you just want to skip combat missions because there's no variation. The grounded UFO is usually in one of a few places, and you get to 'know' how many aliens are going to be in and out of the ship - and how they react. I'd love to see some variance in level design and alien tactics - maybe they all swarm on one mission, maybe they sit back with sniper and you've got to use cover... maybe underwater levels, maybe levels atop a skyscraper where you've got to go up and down levels to clear out the block... Maybe there's a bomb or experiment on humans that gives a time imperative... these are could be really cool things to add 
- The alien base doors - truly annoying. They're super hard to see as they're the same colour as the walls, and the isometric view means that they (and others things) can be entirely obfuscated by the foreground items. I've wasted so much time just trying to walk around alien bases and find the doors/remaining aliens
- Right/wrong tactics - I feel that there's a right and wrong way to play this game. I personally always use snipers and destroy them all from distance. It's kinda easy then. I never lose soldiers and the aliens accuracy means I rarely get hit. What about some flying creatures? Or mortar style attacks?
- Changing difficulties. I've played through early release twice (more on that later) and I've got to about 20% of the way through, and i'm flying. I win every battle with ease - but I can't then change up the difficulty level and need to start again. Ouch - that's like 30-60 hours wasted... 
- To me, it's REALLY not clear that the game just 'stops' at 30%. I know it's early access, but come on guys, stick that s*** on the homescreen in big letters. It's a real d move to expect people to go onto forums and store pages and find this stuff out. We all have busy lives and it wouldn't take long just to have that on the main screen and then people know. Also, I completed 30% in and then on update my save game didn't work anymore, so then I went through again, hoping for more than 30% of the game to be there, but it wasn't. It was in fact, the same again. Argh (yes yes I know I could have done some research, but surely it's easier to just make that super clear on the homescreen?)  

All in all though, one of my favourite ever games. The above (apart from difficulty and messaging the current level of completion of the game) would just elevate it greatly.

1. You cant destroy surroundings efficiently, in fact - no shellholes, you cant destroy floors and make enemy collapse.
2. Rifle bullets and shotgun lead (!!!) can break...brick walls. Really? (But they cant break floors, of course).
3.  No burning, no smoke emitting. I guess, when wall collapses - it produces a lot of dust, no?
4. Plot is nice. Simple - but nice. I like it. But it's being ruined by absolutely stupid balance and irrational math\behavior models - Xenonauts are supposed to be best of the best. Or, at least - just normal soldiers, no?) 
So when my ""best of the best"" soldiers start to panic and drop their rifle (!!!) and start to run away after receiving several shots from single enemy with 9mm SMG standing in formation with whole squad - well...that's...strange.
5. Same as p.4 - ""best of the best"" soldiers ready to shoot through their teammates and sometimes in calm situations cant event throw a nade through window in front of them. My kids can throw things better. 
(Yes, I know, I know - all this represents learning curve as units are ""green"" at start of story - but why not making all this ""failures"" more realistic?).
6. Variety of weapons? There is no variety of weapons. Only three types of weapon - close combat shotguns, rifles, ""support"" MG. During story you ll have SAME weapon - but only looking different with improved damage vs enemies. 
7. RPG element is not RPG at all - all shooting has fixed % of time units consumed. What means, that during story your units wont be able to behave in any new way - you ll have same number of shots forever. This is boring and irrational - I expect good, trained units to start pulling trigger faster, no?
8. Maps are boring - you ll never have a good close combat in highly urbanized areas - only open fields with strange looking ""trees"" (that doesnt burn, of course).

I would compain that the game is a bit too hard even on the easiest level. 
Soldiers would constantly die if you don't reload for like 10 times in a mission.
The budgeting is troublesome and you probably need to go to Excel instead of the game to figure out your P&L.
I really like the air missions with migs 31s and no spoilers, though it is still underdeveloped as they say.
The shoot outs are a bit primitive and I would compain on probability chances in shoot outs and grenade throws. If there is an obastacle on the floor the flying grenade might hit it. Kinda a bummer.

It attempts to mix OG and Firaxis XCOM aiming/to-hit systems in a way that is theoretically interesting but in practice a tedious game design shortcut that disproportionately punishes the player compared to the Aliens. The aiming system of this game treats any object between you and your target as ""cover"" essentially. A hip high wooden box between you and your (standing) target will incur a 40% aim penalty to the shot. An enemy you can see (from a slight angle) behind a full wall will have a 0% chance to hit. This makes no sense. Not only does someone not aim at someones entire silhouette, but many of these ""low cover"" objects do not even obscure 40% of someones body. The reason why low cover presents a cover bonus in XCOM 2 for instance is because the game is simulating an active battlefield. It is implied that your units are ducking in and out of cover to see and fire their weapons. Same situation with high cover, where your troops are peaking around a corner to see the things they need to see. So okay cover in this game is not relatable to the newer XCOM games, that's fine. I also like classic XCOM. This is not that either. The original XCOM games actually simulate a trajectory for a bullet to fly through your game world, resulting in actually understanding that anything in your cone of fire can and will get hit by your weapons, and that your %chance-to-hit is just the chance that your shot lands on the specific tile you are aiming for. It can miss and hit tiles behind, possibly still resulting in a hit on your target. In this game, your shots can only interact with the game world based on the %chances. If there is a ""low-cover"" object between you and a target you would have a 80% chance to hit without the object in the way, you will have a 40% chance to hit your target, 40% chance to hit (and damage) the low cover object, and 20% chance your shot transcends this plane of existence and does fuck all except render on your computer monitor in your darkly-lit bedroom at 2AM. Thankfully the game only takes the single highest accuracy reduction into account, unless there is a unit in the way as well. That is another 20% (crouching, idk if its the same when they stand in the way) reduction in your chance to hit, trading off for a 20% chance to hit that unit in the way. SO same analogy. 80% chance to hit without things in the way: 40% chance to hit the low-cover, 20% chance to hit a unit that is probably your friend, 20% chance to hit your enemy, 20% chance to continue enjoying those barbecue chips that have coated your fingers in a dark brown dust, without feeling anything as nothing changes in the game you have chosen to spend money and time on in this bleak world. Also weapons aren't well designed, and aliens (this example is actually an entirely human variant of the alien threat) which are allegedly not as good as your own soldiers (according the in-game wiki) can see and shoot you from farther that you can see or shoot them. ""Do they have some kind of sniper, or a DMR?"" No, they are using SMGs. ""Well then surely they must just be shooting what lead they can down-range?"" No, they will hit you more often than your rifles will hit them, from off screen. In general I don't like the effective ranges of weapons in this game. I get that an M16 or M4A1 realistically is effective at .5 KM and that this is a GAME simulating a much smaller environment, but the effective range of weapons (20 tiles for the assault rile [graphically and m4/m16]) is too short, especially when you factor in that weapons do not seem to actually get full accuracy within their effective range. Accuracy still drops every single tile from your unit, it just drops more past effective range. I could be wrong about this last point though. Accuracy is designed to be relatively low, similar to classic XCOM but I feel as though classic XCOM guns take a lot less time units, so you are shooting 2 or 3 aimed shots in a turn where you slightly moved instead of 2 or even just 1 aimed shot in X2 where you have not moved at all. Also LOS in this game is very deceptive, inconsistent, and blatantly wrong at times. These issues are fixable though. Buff chances to hit or increase time units, reduce the effects of cover, tweak aim/sight ranges. Not hard to completely fix this.

I do actually like this game in a lot of ways but I do not think the combat is engaging, fun, or even fair. I do not think it stands up to either UFO:D or TFTD, and while I don't find the newer XCOMs to be great comparisons as they are so very different, I can safely say they are a lot more fun and do what they are trying to do better. I only did a review so early in my theoretical length of play because the issues may keep me away from resuming my campaign. I'm sure there were a few more minor issues, but not all that impactful.

And I doubt it will ever change. Unlike the original X-Com (or UFO), this title is a full game of chances (like xcom from 2012, or xcom 2 or the first xenonauts). It just simply does not account for ""common sense"" in any way. Best example is throwing grenades... it says 100% but the soldier drops the grenade at his feet and kills himself and his buddies. As someone who was in the military, this ""feat"" is simply impossible. usualy this is the main source for your people dying. Next is, when your 90 accuracy (pretty high) rifleman can not hit at 4 squares away with 90% hitchanc in a straight line, but the enemy hits you for full damage twice in row with a shotgun that have just 30% hit chance. So when you play and engage in combat, you just pray that some RNG rolls in your favor and when not, you will curse. Besides that, the game is decent, though I do not realy like the art style.... reminds me of some cheap game from the 90s. Simply not adequate for 2024. Gues if they would get this sensless randomness under control... some RNG whatever, who cares, but at least it should make some sense ... a colonel sniper with 100% accuracy who cant hit... nah thanks. There are also some weird game mechanics... like an enemy run close and entered overwatch, then another enemy run there, triggered my overwatch, and that triggered the enemy overwatch and so my soldier died. Ehem yah. Whatever. There are definitely people who enjoy such things, I am not one of them.

This isn't very well sign-posted in the current iteration, with the game popping up a dialog when you hit around 200 days into the campaign where it declares the end of the currently implemented content. I think this could be better described to the player in advance.

Besides that, the game is in a generally good state. People familiar with the old X-COM: UFO Defense/UFO: Enemy Unknown will recognize the framework of the game, split between a 'Geoscape' strategic layer of base building, where the primary mechanics are dealing with the air war vs the aliens and managing resources for research, construction, and solidiers, and a tactical layer for turn based combat. Some features of the strategic layer seem to be more or less feature complete (base building, research/workshops), but others are in development (real-time UFO intercepts). 

The tactical layer seems to be in excellent shape. Maps have a variety of diversity, the actual combat mechanics feel really solid with a variety of options. What issues there are are primarily a function of the early state of the game and prioritization of features over balance. The game feels a bit too easy currently, with players having many tools to neutralize the alien threats (especially in what should be lethal situations, like breaching UFOs). Meanwhile the aliens never seem to be all that dangerous to the player. I think a big reason for this is the lack of alien area of effect weapons currently - I felt completely free to stack up 9 soldiers outside a UFO door without worry because I've never seen the aliens throw a grenade in the campaign. Presumably this is something which will be implemented in the future. 

As it stands now, the 'optimal' strategy seems to be relying heavily on shield soldiers to lead a push, with machine guns/grenades to destroy cover and suppress aliens, and flashbangs/smoke to add extra suppression/cover. Without more challenge/variety in alien tools/behavior the gameplay loop starts to get stale once the player has sufficient experience with these tools to make threats mostly nonexistent.

This game is largely unfinished, in the course of 10-11 hours once I got the mechanics / gameplay down I essentially ""beat the game"". Once you've finished all the missions, the devs state you can keep on playing but you're basically fighting off infinte respawn UFO's. You have the option of doing aerial combat and extracting wreckage for a small profit - or by investigating crash sites yourself and extracting more resources. The latter will allow you to engage in turn to turn combat. But at this state in the game, I played for a few more hours and grew bored. 

I leave a negative review, because the devs are charging quite a steep price for a game that's easily beatable in its short completed state. I don't think it's fair, and honestly will probably forget I purchased this and move on to other titles in the time they finish the game.

The original Xenonauts stands as the best alternative game to play if you don't want to be drowned by the blood pouring from your eye sockets after witnessing graphics, not that it takes away from such a legend of a game. So of course I was looking forward to Xenonauts 2 with anticipation, and am happy to say that I was absolutely enthralled for almost 20 hours of play(some offline time didn't add to my profile). I was sucked into the campaign and am excited to see what more they have to offer in the upcoming years. If the original Xenonauts is any indicative example, we've got a lot in store on the table. The sequel takes many ideas from the original and improves upon them, while also balancing and making game-play more tailored to new faces to turn based strategy. The content that I encountered has me giggling for joy, had me invested and excited to see where the game would take me - until it ended. yes, sadly this game has about 20 hours of play in a playthrough. Not to say that is bad, as every hour was filled with that classic Xcom/Xenonauts strategy that I do love so dearly. But, it would not be fair to brush off the content that is yet to be added in later times for the sake of rose tinted glasses. I'd say the content cuts out about halfway through the expected time frame for a run. Right when you get into the thick of research and development to really give it to the aliens. For me, I enjoyed my time and feel satisfied, and the promise of future content has me fulfilled for the time being. I do have a few jotted complaints to be improved upon though if a developer has to be lending a warranted ear:

-The cornering mechanic found in original Xenonauts is more absent than I would like to believe is 
intentional. I found the old mechanic to be helpful is positioning and very convenient to avoid reaction fire back in the previous title. Nowadays it seems to be more absent when a soldier is next to a full cover piece. Instead of corner peeking as it would in the original, it instead take line of sight head on, not allowing you a clear shot due to your own cover. This is quickly added onto by aliens being able to shoot AT you in that very same position, and soldiers being able to fire reaction shots unperturbed as well. 

-Some props on the map make little sense to me. In the city there are garden walls and picket fences that a soldier can see through but provide a lot of resistance when firing past it. It's almost aggrevating just how dislodging their cover values are when in all reality, a dinky barely scraped together wooden fence ain't gonna do jack against an alien plasma bold. I do understand penetration is not a thing in these games, but I only wish that maybe some assets be updated to seem more cover-like and less concealment-esc. Especially with those stupid garden wall things. You can see through them but they block the entire shot!

-The AI seems to struggle at times, with many aliens getting caught in their spawn areas, or acting strangely when faced with my soldier's approach. Some would face a corner in the room and almost seem to refuse human contact. Fair enough I guess, but shooting fish in a barrel isn't always the most challenging sport. I'm sure it's been noted already but it did hit me a little.

-Lastly, I do hope more UFO types are coming. the skies were mostly clouded with destroyers and little else by the time the content was ended. Though overall, I found the UFOs to be enjoyable and fun to face, similar to the original, even with that slight complaint.

Overall, a fun turn based strategy game. One that I will be checking on and throwing my support towards for times to come. If you are on the fence about getting it, I recommend trying it out. At the very least take a stabe at the original Xenonauts and give that glorious game a taste.

I'm on the fence on if I like how rare alloys and allenium are, since they are required for nearly everything it ensures I as a player must ration it very carefully and cannot, despite my best efforts, get good guns, good planes and good armour at the same time. Such a rarity of the resources does strongly help resist snowballing but also means if the player does not ration the resources properly even at lower difficulties they will at some point be hardlocked against superior enemies without the means to contend.

Taking an alien prisoner the first time for the research is quite fun but I have yet to find any reason to continue trying to take prisoners after the first one since I don't think they are useful for anything other than selling them. 

It would also be nice if capturing alien weapons (done by just deleting them all off the map with any means other than grenades) had some value beyond selling them and/or taking up storage space. I'd love to give them to the workshops to melt them down for scrap metal, especially since your own soldiers cannot equip them.

Air combat is very good, a bit hard to handle more than one plane with any type of finesse but that is more of a skill issue than a mechanical one. 
I would like it more if by destroying escourts such as probes and fighters (which by design do NOT generate a crash site battle but do give resource rewards such as alloys) but sparing the vehicle being escourted meant that they still left wreckage to recover. As it stands destroying escourts leave nothing unless the main ship is also sunk and subsequently secured. 

By the same notion it would be good if destroying an enemy raid with base defences also gave resources in the same way as shooting down and securing a ufo crash does. Maybe they already do but at this time I have no way of knowing.

Base defences are not particularly fun for me. While I do like that the aliens mostly spawn in the hangers, and that after 10 turns you get vision on all surviving aliens so you don't have to manually clear the entire facility. I would like to be able to spawn in places other than the elevator shaft. It would be nice to set up defencive positions in or near the hanger. It would make a nice role reversal where instead of being ambushed while running out of the helicopter, we are the ones ambushing a landing party. Though if they did go that route I'd want to not be able to see where the enemy spawns even if directly next to me (to give a risk factor) and to give the xenos the first turn.

I also have a problem with corners. I have had occasions where I knew an enemy was against a wall, but that I could not see, or attack, or frag, unless I step out from the corner/doorway myself. This nearly always results in overwatch fire and I have lost numerous xenonauts because of it. I'd like to be able to lean out or something to see around the corner and retain the cover bonus. Even if the enemy still gets to shoot it would theoretically give a way to advance cautiously rather than forcing the player to take an aggressive style with high risk simply because there is no other option.

Timers on missions
I don't mind them myself purely because the timers are not ALWAYS on missions. They are often long enough to complete the main and side missions without being overly reckless while also encouraging a more aggressive playstyle. They also come with rewards to make it worthwhile for the player to risk it so all in all, a well executed part of the game.

Camera angles
I have had multiple occasions where one of my units is in a very hard to see corner because there are obstructions on every side facing the camera. I have mostly circumvented this with a mild glitch that pauses the camera rotation halfway between two points letting me see down hallways straight rather than on an angle, so I am hopeful they add these camera angles in as standard down the line.


All in all, some work still needs to be done, ((which they say they have more things they want to add and improve so I have reasonable expectations that their objectives will be reached)) but even with the shortcomings it is still an aesthetically pleasing, smooth running, challenging (without being torturous) stable game and I was happy to pay full price for it.

https://youtu.be/A17rVbNTtrg?si=fqbjdDgJnoeNrAVx

In the annals of the cosmic fray, a saga unfurls,
A neophyte agent, amidst alien whirls.
Unconditioned, in the esoteric domain,
Where shadows cast veils, and mysteries remain.
Veterans' lexicon, a dialect old,
Phrases arcane, from tales untold.
A baptism in the paranormal tide,
To hunt the unknown, where shadows bide.
In epic stellar resonance, the narrative commences,
A new feller an agent uninitiate, fate dispenses.
UFOs loom, celestial chariots high,
The unconditioned agent stares, to the cosmic sky.
Phenomena elusive, as words unfold,
A clandestine dance, in mysteries untold.
Capturing saucers, in the midnight realm,
The unconditioned agent enters the cosmic helm.
Interrogation chambers, where alien minds unfold,
In quest for knowledge, a tale to be told.
Black market dealings, where secrets conspire,
Funds from shadows, to fan the unknown fire.
Shadow government, in puppeteer's guise,
A clandestine maestro, orchestrating the skies.
Funds flowing like rivers, in the dark cosmic stream,
Unconditioned agent navigates the shadow's dream.
Secret bases overrun, by invaders unknown,
A war of atomic proportions, in shadows sown.
Deserts and strange places, the battleground vast,
The unconditioned agent strides, shadows cast.
Russia's vastness, a cosmic frontier,
Where secrets linger, in the cosmic sphere.
Unknown threats, a dance in starlit ballet,
The unconditioned agent wades, in shadows' sway.
Jupiter Olympic organization, a shield held high,
Against extraterrestrial foes, a cosmic battle cry.
People from the world, in unison's might,
Fighting the unknown unknown, in the cosmic night.
Epic struggles, in terrains bizarre,
Where heroes fall, like a distant star.
A tapestry woven, in verses of strife,
A saga of sacrifice, in the cosmic life.
Through cosmic odyssey, secrets unfold,
In the vast expanse, where destinies hold.
A requiem sung, for the brave and the true,
In the cosmic symphony, where stars imbue.

WARNING : SPOILERS AHEAD, TREAD LIGHTLY

      The original Xenonauts was one of the best Turn-Based strategy games that I have ever played. Despite its minor jankiness and arguably low quality graphics, it blended together the feeling of fighting against an alien invasion very well as both air and ground superiority being a must in fighting off the invaders. This is something that similar games (*cough* XCOM 2 *cough*) do not possess. Like its predecessor, Xenonauts 2 pulls this off very well. The art style maintains the same level of quality, though it is different enough that it stands out. The ground combat has been overhauled and made much better, as the in-game graphics look much better, the sound design is much improved, the grenade tweaks (mainly the removal of the time-delay), and the differentiation of different weapons. Unlike Xenonauts 1, where weapon tiers were simply better than those previously, weapons actually have differences now (small differences, but its something). 
    Accelerated weapons do slightly more damage and armor penetration than ballistics, but are costly and require alien 
    alloys.
    Lasers do much more damage and armor destruction, but hold less ammo. However, these can be upgraded to 
    regenerate ammo and do more damage.
    Gauss weapons are direct upgrades to accelerated, with much more damage and armor penetration.
Environmental destruction has also been focused on much more than in Xenonauts 1. The addition of demolition charges allows you and your squad to destroy structures and flora (sometimes even fauna) in a much more controlled manner, which increases your tactical options tenfold. 
      I can't really cover everything that I like about this game, the majority of it is amazing and a major upgrade from the original. One of the things that I do like the most, however, is the implementation of human enemies (AKA The Cleaners). While the story behind them is just ok (like the rest of the game's story) what I mainly like about them is that they give an extra flair to the invasion. There is a major difference between just shooting a gray and when you have to engage in combat with another red-blooded human. This is fully encapsulated on the raid in the cleaner's main base, where you have to fight against humans using your own technology (accelerated weapons, sentry turrets, etc.) that you have likely used in combat against the alien invaders. As part of the raid, you gain access to the ability to manufacture both Alienium and Alien Alloys, despite the expensive cost. This brings me to another major feature that I like, is addition of idle workshops / laboratories generating income. Its a nice QoL feature that allows you to build and field more aircraft / soldiers / bases, but it still places emphasis on keeping panic low because of the massive payouts from your monthly income compared to the amounts that your workshops can produce.
      One of the things that I think is almost entirely worse than the original game is the air combat. It is being worked on, but currently it is either A. Broken (Unlikely) or B. I am bad at it (Likely). I do like the new gear, armor, and actual choice in weapons that you can fit on the aircraft, but in my play through it made little difference as my planes were regularly major damage from mid-game UFOs even with all of the armor upgrades and weapon combinations that I could fit onto them. This was in auto-resolve combat. Manual air combat is honestly horrible and a complete downgrade from the original game. With UFOs having either a massive attack range, massive attack damage, or both it makes the combat extremely unfun to play and most of the time downs both aircraft when auto-resolve would have caused them to only get damaged.

| TL;DR |
     Overall, despite the air combat, the game is much better then the original. The disappointment with the vehicles has been fixed in the form of the M.A.R.S. (only equip with default btw cannon+accuracy sucks). Verticality has had a massive upgrade, with enemies sometimes spawning on the 2nd floor, ladders, and an actual reason to be on the 2nd or 3rd floor (two words, roof camp). The base-building has been massively overhauled, with an emphasis on logical construction in the form of adjacency and base-assaults. It has been a blast playing this game, and I look forward to its full release.

[h2] Overview [/h2]
This is still very much Xenonauts, the fundamentals of the the game are identical to the prequel, but with a plethora of quality of life and general gameplay improvements. The jump to 3D is the first obvious change and while i didn't find myself using it all too often, it was still a massive addition. Returning fans will notice a lot of reused content, the premise and plot are identical apart from the aforementioned improvements and there's still plenty missing at the time of writing.

[h2] Early Access [/h2]
This is still a obviously a WIP and the devs aren't shy of reminding you, which is refreshing and certainly tempers expectations. The main issues I've seen so far are movement glitches ([spoiler] primarily with jetpacks [/spoiler]), RNG oddities and map generation related bugs (that have only affected visuals so far). 

[h2] Should you buy it? [/h2]
As someone who loved the original XCOM and Xenonauts, this is just a massive overall improvement of the core mechanics and I can see a very robust and scale-able platform for the devs to make a great game with time. It's pricey for the amount of content that exists right now (Dec 23) but if you're a fan of the franchise, it's a definite must-buy. For those who're interested in the game, I'd recommend getting the original for now, and coming back to this in a few months when it's further fleshed out.",1702237705,1702237705,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[b]Advice on Playing the First Game:[/b] The developers seem to have designed the game in such a way that playing the first installment in the series is important for understanding and enjoying the current version. They might also support or encourage the use of mods (modifications) to enhance the gaming experience.

[b]Desire to Be Involved in Alpha Testing:[/b] The text reflects a wish to have been involved in the alpha testing phase of the game's development. This indicates the game is in its early stages and suggests a high level of interest from the gaming community in its development process.

[b]Technical Issue During Tutorial:[/b] There appears to be a technical problem where players are unable to exit the tutorial without forcibly closing the game using the Alt+F4 command. This issue suggests a potential oversight or bug during the development phase.

[b]Rapid Discovery of a Gameplay Issue:[/b] The rapid discovery of a problem within two minutes of gameplay points to either a significant issue that the developers might have missed or an exceptionally observant player base.

[b]Ambivalence Towards the Game's Current State:[/b] Despite identified issues, there is an expression of affection for the game. However, there's hesitation in recommending it to others in its current form, implying that the game may have bugs or incomplete features that the developers are still working on.

[b]Comparisons with Other Classic Games:[/b] The game is compared to classic titles like the original DOS version of XCOM and ""Terror from the Deep."" The mention of ""OpenXCom"" and its praised features implies that the developers might have drawn inspiration from these older games or that the community sees similarities in them.

[b]Remarks on the Game’s Testing Status:[/b] The game is noted to still be in a testing phase, indicating ongoing development. The comment questioning how someone unfamiliar with the first game became interested in this one might suggest that the developers are targeting fans of the series or genre specifically.

The economic system is far better, air combat was kind of fun, the game is better balanced better and while the weight isn't as realistic as before it's still pretty great. 

However, it suffers HEAVILY from a number of game breaking bugs, notably that way too many things block your vision basically making sections unplayable. You will have to go back and replay, replay, and replay to make it possible to see what thing you can clearly see through you can shoot through but the enemy can't. Like before, the enemy has a longer sight radius than you and can always get the first shot, and shooting the enemy rarely removes overwatch before making aggressive combat kind of impossible. You will basically NEED to replay over and over again and play defensively in a rather cheap way to keep testing if you can shoot around a wall. What's worse is you can often see the target, but the new shooting system won't let you hit them, but sometimes the enemy can hit you. How many times this game reduces your accuracy to 0% is absurd. It's way higher than before. Range of weapons should increase quite a bit and vision. 

The game adds a lot of great features, for example training so your troops can train inside the base. In this way if you've simply had a lot of downtime, progression is still more natural. Money is a lot nicer and unlike the first game, countries don't abandon you nearly as quickly, with the pacing and progression being far more lenient, fun and less boring, with things moving faster while also slow enough paced to give you a grasp on things. It has a lot of neat features you will only  get to use later on which is annoying but typical of games like this. However, with the game-breaking bugs or problem of not being able to shoot enemies right in front of you and always having your shot blocked by the tiniest of things, it's really not polished enough imo to be considered developed. It's a fun playthrough but get ready for it to be REALLY frustrating, not due to hard but balanced battles or even unbalanced battles, but just ridiculous nonsense like not being able to hit things because a palm tree you can see through blocks your ability to fire 100%. In this game you basically can't shoot around corners, which is the bread and butter of tactical games like this, so you can't hide behind cover when shooting at the enemy most of the time given the incredibly poor LOS system. Accuracy is bad in all X-com related games, but this is so bad it's almost unplayable in sections. That also being said, I was able to mod some of these features myself by going in to the game files and reading the files with notepad, and you can modify simple things like weight or damage which can compensate a bit. I decided to increase grenade and grenade launcher damage both due to it leaving the enemy with exactly 2 health most times (no really, it does this every time which is annoying, just increase the damage by 10 more and it guarantees they'll die) and bizarrely low accuracy. The way it is on release it needs massive improvements to the fundamental parts of the game, but all the other stuff like the economy, training, logistics, etc. are all actually great. Maps are bigger than last time and so are UFO's, which makes it actually playable to clear out a UFO unlike the only xenonauts. I can't wrap my head around why they added a new shooting system which is game-breaking, but other than that it's really well done. This one simple thing needs to change; perhaps cover is removed within 2 tiles of you, or perhaps you make it so you can shoot as if your head is leaning around the corner or something to fix it?

Sure it still has some work to do, some features to be improved and content to be added, BUT right now it is better than X1, so everything else will just be further improvements. 

Bravo. 



Right now, I'd say go play X1, it is a far superior game in practically every way (Despite what the devs say). Maybe in the future X2 could be great, but the mid to late game is a horrible slog fest. Recent changes have practically nerfed any method of making money meaning you are just being inevitably ground down late game.

[h2] Quick Review [/h2]
Xenonauts 2 finally lands in Early Access after an eternity. Played for an hour, it's basically the Original Xenonauts with a 3D makeover. Not gonna lie, was hoping for more. Was thinking we'd get some cool upgrades or lessons learned from the first game. Nope, not really feeling it.
[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
The question is ""Will Xenonauts 2 bounce back from Early Access and be a game-changer?"" Your guess is as good as mine.
If you're new to Xenonauts, I'd say stick with the classic and mods, and maybe hold off on this until it gets its act together.",1701436362,1701466037,False,17,0,0.621261775493621826,0,True,False,True

The computer AI will shoot through solid walls displayed by graphics and sometimes you can shoot through them, many times you cant despite being shot at by the AI. I am not sure using cover works properly because the AI seldom misses wether you are behind cover, on the opposite side of smoke, or just running in the open. AI control of friendlies is also terrible, friendlies run toward aliens, make no effort to move away from the blood shed but instead just aimlessly wander about. Generating of recruitable soldiers is difficult because of the huge amount of horrible stats on most and maybe 1 usable out of the 20 or so choices you have. It wouldn't be so bad if so many soldiers didn't get wounded or killed each mission because again, the AI rarely misses. If you played Xenonaught 1, then you're not really getting anything new here, its pretty much the same game with some minor tweaks. You can move the camera around which allows you to see things from different angles which is nice. The shooting in the game really leaves A LOT to be desired. I am not sure what calculations they use for their random numbers generator but they are pretty horrible. The game will keep you entertained for a bit but it is questionable wether its worth the money. I spent about 72 hours with it until I just got so fed up with the horrible shooting mechanics that I had enough. In all fairness I did give it several tries before I got fed up with the mechanics.

The developers have managed to strike a perfect balance between preserving the essence of the original and introducing fresh, modern elements.

One of the standout features is the meticulous attention to detail in the strategic layer. The geopolitical landscape feels more dynamic than ever, adding a layer of complexity to decision-making. The sense of urgency and the constant need to adapt to evolving threats kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the game.

The tactical combat is where Xenonauts 2 truly shines. The turn-based battles are intense and tactical, requiring careful planning and execution. The diverse range of alien adversaries keeps the gameplay engaging, and the variety of environments adds an extra layer of challenge. The improved graphics and animations contribute to a visually appealing and immersive experience.

I appreciate the depth of customization available for both soldiers and equipment. Building and upgrading my squad felt like assembling a well-oiled machine, and the satisfaction of seeing my strategies pay off in the heat of battle was immensely rewarding.

The developers have also shown a commitment to community feedback, actively refining and polishing the game through updates. This dedication to improvement speaks volumes about their commitment to delivering a top-notch gaming experience.

In summary, Xenonauts 2 is a must-play for fans of the strategy genre. It successfully marries nostalgia with innovation, offering a challenging and satisfying experience that will keep you hooked from start to finish.

Never knowing what dangers were waiting in each mission filled me with dread during each loading screen before the Skyranger touched down. Many of my most memorable gaming moments came from UFO Defense. The exhilaration after knocking my first UFO out of the sky has never been outdone. Or the initial shock at first spotting a Chryssalid that soon devolved into panic and terror as I realized what the creatures were capable of. Or the satisfaction after finally delivering some retribution by conducting experiments on living alien captives. 

For me, UFO Defense's lack of introduction gave me a sense that I was truly alone in defending the planet from doom. Nobody was going to hold my hand by telling me the most important research path. My soldiers could never be trusted to collect the right equipment before a mission, a lesson that has served me well when managing employees in the real world. 

Some 20 years later, I played Enemy Unknown. The game was fantastic and truly brought the concept to life. But I felt like something was missing. I felt like I was not fully in control and I did not feel like I was, personal, the only hope for Earth. 

Then last week I installed Xenonauts 2 and was transported back to a world and an experience I truly love. It is true that the game is not done yet, but Xenonauts 2 has all of the ingredients to be my favorite game of all time. It scratches an itch that no other game comes close to reaching. The perfect blend of game elements like grand strategy, research and development, mystery, tense tactical battles, cool guns, awesome explosions, RPG character development for my own private army, a taste of shock and grief after losing all 9 soldiers in one mission. 

There are endless interesting decisions that Xenonauts 2 allows you to make, and the answers are often found in many different ways. Do I research better weapons or armor first? Do I advance with the MARS combat platform to draw fire away from the men, knowing that the vehicle is 20 times more expensive than the private who just joined the squad yesterday? 

I can see how a $40 price tag might not be an easy investment for some gamers.

The full game is not complete, but there's a good chunk of the mechanical content I expect to see in an XCOM successor. Xenonauts 2 is a fun reimagining of Xenonauts 1, who itself was a worthy spiritual successor to the original XCOM series from the 1990s. 

The move to 3D was a good choice and is aesthetically pleasing. The equipment changes/balance changes give some weight to decisions beyond the standard XCOM template of ""get new weapon tier."" Maybe I'm just bad at the game, but I did feel pressure to fund either my air war (incomplete mechanic, so judgement pending here) or my ground war more. The cost of aircraft and components is steep, but the cost of failing to intercept UFOs is steeper. You can always hire more soldiers.

The reimagination of the lore gives the game's premise a bit more grounding (pun intended) and you ask fewer questions in the vein of, ""Why didn't they just send the biggest UFOs they had lol?"" and, ""Why don't they just kill us all outright?""

Overall the ground equipment available gives a lot of tactical flexibility and I didn't feel AS penned into the roles the way you are in other XCOM successors. Yes, my soldier with a sniper rifle is not breaking down doors typically, but they are not useless if the assault element dies. 

The ONLY negative thing I can think to say about Xenonauts 2 is the behavior of the aliens in crashed UFOs hasn't changed much and there's a lack of dynamic behavior there that I think is a missed opportunity.",1699472062,1699472062,True,10,0,0.636291384696960449,0,True,False,True

I have played 27 hours so far so obviously I like it. At the same time I agree with a lot of the negative comments.
Pros:
I haven't had any crashes
The game has been improved in some areas
I like that the new robots only take up 1 spot and they just limit how many you can have on the ship.
A lot like Xenoaunts 1
Cons:
A lot like Xenoaunts 1, I was hoping more of a X-Com terror from the depth to the game. (Went from land to water battles) 
The aliens are very similar, they only changed a few of them and keep some exactly the same
for all the developing very similar to Xenoaunts 1.

At this point if you really want to play a slightly different game pay the $30-$40 support the company. But honestly I would either wait the 9 months they said for the updates, or wait for it to go on sale for like $15-$20.

Some notable changes: 
+ Enemies no longer have a superior sight range,meaning you don't get sniped constantly by things you can't see
+ Combat in general feels more fair,soldiers (usually) don't die in one shot,but enemies are more numerous
+ The AI no longer cheats,previously it could see you through walls
+ Aliens no longer camp in the same spot and are more aggressive,resulting in more engaging gameplay
+ Soldiers are easier to replace
+ Alien types are actually unique now
+ Different weapon tiers have more differences than just bigger numbers
+ You can rotate the camera!!!!!!
- You no longer get to field tanks
- There seems to be a lot less focus on the air aspect of the game,previously planes were a top priority
- A large portion of the enemies spawns right outside the dropship,meaning the fight is very intense at the start,while the rest of the map is relatively empty

Xenonauts 2 here continues the first's design philosophy and purpose. Lots of steam reviewers are dismissing it as being no different than the original or claim its the original given a fresh coat of paint... Having played Xenonauts 2 for over 50 hours myself, I can tell these are quick impressions based on visuals alone. Most of Goldhawk Interactive's efforts to make the sequel better than the original have been put into the engine aiming for a better mix of modern/up to date features while retaining a classic, familiar 1994 X-com look and feel. Their efforts may have been too effective given all the lazy negative 'its just a remake!' reviews. Remake or not, improvements over the first game are undeniable.

Honestly Xenonauts 1 & 2 reminds me a lot of Civ 1 & 2 where the sequel looks and plays better, but there's not a whole that sets the two apart making the 'same with a fresh coat of paint' opinions stick. However, the sequel is the superior version essentially being better at what the original was shooting for.

Even if Xenonauts 2 comes across as a remake to you, it is graphically superior to 1. Not a mind blowing improvement, but Xenonauts 1's pixel work looks a combination of quaint and primitive in comparison (IMHO, Xeno1 looks like crap). Also, you can rotate the camera in Xenonauts 2 during ground missions. Can't do that in Xenonauts 1! This game is a distinct improvement over the original is what I'm getting at.

At the time of this review, Xenonauts 2 is still somewhere early-mid development. What's available now is a beta: it's completely playable, but incomplete overall. So far its shaping up pretty well.

Worth picking up if you're looking to play something similar to 1994 X-Com. Also worth picking up if you liked Xenonauts 1. Again, even if #2 comes across as a remake to you, it's an improved version of the original.

It is the same aside from a handful of new things and taking place in 2009. 

OG X-Com had a jet VToL (Sky Ranger) in 1999 but we still driving a chopper in 2009.

The major thing that gets me is that no one in the game seems to be aware of the Xenonauts from the first game, the first invasion or the fact we had Magnetic weapons back in the late 70s early 80s.

I was expecting a sequel (Terror from the Deep), something like that.

There should be:
Xenonauts: CE (Community Edition)
Xenonauts 1 (Xenonauts 2)

I remain confused, why or how they can call this Xenonauts 2, implying a sequel, when it is in no way a sequel. Really strange and some what deceiving.

Edit: Update - So a little further in they mention the Ice Land incident. 
+ Rotating Camera
+ You can sell corpses again on the necrophiliac market
- No mention of the past war 
- Mostly same aliens 

Not a sequel - I expected it to be a sequel. 
Still fun


Update: after reaching ""The end on content"" after about 15 hours. It tells me I can keep playing but no more research or alien craft. Everything will remain the same..

What I don't understand is that this game has been in development for almost a decade, and it is a re-imagining of their previous game... and to me id say 20% of the content is complete... so at this rate the game will be finished in 32 years.. awesome

Why would they spend 8 years re-imagining something instead of creating a true sequel.. I have no idea. Also you would think that with it being a re-imagining, things would move quicker. Seems to me that they would already have most of the foundation and premise in place, and work on nothing but enhancements and additions.

Pros:
1. I love the concept and it is very reminiscent of X-Com and other games of a similar genre. Weapon loadout customization is neat where you can choose however many munitions and explosives you want.
2. Angling your troops for vision is an interesting concept but this comes with a caveat...
3. World map is neat and the ability to make other bases are cool.
4. Aliens are neat looking and distinct from each other.

Cons:
1. Combat is absolutely frustrating and unrewarding. Granted, I am still in the early game, but I cannot see a reason to keep playing the game if the combat is like this. Each xenonaut has an amount of Turn Points or Action points based off their stats and gear, which creates individuals of different caliber and tier. 
Turn Points are spent on any action the xenonauts make, whether that means TURNING your character in a specific direction, firing your weapon, crouching, etc. Turning your character for vision in itself is an interesting concept except for when your character otherwise does not react to something that could literally be right next to them. You can call that a balance decision and ""tactical"" but it makes no sense for you to spend points to look from left to right. I can't count how many times you will LOSE soldiers because an enemy comes at the every edge of your vision cone and wipes you out. 
You can never enter an area without getting shot at first and potentially just losing your xenonaut because someone is hiding out of vision - you CANNOT PEEK from corners which is ridiculous. If you want to fire around a corner, you need to move your xenonaut in the open, risk overwatch fire, fire (and potentially miss), and hope you have enough action points to return without taking overwatch fire again.
Weapon and utility skills all cost action points but depending on the type of action you are making, it is either percentage based or a set rate. Meaning it doesn't matter if your xenonaut has 90 turn points versus your other xenonaut with 55 because he can only do one thing (if anything) after moving. It just means one xenonaut can move further than the other which is extremely disappointing.
Overwatch fire reactions (you dodging a reaction shot) is based on the percentage of action points you have left on your character which is both interesting...and terrible. Meaning that if you have no Turn Points remaining, you are more susceptible from enemy fire. All enemies, upon first encounter, will have reaction fire shots on you as soon as you enter their field of vision (cone) which will happen 100% of the time as you leave a corner, or you didn't kill them outright and they fire right back at you. And if you want to have overwatch fire, you need to make sure you have enough action points for any sort of shot you can make. If you do not have enough, you don't do anything.
Hit rates are abysmal for the player. As mentioned before if you are huddled behind ""high"" cover"", you cannot shoot around the corner. It is a 0% chance to hit. Or if you have anything in the way of your target, even if logically you are shooting over a darn cone, it will affect your hitrate by -25% (this is for each obstacle in the way). But your enemies will almost ALWAYS hit you. Cover does not help you in the slightest, and it might as well not even be there. High ground, cover, and crouching doesn't help you either. You have to pop up to shoot someone. but they can see you and shoot you even if you don't have vision of them because you crouched. It does not make sense at all. Shields also suck. They are great for one or two engages and then that xenonaut is anything but useless afterwards.
2. Too many stats. You can gush over all the complexities and ""possibilities"" with stat generation however many times you want, but one single stat being sub 50 in anything wrecks your xenonaut completely. Anything below 50 hp is guaranteed death in one shot by most enemies, anything below 50 reflex means you are swiss cheese to any overwatch fire, etc. 
3. Playing missions do not feel rewarding enough for the amount of frustration you will endure from losing your troops or from the game mechanics. You get a ton of funds early and can even custom set the difficutly too (but why would you do that to make it easier). It makes it abundantly clear to you that you will be losing troops A LOT. But then comes the problem of why am I leveling up these troops if they don't improve at all by going on missions and getting promoted? At best they will get a +2 increase to some of their stats at the end of mission log...which is nothing. Plus 2 HP for a xenonaut with 50 hp doesn't make them any more tankier. Medals are something that are given out too....for +1 stat points in all attributes. It doesn't make an impact whatsoever. They still get one-tapped from out of vision or from an angle that should have been impossible to hit because you couldn't make the same shot from where you were, they still can't hit anything, and they still can't carry anything. The fact I can still miss or get a sub 80% hit chance with a shotgun 2 tiles away and still miss everything is really frustrating...and don't even get me started on shotgun range.
4. Gives us the option to send multiple dropships to a single mission. We can have multiple in the base anyway so why not take two? 9 xenonauts would normally feel like a lot if you are used to X-Com but it means absolutely nothing. You are always outnumbered, you are not playing with troops with special abilities or passives, and more often than not you have a turn limit or turn timer before reinforcements arrive. With how many casualties you will get after each mission (unless you are somehow very lucky), you might as well have more troops to help you out. There is no stealth aspect to this game either. The enemy already knows you are there and rush your position immediately. It doesn't make sense to only send 9 men into a heavily fortified base with an average of 17 enemies with more reinforcements coming at turn 5 when you have two dropships that can send 18 in total. It honestly would not kill the balance of the game, especially on harder difficulties where nearly every hit taken is a headshot/instant kill.

Conclusion: I really want to upvote this game, but I am struggling to keep playing it for more than one mission at a time, if at all. I will take another look at it after some time has passed but as it stands right now, I can't recommend this game. I find myself more frustrated than I am finding it fun which shouldn't be what you are feeling when you are playing a video game. Frustration from trying to solve a puzzle, learning a new strategy, or beating a boss is all part of playing games because there is a feeling of improvement or reward afterwards, but this is not the same thing.",1697501912,1697501912,False,18,2,0.546730220317840576,0,True,False,True

Tactical combat is still very much luck based with % hit chances that truly take all the skill out of the game.  Spend an entire turn or two to setup high hit chance attacks, just to miss while the enemy crush you despite multiple layers of cover from long distance.  It makes all the ""skill"" feel like luck... because it is a ton of luck.  

Atrocious job on how cover works.  Being a few degrees off direct cover is enough to make the cover worthless, even though conceptually (and how other games do it) is it then turns more to partial cover as you get around to shoot.  This 90% of the time will benefit AI over you, since they don't care a lot to use cover.  To be fair, AI doesn't need to use cover since your trained military soldiers are absolutely terrible shots (especially at lower levels).

Worst of all is the use of fog and line of sight.  It's such a troll job of a game design.  Since you can't peak around corners you have no choice but to move into it, to get shot up, or waste valuable move points to get back into cover.  Plus there is the fact enemies will wait in rooms doing nothing just camping.  Leaving you with no option to scrub load that b.s. or take a death as you breach a room with a hidden enemy in it that's casually and silently just chilling while an entire gun fight happens next door.  

Overall it's way overpriced for the quality, I'd say don't spend more than $15 if you really like tactical games like x-com. And for others don't spend more then 8-10.

Base building in general is awesome! Suiting up and arming soldiers is good as well. Love the Engineering and science dynamic which lends to decisions that may affect outcomes based on how you proceed. This varying degree of outcomes has often lead to great games.

While it is really similar to XCOM ( setting, objectives and gameplay), the RNG and the ""physics"" feels better. You don't miss that often those 75% chance shot, as in XCOM were I often felt cheated (i don't know how many 95% chance shot i've missed). 

Lines of sight make a lot of more sense and you'll need to be cautious on how you place your men.

The base building, is far better than XCOM. 

Managing your squad and loadouts is really interesting, and you are not lock into a class system. Anyone can use any gun. The wierd part for me is the squad size. Its not a downside, but starting with 9 soldiers could be somewhat overwhelming for someone who has never played before. 

Graphics aren't gonna blow you away, but I wasn't a fan of the cinematic look of XCOM so personally its not an issue.

From what I've read, the downvotes are from people who feel ripoff cause the game itself isn't enough an improvement from the first game. Well I haven't played the first game, and this one is great. So far they have a clear roadmap to keep improving the game. 

All in all, it is the kind a game i'll find myself sinking, arguably too many hours in. Thumbs up!",1696798718,1696798718,True,2,0,0.50548243522644043,0,True,False,True

Only slightly better than Xenonauts 1.
It's more of a remake, not actually a new game.

Long version:
Imagine if they continued developing Xenonauts 1 a bit longer, this is probably what they wouldve arrived at.
It is in no way different enough to be considered a ""new game.""
Same concept, same combat system, identical aerial combat system (inc graphics) same enemies, almost the same weapons etc.
The main differences are more modern graphics, and a slightly smoother GUI (in some places, some are identical to the original)
Having said that, the game is not complete yet so I dont know what is in store for the final version...

I was a bit frustrated with the placeholder text and images. Literally, instead of including a rough draft of a description they just wrote ""Placeholder Text"" with absolutely no info at all. 
The combat maps also got a bit repetitive, I ended up playing the same tactical map 3 times, so having a wider range of maps or possibly some element of randomly generated terrain would be nice.
I would like to be able to target an area with the grenade launcher, to take out walls etc, having to target an enemy with line of sight (the same way normal guns do) for something which deals area damage like a grenade just doesnt seem right.

I bought the first ver a year ago and had a real problem rebinding keys, loved the game but was unable to find the trick to re-bind keyboard (being lefty it was a must to have keys set up...obviously I don't excel in this area )  Steam was kind enough to grant me a refund- but I was bummed- had the Xeno itch .. and no way to scratch.
 Spent some time on Utube watching reviews and game play for X2- I noticed the Dev's made the options menu nice and ... standardy ? Like most games - standard key binding.. graphics options, etc. I mean as players we all want more from Dev's, and it's really a win- win when they come through. And when they don't- it's our job to hammer them and send the message. I tried support, forums etc... But when you can't even bind your keys, and all the reviews rave about the game, and no, or very little mention of key binding problems- I knew it must be my ineptness.. Gotta work on that ! 
At an rate- I have about 8 hrs in with X2 - Solider diff. level, 2 play throughs. 1st went 50 days. Had a blast getting my a## kicked around the map by these lil buggers. Great base bld concept. But I think could've been 3D or at least have more depth. Air combat/ management / research - all fits very well into game flow and purpose, but misses for me on graphics, sound, strategy limitations, dimension, and some times AI balance. But I gotta say the rest of the game makes up for it. A great mix of strategy and management. A good pace to story line, with moments of key seeking panic, followed by contemplative chin rubbing strategics. 2nd play thru in prog- 60 some days, not looking good. Lil F#$^% are buzzing around like flies. Thinking of restart- but my troops! They're all buff! 
The value in loosing in X2 is learning quickly.... ""Yeah.. ok. So don't do that."" Stay on top of funding.. etc. Combat is fun, engaging, and the leveling is a cool feature that makes the troops more than fodder. Research is well paced with AI difficulty. If you stay on track here you won't be out gunned. I had no bug issues, game played perfectly. Music is great - timely, suspenseful. Graphics are old school, very well done, but.. yeah  if you're looking for high end graphics I recommend you watch some reviews for X2 first.

Me: SOLD!!!!

I've been playing this on maximum difficulty for a few hours now, and it's very doable. I'd characterize the tactical combat as more forgiving than the original game, while still having the same overall style of gameplay. Here's a few tips to get through the fights.

1. Don't play Iron Man unless you've beaten this or are okay with your run getting trashed due to a small mistake. This game is a tactical challenge, and you WILL make errors.

2. It's okay to customize your difficulty settings to alleviate time pressure and turn limits in missions. The only reason I'm not doing that is because I'm extremely familiar with Xenonauts gameplay. Being able to go slow and defeat the xenos in detail will help you figure out all the tactical positioning you'll need to do it faster. You can make it more challenging when you're ready.

3. Get armor upgrades for your soldiers ASAP. Weapon upgrades next. Training soldiers with 80+ TUs, Strength, and Accuracy will make your life much easier.

4. Despite what some people always swear by, shields are useless most of the time. An assault with a shotgun is almost always better. Don't bring a shield unless you're assaulting a type of landed UFO where you know you'll need it to keep a soldier from dying during breach. You can reload a save pre-mission and just add a shield in if need be, all it costs is time and you'll know what UFO type to bring it for in the future.

5. Aliens have the same time unit restrictions you do. Positioning, cover, and distance can cause the aliens to waste most of their turn and create openings for you. In open terrain, riflemen and heavies are the strongest. In complex environments assault can really shine. Snipers are okay-ish, but you should never take more than one on a team. They're a specialist unit, and are better in the early game than the late due to time unit mechanics. Being able to ping a xeno at 100% is a clutch move in early missions, but they only shoot once. Meanwhile, a high level rifleman with 80+ accuracy can shoot three times in a turn with acceptable accuracy. 

This game will punish you for being reckless, but it's not a 'gotcha' game that will punish you for just playing it. If you like games that offer a sincere challenge you can overcome through planning and guile, this is the game for you.",1693449458,1693449458,True,30,1,0.55872797966003418,2,True,False,True

This game has been in development for at least four years, yet it is nowhere near finished.  There are many unfinished sections or ""unpolished"" as the developers call it, but here's one example: my fourth research item had no description!  Nothing at all.

This ""unfinished"" nature is particularly glaring in the plot.  After all these years in development, I was expecting something interesting, developed and complex.  However, the plot could have been written on your way to the grocery store: aliens are trying to ""get"" the humans.  The End.  How many more years will it take for some subtlety or creativity?  The X-COM games Xenonauts emulates at least provide a particular atmosphere: creepy, mysterious danger.  There is no mystery or creepiness here, just an enemy to fight.

In addition, balance is way off.  I've played every X-COMish game there is.  I am good.  My first five missions went as expected, some causalties here and there, some heavy hitters.  But within five hours of playing, a ""Cleaner"" base mission pops up.  I send a full squad, latest gear.  They were wiped out within the first five rounds.  I barely even located the objective.  Now, caveat: if it had been indicated somewhere, ANYWHERE, that this was a really tough mission, I might have prepared better or simply waited until my tech was better.  But there was zero indication that this was a supremely tough mission, a glaring omission.

There are some good points, though.  It is apparent most time and attention was spent on the tactical combat.  Animations are smooth, graphics are nice and the UI has much thought behind it.  But even the UI is pretty basic, with a heavy emphasis on tooltip popups to explain everything, instead of allowing the UI to explain itself with helpful icons or text.

This is what I'll say: Xenonauts 2 is both more and less forgiving than the original. More, in that you get various little aids like the game telling you when you haven't moved a soldier; less, in that the local militaries are (as of Patch 1.30) completely useless. More, in that you get the cool stuff quicker; less, in that you need the cool stuff faster. You catch my drift. However, the game still is incredibly difficult for those who aren't used to losing their entire squad; imagine early-game XCOM Iron Man runs, but you die that easily basically for the entire game. The way you win gunfights is by shooting first.

However, that doesn't mean the game isn't fun (especially on lower difficulties to alleviate some of the frankly BS alien accuracy).

This game is still very much in early access. When I said earlier that I played Xenonauts 2 to the fullest extent I could, I meant that. The game's campaign is not done and a lot of stuff simply isn't complete. That's fine; it'll be fixed later on. However, that doesn't mean I don't have my issues with it, and I don't know how much of it will be fixed--but, overall, I had fun, and I'm sure you will too (so long as you accept that the game is in early access and will be for some time.)",1692832199,1692832199,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

One of the most surprising things I'd like to point out for old Xenonauts 1 players is a lot of the art seemlessly transitioned to 3D, to the point where it looks like the old 2D views. Lots of love and care was given to this game's grid and art system so I would very much like to congratulate the developers for their 3d modeling and design work.

Gameplay is everything you wanted from Xeno1 but better in 3D as the camera will jitter less, allowing you to have a more concise understanding of the map you're on. As for progression, already in this alpha stage the technology and advancements are quite interesting, minus a few missing research report entries being saved for future updates. Everything is extremely fun up to the current cutoff which in my experience seems to be around day 250~ and then it stalls out, presumably due to the mid-late game not being implemented yet.

All in all, I highly recommend buying this game on release, and buying in if you want to support the developers early on.",1692806229,1692806229,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Not much in the way of new features and the maps are pretty basic, at least in early game. I would describe the graphics as clean and functional and they are just about acceptable. What new features there are work very well and being able to destroy pretty much everything is great. I am past the refund point which is a good sign. Yes, I like it so far !

Update.
Been playing for 4 hours now and I cannot recommend this game. Even on normal difficulty it is insanely hard. My kill count is about the same as the aliens,which is not enough. Ineffective guns and grenades are making progress impossible. I have re-played my latest mission 4 times and no matter what tactics I use my soldiers are decimated after just 2 turns. Aliens are programmed to kill at vast ranges even when my troops have cover. Very disappointing and the content is lacking and therefore definitely not worth the money....

I'm looking forward to seeing how the developers add to and improve this game during early access.

In spite of all the negative reviews talking about how the game is too hard, if you're a fan of this genre you'll already know what you're in for. Sometimes your soldiers will die. 

However, in 32 hours I've already played through twice on normal difficulty. At a point the game notifies you that you've reached the end of the current content, then UFOs cease to appear and there is nothing more you can do. You can't even go and play any missions just for fun unless you start a new game. The amount of content at the moment is absolutely not worth £35. Not by a long shot.

Yes the price is a bit steep for an incomplete game, but you guys should already been expecting it when u hit the buy button. If you think the game is not worth the price then don't buy it now. Wait for the full release.

As for crashes, didn't encounter one yet during my 15hrs of game play. Yes, there are bugs of course. One of it would be cover is not really working and the aliens shoot more accurate then my guys. But that can be counter will smoke grenades. Just load your guys with smoke grenades and they'll be OK.

As for ground tactical combat, its not limited to kill everything. We now got assassinate or capture VIP missions. Item retrieval missions and maybe more different missions like XCOM2. 

Air combat, well....... that's not really my forte. I usually just auto resolve it, but there are more options to play around when compare to Xe1. (fleet formations)

Unlike Xe1, some item upgrades and base upgrades must now be built by engineers in order to be activated. No more freebies when the research is done. Which means one must really plan how to use the resources acquired from ufo crashes and missions.

I personally think Xe2 is OK. Yes its incomplete but the plot of the game is interesting and the game play is good.  
Xe2 is going to be great. I just hope the game devs would put their backs into it, make Xe2 worth the money we paid and not let early access players like us wait too long for it.",1692716948,1692716948,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is, however, still being hammered out, but to me it seems well worth the money.

I would only maybe want they draw out the pacing - well actually a lot. No need for a new xenoform for every single or every other mission. One of the things I didn't like about the new incarnations of XCOM was how terribly they handled pacing. I hope the makers of Xenonauts drag things a bit more out (not in the sense of things being easier - but allowing you to get a bit familiar with one set of aliens before you meet something new - don't throw a multitude of aliens at me and then end the game).

Another thing maybe that I'd like the trouble to actually have to research the biopsies, and alien tactics. I also want an alien container, and good cause to capture live aliens (and the danger that aliens contained in the base in an unupgraded alien containment facility may escape and cause an incident).

Some graphical customization would of course also be nice. Not asking for much - I have tossed thousands of hours at Rimworld. But not essential. 

Sound effects largely good. Game largely good. Very neat how the tactical maps' landscape and timing reflect where and when you are and what you are doing. Some more maps in due time?

1. I am spoiled, playing tonnes of mods and the like that give massive tech trees makes this one feel kinda basic.

The story is a redux of the original, not a continuation which is a real shame. It's basically the same game in terms of mechanics too. No notable increase in graphics or real changes in functionality. 

That said, I still had fun. At first. 

I ran a standard Ironman on Normal difficulty. It was tough, but enjoyably so. I made progress, and things got interesting with me taking out an alien base and having them attack mine (devastating!) in retaliation. Things were a little repetitive - same as the old version, but still cool.

Then two of my funding nations were displeased and left after a bad month, so I auto-lost. Game Over.

What? I figured I'd be able to continue with reduced funding, and things would get even tougher. I was looking forward to that! Perhaps even having a noble last stand! I don't mind losing like that.

But no. Instead it's an arbitrary loss with a stupid text screen. Apparently two nations leaving the project means the whole thing closes and the aliens win. Just made me feel like I wasted my time - I put 14 hours into that game. Had a good set up with multiple bases and some awesome soldiers. At least let me play with that until the bitter end!

In summary, it seems like a remake, but without any new content. If anything there's less - You can also no longer customise individual soldier portraits which is a shame. No mod support either. 

In its current state I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe give it a whirl once it's had some polish. If you never played the original, and if they drop the price!

2) Multiple saved games can be deleted quickly by using the select all box and unchecking the games you want to keep.

The only thing that frustrates me so far would be the panic system. No matter what you do with covering the map, there's no definitive way to control panic in the regions. I also find the game over condition of losing 2 regions to be a little strange, as if it's either not enough regions to make sense, and with the current panic system you're basically expected to watch a high panic region go through your fingertips, and yet you still have a functioning base where alien control is supposed to be dominant. 

Inventory and base management is OK. It can be a little bit of a headache when it comes to ferrying supplies to other bases as you slowly upgrade your systems to be more self-sufficient though. However, logistically speaking it makes perfect sense to me. Would be a little bit boring to have an all-in-one resource pool you can magically toss around. Although, with the existence of teleporters in the game, I would almost welcome the idea of a teleportation system for logistics as a later-game upgrade. Something to consider.

 I think it was a smart move to pull back the last 1/3 or so of the content so it can get more polish though. Will definitely continue to play now and then as the milestones are hit. If you're coming from the first game, I would personally recommend to wait for a while as the milestones progress. I personally picked it up a little early on to support the game and have not been displeased.",1692039263,1692039263,True,1,0,0.425801634788513184,0,True,False,True

Pros: good graphics, simplified combat/tactical maps (Downed space ships are not over crowded with in the way stuff), nice/more tactical goals (vip, hostage, recovery, Terrors. - need a few more IMO.) combat mechanics are the same just as before so that is great.

Cons: (to date) unfinished story line and tech tree ( early access it is), Air combat as reported it poor and unbalanced. early stage anger here - I get the aliens are better shots and the adv cleaners, but the normal human agents are sharp shooters and better skilled than your military guys.

The tactical battles are challenging but rewarding, and progressing through all the tech trees are really fun. I also really like the new 3D engine.

While there is a lot to love about this game there are still some rough patches, most notably the lack of completed story and the timed missions. I acknowledge that the timed missions are trying to encourage you to play the game in a different way, but the timer is so extreme that you pretty much have to save scum to have any real chance at completing them. I think the total turns should be increased in these missions, and also give an option to disable these types of missions before you start a campaign because not everyone will like them.

I think the framework of the game is really good but I think it would be best to refrain from buying the game until the endgame comes out.

As a passionate player, I've delved into various dimensions of the game, dissecting its gameplay mechanics, difficulty levels, bug occurrences, AI behavior, and, of course, my personal perspective. Throughout this review, I aim to strike a balance between admiration and constructive critique, presenting my own experiences and opinions. This in-depth analysis not only provides insights into my gaming preferences but also highlights my affinity for early access titles and my intricate understanding of the game's mechanics.

Appreciating Diverse Perspectives

Right from the outset, I was struck by the abundance of negative reviews circulating around the game. This initial observation compelled me to adopt a balanced viewpoint, recognizing that early access games are works in progress, open to improvement. I firmly believe that such titles deserve our understanding, given the evolving nature of game development.

My perspective is not one-dimensional; I empathize with the diverse viewpoints that players bring to the table. Engaging with different opinions and delving into thoughtful discussions is what keeps the gaming community vibrant and dynamic. After all, it's through such dialogues that we collectively contribute to the refinement of the gaming landscape.

Immersed in Tactical Strategy

Having a background in the XCOM series, I can't help but recall the traumas inflicted by timed missions in the past. This familiarity with tactical strategy gaming is what drew me to this particular title. My decision to tackle the game on the ""veteran"" difficulty level underscores my passion for challenging myself and immersing deeply in complex gameplay.

Dissecting Gameplay and Unearthing Gems

The game's mechanics truly impressed me, and I found myself engrossed in the gameplay for hours on end. However, one aspect that caught my attention was the implementation of timed missions—a topic that has sparked debates within the XCOM community. Upon closer examination, I discovered that the game primarily features timed missions related to rescuing civilians. While initially daunting, these missions become progressively manageable with strategic planning and adaptability, offering a satisfying sense of accomplishment.

What truly stands out is the developers' willingness to respond to player feedback. Their plan to introduce an option to disable timers reflects their commitment to enhancing the player experience. This responsiveness showcases their understanding of the gaming community's preferences and their dedication to refining the game.

Balancing Act: Gameplay and Difficulty

In my journey through the game, I've encountered a perceived imbalance in difficulty between ground and air combat. Ground combat often felt a bit too easy, while air combat presented a steeper challenge. This discovery fueled my anticipation for future updates and adjustments, as I recognized the developers' commitment to ongoing improvement. Such investment in the long-term development of the game reinforces my belief in its potential to evolve into an even more engaging experience.

Navigating Technical Waters

On the technical front, stability is paramount to a seamless gaming experience. In my case, a solitary crash occurred in nearly 50 hours of gameplay, suggesting a commendably stable environment. This stability not only ensures uninterrupted immersion but also indicates the developers' dedication to crafting a polished product.

Deciphering AI Behavior

As I traversed the game, the AI behavior caught my attention. Instances where civilians made rash decisions, rushing into danger, and aliens targeting seemingly illogical targets, showcased the intricacies of strategic AI mechanics. These moments of AI inadequacy stirred both frustration and anticipation within me—a desire for more intelligent, challenging opponents.

A Wholesome Conclusion

In wrapping up this review, it's important to emphasize that while I've addressed several critiques, my overall experience with the game remains positive. The fondness I hold for the game's strengths, coupled with constructive discussions about its shortcomings, defines my balanced perspective. As a gamer who values thoughtful analysis, constructive feedback, and the potential for growth, I eagerly look forward to the game's journey ahead.

Comprehensive Insights and Continued Exploration

Through this extensive review, I've endeavored to provide a comprehensive understanding of my gaming preferences, my gameplay experiences, and the lens through which I approach gaming. My measured critique, analytical exploration of mechanics, and genuine appreciation for developers' engagement underscore my passion for immersive gaming experiences. This review serves as an amalgamation of praise and critique, showcasing my optimistic outlook on the future evolution of this game.

Not because the story line isn't finished, but the combat needs tons of work.  Right now, there is very little rewarding about it and its mostly just a ton of frustration.    Enemies seem to be able to shoot through walls,   Your troops like to shoot at walls.  The accuracy math seems off.   50% chance to hit is more like 25% for me.   40% chance to hit wall seems to subtract from your hit chance, but it does not exactly tell you.   Your troops can't seem to shoot over a low wall unless they are right next to it.   They mostly just like shooting walls more then aliens.  They can barely shoot thru windows when they are next to them.  Glass stops bullets completely more often then not.  The devs seem  like they might be pretty sadistic, truth be told.     They should probably step back from trying to make a challenging game and start making a game that doesn't seem so unrealistic.  

Shotguns are underpowered - comically silly when you blast someone at point blank, hit 1 out of 3, and they kill you next turn.   Heavy guns and grenades are too nerfed with their time unit requirements.    Shields are made of angel food cake or maybe just paper mache, but they weigh like lead.    Pistols are so inaccurate, even at point blank range, that you would be better off throwing them instead of shooting them.   Snipers and riflemen are about the only troop types that seem to have any realism to them as long as they stop shooting walls long enough to kill an alien.     Except even they do not have any peripheral vision.  They can run through a room, and jack two computers, but miss the alien in the corner hiding behind a ...flower pot.  The user interface has a long way to go to reach x-com 2 status.    Your troops seem always debuffed on action points, but if you missed it, its difficult to know if they are mesmerized or were somehow suppressed by that alien at the other end of the map shooting  at their friend that wasn't even really that close.    The stun mechanics are pretty head scratching too.    I shot an alien pinned in a corner with 2 blasts at point blank with stun pistol and hit him twice with a stun baton and he still got another turn before the final swing knocked him out.   I think the stun gear was made by Nerf.

For a game that does not really seem to hide the lack of originality in concept, they are a bit innovative in areas.   The base stuff all seems like it will be pretty good.   The LOS/Fog of war is a big improvement over older games, but it needs a bit of work.   The soldiers sometimes feel like they have tunnel vision all the time.   The generic but clever system of multiple fire modes or levels of aiming is pretty close to great, but the triggers must all have 75lb pull weights or have out of focus optics based on the action point requirements of most weapons.   Maybe that is necessary for balance, but its fishy the person can run across the grocery store for the same cost as shooting a 'quick' shot with a machine gun.    That being said, I like the time units system, it just needs a bit of re-balancing.   

If you like turn-based or miss x-com.... and you hate yourself and really enjoy watching soldiers die, its probably fun.    I guess I'll recommend it for now, but really I am waiting for it to finish.    Hopefully they add a super easy mode or do a ton of balancing.     This game might need to be modable for me to actually enjoy it, but i'll give it another chance if/when they get it released.

What concerns me far more is the inability to load saves from previous versions of the game (I couldn't load any saves from the demo and I've heard from other players they can't load their old saves from the closed beta). If the game gets an update and I can't keep any of my old progress, what's the point of even playing now instead of waiting for the rest of the game to release? 

EDIT: sadly old saves cannot support new large-scale gameplay features. Old saves can still be played on a legacy branch, but it will essentially be early access forever, and you'd have to start fresh on the finished product. Unfortunate.

Despite all my caveats, this game is awesome. The whole ""planetary strategic defense"" element of the game is a superb feature. It's immersive, it feels incredibly meaningful and strategic, and it gives you a real sense of scale: you have relatively meager resources, and you need to protect a whole planet with them. 

Combat sounds are relatively unique and varied, enemy variety even at this early point is extensive. In particular, the art for the NPCs and items is very well done, unlocking and constructing new items/upgrades feels amazing. 

Yes, civilians are stupid. Cry about it. I think it's funny, and if you know how to position your soldiers intelligently, one or two civilians getting in the way won't ruin your plans. Just pretend they want to film the aliens for TikTok. I'm sure there are people out there stupid enough to run into combat with an alien civilization to get some internet clout. 

Please, Goldhawk, try to make sure players can complete the endgame within a single campaign save. I don't love this game enough to start from scratch when you finally finish your work.",1689688573,1691365459,True,4,1,0.532060980796813965,0,True,False,True

Soldiers:
Xcom: can have up to 6 soldiers of 4 basic classes with 1 researched class and one DLC class
Xenonauts: can have up to 12 soldiers (as long you have the transport for it) and their classes can be customised to suit your play style.

Air Combat/ planes:
Xcom: can have up to 4 planes per continent and can only send one to engage a UFO under a time limit
Xenonauts: can have as many planes as base space allows and can send up to 3 planes to engage a UFO under no time limit.

Base:
Xcom: a single base that requires excavation in order to provide space for more rooms
Xenonauts: can have multiple bases (6) and their rooms are all varied and useful.

Overall: it is a game worthy of being in the same league as XCOM even if the graphics are somewhat 1997 its better soldier capacity and new range of enemy aliens make it a treat for XCOM fans everywhere

Possible improvements: possibly the means to mark one of the soldiers in a mission as squad leader and this leaders provides bonuses to nearly solders like better accuracy and better bravery.

civilians: have civilians serve some purpose in game because right now they are serving as meat shields and some indicator of where the invaders are, give players a reason to save as many as they can. for example an armed soldier if saved could become another soldier in your base or saving civilians gives you cash rewards to name a few",1691112381,1691353029,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I played X1 extensively back in the day. The mods made it very fun. X2 is similar with better graphics, researches, aliens, tech and factions. I get how some people say it's too similar to the first one but I beg to differ. This does not feel too close to X1. In fact, considering everything that is missing due to X2 being in Beta, it is a solid game with little bugs. I look forward to seeing what is going to be released in the coming months!

No mods yet but it is on their 'Content Map'. I'm sure the community will add some great new concepts to an already great game! I'd give it a chance if you've enjoyed the X-Com series or the first Xenonauts and have some spare cash lying around.

While I can understand people don't like timed missions because xcom has given me and many other terrible trauma from how horrible they, I don't feel like it should be such a harsh criticism for this game because 1) there is only one mission type that it is applied to so far, that being the rescue mission for civilians who have been abducted. 2) Said mission was not very difficult any the times I was given it. The first time is the hardest because you lack the tools you get later on, I was playing on veteran on both the campaigns i've started and I have not played the first game and I haven't played the original xcoms that these two games are based off, and yet I was able to complete the timed missions relatively easily. 3) The developers have already stated that they will add the option to remove the timers.

The game and its difficulty does need more balancing. While I found the game very fun, I believe the ground combat to be a bit too easy, while the air combat is a bit too hard(I realize it isn't finished.) I believe that my issue with the air combat difficulty will be fixed when they add the next interceptor type or more upgrades for the Phantom, because once you reach near or at the end of what is currently in the game, the Phantoms find it much harder to compete with alien air superiority. Overall I find the air combat short and sweet, its shortness making it easier to swallow the fact that it does have much flavor yet. I think the MARS robots are too good and make it way too easy to bully the aliens into an early grave, the game is substantially hard without have the robots to push into the fog of war, and while shields exist, they can't keep up at all. Giving the shields a buff, while weakening(armor and health) and reducing the cost of building and rebuilding the MARS would help make the game feel like you have more options and not make the player overly reliant on the MARS.

When it comes to bugs, I have experienced very few. My game has crashed once in my almost 50 hours of playing. The only other thing I've noticed is sometimes my demolition won't go off when I try and throw it on cover that can be destroyed and it has happened to me multiple times.

The AI is very dumb sometimes, I've seen civilians run into fires and die. They will run towards aliens, and proceed to die. A civilian ended his turn blocking a doorway, so I shotgun blasted him in the face. I just wished they wouldn't get in the way and also not literally kill themselves for no reason. The Aliens always shoot the target closest to them and don't care if their lives are in imminent danger and would prefer to shoot the unarmed man rather than to person with an LMG that just blew their friend away.

Found firing on obstacles to clear them very buggy had to click it many times for it to work and the camera freaked out. Suppressing your own units is 100x easier than suppressing enemies. Suppression is too oppressive takes all current time units halves them next round and crouches you showing resistance to it may be nice.

The good:
*Tactical combat feels very much like you'd expect from an ""X-com"" style game.  It's here that the game shines currently.

*The story, or at least what has been released/implemented, is pretty compelling, and seems well thought out.   It's obviously not some classic RPG level, but does a good enough job of immersing you in a believable world.

*Tutorial is pretty good for this genre of game, even if a little more on rails than I personally would like.

*Less a reflection of the game itself, but the developers  seem to be way more engaged with the community  (answering steam forum posts, and soliciting feedback) than most devs.  Didn't see any heavy handed silencing of critical posts either, so another plus.  This alone helped my decision to buy before the game was actually finished.


The Bad
*The pacing of the campaign itself currently feels  off, and the campaign is not currently finished.  Where you might expect a slow burn up to mid game, that classic x-com grind from woefully behind the aliens, to catching up, to dominating them.  It instead was a jarring race from classic x-com start,  to some sort of equal ground, to what felt like a 'timer' on finishing the end game before auto losing.  I assume this is being tuned still, but they might just as easily go for 'short bite sized x-com' rapid  progression, as they are to idle back and make it closer to long war.

*Air combat looks and feels like it could be much more than it is, but seems like it falls short.   There's an auto resolve that is mostly not a trap (there were a few UFO types that required very meticulous manual air combat to not lose), but it's definitely one of the weaker places.

*AI  for both alien and civilian are currently a little frustrating.  Civilians, even the unarmed ones, will run wildly into aliens, sometimes right next to them (This is extremely BS behavior for anyone who knows what  one of the alien types is, in any of these x-com style games).  While the aliens will sometimes pick a corner and just hide there for the  entirety of the round.

*Diversity  of maps leaves a little to be desired, but I believe the developer has indicated that may improve?

this is my biggest issue with them they lower the terror level even thought you abandon the friendly's to be mass murdered by cleaners ? ""it makes no logical sense.""  you are litterly abandoning people to be mass murdered.

what should happen is you have x amount of time to go in and save as many people and data computers as possible then the enemy forces start to show up and you have ability to ether flee or fight or both, if you save x number of people by leave then terror level should go down by that amount if you save no one then it should go up, if you save the base and people then terror level should go down max amount.

also it is fine to have timer mission where the aliens or cleaners show up at  X time period but maybe make it random time period also, if they are suppose to arrive maybe make it so I do not have to fight 20 of them at start of mission.

Friendly units you go up to should follow you back or head back to your craft to be saved like in original x-com game u should get a bounce to reducing the terror level based on how many people you save and bounce to how much monies you make at end of month based on how many people you save from each mission.

it seems weird that this is a go in and collect things before aliens get here when the aliens are already here. ?

I think adding expansion to the game that adds terror form deep tech and missions to Xenonauts 2 and also fixing friendly unit issue in tactical battles along with re-balance or changing the cleaner missions would help this game feel better in a logical sense and over all improve experience of the game.

I would also love ability to setup starting base how ever you want at start of game I mean layout.


I add the links of the original two games that this game is based off of along with link to original Xenonauts

The problem is that it is VERY barebones in its current state. There is a massive amount of content missing from the game and you can't even technically finish the game. You just abruptly get hit with a ""You have finished playing through all the content! Please wait while we extend the campaign playability."" The game is basically unbeatable in its current form which is just ridiculous. Large chunks of research text and lore don't exist at all and are just filled in with placeholders. I was expecting an almost finished product, not what basically appears to be a beta. 

As for the gameplay itself, it functions almost identical to the orignial Xenonauts albeit with some very nice UI changes. I greatly enjoy the rotatable camera and I do really like the design of the game. Your troop loadouts are very customizable and there are a lot of cool additions you can apply on your soldiers. You can trade accuracy for more armor or weight, etc. It's a neat touch that I greatly enjoyed. The addition of the ""cleaners"" is something that I found very cool and I wish these kinds of games would implement human enemies more often. It makes it very interesting from both a lore and gameplay perspective. The other aliens that were added into the game are lame and I didn't really care about them at all to be honest. I also found the game very easy, especially in compared to the first one and the XCOM games. The MARS tanks make a large amount of missions trivial when you can just blow up the entire map to find the aliens, or just wait them out. The only challenge I really faced was in the Cleaner Cell missions since they were timed and there is an insane amount of enemies on that mission. Losses basically don't matter when I can just hire a highly accurate sniper to replace somebodyI lost. I was never in any danger at all during the entire campaign, and I played on Commander difficulty or whatever the one below the highest one is. When I first started my campaign, I was very excited to see a variety of mission types but this quickly falls off as the game progresses since the game is badly unfinished. There is so much missing content that it's impossible to ignore. The entire ship combat has basically been ported over from Xenonauts 1 and literally has warnings telling you it isn't done. I'm not a fan of this ""early access"" marketing thing, as I find it makes game launches lazy. 

Since this game is basically an enhanced reskin of the original Xenonauts and is glaringly unfinished, I cannot recommend this game at its current price. It is not worth $40 and there are better games to play instead. It's a massive shame since I was really looking forward to this game, but it has been released too early, and thus deserves a negative review.

On that note, maybe adding dedicated first, last and nickname bars so that there isn't much of a character limit to contend with when naming the soldiers). I love the accuracy stuff majority of the time because it feels like there's a chance for both sides to really miss their shots, but I feel like the aliens either laser you without any degree of accuracy debuffs or they have a fair fight with you, and its usually the former.

the game is incomplete hence early access, there is no end game and goes only to day 300 or so, so bear that in mind. However theres plenty of content as it is + new enemies + new mechanics in play, i love that the aliens have the cleaners, id love to see more things like it, maybe even have to assassinate or abduct host nation politicians to keep funding etc cause the aliens have been at them. would be cool.

Anyway in terms of gameplay improvements, they are certainly improved, overwatch happens alot more now so Reapers are alot less ridiculous (yes it means the aliens overwatch alot now too). Smoke and stun grenades are worth it now and highly effective, they are good for shutting enemies down and really make the gameplay more tactical. Also the addition of melee weapons is awesome, more should be added, looking forward to the 40k mod that adds in chainswords!

Anyway the game is solid and a big improvement, more dynamics etc. the main noticeable loss in this game however is the lack of vehicles, they are basically gone now, replaced by tracked drones, i think this should be fixed as having a tank is pretty nice.

Ok sooo the game looks better then the first ( at least combat section - the rest is Xenonauts 1 ), unfortunately thats where the good news ends.

 So its bare bones out there even for a EA but lets see what can be said - the combat is skewed in favor of the aliens, and not in the good way ( getting shot from the other side of the map with 100% accuracy every time is not fun , or the mesmerized trait which takes all of your AUs - add the bug that the aliens can shoot through walls and its not a very fun experience ). 

Your soliders resemble more a bunch of amateurs then selected specialists form different countries - 3 of my squad misses with a 98% probability - and on this point this is the type of game that rewards tactics and patience but then it throws those time missions which force you to rush the taget ( first find it then kill/capture it ) but theres no way you wont lose soldiers . ( they said in the last update they will address this to allow for timer customization ). There is no damage implemented for crash UFOs as of now  - they look pristine after a crash - also you can't breach so stack in front of the door and go.Somehow the UFOs interiors feel small. There is a bug which shows the dead bodies inside the ufo at the start of combat so you know where it is even if the map is under fog of war. 

Loading times for missions are huge but  even transitioning between parts of your base ( workshop / lab / hangar / armory etc ) its done with a lag.

Aircombat well it sucks but we knew about that as the devs said they havent sort it out.

Content there isnt much you can research up to tier 3 weapons and armor / tier 2 interceptors and a couple of other things which relate to the main story. But overall theres to much missing to get any feeling of immersion.
Also some maps are recycled form X1 just 3d - but even the layout of the aliens in those maps is the same ( i m looking at the city maps here - if you played X1 is the same you get 2 aliens in the gas station two more on the "" left side"" of your dropship, two more in the house after the gas station and 1 and 1 in each supermarket).

To sum it up it has the potential to be a great game but at this stage and for the $$ value if you are not a fan of the franchise i would say wait - how long its hard to say the game has been in development for so long so its a bit of a let down that the EA has so little to offer.  

Edit : if you continue to play after the ""end of the game"" you keep getting reports that are empty ""placeholder here'' even if you dont have anything to research also from day 300 ufos stop spawning. One thing that is also strange is how the panic grows in the regions, for example : NA had a panic of 44 tho i had a base there and it saw the least alien activity while Asia which saw the most activity was at 19 ( this is with a game of 300 days )> Also the counter to the end of game progress keeps ticking up it about 68% now tho i finished the EA access at about 10 % - will let it run to see what happens when it reaches 100%.",1690786794,1690793673,False,4,0,0.510402321815490723,0,True,False,True

I went on my first Terrorism mission and as players of the original X-Com will remember, in one combination, you'd usually run into Chrysalids and Saucers, plus the Zombies created by the Chrysalids. In this you have the Zombie creators also, plus Gun Drones and also a new one, Wraiths, which I assume give a To Hit penalty and/or evade your vision at closer range than most aliens.

First we see 4 citizens and 4 Zombie creators, who kill a couple of the citizens, who rise up as Zombies The Zombies beat two of my armored people to death in one blow. I was thinking the mission was pretty much done already. But I kept on with it. While I tried to concentrate on getting rid of the Zombie creators and the new ones hatched from the Zombies, three of Wraiths attack. Basically, all I could do was hold a perimeter and try and keep the aliens back. Then the one Gunship I spotted disappears, so I send my one remaining Assault person to guard the back corner of the building that was on our right flank, don't want one of those coming up behind. We finally beat off the attacks and I had 6 troopers left. I finally look around the back corner and sure enough, the Gun Drone is there and as I charge up for the Assault, spot another Gun Drone close up and Wraith way off. I figured we were dead, we muddle through, lose one person, taking out the remaining aliens. Then there's another Gun Drone and as I chase that down, two more Wraiths. Lose one more person (revived luckily), but every time I thought the end was drawing near, there was more, twice.

In the end I think there were only 15 aliens, which was normal for a Terrorist-type mission Maybe it was just in my head that it became a slog because I had expectations that after hardship there would be relief, but there was only more hardship. Lost 4 troopers out of 9, but I guess that's pretty good considering we lost 2 very early on. Make sure to build that Medical room, you may recover some of those you thought dead.

It is still Early Access, we interrogated a Sebillian and they still didn't have the text ready for the end of that Research. If you are expecting a finished product, this is not it. I'm sure some more balancing is also in the cards. Probably best played taking an IRL rest break after a mission like that.",1690748963,1690748963,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

At the moment the game is very unfinished, and it shows in a variety of ways, but does have enough differences from the last Xenonauts to warrant a purchase of about 25$ at the very most. There is new music, new graphics, new sounds, new effects. This is pretty much all I wanted to improve in Xenonauts anyways, but since this is a full sequel, I expect more. Devs have already stated they're aware of many issues, and in the game its stated with some popups that certain things will be added in the future, but I do think they should reprioritize mod support to be number 1 priority, this way the community can saturate itself and keep itself sated for a time, giving devs an opportunity to gauge what the community wants and is willing to create to add to the game, a form of feedback that can be priceless for a game still in development. The negatives of the game begin to popup pretty overwhelmingly in the form of the bad pacing the game has currently. I was playing on the second to easiest difficulty, so there was to be some casualties and setbacks of course with any title like this, but the difficulty spiked unexpectedly and there seemed to be no way to keep up with the aliens after a certain point, mainly due to a lack of funds and the aliens seemed like they weren't meant to arrive at that stage of the game. Xenonauts and the XCOM titles that inspired it had a much slower burn compared to this, and pacing seemed like a steady march with some trials by fire that would determine the fate of runs, but this seems to start out with the same impression before catching you offguard and getting you with enemies that seem out of place relative to the players progress. Itd be interesting if this were a different take with the new game, where the aliens will randomly have stronger or weaker craft appear and you are meant to pick your battles more, but the funding dropped rapidly and the UFO's encountered began to be just more powerful ones, not a mix of weaker and more powerful UFO's

The rest of this review may contain specifics and spoilers.

The psyons and sectons both seem too capable, I agree with other reviews that it is insane that aliens can move, shoot, move, shoot. While this does make gameplay much more nail-biting, it also means that the aliens increase in power exponentially if you encounter more than one, and soldiers linearly. This would have been fine if I were on a harder difficulty, that would be the point, but again, I was on one of the easiest difficulties, so when one alien was capable of emerging from cover, killing two seperate soldiers, then ducking back into cover, I was upset with how powerful they were compared to the early stage of the game I was in, just getting laser weapons, and hadn't even finished researching the first researchable armour. The beginning of the game is well paced and seems fair, you lose some guys but can win, but the difficulty spike of suddenly encountering wraiths while still only on lasers and just starting to build some basic armour, was pretty nutty. Also, the research for the robots that fly around and shoot and heal suggested they are meant to be weak in combat, but they were just as accurate as the other aliens while using an automatic weapon that burst with about 10 shots, which is entirely unreasonable, and they especially shouldn't be capable of overwatching twice with 10 round bursts. There was also a minor glitch with the giant explodable steel drums that exploded but the model didn't change, but you could also walk straight through them. Also, a base attack occurred right before I began writing this review with far too many chryssalid style aliens and far too many new aliens I hadn't seen before which rapidly wiped my feeble base that I couldn't get more soldiers for due to running out of money buying other facilites, such as a second base to try and limit the crazy number of alien events popping up on the radar screen. The game is difficult and has content, but it needs improvement. 
-prioritize mod support first
-rework pacing, reduce difficulty spikes and rework where and when late-game aliens appear
-cleaners need to be much weaker than the aliens, not equal if not more powerful than some 
-remove the stun effect from smoke grenades. Right now they can stun entities. I stunned one of my own soldiers when throwing a smoke down, moving him into position in the smoke, then waiting 1 turn. 
-if you want a stun effect grenade, make a stun grenade, if you want smoke to affect entities, reduce the effect it has to just 1 stun per turn in smoke or movement into a tile of smoke, so that a 45 health unit doesnt get stunned in 1 turn by a smoke grenade meant to conceal, not stun
-reduce early game alien accuracy, or reduce other attributes such as time units so they are more reasonable compared to player progress. You can add more alien types, or alien ranks to existing aliens and just change some colours on their sprites, allowing a much bigger tier set for each type of alien, allowing for more aliens to appear early game but balanced by low rank, and their rank scales to later game where they appear with the same health or abilities, but different weapons, tactics, armour, piloting something
-provide some more options to generate revenue for early game runs besides selling much-needed materials. Take an XCOM: UFO DEFENSE route perhaps, and allow players to manufacture items with their workshops to then sell for profits, which creates a chess game where they have to decide if they need to build equipment to use or use the workshop to make revenue, but cant do both due to the new worker system of Xenonauts 2
-keep adding new music, the old Xenonauts had the issue of one track looping for each different screen type, it'd be nice to hear more amazing new music, or maybe even include some tracks from the old game in the new one, while also providing new tracks

EDIT: UPDATED REVIEW, +20 HOURS, FINISHED GAME

Now having completed the game, applying what I learned before and dropping the difficulty to easiest, there are a number of new things that I can properly give feedback on:
-PLEASE CHANGE THE JETPACK SOUND IT IS AWFUL
-the new exosuit is far better and enjoyable to the old power armour from Xenonauts, and even leaves some room potentially for just one more armour after it even more powerful, or with variations on the concept of power armour, maybe a mega melee suit with crazy armour for crushing aliens, or a variant that can only use a kind of super weapon, like a long rifle or a mega beam that pierces everything in front of it, with a high time unit cost or more expensive movement
-Jetpacks being revamped is so much nicer than having to opt for a weaker armour with jetpack capabilities. Instead, players can choose to take a weight penalty for the benefit of more mobility, with the simple click of a button for any armour
-Base attacks seem to just start happening randomly without any good reason or explanation, and because of this mainly, it forces the player to have to rush the correct line of technology, armour and weapons, in that order, and relegate all other research well below to keep up with the rapid pace of the alien invasion overall. If it weren't for the worry of a sudden random base attack without a known cause, then players could be able to research plot and other technologies rather than specifically armour and weapons, in that order. While someone may argue that one can avoid this with missile defenses, it is financially not a possibility to do that
-The weird U001 object appearing and being unfinished was ominous, and gave an eerie feeling that added to the atmosphere since I didn't know what it was, and it was blank but had a pic
-Laser shotgun sounds AWESOME
-More alien diversity needed
-its not obvious what can and cant be sold off for needed funds, so idk if I missed plasma weapons or other research by selling corpses, etc",1690478758,1690698649,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The combat and strategy really get my imagination running and there is just a great sense of theme that runs through the whole system. Lots of people say the game is too hard or that the timed missions are to hate. But I do think the timed missions have made some of my most interesting games and the difficulty is mitigated (at least on normal) by lots of game rules you just have to learn yourself. As an example, knowing that standing right behind one bit of cover does almost nothing, but crouching behind cover with several things in the way is very effective. As well as realizing shields are kings of baiting out what seemed like BS snap shots in CQC situations. All of this comes together in a more grounded turn based strategy game that I love.

Not sure if i can recommend the game to players unfamiliar with the 1993 game , its pretty brutal and there's no real hand holding , you're fighting a technologically superior enemy and have to play serious catch up in the beginning and if you make the right decisions you can almost hit a point where you are equal in tech(until the next level of progression).

Game is still under construction and is not finished, I've played to the point where the game tells me ""that's all for now"", and it was quite the enjoyable mixture of fun and nostalgia.

However they decided to keep the worst elements of those games and then tack on a few of their own, while offering SOME QOL improvements over xenonauts 1 they added several things that make the game miserable and counter intuitive.
For instance, when using any throwable equipment the hit chance is not the chance to throw exactly where you click or somewhere in the area. Its the odds that your high speed low drag spec ops trooper doesn't flub the grenade at his feet or spin 180 degrees and throw it at his friend. Same applies for grenade launchers and the like.
Anyone who plays turn based games prays to RNGesus but I've never seen RNG take the form of a dice roll to see if your soldier is clinically retarded every time you ask them to do something.
Missions have no deploymet phase so if you start a mission with an alien staring into the back of your chopper you had best hope you kill it on the first shot or its going to look like Omaha beach on turn 1 when 1/2 your squad gets wiped out.

This is a tactics game, the players failures should be due to poor tactics (including hoping for good luck) but Xenonauts 2 the player loses because the game doesn't offer any possible solution, just your squads getting massacred on turn 1 because I guess chinook pilots like to land 10 feet away from hostiles. Special shoutout to the cleaner base raid where you start the mission in full view of 4 Uzi wielding enemies. Hope you knew in advance and brought 3 shield troopers at the back of the chopper.

That said, I like it. I always thought Xenonauts was too basic and old-fashioned to be interesting, but now that XCOM2 and PP and JA3 have jumped the shark, I don't think there are any modern or innovative tactical games to hope for and a conservative throwback like Xenonauts 2 is the best we can get. It's simple, straightforward, clean and grounded. It's nothing you haven't seen before, but it is decidedly more up-to-date than, say, Jagged Alliance 2.1.13 or X-Piratez - visually easier to read, with better UX and other modern conveniences.

There is nothing I can say about the game that you don't, in all likelihood, already know. XN2 sticks to the X-Com formula. It's a cut from the old block, polished up to modern usability standards.

I enjoy original Xenonauts and UFO Defense, but they are not the pinnacle of tactics. If you have not played Xenonauts or UFO Defense and are wondering what kind of tactical action there is, it's a game of hide and seek but the seeker is the one who loses. This is not Jagged Alliance with aliens. Even UFO Aftershock had better tactics. Maintaining corridors, overwatch, and using cover are good ways to get your soldiers killed.

You can't lean around walls, you must stand in the open, while only facing the direction you walk. Instead you send your dudes out to get eyes on the enemy, they do so, next you hide completely. Shooting means the enemy will immediately return fire with a weapon that does twice as much damage by a shooter with better aim than your best marksman. Now fall back, your soldiers have memorized the enemies position, throw grenades over the walls. If walls are blocking your way, then throw ""demo charges"", a device that only harms reinforced walls and roughly scolds soft flesh, Xenonauts 2 has a setting where the construction industry made insane technological advances.

Arm everyone with machine guns or shotguns, by gamifying the weapons this has spoiled the qualities that make each useful. More bullets means you get more chances to hit and the difference in weight isn't that severe. Also why can't I have an SMG? The bad humies get them, you can even swipe one off a body and use it. Speaking of bad weapon design, don't use stun weapons, they put you in danger. Instead just throw smoke grenades, at best you knock out the enemy and at worst you reinforce the reason for everyone to carry machine guns.

Spamming shots is the best way to deal with anything, cover doesn't provide protection, but instead reduces chance to hit. This may sound like the same thing, but cover means you regard the different size and hardness of the feature you're using as protection. Xenonauts 2 instead slaps a low percentage on the dice roll as a penalty, the equivalent of sticking a bonus to the bad guys armor class in 5E. Much deep, such tactical combat. Also, still can't lean around a wall, you must stand in the open to shoot around a corner, rather dramatic if you ask me.

If you have read all this and think it's just someone bitching about the game being hard, well kinda, but not hard in a good way. UFO Defense was hard, Xenonauts too, but it feels like someone dialed up the suck knob and didn't think that was a problem. This game hinges itself on being unfair and nothing else. My proof? Just watch the AI, they are dumb. Non-psionic aliens wil run in small circles if you leave their sight, you can reliably get the enemy to shoot civilians rather than your armed soldiers, the enemy frequently wanders into open terrain, areas with a hazard seem to have no bearing with pathfinding.

I watched a civie walk into a fire, I decided it was a form of protest directed to our war with the aliens. This was during a mission where I had seven turns to rescue at least five people from ""tubes"". We didn't actually care about the civilians, it's more of a political keep away game. I found this out because almost all of my rescues were vaporized and it had no effect on the objective, not on purpose this time. Though it did make me realize there's no point to putting empathy into any civilian casualty, you have no control over that. You just need to touch alien tubes to win anyways. In seven turns, it sometimes takes me seven turns just to leave the chopper. Most of my dudes would have had to run flat out for five turns to get to some tubes, leaving only two turns to deal with aliens shooting at me. The mission also just ends after the time runs out, so really it's a timer to rack up kills since the objective is fubar.

How fast and loose am I supposed to play? I understand some people take a tactic of at least half a guy coming home is victory. This game doesn't have Firaxcoms standards of success, but what the hell? The game has been engineered to handicap players, it's like I'm playing wheelchair basketball and the enemy is doing doughnuts on the court with trucks. I recently played the first Xenonauts in prep for this game and I had fun, but something is off with Xenonauts 2. If you're the kind of Xcom fan who wants to suffer playing the game, this is for you. Enjoy, you frighten me.

Xenonauts 2 is a solid game by itself. Like its predecessor and the classic XCOM – UFO defence. I do recommend it.
I like that the battlescape graphics are in 3D and you can rotate your view 360 degrees.
My advice about the timed mission – Don’t stress. Forget about killing the VIP target in 7 turns, just steal the computer data and evac. You will discover the hidden base and infiltrate that instead to defeat the Cleaners.

After the initial wave, UFO encounters will resume. Utilize this intervening time and to conduct research, as well as to construct equipment and bases.

In my gameplay so far, I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs or glitches.

But most importantly, WHAT IS HERE IS FUN. It's a good good game. It just needs a little polishing and then it needs features and an endgame, pronto. 

Some things that definitely need work:
 - Many MANY more options for difficulty customization. I want to be able to specifically tweak: My income, the rate of panic, the quantity of enemies spawned in levels, the number of ufos, the health/armor of enemies/ufos, the overall cost of things, the rate at which the timeline progresses, etc.
 - Needs more maps (which, granted, is planned) because the monotony of map types makes raiding your 50th ufo very tiresome and not at all exciting anymore. Maybe that's intentional. That it feels routine. But I'd at least like to be like: ""Wow, this really is a forest in the middle of nowhere"" or ""Holy shit, my soldiers are fighting on a fuckin' glacier""
 - There needs to be something explicitly said somewhere in the game that YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST PRIORITIZE AIR SUPERIORITY. Either that, or don't punish people who invest heavily into the ground game.

Only then did I realize their inspiration were the old X-Com games, which I never played. I disliked the style of the new X-Com titles, but the grim and old-school style of Xenonauts 1 was exactly my thing and I loved the game, although I wasn't very good at it.

I was very happy to hear that Xenonauts 2 is now on Early Access and immediately bought it, despite its unfinished state. I regret nothing. it's a great strategic game. in short: The game is unforgiving, but mostly fair, grim, tactical, mostly realistic and has a wonderful atmosphere. It might feel repetitive at times and some people dislike that there are mission types now that have a time limit to kill a VIP or extract survivors (but unlimited reinforcements will spawn after 8 turns), but I personally found them interesting and not too hard to do. Doing the same kind of missions and map types over and over again doesn't get old, because there is always something new in it or some danger involved. if the game feels to hard for you, play it on easy and reload a lot, like I do, and it will still  be fun to play, mostly. The only thing I really dislike apart from some small mechanics I will mention below is how many irreversible long-term mistakes you can make, if you focus on the wrong science, or similar, because you just didn't know what would happen later on in the game, which sometimes soft-locks you and forces you to start the campaign again.
 
Xenonauts 2 seems to be just as good as the first game with a much improved engine. It's strange how it looks a lot better but still somehow the same. At first I was a bit disappointed that the free view was actually just a snapped 45 degree turn with a transition animation, but you cannot really view the battlefield from all angles, as I had hoped. However, I quickly got used to it and it's not recognizable most of the time.

The game difficulty, again, is brutal, even on easy settings, if you are on your first playthrough. It is mostly fair, bot some things just bother me.

My points of criticism so far:

The game is split into two mechanics, a global map view with your aircraft and bases and the actual turn based combat missions. Both require a lot of knowledge about game mechanics the tutorial and the tooltips just don't give. In your first playthrough you will have many ""Well, If I had only known that earlier.."" moments that you might find make the game experience interesting or frustrating. The game mostly explains the basic mechanics and how things work, but gives you no help at all in long term planning so that you might find yourself under-equipped and low tech in late game because you put your focus on radar coverage and air superiority or, on the opposite, you might have the best equipped soliders, but you just never manage to deploy them or shoot down the superior UFOs or even detect them because you lack aircraft and radar coverage.

Same goes for the battlefield strategies: Often it will take many dead soldiers until you really understand what you absolutely shouldn't do. I tend to save and reload a lot to be able to learn from my mistakes, but if you like to play through a mission in one go without loading saves, be prepared to have half of your soldiers die because you just did not know a certain mechanic, yet.

The combat feels fun and super realistic and threfore also very punishing. I would say, 80% of the combat feels tough but fair, but there are these 20% that really make you get mad at the game for not telling you this or making such dumb decisions. Let me give a few example of combat mechanics I really dislike so far,

- Shooting around corners isn't a feature (yet?), so your soldier will either have 100% cover and no line of sight or 100% line of sight, but no cover depending on the angle of the shot. You cannot shoot around that corner without fully exposing yourself.

- Additionally, the game features so-called ""overwatch fire"" which means that the enemy can fire even within the players turn, if the player enters the line of sight of a prepared enemy. This means that if an enemy approaches my soldier, who is hiding behind a corner, I will have to step out of the corner in my own turn to shoot at him, but since that will put me in the line of sight of the enemy, he will  be able to shoot first and possibly even kill my soldier, even though I was in a defensive position.

- Often the aliens will not only have superior weapons but also superior accuracy. So you will hardly be able to hit them behind cover, but they will sometimes shoot from a long distance at your soldier behind cover and one-hit them. I found myself reloading very often because I just couldn't accept that a perfectly defended position, even sometimes covered in smoke, was not enough to protect my soldiers from breaching aliens who just entered and killed everyone with one shot, but were missed by my own overwatch-fire.

- Some enemy types just have too many advantages at once. One enemy type has cloaking, high mobility, high range, high accuracy, some armor, high HP and high damage, not to mention a plasma grenade that just one-hit-kills everyone in a 4x4 area and can be thrown over the same distance as an assault rifle can be shot effectively. And then there can sometimes be 5 or 6 of them at once accompanied by battle-turrets. Even with easy setting and reloads I find that incredibly hard to tackle. But then again, I'm not a very skilled player.

- The amount of times an enemy triggered overwatch fire of my soldiers but they missed their impossible 
shot and hit one of my own soldiers instead cannot be counted anymore. I would love to be able to decide, if overwatch fire will be triggered or not.

- The cover system needs some polishing. Crouching behind cover should make a difference as opposed to standing behind cover, but the game will  just take the higher of the two reduced hit-chance values and ignore the other. On the other hand, shooting over three objects directly in front of your soldiers should not decrease hit chances, as they don't block the line of sight to the target that is far away. The game needs some way to calculate hit chances more realistically. 

Also the research system isn't great yet. There are just too many options for a beginner to make decisions. You will find that ballistic weapons are absolutely fine for 10 missions, until all of a sudden, without any hint, they are just way underpowered and you wish you had invested in other weapon type research, but now it's too late. Especially because the plot often wants you to research plot-critical items instead - time that you cannot put into researching good equipment. In short: The game should inform us more about what kind of thing we risk neglecting or at least tell us what might happen if we don't focus on a certain aspect. 

All in all, this game is just awesome and i love it. its technical state at the moment (End of July 23) is pretty good, although the end-game is missing, air combat isn't polished yet and some codex entries (which are generally very interesting to read!) are missing, too. I rarely had any crashes, just the loading times a re a little slow. 

Be aware that save games might be unreadable after a patch forcing you to restart the campaign. Sometimes you can get around it by copying the old saves into a different folder (xenonauts-edit), but at some point, this might kill your progress.

8/10 - my personal GOTY so far, even in the current state. I hope the devs will fix all the problems and make this a perfect 10/10, because it definitely could be.",1690369424,1690369424,True,17,0,0.647015571594238281,0,True,False,True

When it comes to the ""timed"" missions I have only found one issue which is the abduction site where it hard ends after 5 or so turns. When it comes to the cleaner hubs, I think the reinforcements showing up after a certain amount of turns are a good feature that is currently ok but not bad- just needs to be worked out a bit more to make it better as it isn't perfect. When you consider the cleaners in lore it makes sense they would have reinforcements ready to pour into an area especially a local command center that if taken would decapitate them in such a region. It is also apart of the aspect where in the first game and this one there is no level playing field, at least early on- your faction is always in an uphill battle against the invaders. And even then, the time limit on the cleaner hubs as well as the abduction sites aren't an issue for any competent player and the time limits are ONLY on those missions. Every other mission such as crash sites and base attacks and etc do not have a time limit.

As for this game being a Xenonauts 1 ""copy"", it is not. This game is a sequel and with what is available currently clearly shows such. It is an improvement to the first game already, and also still has its fair share of unique aspects. I can say this confidently as after beating what was currently available I went back and have been replaying the first game. The quality of life difference between the two is already enough to make me consider this a good sequel, but the new additional changes are also plenty to call the game a sequel. For those who wanted a different scenario- just go play the other XCOM games, the devs keeping to the premise of X1 in my opinion is a good thing as its a unique aspect and stands different from all the other X games out there with its own sort of charm to it. I see some also complain about the lack of content compared to the first game and the presence of placeholder text, which all I can say is you bought an early access game congratulations! It won't be a completely finished product! And for the fact it is a good early access and isn't riddled with poor performance and game breaking bugs is a good thing and shows to me that Goldhawk care for this game and aren't just churning out a product for money like we've seen with many early access AAA ""games"".

For what it is currently, its good. Not perfect, but good- a lot of the complaints about time restrained missions and it being a ""Xenonauts 1 clone"" seem to mostly be people who can't handle a change in difficulty or people who were expecting a completely different game.

Now with that out of the way, here comes the obligatory part of the review where I rant about the gameplay mechanics like I know what I'm talking about.

Guns damage spread feels way too high. I think it's a +/-50% damage range. To put this into perspective, a cannon round from the MARs can do anywhere from 35-105 damage. That's waaaay too big a spread. It should be more like 25%. More than that, it's just frustrating. It makes counting HP almost pointless since your shot can range from failing to kill even a secton, to one shotting almost any enemy in the game. Vice versa too, armor feels worthless when the random damage spread is so high. 

Might just be me though, I'm sure a workshop mod will be able to fix this if the devs intend for RNG to be this extreme. X1 didn't feel this bad with damage, but maybe it's just because I can see the hp of enemies in X2, making me feel REALLY cheated when a shot does so little damage lol.

Personal gripe, but I do wish you could take multiple robots into battle with you. They cost 250k each (same price as 25 soldiers) and aren't as versatile. The biggest advantage they have is their fixed stats, which 250k is a HEAVY price to pay for. If you can afford it, I say you should be able to do it. God darn aliens can have like 6 servitors of death per battle, gimme more allies on a mission that can ignore their stupid suppression.

Only other complaint about balance is if allies can bleed, enemies should bleed too. Idk what the % for bleed is, but god sometimes it's really bad, and makes me jealous that even those damn cleaners (human enemies) don't seem to have blood.

You have 9 dudes, instead of 4-6 in Xcom. But that also means that the enemies are individually much stronger compared than your troops.
Your enemies not only hit harder and shoot more accurately than your dudes. They also seem to have perfect information on you, as they are often able to shoot your people from the dark either in their turn or as over-watch. So you will be constantly forced to reload save files as your troops got one-shot from nowhere.
Meanwhile, your troops struggle to take down enemies, most due to their inferior range and accuracy. I guess players are supposed to move their troops closer to have a decent shot, but that might just trigger more enemies unexpectedly, which often result in the death of the troop...
To make things much worse, many missions have very tight timers (like 6-7 turns), which is barely enough for you to locate and access mission objectives even without the presence of enemies. It feels almost inevitable to suffer multiple casualties each mission as you rush your fragile troops into superior and vigilant enemies, unless you save-scum a lot...

It is an upgrade in many ways, although many things remain unfinished, and the modding community does not exist as of the time of writing. The pros and cons are mostly the same as X1, so I will skip to some highlights of how it differs from X1. 
[h1] Improvements: [/h1]
1. Better graphics. This is not an AAA project, but being able to freely rotate your camera and view the battlefield in 3D is great. The 2D portraits are also more modern compared to X1. 
2. More varied mission types. Finally not all missions are like ""kill all aliens and you win"". I understand the frustration of timed missions, but I actually think that they are a good design because it encourages aggressive plays while most scenarios encourage slow gameplay. However, as many have pointed out, it is currently unbalanced. Yet, with balancing changes and, as declared already, an option to modify or remove the timer, I do think that having this feature adds to the game more than it takes. 
3. Research tree. The research tree feels more interesting now. [spoiler]New generation of weapons, fighters, and armors aren't strict upgrades from the last. They offer new mechanics, many new advantages, and often some drawbacks. The option of having modules is also an interesting addition, although this system is currently quite rudimentary and can be expanded significantly. [/spoiler]
4. Base building. The base building is slightly changed, making it more modular and interesting, given the adjacency bonus. Not much is added, but since the original version of base building is already quite good, it remains a solid aspect of the game. [spoiler] The alien bases are also better designed. It feels more like an organic base, as opposed to some rectangular blocks haphazardly put together. [/spoiler]
5. Learning curve. A tutorial has been added to the game. It is not entirely unhelpful, but more could be given to direct new players and help them learn the mechanics. I personally believe that having a good solid tutorial instead of forcing the players to learn from their mistakes or look up help from community forums is a crucial factor for the success of any game with a steep learning curve. Having a tutorial is surely a slightly improvement, but much could still be done. 

[h1]Disappointments: [/h1]
1. AI. The enemies are supposed to be more advanced, and yet their tactics can often be summarized as ""run in front of you and shoot you"". They rarely fight as a team, and when they do, it feels more like multiple individual aliens fighting you at the same time, rather than a group of aliens cooperates to take you out. The civilian behavior is even more idiotic. They do not hide from aliens, do not run away from aliens, and sometimes charge into UFO while my people are setting up a breach. 
2. Map variety. X1 benefited tremendously from a swarm of community made and often partially automatically generated map packs. By contrast, X2 does not have this feature yet, and the same map would often be encountered multiple times in a play through.",1690277994,1690277994,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Probably not, unfortunately. 

The BIG issue with xenonauts 2 is that not a whole lot has changed from the previous game. If you played xenonauts 1, then you've played a better version of xenonauts 2. Xenonauts 2 has a couple of improvements from the previous game those being:

1. The game is technically 3d now, so you can rotate the camera
2. More enemy variety (technically)

Both of these improvements however, are hard to notice. The game is technically in 3d, but has such a strict adherence to the art style of the previous game (which was 2d) that it feels like a 2d game. You'd be forgiven for forgetting that you can actually rotate the camera this time around because the game feels that flat despite that not actually being the case. 

The increased enemy variety is hard to notice because they all feel and act the same. Given that the sound design across the board is minimal, that doesn't give the developer a whole lot of room to make the new enemies feel unique. Most enemies simply stumble around the map and shoot at stuff. They don't have interesting sounds, mechanics, or tactics, they just shoot at stuff. 

A big thing that needed to be improved from the previous game was the 'aliveness' of the tactical combat. Combat in xenonauts 1 was very sterile, flat, and frankly pretty boring. No effort whatsoever has been made the change that in xenonauts 2. No effort was made to add reloading animations, additional death screams, or even mix up the sound effects from the first game. Its all the exact same. There's a lot of little things that could have been done to make the game feel more alive, and therefore make the combat not feel so flat. If you played the combat missions in xenonauts 1, then you played the combat missions in xenonauts 2. The only difference being that you can rotate the camera now. I wish that was hyperbolic, but its not. No other improvements were made to this part of the game. 

Overall Xenonauts 2 is a pretty massive disappointment. Theres alot that could be done to improve this game, but, given that Goldenhawk Interactive literally consists of just 1 dude now, I don't think thats gonna happen. The game has had a moderately successful launch, but the plan for the game's development is literally just to finish the final third of the campaign and be done with it.

Now ""Xenonauts 2"" has landed (in Early Access) and is (at least for me) better then its own predecessor in every way (also i can't play Xeno 1 on current Hardware - my eyesight can't manage a 5 Pixelfont).

So would i recommend it in its current form: Yes, But there is some IF attached:

* The game is not complete (2/3 it says), they plan to be done in 9 Months. Well, they planned to release Xenonauts 2 in 2017/2018. So take that with a huge amount of salt.
* You are a XCom Fan(atic) and know what can happen, like: Shipping 9 Figher to a Mission and get instantly shot when you make your first move.
* You have an SSD to install it to. The loading times are... long. Even with SSD.

If the above is a sound ""YES!"" - then go on. You will have a XCom (or better: UFO - Enemy Unknown) experience just like in the old days but with better gfx and some Quality of Life improvments that are necessary these days.

So far i had no bugs and its a joy to run around and take shots and get shot. Building one or more bases. Sendind Interceptors to roam or fight. Equiping your Soldiers and send them on there merry way. Sometimes they come back, sometimes not.

There are no Mods yet, but i guess that will come sooner or later - and then the fun really begins.

Like many, I'm a little disappointed at how similar it is to the first edition.  But, I also recognize that developers walk a fine line between too new and too old; particularly with beloved titles/remakes like this one.  X-COM was arguably the best game of it's kind made pre-2000.  Therefore, you must be mindful to not mess with it too much.

Things that I've liked in my few hours of playing:
The UI is improved.  This is not something I normally consider, but it's noticeable enough to mention.
Same with sound.  Battle sounds are much better.  Usually way outside my concern (I'm more about function than form).
New mission types--I love the new concept on mission types.  The ""get in/get out"" style of some is compelling.
New maps.  Dev indicates more to come here, but the ones I've seen have been different enough for comment.
The Cleaners--I like this idea, and it makes for a good tactical test.  Also opens up a few mission types.
Improved threat indicator. 

Assuming the developer follows up on what they said, I'm happy with what I've got (and what will be coming).

- It is a hard game, requires tactical thinking and planning in advance.

Cons:
- Still in Beta. The game is not complete, there are missing texts vice versa. Campaign cannot be progressed any further after a specific date / percentage. 
- Cover does not provide enough protection.
- Aliens shoot with 120% accuracy. It is a rare occasion if they miss. One shot or two is enough to turn the player's character into a red goo. Even smoke does not help in most cases.
- Every unit  under the player's control has crossed eyes. 
- I have witnessed all 5 of my team members missing an alien 30 meters ahead with an average of 70%+ hit rate. Hit percentages seems to be inaccurate. 
- Reaction shots of the aliens need to be tuned down.
- A better 'Overwatch' mechanic has to be developed and implemented. 
- Timed missions are terribly designed. 6 turns to complete the objective, after the sixth turn, non-stop reinforcements per each two turns. 
- Cleaner missions require rebalance.
- I believe that the alien accuracy has to be nerfed 10% and player accuracy has to be buffed by the same amount. 
- Weapon balance is all over the place. Skipping magnetics and going for lasers is what everyone is doing at the moment. 
- Rewards provided for capturing live aliens have to be buffed a lot to make that mechanic something actually useful.
- Selling loot reduces the unit price very harshly.

Conclusion: I recommend buying the game. However consider the cons part of my review and keep in mind that yourselves may not be able to continue to the same savefiles when the final release is here.

Unfortunately I have just been left unsatisfied with the current state of the game, and I am genuinely confused and curious as to what all of the development time went into when so much is still missing. Yes, I am fully aware this is an Early Access title, but WHY it's in such a state and has released anyway is beyond me, particularly considering the asking price is is $60 aud and you still quickly run into missing content walls. Honestly, I'm just going to assume this is a case of the publisher forcing a release date on the devs to start getting a return on their investment.

As for actual feed back on what can improve, lack of maps is a big issue, and research likely needs to be re-balanced. Getting tier 3 weapons in the first month is just odd. The strategic layer of the game and atmosphere feels somehow empty, unlike in Xenonauts 1 where the invasion was constantly ramping up and it felt as if humanity was under attack the aliens are just kind of 'here' and doing 'something' in Xenonauts 2. Granted, my complaints about the lacking atmosphere may be fixed as soon as they add content to the game which gives proper context to the invasion. 

Combat is good though for the most part. Good job on that, Goldhawk.

TL:DR - I love this game, but it is incredibly early access and lacking core elements. Go play Xenonauts 1 until this game has actual content.

If you've played Xenonauts 1 this will feel like almost the same game. If you haven't played Xenonauts 1, this is a punishing turn-based strategy game with a somewhat simple overworld layer (more involved than XCOM, but not the focus of the game). Balance is good, your soldiers are fragile, mistakes are punished, meta progression (equipment, tech) is just as important/more important than your soldiers. Closest non-XCOM analogue is probably Battle Brothers.

The timed missions are the main issue people have with the game. I understand why, but they do mix things up. You have to take risks more frequently now. In Xenonauts 1, excepting terror missions and breaching UFOs, with cautious play you could avoid almost every risk. Now, you more frequently have to balance making more risky plays with preserving your soldiers/gear. I don't dislike it and think it will extend the midgame/endgame difficulty, but I see why it's unpopular - you have to treat the entire map as always dangerous once the wave spawning starts. The real strategy is to accept and plan around losses (and bring mooks with riot shields). Snipers in elevated positions on overwatch with long sightlines also helps.
If you are more inclined towards XCOM and want zero losses, a timed mission toggle is being added in an upcoming patch. That being said, I don't think this is a game best played with savescumming, no timers and zero losses - roll with the punches and see how you do.

Recommend if you liked Xenonauts 1 or difficult turn based strategy games. Niche game, difficult game, but if you like this type of game you'll really like Xenonauts 2.",1690216552,1690217837,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Positives: 
1. A slight upgrade from X1 vanilla, but cannot be compared to x-div as for yet.
2. Lore is cool.  
3. Strategy seem good.

5. Storyline is good. 
6. Atmosphere is good. 
7. I like varied objectives apart from always clearing enemies.
8. Game is hard core and doesn't hold your hands <3

Negatives: 
1. Got shot and killed at a rooftop where the enemy had absolutely zero LOS. 
2 a) Entering rooms from a 90 deg angle and triggering reaction shots = meh. 
2 b) Blind fire /peeking around corners should be possible to avoid triggering reactive fire. 
2 c) Cover is not making a difference at all. 20% for sitting behind a concrete wall is WAY to little. 
2 d) Enemy on the other hand can be in open fields and our trained soldiers cant hit shit even at easy. 
2 e) The reason one should have a cover system is for the game to be tactical and make use of flanking moves.
6. Smoke is a joke. Aliens shoot super accurately through the smoke at 100% Accuracy skill. 
7. My GPU sounds like its about to fly to the moon...  No idea why.
8. Miss Jagged alliance Overwatch sectors. IF enemy enter your OS, you gain better reaction time. 
9. First feel was that AI needs love. It doesn't feel like I am playing an intelligent race that are lightyears ahead in technology tactically speaking. 
10. I think the AI should be tactically amazing, but the aliens could be less accurate and powerful, maybe due to the earth being a very poisonous environment for aliens (or some other reason)

It still has plenty of bugs, balance issues and problems with repetition of tactics (spamming smoke is ideal in a lot of situations) while also featuring timed missions that are even tighter clocked than Xcom 2, which already made you feel a lot of pressure on missions.

However, not being limited like the old engine really does enhance the game quite a bit, and it is actually fairly stable in its current state already as I have not encountered any crashes in my playthrough. I'm definitely looking forward to the future of the game.

One thing that I [b] massively [/b] appreciate is the ambient sound that Reapers make when they are closeby. That is a huge improvement compared to the stealth Reapers in the first game. In that sense, sound should play an even bigger role. Would greatly enhance the experience but also make some things seem less unfair by making it clear that there's an enemy stomping in that building right next to you, without having line of sight.

Though, one thing that does still feel odd is the progression. Some things take ages to get rolling, others become available so quickly that it makes some options redundant/obsolete.
Likewise the progression of some objectives can feel rather.. Sudden.

Also, the civilian AI is absolutely suicidal. One just ran in front of an enemy and just stood there. Couldn't do anything but to end his misery. Valve pls fix",1690135563,1690137024,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

For lack of a better term, it felt easier the first month. I wasn't getting any casualties. Then an abduction mission started, and I learned that it wasn't easy, i was just being smart about it. The stuff doesn't feel unfair like Xenonauts 1 does at times. I also like the air combat a decent bit better, even if I have a gripe about missiles feeling a bit underpowered. The game does feel early access, (I'm still saddened that the interrogations haven't been fully added in yet.) but I still enjoy it. 

I have one major problem however. This is at least 50% a skill issue on my part I think, but I find the panic to be far too unforgiving. As far as I know, the only way to reduce panic outside of missions is to shoot down a UFO above a certain airspace. Unlike Xenonauts 1, you don't have enough money to get a trio of fully operational bases up soon, and you are going to feel the pain from that. That and the fact that UFOs seem to actually target bases now, (I think i've only ever had like 2 base attacks through all of my X1 time) I think it actually provides an interesting, if frustrating, conondrum. Build up your bases at the cost of panic where you don't reach, or build multiple bases, and depend on your aircraft to protect the bases while you eventually build them up.

Overall, I'd give the game a 7/10 so far, but given it's still in early access, I imagine that will increase. And one question I've been pondering, is this game set in the same universe as X1, but the aliens didn't invade in 1979, or is it a different universe with similarities?

Base building similar, you can have multiple bases(but you won't have the money), soldier development is similar, so their stats improve, but they will not get special abilities as in the new X-Coms. So you will not have soldiers who can cut a fly in two with a ninja sword and also massacre everyone else on the map in single turn.
The game is difficult, so be prepared and forget abour your ego and play on Recruit,  or accept it to loose a few soldiers in every mission, or of course you can load back every turn many times. The loading screen looks nice, but it is slow, so probably an nvme ssd would help :).

At its current stage it is good game, but you won't be able to finish as it is not complete. I had to force myself to go to bed at 1am, and force myself to stay in bed to get enough sleep :).
There were no tech issues, except one during the tutorial(I had leave it to be able to continue), sometimes it slows down, but nothing serious (it runs fine on a I5-4460).

I will probably play it again when it is out from early access.

XENONAUTS ISN'T MEAN TO BE EASY

This isn't your Firaxis remake of XCOM, where most people enjoy the graphics ad sower (er) pacing and generally fairly well balanced aliens. If you've ever played the original XCOM titles, then you know that stepping out of the dropship and immediately getting a soldier killed is the norm, not the exception. Regular difficulty already says ""for players familiar with the genre"", anything above it is meant for people who have incredible patience, and have crunched all the numbers.

Disliking the game because it hurts your feelings that the starter aliens are strong is a stupid take. You are fighting an alien invasion. You SHOULD be losing troops. You SHOULD be making tough decisions and sacrificing your soldiers and equipment for tactical or strategical gains. If you didn't have to, them game wouldn't be the same.

That's not to say that it's all sunshine and rainbows, missing 4-5 80% shots in a row is frustrating, but that happens. If you don't like it, just load back the turn. Nobody is forcing you to play Ironman if you don't like the RNG, nobody will judge. But don't give a negative review because you think it makes the game hard.

Now that the difficulty question is out of the way, let's address the other big issue people have with the game: content, or rather, the lack thereof.

I have about 20 hours in the game now, and I just reached the end of the content. For 30$. I've had an absolute blast during those 20 hours, and I intend to replay it again on a harder difficulty. Still, it is true that a lot of the fun mid-late game content is missing. A lot of the fun, later alien vessels are still missing, so does the variety of interceptors compared to the previous game. The alien variety is pretty decent already, enough to make most missions quite fun to play, and the biome types that do exist all look gorgeous, and I think there is very little difference in the variety compared to Xenonauts 1. You have a few sets of armor that are more than enough to get you going through the game, as well as a few upgrades to weapons as well as weapon types that are quite nice. There's already quite a lot of content in the game, as long as you don't mind unlocking some of them for ""no reason"", as there is not a solid ending to the campaign yet.

Overall, pretty good, the content already there is great and it rarely feels like nothing is going on. Hopefully we can get content updates in the near future.

And last, but not least, the overall player experience in Xenonauts 2 is MILES ahead of Xenonauts 1. It was a clunky game at times, with the 2D engine making some things really difficult to do, and generally unpleasant. Shooting especially was just... lackluster. In this title however, doing anything is a joy. The new engine looks gorgeous, the enemies and soldiers look great and have good animations (for a top-down tactical shooter), and it feels like most of the work really went into making a cohesive, fluid experience, no matter the mission type you go on. Never had a stutter or a crash, never got an alien turn bugged, and the UI is incredibly easy to read with everything right where you'd expect it to be.

Additionally, I want to commend the music in the game, it is absolutely fantastic, and after listening to other things during my time playing Xenonauts 1, it was refreshing to have a tense, exciting soundtrack in the background, with great sound effects for most actions (except explosions, they are still pretty terrible)

Overall, X2 is an improvement over it's predecessor in every way, except for content, which we know is on the way. For the people disappointed about the lack of it, the game has been developed slowly over the years, and despite at times seeing like it would never come out, it is finally here. With the influx of cash, why is now the time to be a pessimist about getting new content? Given some time and love, and the addition of modding tools, Xenonauts 2 will become a game with much more content and possibilities than Xenonauts 1, and it is already a much more exciting and fun game to play. If you love the genre and you liked playing the original XCOM games (or the new ones on harder difficulties), then there's a good chance you'll enjoy Xenonauts 2 as well.",1690116267,1690116267,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

This is an EXCELLENT new addition to the mix. I just got the ""You've played all of the content"" message at 18 hours.

The UI is great, there's a TON of options for research, weapons, upgrades, etc. There's an excellent mix of aliens and the lore is definitely worth reading. The battle mechanics are extremely solid and the weapon varieties all feel different but still viable. Pistols are actually deadly and shotguns absolutely feel satisfying. Also, the scale of combat is great. There are a lot more long range engagements and cover matters a lot. A sniper in an elevated position can absolutely snipe the hell out of a target in the open at FAR range. And that goes for the aliens too. Leave a guy standing out in the up and he WILL get shot in the face. 

Speaking of, the combat is HARD. I played on normal with extra enemies. Again, I'm very familiar with this type of game. I was absolutely getting my ass handed to me in the early game. The enemies are accurate and deadly. And I really wish there was a way to get additional cover / defense (Currently you can only crouch. Perhaps a ""lay down"" option so they can't get head shot right over the cover they're crouching behind. With the timed missions, it gets a little silly. The only way I was able to do those was: 1) play the mission, just bee line across the map and figure out where the VIP is. 2) Reload (LONG reload times), remember where the VIP is and go straight there in force. Even doing that, the reinforcements still came in hot and fast. 

There are also some good innovations (jet packs) and the vehicles are really well implemented. They only take the place of 1 soldier, they're strong, versatile and up-gradable through research. And the idea of having a cheaper base defense version was brilliant. Armor types are meaningful choices and well implemented. Same with the equipment and the different explosive types (frag grenades, C4, charges, flashbangs, smoke) all have different strengths and you will absolutely want to use them in different situations. 

Aerial combat is rough but they acknowledge that in game. It has potential to be fun. 

There are, however, a few complaints:

- There are a hand full of different variety of timed missions (get in, eliminate a target, get out because endless reinforcements overwhelm you). A) I HATE timed missions in games like this. Hate them with a passion. B) The timer on the  reinforcements felt very fast. I played with extra enemies selected and I barely even had time to progress across the map and find the target before I was swarmed with reinforcements. An option to opt out of these types of missions at game start would be great or perhaps some way to permanently eliminate reinforcement in mission.

- The economy is HARD. Everything costs a LOT of money. Damn near every major milestone upgrade (and there are a LOT of them) is $250,000 - $500,000. When you're rapidly trying to keep up with the alien advances (which also felt quite fast), building new bases, building new equipment, etc, it's incredibly hard to keep up with the threat. 

To be fair, that makes for compelling game choices but it also felt a little too fast. I had barely gotten upgraded lasers on my A team before I unlocked the next tier. On the note of fast, panic also seemed to start fast. Again, I hate games with timers, so I started off with 10 panic global. I got 3 bases up and running and still had a country panic. There should be additional ways to reduce panic and a major event, like removing an alien base, should have a big drop in panic. 

So again, the campaign pacing definitely felt off. I felt like everything (research, alien threat, UFO types, enemy types, etc) could be slowed down and stretched out a little. Give me time (and enough money) to actually try out my new toys, set up a B and C team, without feeling like I'm in a hyper fast arms race with the aliens and that I'm losing.

- Grenade launchers just...suck. Which sucks. They're just explosive bullets that travel in a straight line. They're also extremely weak. You'll often do more damage with a normal rifle round than planting a grenade on it's face. I was hoping for the ability to arc in shots from an angle, exploding on contact with the ground, but that's not what we've got currently. Boo.

The tactical combat is epic, but needs some better mechanics for guiding civilians and soldiers to safe zones. The various alien types are very intimidating in all the right ways, they add a ton of spice to the game.  Raiding cleaner bases the second time, I noticed they actually retain the damage from previous raids and begin to repair themselves and set up scaffolding. The only thing that does change is the location of the cell leaders. Incredible attention to detail.
 
However, the strategic map desperately needs more depth, although the base-building and research features are truly rewarding due to the base layout being used when you are raided, cool scaling up mechanics and techs, etc. What needs a little more loves is number of vehicle types, different weapons and builds, etc. The game already offers a good amount of freedom for builds, but it needs more. This is 30 dollar game (on sale) after all, not a flash game. 

There is no way to communicate with the superpowers of the world that are funding you, and, while the American and Russian army units are more effective than those of other countries, their AI is still brain dead. I wish soldiers had more unique traits, but that's optional. More pressingly, I wish that there was a way to bombard alien positions and bases before combat, at the price of less salvaged materials. It's very odd that I have air superiority and am allowed to land without incident, but still have no intelligence on the map.

Multiple human factions with different ideas about the aliens would be a great addition. 

Finally, there are still many bugs in this game. Currently my soldiers are getting fucking laser beamed through smoke grenade effects like they're not even there. Which would make sense if it was aliens with accuracy abilities, but it's just the Cleaners. At the moment this is making my second play through a huge slog, as grenades are vital for breaching.

At the end of the day, this game will get you invested, especially if you enjoy this style of retro graphics and tactical depth like me. However, there are flaws and unfinished systems due to the games early access status.",1690058319,1690058675,True,11,0,0.598540306091308594,0,True,False,True

First are obvious bugs, like enemy knowing your position without visual sight, shooting through solid walls etc...

Then some design flaws many of which should get solved just by adding content - like shallow research tree, uninteresting weapon choices, weird calculations of hit chances and coverages... -_-
Terrible AI - also I believe it's going to be fixed hopefully, like civilian running to hide 2m from enemy.
Terrible time missions forcing you to run into one overwatch after another simply because you barely have time to finish objective, not speaking of actual enemies.
Burst fire seems to be simple... useless? Never have I seen it as viable option.

And some major flaws.
Like stopping all action once you shoot at enemy... because he got somehow drained of will to do anything... what?!
Endless enemy overwatch hell.
Solder individual progressions where professional soldiers are morons to give their progression meaning... I know it's for gameplay but it still feels unsolved after so many x-com games - there was nice discussion about focusing more on organization instead of individual progress to also promote that it's not that big of a deal to lose units.

*********
Wins:

Tactical layer is really nice - lots of useful info appears on screen in context-sensitive bites (for example, aiming on enemies with short summary info over the target and a more detailed breakdown in a sidebar)

No bugs encountered so far. No crashes, no freezes. 

Updates - patches are coming out regularly with tweaks to gameplay and content.

Lethality - X2 has so far shown itself to be pretty lethal, which is just how it should be for a UFO:EU -inspired game.




Gripes:

The strategy layer is not quite perfected - some elements are being developed (UFO Aerial Combat) and some needs balancing (frequency of UFO appearances relative to Panic - basically you need to be able to shoot down more UFOs in order to keep a lid on the rising Panic due to the activities of your treacherous human enemies the Cleaners).

Switching between strategic and tactical layers currently involves some lengthy loading screens.

No voice dialogue! XCOM spoiled us I know, and it's a shame we can't hear just how annoying our chief scientist really is :-)

Occasional interface oops - sometimes when right-clicking to re-orient a soldier I've accidentally opened a UFO door and got blasted by what was on the other side...

Dumb civilians - I've had civvies walk in my line of fire; block doorways and ladders; and even wander into UFOs and nearly get my squad killed. Actually, this has been a lot of fun too so not such a gripe after all. Grrr.

I experienced some crashes that were fixed after 2 days.
The pacing, as many said it, feels too quick, I would prefer longer discoveries, building equipment, gearing up the soldiers, building the new ships, expanding to other bases etc. But these are more like balancing rather than completely new development.

Some complained about the graphics, it is a bit simple but the UI feels quite functional and not dated - in comparison I loaded up openXcom on my 4k monitor, cried when I saw the graphics at this resolution, then cried some more when I realized I can't rotate the map, before I quickly closed the game. I love the original Xcom but it just doesn't seem playable.

Well, I hope Xenonauts 2 will be a similarly complex game that I will be able to replay many times. It certainly has the potential.

If I had to mention my favorite thing, it would be the base attack! I love the base building and base attack that is infinitely better than what Firaxis did.
My least favorite part is the interceptors, I struggle even on Easy difficulty by them being destroyed all the time. I am not entirely sure which weapons I should use, maybe I should have 3 or 4 ceptors in a base? feels overkill. So this part needs more development, and balancing, for sure. Ideally this would end up at least as good, but preferably better than the original Xcom, which was a bit lacking in this department.

Anyway I wish good luck to the devs, I played 15 hours so far which is more than I played some completed games for.

This game on early access release operates surprisingly smoothly, I am not deep in so cannot testify to the quality of the lore and story but so far good, a new combat mechanic allows a pre-prediction of move-and-shoot command which is quite nice and adds a new level of tactical thinking. Everything is modernized, graphics are better, and is essentially a reboot of X1, for returning fans great, and for new entrants will be good also if they like the traditionally turn-based system. No doubt plenty of game balancing and bugs to correct so I would not advise nonfans to play this yet until full release, but in 1 -2 years with the community involved I suspect like X1 there will be a modded version.

1) Ship combat is horribly broken and unfinished right now (even the ingame message warns you of this). Not only is it buggy and unresponsive, but they made your ships weaker and enemy ships stronger. No one needed that.

2) Progression is borked. I ran into higher level aliens in my first 2-3 missions. Sebillians with high armor and regeneration? With raw recruits and ballistic weapons? Ouch.

3) Timed missions. Seriously, I love having new enemies in the game, but their missions are timed, which most people on the forums seem to hate, like me. They said they will add time options in the future, so that will help.

4) It *FEELS* like you land for ground combat with every alien waiting for you in overwatch as opposed to patrolling. Others have mentioned similar, especially in the timed missions where you have to boogie.You can't afford to move slow and defensive, but aliens have full TUs and are waiting for you.

5) They took away the ability to research and engineer multiple things at once. 

6) Many upgrades are awful. Getting laser weapons, for example, is big downgrade until later when you get tech upgrades for it. Getting new tech should make you feel like accomplishment is happening. 

7) There are many bugs where smoke, suppression, and other things are not working as intended. Civilian lives don't matter right now, if they ALL die, no government in the game cares. And the civilian AI right now is so broken it feels like a 5 year old wrote the code. They get saved and run INTO alien faces and even their ships, lol.

It's got enough content, and being ported to Unity must've been quite a challenge for the team. Hope that makes it easy to add more content.

That said, it's what you expect from an xcom like game, with some variation from the formula (but definitely not enough). I HOPE, with the help of the plot ([spoiler] Aliens are actually earthlings from parallel dimensions [/spoiler]) we get way more variation of enemies. 
So far there's a couple of flavours of gray, absolute CANCER cloaked enemies that never fucking miss, heavy lizard fellas, brain, and big brain. That and the human enemies which I think only use rifles, and the sentries you can build for your own base. 

Maps are ok, I think there's enough variation for now, with both close combat maps and somewhat open maps. The playstyle can diverge a bit from the beginning where you just pray to not get hit, by researching weapons that hit harder, armor that lets your peeps survive a shot or two, and jetpacks.

Controversial opinion, I think the plane combat is fine, but needs more plane upgrades/ hardpoints for systems. Stuff like automatic dodging, temporary invisibility, more missile types, shields, etc can spice up the combat. Of course the enemies will get these options too.

Uh, I had some crashes between missions that were very annoying, but restarting the game fixed it somehow. Game's still pretty fucking RAW.

The visual re-imagining of the original world works incredibly well and feels great, my only visual gripe is that additional camera options would be nice e.g. As amazing as it is being able to turn the camera i can't always quite see what i need to with the 90deg rotation. Always love Goldhawk's universe with Xenonauts and this game hits it's stride well thematically.

Globally, Airgame is particularly rough but it's already on the Dev Roadmap, so i'll leave that as it is. The economy has suffered because of a step backwards in user friendliness / UI E.g. Battlefield loot is explained way less in terms of what is important and what should be sold. Rough around the edges but totally manageable overall with clear room for growth.

Tactically I've noticed some pretty absurd shots where the enemy feel like they have a different set of rules (even accounting for XCOM-esq RNG bending me over) but as long as you don't mind a couple turn reloads it's again, totally manageable and has room for improvement AI wise.

Overall I still really, really enjoy this, it just needs a couple more minutes in the oven.

 Being a Xenonauts 1 Veteran, I know how the game should play. Research piles up and you can't finish it all quickly enough. Air combat is painful and your jets don't work as well as they did in Xenonauts 1. There's a lot of placeholder screens and texts whenever you interrogate an Alien of any sort. The Terror Site maps are the same rotation and spawn point every time. The ammo types for Laser and Gauss weapons are not interchangeable. (I found that out the hard way)

Yet still, I enjoy it. It brings me back to my very first crew in the original game. I played a lot of Xenonauts 1 in 2015, naming every one of my soldiers after friends at school. There are some pros, especially the ground vehicles. These tiny tanks are much better than the colossal behemoths of the game before. The stability of the game is much better than the Original game. I've only had one crash out of 17 hours compared to Xenonauts 1 which would have likely crashed 3 times in that same span. 

The Devs have been working on this game since 2017. I still remember the first demos coming out for it, and playing the living shit out of them. It's not a complete game, and I can't advise that you play it unless you're here to watch it grow. They're relying on the same formula that made Xenonauts 1 such a good game, and it feels a little inauthentic.

In terms of what this game does new compared to the previous game I won't touch too much on. Instead I want to talk more about the merits of the game design compared to how the genre has advanced since the earlier era.

As an old school game aimed at the hardcore folks, this game is fundamentally not balanced nor friendly towards newcomers. It is also, after spending about 12 hours of trial and error, not that fun due to a lack of viable different strategies.  I am not saying that hard games should not exist. I play many other strategy games on their hardest mode, having beaten Total War, Expeditions: Rome, Wasteland 3, Low Turn Count Fire Emblems, Wesnoth etc. Rather, the core gameloop does not feel fun, and the process of learning the game is far too painful. In short, the game mechanics I feel is not respectful of my time as a player, and overly frustrates me. 

Due to the high difficulty, there's basically one strategy towards combat that somewhat works, which makes every battle feel the same, no matter how much the map changes. The developer attempts to add mission variety to alleviate this problem, but the problem with the new mission types is that the fundamentals of the game do not support player enjoyment of those new mission types. Enemies will one shot player units in timed missions where the player instead of advancing slowly are forced to rush forward. Depending on the game map snipers may or may not be useless. RNG is a heavy factor that basically solely penalizes the player. Mission time counts seem designed to not only assume the player knows the perfect strategy and is deploying it (not possible for a new player), but also that the player gets perfect or near perfect RNG, has perfect prior knowledge of the map, and brought specific things to combat. All on the second mission of the game. Extremely long reload times and unfriendly learning curves aside, once a player does learn all of this, each battle is basically a repeat of the exact same strategy (slow SWAT simulator), as the difficulty does not allow any other strategies to work.

FWIW One of my friends who *does* play XCom significantly also did not recommend this game to me. As another reference, playing Expeditions:Rome on the hardest difficulty blind for the first time took me about 1 hour to figure out how to beat the first map thanks to lucky RNG, and another 1 hour to actually figure out how to do it without relying on RNG. Playing Xenonaughts 2 on the ""normal"" mode took me 6 hours and that was relying on perfect RNG.",1690001226,1690001226,False,109,9,0.77159649133682251,0,True,False,True

Often times I'm not really happy with sequels as I'd rather see a remake or re-do of the first game because it was so good.  For example, I loved the recent XCOM remake by Firaxis and absolutely hated XCOM 2 as it steered too far away from the concept of the original X-COM series.  XCOM 2 did some great things and it wasn't a bad game (still very good) but I personally kinda wish Firaxis expanded more on the original and aligned it a bit closer to the original 94' X-COM and conclusion rather than the scenario of 'what if' the aliens won.   

Xenonauts 2 is just want I wanted, not a nonsense sequel like XCOM 2.  It's more of a new take on Xenonauts 1,with better graphics and some quality of life updates that just wasn't possible on X1.  (Thank you devs for supporting Ultrawide!).  While it's not prefect and there is a lot missing due to being in early access like a lot place holder descriptions and late game stuff missing, what we have here now, I'm liking it.   

The combat can be pretty tough at first but do not be afraid to lose soldiers, they will die, just keep pressing on as it is all part of the experience.   You will eventually come up with strategies to get through most situations.  Combat feels better in X2 over the first one but I'm still on a wait and see approach if things improve even more than they did in X1 as the bones of that game are largely still here, good and bad.   

Make sure you are collecting a lot of materials for research and manufacturing as you will need an edge in air superiority and on the ground.  Don't try and get too relaxed as you'll find mid-late game to be extremely challenging to take down alien ships if you haven't kept up with tech or produced enough Phantoms or upgraded Angels.  What I like is that when Scientists or Engineers are idle in this game they seem to be generating you an income I didn't realize until later but building up your staff is very useful.

additionally explosives are in a weird place, they don't feel like they do the damage they should, and i hate how you cant throw more than one grenade a turn. additionally, you cant throw items unless they're explosives, which means throwing your medkit at an injured soldier isnt an option anymore, which is unfortunate",1689993483,1689993483,False,9,0,0.506885528564453125,0,True,False,True

What I like about the sequel: The ground combat seems to be much more manageable with a better learning curve compared to the first game. You don't find yourself getting swarmed too much in the early game. Of course you'll likely still have deaths, this is Xenonauts after all, but that's all part of the challenge of this game. The tutorial helps newer players get to know the game better, introduce them to the mechanics and allow them to learn from there. A lot of the time, it will seem like aliens have an unfair advantage, though that often gets me to find new ways of dealing with each enemy. And this game provides me with the opportunity to find new ways of combating my foes. Another thing I like about this game is how the auto-resolve feature for intercepting UFOs works, allowing me to either save time, or if I don't like how the auto-resolve results came out, to command the air battle myself.

What I don't like about the game so far: The strategical element. Mainly with how the Cleaners work. They raise panic far too frequently, raising it by 2 points every time an event happens because of them. And there are several events that could happen in a single week alone. The only way to reliably reduce panic is to shoot down UFOs. There are also some missions that also reduce panic, but they spawn far too infrequently to really be of any use. 

As for the UFOs, it feels like the game often doesn't spawn enough of them, causing panic to rise quickly due to the Cleaners. This is usually during the early game. Later on, the game spawns UFOs that are often too strong for your interceptors to reliably deal damage to them. That's if they can catch up to them, given how the speed of UFOs will increase to being much faster than your interceptors, making the fact that they're also much tankier than previous UFOs makes having you to return to your base to refuel will often result in the UFO completing their mission and escaping. Your interceptors seem to take forever to repair, which is increased longer if an interceptor is shot down.

Given these facts, the panic level rises higher than anyone could reasonably manage them, making you lose income from every region despite your best efforts.

After all of that time and having done all of the available content in X2, I'm honestly disappointed. I knew it was EA, but I thought there was only some polish and balance changes left after all this time. In reality it feels like there's half the content of X1.

What I REALLY don't understand is why so many fluff entries after researching stuff are STILL blank, like, just slap in a rough draft. It's not like you're going to introduce some wild bug in the tech text. 

I DO appreciate that there are more varieties of missions though, and it really helps break up the tedium of doing the same 'kill everything' objective over and over again.

I gotta say I'm having a great time. The UI and environments are very easy to understand and the mechanics are fairly intuitive. I've started over multiple times (the game-creation/difficulty settings are pretty robust) and its very satisfying to get better every time, and not just because I have a better idea of what's coming.

I haven't encountered any bugs I've noticed and the performance is pretty solid, minus some small stuttering when some objects come into vision (I haven't found a consistent pattern)

A much better start than the first Xenonauts game - far closer to the original X-Com game from the 90s. Still missing key details from the 90s game however.

Things they have improved from Xenonauts 1:
The Battlescape is so much better.
There are cinematics and more narrative elements
Improved UI
There are new types of missions (though I think the balance needs tweaking)
A new enemy faction
New vehicles

Some features that are in the 90s X-Com but still not in this so far:
Spinning spherical world map in geoscape
Multiple research threads happening at once
Buying and selling of basic equipment (and being able to turn a base into a factory)
Having extra items available on a mission but not on a person
Laser weapons infinite ammo - this was important as it made laser weapons feel fundamentally unique and allowed for turtle style battlescape plays.

I appreciate the attempt and Xenonauts 2 is a much better a starting point than the Xenonauts 1 but for diehards of the original game it still does not reach all the details yet. The original felt like a government secret agency base building simulator with a fantastic turn based strategy game within it. This still feels like its just being the turn based strategy and thus loses a lot of the magic.

It is obviously still early access and thus I would expect many tweaks for balance - it seems very odd to be able to lose with just two funding sectors leaving you for example as I would expect that to change with the difficulty (and perhaps have its own slider?). There are also some texts that are just placeholder for now too. I look forward to seeing what the team do.

Would I recommend this game? 
Yes, certainly to new comers it is much clearer how to play and has a small tutorial. 
To everyone who has played Xenonauts 1 I would recommend getting it for the battlescape improvements but I would not blame you if you wait until it is out of early access and has mods available.
For those that are diehard fans of the original X-com I am afraid OpenXCom is still your best bet. Though hopefully this will improve and may even get very close with modded support later on.

Overall I do like some of the ideas the Xenonauts 2 team have had in this game but I would very much like to see them implemented in a game that is missing none of the elements from the original 90s X-Com game so we can finally have a genuine improvement upon the original rather than just another copy failing to understand what made it so great.",1689982778,1689982778,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

- The game flavor is pretty much the same as the original, with some cosmetic changes, changes to the storyline, and minor tweaks to the game mechanics
- engineering projects and research are now done ONE AT A TIME.  You can't, for example, assign 20 researchers to laser weapons and 20 to new aircraft weapons at the same time; you'll only get to research ONE thing.   Construction of materials, on the other hand, will let you queue up orders... but they'll still only work on one at a time.    I find this mildly annoying, but not a dealbreaker.
- the initial (""early"") release will only follow the campaign/storyline so far.   For the reset of it, you'll have to wait on further releases.
- graphics are more polished and nicer than X1.   They're not as ultra-realistic as modern FPS games, but ... do they really need to be?  [I'm not really graphics-motivated in my gaming].
- So far, its got the ""usual suspects"": sectoids, sebillians, wraiths.   They have some support critters that weren't in the original, though. 
- notably missing are the Androns; maybe in the future updates?
- I'll probably miss mentioning something (I'll try to add it later if I do) but other than the above, the game pretty much plays exactly the same as X1:   Build base, hire soldiers, research new toys, intercept UFOs, raid the shoot-downs or the landers, terror attacks, alien bases... etc etc.  

SO DO I LIKE IT?

Short answer is YES... provisionally.   I'm expecting better stuff as the early release gets more detail out.   

Prophetically, I will say this:   I like X2 better than the stock X1.    But currently, I do NOT like it better than X1 with the X DIVISION mod.

a grenade launcher that DOES  NOT ARC. You could replace the skin with a rocket launcher and literally no one would know the difference. Whats the point of a grenade launcher that behaves like a rocket launcher but only does grenade damage? its useless.

Shield class is useless and will get your soldier killed.

No way of looking at ANY of your soldiers stats in mission. 

The Ufo combat one of the worst mechanics ive ever used in a game. Its cheese the ai the mini game. 

Hardest difficulty on ironman cannot be achieved without using the horrible ufo combat system. SO your forced to use a half baked alpha mechanic the MOST people HATED from the first game and/or always turned off in prefrence to auto resolve.

If 80% of your player base is turning off a mechanic because its so objectively awful why would you keep it in the game? Whats the point? What was wrong with xcoms air combat system?",1689956959,1689956959,False,4,0,0,0,True,False,True

They've added more timed missions where enemies keep spawning, and in a genre this unforgiving, that's just not very fun. It feels like the only way to win is heavily save scumming. 

I will say that the new UI and Engine are very nice. being able to rotate the camera is a very much welcomed addition.

One remarkable aspect that sets this game apart from others of its style is the challenging learning curve it presents from the outset.

As someone who tends to reload frequently, I can attest that the effort put into learning the best strategies and persevering through the initial challenges reaps great rewards later in the game.

Game is a very faithful sequel to Xenonauts 1 and, spiritually, the original XCOM games. It looks, plays and feels like a game the late 90's/early 2k. If thats what you're after go nuts. But don't expect anything else.

I got this expecting a more.. 2020's version of Xenonaughts or XCOM, but its not, its really just more of the same. Which isn't really a bad thing, if you like that sort of game. But, the one thing I really cannot endorse, and is the reason why i refunded, is the cost.. Asking $60 aud for a game like this really feels like a rip off, IN MY OPINION. 

Also, I really don't know how it took this long to get to this.. ""early access"" stage.. 

Devs or publishers, whoever push these games out with minimum content into early access really need to learn that they put the empty shell of a game out into early access and a good portion of potential players try the game, see how empty or unpolished it is, then refund or simply never return to the game.

They have somehow managed to make the game too fast and too slow at the same time

Research: Way too fucking fast

Engineering: Somehow it has too fast and too slow moments on

Income: Painful! Absolutely Impossibly Painful

Aircraft Repairs: In 4 days, the base aircraft has repaired 6%. 4 Days. At that rate it will take over 100 days to fix the plane. I have 10 Engineers and the 1st Upgrade to the Engineer Facility but it takes over 100 days to fix a plane? Not even the upgraded planes

Enemies: Insanely Fast, I watched an enemy move, throw a grenade, move again, shoot his gun, and then move a 3rd time.
I look at the TU requirements to do that: 50% for the grenade alone. Umm.... What?
Enemy weapons basically ignore armor, they added a hardness and penetration system so the starting Defender Armor? Is actually a trap, for your money, it's useless because no alien weapon has below 15 penetration. So even stacked with a rifle plate, straight through. Further, upgraded armor is pretty useless too. Your soldiers are basically disposable.
Enemy Accuracy even on the Easiest Difficulty is: They don't Miss. Ever. Except the Scillians because they have a specific debuff to miss. But otherwise, expect if the aliens can shoot they will hit and you will die.

I know the concept very vell, aliens are suposed to be stronger, hard to deal with and people will die.

In a new battle, run my sniper forward, spot an enemy, 86% hit chance. Fire. Miss. Enemy Overwatch returns fire. Hit. 22 damage to my sniper.

Reload save to the beginning of the turn. Move my sniper to the exact same tile. Spot enemy. 86% hit chance. Fire. Miss in the exact same place as previously. Enemy Overwatch returns fire. Hit. 22 damage to my sniper.

Reload again. Exact same result again.

Reload AGAIN. Exact same result AGAIN!

Must've tried this about 20-30 times now. Same result EVERY time. 

I don't how the game calculates these chances, but I take 86% percent hit chance to mean that I should be hitting 8-9/10 times if you play the exact same scenario 10 times over. I don't really understand why the hit/miss chances aren't being applied at the moment of firing, as this is what the game implies is happening by indicating your chances of hitting in this way.

I understand that the game is in early access but this seems like a core feature of the game that is already considered finished. Knowing that the chance indicator is not only inaccurate, but that the EXACT SAME thing occurs literally every time makes the outcome seem totally predetermined and has completely taken the fun out of the game for me.

What's odd is that was definitely not the case in the original Xenonauts.

The game is very similar to the original, it isn't a sequel in the traditional sense and is better described as a ""do-over"" of the original. Many of the rough edges from Xenonauts 1 are polished over, the game has a nice (faithful) new coat of paint, and many new improvements to the tactical gameplay. New ways of planning moves, new types of attacks, even the ability to rotate the camera is a big help.

Some may not like that Xenonauts 2 isn't a large evolution from the original, and that currently the missing content and early access nature of the game has it compare poorly to the original. The missing content can be felt. But I don't think we need an enormous evolution from Xenonauts 1. Xenonauts 1 was a great game, and Xenonauts 2 wants to recapture the great foundation of the original game while expanding and improving on the parts that needed it.

All the good parts of the old are still here! There's some great new additions! The new mission types really added something that was missing from the first game; where almost every mission played out as ""search and destroy"". Tweaked base management, new Aliens, a new story and a new enemy to spice up the strategic map.

To developers - a lot of great new features, it is really convenient to go trough the usual loop of positioning soldiers and waiting for the next turn

Two suggestions for improvement:

1. Shooting animation - right after shot is completed, soldier immediately lowers its gun, which feels a bit not serious / cartoonish. Would be great to keep aiming state until bullet reaches or misses the target

2. When pressing tab camera is centered to the active solider - would be nice to not do it by default and make it center only on double press.

I like the way they've rebooted it with the new ""Cleaner"" faction. The new graphics, UI etc look pretty cool and I like the designs of the enemies and weapons. New QOL features are nice but expected in a sequel, especially one which has been in development for this long (looks like the devs need some help in earned value because evidently time spent is not equalling work accomplished).

One thing I really enjoy is how the world is 3D yet still looks like a traditional 2D isometric game (like Xenonauts 1 on the face of it).

I agree the base price is too much, though. Costs more than Xenonauts did at launch and has no real new features. Coming off another playthrough of the excellent (admittedly higher budget) XCOM 2 WOTC, I miss having abilities/perks/etc to unlock on soldiers (can be incorporated through the medal system or attached to specific pieces of equipment). While I do enjoy the tactical nature of Xenonauts compared to the fantasy sci-fi of XCOM 2, there is a lack of variety here especially compared to the original.

Having had a mere taste of Xenonauts 2 after some missions, I can say that tactical combat is much improved and has greater depth to it. Everything feels far more fluid, fairer than 1 and there's a greater emphasis on narrative story telling.

I'm not a big fan of the writing elements between these 'narrative' takes that involve the Chief Scientist, Operations Director and the Commander. For a game that has a wonderful aesthetic of cold-war military realism grounded in reality, a lot of that is lost through the casual disregard for the player avatar: You. At times the Commander is berated, seemingly told what to do in a manner not befitting their station and generally this is done for comedic effect but it takes away the feeling that you are part of a military organisation; it's immersive breaking, simple as.

I could go on more about how this particular style grates me, but as a creative writer it's always something that stands out more for me. 

A lot of the other elements are still missing. Air combat for example is not worth reviewing because it's not been implemented fully. But ground combat, which is the meat of the experience, has been greatly improved.

Xenonauts 2, at the moment anyway, feels like a remaster of the first one. Very few studios can get away with developing a sequel that is essentially the same game but just much more improved, while slapping on a sequel title to it. It's clear a lot of passion has gone into this 're-imagining' of the first game and despite my feelings that they may have played it 'too safe' I very much look forward to playing the full experience.",1689842629,1689842629,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

TLDR. This game feels like a buggy engine upgrade and big update to the first. 

So first of all, the game is very unpolished and unfinished. the ground combat has bugs but is so far not much different then the first game. currently the air to air combat is not fun and does not work but the game does give you a clear warning that it is unfinished.

Positives however is the 3d graphics I think look ok, but the animation and sound design are a huge improvement, the machine gun feels powerful and sounds amazing. There are new mission types which I think are really interesting, there are the classic terror attacks and wreckage fights. A few new missions have appeared I will not spoil but are very diffrent, one of which you need to extract to your helicopter instead of just killing everyone so I think thats really cool.

My biggest issue with the game is actualy the Xenopedia and the story. I feel like its being told in a rush where the first game it was slowly learning about your enemy while struggling against them. where in this game I learned the origins barely part way in my playthrough by researching the first shipped i downed. and while its super interesting I felt very underwhelmed. 

I cant say if the ai has improved or not.

there are positives and negatives. I really hope this game turns out to be amazing and better then its predecessor. I just hope they get it right.

It is all Time Units (TU), that you use for every action. Leaving enough at the end of your turn to fire your weapon (even twice or more if you have enough TU), crouching takes 4 TU, weapons all take different amounts for different firing modes, grenades, demo charge, etc. So you have way more options for how you treat each turn and each soldier.

Currently, this is basically just an updated version of Xenonauts 1 with a stronger engine, 3D maps, and improved performance and QoL enhancements....which means you still get more original content at a cheaper price than what came with the Kerbal Space Program 2 Early Access launch.

--------

I'm updating this review to note the common refrain in the reviews here about how the accuracy of the enemies seems to be grossly imbalanced. Since I read that ahead of time before playing the first few hours, I decided to keep some records on the data over a few missions.

Average enemy rounds fired at my squad members per mission: 73
Average hits on my squad members by the enemy: 69 (hehe)

That is an astonishing 94% hit rate/accuracy rate by the enemy in this game.

My average rounds fired at the enemy (not including grenades/explosives) 57
My average rounds impacted on the enemy: 25

That's a more ""reasonable"" 43% (assuming the general rule that 50% is a ""good"" medium).

Granted, there are additional variables like range and what not that probably skew these numbers one way or the other for a few percentage points (but not 50 percentage points), but there were a [i]number[/i] of missions where the AI hit my squad member with a pistol from at least half the map away, and this happened consistently.

Now, I understand the lore idea that the enemy has better tech, better weapon compensation, better targeting computers, #whatever, and I'm all for that. But there has to be an acknowledgement here that when a game is THIS imbalanced regarding AI accuracy it transcends any story/world crafting the developers are attempting to do. 

Additionally, the cover system here appears to be a mere suggestion as there didn't appear to be any negative aim penalty added to the AI's aiming when my team was behind cover.

1) Not much new, it's just prettier with a few new mechanics but at this point it is still very underdeveloped, making it feel shallower than X1.

The previous game exists and has plenty of mods, and plays almost identically and none of the things that have been extremely annoying in the first one have really been fixed.

Biggest example for this are UFO's. You will still spend a tedious amount of time opening and closing UFO doors, trying to get snapshots at aliens hiding inside who WILL reaction fire your dudes unless you spam flashbangs at them. Mods solved this by allowing you to breach the sides, why haven't any improvements like that made?
This is made doubly annoying by the fact that Shields now no longer block all damage until broken, but just give an overall armor bonus.

Then there's the thing with vehicles. First game had 'em, second one replaced them with robots on wheels. Not a big fan of that, i quite liked Vehicles and wished they would've improved upon the idea to feel different from XCOM.

Like reboot XCOM 2, Xenonauts 2 also added timed missions. These are rather a pain in the behind, and with how extremely squishy your troops are, and how little cover actually does, are now tedious as not losing troops is basically impossible in those missions.

Last but not least one of my biggest pet peeves. Ballistics.
Xenonauts 2 still uses a mishmash of classic XCOM and reboot XCOM, as in ballistics exist and missed shots can hit and damage surrounding units, but still work within a % based hitchance. This means that there can, and will be, occasions where units get hit behind solid cover. 
This has, in my short playtime, happened multiple times, including through roofs.

Now, i would give the dev's a break due to the game being in early access, but it's an sequel and has been in development for a rather long time which is my final point.
Development started around 2015, more likely 2016. That's a bit over 7 years for a almost identical sequel that primarily looks better and has some quality of life improvements and it's still in early access?

Now, Xenonauts 2 is Goldhawks lovechild and i don't doubt it will be finished, fleshed out and probably end up greater than the first game, i am however someone that values my, and fellow gamers(TM), money, and currently it is simply not worth your 30€ (or 40€, when the launch sale is gone), when you can just buy the first title and play that.

Lot of people saying it's exactly the same game, because aesthetically it hasn't changed much. But the differences laid out in planned mission variety, along with the qol stuff, make it worthwhile as a sequel. They are listed here:

https://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/index.php?/topic/34952-what-are-the-differences-between-xenonauts-1-and-xenonauts-2/


Plenty of games are remasters with improvements. Nioh 2 was Nioh 1 with more missions and QoL changes. It re-used animations and boss concepts, which felt shameless. It was still miles better than the first and everyone's favorite in the series--because the core concept was great and there was a lot of mileage they could get out of fixing the problems in the original and adding things. Xenonauts 2 has that kind of potential.

Final edit for the early access review, after playing more: it does play differently than the original. The lizardmen are bullet sponges, but they aren't accurate from a distance, encouraging you to snipe. The little grey dudes start spread out but gradually cluster together and get some kind of accuracy bonus from this clustering--encouraging you to rush. There is variety in the types of missions: previously, downed ships and base invasions and terror sites all had one objective: kill every alien. Now each mission has objectives that allow you to circumvent this. I think it's justified to call this a sequel and the frothing-at-the-mouth negative reviewers need to chill.",1689747886,1689812918,True,1,1,0.4816303551197052,0,True,False,True

I loved Firaxis' XCOM but it always felt like it was lacking a little bit of bite. I am reminded of what Martin Scorsese said about Marvel films (although I could play -- and like -- the Firaxis XCOM games). They were very different and missed something I needed. The Long War remedied this, to some extent, but that ""amusement park"" feel still lingered.

I have participated in megagames with dozens of other lunatics that simulate the world's response to an invading alien menance. Called Watch The Skies. It's an incredible experience, and I always hope games in this genre can emulate that experience.

Xenonauts 1 did this for me, but I found the locked view and general UI frustrating. It felt pretty dated when I picked it up.

Xenonauts 2 is right for me. It's doing what I need. It's not finished. It's not perfect.

I want to send 9 human soldiers to the face of aliens, knowing that probably only 7 will return, and it's probably not one of the rookies. Xenonauts 2 is a game in which mistakes cost lives, and you feel like you're facing off against superior aliens. Only the strong will survive; even then, they are not super soldiers.

When i heard Xenonats 2 was around the corner, I decided to reinstall the first to get back in the saddle and after having now played a decent chunk of the sequel, I have two main points I think are worth sharing.

1) Xenonauts one was a lot more fun than I remembered. Despite this, there were some really major flaws with it that were frankly unfixable, given the engine and how the game was built from the ground up. 

2) Xenonauts 2 is a really solid foundation and solves so many things that annoyed me about the first game. Things like being able to rotate the camera, preview shot angles before moving, and many other quality of life things too numerous to list here. These changes alone make the whole experience so much more enjoyable to engage with and I feel i have much more control over the tactical side of things, so when things go wrong it's more often my fault then the game not displaying the information correctly.

Additionally, adding the cleaners and their impact on the campaign has so far been a very enjoyable addition. The other changes and rebalances of the tech and the aliens have all been welcome changes both from my own play time and from the campaigns i've seen from content creators.

The major complaint I've seen from negative reviews is that this game feels too much like the original Xenonauts. An understandable claim as there is a lot of recycling of design and ideas here. However, just about every asset has had to be made from the ground up for a 3D enviroment. So while things do look very similar and a lot of map designs have been reused, there is very little actual asset recycling. Would you rather these map weren't in the game? Seems like a waste.

For me, as someone who loves the genre, that's actually a good thing. More of what i love, but presented better with more modern accessibility that reduces the tedium that comes with imitating old school games. These changes aren't something that any developer could have reasonably brought to the old game, it required the whole game being built again from scratch.  

As for comments about how long the game has been in development, my personal take is that I don't care how long a game takes to make so long as the final product is good.

In summary, I'm happy with the foundation Early Access has laid out for us to enjoy. Lets hope the remaining 45% yet to be added continues to distinguish Xenonauts 2 from it's predecessor. I'm looking forward to really sinking my teeth into it over the next few months as we move towards full release.

Noticed a few comments in reviews that are simply not true.  One I've seen 3 times already is that turns end with no warning when team members have points left.  That's simply not the case.
Left click on end turn does remind you of any of your team members with points left.
Right click ends turn regardless.

Not a single one of the quality-of-life updates that we asked for from the previous game was included, half the playtime is just loading screens, the dialogue is so sanitized that it makes a teen novel look eloquent, the assets are literally just slightly re-touched versions from the first game, the economy is absolutely busted, the base building is convoluted and counter intuitive, and the whole thing is wrapped up in layers upon layers of political propaganda. Purposefully misspelling Kiev, omitting Warsaw in the USSR, omitting Saigon and other highly political and economically influential cities. But all of that would be forgivable if not for the combat: We waited years for more weapons, drone surveillance systems, indirect fire systems, accurately weighted equipment, half decent operators, and even a decent line-of-sight and sight radius system for the player's troops. What we got was an amalgamation of recycled equipment, mechanics, and an EVEN WORSE troop management system. MIG-25s and CAR-15s in 2009? How could possibly have thought you would appeal to an audience of modern-tactical-shooter players with this lackluster content? Not to mention the hand-waving away of the content we actually wanted by simply saying ""iT dOeSnT MatTeR WuT tE XenONauTs UsE"". If it doesn't matter, why did you model the assets of other firearms? The damage system is completely busted: The 1.2 Pounds of Composition B inside a hand grenade creates and explosion that can rip apart CARS, and yet aliens and humans can face tank two of them. 40mm High Explosive Grenades have a kill radius of 10 meters. I know, I've used them personally. But ole Cleaner Joe Shmo can soak them up like you soaked up all the money that was supposed to go into developing an playable game, let alone an enjoyable one.

If you ever actually do decide to fire the special individuals that wrecked this project, I'd like you to keep in mind that the bare minimum that a basically trained US Marine can carry is their body weight. Your characters can hardly carry the shame of existing in this embarrassment of a video game. I would ask you to better if I thought you could.

Soldiers seem overall much stronger, I see a lot of reviews complaining about their soldiers being one shot by the aliens down range and through cover, I urge you to keep in mind that in 2 crouching costs 4 TUs and confers a defensive bonus, sit 1 tile behind a half cover object and throw smoke at the end of the turn.

If you do pick up this game, which I believe you should, try to ignore the reviews that are blaming any RNG or luck based plays and instead look to those that are honest with the current state of the game, the roadmap for this game is bright and you can always go back to Xenonauts 1 with X-Division if you ever want that long campaign to wait out the updates for 2. All in all this will be a great game, mod support will be coming as well buy while you can to take advantage of the sale and take it for a whirl, just remember that it is going to go by much quicker in the state that it is currently in but will be updated over the next 9 months.",1689729623,1689729623,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

One of the first computer games I played back in the 1990s was X-COM: UFO Defense. And X-COM: Terror From The Deep. I have great nostalgia for those games, and still play them every once in a while. And the whole genre (sci-fi strategic+turn-based tactical) is my cup of tea. The earlier remake XCOM: Enemy Unknown took the game in directions I didn't like. Enter Goldhawk and their Xenonauts game, which recreated the original games in a much, mucg closer spirit to the original. I played many hours of that as well. So when Xenonauts2 was announced on Kickstarter, I jumped on board.
I won't talk of the earlier builds and the development process. This build 1.20 on the day of release is in my opinion very playable. I have probably 20+ hours of game time in the past 2 weeks (primarily since milestone 1.12) and can see the changes happen very quickly. 

First of all, this isn't a game for everyone. There isn't much eye candy for the sake of eye candiness. I have seen other reviewere complain that it looks cartoonish. That is not the essence of the game though. The gameplay is however well thought out and balanced. No major gamestoppers that I have found or read about being present in the game's discord. Build your base(s). Recruit your soldiers. Build equipment. Shoot down UFOs. Respond to threats. Unravel the secrets of the Cleaners and of the Aliens. Build up for the final confrontation.

Yes the game has a rapidly climbing difficulty curve. It's not meant to be a walk in the park. I also play Dwarf Fortress, and remember from that: losing is FUN! :)

Is the game perfect? No. It's early access though, and day1 of it at that. I expect most if not all issues to be resolved. The developers are very responsive and I have seen problems getting corrected in a matter of hours. Nor do I agree in totality with all design and implementation decisions made in the game. For instance, the cover system is a bit... unfair. Also the AI cheats on higher difficulties - but then again, which AAA game doesn't have an AI that cheats on high difficulties? Live with it. 

I like the game, and the company behind it. And I highly recommend it. No, I have no ties to the company other than enjoying the products. I have not received the game for free (in fact I bought it twice: once on kickstarter/GOG as a backer, and today on day of launch on Steam as well).",1689709829,1689711586,True,2,0,0.531178712844848633,0,True,False,True

The roadmap is relatively short (9 months), and from reputation from their previous game I expect them to keep it around that.

+ New Tactical UI displays a lot of new info 
+ Smooth new animations are really nice, for actors and bullets too

+ New modules offer some loadout balances, if you want to give up grenades.

~ Soldiers seem to be ""Barley Troops"" aka finally have good stats (unless this is only for starting soldiers)
~ New art is alright. There's no (or verrrry minor) shading on anybody, so it still looks cheap and awkward
~ More generous vision, maybe, which if true is helpful (since we're just trying to have a nice tactical game of chess and not hide-and-seek). But I didn't get to night fighting in the refund window so unconfirmed.

- Carry weight balance is all over the place and really restrictive.
- Toolbelt is gone, for seemingly no reason since our backpacks are same or smaller.
- Armor penalizes accuracy: Lame.
- You can't directly aim the grenade launcher at a ground by clicking the picture, you must hit CTRL instead
- Knife is pointless because it's too heavy and large for something you won't really use
- The devs seem to have ignored the massive amounts of lovingly-crafted maps that modders added before; These maps seem messy and dull.
- The starting base is really messy. Get out of the way of my nice neat row of additional hangars!
- Base power supply is dumb as hell, in fact everything about basekeeping is more expensive.
- The ""Dynamic UFO health"" option is a symptom of the thoughtlessness of the devs. Why is that balance on me to decide? Just fix the balance in the game itself lol.
- Crouch TU cost increased by 1 because Fun?
- It seems REALLY HARD to suppress aliens with bullets now.
- The friendly/civilian AI is dumber than ever.

In Summary:
Actually a lot of this can be fixed in patches, so I would wait and look for the new content.

- The starting intro will blow your eardrums out. Before I started the game, I had the master volume at 25% and my ears are still ringing.
- The games visuals are absolutely nothing to write home about, but that's not really what we're here for. I'm not upset with them by any means.
- The Civilian AI is absolutely donkey-brained dumb. They have zero regard for their personal safety and will often place themselves perfectly between you and your alien target. Saving them seems to have little to do with your tactics and more if you're lucky. I get they may be panicked, or whatever lore you want to place here. But seems more like they just run in random directions vs. anything purposeful.
- This game punishes you if you try to rush into anything. You *must* be tactical (which again is kinda why most of us are buying this). You will need to be aware of unit stances (standing, crouching, prone), use grenades (smoke, flashbangs) to suppress and provide cover for your units. Be mindful of cover and the cover's durability as well. Even coming off the landing craft at times you'll need to drop smoke around it just to get off and to cover without aliens picking you off.
- You're probably going to lose units. If you're someone who gets attached to a specific one, this might not be the game for you.
- The customization on units is pretty deep. Can adjust really anything in their gear as long as they're strong enough to carry it all.
- After the tutorial, be prepared to read lots and lots of tooltips if you're not familiar with the game.
- Aliens often decide to shoot walls down and go through them vs. going around and using a door. Kinda annoying.

So, overall for an early access game I'd say its worth it if you're looking for a tactical battle and campaign simulator. I've enjoyed the bit I've played. My biggest gripe is really just the dumb civs.

EDIT:

As I've played a little longer, I wish I had a neutral option. I'm going to still recommend it if you're really a fan of this genre and you've just got nothing else on your plate. I feel like there's a ton of potential here, but honestly it just made me want to go back and download X-COM 2 until they bake some more stuff into this.

[b]A solid execution of the usual Turn Based Tactics + deep & intricate strategic and stat systems make this a great game for lovers of complex games! [/b]
https://youtu.be/JF6znkRBZ4I

TLDR in case you don't want to watch the video:
1. Despite a lofi appearance (and a very ‘Project Zomboid’ vibe) this game actually hides a pretty complex set of systems underneath

2.  ‘Time Units’,  which are a more nuanced version of action points, interact with Strength, Reflexes, Carry Weight, Loadout, Morale, Bravery, Mental Strength… etc. etc. the list goes on

3. It can get very overwhelming and complex, especially for players new to the genre - but helpful tool tips and tutorials slowly but surely introduce these complex systems to you. The AI is pretty brutal, and some RNG luck factors into mission success - but this is intended, as stated by the characters in the game, and losing missions and soldiers, thankfully, isn't usually an immediate game over.

4. The strategic layer, while seemingly shallow at first, opens up to add onto the complexity with base building, hidden enemy locations, and trying to guess where and when the enemy will strike. The air / UFO battles are also surprisingly interesting to say the least. Research and engineering also add more complexity and number crunching!

5. Be warned; this game is in early access, and parts of the campaign are still not done 

I wish this had a complete campaign because everything else felt great! The devs have sort of mentioned a timeline of 9-12 months. Nonetheless, if you are a turn based tactics or X-Com fan, wishlist it now and buy it when it goes 1.0 - or just try it out now if you’re craving for some action!",1689689473,1689694823,True,3,1,0.491949915885925293,0,True,False,True

First of all, the good:
- I enjoy being able to rotate the camera and the new visual style
- Animations are way smoother, I like
- Visual fidelity overall seems to be much improved. I guess you can like this or not, I like it
- More fleshed out early game it seems. More items, more research, more base buildings (including adjacency bonuses)
- Aerial combat OST is an absolute BANGER

The ""okay"" stuff:
- new aerial combat is...weird. However the game states so itself. So I guess aerial combat will be fleshed out during early access. As of now: Tailing a target is useless because your planes end up in front of it either way (= bad)


The bad stuff:
- sound design feels honestly like a enormous downgrade. Weapon sounds are downright disappointing and overall the sound designs lacks ""oomph"", if you catch my drift. Hopefully this is just placeholder audio and the good stuff is coming soon because it's really not great
- Game is quite ... stuttery? during enemy turns
- I think animation windup during reaction shots of the Xenonauts is a little too fast. I feel like I barely get time to see which one of my soldiers even shot because the shot is already starting, sometimes when the camera is still panning to my soldier


Overall it's a recommend. I adored the first Xenonaut and I'm sure Goldhawk will fix this up to be a great product down the line. Early Access is supposed to last roughly 9 months, so that's not too bad.",1689683625,1689683625,True,3,0,0.534607052803039551,0,True,False,True

So happy they have finally released this onto early access. Loving the game so far, a few tweaks here and there and it will be an excellent/perfect game. 

The game can defiantly be very frustrating at times, due to the difficulty and randomness; the save scummer in me always wins the battle, but the tactical and strategic game-play is outstanding, no crashes so far, performance is a lot better than the betas, loading times are still a little long for me, as you can see above ;) 

You get this feeling while you are playing that you know you should wait for full release before playing as the game takes many hours of careful planning and commitment and knowing that there is more content to come, but you just cannot help but keep advancing your tech, then finding more powerful enemies and saying one more, then another, it is an addictive game.

This second Xenonauts installment is an Early Access which is not a really bad thing as I am confident the devs will improve on the game over time.

I like the equipment, the ability to locate our base all over the world (it's always nice to pick the exact spot you want as opposed to having an entire sector, it's the little things!), a decent tutorial with nested tooltips (if you don't know what's that it's a tooltip inside of a tooltip, similar to what Crusader Kings 3 brought and it's really helpful!), soundtrack is okay, but not to mesmerizing, there's no VO, combat has some depth which I like and there's the ability to destroy most of the environment. Not a big fan of the current UI, but I will get used to it, this one has that old-school Grand-Strategy vibe, but to each their own.

Haven't played a lot, but if you are okay with this being more of an old-school game rather than the AAA quality that X-Com provides (don't hate me devs, but I can't wait for X-Com 3!), then you should enjoy this one. Please remember it's Early Access, so there's bound to be bugs and glitches.
