The player is presented with a plethora of options when it comes to which vegetation they would like to grow; and which slimes they wish to corral. It’s not the biggest game out there but it’s a good balance of quality over quantity. As if it was longer, I fear grinding would sap the fun out of it. My only recommendation for this game would be to pay attention to the story line, as it will pleasantly surprise you. I was mindlessly playing through this game without reading anything.

Gameplay loop is torn between either being jailed to your seven plots in your ranch or you explore the mundane same-y world. Being stuck in your farm is much more profitable but maddening.
If you constantly explore, it can get quite boring after a few hours - and the exploration isn't really worth it?

Character's aren't interesting since you only talk to screens. Gameplay loop is wonderful for the early game (like first 5 hours). Missions are a chore and have pisspoor rewards. This game is not that challenging, nor it has that rewarding midgame or endgame depth and consistency. Everything feels shallow and repetitive. You're not really being given a reason to ""work"", it's that you're bored and have nothing to do, so you painstakingly give yourself mundane shallow tasks to keep you occupied, because the game's foundations are not that thought out.

You build a slime ranch with gardens, chickens, and a bunch of different slimes, but no one ever stops to tell you why you're doing this. Make a bunch of money, but again there's no real reason to do that. There's no storyline except some messages dotting the land from the guy who owned the farm before you, but his story doesn't serve any real purpose, either. You get some emails, but they're barely worth reading.

So you go out and explore because there are places to go, and you find new slimes and things to take home, but there's never any point to any of it except that it's there to do. I don't need some grand story or much to go on, really, but I just kept waiting for some sort of thing to happen and it never did. If ""Slime Ranching"" is what you want to do, you can amass enough slimes from just outside your farm to create an incredibly lucrative farm.

Also, upgrades to your farm and your equipment seem to appear at predetermined times, so there's not even that to look forward to because there's no way to know if you're going to get a useful new upgrade or just another bit of HP that you don't need because this game is clearly for children and nothing will challenge your health at all.

This game has never failed to cheer me up when I'm feeling down, its a fun experience for anyone interested in ranching, and slimes. go figure. i recommend to anyone looking for a fun game, an adorable story, a peaceful soundtrack and really gorgeous, simplistic visuals.

the characters are fun and the designs are great, i love the personality and dynamics each character has. The story is awesome, its very cute and its fun to go through it as you explore the Far, Far Range. Last but not least, the stars of the show, the slimes! the designs are so good. each slime combination is very different from the last, and they all have their pros and cons, which i love. its also fun to go through each and every combination there is, and the environments you have to travel through to find each different slime are all really beautiful and full of life. 

in short, I love this game. there's a lot i haven't mentioned here but i think its worth buying the game and exploring for yourself. or, if you'd rather stay up to date, Slime Rancher 2 was released recently, and that's a blast too. (you don't have to play 1 to understand 2, but i recommend it, you'd miss out on a lot of story otherwise!)

Slimes, plump and mischievous, bounce like lost souls seeking redemption. Their eyes, wide as the abyss, hold secrets and dreams. The grass sways, whispering forgotten hymns to the wind. Truly, it is a sight to behold, worthy of a thousand sunrises.

Picture this, brave Ashen One: You, clad in your VacPack armor, venturing into the wilds to capture these gelatinous marvels. Each slime, a tiny universe of quirks and desires. Some crave fruit, others crave meat, and a few harbor secrets that could unravel the very fabric of reality. Forge bonds with them, feed them, and witness their metamorphosis. It’s like kindling a bonfire in your heart.

Hidden caves, ancient ruins, and mysterious artifacts await your curious gaze. The Far Far Range is a tapestry of whimsy, stitched together by cosmic threads. Seek out the elusive Gilded Ginger, a delicacy coveted by slimes and gods alike. Unravel the enigma of ancient statues, their eyes following your every move. And when the sun sets, watch the phosphorescent slimes dance, their glow echoing forgotten prophecies.

Like shards of Estus, upgrades beckon you. Expand your ranch, build silos, and unlock gadgets that defy reason. Jetpacks, teleporters, and music boxes – all at your disposal. Customize your home, paint it with memories, and let the echoes of your deeds resonate through the ages. For every plort you sell, a piece of your legacy unfurls.

Game Play 1.5/2
Slime Rancher has a tycoon style game play where you can explore the world while your farm semi passively generates income, and your exploration efforts + farm optimization directly correlate with the amount of money you make. It's a fun game play loop, with good risk and reward. For example, you can house many slimes on your farm, but the more mouths you have to feed the harder it is to manage them. Or you could place two different types of largo slimes right next to each other for compactness, but it risks them turning into tarr. There are also optional challenges you can perform that will grant you extra rewards and more space to put slimes. 
Not one person's farm will look the same, especially with all the decoration you can place around. However, decoration isn't easy to come by, and the main game play loop is held back by two things. Players that enjoy exploring will find it difficult to make money since they're not tending to the slimes at the farm, and you need money to buy personal upgrades that make exploring easier. Players that enjoy farming will not be able to access the rarer slimes in hard to reach parts of the world. For some this sounds like a good thing, requiring players to perform both tasks for the full experience. But it is impossible to multitask between these two, unless there was some sort of drone that could assist players by automating tasks. 
If you unlock the lab and interact with the refinery, the game gains an additional layer of factory style game play. Drones are the primary gizmo that players want to focus on, being able to perform simple tasks in the player's stead. However for the game to not immediately break after getting drones, you must water them occasionally to keep them going. I tried figuring out how to automatically water the drones, but it's not possible. They are still useful, but there was a missed opportunity. The gizmos do not add enough depth for players that enjoy optimizing automation, and for players that just want to farm, they completely remove any motivation or reason to do so. Making money becomes as simple as going to sleep, watering your drones, and repeating. So I believe that Slime Rancher's strongest game play comes from the mid game, when you're discovering new slimes and buying new upgrades. 

Story 1.3/2 
Slime Rancher's story all comes from emails, notes left behind a previous rancher, and interacting with the characters that give you special missions. All of the story is completely optional (except for Casey's emails) and well paced. It also encourages more exploration, and I believe has a good moral. My only critique is that some of the characters are one note, and the agency you have to affect the story boils down to ""you either do the story or you don't."" 

Graphics 1.4/2
This game has a 3D cartoony art style which completely fits the game's tone, and the slimes all look adorable. However, because of how often textures get reused in the game, some of the areas start to look samey. You can only really tell the difference if you know the area's geometry. The lighting isn't bad either, but nothing revolutionary. At least I didn't encounter any visual bugs.

Music 2/2
This soundtrack is beautiful, and widely varied. It gives the vibes of driving a pickup truck down a long lonely road, which matches the game's lonely yet adventurous tone. I have this game's songs in my Spotify play lists, and I feel nostalgic when I listen to them. My favorite song is Ancient Ruins because it perfectly encapsulates the mystery of the world, it feels like I only just started playing the game after unlocking the area. 

Price 1/2
For $20, this game is just right. However the play time can be quite short depending on your engagement with the game, and I feel it has hardly any replay ability, even with the rush mode. I also bought the secret style pack DLC for $8. It just adds variant skins for the slimes, something a mod could've done. It's more something you would buy if you wanted to support the developers.",1707603554,1707603867,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Slime Rancher is a pretty fun game to hop on every now and then to improve your slime ranch. Theres a lot of different types of slimes and slime combinations, and you can customize your ranch to look after the specific slimes you want.

[b] What is Slime Rancher? [/b]

I have been playing this game for a few years now, even though the hours don't have to show for it. This is a adorable game about a person who enjoys exploring and have come to a planet that seems to have a load of friendly little slime creatures. They are the smaller slimes, which have individual names and then there are the bigger slimes which are two slimes combined together which are called ""largos"" and then the biggest slimes which are called ""Gordos"". You can capture slimes and put them into pens to collect their plorts (poo) and sell it for money. You can also grow and harvest crops as well as farm chickens. You have to be careful though because something called tar can spawn and reek havoc on your world.

[b] Initial Thoughts: [/b]

-""This game is adorable.""
-""Honey slimes are my favourite."" 
-""HONEY LARGO CULT HONEY LARGO CULT HONEY LARGO CULT.""

(No honey largos or slimes were hurt in the game or the making of this comment)

[b] Beginner Player Friendly?  [/b]

This game isn't to complicated. It can be a little confusing at first and the puzzles that are in the game can be a little confusing however its nothing to hard to figure out. So I would say this game is beginner player friendly. The key binds are super simple as well and it is controller compatible. 

[b] Game Play: [/b]

The game play itself is very entertaining. You get to be in first person. The game is not multiplayer but honestly I think this game would be so cool with a multiplayer mode. This game does have a story, though you could go through and play the whole game without the story itself. (it wont impact your decisions or any of your game play if you do not acknowledge the story.) There is a few different game modes 
though, there are a few other 'speed run' game modes which can help out with a challenge to get as much money as possible in a short period of time. You have a lot of upgrades which you can do for the objects, the pens and the farms. You can also use items to upgrade your worlds and make tools.

There is a VR mode for anyone who is interested in that. I have not played much of it but its so so cute. 

[b] Graphics: [/b]

The graphics are simple and cartoon like. I don't think they could have done better with these graphics as it matches their game very well. The slimes also react and interact very well with the environment around them. It makes the game feel more life like in a way. However life like slimes with smiley faces can be. I feel like they could have done a little more with whatever is happening beyond the water and sea, but its not important to the game. This game can run on very low end computers. It also is available on console for those of you who would rather play from the comfort of your own bed. 

[b] Community: [/b]

The community for this game is very friendly so do not be afraid to ask questions about anything you may be struggling with. 

[b] How long can you play? [/b]

This game's story will take upwards to hours. If you are a speed runner you could probably finish most if not all of it within 2 hours. You can realistically play this for as long as you want, but for me once I have finished pretty much everything it was game over. 

[b] My Opinion: [/b]

I think this game is a really fun and cute comfy cosy game for anyone looking for a relaxing good time. The objectives are simple and you don't have to think too too much (which sometimes is what we need)

Stage 1). Exploration: When starting a new slime rancher playthrough the player will be given a very basic tutorial via pop up prompts instructing the player on how to move and use the basic abilities of the character. (The player is not required to complete this tutorial before venturing out into the world beyond the safety of the ranch.) Once the player has completed all tutorial tasks they are encouraged to explore the world to collect resources and Slimes to bring back to the ranch and begin the core of the game. Slimes can be corralled and fed to produce “plort” which can be sold for profit at the market allowing the player to upgrade themselves and the ranch to further increase financial gain. During this time the player is at very minimal risk as they only have access to one area of the map and 3 types of slimes with a fourth only being available during the night cycle. While this initial phase of the game is magical during a first time run of the game it can be tedious for future playthroughs as there is little that can be done to expedite early progression.

Stage 2). Expansion: At this point in the game the player has unlocked new regions of the map, new slimes breeds, new areas of the ranch and has experimented with hybrid slime breeds or “Largos” as the game refers to them. It is during this stage of the game in which the player faces the greatest amount of danger as they encounter new more dangerous and profitable slime breeds as well as more treacherous terrain. While experimenting with Largos the player will also likely encounter “Tarr” which are a breed of slimes that produce no plort, consume other nearby slimes and actively seek out and attack the player. Tarr are created if a hybrid slime is crossed with a third breed of slime and pose an immediate threat to both the player’s health and profit. This stage of the game will take up a majority of any given playthrough and will also demand the most of a player in terms of managing the ranch forcing the player to do less and less exploring.

Stage 3). Automation: The ultimate goal of any good management game is to make a factory that completes objectives for you and slime rancher does not miss this mark. After unlocking the laboratory section of the ranch, he is introduced to “Slime Science” giving the player an entirely new way to interact with the world. Specifically the drone gadget gives the player a great deal of freedom to explore the world and find hidden secrets as it can be programmed to do all rancher tasks and only needs an occasional refueling. This reopening of the world is great but it suffers from the fact that most of the exploration type players will have already been burnt out by the management phase of the game.

Stage 4). Postgame and Extras: While there are 3 main stages of the game there is also an entire set of extra areas that are completely unrelated to the main world map and story. The player can enter these areas the moment they unlock the corresponding sections of the ranch but since the gameplay of these areas is so wildly different from the base game and the needs of the ranch do still occur while you are in these areas it’s highly recommended you wait until you have some automation before going to these areas. The extra sections of the map, while a fun break from the standard gameplay loop, really offer very little other than an extension to the ranch and a minigame. Only one of the three bonus areas actually introduces a new type of slime that you can bring to the ranch and even then you can only bring back hybrids so if you are a collector type player you won’t actually be able to display the new slime type.

Overall Slime Rancher is a great game that I highly recommend to both explorer and manager players with only minor setbacks to fun in the second half of the game.

TL:DR run around and sell gooey poop until you get bored.

- Even though it has a sprint button, it's not like some games with a sprint button where whenever you're walking it feels painful
- The art style is very unique and just radiates positivity
- It feels like upgrading your stuff is improving your life, unlike some idle games where it'll feel like you're just doing things because what else is there to do
- The exploration and management aspects of the game are really well balanced with each other
- I personally wouldn't say it's worth 20$ because I don't think I'm gonna put a ton of time into this game, but if you're the kind of person who can grind out idle games for hours on end, I'd definitely say it's worth the price

The gameplay primarily revolves around simple tasks: collecting slimes, feeding them, and harvesting their poo for sale. It sounds absurd, right? That's because it is. The earned currency allows players to unlock minor quality-of-life upgrades, such as autofeeders, collectors, teleporters, and purely cosmetic items, all aimed at facilitating the continuous cycle of slime collection and poo selling. There was a real missed opportunity to introduce complexity in the slime management aspect of the game, through management of their personalities and behaviours, but each of the slimes act in the same manner: jumping, attacking, hungry. 

The game's narrative, or lack thereof, is delivered through poorly written emails and scattered notes throughout the world. Progression is hindered by locked biomes, requiring players to feed large slimes significant amounts of veggies, fruit, or meat to obtain keys to unlock doors—an unnecessary impediment to advancement. The additional biomes lack substantial visual variety, typically differing only in color palette and vegetation.

Navigating the environment proves cumbersome, with the game introducing significant verticality. While an upgradeable jetpack is meant to aid movement, its power is limited and feels as though it's powered by slime farts. Players will find themselves expending a substantial portion of energy just to hover a few feet above the ground, creating frustration rather than assistance.

Ultimately, Slime Rancher offers a grinding experience with little payoff. The cycle of collecting slimes and selling resources persists without significant narrative or gameplay advancements, leaving players with the ongoing prospect of more grind without substantial rewards.",1706893714,1706893714,False,3,0,0.491104573011398315,0,True,False,False

Slime Rancher is a almost perfectly sized game that has one of the most perfect playthrough lengths that I've ever seen. If this is your first video game ever, it's probably one of the best singelplayer games to pick. [/h1]

[b] Actual Review (Censored Spoilers): [/b] This is one of those games that you have the itch to fire up again every few years for a new playthrough, and every time you get to rediscover things you've forgotten. I played this way back on release but never finished it, and coming back over 5 years later was a delight. This is probably the most relaxing game I've ever played. You literally can just turn your brain off completely and farm. Setting up plots of land, adventuring through the wild and collecting slimes and resources to bring back, and there is even a lot of content you can choose to engage with or not, so you can tailor your playthrough as you see fit. The range exchange for example lets you open up three entire areas that aren't part of the main story and aren't needed unless you want to ramp up your ranch. Overall this game has lots of charm that never really gets old. The SINGULAR complaint that I have is the fact there is no co-op and is strictly a singleplayer experience. This game would be near perfect if it was 2 player.

There is a surprisingly good story and range of characters to interact with here. The devs made the smart decision of letting the story take the backseat and letting you discover things yourself through environmental storytelling and hidden letters. [spoiler] I will admit the ending few pieces of story and the actual ending are very abrupt, but that's really the only negative thing about it. The story itself is super interesting throughout the whole game. [/spoiler]

The gameplay is the main focus of the game. And it's a pretty simple but solid loop. Collect resources while you explore, deposit, configure/manage your ranch, repeat. There are a lot of upgradable items and tools as well as unlockable color palettes for your gear and ranch. There are also tons of treasure pods to find ranging from obvious to VERY well hidden, especially in the later areas you unlock. Thankfully they are very much worth the trouble of finding as some of them contain powerful item blueprints.

This game also has some REALLY fitting music that never gets boring to listen to. There are time of day variations of each area as well. The artstyle is also a really big plus but that's pretty evident enough.

Lastly the achievement grind wasn't bad either. There are no truly grindy achievements and the rush mode achievements aren't hard either if you have a gameplan going into it. I got all three done first try. Also I'm happy to report that most of the achievements that didn't come from playing naturally were actually fun to do, which is pretty rare!

Definitely recommend this game. One of the best to get into video games if you're new to gaming, or if you're just looking for a stress reliever. And even with no co-op, it's never not a fun time. 9/10",1696308613,1706667288,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only things that prevent this game from being *perfect*, in my opinion, are the following (minor) issues:

-I wish there were map markers for slime gates, treasure pods, two-way teleporters, and Gordos when you first encounter them, or at least a way to put down custom map markers yourself. I have a bad memory, and kept forgetting where things were.

-Hen coops & Onion patches are not reliable sources of foods, almost forcing you to make Largos, which feels bad.

-Felt that the 3 extra ranches were a bit complicated, but that might just be a me-problem.

Otherwise the game is as good as it gets! Highly recommend!",1706556111,1706556111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

Hra je vizuálně velmi příjemná a barevná. Grafika je krásná a také kreslený styl dodává hře určitý šarm. Každý sliz je odlišně vyvedený a je radost je pozorovat. Zvuková stránka hry je také perfektní a příjemná na ucho. 

Jedním z nejzábavnějších aspektů hry je explorace. Slime Rancher vás nechává objevovat rozsáhlý svět a objevovat nové druhy slizů a předmětů. Každý druh slizu má své jedinečné vlastnosti a reakce, což zpříjemňuje hru a přidává jí na dlouhodobější hratelnosti.

Hra má také dobře navržený systém upgradeů a vylepšení. Postupně budete sbírat peníze a zkušenosti, které můžete investovat do lepšího vybavení či zdokonalování farmy. To je důležité, protože vás to motivuje ke zlepšování a zdokonalování ve hře.

Jedinou možnou nevýhodou hry je, že se může zdát příliš repetitivní. Po určitém čase může chování slizů a farmování začít trochu nudit. Nicméně přidání nových druhů slizů a aktualizací hry tuto potenciální nedostatečnost vyrovnává.

Celkově je Slime Rancher skvělá hra, kterou si užijí jak milovníci farmářských her, tak i casual hráči. Krásná vizuální stránka, zábavná hratelnost a nabídka upgradeů vás potěší na dlouhé hodiny.",1705827076,1705827076,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's simple but has absolutely beautiful lore and scenery if you dig deep enough, parts of it makes you think and other parts can make you feel many different things. I enjoy a lot of the designs of the slimes and the scenery and although the places can get confusing, it's nice to fall into the rythmn of just exploring with no destination in mind or just getting lost in the Glass Desert and not using the map to get out-

Overall, it's a lovely experience to unwind with and the achievements are quite fun to try and get, slowly working through them. Personally, I've been mostly playing on the adventure/casual mode but the other modes seem fun as well and I can't wait to try out Rush mode <3

So, not typically one for cutesy stuff and games, I usually play dark and grim story games or horror games or games where you're either killing people or creatures, and this game is literally none of that but I still had a fantastic time playing it. It actually became addicting to me, wanting to house every slime on my ranch and get all of the combinations possible, I enjoyed playing this even as simple as it is. Get slime, feed slime, sell plort, repeat. A simple gameplay loop, and yet, there was a ton of stuff to do and I loved it. It was nice to sit back and relax while playing instead of my other action filled games.

I will say, once you get to endgame it does feel a bit empty and repetitive. I don't exactly remember what I was trying to achieve at the end cause I'm writing this review about 3 or more years later, possibly 4, but I remember there is a place called the Glass Desert and there was something you had to do there and I just... got tired of it because it was insanely repetitive or difficult to do. It may have been for an achievement or something, as I said, don't remember, so maybe it wasn't something you even had to do. Anyway, this is a cute and fun game and I liked listening to music while playing. I even went ahead and 100%-ed it recently too (which was a little difficult but I managed).

So if you're looking for a relaxing game to play while also getting away from all the other action-filled, killing games, then play Slime Rancher, but I do suggest you go look at the newer one because this one isn't being updated anymore and is a bit outdated now. 7.5/10.",1600560557,1705767789,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I've wanted this game for almost 7 years, having watched every play through I could get my hands on as a kid. It was genuinely so up my alley as a 12 year old, I knew I needed to get it once I was reminded of it's existence late last year. I played it for about 20~ hours initially, moved, and finally finished it at around 45~ hours. It has a great game play loop, lots of replay value through things like rush mode and the multitude of mini games it provides, and is a great game to either multitask to or just let your mind go to ease. I've had awesome nights staying up late with friends and talking while playing, and I've also had really good afternoons putting in an hour or two. The slime designs are adorable, and trying to maximize plort value in market by manipulating slime combinations was genuinely entertaining. I was just gifted the second game, and cannot wait to play and see where the dev team goes with it! 10/10 game!!",1705702481,1705702481,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spoiler-ish:

I've found it takes a while to get some quality of life upgrades and it's much closer to something like stardew valley in terms of progression. The story line is so fucking stellar that when I hit end-game and read the FINAL note (which I had not read literally any of because I'd be skipping them) I immediately went back and read them all and cried. I'm now onto slime rancher 2 which is also stellar but way more grind-y. I've got quite a few hours on both games and I really enjoy them, but I do take extended breaks between grind sessions because I get so annoyed the next section hasn't unlocked yet. I'm also a mild completionist so that adds another level of frustration because I don't use walkthroughs. My only suggestion is get to the tallest spot on any section of the map and you will find hidden shit. 

Overall, I adore this game. I just got back into slime rancher 2 a few days ago and I fell back in love. I suggest this to anyone who enjoys chill farming and squishy buddies!

LASTLY: USE. THE. BEES. And don't forget to splash them with water to wake them up. You can't run a farm on your own ya know!",1705613720,1705613720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Slime Rancher is a first person exploration-platformer game suitable for kids or tired adults, with some light farming mechanics. At its heart is a goofy ecosystem-regulation mechanic where slimes can grow and merge their attributes together by eating each other's poop, but if a fully grown slime eats another kind of poop, it mutates into a Tarr monster that eats other slimes. In this way, environments regulate themselves from getting overpopulated by too many different slimes, and you're encouraged to keep high value slimes on your farm in their own pens for safety.

A large portion of the game is simply solid first person platforming. The world is built with satisfying loops and winding pathways,and as you level up your jetpack you can discover shortcuts over mountain ridges and secrets nestled in the world geometry. As you upgrade your farm, you also unlock new shortcuts and areas that establish your farm as a seamless part of the world with plenty of its own potential to unlock.

At its heart, Slime Rancher is about exploration. Despite this sim aspects, it's pretty unlikely that you'll lose any serious progress in this game, though the post-game Rush mode is a legitimate challenge to your comprehension of the world and its mechanics. There's a light story that gently guides you through the game's various environments, but because of how grind-heavy the game's story mode can be, it's not particularly well-suited for replaying. That said, a complete save file is a fine little sandbox, and if you like setting your own goals or achievement hunting there's enough to keep you coming back here and there.

Over the years this has become one of my most returned-to games on Steam just for the low-stress, holistic, and mischievous little world Monomi Park has created. Despite its humble looks, Slime Rancher is the full package, and has set quite a high bar for its sequel.",1489955664,1704954051,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story, although very fun, with character arcs you can really get invested in, feels like it was an afterthought sometimes. There are a small cast of characters, who all have an arc that the player gets to go through and help influence. Mochi, Hugo, Victor, among others. Casey, or anyone else, all characters in the story. However, the characters can sometimes feel like they get overshadowed by the ranching experience, which I feel is just fine, actually. Although I would wish for more time to talk to your love interest on earth, or your new friends across the universe, the time you get in incredible and precious.The gameplay is great. The ranching experience, taking care of adorable slimes that love to see you, the exploration of the massive and beautiful world, with new creatures and lore to find, and things to do in every moment, no matter when you think you're done. Hell, even if you don't enjoy either aspect of that, there is so much you can do outside of that. Reading letters, or going through a small visual novel through the characters, and finding more with fun mini-games, or, even if you don't find joy in those things or concepts, you can plan, space out slimes and machines, and plan it out to be so incredibly efficient, that you can relax and just play with silly slimes. You can even play with the games market, saving your plorts, or selling them to make the most money.

Overall, if you enjoy story that involves you, gameplay that includes exploration and planning, and just adorable creatures and beautiful worlds, I'd try the game.",1615684122,1704588447,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is simple, sweet, and oddly charming; albeit, tedious at times. I would say there isn't much endgame content other than achievements, but what you do get is great. The lack of endgame is forgivable for how long one can invest hours upon hours into this game.

As for 100%, there is no ""real 100%"" other than the story and achievements. One could theoretically play this game forever. So, Obviously, I have all the achievements and the story is complete. I went a few steps further to get all the locations, all the unlocks, all the recipes, all the treasure pods, upgrades, 7Zee rewards club tiers, a farm that is able to produce every farm-able type of slime automatically, and having crafted everything at least once. Needless to say, I covered every base of this game, even if I didn't get an achievement for it. As for the ""Adventure mode"" achievements, they're all doable. Might have to look a few things up from time to time, but yes, very possible.

As for the ""Rush Mode"" achievements; I recommend you 100% the ""Adventure Mode."" Having a knowledge of the layout will help ALOT in ""Rush Mode."" I was able to get all three achievements for ""Rush Mode"" in one go, but, keep in mind, I probably played this game WAY longer than most would. I had some help from guides, and I was able to get everything done right away, and thus, 100%'ed the game. I recommend this mode last, as it is the most stressful thing in this entire game, where every second of time is more precious than any resource available. 

For a casual players, probably a solid 8/10. (Reason: There is no end-game content besides achievements and/or maxing out your farm like I did.)

For the 100-er's: 10/10: (You will always find something to upgrade, make better, or whatever.) (Not too impossible, and not too stress inducing if you have the knowledge and skill.)

As or me, a solid 10/10. Worth every dollar. (Not penny, b/c change crisis)",1510545493,1704574834,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

But I am enjoying Slime Rancher on creative mode, with no enemies and a ""rest"" period penalty for almost killing yourself rather than a ""game over'.  Yeah, you lose your stuff but better than reloading a save.
The little slimes, with their happy faces and ""wheeeeee's"" as you hurl them around just make me smile.  I've never seen anybody look so happy to be shot into cages and walls and off cliffs in my life.
I do wish the upgrades you buy in the house for fences and walkways were more obvious and you could pick and choose.  Seems so far that you have to buy upgrades in the order they come up to get to the good stuff.
And I wish the chickens weren't so cute.  I feel bad when I feed them to the slimes.

Years later, I returned to 100% the game... And in doing so, I had the joy of experiencing all that Slime Rancher has to offer. I had jumped into the game believing it would be a quick shot to the end, but as time had passed the game went from silly fun to taking care of my slimes with all that I could. I was locked into the game with such an immersion that I felt a great connection to the slimes I had in my ranch that I kept through the entire game. Almost all of the experience is unpredictable- leading to all sorts of surprises that kept me from losing that immersion. Brimming with love and care in every aspect, it is the simplicity of it that makes it so charming. There is so little if anything to dislike about this game.

I remembered trying the sequel on console a few years back, and remembered playing the game a lot when I was younger, around 2017-2018. Having fond memories of the game when it was in its earlier stages, and seeing my lackluster achievements, I decided to give it another shot. Now, a couple days later, 50 more hours in the game, and with every single achievement unlocked. I can tell you, with confidence, that this game, is amazing! And to be honest, i feel as though I've done the game a disservice by having such a great experience collecting dust in my library for so long. Please, PLEASE give this game another shot if you've over looked it in the past. The game is extremely cute, relaxing, and even has a very heartfelt and, almost tragic story aswell between the Beatrix LeBeau and her lover that she left on earth. Once again, please play this game and i promise you will not regret it.",1704004032,1704004032,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When you get a good amount of money, you get the chance to upgrade your ranch, vacpack, etc. I personally love this game from the lovely graphics, adorable characters, and free will to do anything and go anywhere on the map! along with the different types of gameplay you can choose (casual, adventure and rush), along with the theme and looks for me creates an outstanding game.

If you love exploration, chill gameplay, and most importantly, adorable creatures; i think you'll find this game will suit you well. The diversity of all the areas and everything in them are so nice to look at, sometimes I find myself visiting the glass desert to just look at the stars and that endless, sandy sea. They also somehow made a game with more types of slime than Terraria. But my final point, the puddle slime. You need no further explanation, look it up and you will understand. What i'm saying is the game is good, so if you're thinking of buying it, go for it, take it from me. Meanwhile, im off to play Slime Rancher 2.

slime rancher, developed & published by monomi park, is a charming and unique life simulation game that invites players to explore the whimsical world of the ""far, far range"" where you capture, cultivate, and nurture a plethora of different creatures of different variants known as slimes.

the gameplay is the heart and soul of its core appeal. the mechanics are responsive and intuitive, and the main gameplay loop involves exploring the far, far range, capturing different slime, and then managing your ranch. there's even more hardcore mechanics that are done especially well here such as a day/night cycle, a weather system, creating a dynamic ecosystem that keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging throughout the entire journey to 100% completion.

visually, there's a vibrant and appealing art style. slimes have distinctive designs and environments are also colorful and immersive. the game strikes a perfect balance between simplicity and complexity, ensuring that players can easily distinguish between different elements while enjoying a visually pleasing experience. you might get some frame drops but they are extremely minor and extremely uncommon, so they don't detract from the overall enjoyment at all.

there's satisfying sound effects all over the game, whether it's the slimes bouncing around or the sound when you suck up resources, overall the audio design is great. the one drawback/negative i can point out is that the music, while charming and pleasing to listen to, can become repetitive over longer sessions.

there is a staggering amount of content for completionists specifically. from collecting every type of slime and resource to unlocking secret areas and discovering hidden treasures, the game consistently rewards exploration and dedication. the addition of numerous achievements and challenges provides a clear and concise roadmap for players striving for 100% completion, ensuring a sense of accomplishment with each milestone achieved.

the post-launch support from monomi park has been exemplary, with frequent updates introducing new content, slimes, and features. this ongoing support adds longevity to the game, encouraging players to return and experience fresh challenges.

there's a exceptionally high replay value here as well. no two playthroughs are exactly alike and even after achieving 100% completion you could continue playing the game, as you could try different strategies, create new challenges for yourself, or just simply enjoy the world crafted by the devs. 

slime rancher is a delightful and captivating little experience that excels in gameplay, graphics, and content. its accessible mechanics make it enjoyable for players of all ages, while the depth and complexity of its systems provide a rewarding experience for those seeking 100% completion. the undeniable charm on display here makes slime rancher a must-play title and achieving100% completion is a satisfying journey through a whimsical world.",1703730179,1703730179,True,6,0,0.578606963157653809,0,True,False,False

Taking place on a very distant planet, Beatrix LeBeau, our protagonist, must make her mark on this alien world. Taking over the ranch from an old Slime farmer to return it to its former glory.

- Fun, unique environments Each area is very distinct from the last. Having its own aesthetics, slime, and food to observe and collect.
- Your weapon is a vacuum! Use it to collect more than 16 different slime types to take back to your ranch and corral!
- Feed and combine slimes to produce a variety of 'plorts' that can be exchanged on the market for 'Newbucks' the in-game currency.
- Build up the ranch your way with several unique buildings including corrals, gardens, silos, teleportation portals, and plenty of decorations and color schemes to make it your own! 
- Upgrade your character with a better Vacpak Gun, jetpack, dash boots, and more!
- Three different modes to choose from, including a time trial style for an added challenge. 

- While the story does conclude, there is no end to the game itself. You are free to continue for as long as you would like to customize, grow, and challenging yourself. While this might appeal to some players, this isn't really for me. 
- The actual ""farming/ranching"" part of the game did lose its appeal and became very mundane after some time. While this is the game at its core, with such an interesting world to explore and little secrets to find, I found myself actually neglecting the ranch itself until I ran out of funds and needed to replenish.

Over all, the game was quite a bit of fun. It is a nice distraction from some of the more serious titles that many people might be playing. Even if it's only a pick up for a little here and there, it's fun to just explore a positive world every once in a while!

+ Slime's are so cute.

- It can get repetitive and tedious
- Helping drones become necessity at the endgame because you won't be able to catch up in taking care of all the slimes.

This game is good for when you just want to wind up and relax. With its cute graphics and even cutest slimes, you can work on your farm and slowly discover more and more of the slime world. Almost all gates that you open with the slime keys has areas to discover with new slimes that you can colect and bring back to your farm. The possibility to make the slimes large makes it makes for strategy. What slimes do you combine? What food will you feed them with? With each slime having abilities that makes them easier or harder to contain it is fun to figure out how to care of your slimes in you farm. Together with the unique looks for each slime you can see that there was care put into this game.

There is lot to do, from helping the other farmers with their quests like collecting fruit, racing and collecting silver plorts or trying to find the impostor glitch slimes which is great break from the repetivness of taking care of your slime.

The crafting system also makes it easier to take care of the slimes in the end. One thing that I didn't like but it mostly my thing is the fact that at the end the drones are necessity rather than easy acessibility as taking care of all your slimes will take all the time that you won't be able to really wander off to other ranches. However the recipe for drones is quite expensive that it takes a while before you can craft your first drone.

This can make mid game and end game difficult.

Still. I would recommend to try this game.




This game is good for just winding up, turn the brain off and relax. 

I love the progress system of this game as you slowly unlock the regions by getting the slime keys. It can be monotone at a few times but once you start partly automating your farm you will have much more time to do various activities.

The story of Slime Rancher is very well put together and requires you to buy/access all the area's in the game to understand. There is also a Rush game mode where you have to sort of speed-run the game in a certain amount of time. As of writing this I have 27 hours of playtime and almost finished the game. I also achievement hunt and I've got to say there is a lot of replay-ability.

Even though my best friend -> that kind of introduced me to slime rancher <- loved this game ever since i 
met him i never really came around to play it until very recently. It always looked like a cool game and just whimsical experience from afar and after completing it's story i can only confirm that. But it's also so much more.

[h3]☆Graphics and Design☆[/h3]
I think slime ranchers art style has to be one of the most loved aspects of the game. It's so adorable, yet not overly complicated which just works out so so well. It also has something very unique about it that the sequel took and MASTERED a few years later. My only criticism about it all would be the map design. It's not bad, not by any means, but i would be lying if i'd tell you i wasn't fed up traversing this map after 20 hours of playtime (that's probably also because that's a lot of time to be fair). And, of course, the slimes are so adorable it physically hurts to look at them.

[h3]☆Gameplay☆[/h3]
I don't really have much to say about this section next to that i really enjoyed the gameplay all the way through. The game gives you a lot of freedom with whatever you want to do and lets you customize your ranch in plenty ways also which is always welcome. It's simplicity and calming atmosphere is great and achieving something (like adding a valuable upgrade to your ranch) feels so amazing. Oh, and the slimes are still so CUTE I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

[h3]☆Story☆[/h3]
Okay, first off,,, the concept of being almost entirely isolated on a far away planet is so special to me. It really spoke to me, felt somehow relatable and just made me want to leave and become a slime rancher too. Bea is a super enjoyable main character and the NPCs are a very memorable bunch. Casey's and bea's realationship was something that stuck out to me though. It was THE part of the story i loved most and always looked forward to continue.

So yeah, all in one this game has been incredible and the only reason i declared it ""finished"" is because i cannot wait to play slime rancher 2. If it's anything like its predecessor i know i will eat it up too.",1703027795,1703027936,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Slime Rancher is a cute, and relaxing game with cute little slimes, you put slimes in a pen and you have to feed them and take care of them so they don't get angry, and by feeding them they drop plorts and you take the plorts and sell them for money, and you can merge slimes to get bigger slimes aka (largos) this game really is a FUN game!

I LOVEEEE this game so much! it's such a fun, relaxing game I honestly could play this game forever, I only currently have 14 hours on it though, it's so so fun with a AMAZING concept, I haven't completed it yet but so far it's so amazing, I love the cute slimes, it's such a cute game! this is one of my favorite games for sure! I love everything about it!

To be honest this game has 0 downsides, it's such a good and cute game!!

1. Despite claims, this game will not work with Xbox One or Series X|S controllers (via Bluetooth) unless you enable Steam's input. This will cause occasional issues with things like the vacgun blast being triggered when you try to close a menu and sometimes you will get erratic movement when controller batteries get low. 

2. Don't expect any kind of story, it's literally just running around collecting slimes, feeding them to make them generate plorts, and then selling those or using them to make things. 

3. The tutorials could really be better, but it's not too difficult to figure out how to do things with some trial and error.

4. The four tanks limit will get real old real quick, especially when you try to explore some of the further reaches. It's also really difficult to tell which tank you have selected at any given time. Hopefully this will be addressed in Slime Rancher 2 at some point. You can get a mod to change this, thankfully. Otherwise it's just too much back and forth and trying to manage your inventory which makes the game more like work than fun.

If this game is on sale, like the $5 I got it for, it's definitely worth it. At full price it would be a more difficult value proposition.",1702327638,1702327638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been playing Slime Rancher on console, but the grind must go on.
Yeah, I bought it on pc. I'm just adding to my hundreds of hours.
Slime Rancher has an enormous amount of replayability. Every new playthrough, you can have a different combination of Largos on your ranch. Use your Slime Keys to unlock routes you haven't gone before.

The side quests and other Ranger Ranches and the VR Playground are great touches to the base content of this game. The music in this game is amazing. This truly is an amazing release from Monomi Park.

Slime Rancher is a very casual and laidback game, best experienced on controller or Console.

Slime Rancher is the cutest intergalactic adventure you never knew you needed – a squishy, bouncy, slime-tastic romp through the extraterrestrial farmlands. Get ready to embark on a journey where the only danger is getting too attached to your adorable, gelatinous livestock. Here's our whimsical take on Slime Rancher:

Graphics: ★★★★☆
Prepare your eyes for an explosion of color and cuteness! The vibrant, cartoonish graphics make you feel like you've stepped into a whimsical world of gooey wonders. From the jiggly slimes to the plump vegetables, the visual charm of Slime Rancher is enough to make even the grumpiest gamer crack a smile.

Gameplay: ★★★★★
Forget saving the world or defeating epic bosses; in Slime Rancher, your main goal is to gather as many squishy slimes as possible and manage your very own slime ranch. It's like farming, but with more bouncing blobs and less hay. The sheer joy of bouncing around collecting adorable creatures and watching them go about their slimy business is oddly satisfying.

Slime Variety: ★★★★★
From the standard pink slimes to the quirky phosphor slimes that glow in the dark, Slime Rancher boasts a rainbow of gooey diversity. Each slime has its own unique personality and quirks, making slime-wrangling a delightfully unpredictable experience. Just try not to get too attached to those googly-eyed faces.

Vacpack Gadgets: ★★★☆☆
The Vacpack, your trusty vacuum-like tool, is your best friend and multitool on the ranch. While it's fun to vacuum up slimes and resources, some of the gadgets are a bit wonky. The jetpack may send you soaring into the stratosphere when all you wanted was a gentle hop. But hey, it adds to the wacky charm!

Economy: ★★★★☆
Who knew that plort, the adorable name for slime poop, would become the currency of the land? The economy in Slime Rancher is as quirky as the game itself. Selling plorts and upgrading your ranch provides a satisfying sense of progression, even if you're scratching your head at the thought of a slime-based financial system.

Charm Factor: ★★★★★
Slime Rancher oozes charm – pun intended. The whimsical soundtrack, the goofy expressions of the slimes, and the overall feel-good atmosphere make this game a delightful escape from the more serious titles in your library. It's impossible not to crack a grin when a tabby slime gives you that adorable wide-eyed stare.

In conclusion, Slime Rancher is a bouncy, gooey, and downright charming adventure that will leave you with a heart full of warmth and a backpack full of plorts. It's a game that embraces the silly side of gaming, reminding us that sometimes, all you need is a handful of slimes to turn your day around. Grab your Vacpack and get ready to squish, bounce, and ranch your way to slimy success!",1701635356,1701635356,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed my time with it.

It lacks some quality of life improvements (for example the FOV only goes up to 90), but it's still a great game.

The only big problem I had with it was the ending. (Spoiler-free)
It was anticlimactic and confusing. 
The best way to prove this is the fact that, according to Steam stats, more than 6% of players fulfilled all the requirements for the ending, but just literally didn't notice, because they didn't get the ending achievement.

I will say that the game can get boring after a while, and there is almost so much you can do with the game as it’s no longer really receiving any new content since the creators made a sequel.

Collecting Slimes while waiting for your crops to grow, gathering resources to build drones or decorations, sorting out areas to where you grow crops, keep chickens and have slime enclosures. Then trying to make the weirdest Slime combinations, because why not.

At some point, I left The Grotto without any slime enclosures and let them roam free with a few crops so they don't starve, my little bee drones make sure all is organised and even so, there's still so much to do. It's also fun mixing the Slimes with all kinds of other types!

I also recommended this game to a friend with anxiety and they've said it helps them calm down, that's a win in my book!

I got this game pretty early with no expectation for much in the lore itself, and yet I was pleasantly surprised. After taking a break from the game I came back to a much more expansive and fleshed out version to make it all the more addicting, not only that, but the Devs continuously work on the game!

You can tell the Developers are passionate and do care about their game as well as the community.

[b][u]Exploration:[/u][/b]
Very few games still allow me to feel the excitement of exploration and reward, wanting to find out what's around the next corner, and having a world that's open, diverse, and unique enough to allow for this type of journey. Dark Souls and Skyrim are the only two modern game I can think of that have been able to do that, so this was a pleasant surprise from Slime Rancher.
You get a jetpack, which allows you to move horizontally a good distance, and a little bit vertically. This unique situation creates a fun almost puzzle like experience to try and get onto the highest structures, and look for little treasures, or new paths to zones. I probably spent half my playtime just climbing the mountains exploring. As you explore you find new slimes, which change the way you set up your ranch.

[b][u]Farming:[/u][/b]
The farming aspect is very unique. The dev team seems like a really creative bunch. You can farm regular crops and chickens, which is fun. However, the interesting part is the slime mechanics. You have to be able to keep them under control, where each has different variables to account for. Each has a unique diet, so you need to plan accordingly, which enters an almost strategic element to farming, which I don't think I've ever seen before. The slimes can also combine, and you can set up drones for automation.
There's also a science development mechanic where you creates gadgets to help you farm or explore. This requires gathering new resources and crafting new items. The crazy thing here, there's TONS of resources to collect, and they all serve a purpose, which is a lot of fun.

[b][u]Upgrades:[/u][/b]
There's a bunch of upgrades that you simply purchase. While simple, it's still a nice addition. You can upgrade your vacuum (the tool you use everything for), your health, jetpack, and the plots of land for gardening and slimes and what not. It's sort of a gate at times, where you need to get better in some regard, in order to make it to the next area, either by buying an expansion, growing new slimes, getting a new upgrade, etc. It's a neat way of setting it up so you can't just go everywhere immediately. This way, you get to intimately know each area, grow to love the different maps, and get even more excited to go explore the new place you just unlocked.

[b][u]Slimeopedia:[/u][/b]
There is an in-game wiki, which is made really well. I've read every entry, because they're well written, funny, informative, and not too long. This helps you progress in the game without having to go look things up on the internet, which is great. I hate when games don't tell you anything, and it's nearly impossible to figure out, so you have to look online. With Slime Rancher, the info is all built into the game, and they did it in a fun way. Some of the writing in it is actually really clever.

[b][u]Achievements:[/u][/b]
One of the things I hate most with game devs is when they butcher the achievements, making me hate the game before I'm done. This game thankfully does NOT do that! The achievements in this game are extremely well thought out. There's your typical progression ones, then ones that make you do something unique you never would have tried otherwise, ones that are difficult, and then the ones you really need to work for, that will require you to look at the game differently. The achievements actually add gameplay, which is how it should be. They also aren't unreasonable, making it completely possible to 100% the game, without getting frustrated and hating the game before you're done. I definitely recommend this to completionists. The way the game is built is actually for the completionist sort of mentality. You actually want to explore everything, own everything, find everything. Also, they didn't make achievements that they very easily could have, but that would have ruined the game, like finding every piece of treasure. If that were an achievement, it would have dragged the experience out, making it worse. They did not do that, which I imagine was a deliberate act on their part, because they're smart enough to know what will make good achievements. They put some real thought into them, and it shows.

[b][u]Good for kids:[/u][/b]
Editing my review to add this. My kids are 6 and 4, and they love it. It's quite easy (which is also a downside, see next point), so even little kids can get right into it. There's no real permanent mistakes you can make, so you can always recover. They can just let loose with their creativity, and making a mess of things. Just be aware you might have to help them if they mess stuff up too badly, haha. Also, you might have to protect them from the bad guys when they start screaming, lol.

[b][u]The Downside:[/u][/b]
I took my time with the game, just enjoying it, and I'm at 40 hours, with very little left to do. I'll probably still play for a while to get the last few achievements, but just note that it's not something like Minecraft, where you can play endlessly. You get to a point where your ranch is nearly perfect, you have total automation set up, you have all the upgrades, every type of slime, etc. and you're just sitting back watching the money pile up. At that point, there's nothing left to do. You've explored everything, own everything, and have mastered the world.
Now that said, 50-60 hours is good for a game, I'm just saying don't expect more than what it provides. It's a simple yet extremely unique and creative experience, definitely worth your time, and then you're done, and you can move on to other things.

Another downside is that it is a little on the easy side. The monster slimes (tarrs) don't really pose much of a threat. For example, my three year old daughter is playing this game with me on her own ranch. She's been surrounded by the tarrs, and she was panicking all scared, and I was able to coach her through it, without touching the controller, and she got away, and didn't even reach half health. She doesn't even know how to hold the controller properly, and has played very little video games. Just realize that the game isn't meant to be ""hard"" in that sense.

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
I highly recommend this game. It's been one of the more enjoyable games I've played in a long time, and I will always look back on it fondly. Even if you just look at the stats, 22% of the people who have started the game up have completed it, which is quite high for a game.

You are a slime rancher, similiar to a pokemon trainer, whose job it is to 'catch' and harvest slimes!
One of these games you see on steam and can't really get a grip on but once you give it a try it's a real fun experience.
This game was just developed with nothing but love in mind! Explore the 'Far, Far Range', catch and raise little (and big) slimes, upgrade your ranch and get rich!

Unfortunately, unlocking the teleporter is not enough. You need to craft it. That takes a diamond. Diamonds are a material that you need, and you can only get it by mining for materials you don't need until you eventually rank up to the next drill and the next.

Is drilling fun? No. Enjoy doing it for hours just to finally get access to a QoL upgrade that the rest of the game will assume you already have. This isn't helped by the fact that the core gameplay loop is finding a gordo, emptying your pockets into their mouth, and kicking rocks on your way home because almost EVERY single obstacle in this game takes at least two trips. This game is full of baffling choices like that, like the fact that side paths and main paths use the same keys and biomes don't unlock all at once. You could find yourself taking bizarre detours getting to a spot that should be right in front of you, and you might even find those bizarre detours becoming your main route because you still don't have teleporters.",1700422589,1700422589,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As someone who likes making things efficient, this is a game that both fuels and annoys that itch, since a lot of the game is maintaining your ranch but also needing to explore the world. I found myself a lot of times spending many in game days tending to the ranch and forgetting about the exploration aspect just because they make the ranch gameplay loop very addicting.
Though I do like how they integrated the lore and story into the game even though it is mostly through letters. A sense of discovery and adventure is prevalent and captures it well.
It does take a while to understand how everything works, especially since the game doesn't hold your hand and lets you free before you even understand what you're doing so get ready for that before you start playing.

Audio: 9/10 - cute noises, music is decent

Balance: 8/10 - pretty easy, but it’s a casual game so that’s the point

Design: 8/10 - design is fine, but can get cluttered

Fun: 9/10 - flying around with a jetpack and shooting slimes into the ocean but some of the puzzles are a bit grindy or confusing

Gameplay: 9/10 - exploration is interesting and the farming system is well built

Graphics: 9/10 - graphics are cute but nothing groundbreaking

Extras: 7/10 - none that I’ve ever tested, but there are a few such as the Secret Style Pack

Playtime: 9/10 - very long, kind of game you can put down for a few months and pick up right where you left off

Stability: 10/10 - never encountered any problems

Story: 8/10 - story is pretty good but nothing especially memorable

I love this game... it is one of my special interests and I will always find a way to bring it up or reference it no matter the conversation topic. my computer just meets the reqs and sometimes i catch hitches because of it, but it doesnt make me angry or want to put down the game. Even after finishing the story and maxing out my 7zee rewards i still want to pick it up and always find something to do... party weekend is always a treat and hunting for specific items and slimes never gets old...

I love it, its such  a cheerful and carefree chill building/farming game (apart from all the live chicken feeding and happy unknowing slimes about to be turned into hairgel and cleaning products xo ) .
Good controls, sounds and music but i wish u could keybind the 'hide ui' option instead of having to click it off each time in the settings.

WARNING tho, its incredibly addictive and if u cant manage urself and juuust have to collect and restock a few more from ur slime cages, u will be sucked into an endless circle of feed collect feed collect, once u have many slimes.
I recommend u keep ur slime amounts to a small amount, if u have issues with this kind of stuff!

[i]There will be a TL;DR at the end[/i]

~

When I first got this game on a Steam Sale, I was curious enough to install it and give it a try.
I thought that it would be a few moments of my adult mind being bored by the twee charms of an experience clearly crafted for small children.
It was a pleasant surprise when the game pulled me into its world and beckoned me further and further away from the ranch in a seemingly endlessly expanding adventure of new areas, new slimes, and unique ways to approach them.
After over 30 hours to date, there are still areas I have not yet explored and still some data entries that I haven't caught yet.

Not only is there always more to do, but the simplicity of the game's foundation mixed with its ebb and flow of managing the ranch and venturing out into the Far Far Range.

There's not much to the story itself - with it being more of a search for diary entries than anything fully engrossing (Or Distracting)

The aspect of nurturing your ranch from a dry plot of land into a sprawling complex with every kind of slime imaginable is exquisite. It's beyond addictive, it is fulfilling and interfaces seamlessly.

The graphics and overall game feel is sweet, but also impressive. Unlike many modern 'Cozy' or 'Cute' games that have the staying power of cotton candy, fading away the instant it is consumed, [i]Slime Rancher[/i]'s charm and unique appeal make it a memory that sticks with you. It's been years since I first play it, and the fond memories of exploring the levels and hunting down resources still comes to mind at times.

The journey is organic, interesting, and sucked me in for hours upon hours before I could even bring myself to be responsible enough to put it down - but it was a warm and familiar thing for me to return to.

When darkness swells inside the soul and the tempest rages around you, the Far Far Range is still waiting for you to return and fall in love with its charm all over again. It is a trusted friend that will comfort you and make you smile even in the worst of times.

The developers have made something truly special.
From its charming presentation in music, sight, and sense - to the addicting gameplay of gathering slimes and the resources that they need to thrive in order to expand your ever-growing ranch - [i]Slime Rancher[/i] is something that I will never forget, and will fondly return to whenever I need something to warm my soul in a wholesome way.

This is not simply a game for young children. It is a creative spark brought to life in a display of talent, love, and competence.

Allow me to introduce you to ""Slime Rancher,"" a game that might make you question your claims of having a respectable adult job. I've spent the last 30 hours of my life corralling bouncy, adorable blobs and trading their... let's say, ""resources"" on the stock market or for scientific purposes. Now, how do I explain this to my exercise class buddies without losing all credibility? It's a tricky task.

""Slime Rancher"" places you in the boots of Beatrix LeBeau, a rancher marooned a thousand light years from Earth. Your mission? Build a ranch, expand your horizons in the alien world, and, oh yes, deal with the wacky creatures that call this place home.

The game kicks off with a modest house on a barren piece of land. Little squares indicate where you can construct structures to house your slimes or cultivate resources. It's pretty lifeless, except for the bouncy pink blobs bounding around in their perpetual state of joy, occasionally cooing over a carrot.

Your initiation into the ranching business is quite straightforward. The game teaches you the basics: how to vacuum slimes into your backpack, deposit them in pens, and feed them carrots to induce the, let's say, digestive process. Their colorful excrements, called plorts, take center stage in the game's systems.

Plorts are the lifeblood of your endeavors. Early on, it's all about vacuuming up plorts and tossing them into the plort market to turn a profit. As you amass currency, you can unlock a lab area, where plorts combine with other resources to create decorations and labor-saving gadgets for your ranch. They also hold the key to unlocking secrets in the regions you'll explore.

Slimes come in various flavors, with the basic pink slimes being the easiest to manage. They'll eat anything and are consequently less valuable on the plort market. Market prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, and I learned that flooding the market daily results in lower profits. For a min-maxer, waiting for opportune moments might be the way to go. However, I took a more relaxed approach.

Here's where things get interesting. Slimes can, shall we say, crossbreed if they consume plorts from different species. This leads to fascinating results, like giant pink tabby cat blobs or glow-in-the-dark rocky hybrids. These hybrid slimes have advantages, as they can consume the food of both parent species. However, they take up more space and are harder to contain, leading to costlier pen requirements.

Things get truly chaotic if you mix too many different slimes together. They can turn into nightmarish Tarrs, which will obliterate everything on your ranch. It's a lesson I learned the hard way.

But the game's real charm lies in the balance between exploring the alien world and expanding your homestead. As you venture out to new places, gathering crops and resources, you'll gradually familiarize yourself with these unique spaces. Your farming skills and technology will grow, prompting you to revisit earlier areas for fresh opportunities.

After around 30 hours, I felt content with my ranching adventure. The game's limitations started to wear on me, and grinding for more money felt less appealing. A desire for more automation in farming also surfaced. I wanted crops to be automatically deposited and plorts to be divided between the market and lab. While automation might have reduced the mundane tasks, it would have left me with too little to do.

Furthermore, the ranch's layout felt quite restrictive, especially when decorating. I wished for more freedom in placing structures and elements.

Despite these quirks, ""Slime Rancher"" offers a delightful 30-hour experience filled with exploration, mystery, and adorable chaos. The game's secrets unravel at a pleasing pace, and its whimsical world is a joy to discover. It's a bouncy rainbow in a gaming landscape dominated by drab shooters. I couldn't be happier that a game like Slime Rancher exists.",1697957142,1697957142,True,3,0,0.538461506366729736,0,True,False,False

Map design is confusing and indistinguishable near and after the end even with reference to tutorial videos. Still haven’t unlocked all the ancient water fountains. Big slimes are also misleading-they could be access to critical areas or simply some nonsense materials that could’ve been obtained effortlessly otherwise, and it’s more than frustrating when the latter happens (majority of the time). Frustration turns to torture with the movement system. Didn’t ask you to be Valkyrie in Apex Legends, but at least the avatar shouldn’t be shooting the a££ out of her feeble farting jetpack while only be able to reach 4 feet high. BTW, this dumb jetpack and sprint shoes take tens of thousands of bucks to acquire.

Now for the collection part. Yes, the cross breeding of slimes is interesting, but the fun easily perishes after couple of minutes. The price drop system even makes the efforts to obtain new slimes seem meaningless. When players want to obtain materials for crafting the game most certainly discourages versatility-breed one type of slimes with others so you can plant only one type of food and have maximum efficiency. The carnivorous slimes are not ideal to raise without herbivores because chicken breeding is just so inefficient.  

BTW, the extended ranches such as Viktor’s lab and the mercury ranch are synonyms for boredom. I spent about an hour on the single repeating task of spotting and chasing slimes, highly focused and almost shoved my face into the screen, in the end the game gave me nothing more than some land and thumb pain. “Oh but the new slimes.” YES there were new slimes, and YES there were special mechanisms, but you have access to them in the game level, meaning that if you wanna see them again you gotta chase after their a££ for almost no reward and almost no interaction. Makes me recall my girlfriend on bed, no matter what I do she lies there doing the same stuff. The saber-toothed slime is the only exception were you can take its crystals from the world and cross-breed it with the original slimes you have.

You can call me a hater, but most of the players in the comment section either only have played for less than ten hours or are masochistic (like I sometimes am) and have played for more than thirty hours.",1697947024,1697947024,False,2,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

While I am a completionist and worked to do all the things, there is no time gating where you will miss out on any content or need to rush. The graphics are great and the controls fairly smooth. All the slimes are insanely cute. Good luck picking your favorites ;)

My only real critique is that - like others have said - you get teleport systems and late game content a bit *too late*... like to the point where you might be done with the game, and there's no reason to keep going even though you get cool new things. Even with this, the game is amazingly fun, addicting, and chill.

The exploration is excellent, the slimes are cute, the soundtrack is excellent, truly just a phenomenal experience for folks who like laid back exploration and farming games. Clearly it doesn't have a AAA budget, but every decision Monomi Park made in putting this game together was the right decision, and they used all the resources they had very efficiently. The graphics are simple, but beautiful with excellent art direction, for example.

Truly what sets this game apart from a lot of others in the genre, however, is how well it actually tells a story. You never meet another person, but getting messages from people you used to know, interfacing with other ranchers who are out here in the depths of space for their own reasons, finding logs left behind by the explorer who came before you--it asks a lot of interesting questions about why you're here, playing this game right now.

I'm not the type who sees games like this as chill or relaxing. I'm the kind of psycho who stresses over every little thing in these sandboxy games. A buddy of mine once said I approach every task in Stardew Valley like someone is holding my entire family hostage, and honestly I can't argue. But that's a large part of the appeal of these kinda sims for me, refining and refining until I reach a state of equilibrium.

And that's the thing, I think they know about people like me. I think they had the kind of player I am in mind from the get-go. Because it feels like there are parts of this designed specifically to nudge people away from that style of play. And I don't even think that's necessarily a bad thing, I kinda respect it.

Normally, the way I approach these kinda games is to focus on one part of my sandbox until it's more-or-less hands off, then pivot to the next with the resources gained along the way. Obviously, gotta dip your toe in many areas on the side, but usually it's easy to do the bare minimum with side ventures until it's time to **optimize**. In Slime Rancher, that ""hands off"" point never comes, at least not until late-late game for even minor setups. Even a fully decked out corral with an autofeeder/autocollector needs pretty regular refilling/emptying, and because your ranch areas are pretty spread out, you have to do a lot of running back and forth to keep on top of everything and making sure the Quantum/Explosive slime crossbreeds you thought would be a good idea aren't quantum-tunneling out of their enclosure because the guy who thought he could play slime god forgot to get metaphysical lemons. Just as a hypothetical.

What I'm trying to get at is, no matter how much you try to hyperfocus on one thing, Slime Rancher says ""Okay but what if everything lit on fire just sometimes. Bet you didn't think of that, Mr. Perfectionist."" and as much as it drives me up the wall, I get it. No matter how much you upgrade your tech, and improve your technique, there's always this element of chaos. Many of this game's mechanics have something that makes them just slightly wonky, so you never quite lose that feeling of doing things a little messy. That it's okay to mess up sometimes, that you don't have to be flawless about everything. Anti-perfectionism.

Could I just be coping with the fact that I still suck ass and panic about everything after 30 hours of playing? Perhaps. But it's fun to analyze shit like this.

I have been obsessed with this game for the better part of a week and I've done so many things and I'm already almost done with everything after a total play time of 24 Hours. Granted I already know what I'm doing so I the idea of what to get down and what to unlock. People who are knew to this game with have plenty of time to explore and find things on there own. Even after 24 hours of playtime I have a few things left and how I sped run the game basically means that there are going to be countless hours of playtime for those new.

This game is truly amazing with the different areas and mechanics it introduces slowly throughout the game. It doesn't feel rushed when introducing these either which makes progression feel like you're at the right place. This game allows you to go at your own pace so you never feel like you're behind. Just take your time and enjoy the scenery and music while you play. Even when you think you're done there is always something else to do. I have about 2 big things left for me to do on my own play through and even then something else that i haven't thought about yet might come up giving me more time do to the things I love in this amazing game. 

When I do end up finishing I can always transition to the second game which I hope has the same or even more content than this game has to introduce. I haven't played.

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my husband had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

This is one of the farming games that I've ever found fun to play. The controls feel very smooth and satisfying. You also get rewarded for exploring with little treasures. It does get micromanegy at times, but it does get easier later in game when you are able to create certain things.

 The slimes look so adorable, though, some are very annoying to deal with. The only thing I didn't like was where you help other ranchers. The gameplay was incredibly repetitive and the final reward isn't really worth it in my opinion, because I already have everything I needed in my own ranch.

Slime Rancher es un relajante juego de granjas y aventuras en primera persona, totalmente carente de estrés al contar con tan pocas adversidades que incluso pueden desactivarse jugando en dificultad ""Casual"".

Artísticamente (Tanto en términos musicales como visuales) da todo de sí para sentirse tranquilizador, y su loop jugable es la constante dopamina nacida de comprar casillas o mejoras para generar más ingresos a invertir.

No es nada novedoso pero sí resulta entretenido; por otra parte la exploración es uno de sus peores aspectos. El constante ir y volver no sería tan incómodo si no fuera por los únicos 4 espacios disponibles en el inventario (Descartando el espacio para líquidos), por tanto apenas tengas 4 objetos distintos habrá que regresarse a pie todo el camino hasta casa.

El mapamundi no es de particular ayuda y las diferentes zonas no aportan una gran diferencia más allá del color del suelo y un par de assets. Son cosas que puedo entender y perdonar en un proyecto de bajos recursos, pero que de igual forma tienen su impacto en el producto final.

It is probably the most family-friendly game in its category. There is a lot of pointing and aiming with first-person 3D controls, but basically no violence. There is a simulated daily cycle, but no time pressure. Most of the reading is optional, and the counting is very simple. So it is suitable for a kid just learning to read and compare numbers.

The progression in the original Slime Rancher is mostly based on collecting certain numbers of items, which can be found through exploration and cultivation. The sequel introduces more tiers of tools required to unlock more items which can be used to craft more tools.",1694807647,1694807647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A girl with a dream and a job that sends her 1,000 lightyears away from Earth to a planet called The Far, Far Range to become a Rancher of a strange, unusual, and surprisingly profitable species – Slimes. Take control of an old Ranch, fix her up, build your corrals to contain any interesting Slimes you may obtain after exploring this strange Island, and follow the clues and notes left behind from The Ranch’s former owner.

7-40+ hours to complete; Slime Rancher is an Open-World Singleplayer Adventure game with a vibrant, cute, and colorful art style. There are a wide variety of Slimes you can capture and even more when you start dabbling in making your own type of Slime by mixing two together. The Island is big, beautiful, and for the most part, pretty fun to explore with many mysteries. Some cons I would like to bring up, is the incredibly short story mode; you can finish the game pretty quickly, and on accident if you’re good at exploring! Another thing is the game tends to give you access to useful items far too late; by the time I no longer needed to backtrack and had access to all the Slimes I needed to; I got teleporters. After I explored every inch of the island and found all it’s secrets, I finally got the Treasure Crackers needed to open all the previous inaccessible treasure chests discovered. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3029240899
While Slime Rancher is a really, really good game, I wish there were just some things it could have done better. Backtracking is very frequent, and finding all these neat treasure chests and having no way to open them during the initial exploration was kinda depressing. Regardless, I liked it, it’s a very good game that’s genuinely enjoyable and many people clearly love it too – considering it’s getting a movie adaptation.

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

Slime Rancher invites players to embark on a delightful and colorful journey to a distant world teeming with adorable, gelatinous creatures. With its charming visuals, engaging gameplay mechanics, and the allure of ranching and nurturing slimes, the game offers a unique and endearing experience that captures the hearts of players young and old.

The visual design of Slime Rancher is a whimsical feast for the eyes, presenting players with a vibrant and imaginative world where slimes come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. The game's cartoonish style adds to the charm, creating an atmosphere that is both lively and delightful.

At its core, Slime Rancher combines elements of ranch management, exploration, and creature collection. Players take on the role of a ""slime rancher,"" capturing and raising slimes on their very own ranch. The mechanics are accessible, with players collecting and feeding slimes to harvest valuable resources known as ""plorts.""

The joy of discovery is a standout feature, as players explore new environments, encounter different types of slimes, and uncover the secrets of the world. The sense of exploration and the thrill of finding new and rare slimes create an engaging sense of curiosity.

The game's blend of ranching and resource management mechanics adds depth to the gameplay. Players must balance their ranch's ecosystem, feed slimes the right food to produce valuable plorts, and upgrade their facilities to optimize their ranching operation.

However, the game's relatively relaxed pace and lack of intense challenges might not resonate with players seeking more action-oriented experiences. Slime Rancher leans more towards a casual and laid-back gameplay style.

The game's learning curve and mechanics might require some time for new players to grasp. While the initial stages are accessible, mastering the intricacies of ranch management and resource optimization could take a while.

In conclusion, Slime Rancher offers a charming and heartwarming adventure that invites players to embrace the world of adorable slimes and the joy of ranching. Its whimsical visuals, engaging mechanics, and the allure of discovery create an experience that is both relaxing and endearing. While its casual pace and lack of intense challenges might not appeal to everyone, those who appreciate a light-hearted and colorful world filled with delightful creatures will find themselves immersed in the captivating ranching journey of Slime Rancher, where every slime and plort hold the promise of a vibrant and gelatinous escapade.",1693030949,1693030949,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Slime rancher is a 10/10 game for me,but as every game it has it's flaws.The story is decent,but could've been way more interesting and the ending was a little weird.The back-tracking can get a little annoying at times.Besides the mods that don't really work for me,the game is a masterpiece and you should give it a try.

The game runs smoothly and looks great.

It may not be abundant with features but there are certainly enough, sufficiently well placed, to where the game keeps you engaged. The aim of the game is to collect different types of slimes to where there drops will provide different quantities of money depending on the rarity (how far the slime is in the games progression system) of the slime. You can combine slimes to make collecting their drops more efficient and the exploration and progression system are fantastic. 

Shouldn't take you longer than 20 hours to complete the game but definitely worth the play. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys casual gameplay and cute slimes. Forgot to mention the soundtrack is really fitting :)",1691104603,1691104603,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has good content, with possibilities to merge whatever type of slimes, making them cuter (obviously if you want to focus on the effectiveness of getting more plorts, it's a bit different). My focus was not at all on the story, since I knew the game before, however, even after the story is over you can continue playing and improve the ranch, with some ""never ending"" tasks (I think).

In the end-game, already with 100% of the achievements, I still felt I didn't have as much to do because it became repetitive, since I was having problems storing so many plorts and the market is a bit complicated system for me to deal with.

Slime Rancher is a carefree and (mostly) stress-free farm management game that blends exploration and farming in a seamless manner, creating an addictive gameplay loop which is mostly driven by the player's curiosity.

[list]
[*][b]Farming[/b]
[/list]
A lot of your time will be spent farming, and while it's not a complicated system at all, mostly just asking of the players that they take the slimes' diets into account, there are a plethora of interesting tools that make this aspect of the game more efficient and/or automated, I found this aspect of SR to be welcoming to both casual players and the min-maxers. 

[list]
[*][b]Exploration[/b]
[/list]
By exploring you find new slimes and crops (and meat) for your farm, there are a lot of secret areas and chest to be found if the player decides to go off the beaten path and as a result each discovery feels rewarding, everything you find is useful in one way or another. 
There are also a number of locked doors that lead to new areas giving the player great motivation to find the keys that eventually open them, finally setting foot in a new part of the map feels great!
Although very different games, I felt that SR's exploration sometimes gave off Metroid Prime vibes in its approach, there are a couple of sequence breaks too if you're into that ;)

Finding something new is exciting, throughout the whole first playthrough with each new discovery it left me guessing ""what's next?"" and thinking ""that's so cool!"".

[list]
[*][b]Progression[/b]
[/list]
The game's systems effortlessly flow into each other and progression is handled so that both farming and exploration reward the players with tools that help with one aspect or the other, so that they can either farm or explore more efficiently. Progress in one of the two aspects eventually means progress in the other. Mostly.

I found that SR lacked a reason to keep the player playing after having expolored all the map.
Other than unlocking all the achievements (which is fun), you'll find that way after the credits roll there will still be a lot of stuff left to unlock that doesn't really serve much of a purpose as there is no particular goal anymore. I also didn't agree with the choice to lock the ability to open chests behind unlocking the [spoiler]Laboratory[/spoiler] since I think finding them should be enough to earn the player the reward, I suggest you unlock it as early as you can so that you don't finish the game with most chests unopened, it can easily happen.

In other words, while really really good until the credits roll, the synergy between farming and exploration is lacking in the endgame, curiosity won't be a drive anymore since there will be nothing left to explore even if there are still a lot of things to unlock but not a lot of reasons to use them.

[list]
[*][b]Visuals & Sound[/b]
[/list]
Visuals are not groundbreaking in themselves, especially when it comes to UI, art direction however is pretty neat! Environments are easily recognizable even without looking at the map, and the different slimes (and their ""fusions"") look funny and adorable, and even threatening sometimes. Unfortunately performance on a 1050 (which isn't some incredible GPU, I know) was quite lacking even if it never even came close to unplayable, there were framerate drops and stutters all over the place, optimization isn't the best and SR should run fine on this hardware as do many other more graphically demanding games.

Soundtrack is catchy and upbeat mostly, there are a couple pieces that stand out as more melancholic and grandiose near the end and those are great too, sound is really satisfying when shooting stuff into the market board (selling) and in a game like this that's the best you can ask for.

[list]
[*][b]Final thoughts[/b]
[/list]
Slime Rancher is definitely a game worth playing if you're looking for a colorful fun farming game that's very exploration driven and doesn't hold your hand but is accessible nonetheless, not having a time limit makes it so that it's never particularly stressful. It's enjoyable on multiple levels making it a lot of fun for both experienced and unexperienced players.",1678136157,1690738383,True,26,1,0.727272748947143555,0,True,False,False

My only problem is that after 30 hours, I'd reached every area and collected every type of slime and felt that there wasn't much to do after that. There are the minigames where you can unlock more areas to house more slimes or grow veggies but I personally didn't feel the need for so much space. Maybe the game isn't meant to be played for much more than that, I couldn't say, but I personally felt I'd accomplished everything I wanted to do after the 30 hour mark.

Very minor con there, but overall it's a fantastic game! Such a cute art style, I love that each slime design was created with care and love. I loved finding each one and trying out different combinations to get different largos. There was always excitement and wonder whenever I found new slime types and I instantly wanted to catch them.

You can grow crops, harvest resources, trade with other ranchers, and raise chickadoos to feed your slimes along with building corrals for them. You can also create cool gadgets, decorations, and upgrades for your vacpack as well as your ranch, while also exploring the secrets and dangers of this mysterious planet.

I had to buy the soundtracks just for someone to get more of my money. In an unexplainable way, the main narrative of the game just resonates with me. The peacefulness and existential questions make me endlessly sad and thoughtful.

God I love this game! I played it first on the xbox years ago, and have been feeling nostalgic to the peaceful and cute atmosphere of the game. Purchasing it again was an amazing choice. 9/10.

The game can be ""beat"" in roughly 8 hours of work and exploration. It is very simple in mechanics and the way to the end; however, new players will likely explore many areas and spend their keys on things that don't progress to the end. 

The story of the game comes in letters from your SO and notes placed around the map by the ranches previous owner. The dialogue from the previous owner is deep, sad, and wholly relatable.

The only downside I see to the game is it can feel a bit grindy in the end. Once you finish the main exploration and unlock the map, the end is just collecting as much money and plorts as possible to unlock toys and customization of your ranch. I wish there was slightly more automation, or at least not so much building contraptions for the lab. That being said, it is completely optional and provides nothing to the game than if you want to 100% your customization and prettiness.",1679512036,1689821261,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With its captivating visuals, charming characters, and a world teeming with adorable slimes, this game has earned its place as a true wholesome gem in the gaming world.

One of the standout features of Slime Rancher is its vibrant and visually stunning world. The Far, Far Range, the game's setting, is a magical place filled with lush landscapes, colorful flora, and the cutest, squishiest slimes you'll ever encounter. The attention to detail is remarkable, and exploring this captivating environment is an absolute pleasure. Each area is distinct and has its own unique charm, making the game feel alive and full of wonder.

The game's mechanics are intuitive and accessible, allowing players of all ages to enjoy the experience.

The slimes themselves are undeniably the stars of the show. From the adorable pink slimes that greet you at the beginning to the quirky, specialized slimes that inhabit later areas, each one has its own distinct personality. It's impossible not to fall in love with their playful antics and endearing behaviors. The sound design and animation further enhance their charm, making every interaction a delightful experience.

The gameplay loop in Slime Rancher is addictive and rewarding. You'll find yourself constantly exploring, discovering new slimes, and expanding your ranch with new corrals, gardens, and gadgets. The progression feels natural, allowing you to unlock new areas and abilities at a comfortable pace. The game strikes a perfect balance between relaxation and challenge, making it suitable for both casual and more dedicated players.

Beyond the ranching mechanics, Slime Rancher offers a deep sense of exploration and discovery. Throughout the game, you'll stumble upon hidden secrets, uncover lore, and encounter intriguing characters. The world-building is exceptional, leaving you with a sense of awe and curiosity. The developers have crafted a rich and immersive universe that invites you to lose yourself in its captivating narrative.

Slime Rancher is more than just a game; it's an experience that evokes pure joy and positivity. Its charming aesthetics, delightful gameplay, and heartfelt themes make it a true masterpiece of wholesome entertainment.

With its charming visuals, addictive gameplay, and a world brimming with lovable slimes, Slime Rancher offers a unique and captivating experience that will leave players enchanted.

One of the standout features of Slime Rancher is its whimsical and vibrant art style. The game's colorful and cartoonish visuals create a cheerful atmosphere that is both visually appealing and relaxing. The slimes themselves are utterly adorable, each with their own distinct appearances and behaviors. From the bouncy pink slimes to the fiery rock slimes, encountering and collecting these charming creatures is an absolute joy.

The core gameplay revolves around managing a slime ranch on the distant Far, Far Range. As Beatrix LeBeau, players embark on a journey to collect and care for various types of slimes. The ranch requires careful planning, from building corrals and gardens to feed the slimes, to expanding and upgrading the facilities. The game strikes a perfect balance between simplicity and depth, making it accessible for players of all ages, yet offering enough complexity to keep them engaged.

Exploration is a key aspect of Slime Rancher. Venturing into different areas of the Far, Far Range unveils new slimes, resources, and secrets. Discovering hidden caves or rare slimes adds a sense of adventure and accomplishment. The world feels expansive, with each area offering unique landscapes and challenges to overcome.

One of the game's most enjoyable mechanics is slime wrangling. Players must learn the behavior and preferences of different slimes, carefully capturing them and ensuring they are well-fed and content. Mixing different types of slimes can lead to lucrative plorts, which serve as the game's currency. Experimenting with slime combinations adds a layer of strategy and discovery.

Slime Rancher's progression system is well-balanced, providing a steady stream of new abilities, upgrades, and areas to explore. As you unlock new gadgets and improvements, such as jetpacks or teleporters, the gameplay becomes more dynamic and exciting. The sense of growth and accomplishment keeps players motivated and eager to continue their ranching adventures.

While Slime Rancher is a delightful and addictive experience, it does have a few minor drawbacks. The game's objectives can become repetitive over time, and some players may desire more complex challenges or additional activities to keep them engaged in the long run. However, the developers have consistently released updates and free content expansions, adding new features and gameplay elements to keep the experience fresh.

In conclusion, Slime Rancher is a charming and captivating game that will warm the hearts of players of all ages. Its delightful visuals, addictive gameplay mechanics, and lovable slimes make it a joy to play. Whether you're tending to your ranch, exploring the vibrant world, or simply enjoying the adorable antics of the slimes, Slime Rancher offers a whimsical and relaxing escape that will leave you with a smile on your face.",1689192893,1689192893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game offered a blissful oasis where I could forget life's burdens and immerse myself in the vibrant world of adorable, bouncing slimes.

However, as fate would have it, my real-life obligations began to encroach upon the time I had set aside for Slime Rancher. Endless deadlines, familial responsibilities, and unexpected challenges took precedence, leaving the slimes abandoned on the virtual range.

Days turned into weeks, and the sound of playful slime giggles slowly faded away. Yet, within the realm of my overwhelming reality, a void formed, longing for the companionship of those squishy creatures. I yearned to return to the ranch, to the innocence and simplicity that only existed in the embrace of digital worlds.

Finally, a moment of clarity emerged amidst the chaos. I realized that taking a break from the turbulence of my daily life was essential for both my mental rejuvenation and happiness. Slime Rancher served as a gentle reminder of the importance of self-care and the beauty of simplicity—lessons I had momentarily forgotten.

With renewed determination, I re-entered the virtual realm of Slime Rancher, greeted by the familiar melodies of cheerful slimes. Their radiant smiles radiated warmth, serving as a beacon of solace and positivity. In their presence, I found solace once again, reminded that even amidst the unpredictable nature of existence, there will always be joy waiting to be rediscovered.",1689173607,1689173607,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hey all^^

I know Slime Rancher part 2 will be out soon, so most ppl call this game ""old"".
For me this game can never turn old^^ it is so cute, love able and mysterious, sometimes it remembers me on the first Mario Game on Gameboy^^ And that is really old laugh.

I had a hard time to get myself buying that, it looked so colorful and it appeared as if you have to force 30 Slimes in one cage... But then I found the demo^^
When I played the demo I got Slime addicted I never knew I could become a Slime fan but here I am born^^

You can find so much out in this game. Some puzzles, some farming, some creative events. Short it never is boring and when Winter comes (real world) you will find some new Slimes^^
There a lots of DLC some even for free! That will make the whole adventure more exciting.^^

I had my fun 43 hours not done^^ (winter event I wait for yahhh^^^)
I kept my time, in the beginning I had some bad experiences with my manufacturing^^
But every first try is embarrassed, but it was fun it still is fun and my own creation of slimes, hilarious cute!

Result: You like Slime or cute animals? You like to find out mystery of the island and yourself? You know that you are the owner of your farm and can keep the slimes how you like? You like to decorate, paint and build the place to your liking? Than try the Demo out this instant!

Thx for this nice game, it was fun, it is fun and for me it will remain fun forever^^

Greetings a huge fan

Звездная почта и терминалы Хоббсона очень легко пропустить и проигнорировать, и все же, если вы обратите на них внимание, вы будете вознаграждены множеством советов и хитростей, жизненных советов, важных уроков, а также сможете пройти его путь, а затем начать свое собственное приключение.

Well, at the beginning I guess.

Slime Rancher is a very chill exploration and life sim ranching game. We play as Beatrix LeBeau, a rancher who moves from Earth to The Far, Far Range to begin her life as a “slime rancher” (Hey, that’s the name of the game!)

First thing you see after the opening text of the game is the beautiful art style. This game is up there with my favourite game art styles, such as Team Fortress 2 and Hollow Knight. It is such a beautiful, cheery and bubbly style that strikes the perfect balance of not too bright and not too toned down. You feel a sense of comfort and safety here, even though the place is completely brand new.

We start out in our ranch, previously owned by Hobson Twilligers, in a pretty bad state, and learn how the basics of the game. How to use our Vacpack, feeding slimes and keeping them. Not too long after that, we venture out into the world, our first location. You’ll come back to your ranch eventually and it has 4 distinct locations to unlock. The Lab, which we’ll get to later, The Grotto and The Overgrowth, themed expansions for your ranch, and The Docks which is also another (although, smaller) expansion.

I’ll just be giving a general overview of locations because I don’t want to spoil them if you do play the game.

The Dry, Dry Reef. Not my personal favourite, but it holds a place in my heart. A mainly orange mountainous area full of nooks and crannies to explore and a great first area for newcomers to learn in. What once was a reef is now a land area where you’ll find many slimes and spend most of your time until you find your first Gordo and Slime Key.

With a Slime Key, you can open up two new areas: The Indigo Quarry, or my second personal favourite, The Moss Blanket.

The Indigo Quarry is, well, a quarry like area, with many little island-like areas to go between and explore, with beautiful hexagonal crystals around everywhere giving The Indigo Quarry the distinct look it has which you’ll find no where else, among many caves to explore. There is also a way to get to the Ash Isle in The Indigo Quarry, which is a very cool volcanic area.

The Moss Blanket is a jungle like area, and it is huge with it split into two distinct areas: The main land and the smaller island congregation. The area is vibrant and full of colour while not overdoing it, full of massive trees, flowers, vines, oversized logs and vines.

Both these areas have Slime Key doors which lead you to The Ancient Ruins Courtyard. A utterly HUGE door with slime statues all around where you must give the statue the corresponding plort to open the door, and then brings you to my personal favourite area in the game…

The Ancient Ruins. Everything about this area is just amazing, the funny doors, the funny echoes, the soundtrack, the visuals, the slimes, the fruits… It is all perfect. Makes an area that seems cliché and dingy feel very unique. This area houses the portal to the last area in the game too, which is:

The Glass Desert. One of the most unique areas in the game, and I will only say it houses the ending to the game.

You have the Range Exchange on your ranch, a way to trade with people across The Far, Far Range. Some of these people will give you opportunities to help them and work with them if you do enough of these.

Mochi Miles will ask you to help her with obtaining the elusive Quicksilver Slime plorts, which is a fun minigame where you shoot electric balls at them to get the plorts. Finish it, and you’ll get cool upgrades and you’ll be allowed to use the plots at Mochi’s Manor.

Ogden Ortiz will ask you to get his favourite plant, the Kookadoba, from a place called “The Wilds” full of thought to be extinct Saber Slimes, which of course are feral. Ogden will give you upgrades for your garden and allow you to use the plots at Ogden’s Retreat if you finish the amount he requests.

Viktor Humphries will ask you to help him to debug his “Slimeulation”. This is possibly one of the best help requests in the game, where you are asked to traverse an increasingly unstable Slimeulation in order to collect Glitch Slimes for bug reports. In exchange for finishing, he’ll give you cool new Slime Science gadgets and, of course, the plots in his lab.

Wait, Slime Science? Yep! This game has a pretty basic but fleshed out science system, and a fun one at that. Put drills, apiaries and pumps all around the world and depending where you put them, you’ll get different items. Varying levels of extractors, with the best being a 7Zee Rewards Club reward, which we’ll get to soon. You can craft all kinds of cool stuff at the previously aforementioned lab, whether it be stupid fashion pods and games, drones, more extractors, decorations, or useful items, there is a lot. Most of these blueprints are found through treasure pods around The Far, Far Range.

Through the upgrade station at your ranch (which allows you to buy a jetpack by the way, amazing!) Through the 7Zee Rewards Club, you can earn Treasure Cracker upgrades, which allow you to start opening treasure pods. Pretty neat, huh?

Alright, what the hell is the 7Zee Rewards Club? Pretty simple. A small thing where you pay a sum of money to get rewards, which stops at level 28. Not that exciting but it unlocks a cooler looking ranch.

To pair with the art, the soundtrack to this game is phenomenal. It can be chaotic, calming or spooky and still sound like Slime Rancher. Also, there’s a track for each location for day and night, and the night tracks are usually a lot more calm and chill, with the day tracks being upbeat and a bit rowdy. Also, the end credits song is very emotional. Very few games make me cry, but the end credits did it for me.

All this, and I forgot to talk about the slimes! Many different types, all with different diets (meat, fruit, veggie, water, ash) different little things they do, and different ways to keep them, but there’s one thing they all have in common: they’re all darn cute.

I’ve played this game since the early access, and this game holds a very special place in my heart. While it doesn’t get updates anymore, and probably won’t considering Slime Rancher 2 is being developed now, it got me through rough times and it has to be my favourite game of all time. 

Also, the Tabby Slime is amazing, I mean, just look at that little boop it does!

If you read all of this, thank you, and if you buy the game, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

Slime Rancher is an adorable farming/adventure sim where your main goal is to find every type of slime, establish a corral for them on your farm, and feed them regularly in order to grow your profits. The main gameplay loop is centered around exploration. The homestead that you begin with is fairly self-sufficient from the get-go and the player is left free to explore the various connected islands within the game, gathering foods, collectables, and, most importantly, all varieties of slimes along the way.

The art style of this game is fantastic. In fact, the entire atmosphere of the game perfectly encapsulates that cozy-game spirit that so many games struggle to find. The music is pleasant, the landscapes are beautiful, and the slimes are cute. Also, importantly, there is nothing scary in this game. Sure, there are enemies, but they are slow-moving, bad at attacking, and also cute in their own ugly way. If atmosphere alone made a game great, then Slime Rancher would be one of the best.

The gameplay is, overall, great. The focus on exploration that this game has lends itself well to the gameplay loop which it establishes. By that I mean that it would boring if all you did in this game was tend to your slimes on your farm. The mechanics are not complex enough to warrant that, but they aren’t supposed to be. The player is supposed to be out exploring the majority of the time, with only an hour or so here and there at the farm, mostly spent reconfiguring your various slimes in different corrals, trying out different slime fusions, and expanding into newly purchased locations. Once everything is set up again, off you go into the wild. I don’t mean to suggest, however, that the slime ranch is boring. I, for one, found a great deal of enjoyment in rearranging my slimes and making my farm as efficient as possible. But this is not entirely necessary. The complexity is there, but only if the player has a self-imposed inclination towards efficiency.

The exploration in Slime Rancher is great. The movement takes a bit of getting used to, but once one is accustomed to it, the movement feels great. It is fast and dynamic, allowing the player to sprint quite quickly and for a long period of time (once upgrades are purchased). The game also allows the player access to just about anywhere on the map, aided by the handy jetpack. In Slime Rancher, out-of-bounds doesn’t really exist. One of my first, great moments with this game was when I realized that the game allowed me to walk on top of cliffs which had heretofore acted only as walls. Then, after I found an item on the cliff, I realized that I wasn’t just allowed to be up there, but I was supposed to be. Freedom is a great feeling which many games don’t allow the player due to various factors, primarily technical limitations, but Slime Rancher avoids these restrictions, instead opting for total freedom for the player to go wherever they would like.

However, the game isn’t perfect. My main complaint regards the inventory system which limits the player to only four different types of items. At first, this system works great and, I imagine, as intended. By limiting the player to four items, you are constantly returning to the ranch to unload and are thereby given a reason to return, check up on your slimes, and do other rancherly duties. But as the game progresses and the ranch becomes harder and harder to return to, this limitation becomes more and more tedious. Again, at first, this annoyance is ameliorated by the ability to construct teleporters, which allow the player a host of new movement options, connecting together previously disconnected parts of the world, but where the cracks really begin to show is with the slime science system.

I like the slime science system. It adds a great level of complexity to the game without being obtrusive. It allows the player such things as automation and about a hundred other timesavers. But, the resources that you need for slime science are in hard to reach places and, also, multitudinous. With the strict limit of four different inventory slots, it becomes very difficult to harvest your slime science extractors (drills, pumps, and apiaries). Each one of these can spit out three or four different items and, if trying to harvest multiple types, your inventory will quickly be at full capacity. What this leads to is numerous trips back and forth to the ranch just to pick items up off the ground. Eventually, yes, there are ways around this. The player can place Warp Depots every time they harvest their extractors, but the whole system is clunky to manage.

Still, even though I have gone on about it, this problem, and any others the game may have, are little more than a momentary inconvenience. Slime Rancher is still a great game. Even if it has a couple rough edges, a bit too much repetition, and a little too much disconnectedness between its DLC areas (Mochi’s Manor, Ogden’s Retreat, etc. . . ), it makes up for these flaws with its addictive gameplay loop, adorable design, and well-thought out system of slime fusions which give the player endless combinations to try. It is a farming-sim game with little farming, a lot of exploring, and nothing at all which breaks the cozy atmosphere. A great experience and a great time.


Completionist Information: (Difficulty – 5/10)(Fun – 7/10)(Time: 25-35 hours)

Slime Rancher has few difficult achievements. You will have to do everything in the game, catch every slime, go to every location, and deep dive into slime science and all that it entails, but none of this is challenging or overly time consuming. The game also has a story, which while it can be mostly ignored, needs to be completed for achievements. However, this task should be easily completable during normal gameplay.

The hardest achievements in the game are those relating to Rush Mode, a secondary mode which you will be required to play through where the player is given a time limit to collect as much money as possible. There are some nuances and a guide is recommended, but I was able to beat the challenge on my first attempt without too much trouble and maybe a half hour of planning. 

Overall, a fun game to complete as completion mainly consists of beating the game fully. As the gameplay is fun, I thought completing the game was fun also.",1688411539,1688411539,True,23,0,0.750576019287109375,0,True,False,False

Now I spend all day picking flowers and cuddling slimes instead of crushing skulls!
Slime Rancher gets the Chad McMuscles stamp of approval…and maybe a smooch for them cutie slimes <3 And if any of you dirtbags diss my squishy friends, you'll be eatin' knuckle sandwiches for dessert!!!

It didn't look like that much fun while watching streamers play it, but after getting it anyway I had a blast.

Not much thought required, savegames are optional (not much stuff goes wrong), and you can play at your own pace, trying to get everything perfect first try, or muddle on through. When stuff goes wrong, it usually involves slimes being funny, and then it's more fun to make the slimes behave than to reload a savegame.

This game is better even than Slime Rancher 2 (which I haven't played), because it comes with a native LINUX build (engine is Unity3D), which - as seems to be the norm with Unity3d - runs flawlessly on Linux. Even with a 10+yo OpenGL 4.3 AMD graphics card.
So the resource requirements are low, and the fun factor is high. Loved it.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Some achievements, particularly the rush mode ones, can be challenging but rewarding. If you're looking for a delightful break from your daily routine and love cute creatures, Slime Rancher is a must-play game in the farming sim genre.

The simplicity can sometimes be frustrating. I wish there was more to do, and I wish there was the ability to expand a bit. There's very little by way of artistic freedom; you don't get to choose the layout of your ""farm"" and everything looks the same. Exploring can also be a chore. ""Fast Travel"" isn't unlocked until very late game, and by that time it's not worth it because there's no reason to continue exploring.

Reeeeally good game. Great graphics, at least for the time it was made plus it's still getting updates which is real cool too. (SPOILER ALERT DON'T READ NEXT PART UNLESS YOU HAVE PLAYED THE GAME OR DON'T CARE FOR THE PLOT OK READ ON IF YOU ACCEPT THESE CONDITIONS)  Can be a tearjerker if you actually follow along with the story, though I kinda wish there were a alternate ending where you can go home to earth and go live out the rest of your life with Casey.

They haven't even raised the price after it went out of beta. They only released a single, cosmetic DLC the entire time. And they even made a sequel.

In a community choked with toxic devs who abandon games, nickle and dime you with DLC on games not even out of beta, charge full price for pre-alpha builds, turn promised free content into paid DLC, remain alpha builds even when ""v1.0"", and generally just do a trashy job of it, this game is a breath of fresh air.

I started playing this game back when it was in early release on the xbox and have sunk so many hours into this game both on and off steam. One of my favorite games for sure.

This game is a good mix of soft vibes, cute aesthetics, and chaotic shenanigans. The sound track is gorgeous and the story is so heartwarming and wholesome.
It is so hard to not be happy while playing this game.

Game play is smooth and the controls/mechanics are simple to learn and understand. You don't need lots of skill to play so it is a good game to play to rewind. Although, you can spend some extra time learning about the plort market (like a stock market) to create the most income.

If you want, you can even play the rush mode which gives you a certain amount of in-game days to create the most money possible. Personally, I never played this mode but for those speedsters I can see the appeal.

Be sure to check out Slime Rancher 2!!! As I write this it is currently in early access and is incredibly fun!

Slime Rancher [b]holds a special place in my heart[/b] as my all-time favorite game. Its delightful world, endearing characters, and addictive gameplay have enchanted me from the very beginning. This charming gem has a way of whisking players away into a whimsical universe where slimes reign supreme, and the joy of exploration knows no bounds.

One of the most captivating aspects of Slime Rancher is its vibrant and imaginative setting. The Far, Far Range is a stunning and colorful landscape filled with unique and adorable slimes of all shapes, sizes, and personalities. From the mischievous Tabby Slimes to the adorable and bouncy Phosphor Slimes, every encounter with these gelatinous creatures is a source of wonder and delight. The attention to detail in the game's art style is remarkable, with lush environments and cleverly designed structures that bring the world to life.

The gameplay in Slime Rancher is addictively satisfying. As a slime rancher, your mission is to capture slimes, nurture them, and collect their precious plorts. The mechanics of feeding and corralling these squishy critters are simple to grasp but offer depth and complexity as you dive deeper into the game. The management aspect of the ranch, from building new structures to upgrading equipment, provides a sense of progression and constant discovery. With each new slime species discovered, you'll find yourself eager to expand your ranch and uncover the secrets hidden within the Far, Far Range.

One of the standout features of Slime Rancher is its emphasis on exploration and discovery. The world is teeming with hidden treasures, secret areas, and elusive slime types waiting to be found. Venturing into unexplored territories and stumbling upon rare slimes or hidden resources is an exhilarating experience that rewards curiosity and perseverance. The feeling of stumbling upon a new discovery or unlocking a previously inaccessible area is incredibly rewarding and fuels the desire to continue exploring every nook and cranny of the Far, Far Range.

Beyond its captivating gameplay, Slime Rancher also boasts a heartwarming narrative that adds depth to the overall experience. As you progress through the game, you'll uncover the mysteries of the world and encounter memorable characters who bring the story to life. The subtle messages of friendship, perseverance, and the importance of preserving nature are beautifully woven into the game's narrative, creating an emotionally resonant experience that goes beyond mere gameplay mechanics.

Lastly, the developers of Slime Rancher have consistently supported the game with updates and additions, demonstrating their commitment to the community and the longevity of the game. Their dedication to listening to player feedback and implementing new features has fostered an active and passionate community that continues to thrive.

In conclusion, Slime Rancher is a captivating and charming adventure that has captured the hearts of players around the world, including mine. Its vibrant world, addictive gameplay, and memorable characters make it an unforgettable experience that I keep returning to time and time again. Whether you're a fan of exploration, adorable creatures, or simply seeking a game that exudes joy and wonder, Slime Rancher is an absolute must-play. Prepare to be enchanted by its whimsical charm and embark on a journey that will leave you with a permanent smile on your face.",1685946195,1685946195,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Gameplay- 10/10
Slime Rancher, from the beginning, offers you an adventure in the vast area called the Far, Far Range, where, though never in person, you meet other ranchers that have destined their life to this calling themselves. Though simple mechanics, it offers a beautiful sense of calming loneliness.
You learn to ranch slimes, market off of their plorts, advance your gardens and coops, as well as corrals.
If wanted you can also utilize the Range Exchange, where you can help previously aforementioned ranchers with things they're lacking, in return you get a reward, whether it be money, plorts, fruit and veggies, or different assorted chickens, they always pay you back.
As the game progresses you help certain Ranchers with things that have caused them problems, or just mean a great deal. I won't spoil who you help, as I'd love for you to see it for yourself.
You can also keep in check with someone back on Earth through Emails, as well as the Ranchers, or the 7ZEE Rewards Program(Sign up for it, don't miss out).
Emails are useful in many different ways and open up the second part of my review, the story.

-The Story- 10/10
One of the main people you get emails from is someone back on Earth named Casey. It reveals things of the character you play as, who they are, and their values. It makes you feel as if you're on a personal connection with the character.
Another character you get to grow a personal connection with is Hobson, someone who you never see in person yet you learn every step of his beautiful life on this ranch you now own through markers he left on his leave.
I cry easily, so take this lightly if you'd like, but reading the end of Hobson's journey absolutely made me cry. Happy tears of course, I loved finally knowing peace on how he ended his journey just to start it again, it was so utterly beautiful. Just like the graphics, which I will get onto now.

-The Graphics and their Cleanliness.- 10/10
With some games, people with laptops may not always be able to play due to the demanding graphics, even on their lowest setting, and then sometimes if you lower the settings of a game, you can't even recognize the game you're playing.
I can rightfully say that Slime Rancher had mastered the constant of their graphics. You never feel out of sense, never feel like you're missing out, and it's still the same beautiful game. Seriously, the Mosaic slimes are still GORGEOUS on the lowest of graphics, applause to the team on this one.

-My Final Thoughts.-
Slime Rancher is an adventure I'd never want anyone else to miss out on, so please bring yourself to the Far, Far Range, share it's happiness and maybe even it's tears, or fear if we're talking about Tarr Slimes.
This game is worth it. You never truly lose any of that 20 dollars. Never. You earn it all back in beautiful story, well-made graphics, and fun gameplay that you could play for hours without getting bored.

He spent a few more minutes convincing me, though, and I agreed to check PSN for the game. Sony had just rolled out the Extra and Premium tiers of their PS+ program, so I gave the game a try since it was free. A month later, I had the platinum trophy.

Due to life circumstances, I've been shifting a lot of my gaming activity back to Steam this year. I've been downloading old games I used to play (Puzzle Pirates? Memoir '44 Online? Blasts from the past!), resetting passwords for old accounts, and keeping an eye on game series I know I enjoy to grab on sale (Yakuza). I was more interested in buying Slime Rancher 2 than the original because of my platinum trophy, but I happened to catch the game on sale for a great price. I had plenty of funds in my Steam wallet, so I grabbed it. A month later, I've 100% completed the game again. I never finished all 57 achievements on the PlayStation 4 version (I believe there are only 33 trophies or so), so I've been very focused on finishing the achievements that I didn't unlock in my previous playthrough.

Simply put: this game is fun. The visuals are cute, colorful and stunning. Transitioning from the Dry Reef to Indigo Quarry, from Moss Blanket, to Ancient Ruins is beautiful, as each area has its own distinct feeling through artwork. I doubt this is the case, but some of the graphics seem almost hand-drawn and painted with water color, lending to the ""cute and cuddly"" aesthetic the game puts forth. The futuristic appeal is also driven home, by the ever present HUD with your vac pack, storage tanks, and easily accessed Slimepedia.

The music is charming and quirky, and it's very relaxing. I'm planning to purchase the soundtrack at a later date, and I'm looking forward to Slime Rancher 2's soundtrack. Again, each area has its own distinct feel, from the melancholy foreboding of the Glass Desert, to the jaunty almost sea shanty in the Far, Far Range. The music is rounded out by some stellar sound effects: each slime makes cute noises, each rarity has its own indicator, and teleporters and vac'd slimes just sound satisfying.

The controls are great. I played both the PS4 version and the Steam version with a PS4 controller, and the only issue I noticed was more of a Windows issue. I'd occasionally forget to plug in my controller before launching the game, so doing so would transfer the sound to the controller as if it were a headset. I'd have to minimize the game, go to setting and fix it, and then I'd have some weirdness with the menu afterward. Relaunching the game always fixed this, though.

Overall, I'm hoping to have the cashflow to purchase the sequel soon, and I'm excited to see what Monomi Park does with the series in the future.",1685227369,1685227369,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

slime rancher is, at its core, a tycoon-adventure game. if you don't like tycoons, you probably won't like this game either. collecting and selling ports, then upgrading your farm and your character are all integral to game progression. you're not sitting and waiting for plorts to spawn, though - usually you'll be out exploring the island and discovering more and gathering resources; while you're away, your slimes will eat the food you left in their corals, and you'll come back to plenty of plorts to sell. there's a couple minigame-type things, too - those are later in the game, though, and i don't know how to block things to avoid spoilers, so you'll have to take my word for it that they're alright. they help unlock some additional space, which can be really helpful if you want more farms n slimes n stuff.",1684872716,1684872716,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Slime Rancher is a superbly well-written exploration adventure of a young rancher who leaves Earth on a thousand-light-year journey to a strange land but develops a keen understanding of love, loss, life and death as she explores the land of Far, Far Range.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You experience this journey as Beatrix LeBeau, who is a would-be slime rancher arriving on the Far, Far Range after a thousand-light-year voyage from Earth.

Throughout the game, as you progress across the many biomes available to explore, you start to receive mail from her love interest back on Earth, named Casey, who begins to tell you a story of their time together and what ultimately provoked Beatrix to leave.

To contrast the above obviously doomed-to-fail love story of Beatrix and Casey, you discover messages left behind by Hobson, the former owner of Far, Far Range, that tell you his tale of saying goodbye and how he fell in love and where that all eventually guided him.

Slime Rancher warmed my heart and provoked thoughts of a brighter tomorrow. These emotions have been harder and harder to experience in the past few months and to travel on this journey just when I needed it was simply sublime. The writing is impeccable, and the messages are meaningful, with pacing that ensures you are calm and relaxed the entire way through.

[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]
[b]Exploration, but with a twist.[/b]
Slime Rancher isn't a simple farm game. At its very heart, it is built around exploration and discovery. Equipped with your all-purpose tool, the Vacpack, you will be required to bring back all sorts of things from all corners of the Range and use them to upgrade your farm. These can vary from slimes of all kinds to plorts (the reason you farm slimes at all) and even raw materials you will need to complete science experiments and construct gadgets.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2879323871

The vacpack only has four slots, but these slots are upgradeable and can store more of each item as you progress, but again only four items total, ever. Running out of space can be frustrating as there can be quite a considerable distance between the start and end of the game, and running out of room can become quite a time-consuming venture.

[b]Something strange in your neighbourhood.[/b]
The entire reason anyone would want to farm slimes is because of a thing called Plorts. Plorts are shiny shards that resemble the slime they come from that are generated when a slime has been fed food within its diet.
These can then get traded on the ranch for profit, and thus the life of a slime rancher begins.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2879324385

The further away from the ranch you travel, the more rare and valuable the slimes you discover will be, so travelling is more than just for exploration it will also help you actually progress the campaign and improve your ability to make money.

On top of the already significant abundance of slimes in the game, you have the opportunity to create hybrid slimes called Largos. These are formed when a regular slime of any type eats a plort of a different slime, it will then become the hybridisation of the plort it ate and its original form. This is a great way to farm multiple plort types in a single pen.

[b]A farmer's life for me.[/b]
Living on Far, Far Range is more than just exploration and farming slimes, it is about science, experimentation and creativity. Almost every facet of the farm is amendable, which allows you to choose where you place your crops, and pens are entirely up to you. You can make your farm as pretty as a picture or as efficient as a factory floor. The choice is entirely your own.

This is further progressive by unlocking different inventions through scientific discovery once you open the lab on the ranch. You quickly begin to utilise your materials in new and interesting ways and improve your quality of life immeasurably through the use of gadgets that you can place across your farm.

[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]
Slime Rancher did not just captivate me with its incredible storyline and charming gameplay. It resonated through my entire being with its stunning art style that seemed to only deepen in complexity as the story drove onward. With every new awakening of the plot, the world would change to encompass it.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2879323812

This is entirely true of the soundtrack, as it evolves in perfect symbiosis with the story and biome transition. How the music plays with your emotions and unfurls upon the new realms of exploration is simply magical. Unfortunately, the animation sounds and overall atmospheric audio lacks any diversity.

[h1]PC Performance and Specifications[/h1]
I did not see my framerate dip below 60 FPS for the whole campaign with settings as high as they go at 2560 x 1440 resolution.

[h1]Final Thoughts - Excellent[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]
A near-perfect score. This game absolutely blew me away beyond expectation and beyond reason. This game is more than just a game. It is a genuine experience that has changed the way I see lots of things in my life, and I sincerely hope I can hold onto this feeling for as long as I can. Slime Rancher is a must-play experience regardless of price.

The game's graphics are simple, with a magical aesthetic that is both immersive and enchanting. The game's design and animation are top-notch and will captivate anyone who loves visually stunning games.

Another great aspect of Slime Rancher is the open-world aspect of the game. The game is expansive, and offers players a lot of freedom and flexibility to explore, experiment, and ultimately create their custom ranches, which adds an element of creativity to the gameplay.

The game's soundtrack is also worth mentioning as it is perfectly suited to the game's whimsical and engaging atmosphere. The game's background music, coupled with its graphics and fun gameplay, creates an enjoyable experience.

You are a farmer on an alien planet at the Far, Far Range growing slimes - their produce is valuable so if you take good care of them, you earn a lot of money. You can then use that to upgrade your farm, getting better slimes and earning more valuable resources. It's a simple game loop similar to the countless other farming games. The difference is that it's in 3d and you can cross breed your slimes to earn even more money (but if you push too hard the slime becomes a monster so you want to avoid that). 

Now every slime has a food category is OK (vegetables, fruit, meat) but there is also a particular food for most slimes that they really like. If you feed them this, they give even more produce. You can expand your farm and soon after you need to do this, because the more of the same resource you sell on the market the less you get returned. It's nothing too complicated (not like Satisfactory or Factoria etc.) and at first it gives a nice challenge.

[H1]The good[/H1]
It's super cute and the initial gameplay loop is addictive. The level design is good with enough distinctive features that you will recognize quickly where you are. I hardly had to use the map. 

At the start it's a nice chill experience - it's one of those games that if you need to wind down it's there for you. 

I like that you can cross breed the slimes into newer ones. 

[H1]The not so good[/H1]
I did not finish Slime Rancher (at least I did not make it to the credits because there is no real ending). After the honeymoon period wears off (the phase of discovery what each slime can do and what upgrades there are and exploring the five areas): the game transforms into a tedious grind. 

You build single use machine with a chance to get rare resources of which you need many to get the next machine. All the while your farm has expanded to the point that half of the day is spend keeping your slimes fed. There are some mini quests that all need just resources so they give more resources. 

You are punished for willing to produce a lot as there are hard limits on the amount of machinery you can have at any time and they only produce items after 12 minutes (real life time). It is a mechanism that many mobile games use. There is no explanation why you can only use six machines. I wish we could automate all the things but it would mean that at one point the game or the farm would take care of itself and you discover that there is not so much endgame.

At that point I was pondering: am I still having fun? And I wasn't: the machines were just temporary things and then I had to rebuild over and over again: finding the resources, putting them in the refinery, getting the machine, placing it, run it for 12 minutes only to discover I didn't get the rare material I needed and then realising I had to go through this loop again. 

[SPOILER]To enter new areas wasn't particular fun: just find the big slime, figure out the favourite food and give 25 - 50 of those: more grinding. [/SPOILER]

The graphics are pretty basic - it's OK though as the gameplay and the cuteness factor works really well though.

The music is forgettable. 

I wish we could click away the permanent message that Slime Rancher 2 is out. I understand the devs are excited, but I don't need to see it permanently on the main menu.

[H1]Bug and glitches[/H1]
I experience one glitch where the tutorial to the laboratory would not disappear for 20 minutes covering 25% of the screen.

[H1]The DLCs[/H1]
The DLCs are mostly cosmetics - some are for free. They are not game changing and not essential: more meant to support the developer. They look cool and I can recommend them.

[H1]Summary[/H1]
Slime Rancher starts strong and the cuteness factor is its selling point. When this wears off, you realise that to keep you longer in the game you will need to grind a lot. The rewards to expand, to discover new things and to improve are limited. 

I know it’s a completely different genre but I felt like when I entered mid game Elite: Dangerous. There is no real progress it takes your time to not achieve much if anything at all. The way how you harvest on day 1 will be the same on day 100. There is some automation but even after that there is a lot of micromanagements. And to get to automation you have to do more grinding. 

Despite being super cute I cannot recommend Slime Rancher if you plan to spend more than a couple of hours on it.

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I'm back. i now have over 50 hours in the game. and that is just on one save. i have unlocked all of the 7zee rewards and look to get all of the acheivements. i still have yet to play slime rancher 2 but love this game so much. i can spend hours in it doing random stuff like unlocking the expansion people and fabricating more slime science gadets. id reccomend starting with this game first and though this game is several years old it is still a really fun game.,1661037262,1683487793,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For me ""Metroidvania"" basically means spending all your time looking for the fun challenges as you deal with the least fun challenge of all: getting lost, over and over in an unfamiliar place.

This game probably isn't technically what an expert would class as a Metroidvania but it does give you a particular relationship with a location and a landscape: it rewards exploration in which certain resources are immediately abundant but more covetable ones are naturally more scarce. You have places you can explore but it's never challenging to get back home (thank goodness) as you venture out little by little from your central hub. In this game you don't have to *grind* you just have to persevere and then one accumulation of wealth enables you to work more efficiently as you exponentially eliminate that grunt work. The grunt work is part of it though, as your upgrades give you incrementally increasing mastery of the landscape until you're literally soaring above it. It's an empowering experience.

It's not really about the slimes; it's about the vacuum pack. Yes, principally this is a farming simulator but with a dynamism as you whisk up those little guys (or any other item), it's as fun as it looks in the trailer.

Aesthetically adorable as you find new slimes in new locations, there is a darker layer beneath the surface; both the pathos of individuals searching the life they think is for them and also the sheer brutality of agriculture. They don't beat you over head with it but you have the choice of whether you kill or indeed run the farm vegan. I'm not a vegetarian but I liked doing what it took to not have to kill those chickens because I cannot taste them from where I'm sitting. Also remember that you are literally doing all of this for excrement. They look like jewels but that's part of the fun.

Though it can feel like something of a slog at times (you get into a routine of farming and think ""is there anything more?""), I am not saying this doesn't need a few peeks at a walk through. But once I had laid just a basic foundation I was itching daily to apply my plans to run my farm as I wanted.

It is a game of exploration, resource management and physicality as you time your jumps over large distances and engage in combat against tarrs and ferals.

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1682451263,1682451263,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Early game it can be pretty slow, but if you know what your doing you can progress fairly quick. I like the different minigames and the areas the minigames eventually unlock. I do wish there was more to do after you pretty much complete everything, personally I've unlocked all the minigame areas, completed the slimepedia, and explored everywhere. I am excited to eventually get slime rancher 2 and play that but for now I have this. Its a relaxing game with cute slimes and lots to do, but once you do everything there really isn't much to do other than just grind plorts or make a new save file. All in all I give it a 8.8/10",1682443663,1682443663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
