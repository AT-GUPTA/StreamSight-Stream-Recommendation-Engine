It's very easy to set up. You attach it to your Twitch account and then set it up as a Game Window in your OBS software. Then ... you're done!

The cons is that it does limit you in how much avatar space you can use with their addon window, but you can bypass that with getting a free website and dumping a copy of all the avatars on there, then give your viewers a link to see them.

Unfortunately, this does not work without further ado - the hint that it is best to install the software on another account is only very small under the system requirements. You just can not play software and a game at the same time.
Steam could allow here so many alternatives for the software, so that it is not so complicated:
Variant 1: Allow software + games at the same time - It's not like you use 2 games at the same time.
Variant 2: Allow family sharing for the software
Variant 3: Allow transfer of the software (it's not a game) to another account
Variant 4: Allow refund, if you already point out that you want to buy it on another account
But no - Steam (Valve) is stubborn and does not allow refunds. Then I just can't buy games on Steam anymore and have to switch to Amazon, Epic, XBox.
really too bad


In German:
Die Software ist echt klasse und ich habe die Software wunderschön nutzen können, als ich Epic Games Spiele oder Xbox/Microsoft Spiele gespielt habe. Sobald man aber Steam Spiele spielen will, bekommt man die harte Realität vor Augen.
Den das funktioniert leider nicht ohne Weiteres - der Hinweis das man die Software am besten auf einem anderen Account installiert, steht nur ganz klein unter den Systemvoraussetzung. Den man kann halt nicht Software und ein Spiel gleichzeitig spielen.
Dabei könnte Steam hier so viele Alternativen für die Software erlauben, damit es nicht so kompliziert ist:
Variante 1: Software + Spiele gleichzeitig zulassen - Es ist ja nicht so das man 2 Spiele gleichzeitig nutzt
Variante 2: Family Sharing für die Software zulassen
Variante 3: Übertragung der Software (Es ist ja kein Spiel) an einen anderen Account zulassen
Variante 4: Rückerstattung zulassen, wenn man schon drauf hinweist das man es auf einem anderen Account kaufen will
Aber nein - Steam (Valve) ist bockig und lässt keine Rückerstattung zu. Dann kann ich halt keine Spiele mehr bei Steam kaufen und muss auf Amazon, Epic, XBox ausweichen.

As always comments are turned off to prevent trolls and
 reviews are updated as updates come out or i play more.> 

No, i will not be recommending this. Due to false advertising/documentation

The main reason i got this game was to utilize the custom insert-your-own pixel art.
Now i was sorely disappointed.

1: The UI is overly complicated and 2 hard 2 learn.
( they didn't take a single visual person into consideration when designing it)
its entire text box form based.( no visual preview of what the boxes for settings do: clarified)

2: Their entire advertising states you can include your own custom avatars/ bosses and equip-able's
yet they have no pixel art avatar/boss/ item tool design tool/ drawing art program/ plug in for say gimp. included in their application
you have to not only have complete expertise in their way of avatar/ boss design, PNG paneling, program naming, etc.
which means understanding their text-based instructions
( which don't work for graphic design,  like ever) Or badly done hard-to-follow videos.
FACT: You have to download and install a 3rd party application and 
then try to figure out how to get your PNG files to work with their code( read clarification)

that for me (sensory and brain process overload to clarify) is way too much work, time, and effort.

( also an impossible task to do since I'm a very visual/ auditory/hands-on learner/artist type)
( this game should have its own character design software OR 
(plugin template with say gimp to clarify) within the game or listed in gimps plug-ins.
For me, this was a waste of the money I paid for it.

Also if you read the updated documentation:
they actually do state and imply/ infer that stream avatars have it's own creation software now installed, but it's nowhere to be found. the devil is in the details and wording.
(clarified:
 i did watch all the videos I could find on this after purchase, 
they were useless to my brain's ability to learn)

SINCE THE DEVELOPER RESPONDED LET ME UPDATE AND CLARIFY>
CLARIFICATION*

Take these FREE and budget friendly for everyone:
art programs IN GAME DESIGN/ ART DESIGN:
BLENDER: 
NOT EASY to use> 14 million complaints about UI learning/ compat- ability from the autism community alone.( coders refuse to update past 1990's early 2000's mentality)

Avatars and content are often not compatible with game design programs like unreal engine or unity and require extra work and knowledge to correct them for games.
( most games use these{ they also have about 14-28 million complaints about  the user interface and learnability on non-official forums{just the autism-based creators){ unreal 5 addressed many of them so I will give them that)

Gimp/Inkscape:  ( mostly 2d related to games and content creation)
while the program UI is completely autism-friendly, it sorely lacks the tools needed.
PNG texture files for things like a blender, unreal engine, 2d/ 3d avatar design import/export, UV map design, and game character skin design/ texture tools are not present or have easy-to-find plugs in to compensate.

Now as for the UI:
 when I say a visual game design UI.

think of it like this>
 if it looks like a government form or job application. it may overload the autism-based brain.

Take an example I found in the UI.
Referencing settings(general) and (avatars and gears)

You have a preview of avatars and gear.
( you actually already have everything you need to set up for visual 
 the UI just has to be changed to split screen preview) 
now if I'm looking at the UI  full out I instantly get a migraine.
but take who can drop in. (I had to collapse all other boxes to not cause a migraine to give example)
if you had a picture (gif preview)  of say an avatar spawning next to the text box that would be less overloading to the brain (for those who are visual and can't do government-type forms or even job applications)

""Nor a TTF text editor. "" okay clearly another coder who doesn't understand fit to use by everyone and anyone principal ( blender has this mentality and its the reason they have 145 million complaints worldwide by the disabled art community alone) or 
 the people downloading this and using this barely have a good education( fit for the modern world or art design) let alone a coders 101 course 
(which I failed part of btw because I'm an extremely visual and auditory learner.
 for example, this, in order for me to code or read it. it would have to be

SOURCE (code result)    CODE
  ""This is the blue text""     <body>
                                        <p style=""color:#0000FF"";>""This is the blue text""</p>
                                         </body>.
as a visual side by side by with the code( highlighted  code segment and final product
 is shown as an example)

SO Let me put this as simply as possible you are a game.
1: Your game menu should be as simple and usable as possible so as to not overload anyone
with say just a 5th-grade education
2:  if you boast character design in any way you should never require anyone
to have to use an external program that straight up refuses to accommodate every person
(like Blender, audacity, and unity)>

which means having your own character designer even if it's just simply a plug-in template you gave to gimp and told the user hey we don't have our own art program but we supplied an easy-to-use  prefabricated template plugin to ( insert name of favorite art program 1free and 1 paid here) gimp, 
which will allow you to have  an easier time correctly setting up your costume game components

most coders just give a  code file (apk/plug-in)  to 3rd parties, like blender and unity, (which i hate because they are not User Interface friendly at all), gimp( which is 98% user-interface friendly). photoshop( which is not budget friendly at all)",1673462778,1673672832,False,2,1,0.448009580373764038,0,True,False,False

And when they behave I place them on my head (I'm a VTuber and I built an invisible platform above me so it looks like my viewers walking on my head hahaha). They love it so much they ask me to place their avatars on my head all the time hahaha. When I streaming games I pin avatars above my HP bar and ask them to watch my health closely and tell me when it goes down, or I could pin them on the minimap and ask to watch when enemies approach. I set up the bot to spam commands !boss and !battleroyale every 30~90 minutes and my viewers love those minigames, they love to participate in boss battle and commenting on battle royale and they are so happy when they winning.

I can't imagine my streams without avatars. 10/10 best app in the world.

If you are a streamer, this is a NEED.
It was so fun debuting this on stream and having my chat interact with it. The mini games are a delight, and I love seeing all these little people dance on my screen!
I do think the UI could do with a nicer little upgrade. It was a bit difficult at first to understand everything. Additionally, I would love if I could grant certain users (Or just chat overall) the ability to start minigames. They really enjoy them, and I don't mind them playing on repeat, it's just a bit of a hassle to go and start them myself all the time. Lastly, a bit more help with creating your own avatars would be great! I bought a pixel art program alongside this, so hopefully that will help, but there are definitely some quality of life things that can be changed up with Stream Avatars.

So you're a streamer and you're either new, or been here a long while and want some engagement. This is perfect for both situations. Got a friend or two that likes a few anime characters? Boom, they can have their little guy talking on your screen, they can hug you, buy bombs for the heck of it, and yeet people just cause. You can limit how many people spawn at once, you can limit that they have to be a follower or subscriber, there's so much you can customize.

Speaking of customization.. it's all in your hands, literally! What characters are installed, backgrounds, bosses, etc! All can be found in the workshop by so many lovely creators. Even things you'd think wouldn't be in there, it's there(maybe). 

The ONLY downside to this program I've experienced is with heavy load games it lags ya a bit without the best PC. I have quite the tank, but I can't use it when I play Cyberpunk 2077 on Ultra, for example. So be weary that if you'd like to use it with a heavy game, be sure to lower graphics of both the program and the game, and all will be fine!

TLDR; If you're a streamer and you're looking for engagement or fun stuff to do with your chat, this is perfect for you.",1669614444,1669614444,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm having a HUGE problem with Stream Avatars. *** PLEASE MAKE SOFTWARE FAMILY FRIEND *** We're a team specialized in Virtual Reality games broadcasting for more than 8 hours every single day since Jan/1st/22 to over 20 different platforms in Mixed Reality using Artificial Intelligence to calibrate and capture all the interactions in Real Time. All games and rendering processes are done using a RTX4090 in Real 4K UltraHD 3840x2160 60FPS with a enormous live bit rate 25,000 Kbps, also recording everything in 100,000 Kbps. So, to achieve the best quality possible, a way better than a Hollywood Studio, we use 5 machines in our process. And the problem about STREAM AVATARS is that it was bought for this account. But we use different computers, and the computer with this account has to run the games and all necessary apps. This computer will NEVER run Stream Avatars. So, when I try to run Stream Avatars on the second computer, if I use the same Steam account where I bought it, it logs me out of first computer. And if I use family share on the second computer, it doesn't allow me to run the Stream Avatars. The point is, I paid for the software, I want to play games in one computer, and I want to use STREAM AVATARS in a second computer, it doesn't matter if it's in my account or in other.

It's a shame you're at the mercy of the Workshop to offer great sprites (there are a few great ones and a lot of lacklustre ones) and as someone with no pixel art skills or a lot of spare money, I can't make or commission my own custom sprites. 

I doubt more Minigames are in the works but I'd love to see more games where the viewers are involved with their avatar. Jump Rope or a collect as many objects in a timeframe to win (with positive and negative modifiers dropping) would be one that could implement the Jump feature.
An updated/additional Battle Royale where viewers can drop bombs and issue targets to attack would be amazing.

It does pretty much everything it says on the box but setup and customization can be quite time consuming and I feel like a lot of the additional features (such as gambling, b-ball, boss fights, ect) just go underused and unappreciated. 

There's also kind of an on-boarding process that needs to be done like a rite of passage just so your viewers know all the things they can do with it. 

It's still a cool little thing to have because, despite these growing pains, you can kinda take control yourself and do things like assign avatars and nameplates to highlight your moderators and/or regular viewers. Plus, sometimes it's the only way I know **who** is watching when I use OBS (because OBS will tell me how many people are there but not necessarily who).

Pick it up, hit the in-app workshop, and get some avatars to play around with. 
With enough patience and if you're smarter than me (not a very high bar to clear) you'll probably get better use out of it than I do.",1659438942,1659438942,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was so fun debuting this on stream and having my chat interact with it. The mini games are a delight, and I love seeing all these little people dance on my screen! 
I do think the UI could do with a nicer little upgrade. It was a bit difficult at first to understand everything. Additionally, I would love if I could grant certain users (Or just chat overall) the ability to start minigames. They really enjoy them, and I don't mind them playing on repeat, it's just a bit of a hassle to go and start them myself all the time. Lastly, a bit more help with creating your own avatars would be great! I bought a pixel art program alongside this, so hopefully that will help, but there are definitely some quality of life things that can be changed up with Stream Avatars.

Being able to create avatars from other video games and incorporate them in for viewers to use was fantastic. I joined the creators discord for any assistance needed and to report bugs.
BUT!
Ever since their latest update. The program has been unusable, and their discord page no longer active it seems. Every channel in their discord was deleted and the only one left was an announcements channel you could not post into, with no mention as to why the discord was deleted or even why their program as ruined.

All available avatars are now permanently locked to viewers, followers, subscribers and moderators. They are only usable if I remove the price and make them free. Which defeats the purpose of them.
If I give an avatar to someone, the program states it has been gifted but it actually hasn't. The same goes for points to spend on them. If I gift, add or remove points, the program states its worked but really nothing has happened. If I add new avatars, it doesn't save even after refreshing and stating it has saved.

I want to report the issue because the latest update has destroyed the program and made it pointless for me and my channel. But I am unable to anymore. I can't even see if this is a localised issue or is affecting others. When searching online it only gives forums, videos and links from years ago. Long before the update happened.

So now I would no longer recommend this program because for me, its broken. I have no choice but to uninstall and archive it.",1655392442,1655392442,False,7,1,0.581599295139312744,0,True,False,False

Also short cut commands to spawn certain bosses with certain difficulties or exclude them out of certain tiers altogether would be awesome. 

Otherwise.... I don't feel the product really get's a lot of actual updates throughout the years besides just support added for other streaming platforms. I enjoy using this a lot and everything I've made for this program I've done in photoshop using old game assets myself. I haven't uploaded any of my work to the workshop or use any of their work because I like to keep things as original to my channel as possible.

I'd like to see more functionality behind this product besides the things I've rigged together over the years to make it work with my other notifications as I feel it's been one of the most interactive tools I've had with my viewers....just none of them seem to use it anymore aside from the fart and mass bomb commands in the channel point integrations. The boss battles can really unlock a ton more potential if they took it a step further and added systems in place that tracked and kept viewer growth upon completing them.

Some custom reward systems I've been able to make for the avatars:
Non Cosmetic - Dragonballs: Players can win dragonballs through the minigames and display all 7 using the sit command once collected to win free games of their choice.

Cosmetic- Swords(weapons), Pets (pokemon and others) and was thinking about incorperating other things like auras, wings, spell balls, attack glimmers...

There's a lot of possibilities people really don't consider possible with this program. Combining it with other chatbot programs and the possibilities are near endless.

I literally cannot have this open while I stream larger games, serious framerate stutter on twitchy First Person Shooters, that this program somehow manages to take priority to render simple freaking pixel sprites.  
How the hell is this hogging 10% CPU constantly and spiking up to 80% every few seconds??? Mining bitcoin??? It's just freaking 2d pixel sprites, just how, what the hell...
With this I am done, last update I had 47 hours, This review update stops at 135 hours.


Original review and first edit blow:

-It doesn't have proper documentation. 
-Technical difficulties with it's ""API"" system. 
-This software is lacking features and its interface is not intuitive at all. Figuring out literally anything is pure trial and error currently.
-If you need anything more complex than a 2d sprite sheet that walks left and right combined with basic chat-bot functionality then avoid this like the plague. Unless you are an advanced user that knows the code language they are using without a decent documentation...
-Even the enviroment that the avatars walk around is barebones physics that even a gamemaker package out of the box is superior to this garbage.
-The developer neutered possible functionality for twitch to make it equal to every other streaming platform and homogenize how the software works to prevent errors caused by differences in each platform.

+The implementation of steam workshop makes it easy for end users to use pre-made assets.
+Artists might find this cool and able to make their own OCs, maybe even publish on workshop

-I am angry at scripting that I shouldn't need, for something so simple that should have already been part of the base functions.

EDIT after the developer response: 
Don't worry, I'll continue using it and haven't refunded. 
For my needs it is good enough, but I would try to make the avatar-to-enviroment behaviours and interactions a lot more polished, for example adding slopes/ramps instead of relying on ladders, improving physics for falling down and/or having variants of idle avatar AI so you can choose what they would do more often than just random left-right walking aimlessly...",1636416193,1648500567,False,4,0,0.551337778568267822,0,True,False,False

This has been a great tool for me to practice pixel art by making my own avatars, but also for giving me something to talk about on my channel and get viewers involved! 

The ONLY complaint I have is if you are a beginner pixel artist it can be very hard to understand how to import your own and get it set up. Its also diffi ult to understand how to use all of its features, I still cant figure out some of them. Once I finally did that though with importingnit was fine. 

ALSO, it doesn't say what the ""points"" that people rack up go toward. What is the purpose? Can they spend this ""gold"" on something? I wish they could for shop items but I don't know how to do that. 

Anyway this review was worded kind of clunk but just know it's a great tool for your channel, even if you just download others avatar designs instead of making your own

It's a bit pricey compared to other stream extensions and in my opinion should be open source but for now it's the best option of its kind. There's a couple alternatives but Stream Avatars has the most in depth features and customization. You can create or download your own avatar sprites and every user can choose from the pool of characters you create. This can help give viewers an identity in your channel and increase retention. The animations are smooth and the activities are fun. 

I do have a couple grievances though. If you want to add more characters you have to pay an extra 5$. I guess if you use it a lot it could be well worth it but adding a few extra (30!) MB of avatar space as a DLC is a bit shotty. 

Also I ran into some memory performance issues with the client. I'm running in windowed mode set for performance and its still pretty clunky. I've got OBS going, Stream Avatars, Ableton Live, whatever game, sometimes a second game window or a browser with 30 tabs. I'm sure it's to be expected but eventually my computer started locking up - but that's unique to Stream Avatars because I can usually run 2 other games without my system failing. It usually doesn't occur for a few hours though. Until then it's pretty smooth. But going through the menus right now, it's slow and unresponsive. Any tips appreciated.

The initial set up is fairly pain free and adding to your streaming software is fairly simple. Adding to your collection of avatars from the workshop is easy enough and there's a wide variety of content to choose from made by many talented people.

The issues present themselves if you want to go more in-depth. Importing your own avatars can be a real hassle. Even when you have the correct dimensions, Stream Avatars doesn't make it easy to match this in app. The sizing numbers often make little to no sense compared to your PNG spreadsheet that you have set to meet the sizing requirements and this can cause many visual glitches. 
When it works, however, it's a wonderful piece of kit; being able to set custom actions and FPS for each avatar is wonderful and adds to the overall customisation.

Mini-games, mass actions and gold are all here and again, when they work they're incredible. The problem is that they don't work as intended or as often as they should. I've check the Stream Avatars website for various instructions and searched FAQs but there's very little information out there on how to get these things to function correctly. Right now, the only consistent mini-games I have managed to get to work are Boss Fights and Battle Royale.
This may not be a core problem with Stream Avatars and could possibly be down to my short-comings, but clearer instructions in app and on the website would go a long way.

My only other criticisms are with the browser source box and commands for followers. The ability to customise the browser source box should be a staple part of this app. Telling my viewers that if they ""want and avatar? follow or sub"", is not friendly at all. Being able to at the very least be able to customise this message would go a long way. 
Commands are great, however for some reason, certain actions have been locked away for only subscribers to use. I'm pretty sure this never used to be the case, however when I search through the app, I cannot find a way to allow all actions for all followers. This needs to be addressed as soon as possible and if I am being dozy and have missed something, please point me in the right direction.

Overall, Stream Avatars at the very base level is a brilliant piece of software to recognise your viewers, but if you really want to get into the meat and potatoes of the app, you're going to have to do a lot of digging to get the best out of it.

I've lost myself in creating custom avatars since I bought this and it's amazing to see them brought to life by Stream Avatars.
It took a bit of experimenting to figure out the best image resolutions to use since it affects how they appear in the Twitch extension, but I settled for a 64x64 canvas for my items since it appears to give pixels a 1:1 ratio when viewing/equipping them.
For people who don't want to create their own avatars there's countless of avatar packs to download.

I've read some comments saying that the 18mb upload limit is restrictive, but it's not restrictive at all if you apply some common sense with the files you're using. Avatars are generally very small, i've reached 2% upload limit with 41 image files + 5 custom name tags, and that's [b]before[/b] i've bothered to optimize the file sizes (TinyPNG can cut down image size by up to 80% which I plan to do later).",1642745170,1642745170,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

My experience with stream avatars started out bad from the start. Upon first setting up the avatars, it worked right out of the box flawlessly. As I began to play around with it, suddenly my 2nd attempt to render it in OBS failed. The avatars just wouldn't show up for the life of me. So my experience was spending the next 2 hours trying to fix it for my stream. Eventually it worked, but I do not know how or why it worked. So I just went live instead and let my audience play with the avatars.

For the next 2 days, no problems, so I thought my troubles were over. Then on the 3rd day, it just magically stopped working again, but this time I couldn't fix it. So I had to go a entire stream without it and apologize to my audience.

Eventually I went to where I was suppose to go, the stream avatars discord support page and posted my problems. Do you want to know what happened? The developer literally by-passed me and answered other people's questions, who were shorter / smaller in size. Yes, I literally got ignored. 

Therefor, since I gave this developer money and he/she has decided to ignore my support requests, I am giving this a overall negative review and negative experience.

As for the software itself, if you can get it to work, here is what I believe you can expect.

Pros:
Fun eventful avatars running across your screen.
People battling and duel each other.
Boss battles and mini-games for fun.

Everything you would basically come to expect with this software. Here is things you might not have thought of though, for cons.

Cons:
~ Even though sprite sizes are adjustable, if your going to a minamlistic look, they clutter up your screen.
~ Aftertime, the audience grows tired of playing with the avatars and ignores them.
~ Setup is not plug and play.
~ You have 18mb of upload. Some packages in the store are larger than this and you cannot even upload a single package without buying the 30mb upgrade, making it mandatory.
~ You will or will not get help from support. They decided to ignore me.

Take with this information what you will, but this is what I got when I bought stream avatars, and I guess you will have a similar experience. If you read this and its still worth buying, by all means go ahead, but I hope I did my duty in getting the buyer to understand the pitfalls with this software as well. Thanks for reading.

However if you are, I would absolutely recommend it. It's not very expensive and it has a lot of potential for what you can do with it. Even at its most basic form with sprites downloaded from others (free on steam workshop), it's really nice for the people in your chat to come in and see their avatar on the screen and play some of the mini games together.

If you're into making your own sprites, you can customize pretty much everything and make this very personalized. You can customize the avatars, boss, sounds, certain mini game sprites, etc. As someone who gets really into the customization of it all, I LOVE this. 100% recommend to any art streamers to mess around with making your own avatars. The bosses are more complicated to make and quite a lot of work, but if you're up to the challenge it's definitely an option. 

With the shop options, you can actually use this as a replacement for Sound Alerts. You just upload whatever sound file you want and add it into the shop. With everything in the shop (sounds, avatars, avatar accessories, avatar actions, avatar colours, and nametags) you can make it so your viewers can buy it with stream-avatar-earned coins or bits. You can also make it giftable-only if you want to give something special to someone that only they can use. You can also make it so only followers/subscribers/moderators can have certain things. So setting specific avatars/sounds/etc to followers only is really easy! 

Since viewers earn the coins the more time they watch your stream or through participating in games, it's a great way to encourage chat to stay active even when things are maybe going slow in stream. And you can use the avatars and sounds and other things as extra rewards they can get for spending the time in your stream! There's also the leaderboard for ""richest"" viewers, which... some viewers take very seriously 

All in all, whether you're just going to throw it together at the basic settings and let it work for you or get deep into customizing and have some extra fun with it, I think it's absolutely worth the buy if you're looking to add some extra fun to your stream.",1629650939,1629650939,True,9,0,0.6406136155128479,0,True,False,False

This program allows you to link it to your twitch and with a bit of fiddling, people can have avatars! This can be followers, or anyone! (sadly, even bots).

[hr][/hr]

[h1]The Good:[/h1]
- Easy. Mega easy. You load up the program and it's pretty good for beginners because you can just load up any ol' avatar collection. There's not a lot, but the ones they have are pretty good.
These are all set up and ready to go.

- You can add your own art instead, and make your own items for your characters. 
My stream has little cats (stream in profile). I made them myself, changed the colours with the palette editor in the program, and it's randomised when people follow me, everyone who follows gets a cat! That's super fun.

- The users can change the items for free or for fake 'gold' which they earn by watching your stream. You can make a hat cost 0 or 100000x whatevers. I don't really like to limit my watchers, so I just made all my items free, but it's preference.

-  You can have interactions. If you type !jump in the chat, your icon will jump. You can also type in like !fart, !hug, etc. for ...well....you know :P

- Games. This program allows the owner who is broadcasting to throw stars, throw the characters, have boss battles etc. I haven't got boss battles on mine because I haven't been bothered to do it yet, but I'll get there. There's some default bosses you can edit into it so you don't [b]need to do art, but it is super limited if you can't do pixel art.[/b]

[hr][/hr]

[h1]The Bad: [/h1]
- Unfortunately if you don't do pixel art, you wont be completely lost, but it is very limited.
The work they do have is very good though. 

- It's a bit difficult, I struggle a lot with aligning hats and things. Sometimes the item will reset it's positioning, and this causes me pain having to do it over and over again for each item. (I have like 30 hats to choose from, having to position them every time SUCKS, and sometimes they reset for seemingly no reason. 

- Youtube: Good and bad. You can find really good tutorials on Youtube on how to set this up! Its great, but its also like, okay? You need to search to find info on use the program, and it's kind of sad it doesn't have a tutorial or something to give you a basic run down, but it's a program that's not too expensive, so you get what you pay for. It's still really good.",1613763581,1613842023,True,29,0,0.774058401584625244,0,True,False,False

Features:
- Great viewer value: My subscribers get to choose and control onscreen avatars! And yes, I always tell them about the !fart command.
- Battle Royale mode is amazing.
- Turn-based Boss fight mode is amazing.
- Workshop support really makes this stellar.

Usability:
- Powerful (lots of options and features)
- Taking full advantage of all features would mostly benefit advanced users. There's more customization features than I've ever taken the time to really look into and set up!
- I didn't run into any trouble setting it up.
- Very stable. I can't even remember the last time this program crashed.
- CPU/GPU usage - Minimal. I haven't even noticed an impact from the program.

Eager to see more updates to this! 

- Really want more Boss fights / options / create our own! Soon Please!! :P

( ? ) Only thing I wish is that the instructions on using certain things were more clear, for example nametags.. Been trying to set it up so only certain levels of viewers get nametags ie. Viewers / Followers / Subs / VIPs / Mods / Caster (Would like to have the option to spawn nametags to specific groups with these Roles and also assign specific viewers with these Roles manually.

Maybe this can be done already? It's unclear to me as to how?

( ? ) I don't know if it's a Twitch extension limitation or a limitation to this Extension but would love to see increased import storage beyond the 18mbs.

- My last bit of feedback would be to make it easier to uninstall certain mod packs added from the Steam Workshop and an easy way to identify which ones I already downloaded and installed. via the Streaming Avatars App interface.

- Okay one more thing, better ways to sort all the avatars. Theirs the simple drag and drop method currently available but with nearly 9 pages of avatars I'm not even going to try. Having a way to sort everything by Currency Cost or by Workshop Packs would be far more efficient.

After a lot of trial and experimentation these are just a few of the things that really stood out to me that would be great to see in future updates. I do hope this project continues to be worked on, my community really loves it!

- **Update** Tried adding Sound FX to the Mini Games such as Boss, Basketball, Battleroyale and Duel. Theirs overlapping repeating SFX issues with all of them. For Example, for the Battleroyale I added a Plane SFX and then a Game Repeating Sound SFX and everything just loops over and over top each other ( sounds awful ). The Plane SFX should stop when the game battle SFX starts. Having some control over how many times SFX loops and how long the SFX duration should be would be some great additions.

( ! ) Maybe in the future you can add some sort of bounty mini game similar to Streamlabs text based game! <-- Free idea for you guys :P KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!

Streamers can create custom actions for their avatars (aside from the default actions of Idle, Walk, Sit, Stand and Jump) and also create animations to replace the default action animations like !jump and !sit. The only limitation is your creativity. For those that are less than artistic, or don't have time to create their own avatars - The discord and workshop have a large number of pre-made avatars submitted by the community; the software also comes with some pre-made avatars/accessories (gear).

Stream Avatars is easy enough to traverse and the support team in the discord is more than helpful and responsive with any questions users may have. This software is consistently being updated with new features and community content. I HIGHLY recommend this to all streamers looking to add meaningful content to their community.

TLDR: This is a well made tool, still adding a lot of content, good value, very good integration. Must buy for a bit of gimmick in stream!

First off, as you can see, I am rewriting my review of this tool. It is and will every be very very positive.
This tool really has given me so much work! But the good one, the one where you stop everything else. 
It says I've put over 100 hrs into it. I was not configuring it up until the point of this time. 
But rather have I helped fellow users in the very nice and active Discord. I have also made some custom sprites and tested a lot. Basically the time ""played"" reassembles the time I've put into it in playing around it.

Do not get confused or scared off. This tool might be the nicest addition to any stream who likes the gimmicky! The handling is very intuitive, you will get more creative, the community is awesomely nice, helpful, active and very creative itself.

The dev is very active and will even change stuff and fix bugs in merely hours!
This tool is really worth the money and by now 15€ is a very good deal for it!

The development is steady and a lot of suggestions make it into the actual program. 
You can get featured with your creations.
You can use a lot of sprites users want to share for free.

OLD:

Very gimmicky but very very cute piece of software. 
Just implemented it and not knowing alot of it. But my viewers say they love it already. 
Probably customize the sht out of it and designing own sprites for it. 
In its current status not worth 15 bucks, but with the ""planned stuff"" coming totally worth a shot!
I am totally fine paying 12 euros for it and hope for more possibilities and impementations soon ^.^",1501096346,1503311352,True,9,0,0.55687028169631958,0,True,False,False

With transparent mode, the little dudes hardly distract from the game you are playing and chat loves them! I've noticed people sub or follow in stream just to get their own guy on screen :) 

It's usually smooth, and I can't wait to see what gets added! I'm too lazy to make my own avatars, but I hope we get more soon! (+ gear for the bat and bluemon).

Looking forward to support with other streaming services other than just Twitch.

Looking for other avatars? Check out the Artwork channel on the discord server.

Tip? When having the Avatar layer on OBS or Xplist, don't forget to ""Crop"" the top area, otherwise you'll see some unwanted buttons on screen with your stream. haha",1502233385,1502233385,True,2,0,0.524506211280822754,0,True,False,False

Untill most features are released I would not really recommend this program for its price but once all their idea's that they have are in there this program would be the best for any streamer that wants to connect more to their audiance. 

What I stated above in my opinion has changed since the continues Updates and support from the developer. I will not remove it since I want to keep the Review honest and show what it was before and what it is now! Hope my Review Helped you pick this amazing program!

[b]Pros[/b]
+ Does not take allot of CPU to run the program
+ People can show them selves how they like to be on the stream

[b]Cons[/b]
- No user blacklisting feature ([b]Added in recent update V1.25[/b])
- When a viewer leaves the stream it does not remove them from the avatars ([b]Resolved after Developer Response[/b])
- Subscriber mode is only for partner and not for affiliates [b](Added in recent update V1.21)[/b]
- Chat gets very spammy when someone first finds out about the feature on a stream ([b]Resolved as of version v1.28![/b])

Even though i wrote down allot of cons this program is still very good and would 100% recommend it for those who want to see this awesome program evolve",1501143527,1501802742,True,11,0,0.609903991222381592,3,True,False,False

As for setting up, it's real easy. I'm a complete derp but figured it all out pretty fast.

Ran my first stream with the avatars last night and seemed to go down really well. 

Looks like we'll be getting regular updates with new commands/actions which is always a good thing.

There is a Discord channel well worth joining for Stream Avatars being run by Clonze (I think!) where you can get all your questions answered!

All in all this has some brilliant potential to go from a good purchase to a MUST HAVE purchase for Twitch streamers.

And after testing all I can say about it is that it is [b]F*cking legendary[/b], not just because I spend some hours on discord with developer during a release day to help me to make it work but also because it is highly customizable and it can make your stream look more fun to watch.

You can make your own Avatars with animations, items and import it. Make it look to your preferences.
Here is a [url=http://imgur.com/a/SWc6B] GIF [/url] from my stream with my custom imported survivors.

I can only recommend this product to every streamer that is interested about this. Its worth every cent.
