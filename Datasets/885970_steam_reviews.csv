[hr][/hr]
Despite its recent facelift, Rome Remastered is still, at heart, a 17-year-old game. And it shows. 

[b]Gameplay and Challenge[/b]

The old Rome: Total War wasn't popular for nothing; it's gameplay is still very satisfying but unfortunately the Remastered AI can't compensate for 17 years of ageing, so the game is now fairly easy and the AI can be danced around with ease. This definitely cheapens the challenge of the game, and for players more familiar with the newer titles this can be quite jarring. On the whole, though, it's still a blast from the past to play.

[b]Graphics[/b]

The graphics for Rome Remastered have been greatly improved from the original game, but that's not necessarily a good thing; simply put, the graphics aren't good enough to match most modern games but they don't have the aged charm of the old game, leaving the game in a graphical limbo. 

[b]Quality of Life[/b]

The best part about the Remaster. The quality of life has been vastly improved from the old game and everything works like it should. I've not encountered any bugs so far. Furthermore, you get access to both DLCs for the game: Barbarian Invasion and Alexander.

[b]Mods[/b]

It's my personal opinion that Rome's modding community was the best for any game ever relative to it's size. And while the Remaster's is inevitably much shrunken from the old game's hay-day, it's still alive and kicking; already, full overhaul mods are being brought out, and this game's modding scene is only set to grow as time goes on. 

[hr][/hr]
[b]Verdict[/b]

Rome still stands, but not perhaps as gloriously as it once did.

There are four issues that I've found so far that make this game a total dog.

1.  Way too many glitches, freezes,  and crashes.  Most of the information you need to play the game is hidden in pop-up windows or online.  Nothing online works through steam shell so unless you have another device to access that information you have to close the game to get to that stuff.  the rest of the information in the right click boxes is great, but then about 10% of the time that box won't close and no other gui function can be activated.  You can scroll the screen in the background but you can't do anything but ctrl-alt-del and reboot you computer to restore functionality.  I takes a really crap application to make the whole machine unstable.

2.  A.I. pathing and response is ridiculously bad.  An example would be when invading a city, you click to have a unit go down the side street around the perimeter wall.  If you leave that unit unattended and aren't paying attention, there's a good chance that it will go straight to the plaza where the entire enemy army is intending to take another main road from the plaza back to the place right beside where they started that you told them to go to.  Also, at least once in every battle one of your units will do one of the following:  a)run everywhere until exhausted even when told to walk or stand still.  b)  suddenly stop accepting orders and just stand in place, refusing to flee or fight.  c) somehow path inside of the scenery into a position where they can't interact with anyone else on the field.

3.  The game seems to have a lot of memory errors that keep compounding, making the mid to late game a crap shoot as to being able to finish  a campaign.  Not a problem if you never finish the long campaign anyway, but if you want too...

4.  The merchant system.  The whole thing.  It's awful.  IF you can get it to work it adds a whole new strategic layer to your economy.  Just let me warn you about a few things.  1)  The documentation states that your merchant can buy out opposing merchants, THIS IS A LIE!!  Well, not always, but your level 10 merchant has just about a 50/50 shot with A.I. level 6 guys, OR SO THE GAME SAYS!?!?  Getting frustrated, I ran an experiment and reran the same encounter nearly 80 times with different characters.  The result was a 100% fail rate.  I really don't think that the encounter calculator works...at all.

As a bonus, during the speeches before the battles, your commander will always reference that your main goal is to protect the city from the enemy...that belongs to him...that you're assaulting.  Da Fuuuk????",1705906719,1705906719,False,1,0,0.465746670961380005,0,True,False,False

This is more than a simple re-skin. Some core mechanics have been improved like diplomacy which used to be useless in the original. Some buildings and unit stats have been tweaked for balancing and all factions are now playable by default.
Some additional mechanics have also been added. These include the trader agents and the ability to do night battles.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

•	Good performance on modern machines (easy to run with high fps)
•	Modern Total War controls make battles feel a lot less clunky than the original
•	You can now see your income next to the amount of money in the treasury
•	Buildings in settlement battles look much better with modern graphics
•	Buildings that have been constructed in the campaign change the appearance of settlements in the campaign map and battle map
•	Modding support

Cons:
•	Overly complicated and ugly UI that I find frustrating to use
•	Brain dead AI
•	Diplomacy is practically worthless as the AI will constantly betray you
•	The message system in the campaign often fails to notify me of senate missions and other key faction events such as the death of the faction leader, despite the fact I have all message notifications on
•	Small Text on UI is difficult to read, same goes for small mini map
•	Amateur art design I find hard to look at (especially the loading screen pictures and noodle arm legionnaires)
•	Unit skins are a massive downgrade from the original
•	Victory/Defeat music abruptly stops when transitioning from battles to the campaign map
•	Marching sound effects on the battle map have been significantly reduced, therefore neutering the ominous sound of a group of armed men marching off to battle
•	Missile units won’t stop screaming “FIRE” when shooting at the enemy making it hard to hear anything else (present in original but not obnoxiously loud)
•	Missile units keep shuffling forward while firing
•	Cavalry units move a lot slower than in the original
•	Atrocious path finding in settlements
•	The original barely takes up 4GB of storage, this version requires over 70GB of storage

I tried different settings between original and remastered and this made no difference. Took all of the fun out of playing the game when I knew that there's no challenge because the other roman factions just stood around and did nothing for 75+ turns.

But the big let down is the AI. Battles became very stale and boring pretty quickly because the AI is utterly useless, even on hard mode.

Units run in weird directions, often backwards to get around obstacles, charges are broken up weirdly by trees and things, which city fighting is a shambles. Honestly, it kills the game for me.

The original game really was having a hard time running at all during it's last few years and for the most paart the remaster runs pretty smooth. It's fairly solid all across the board and I'd rate it a 6.5/10. maybe a 7 on a really good day compared with an easy 8/10 for the original game.

The more detailed break down is that while i'm grateful that I can, again enjoy playing one of my all time favourite games, the kicker comes in the fact that it just isn't the same as the good ol' days. They've made tweaks that I really like. EG, the diversification of unit colouring is actually a really neat idea and looks really good if you ever look that closely at your units (I do, sometimes). Adds a bit of depth to each unit and one could really take pride in having certain armies coming from certain regions and the effect of recruitment dilusion. When you start recruiting in Africa it really is quite noticeable, in a good way. This was probably just a polite nod to the woke left, but I'd call it an overall good change.

The changes to the UI are fairly hit and miss. Aesthetically speaking I preferred the original ui. It looked a little nicer and it made the whole game feel a bit more immersive. The new UI actually just looks a little too clean, where as when you opened up the OG UI it felt more like reading from an old scroll and it was a little more immersive and fit better with the time setting. On the other hand the changes that were made to UI did also make the UI more functionally efficient and easier to use, in my opinion.

Bug wise, they didn't really do a whole lot with bugs, on the surface. They put an end to scorpions triggering never ending sieges by changing their classification and they also added in a draw option. So battles that became stalemated and are otherwise going nowhere can now be brought to an end without a defeat where we'd normally get a victory and or at least a close fight. Troops can still fumble with ladders pretty well though. They do seem to have really stomped out the issues with units getting stuck on the bottom of siege towers though. That's a huge plus in my view. A few players still have said they have siege tower issues with it but it's more easily correctable and happens far less often.

Unfortunately they also introduced a lot of new flaws in game play if not outright bugs and these increase in magnitude the bigger your unit size settings are. Siege is where these problems are most notable and why the game loses a lot of points and my support. Most of the rest of this game is unaffected.
 Combined, these small problems make manual control of a siege battle (On either side of the wall), overall a pretty frustrating experience. Units tend not to move how I expect them too, they are very slow to move onto and off of walls, very clanky to move about within the settlement. Any one unit moves through the city like a bus with a sleeping driver. It's honestly a bit of a nightmare and I'm deeply disappointed that this is the level of development the devs have chosen to leave it at. I held off on a review in the hopes that they would at least try to amend some of these issues. But unfortunately, my hope was in vein.

So while I recommend it over all and it IS still better than not being able to play the game at all, it's really not nearly as enjoyable as it's predecessor if you enjoy manual control over battle. Nearly every other aspect of the game is pretty smooth but siege battle is actually such a big part of the game that they really shouldn't have just left it as it is.",1702737406,1702742307,True,10,0,0.642779827117919922,0,True,False,False

Don't buy stick to the original if you can run it.

(edit) After a couple hundred hours...

Still not recomended if you can run the original without issues.

At least they ""solved"" the worse campaing breaking bug I had related to bribing enemy generals that totally bugged inside towns. The solution is crap cause now you spend the money on bribing and they auto die in the same turn, still better then bugging a entire settlement.

Some controls are better some are worse, like not beeing able to rotate the selected units without the reverting to a single line (without using groups that is) or grouped units not attacking a single target as ordered and go attack a target each.

New diplomacy is broked.

New agressive AI is even worse then the original cause it's just stupid agressive and the harder the dificulty the worse it gets. Unless you give it more cheats in form of new population mecanics.

Pathfinding and the random unit reforming bugs are worse, pathfind inside settlements was bad but now with the lack of care on the port become even worse. 
There's several settlements that have paths offset from the center of the street(usually to the left side) that leads to crapy positons, units getting stuck and units cliping inside buildings.
The unit reforming bug is very bad in camp battles it just made on of the hardest factions to fight on camp battles trivial. Scythia nightmare horse archers armys are piece of cake now as you can catch them even with heavy cav. Just charge your generals at the center and watch them start reforming as you charge.

The UI, why? Just freakin why?

The good stuff.

The squalor cap for me is a huge improvement if not the best.(Was hardcoded and couldn't be solved by modders). The amount of tedious micro of making peasant stacks to go disband/repopulate somewhere or the revolt/exterminate cycles are gone.
Hd graphics and above obviously.
The ability to run with modern setups without issues.
Much better camera.
Modding.
Night battles on vanila.
Merchants?(haven't used them yet)

-you actually have to click the walk button because movement orders are set to run by default.
-problems such as the building queue cost and senate asking you for map information of Germania even though you already obtained it aren't fixed.

The QOL features are what seals this for me, its sooooo much easier to manage large empires now with the new menus, its easy to see which cities need buildings, which are ready to upgrade, in revolt, etc. The modern controls and camera make battles as good as any newer title (as good as it can be for a game that was released in 2004) and all of this comes wrapped in the classic R:TW mechanics which are surprisingly still very relevant all these years later. Seriously there is a weight to the battles that the newer games just don't have.

The mod support is on the next level, very active with some insane projects being developed.

The improved visuals are great, both in battle and in the campaign map. Lots of bugs from the original have been fixed so game plays even better, its so much fun. 

Areas I'd like the devs to improve:
- The new UI is serviceable,  however, some quality of life items - like 1) automatically showing the building or recruitment list when clicking on a settlement and 2) combine turn announcements in one view  - would help avoid unnecessary extra clicking.
- The AI is better than the original, as they fixed many bugs. However, like the AoE2 did on their remaster, would be awesome if they would have an option to play with a reimplementation that fundamentally improves AI - for battle and campaign.

Well, I started a campaign at medium difficulty. What happens is that every faction that is not the exact same culture as me starts sending an infinite stream of armies to attack me the second I share a border with them. Doesn't matter how far away their settlements are, infinite stream of armies to attack.

Also, I had a settlement get plague. Plague ends. ONE TURN AFTER THAT, plague again. This is just unfun. It would be nice if you could capture some territory, pause, develop, and move on, especially considering that you can't just replenish damaged units you have to have the right building, and population, etc. 

And the armies they send after me are boring as hell. Beat it, a clone of it appears two turns later. Or they send five units to siege a settlement with tier 4 walls, and 20 high-tier units in it. Why? Other than to inconvenience the player, there's no real reason for it. It's annoying.

There's challenge, where the AI sends hard armies at you, or coordinates an attack, or catches you unaware.

First of all its a crash fest. Never saved so much in any game, i was afraid to press any button on the menu. Crash on random tabs, buttons, during battles, after battles, horrible. 
Game breaking was that after Marian reform, with Julii, no one in the family got married anymore, nor make any children. 
People were passing away from old age left and right and nothing. My only source of generals was to bribe rebels or other faction generals. This was the cherry on the cake on frustration and was my delete game point.

There are obviously things that could've been improved like the unit pathfinding and the campaign diplomacy especially however everything from the original has been atleast slightly improved upon (aside from the UI, though the remaster UI is ok once you get used to it). 

The battle AI cheats on Hard and Very Hard battle difficulty are also insane. The AI tier 1 units will seemingly fight to the death even against overwhelming odds, so I've turned turned the battle difficulty down to Medium but even then its tough to break alot of AI units. This change to battle AI is the biggest issue I have with the remaster.

The cool thing is, all the new changes (aside from the graphics and UI) can be reverted to the original in the settings so you can get a reskinned OG RTW experience if desired. But I prefer the remaster changes personally....aside from the changes to the battle AI on higher difficulty.

Although I still think the new UI is ugly, Feral have done many good things that address some of my original complaints. The 'toggle GUI' key is now rebindable (thank god), and armies list unit counts numerically now which nullifies the complaint I had before about the ordering of unit cards. 

If they do a Medieval 3 remaster I still really hope we get an option for the original UI, but in this state Rome Remastered still dabs over almost every modern TW. I think I'm ready to recommend this now.

Original review below.

-------

I wanted to give this a positive review, I really did. I had hoped this would sell well so we'd get a remastered Medieval II, but after playing this I'm not sure that's what I want anymore - and I cannot, in good faith, recommend this remaster.

This game controls like complete ass. And no, it's not because the original did. I've done a side-by-side, and the original is so much easier to navigate & control. Doing ANYTHING in this remaster feels like wading through mud. There is no hiding this, and there is no excusing this just because it's running on the old engine.

1. Camera movement speed on the campaign map is obscenely fast. The only way to turn this down is to adjust the ""Camera movement speed"" option; which, in turn, affects the camera speed in battles too (which is already too slow by default; lowering it any further is excruciating).
Why should I have to glue down the shift key in battles to make the camera speed tolerable? Why aren't there separate options for campaign and battle cameras? Why wasn't this a problem in the original game? One of the main selling points of the remaster was the improved camera, but I legitimately prefer the more limited camera in the original game just because it behaves consistently & as you would expect it to.

2. Why can't some controls be rebound? A number of the hotkeys for selection, as well as the ""Toggle GUI"" button are completely locked to their default bindings. Why would I want to rebind the ""hide GUI"" key, you might ask? Well, it's because...

3. The new GUI is atrocious. Utterly abominable. I can't decide whether I dislike the campaign or the battle UI more, because both are so marred with bad design choices that it's a wonder anyone approved this in the first place. It's extremely disappointing that Feral would choose to include options to restore the gameplay to be 1:1 with the original, but not any options for restoring the old UI. I am now going to break down just a few of the glaring issues with the new interface:

A.) Unit cards ordered in a single row of 20, rather than 2x 10-10 rows. This seems like a subtle and unimportant change at first, but it has a huge impact on readability. No longer can you tell at an eyeball exactly how many units are selected. The difference between 14 and 15 units is instantly recognisable in the original (1 full row and 4, stops just before the halfway point) - but in the remaster, after 6 or 7 units it gets hard to see without counting them out one by one.

B.) Similar to the above, command buttons (run, guard, skirmish, etc) in the battle UI are all now in a single row under the unit cards. Firstly this takes up unnecessary amounts of space, but secondly it makes it much harder to remember where each button is in your muscle memory. Medieval II already iterated on this 15 YEARS AGO, with its rotary telephone style button layout. Remembering that ""Fire at will"" was placed at 9 o'clock on a circle is a lot easier than remembering it's the 7th button along from the left.

C.) The UI being split all over the screen, instead of compiled in a bar down the bottom. This might be a hot take but I dislike having the UI divded all over the place in anything other than an FPS (where screen space is paramount). What's really nice about Rome and Medieval 2 is that the game makes very clear distinctions between sections of the screen - it's ""This is where the buttons are"" and ""This is where the action is"".
It's funny, because Shogun II also splits the UI all over the place but it never felt anywhere near as intrusive. Maybe some pointers could be taken from it, in terms of element sizing, positioning, opacity, etc.

D.) Wasted space. The town management screen is filled with blank boxes, overly spacious opaque backgrounds, and edges which could use some rounding out. Here's a really simple tip that should be apparent to anyone who has played a strategy game: if you aren't displaying text in a spot, DON'T HAVE A HUGE OPAQUE BOX THERE WHICH COVERS UP THE MAP. Sidenote: Everything in the town management screen is buried in 5 submenus for no reason. So many more clicks to see basic things that were instantly visible in the town overview panel in the original game (a panel, if I might add, that only takes up half the screen). What's with the inconsistency in sizing, too? I find myself having to squint to see what I'm building & recruiting in the tiny right hand menus, but the huge bar at the bottom that shows what's already built is needlessly large.

---

If anyone from Feral reads this I don't hate what you've done with the game on the whole, and I'm sorry if this come across as rude. You can tell a lot of attention and care was put into the remastered models and graphics - the game looks fantastic. Again, the fact they included options to restore classic gameplay is extremely admirable; if not for the above issues I would have utter faith in the team taking on Medieval II someday. Just don't try to vastly overhaul the UI again - the original Med 2 GUI is extremely intuitive already, and serves as a great point for beginners to the series. And please please please fix the camera speeds. Thank you.",1619709828,1699478241,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As someone that still plays the original, this is a perfect game for me, it keeps what was great in 2004/2009 and brings it back to current times in a nice package.

The graphics and models were improved, Barbarian Invasion and Alexander models especially, which weren't the best on the OG were vastly improved, though the base game ones are a little off for some, I thought they were mostly ok. The game runs fine on a GTX 1050, I3-5th gen with 8GB RAM, though the ""Sky quality"" option seens to be hogging performance, mine and most of the community's recommendation is to leave at Low, since it's not something immediatly visible and gets some extra FPS.

There's a few balancing changes, unit recruitment is still tied to population, but the cost is standard across all unit scales, balanced to normal values. Some vanilla units are also rebalanced, diplomacy was slightly improved, though it's still far from perfect, and merchants from Medieval 2 were also added. All of these changes are optional and toggable in the menu before entering a campaign.

What isn't toggable is the UI, and it's been radically changed, though I personally don't have problems with the change, and I do infact like for example the new alert system, with them not cluttering the right side of the screen, instead been inside folders for each type of alert.

The main thing is the modding support, and as someone that makes mods, this was a make or break deal, and RR is absoluteley phenomenal for it. The logging system was improved, we now can know WHY the game is crashing and all the errors that are happening, even those that don't cause crashes at first. Plenty of hardcoded limits were lifted: faction, settlement and religion limits were lifted; Map size limit has, apparently unintentionally, been lifted; BI and Alex features like immortality and hording are now possible to be ported into the base game or into mods, and scripting possibilities are further increased, and overall possibilities are much farther than we used to have, just check Imperium Surrectum for what can be done.

Overall, highly recommend the Remaster for fans of the old game, and for people who want a simpler, and in my view better, experience than newer games offer.",1698508952,1698508952,True,18,0,0.681119441986083984,0,True,False,False

Total War: Rome Remastered (I've never liked that they switched the name around) is a revamped version of the classic Rome: Total War and its two expansion packs; Barbarian Invasion and Alexander. It offers enhanced graphics, improved game play, and compatibility with modern hardware and operating systems; the Remaster not only runs on Windows like the original, but Mac OS, and Linux too.
You can also download an optional Enhanced Graphics Pack that apparently adds more details and effects to the game’s visuals, but many have said that it doesn't make much of a difference. I can't speak on that myself since I never saw the need to use it because the game already looks stunning and the graphics pack is quite large.

Many bugs have been fixed from the original game and various aspects of the game play have been modified to function better. These include an improved diplomacy system that isn't just the AI sending you alliance offers and then backstabbing you the next turn, changes to battle AI like having flaming arrows affected by rain, and even the addition of Merchants from Medieval 2: Total War which I think adds a nice spin to the game's economy. This is but a few of the many changes available, and the best part is that the player can choose whether to have the classic or remastered version of gameplay for each of the categories. This means you could keep the classic battle AI whilst having the remastered diplomacy, or turn off Merchants but keep the new Campaign changes.
I personally played with all the settings set to their Remastered version, except for Population Cost Balancing which meant that the unit size I selected in the options affected the population of the city that is consumed when recruiting units, just like in the original. This coupled with turning up the unit size to a new experimental option, meant that I really had to watch my economy when recruiting multiple units at a time. Recruiting a new unit could crash a small city's economy and destroy any chance of growth for the foreseeable future. It really made for a tense but fun campaign where every unit counted!

In addition, many of the locked factions are now playable from the beginning of the game by changing a setting in the options, including some that were previously not playable in the original version of the game without mods, like the Romano-British. 
Speaking of mods, there is also Steam workshop support for mods, making it extremely easy to try them out without a lot of messing around in File Explorer like in the original. I'd highly recommend trying out some of the highly rated mods if you get bored of the standard game.

The only criticism I have is one that many others have shared which concerns the changes made to the UI. In my opinion it is a downgrade in regards to both style and feel compared to the original, but it's a small issue and the many improvements made in the remaster make it an easy one to ignore. 

Overall I'd highly recommend this game to the fans of the original who want to come back and experience the game with a fresh coat of paint. Is it perfect? No. Is it a very good remaster? Yes. I always choose to play this version now because of the good selection of changes made.
I'd also recommend it to fans who joined Total War long after its release, because although it's a much simpler game compared to Rome 2 and subsequent games, it is its simplicity that makes it so much fun. Sometimes simpler is better.",1698472698,1698472698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Therefore my advice on how to fix things must instead be focused on the need to engage constructively with the fan base, not alienate people who have spent hundreds of dollars on their games over the years, and been the base of the company's success over the last two decades. I also suggest that DLC prices moving forward be reduced to reflect the paucity of value they provide to the game.

However... It's 30 dollars. Rome 1 was about 6 bucks when it was still on Steam. It's also got an absolutely enormous filesize and it's going to require a stronger rig to run. It's one of those games that I have to set a framerate cap on my graphics card in order to run properly. A good chunk of the appeal for Rome 1 is it can run on anything. There's even an Android version of the game so you can play it on your phone. 

Don't get me wrong. If price isn't an object, and you've got a beefy computer with plenty of disk space, this isn't a bad purchase. It's got some improvements over the original game. But at this point you might as well just buy Rome 2 unless the annoying settlement mechanics in that game are a deal breaker. 

They added merchant agents from Medieval 2, and made every faction playable without modding. The graphics look better. The UI seems like a slight downgrade to me though. To be honest, this isn't enough of an upgrade for me to just not play the original. However you can't buy the original on Steam anymore, so I'd recommend just skipping it or getting the Android version unless you are dead set on playing the first Rome on PC.

Combat in the first Rome feels much faster than in later games in the series. It's not entirely unlikely for a battle between two fully stacked armies to effectively end within a minute because several units died in a flanking charge causing a mass rout. Barbarian factions in particular tend to look very scary only for them to almost immediately rout once you take out their general or just break through their lines. The game also lacks the gameplay ruining bugs of Medieval 2 as well as the annoying settlement mechanics of later games, so if you want to play one of the classic Total War games, this is probably the best one.

However there's still big problems. The factions are all over simplified to the extent that many of their rosters aren't very historically accurate, and all the barbarian factions feel especially poorly designed. Egypt in particular uses armies more like it uses in the current newest TW title ""Pharoah"" rather than the Greek inspired armies they should use. There also just aren't many factions in earlier TW games. Rome is also split into 3 factions of Romans wearing different colored outfits in order to simulate the Roman civil wars because a proper civil war mechanic wouldn't be implemented until Rome 2. Ship combat is also entirely auto resolved. 

The biggest problem though is simply that once you get the hang of playing Total War games, none of them before maybe Napoleon or Shogun 2 offer even the slightest hint of a challenge, and this one is arguably the easiest of the lot. It's entirely possible to play as the Gauls, and immediately start conquering Rome for example. 

It's a cool game. But unless you are seriously peeved at some of the mechanics in the newer titles, I can't really see why you'd pick this up over Rome 2. If you already have the original on Steam, I also don't see much reason to upgrade to this one either.",1698292390,1698292390,False,65,0,0.722238719463348389,0,True,False,False

Many (not all) bugs and aches of old have been fixed and it looks nice and refreshed, while not losing too much of its style.
Battles look so much better in the remaster than in the original that it's not even worth discussing. They really look good. Same can't be said about the rest of the presentation. Everything else looks a bit uncanny and cheaply made. I wouldn't really mind this, it's all fine, but I'm getting to the biggest offender:

All Total War games have a very similar UI that you can intuitively navigate through if you played any other TW games. These dudes decided that they can do better and did something completely different.
I get an instant Migraine when I see this campaign UI. I can not play this. As soon as I see the UI and the slightly changed art of the map I get the instant urge to retch and puke.
Really a shame. If you never played the original RTW just buy this, you probably won't have problems with it.
If you are someone who sank a very major portion of their childhood into this game, just play the classic. The Britons/Slavs/Macedon/ Whichever previously unavailable campaign isn't worth it.

It's a great remaster and the combat and simplicity harkens back to a time when TW knew how to create satisfying gameplay instead of busy work and excel sheet simulators.

There are many improvements, not just graphics-wise. The AI itself has SOME sense now and can surprise you on the battlefield.

But few problems keep me from giving it a whole sale recommendation.

1) The AI can and will still be dumb. Even trying to set up formations can send it into a tailspin and mess up your tactics on the field. You're suppose to skirmish out of the way, not charge in...

2) Units are unresponsive at times. They will freeze before moving ahead, or just freeze up and not move at all, short of several clicks.

3) The elephant in the room, the UI, is just not player friendly compared to the old system. It feels like an excel guy designed it, rather than a gamer.

4) Generals (and some units) are WAY too powerful and unbalanced. This was most relevant in my playthrough of 
Eastern Rome against the Sassanids in BI. There is no way a swarm of well-trained spearman break against armored horsemen or levy spearman holding out against well-trained troops and breaking them. The Roman Empire was still formidable at the time and yet it felt like I was the one struggles on unit on unit encounters. Managing the fall of Rome is the challenge, not the enemy.

But despite these frustrations, it is worth your time, but stick with the short campaigns, since the long ones are time vampires.

I don't think I've ever disbanded units in order to save money, because conquest is always way more profitable. Also, Universities are important!

On the other hand, the visuals are wonderful. The new and improved textures in the campaign map as well as the units on the battle map are gorgeous, and the gameplay itself is solid.

So i can confidently say that this remaster is pathetic in its attempts with what it has set out to do.

For starters I'll note actual good improvements before i rain brimstone and fire.
The Camera, A MILLION times better, I actually can properly control it now and not have to fight it more than the Gauls during battle, navigating battles was never easier and seamless, though take this with a grain of salt as I have heard of other people facing major issues with the camera, though other than that I think its a great improvement. Other minor and notable changes such as being able to place single units into a group is very much welcomed and makes controlling one's army far more easier. Graphics are a no brainer, units have variation like in M2TW and also look very good and polished, I would even say the models are actually on par, if not better than that of Rome 2. Being able to change the balance and gameplay settings to the original and remaster is nice touch as well. For me these are the most notable changes that I found were to this game's benefit so far.

Now as for my issues, where do I even start?
First of all I would say that the excuse that ""its a remaster"" is a VERY flimsy argument to improving or fixing issues of an old game that ruin its overall quality, I think its perfectly fair to hold remasters up to modern standards in terms of gameplay and of course quality of life features. I preordered this game and was hoping/expecting for Feral to at least address issues regarding the path finding in sieges, a very big issue that prevents a player to be able to properly control their units properly in a game where reactions and timing is VERY important, I have had my own units take a stupid amount of losses from tower sentries when I command them to get onto the walls in order to.. you know.. stop the damn towers from machine gunning down my men? Is it really unreasonable to ask that the issue involving my men standing outside of a door on a tower while being gunned down down to be fix that much of an ask? There is also of course the issues of units waiting for every single individual solider to get in the exact spot in the formation which also leaves them vulnerable to attacks (especially bad for greek pike units) etc etc, I could go on and on, but I think i made my point, issues like these damper the experience and make the game annoying. (This might be a bold claim, but I swear that the path finding is actually worse in the remaster than in the original, but i digress).

Speaking of annoying, the UI. I think you all have heard about this one already seeing as how many people have complained about it, so I'll be quick with this one. In short, it sucks. Its cumbersome, clunky, awkward and confusing, I would much prefer the more efficient original UI, which displayed all the needed information, while also being easy to find what you want to either build or recruit in a few clicks, in the remaster you have to navigate a clunky mess of boxes. I would've hoped that Feral would at least included the option to switch between the new and old UI, though sadly this is not a perfect world so that isn't the case.

Another thing of note is the sounds, and issues relating to them. As soon as i loaded in my first battle, I was giddy to hear those, loud, crunchy and fantastic sounds of bowstrings twanging as they let loose arrows, swords and metal clashing violently as units both charge and clash with each other, and the loud and powerful marching of your army as it moves forward to the enemies. Well sadly I didn't really get to experience this as the sounds for me at least seem to be bugged or are very quiet compared to the original, at first I thought this was on my end though after digging around a bunch I've found out that I wasn't the only one with this issue. I have no clue if this is either due to a bug or if it was intentional though I have no way of proving this if its either as far as I'm aware, hopefully this is just a bug and not intentional, as i would rather have my loud powerful marching than having the equivalent of my soldiers walking on, what sounds like, air.

A more concerning and laughable issue is the fact that keybinding is disabled right off the bat, Yep! you heard right, you can't keybind as soon as you launch the game, you apparently have to go though the game's tutorial in order to be granted such a luxury now (in the original you could keybind right away). I have played alot of remasters, and during all that time spent playing them I have not ONCE came across one that restricted the access of binding keys, something like this now a days should be in the game without question, its one of those simple but essential things, Its comparable to being forced to go though all the tedious steps of running the original doom etc. I know I'm likely over blowing this one but its VERY concerning when such a simple feature isn't fully present with a remaster at launch. (I'm aware there is a mod that fixes this, though to be frank, its the dev's job to fix such issues and is honestly quite sad to see modders having to pick up after the Dev's issues and mistakes).

And Lastly the AI, its been quite a long while since I've played Rome 1 due to technical issues and it not playing nice with a modern system, but in short, I guess its better? I think I would need more time for this one but as far as I'm aware the AI seems to be a tad bit smarter and isn't AS dumb though it still does have moments where it derps out. thought I'd just quickly mention this.

I won't be covering absolutely every tiny detail, change or issue else I'd be here all day, though I think what I have mentioned is serviceable to this review of mine.

As for my verdict, I left this game/remaster feeling a great sense of.. ""eh"" and ""meh"". The changes and ""fixes"" the remaster offers, while nice begins drop off very quickly when I realise that alot of issues from the original are still present. I think a good way of saying it is that it leaves much to be desired, along with a great sense of disappointment. They could've done far better and so much more with this remaster, and made an already legendary game into something even greater. Of course thats not to discredit the dev's work put into this, as I can most certainly see some shimmers of passion here and there, though sadly that isn't enough to fix a remaster that is both immensely disappointing and lacklustre. Hopefully these issues (as unlikely as it is) will be addressed and fixed with future patches. Its by no means Warcraft 3 remaster levels of bad, far from it, but it could've been so much more.

Overall, I'd say not to purchase this game and stick with the original for the time being, there are some fixes to their issues from what I heard and rolling back one of the patches does apparently fix alot of issues with it. Hopefully my review provided some insight and was helpful.

Update:

After not touching this game for a LONG time I am pleased to report that MOST of the issues have been resolved in some way shape or form, such as the poor or odd sound being fixed to sound more impactful and loud much like the original game. Of course the issues with the UI seem to be less ""worse"" but I would still much prefer the original with some of the qol menus etc. However I still can't recommend buying this game or giving any money to CA, as while it does play alot better now compared to the original there has been no effort at all to address the immensely poor performance of the classic edition (honestly with how it looks I wouldn't be surprised if the performance of the classic Rome was made worse on purpose).

In short, if you REALLY want this game, PLEASE get it from a 3rd party seller. With how CA is today they don't deserve anyone's hard earned money.",1620061335,1695914872,False,94,3,0.694237709045410156,0,True,False,False

Rome: Total War Remastered takes the parts of Rome 2 that worked and introduces them to Rome 1. Simultaneously reverting the changes made in 2 that didn't work. It's the best of both worlds. Rome 1 is one of the best strategy games of all time, and Rome 2 is pretty good too, so this combination of the better parts of each works wonderfully. It has the smaller scale, quicker battles, cheesy speeches and more arcadey feel of Rome 1, which is all great. I don't need 125 factions that all feel the same or a giant map where I'm railroaded to make the same choices each time. I don't want to choose whether a city has room for a sewer or a barracks. Or not build a port because another town on the other side of the country already has one and building a second one in the same region ""wouldn't be optimal"".

The new UI feels slick and polished and actually shows more information at a glance than the old one did. It's not dumbed down, it's just cleaned up. I have a ton of nostalgia for the original game, but I don't miss UIs designed for 1024x768 monitors. The whole game just moves faster and feels a lot smoother than either Rome 1 or Rome 2 did. And because it flows so much quicker, there's no temptation to auto-resolve battles which always felt like missing the point of playing a Total War game.

I looked at the negative Steam reviews before making my purchase as one usually does, and I'm glad I didn't listen. One of the highest rated reviews is a guy complaining that the game has great mods. How is that a complaint? Plenty of talk of crashes yet I haven't encountered a single one. Then again there are always complaints about crashes in the Steam reviews for any game, so I suppose people just have crappy PCs. The rest are either complaining that it isn't exactly like Rome 1 (Rome 1 still exists - it even comes free with the remaster), or that it doesn't have the shining AAA graphics of 2023 (which bloat development costs and are the reason so many modern games are such bland safe trash), or that the optional 4K texture pack takes up 20 gigs (as if I care about 20 gigs).

I played most of these back when they were first released, and long looked forward to the next to emerge. To be a fan of the TW series is to accept that Creative Assembly and Sega hold their customers to be their Beta testers. At some point you have to just take a break and not buy their garbage for a while. Every TW game is a bug-ridden CTD mess for months and even years after release - but the concept and the potential of the game remains and, like a one good golf shot will get you back on the course, one good day of playing the game without a crash is a day to remember. It has always been the gamers that fix the TW game and realize its potential. Rome TW and it's successors are unstable, unhistorical, breathtakingly underdeveloped games - Rome Total Realism - a mod that took 5 years - is a masterpiece. Total War Empire is an unplayable ahistorical disaster in release, salvaged to playabilty only years later. TWEmpire DE is the culmination not of the efforts ANY dilligence of CA or Sega, but rather all the fixes realized by the community of fans. TW Napoleon is yet additional improvements brought about by players and fans. And the Napoleon DarthMod is the masterwork that TWEmpire could have been from the beginning. But CA is fine with this. Sega is fine with this. They have been rewarded over and over again for counting on their players to fix their garbage and to simply patch, patch, patch, patch, patch. 

Rome Remastered is NOT the culmination of all of this process, as it could have been. It is in fact, taking Rome back to its CA/Sega unplayable idiocy, just for higher GPUs. All the excellence and nuance and smooth playability of the 10 years of player modding and correcting was jettisoned in favor of a Grand New Vanilla,  and we the customers are back where CA and Sega want us - beta testers for their latest unfinished, unstable product. CA and Sega support is an email-only joke.  1) They don't know how to fix the game and 2) don't care at all that they don't. It is released to the market, they are paid, and they know that their customers will find the actual potential of the game and fix it over the next couple years.  

Bottom line: Avoid all Creative Assembly Sega Total War releases until at least 2-3 years have passed. They are always a disaster, and they don't care. It's their business model.

UPDATE 8/18/2022: 

GAME STILL A CTD MESS OF CRAP. 

SEGA, CA AND THE TW GANG STILL COULD NOT CARE LESS.

So now running on Origin PC w/ i7, 2.3 Ghz, 32GB, Nvidia 3070 RTX Ti and game is pretty stable. Have received a great deal of good help from Gamer Sensei, Corsair, and Origin. 

CA and SEGA support still utterly useless, unreachable, and uninterested. 

Full massive battles on ultra now running smoothly and game is fun again.

The battles are so much better than later iterations of Total War with a proper morale mechanic that rewards tactical gameplay as well as proper formations and damage that makes it feel much more like a tactical battle than the arcadey feel of the later games. On the campaign map too I'm really enjoying the depth of the strategic gameplay with a traits and ancillaries system which again hugely outdoes the later versions, senate missions, detachable units, freedom to build and upgrade all cities as well as towers and forts. Plus a diplomacy system that actually makes sense, with factions accepting ceasefires when they're losing a war. The graphical enhancements as well with unit variation adds just a little bit more realism for extra immersion although Egypt is still hugely anachronistic. All in all it feels like a proper Total War game and I'm starting to remember how I felt when the original Rome came out when I was young! I would definitely recommend this game.

If you enjoyed Rome 1, it is still in many ways a waste of your money. Rome 1 is absolutely superior in terms of mods, UI and city management interface, and even battles. 

Rome Remastered is far too fluffed up and none of the actual problems from the original was ever fixed or expanded upon. Its an extremely lazy cash grab and it has its ""Mostly Positive"" reviews simply due to CA bots and my evidence for this is simply read the majority of positive reviews. Hardly any of them are informative and most of them sugercoat this remaster all in an attempt to convince you to waste your $$$.

If I had to describe it in as few words as I can, ""Lazy Remaster aimed at Getting $$$ from Nostalgic Nerds"" 
One thing it does better is simply modding ability. In the OG Rome and Medieval 2 there was a limit on the number of settlements and factions. Rome Remastered does away with it, so some mods are able to be far more deep. But the modding scene for Remastered is dead, since many bugs are present and AI pathfinding is still awful.

TL;DR: Modern, polished and faithful to the original; gives you control over your experience.

Pros:
-----
- Graphics have been heavily upgraded, yet stay faithful to the original game.
- Game play is almost identical to the original game; most of the changes are appreciated quality of life upgrades.
- Any upgraded mechanics from newer Total War games can be toggled on or off. You can play with the original mechanics and balance, Feral's remastered mechanics and balance, or turn individual fixes they added on or off.
- Upgraded mechanics and balance fix many of the original game's issues.
- No need for mods to play all factions in the campaign.
- Very well optimised, runs on a potato.
- Remaster includes Barbarian Invasion and Alexander expansions, both also remastered.
- Supports modern features such as Ultrawide 21:9, and modern WASD camera control.
- Fair price given the quality and in-depth nature of the remaster, and the included expansions.

Cons:
------
- Some stuttering and FPS drop here and there when zooming out on a late game campaign map.
- Some new menus and information boxes can be annoying and cannot be disabled in the battle screen.
- New city UI for the campaign map may take some getting used to; although it is not worse than the original, it is quite a jarring difference for returning players.
- Path finding, although much improved, can still struggle at times.
- Using right click + mouse (not right click only, but the move order that highlights where the unit will be) to give large units a move order is still difficult in cities, with many placements rejected until it's ""just right"".
- (Not relevant to this game); Uncertain future of Total War remasters: this game was made as a passion project at Feral's request to SEGA, not the other way around. SEGA does not seem interesting in remastering Medieval 2 or others, which run on the same engine. No info as of August 2023.",1693476866,1693479405,True,20,1,0.675648391246795654,0,True,False,False

I thought I'd grown out of Total War games after more than two decades playing them (since the 1st Shogun announced as Taishou).  This game takes me back to the joy of playing RTW the first time.  It really is the apex of the franchise.  
I was wary of making the purchase as I remembered the annoying problems of the original which made me fall out of love with it.  Critics seemed to be saying it's RTW as we remembered warts and all!  I disagree.
I recalled the old problems, AI armies laying siege to lightly defended towns and suddenly moving away.  Diplomats making ridiculous random offers, passive enemy armies on the campaign map and static enemy units on the battlefield making no effort to evade missile attacks etc.
While not perfect this re-master seems to have largely solved these issues providing a fascinating challenge at the higher difficulties.
The QOL and graphic improvements, the new features, are fantastic.  The camera zoom and pan... perfect.  You can even make the tree cover invisible so you can see into those pesky forests.
It's literally one of the best games I've ever played, and definitely the best total war game.  The clean, and clear graphics are much better than the overly busy, confusing mess of later total war games (after Shogun 2).  
With the expansions included, and the mod support, the team responsible for this re-master deserve the highest praise. Superb!",1690548585,1693470253,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

You can see from my playtime that clearly I enjoy the game. I want to be clear though, this game is EXACTLY the same as the original Rome: Total War. Massive improvements have been made to the graphics in battle and campaign map, some reviews seem to think the graphics have been downgraded from the original which imo is completely ridiculous. For me, the best QoL change has been to the camera and unit controls which are much less clunky than the original. Aside from those things the game is exactly the same as you remember minus bugs and crashes which may occur. The game is also very thorough with autosaves allowing you to backtrack and try again if something ludicrous happens like your general dying on the first charge. 

The Barbarian Invasion (BI) and Alexander campaigns have also been remastered to the same standard and although I don't particularly care for Alexander, the BI campaign (Essentially the prototype to Attila: Total War) is in my opinion as good as the original game with a very different starting landscape in terms of factions.

My final (And perhaps main) point is with regards to mods. With the modern iteration of the game, Steam workshop support has been heavily improved and there are literally hundreds of mods to explore. Simple ones such as those which increase the density of settlements on the map/starting positions (One of my favourites https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2517205898), unit overhauls which change the unit roster of historically inaccurate factions (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2799858239), map mods which increase the playable map to Persia or even beyond to India (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2997498252) through to total conversion mods where the entire faction and unit roster has been overhauled (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2487698001). In addition, similar mods are also available for BI and Alexander! (BI extended map + extra settlements https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2954132285) (BI extended map + extra factions https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2866202220) (Alexander overhaul https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2784981080)

All of these mods can be downloaded and installed with extreme ease via the game's dedicated launcher and toggled on or off with the press of a single button which is simply brilliant and has extended my interest in the game for many hours.",1693134907,1693143103,True,60,0,0.84808117151260376,0,True,False,False

885970,143912908,76561198203902975,0,10,1520,0,250,1693979800,"The path-finding and user interface issues persist even after the final patch. Customization has somehow decreased relative to the original, in terms of key binding and ability to modify the user interface from the game files. The lack of ability to switch back to the original user interface formatting (which allowed for quicker game-play decisions and higher micromanagement capability) is questionable. I wonder if anyone at Feral (or the current dev team at Creative Assembly) was even active on the Rome 1 multiplayer scene at any point. People edited game files and had mods for simplified user interface options and quick-reaction key bindings specifically for competitive multiplayer. That could never happen with the parameters of this remaster, unfortunately.

The campaign list scroll seems to lack numbers for the info of settlements, and the ability to have to 2 scrolls open at once to have quicker micromanagement is somehow gone? Having the list scroll open on one side of the screen while opening the management pages for each individual settlement from the ascending / descending order based on public order VALUE / percentage (not just a red or green face) is no longer an option with this unnecessarily handicapped user interface in remastered. It feels like the type of questionable design downgrade made for Rome 2 at launch (watch Angry Joe's review of Rome 2 for reference).

Having one scroll open for hard values on the settlement list, and another open that can switch between the settlements that you right click on the list based on their status, was a basic feature of the original. How are we losing features to this day? 

YouTube channels like Dolfy, Biscuits Total War, Prince of Macedon, Melkor, Guidea TW, Volound, Martin Commander, To Nerd is to Human TNH, HappyCompyTW, Angry Joe, and more would have been able to give insight on improvements during development.

The theme of the old main menu and loading screens, with silhouettes against a cloudy red background, was one of the greatest design decisions of all time, and it has also been taken away for some reason. There should at least be a way to toggle back to the menu and loading screen theme of the original, which Blizzard managed to implement in StarCraft Remastered.

What's worst is that multiplayer and co-op campaign received almost no support, despite multiplayer being the main priority from the Rome 1 community before release. Rome 1 multiplayer has been effectively locked behind a paywall by Remastered, for newer players that want to enter the community. There is no more $5 Steam sale option. The multiplayer scene has been effectively handicapped since there is no cross-play between the remaster and original (Blizzard also accomplished this with StarCraft Remastered), and the original has been removed from the market for some reason.

The multiplayer chat lobby and player list of those online (in general) is completely gone now. There are no more chat channels to see who is online to set up matches with the community while in-game. Once I am hosting a multiplayer match, I can't chat with the community in the main multiplayer chat room any more. There is effectively no way to communicate or invite players to games any more. The multiplayer scene is less alive than the original somehow, as a result of this. Crashing is now more common during multiplayer army selection while in a lobby. Clearly multiplayer was an afterthought for the game that brought the series into the spotlight for multiplayer battles with Prince of Macedon's online Rome Total War free for all battles.

They still have the opportunity to patch the game and add in more multiplayer or co-op campaign support, but I cannot give the game a positive review until then. If Creative Assembly could patch Rome 2 nearly a decade after release, surely they can work on supporting the Rome 1 multiplayer community instead of undermining it.

The custom battle map editor has also been removed for some reason. The map editor was a core part of the original, and always made online multiplayer interesting with new maps from different hosts. The level of complexity and customization has decreased, with no justification. Countless members of the online multiplayer, tournament clan, and dedicated Rome 1 community would have been more inclined to purchase this title if that was included.

It was also unsettling to see the release of this remaster coincide with mass copyright strikes on Rome 1 and Medieval 2 Total War official soundtrack content online. There were many creative and well-designed videos on YouTube that implemented the soundtrack of these games, but the release of this game somehow caused most to be taken down. There is no reason to get rid of that which promotes your game and people love, unless you want to fan the fire of players like with Three Kingdoms once again.

Even still, this is a good game and a decent remaster. It would just be ideal if Creative Assembly and Feral put more work into their games and patch updates before abandonment (Three Kingdoms).

-General understanding of the strengths of the original
-keeping the core of the game
-updating and improving lackluster sections, and making those improvements optional
-any additions feel somewhat natural, and are also optional
I do have issues with the general graphical style, but that's just personal preference. Some UI decisions feel weird and information can feel really small and unintuitive to find. It takes getting used to coming from the original. 
When I recommend to new players to play rome, it will be this version. For those who already have the original, this is a decision to mull over whether what it adds is worth it (at least it comes with the original and its all expansions if you despise every change made) 

Its ROME:TOTAL WAR like Iv'e played for 15 years, but a little more. It's nothing that blows me away but there was some genuine effort and I'm glad it exists.

Brings great fun to this day, but the remaster made some things wrong. It's a good remaster, but not a perfect one. Could use another update to polish the game and make it a perfect TW-modding platform.. There are some issues that should have been ironed out with one more update, but Feral was a 3rd developer hired by CA to to this remaster and they won't update this game any more.

It offers unlimited modding possibilities, but still can be glitchy at times. Pathfinding has been noticeably improved, but of course it's still not perfect, especially around bridge ends. Game is very heavy and too bad there is no ""light"" install version that wouldn't clog up too much of your SSD, for example to use for mods.

When it comes to UI, it actually isn't bad. It's completely different from R1/M2 so muscle memory from those games is useless here, but I got used to it after 10-15 hours of gameplay. It's pretty reasonable and everything is doable with the new UI, but it has one huge problem: scale. And the text scale. Buttons and text are way too small. They tried to make everything look roman-style, but that meant they traded visibility for visuals. But other than that it's fine in my opinion. ""Tactical map"" from R2 comes here, but it's actually useable. Unit cards were completely changed rather than upscaled (there is a mod for it), also unit orders in battle are still ""laggy"" as in the original. Difficulty combat modifiers are still very punishing. And a lot of other things, good and bad, that I can't fit in the review word limit. 

If you have too much time and want to read everything (good and bad) that I noticed in this game when playing it, you can have a look: https://pastebin.com/54Q2XqJH

And get this, they say they've fixed bugs and made things smoother. You know how those old games had some quirks? Well, they're trying to sort that out to make the experience better. That's a big thumbs up from me.

Now, I'm hoping they kept the heart of the game, you know? The strategy, the conquests, and all that historical goodness. From what I've heard, they didn't mess with that stuff, and that's a relief.

Oh, and don't forget about the AI. The AI in the original had its moments of being... well, not the brightest bulb.

It has its flaws... Enemy generals on the field of battle are your best friends, and your AI controlled generals are your worst enemies, and they are both there to throw their lives sooner or later in some suicidal charge. But long therm campaign strategy is crippled by terrible diplomacy and AI. I really can't understand, how is it so difficult to fix diplomacy in Total War games, and why is this aspect of war, called politics and diplomacy so neglected and shallow.  
Every faction every time act in a way that forces your hand to destroy it! It would have been perfectly fine if there was just a lack of the initiative from a weaker faction to get a peace agreement with you, or get on your good side if you were much stronger, but they act like they make decisions by flipping a coin as many times as it takes until it falls on a ""war"" side. They are in war with same factions as you are, you share obviously same interests, they are invaded by common enemy, and you are helping them for years! You have never been in war with them or broke any deal, they signed alliance with you and granted military access, but not only that they will never assist you except when you fight literally next to their army, they will take every stupidest chance to stab you in the back! And then things get even worse! Defeated and with their capital surrounded by 5 x stronger forces, and knowing that you have twice as many forces nearby, they will throw away every offer for peace! Not to be a protectorate, not to be forced in alliance or to pay tribute or reparations, they are even offered 100% of their former territory back, just to stop attacking you without any chance to win anything! No! They are all ""Spartans"", but on the top of that fanatical heroism, they even lost their minds and prefer war! They are just acting stupid. Not that history, and even present days aren't full of examples that on the surface looks like that, but there is always some minimum of reason behind even worse decisions. AI factions in Rome Total War act all like some suicide cults! What use you have of alliances and diplomacy? They build army, and attack everyone for no reason, no matter if they are prepared or not. Their spies and diplomats are just decoration, they only telegraph to you that their faction is going to attack you, and have no important purpose no matter what difficulty you play.

I can recommend this. Only played for a few hours so far. 

Pro

It's a good remaster and am looking forward to getting some overhaul mods such as Chivalry installed.
Like how they have improved the faction limit for mods. 
Speaking off which this remaster is built on top of Medieval 2  as we now have Merchants.... which means a medieval Remaster can't be far off.  


Cons

The new interface takes some getting use to if you've played the original game. By that I don't mean it's not impossible to get use to it just it will take some time.

I pre-ordered this game because I was a fan of the original Rome Total War. And I turned out to be happy!

This game was the first for many who wished to get acquainted with this series of games. It also provided the very emotions for most that brought us closer together. Now Creative Assembly do not make such games, they worsen the combat in favor of a large-scale spectacle. If you remember Shogun or Empire, it was the pinnacle of Creative Assembly, when the graphics were at a high level at the time, there was full support for the Russian language and every warrior would be unique in its tragedy of death, or an animal rush of victory.

And most importantly, in those bearded days the company was not playing with popular opinion at the expense of politics, and tried to surprise the player some-no, but a solemn story (Recall the ending of Shogun 2 after the victory of one side) or an excellent tactics mechanics, where you can control your army, using the landscape and breeches in enemy defenses, and watch the beautiful duels of some of the soldiers that stab each other and lie in agony, knowing that they can not escape.

Don't play politics, or politics will crush you with a heavy load of muck, betrayal and hatred.

Одно из лучших переизданий за последние 5 лет. Улучшило графику, управление и привнесло много нового!

Я предзаказал эту игру, ибо был поклонником оригинального Рим Тотал вар. И оказался счастлив!

Эта игра была первой для многих, кто пожелал познакомиться с этой серией игр. Она же и подарила те самые эмоции для большинства, которые сблизили нас. Сейчас уже Creative Assembly такие игры не делают, ухудшают саму боевку в пользу масштабной зрелищности. Если вспомнить тот же Shogun или Empire, то там была вершина мастерства Creative Assembly, когда графика была на высоком уровне в то время, была полная поддержка русского языка и каждый воин бы уникален в своей трагедии гибели, или животном порыве победы.

И главное, в те бородатые времена компания не игралась с народным мнением за счет политики, а пыталась удивить игрока какой-никакой, но торжественной историей (Вспомним концовку Shogun 2 после победы одной из сторон) или отличной механикой тактики, где можно управлять своей армией, пользуясь ландшафтом и брежами в обороне врага, так и наблюдать за прекрасными дуэлями некоторых из солдат, что пронзают друг друга и лежат в агонии, понимая, что спастись им уже не получится.

Не играйте в политику, иначе политика задавит вас тяжким грузом навоза, предательств и ненависти.",1686509598,1687063613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ever played a game from your childhood and discovered it looks far worse than you remember? This game looks and plays the way you remember RTW did. I kinda have to wonder if the people comparing this unfavourably to the original have actually played the original recently. 

IMO this is what a remaster should be, it's a big visual upgrade that holds the essence of the original game while improving the things that needed improving.

The big change is the UI. It's jarring and unfamiliar at first for hardcore fans of RTW and M2TW, but once you are familiar with it IMO it's a major improvement. Especially in the mid-late game when you're managing many settlements and armies. 

Campaign AI is notably better (though still not exactly great) and it's possible to negotiate lasting peace or alliances. Though the Romans are still berserk and will target the player over other options. The AI seems to avoid going to war with multiple factions now acting in it's own interest more, instead of targeting everyone in a free-for-all or only targeting the player. 

There's been some noticeable rebalancing of the barbarian factions so that they aren't complete walkovers though. The AI Romans haven't steamrolled the map in my playthrough. 

Battles are smoother, especially sieges, and look great. I do wish they'd changed the city maps from every city being a square though. 

There are even larger unit scales now, so I've had some mega-battles that feel closer to the real thing in scale, instead of scaled-down representations of real battles. (~4,000 men per side, not including reinforcements).

All improvements. But there will definitely be moments when that AI does goofy stuff.

Update: The mod scene for this game is great. The RS2 and RTR teams collaborated to form what is probably the most expansive mod for ANY Total War game. Old mods for the original RTW like Chivalry have been ported to this game as well.",1684555997,1686828990,True,15,0,0.684084117412567139,0,True,False,False

There's no setting to revert to the old UI, there are no mods to date that can bring it back and they've also somehow managed to turn this into Total War comedy with their new ""icons"" on top of your units, projectile trails (those these can admittedly be turned off) and a plethora of other issues.

No.  We don't want the game to be too realistic, now do we?

Did they solve the issue where siege towers refuse to unload their units?  Can't say yet, but probably not!

I also had two major bugs in the tutorial- one where it refused to progress me to the next tip, which meant I couldn't continue the campaign, because features in it are unlocked gradually.  God forbid a player actually say midway through ""nope, I'm good, I don't need help anymore!""  And the second bug was my ship insisting ""it couldn't sail there"" through a green area of water.  I'm not asking it to sail to the New World or on land!  Just go the nearby island!  So they clearly haven't fixed naval navigation completely, either, though it's better than the base game.

My biggest two dealbreakers are the new UI and the removal of all the flavour-text from the unit cards, the buildings, the agent/character traits, and so on. It just lost so much flavour with their removals it's hard to see it as a remaster and not just a stripped-down version that somehow manages to be 20x times the file-size. It doesn't exactly help the Remaster's case that they've locked unit sizes to the graphics settings. Now, you can pretty easily work around this by selecting the highest settings, starting a campaign, then lowering them to what your setup will run more smoothly, but it's a hassle. I also don't like the location of or the tiny size of the minimap; it's too small to be of any use in the kinds of battles where you need it. 

If these other issues didn't exist I'd cope with the pathfinding, but frankly it's atrocious. The weird haircuts on a bunch of the soldiers don't help either, but my biggest issues are the weird new UI + the lack of text for traits and such giving examples and describing what they mean in more detail. And I don't know who thought it was a good idea to have soldiers auto-run in a game where fatigue affects morale and battle performance, but let me tell you it was a stupid idea.

As-is, I honestly regret spending money on this, and I've unironically kept playing the original periodically ever since I got it on disk, way back when - easily more than ten years ago.


EDIT tried it again in 2023 and the autorun, the weird campaign UI and the ugly lines you can't get rid of in the battles all conspire to make it unplayeable if you're after a game like the original.

This was my first RTS that really got me hooked into the genre and I loved this game because it was fun (still is), not because of nostalgia. Its arguably one of the best Total Wars alongside Medieval II. Now that I talked about the vanilla version, lets look at why the remastered sucks. Two BIG reasons... 
1) The AI is passive! So passive that they will stack armies upon armies and WILL not attack you. If you happened to start construction on a building, they may(may) play more aggressively. Imagine playing the Seleucid Empire and finding Egypt being so passive that you can easily wipe out Parthia without them attacking you once. Armenia and Pontus are so aggressive with their one spy and that is it. This is the Seleucid Empire on HARD mode. In vanilla, you would be begging for one of these factions to leave you alone for one turn. If the AI decides to attack you, they will do the most shameful option, starve your city without giving you the chance to defend it behind your walls. They almost always will do this, so unless you have stone walls, don't bother building walls. ITS BEEN ALMOST TWO YEARS FERAL!
2) The UI is undesirable. Granted, I play LOTR TW's mod and its an improvement, not so much for vanilla. Smaller windows, no more fun time closing your notifications on your left screen. You have to click more buttons to do things. Moving armies over to other armies or cities is a nightmare because the window does not close once you have done the task. It STAYS there and you have to awkwardly close the window for the action to happen. The unit cards look worse IMO.

As the player you feel like you are actually taking  country's over now as there is more settlements on the map making wars more drawn out and i think more enjoyable to play. you defiantly need to consider your choices more carefully as any mistake will lead to marge set backs when campaigning like you need to build a recruitment base as well as all you military buildings to start recruiting or healing troops and these building take 6 turns to complete.

Graphics, AI, diplomacy and battle mechanics and almost everything is made at highest level and made the game more realistic and brought to the game more ways to develop strategy.  Game developers have done their best to not affect key aspects of the game and just improved only necessary parts.
At the same time almost every improvement is reversible, and gamers can select the classic or remastered version. For me i have reversed how battle camera works. This aspect adds and additional point to this remaster.
Give yourself a little time to get used to and enjoy this game completely as it deserves.

Wish someone could give the Old UI back. This UI is too much like the Rome 2.

Another thing is, I played much less Total war series after Napoleon total war, I guess it is about the UI . Those round buttons are annoy. Or maybe the unit size, I feel those soldiers are so small so distant. 


Probably The devs want more new players to play this game. But I don't think so. The Graphic is still old. The loading is slow with those textures. And TBH, as long as it supports Ultra wide and high resolution, I am fine with anything else on UI aspect in the old version of RTW.

You get used to the new UI, which is harder to navigate, but on the other hand does have some advantages: for example, the list of settlements tab makes it a lot easier to see which towns can build and recruit each turn. 
You get occasional crashes but in my experience, they generally occur only when you get above 50 settlements. Frequent saving can mitigate lost progress.

Unfortunately the latest patch disabled a couple of the achievements, and this may never be solved, seeing as how these big companies seem to abandon their games soon after launch. Maybe this means that an inaccessible Timber resource in Cyrenaica will never be fixed either...

Anyway, under the hood it's still the same old [i]Rome: Total War[/i], and the same addictive gameplay loop, dated but still fun. Because of this, and although I think everyone can agree this remaster could've been done better, it scrapes a pass.

I discovered RTW in early 2005 and was an avid fan of the game ever since. 
At first I was reluctant of going over to the remastered edition, but ever since I did I have no regrets. 
Some say the UI is terrible but in my opinion it’s jut a matter of getting used to something new. 
One of the best thing for me is that modders are no longer held back by hard coded limits of factions, cultures and religions. That opens up so many possibilities that we didn’t have with the classic edition.
To be fair the modding community isn’t what it used to be 10 or 15 years ago, but this is not surprising considering that we have far newer and more popular TW games. There’s still a fair amount of mods to be discovered and enjoyed.

It's just Rome TW again, but in a nicer coat.

The pathfinding hasn't changed, it still sucks.
It's always good to see men falling off the walls, something I miss in newer TW games.

The mod changes the map and factions in a huge way.

It's 1000 times worse than the original and the text is so small it can barely be read. The issues are hard-coded and Feral won't fix it or update this game anymore. When I tell you that it's bad I really mean it.

It stinks to high heaven and if you're used to the original UI or typical ones in TW games you will absolutely hate it. 

The UI mods that do exist simply can't mitigate how awful it is and clash with many overhauls. Something as rudimentary as clicking on an army and moving it out of a city (Which used to take one click just like in any TW game) now require sub menus. Unit queues, buildings and descriptions are so tiny they are almost indecipherable which destroys all the charm and immersion from the original. City management is buried in multiple sub menus and icons are so small you almost need a magnifying glass to tell what's going on. 

It was a massive mistake by the devs to basically keep and port the mobile UI to PC (Which I know they did because I own RTW on Android) instead of keeping the original or designing a PC friendly UI from scratch. I don't know if it was just laziness or cost concerns but it's incredibly disappointing and shame on CA for allowing it. Making a 20 year old UI exponentially worse is quite a feat (And then selling it for $30 for memberberries to people who mostly already bought it on disc years ago). WOW HD TEXTURES! What a joke. 

And CA will likely take all the wrong lessons from this remaster failing commercially. And that is that remasters aren't worth doing or investing in rather than PC users not liking it because it's a half baked, mobile port and cash grab that they abandoned the second they could. 

You just hope they don't do the same thing to Medieval 2.

- Remastered Graphics are cartoonish (in campaign as well as in battle). They look like made of modelling clay, childish and funny, and that doesn't provide a good immersion.
- Death animations are the same as original. And only a couple combat animations were introduced. This game needed a heavy effort in this direction.
- No blood. A mod shows that blood could have been introduced, and they didn't.
- Original RTW can use the mouse as well as the keyboard to move the battle camera. The camera in this game remastered works well with the mouse, but it's horrible with the keyboard, almost impossible to use.
- The UI in battles still doesn't fully work.
- The campaign UI takes too much space, it's disorganized and dull. And it's not characterized per faction. In original RTW you have a different artistic UI per faction.
- In the UI now we have to click too many times for things that can be displayed with one simple click (for example: to see buildings in settlements, to check campaign messages, etc).
-  Income effects in settlements are displayed in separated window, so you need an extra click. Before you could see everything in one single screen.
- To check other factions standing with yours, you have to click faction by faction. It would have been better with mouse over, like original RTW, or M2TW. My wrist is in pain everytime i have to check faction standing.

There are more downsides, but those are the main ones and i don't feel like writing everything here. There are also some improvements. 

The only two significant improvements are:
- VERY IMPORTANT: They lifted modding limits!! This is the best feature.
- Reputation now is displayed.

Other improvements that are not important:
- Total effects for ancillaries and traits are displayed.
- Easy way to transfer ancillaries.
- Soldiers get dirty depending on weather conditions. Nice touch.


Adding a tone of new battle and death animations, while keeping same original graphics (but with better high definition textures), is in my opinion what could have made this remastered version shine, and they did cartoonish graphics and same animations. Those are the most disappointing downsides.

In total there are more downsides than improvements. And that's disappointing: they should have done very important improvements that give us a good reason to play this remastered version, instead of... the same game with cartoonish graphics, worse UI and only two significant improvements (one of them depends on modders who it's possible never do a great mod worth to play).

The game feels clunky the UI is awful and the new textures are well meh , only get this game if you cant sort out the performance issues in the old game if you have discs then don't bother with this game its in my view just a worse experience which is a shame because Rome is a classic.

Total War saga games. I have about 7 of them and surprisingly a close runner up is the Medieval Definitive Edition release, no doubt because of its many similarities to Rome Remastered, save graphical re-work and UI changes.  I don't mind tedious UI either as long as it is intelligently elaborate and descriptive where it should be and I feel this game does that. 
     For settlement management, I just scrolled through my kingdoms 1 by 1 each turn and checked the construction tree for each which is very simple once you memorize what the symbols mean(simply hover over the symbol for a second if you aren't sure.. like the ship wheel icon is your naval building, wine glass is tavern, sword is barracks, bow is.. well you get the point). The tree helps you know what is all either completed, available to construct, or currently in construction which in my opinion makes my life a lot easier when i have 14 kingdoms to manage or so lol.  And when things get too tedious, I just throw a couple zones into auto-manage mode and pretend they are proxy kingdoms I've conquered or something (whatever helps you sleep at night). 
     Also, I like the old agent system which is something this game does superbly.   There's nothing more satisfying than a boss diplomat bribing armies to join you, or a crafty merchant who is buying out enemy merchs left and right.  
     I would have liked the informational tab for each sprite/class to have been a little more unique per class, however.  Many of them are just re-hashes of others, often copy and pasted info if they fall under a common sub-class like barbarian warbands for example. To be fair barb warbs basically made up half of the opposition against Rome during the era, but I found myself lacking intrigue in many classes after seeing the copy and pasted descriptions.  I also felt like I would even read the same description for classes of different factions which I can understand if they are mercenaries or something but anyways you get what i'm saying, I'm kind of a history nerd :D.
     The battles are epic with smooth mechanics and pleasing graphics.  I love the Gauls and their Celtic personality the most I think.  They blow an awesome horn and have druids that chant crazy songs in battle lol, they're just great. Custom battles are pretty fun too just to mess around or test out strategies. Don't forget that for the imperial campaign, you can have all factions unlocked in the advanced options from the app launcher after you have launched it from Total War's launcher...( i know kinda dumb lol) anyways, hope you will consider what i've said up against some of the negative comments about this game.

UI is a bit annoying, but most of the changes are optional and I love that. Combine that with half price for owners of the original, and this seems like a damn good remaster.  It's Rome Total War, but it runs on modern hardware and looks beautiful. I may update this review once I have played more.

Edit: Initially reviewed the game when it came out and I hoped the UI would improve. It has not. Almost all actions take 1-2 more clicks than they would in the original. Information is nowhere near as available as it should be and the UI is very difficult to mod, so this problem cannot be easily remedied.

It's a major creative choice flaw to give it the Rome 2 UI, camera work, and ""feel"" to the game instead of retaining its core OG roots. It's trying to change a game you're remastering- that's not the point of remastering. You update it, give it some polish, maybe some new mechanics or features to the game that don't kill it but still retain its original premise - but you don't overhaul the UI to your annoying one, add elements from another game packaged with the aforementioned UI into it that don't necessarily work and just move to complicate certain aspects that were satisfyingly simple and linear. For me, at least, I loved Rome 1 because of how simple and down-to-it it was, and these new functions seem to kind of annoy me in a certain way. It's not just about me, but this review is, so personally I expected a fresh coat of paint and maybe an oil change, not a mismatched car panel that you ordered off of Craigslist and now I look like every illegal construction worker around your in-construction-cookie-cutter suburbia home lot, but the engine still runs so it's good!!!!!!

At least they made some improvements off the engine, but the colors seem too vibrant for me as well, I don't know, just not my cup of tea.

Not worth the obscene price of 30 dollars. I thought it would just be a much more aesthetically pleasing RTW1, but it was a mess. Plus it's a Kaczynski special with the sudden explosion of storage this has to take up compared to the OG one.

The price was so high that I didn't feel it would be justified to pay that much for an old game. Finally I saw it on sale, and purchased it.

Now to the review itself:

To start things off I need to mention that I do not enjoy Rome 2. I feel like it doesn't have the familiar Total War feeling, the graphics are better but still in a way a lot worse. The game also has too much everyghint.
IMO Rome remastered is basically the same game, with Rome 2's negative aspects. Literally, it feels like playing Rome 2.
Rome 1 had an amazing feeling, just like Medieval 2, but this remastered version has taken it away completely, and just kind of mashed it together with Rome 2.
To me these aspects from Rome 2 are just the things I dislike in the game, so the remastered version was basically a ruined version of a good old game.

So TLDR of the negatives
-They basically tried making it into Rome2. They added all the crappy things from Rome 2, but not the good things
-Expensive
-The feeling is NOTHING like the good old games had (Rome, Medieval 2 etc)
-The catapults SUCK. How bad you ask? I've never seen anything like that before. They will miss 9/10 shots from a good range. They are terrible.

None. You're better off just playing Rome 2, or the old Rome Total War.

It has not.

I *love* the original Rome Total War. When I got this, I hoped that it would be a re-mastered version of what I loved. Instead, it has worse UI, needless friction, and the battles are worse than the game from 20 years ago. 
All I wanted was the old game with some AI improvements. Instead, I'd rather play the original to avoid needless frustration.

For instance, in the old version, when you ordered your soldiers to march forward, they MARCHED forward in FORMATION. Now, they RUN forward so you need to order them to walk. But worse, they do not run in formation. They break formation to form a single, strategically disadvantageous line.
Why even bother putting your soldiers in battle formation before the battle? They just automatically form into a pointless line every time I order them forward.

A true Total War title, and a shining example of what a Remaster should be. They managed to stay true to the original experience, whilst adding some great (optional) quality of life improvements that make the game feel more modern. It also runs much better on modern pcs (getting around 200 fps whilst the original Rome 1 still maxes out at 30-40fps on the same pc), and modern screens. It  feels just as amazing as what playing Rome 1 felt like when it came out back in 2004.

Rome 1 Remastered finally offers what I expected when I bought Rome 2 back in 2013. Rome 2 is so bad that is both the first and last game I pre-ordered. It single handedly convinced me to never pre-order a single game again. Rome 1 finally offers what I had been hoping for, after a long wait of almost 8 years.

On top of that, purchasing the Remaster essentially gets you 9 games for the price of 1: The OG Rome 1, BI and Alexander, the Remastered OG (the original experience with remastered graphics) Rome 1, BI and Alexander, as well as the Remastered+ (updated, rebalanced and including new features) Rome 1, BI and Alexander.

It improves the game it is remastering in nearly every way, has it so that most of the big changes can be easily toggled and offers a lot of support for its community. There is really nothing wrong with this remaster and there is not really any reasons to buy the original game over this version. 

This remaster of Rome is an improvement over the original in every way. Basic features such as a menu to transfer followers & retainers between characters, more information screens, and improved army pathing significantly improve the campaign experience. Both the battle and campaign map AI have been improved to be more challenging without just giving cheats making the game more challenging without being unfair. Factions no longer churn out broken armies with lots of incendiary pigs & war dogs and the AI better responds to basic hammer & anvil tactics. Rome is still obscenely powerful and destined to dominate, but other AI factions put up much more of a fight so there is more faction diversity in a campaign. The remaster has a lot more details such as units having far more unique features to them such as units changing their looks based on the region where they were recruited (ethnically diverse legions in Africa, etc), every faction having its own unique campaign start and end animations, and more historical retainers. Everything added to the game is an improvement, but more importantly the game is not fundamentally transformed by its changes. 

Nearly all the changes added by the remaster are optional and can be toggled on or off individually. Everything from innocuous additions like the ethnicity of soldiers within a unit changing based on their area of recruitment to the new population mechanics and the addition of merchants can be toggled at the start of campaigns. Playing with both the Medieval 2-style merchants and the old population mechanics of the original game where the exact population is withdrawn from a city’s population is allowed.  Having issues with any of the remaster changes is kind of pointless as pretty much any of them can be turned off with ease without affecting the rest of the game. Players can fully embrace all of the remaster changes, play with a mix of both old & new  features or just play the game exactly like original Rome with better graphics/compatability.  This setup serves everybody. 
 
This remaster adds the Steam Workshop support and it makes a huge difference. Most of the active modders for the original game have either migrated over to the remaster or have had their works ported over for the remaster. This includes legendary mods like Roma Surrectum, Chivalry Total War, Europa Barbororoum, Mundus Magnus and others. There are many lesser known mods that have not been ported over that may justify getting the original game, but most of the top mods have been ported. With the Steam workshop that means no more risky .Zip files, installers and searching through fan sites to install multiple patches. Just hit subscribe to begin playing mods that have been worked on regularly for decades.  

This is everything you could ask for from a proper Remaster. It preserves the games excellence and adds alot. The game even comes with hundreds of achievements.",1669007411,1669007411,True,31,3,0.743495821952819824,0,True,False,False

It was a beloved Christmas present for me back then. This was back before game systems automatically recorded the hours you spent playing a game. I also bought Rome: Total War: Barbarian Invasion as one of the first games I spent my own savings on. The Rome: Total War: Alexander is the one part of the trio I didn't have experience on of the original games in this remaster. My local game store did not stock it and this was back when you mostly bought computer games in person in a physical store. 

Total War: Rome Remastered is exactly what it says in the title. It is a remastered version of an incredibly fun game to play. They have even added the option to play the games exactly like the original or with a few quality of life features thanks to them having the time to clean up bits of the old game code as they made it able to work on modern computers. Personally, I would recommend playing with all the remastered rule options as these get rid of many points that were aggravating in the original version.

Graphics for the game are good. They've clean up graphics for modern systems making images sharper along with a few little polishes here and there that just couldn't be done with the average computer back in the day. The User Interface for both the campaign and the battles is a step up from the original UI while maintaining the general style of the game. However, one should keep in mind that the graphics are faithful to the source material even with the clean up. That source material is 18 years old. Anyone used to Total War: Rome II or Total War: Attila graphics will find the graphics of Total Ware: Rome Remastered to be simpler and in less detail than they are used to in later Total War games. 

Game play is where this game shines. You can customize many things when starting a campaign such as whether or not you need a governor in a province to build buildings and recruit units. You can also set the difficulty levels for your battles and your campaign map separately. This is great if you are good at one part of the game, but not at other parts of the game. The User Interface gives you what you need to start planing your moves. There is also a good deal of humor in the game that will leave you either chuckling in amusement or shaking your head in disbelief. Egypt for example has its looks and units lifted right out of the Bronze Age. Another example is that some units you can command on the battlefield were never really used in real life battles like gladiators.    

However, for all the good points in Total War: Rome Remastered the game does have its points that can be frustrating. Many of these points were reworked or improved upon in later editions of the Total War franchise. An example from the campaign part of the game is the Horde mechanic in Barbarian Invasions. You have no control over what units your faction creates when it hordes. The only way to replenish units for your armies as a horde is via mercenaries with expensive upkeep. An example from the battle part of the game is when units will sometimes path to targets in strange manners when you give them a new target in a different direction from what they were facing.      

If you loved this game when the original version came out wish you could play it again, buy this game. If you are a fan of the Total War series and want a good 'historical' Total War game then get this game. Any fan of strategy games whether the game is set on the battlefield or is in a more traditional 4x style should put this game immediately on their wish list if they cannot put it in their shopping cart. If they are the type of person who wants to wait for a great sale before getting games on their wish list they will find themselves wishing that sale came sooner.",1668922694,1668952394,True,10,0,0.622874796390533447,0,True,False,False

PRO;

- Completely new textures, everything is shiny and 'modern' (yet don't need a 3080 to run it at 1440p)
- Unit balancing was a GOOD idea
- More action packed battles (AI is more agressive than before)
- Traders are fun  ^^
- FINALLY diplomacy makes sense
- Stable gameplay ( I didn't have any crash yet played since the beta )
- Mods... MODS.. MOOOODS !!!
- You can make Rome great again!!!!!!!!!

Con;

- Pathfinding is still bad
- Cav charges sometimes ineffective (Ex. beaten army flee still cav units just going around them)
- It's complex yet easy (Endgame is still fun and challenging)
- Battle animations looks goofy at present days :D   (BUT its just NOSTALGIA for me )

The UI. Oh wow, the UI. I must have played every TW game made to date, and the first time I play each of them, I feel familiar with the UI by the time I finish my first session. But this one defeated me. The icons are a nonsensical, interchangeable mess, and break every convention of TW. Need an example? The icons on the unit recruitment cards for unit cost and unit upkeep are THE EXACT SAME ICON. Which number is the cost, and which is the upkeep?  Your guess is as good as mine!

Then there is the AI. What a brain-dead mess. I attacked an under-defended enemy city in easy marching distance of a far superior enemy army, and they simply ignored me while I besieged and conquered their city the following turn. Later, when that same army besieged my city,  I fought that battle on the battle map. Guess which units they decided to assign to battering ram duty? Their archers! Like... wtf?

It's a shame, because this game really deserved better than a redesign by a team that I would question ever played a TW game at all.

Másodszor: Nem rossz, bár szerintem kicsit túl bonyolult az UI és kevésbé szép, spártaibb és bonyibb, viszont vannak hasznos funkciók. Az, hogy az ügynököket a célt kijelölve is lehet mozgatni engem inkább zavar. Csata előtt nem lehet már menteni. A csata képernyőn nem tudom lekérni az ellenfél felismert egységeinek részletesebb statjait, csak előtte (ez valamennyire életszerű, mert ha én támadok, akkor ezt tudhatom a nagytérképről, fordítva nem - csak megszoktam, hogy a régi rome-ban nem így volt).

Ami jobb: át tudom egyszerűbben pakolni a ""követőket"" (retinue) és a TAB-os térképen vannak nagyon hasznos infók pélldául arról, hogy az adott területnek mennyi a gazdasága, alap farmképessége, bányászata. Az, hogy a hotkey-ek mások lettek alapvetően nem zavarna, ha lenne benne ráció, hogy a csata közbenieknek micsoda a hotkey-je. A WASD-os kamera mozgás nem rossz egyébként, meg a kicsit több szabadsági fok a kamera nézeten, de kicsit gyorsabb a forgás mint szerintem kéne legyen.

A diplomácia jobbnak tűnik. Bár lehet hogy átesett a ló túlsó oldalára és túl könnyű, de a játék maga nem tűnt ""túlkönnyűnek"", így ez okés valszeg.

Irtózatosan sok helyet foglal viszont és volt egy fagyásom is. Továbbá nekem eleve csak windowed indult el (linuxról nyomom - egyébként tök jó, hogy van natív linux változat, meglepően jónak tűnik).",1665670251,1665670251,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All of these new features and graphical improvements can be tweaked to your liking on the game's settings. Don't like the new colors? Switch them off. Want to turn off certain new features, like Merchants? No problem. It's a very neat package that gives you a lot of freedom to customize your experience to best suit your taste.

Only gripe I have with it is that, in my humble opinion, the campaign UI is pretty bad compared to the original. Kinda looks like something you'd find on a mobile game at times. And the new unit icons, while useful (if you REALLY need to be aware of *every* single modifier during a battle), clutter half your screen and, again, look like something straight outta a phone app. That being said, I do appreciate some of the new tabs (like agent hubs) that help you keep track of all the pieces in your arsenal, which can be quite a few once you get a few turns into a campaign.

Overall, pretty good remaster. If you liked the original back in the day, you'll enjoy it. If you never played it before but wanted to check it out, now you can experience it at the best it's ever been. And if you feel nostalgic, the OG game is also included with the purchase of the remaster.

Its impossible to host games with Random players, if this was to prevent Clan based communities I'm afraid this has done the opposite as you can only formulate games as a clan community now, we need a chat lobby for multiplayer. Its frustrating because you provided a chat for hosted games but could have made a chat lobby. My Critic of this game would be this, with it its golden without it its not even got the same amount of features as the original which does have a chat lobby and a map editor as well. 

Now to the review, Remastered is a good game for single player and with its Mod support its much better then  the original Vanilla so its not all doom and gloom as its very easy to apply and switch Mods also the Camapign overhaul is very nice as you can play on VH/VH with a nice aggressive Ai. However the Vanilla has a much better Multiplayer Scene on weekends which is still alive even today on nights 6-12 PM where as the Remastered literally has nothing its barren because of the Chat Lobby not being apart of the game. I rate the game 6/10 compared to Vanilla it become 10/10 when you add that chat lobby.

Please I beg you add a Chat Lobby soon as a final update and the Multiplayer will come alive. I'm an avid fan of Rome Total War and have player the game ever since I could get hands on it around the age of 7. Its Rome Total Wars Birthday today September 22nd, please I beg you hear my comment. I'm celebrating the game today and want to see it in its perfect form. 

Thankyou for reading this review if you have, I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm screaming at Feral but I just want to see this game in its perfect form.

I was looking through my steam games over a long weekend, deciding what to do when I saw this game and figured I’d boot it up and see if it wants to work. To my surprise it did. 

When I bough this game, I had a lot of fun playing it, as the original was a game I owned and had wanted to learn how to play for many years but never did. It’s a fantastic remaster since the original I’ll say is a fair bit dated. It did come out in 2004 after all. 

Then it just would not launch for about six months to a year. 

I spent a long time trying to get one my newfound favorite games to work. I troubleshooted it down to the game launcher, but couldn’t solve whatever problem it had. 

Then one day it decided to work again. I played it for a week straight, now I’m here. 

With the technical problems stated, I have to say it is a great game. Very addictive as well, I’ve never had a game eat up time like this one does, it feels like you sit down and instantly an hour goes by. 

It looks great, plays great, dosent crash very often. ( I believe I’ve had less than 3 crashes, sometimes loading go screens will hang for a long time and I think it’s gunna crash and it dosent )

If you’re someone whose put off by the age of the original for various reasons(It crashes a LOT in my experience) I highly recommend this remaster at the right price.



TL:DR It’s a great remaster of a very old and dated ( but still very good ) game , I just hope it dosent give you the technical problems it gave me.",1662490598,1662490598,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The sad thing is, besides the Steam workshop being available for this game and the updated graphics, this ""remaster"" is inferior to the original. Out of everything there is to complain about this game, the thing that pisses me off the most is that the path-finding is somehow worse than the original. So I have Shogun 2 loading screens, delayed response from my units, and horrendous path-finding. I lost battles because my units were f*ucking about. See I like to play as the Greeks a lot, and holy sh*t is it bad. The Greek factions have to be the most infuriating factions to play as because of the path-finding. The phalanx units in the original would shift around sometimes, but at least they were in formation with their pikes down and when I would order back into position they would stay. In this ""remaster"" The phalanx units just f*ck about when you tell them to lower their pikes or re-position them in phalanx formation. For example, I am defending a city and the enemy has used sappers to put a hole in my wall. I would, in response, rush some phalanx units to defend that hole in the wall. The units reach the area and when I tell them to get into Phalanx formation they would mesh into a clusterf*ck and then slowly get into formation. By the time they get into formation the enemy units are trashing my units. Also, prepare to kill your liver with extreme intakes of alcohol since settlement battles are horrendous because of said path-finding.

There were some good ideas, especially with settlement management, and they could've added mechanics from Medieval 2 Total War. I have not played since May 28, so I haven't experienced the crashing that other people are talking about. Also f*ck CA for removing the original off the Steam store because they want to sell this half baked ""remaster."" I would only call this an inferior re-skin. I was actually excited for this game but I forgot that CA wants to make as much money as possible while putting in as little effort as possible; but I thought remastering a game as old as Rome Total War wouldn't be so hard. This ""remaster"" is just such a waste of potential.

Until they, at least, fix the path-finding I cannot recommend this game. You will lose battles not because of your strategy, but because of game breaking bugs.

The UI was turning me off, massively and I had one example of utterly horrible pathfinding. Since then though I have tuned the UI more towards my liking. I set the scale to 120% (seriously, everyone needs to do this), turned off the arrow tracers, turned off the scroll to tactical map, turned off the default run setting, and turned off the unit status circles. If you hate the UI, do these things and give it another go. For me, this solved most of my UI woes.

The sounds could use a little work as they are currently very faint (marching, weapons clashes). There are some other bugs that I have personally not encountered yet and hopefully they will be fixed.

Overall, I would recommend this game to both old and new players alike. You need to change the UI though as default it is bad. My campaign as the Brutii is going well and I am reliving the old days.

I am changing this to a negative review purely based around the fact that I just cannot stand the UI changes that were made. For me, this makes the game just a chore to play.

While the stock game of Rome Remastered on itself deserves the current 77% approval rating, you cannot ignore that they have given modders the tools needed to not just quickly port their old Rome mods over, but to really (and I mean REALLY) enhance them even more.

RTR: Imperium Surrectum is the total Rome Total War experience I have ever hoped for.

Astheticly it looks like Rome 2 (preview vids, not actual lol).

Campaign strategically it is a extremely slow campaign.  260 BC to 50 BC, even playing your hardest, you grow at about the size historically Rome expanded.

Easily near 1000 settlements.  It takes a lot of battles and time to grow.  Each settlement taken FEELS impactful from your very first one to your hundredth.

Wars are not won in one campaign.  Even if you are winning, you are feeling the financial strain of training and retraining troops to sustain it as much as the AI feels and sues for peace. You are missing out on building up your empire and see your faction falling in the world's rankings as the war rages. You are actually thankful for peace so you can recover.

Battle wise it's not too quick, not too long.  They are a good challenge.  You are not fighting full stacks against full stacks most of the time as the global economy is tough.  You have to preserve as many troops as possible in every fight and it feels just right.

Anyone reading this who enjoyed Rome Total War, but was majorly let down by Rome 2 and still not fully satisfied with Rome 2 at current version and mods - Get this game so you can get the RTR: Imperium Surrectum mod.

A remaster should keep to the original and improve upon it. This version has bugs from the original and new ones. Pathfinding is terrible and sometimes units are unresponsive. The new UI is bad, it's cluttered and unappealing visually as is the world map. Some units don't even work properly, a sure way to defeat a phalanx unit is to rear charge them with cavalry. The cavalry gets melted as though you've charged from the front. The graphics are a bit of a hit and miss. While there's some improves to the textures, many of the unit models looks too saturated and everything looks cartoonish.

The carnal sin of this game is it's size. At the time of writing this review it is larger than Warhammer II and it's not even half the game Warhammer II is. This travesty is currently 73.74 GB, Warhammer II with all DLC is 59.56 GB, Rome II is 33.35 GB and Shogun 2 with all DLC is 22.98 GB.

Many aspects are dated and some are just out right bad, but there is a reason many long time fans of total war are disappointed with new titles. Newer historical titles may have much more advanced campaign mechanics than rome, but rome has manual replenishment and recruitment in settlements. While these mechanics probably wouldn't work for the warhammer series, they are major reasons the newer historical titles (at least rome 2, I never bothered with the other ones) are worst than the classics. With automatic replenishment and recruitment in armies you never need to return your armies to friendly settlements making the entire campaign less strategic and engaging. In rome 1, you have to plan your conquest as over expanding can leave your armies far away from recruitment buildings and make it take too long for reinforcements to arrive. You have to think about when to return your army to a settlement, often one far away, as leaving to soon leaves your border settlements open to your neighbors but leaving to late leaves your army unable to protect your settlements or themselves. These factors make battles more impactful as losing troops means returning to a settlement that can replace them. and  All of this strategy and planning is almost entirely skipped in rome 2, where an army just has to be in friendly territory to replenishment and recruitment. rome  also has advantages over other classic total war titles. While it may not be nearly as polished as shogun 2, it has way more faction variety. So the original rome is good, but that doesn't mean the remaster is. However, the remaster is good, it updates the graphics and adds quality of life features while not ruining anything from the original. It would be really nice if the ai and pathfinding was improved more but that would probably require a new engine, and a new engine would make it more of a remake than a remaster.",1658016008,1658016008,True,5,0,0.588528692722320557,0,True,False,False

Od razu też wgrałem moda Imperium Surrectum autorstwa ludzi którzy kiedyś odpowiadali za moda Total Realism. 

I szczerze od razu się ucieszyłem że nie posłuchałem mędzących recenzentów. 

Gra jest świetna dla każdego kto interesuje się/ lubi historie antyku. Warstwa graficzna jest oczywiście gorsza niż w Warhammerze ale spokojnie daje się grać i nie razi oczu. Czyli gramy w grę ze zwykłą grafiką, bez żadnych fajerwerków ale w świecie antycznego Rzymu a nie fantasy. 

Od razu możemy przypomnieć sobie dlaczego Rome 2 był tak fatalnie oceniony. Konieczność rotowania jednostek, brak superherosów ze świata Warhammerowego fantasy. Konieczność rotowania jednostek (nie wejdziemy sobie do pierwszego lepszego miasta żeby uzupełnić straty ani nie uzupełnią się same) nakazuje planować kampanię. Pojedyńcze miasto nie wystawi nagle z kosmosu 2 pełnych armii jak bywało w Rome 2. Budowanie siły gospodarczej zajmuje czas. Uzupełnianie jednostek odbywa się z ludności miasta więc szczególnie na początku trzeba zwracać uwagę na straty. Co z tego że wygramy bitwę jeśli zginie nam 1000 legionistów których na dodatek możemy uzupełnić jedynie w Rzymie?

Gra bezwarunkowo do polecenia dla każdego miłośnika antyku. Z modem Imperium Surrectum deklasuje absolutnie niewypał jakim był Rome 2. 

W grze brakuje bez wątpienia - jakichś dodatków ustrojowych (choćby podstawy z Imperator Rome Paradoxu) i niewolników. Ale Rome Remastered to przecież remaster a nie remake więc nie ma co narzekać. Ot, po prostu szkoda że ich nie ma.

1) The Rome Total War part

and

2) The Remaster part

1)Rome total war:

Rome total war for its time was a completely revolutionary game, graphically and mechanically. The only comparison that comes to mind would be Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It truly evolved the genre of strategy games to a next level, with massive detailed armies classing with eachother, mechanics that encourage actual strategic engagement and not a ""my army is stronger so I instantly win"" sort of engagement, the management aspect is cool to engage with and a variety of factions of different cultures and backgrounds to explore. However the question is, does its overall appeal hold up to this day? Well... yes and no. I certainly remember having barrels of fun with this game as a kid however now the game feels much more stale. Perhaps this is just me however it feels like many parts of the game are rather dated. The diplomacy is unworkable and pretty much a joke. The late game is a painful drag I wouldn't wish to my worst enemy, the path-finding is ridicolously bad and the enemy AI is hillariouisly easy to cheese, something you will end up doing A LOT if you wanna get through the late game nightmare. If you are new in the Total War genre I don't think I can in good consious recommend this game to you. However if you are a vet looking for a more retro experience I can certainly give a thumbs up to this game for you.

2) The Remaster:

Here is the thing. I think a remaster should be judged primarily on the basis of if it makes the original game experience better or not. And in this case yes, this remaster is actually decent.It massively improves the already pretty good graphics of the original and it introduces many new elements in the game for the sake of providing some quality of life. On top of that for people who are more attached to the original but still want to play with improved graphics the game allows you to reverse (almost) all changes made in the remaster back to the original. However.... We need to mention the elephant in the room.... and that is the dreaded UI... A lot has been said about the UI and honestly I can't help but agree. The new UI is gonna make you suffer if you are someone who wants to re-experience Rome Total War. It is confusing, the font is tiny, everything is all over the place and if you are autist like me you will feel kinda horrible seeing your old favorite game with a new UI. HOWEVER (and that is a big however) it is not the end of the world. The new UI can be stomached after a while. That original feeling of discomfort doesn't stay for long. In addition to that the new UI offers much more information the old one simply didn't have, making the game much less esoteric and easy to navigate, which is something I consider a bonus. Finally I would like to also mention that the unit pathfinding has not been fixed from the original, honestly it kinda feels worse some times however enemy AI has become slightly smarter, even though it is still easy af to cheese it.

Conclusion:

Honestly this is a tough one for me. I sort of feel like Rome Total War in general is pretty dated and the remaster doesn't do nearly enough to alleviate that, even though it kinda tries. I guess if you have a choice between this and the original I would personally pick up this. However it does leave a lot to be desired. If I could leave a mixed review I would but for now I Will recommend it since there is really nothing that ""ruins"" it for me.",1656066559,1656066559,True,69,0,0.82460939884185791,0,True,False,False

I absolutely loved the original, and there are some changes in this version that are really appreciated. The fact I've struggled through so many issues to get 106 hours of playtime shows that.

But I can't recommend it. Not until they fix the crashes.

There's far to many of them:
Go to fight a field battle manually? 50/50 that it crashes. I've lost so many troops having to auto resolve fights i know i could win easily.
Go to attack a city? exact same thing.
And gods forbid you actually attempt to end your turn. I've had to abandon 3 different campaigns due to them crashing when i go to end turn somewhere between turns 25 and 35.

I'm sure by now Feral is fed up of receiving crash reports from me. And I'm fed up sending them. As much as I hate to have to say it, I'm not gonna be playing again until they fix this.

In order to play any of the recent Rome games, I found myself having to do less exciting things and Rome Remastered has focussed more on gameplay features without to much hassle and unnecessary complexity. Also the style and artwork still seem better than Rome 2, less cartoony and better unit cards.

Leave the core game alone for the most part and give players the option to disable the any new additions or enhancements that you do add.

Total War Rome is one of the greatest PC strategy games of all time and I spent thousands of hours in it when it first released. When I repurchased the game on steam it disappointed me how the game ran so poorly on modern PC's. This remaster fixes that and for that reason alone it's a thumbs up for me. 

Some people will complain about changes the developer didn't make. For example the unit AI and pathfinding in siege battles appears to be unchanged and is as bad as it ever was. But that's just what TW: Rome was like. While many of us Total War fans complain about the new games; going back a couple decades can be a reminder as to how many things really have improved. 

For me though, it's perfect and exactly what I was looking for. I personally turn all the new enhancements off. The addition of merchants in particular kind of irks me because I never liked that mechanic in Medieval 2 but once again, I'm free to turn it off which I do. I'll probably play around with them in the future but Rome TW in it's original form is that comfy blanket that has holes in it but you still love, warts and all.

A++ work, Feral Interactive. Looking forward to a Medieval 2 remaster.

Classic game. If you are into total war this really shows it's roots. 
Great historical battles. Great challenge to be had.
If you must know I never played Original. It still holds up really well today and is refreshing for Total war.
With all three titles Rome , Barbarian Invasion, and Alexander. It's I'd say completely awesome collection. Great challenge to be had in the historical battles.
Honestly, Worth full price. If you don't mind it being a dated game it's still full of content. Too much almost :)
UI 
The UI is mmm. Great aside from the Unit circles. You can hide them. so they only show up when you hold Space.  Honestly, they are great for being easy to see unit status. quickly . They are great but aesthetically they look out of place.
But they are ugly and do kinda look like something off a mobile game. But, yeah. Super useful Better than most tell you lots quickly. Unlike Attila the UI looks clean but, the Icons are hard to click on. Little status is actually visible. 
Shogun 2 you'd have to read a bit more but it told you lots if you were not on battle realism. Rome Remastered UI tells you lots quick. Other than the circles. It looks pretty good. 
I prefer them to look like Banners. Maybe have better symbology.  It still has banners. But I'd like to see unit strength and ammo count on the Banner. Along with Moral. All on the banner. Rather than floating circles. 

Gameplay
Solid. What you'd expect. If you've never played Rome1.
Well. The balance is something to be said. In battle it can be brutal
Campaign, I've seen some good AI. In battle I've seen good AI as well. 

As for Campaign. I didn't see Armenia at first. But now I do + there are really good factions all playable. All of them feel quite unique in some way. - Roman are pretty similar but will play different due to your location. All the Factions look great. 
Unlike Shogun (wow something this did better than Shogun) although shogun Clans had unique bonuses which is really awesome.
Diplomats require you to actually send to negotiate. 
There is also a fog of war on Campaign map so Settlements / cities are not visible. 

Feels like the brood war of totalwar. It's great

It's actually been a really good re-release. Low bugs, 
Not many complaints here. It's Rome 1. Definitive edition pretty much.

A year and several patches later, however, I think it can stand as an example of a remaster done right.

Only a couple things count as downgrades in my opinion, namely the UI and some tweaks to agents. Plus you're getting RTW, BI, and Alexander all together. Overall, I think the good pretty heavily outweighs the bad.

The game wasn't as moddable at launch as Feral had indicated, which was a big point against it and them. Those issues have been fixed, however.

Gives you some options to change remastered changes back to original (Note: They hid some of the remaster/original toggle options pretty well so it is there, but its not obvious)

Neutral: UI has an adjustment period (its functional, and even does some things well, but needs quality of life improvements) Diverse recruiting (Recruit in greece and your units look greek. I personally like it, its cool to see militia or auxillary units look different, but I will say its a little strange to see all black legions for example *romans weren't exactly a diverse or culturally accepting crowd and I could see how that would be a little off putting to some people. Unfortunately you cannot turn this off if it does bother you).

Cons: Walls have some weird issues that need to be fixed. I spent 20 minutes just trying to get my legions off a wall and another 10 watching them go back and forth through a gate or face plant until every unit was off the wall. Even then, they would often turn around mid combat because one man got stuck somewhere and the entire unit was trying to form up around them before getting halfway there and turning back around. I've also noticed your units won't fight back on walls unless you explicitly tell them. Its a bigger issue when youre defending (I've lost a whole unit of legionary cohort to iberian infantry just because I didn't tell them to fight back...which should go without saying). These were nowhere near as bad as they were in the originals (which i still play) so I'm not sure what happened here, but its honestly the only real issue I have.

Gallic light horsemen are cutting through *braced* Hastati like a hot knife through butter, and then I lose 70 routing troops in seconds.

I'm done. These glaring issues have shattered the goodwill that the new and revamped features of the Remaster garnered for me. I'm now going to wait for the seemingly upcoming Medieval 2 Remastered, and watch from a safe distance...

--ORIGINAL REVIEW--
This is a close call on whether to give this a thumbs up or thumbs down at the time of writing this. For context, I currently have 16 hours invested in a Hard/Hard Brutii campaign, on Turn 57, with Ultra unit size.

From my experience so far, I've enjoyed the redone UI with its appearance and quality of life improvements. The agent tracker and idle character warnings have helped me keep things active when I want them to be; but then, on the other hand, of course being yelled at about armies/agents I'm intentionally keeping idle becomes annoying. The followers management screen is far more effective than the old system, and I find the new merchants mechanics enjoyable and (at least for me) they work consistently with no issues.

Every single open-field battle I've fought has been smooth and efficient for me to fight, with no performance issues on Ultra unit size, and with the ability to utilize the more modern controls. I've enjoyed all but one of the open-field battles, the one outlier simply being an untenable battle attempt where I was stuck downhill and caught without reinforcements. However, almost every single SIEGE battle I've fought has been plagued by the typical RTW pathfinding that we have been told has been improved upon. I don't see any evidence of improvement, and in fact it sometimes feels worse than it ever did before. I'm giving Feral the benefit of the doubt that this will be more thoroughly addressed and adjusted in patches in the first few weeks/months, but as of right now it's a serious downside.

Then there's the improved campaign AI. From what I've seen, it's largely...inconsistent. First, the pros:

Macedon and the Greek Cities, the natural first enemies for the Brutii, have been more aggressive and efficient as promised with the remaster AI. I was encountering two full-stack Macedonian armies rounded out with Phalanx Pikemen and Greek Cavalry by 20 turns in. 90 percent of my campaign has involved Macedon and I kicking each other's butts up and down Illyria and western Greece in a very challenging back-and-forth with very intense and pivotal battles. I negotiated peace with the Greek Cities in the first 15-20 turns or so to solely focus Macedon, and the AI have honored our truce ever since. Meanwhile, the Greek Cities apparently got busy taking over all of Asia Minor from Pontus, Armenia, and the now-dead Seleucids. Germania, meanwhile, steamrolled Dacia and is now at war with me over Illyria with VERY strong armies coming for me at the same time I'm still trying to at least curb Macedon's aggression. Gaul has been very powerful and very stable (I'll get into this later), and their incursions into Illyria have had to be repulsed as well. All in all, I've been forced to invest huge amounts of denarii and manpower simply to stay alive. It can be frustrating, but I appreciate that I have to keep my head on a swivel far more often than at this stage in most other TW campaigns I've played.

Very good campaign AI there, right? Now, on the other hand...

The other Roman houses (S.P.Q.R. doesn't count because, well, they never really do anything anyway). For no apparent reason, the Roman houses seem almost brain-dead. By Turn 57 in this campaign:

-The Julii have still not taken Patavium or Mediolanum from Gaul, even while having an army of ~1800-2000 just...standing still between Ariminum and Segesta that could EASILY move up to siege. Gaul, not having to worry about defending against the Julii, have therefore been able to grow as stable and strong as they are, and are repeatedly laying siege to both Segesta and Ariminum, only to be pushed back by that one Julii army and the S.P.Q.R. (at least the AI Romans are properly covering each other and defending Italy, also working as advertised with the remaster AI. I consider this a minor plus).
-The Scipii have still not taken Lilybaeum from Carthage, and have maintained a small army of 3 units in an ambush outside of Caralis for...40 turns. The Julii took Caralis from Carthage shortly after the ambush was first set, and the Scipii have NEVER moved it away. About turn 40 or so I saw a Scipii army isolated up by Germania for no reason (this was before Germania declared war on me and therefore became an enemy of Rome. Therefore, what were they doing that far north, trespassing in neutral territory?).
-The Scipii haven't even tried to sail troops past Lilybaeum to North Africa, either. Instead, they stood idly by while NUMIDIA has taken ALL of Carthage's mainland territory. (Is Carthage AI brain-dead too?)

The Julii and Scipii have 7 regions combined. Between all my warring, I hold 7 regions by myself. At this rate, the Civil War will be one tenth as difficult as my current two-front war with Germania/Gaul and Macedon is. I'm noticing they are both developing their infrastructure at least, because they are training Principes they proceed to never do anything with.

In conclusion, I am very narrowly rating this a thumbs-up instead of a thumbs-down, because I have no quarrel with the revamped UI, and the new campaign AI is properly fun to deal with when it's working as intended. To answer the question ""Is it worth buying right now?"", I would say that depends on your opinion of the AI performance and/or UI with its quality of life improvements. If you don't like them right now or don't feel like they do enough to help make the game enjoyable, then wait a few weeks or months to see if they've improved and/or changed. If you do like them right now, I'd say it's worth buying FOR THE HALF-OFF PRICE if you have the loyalty bonus from owning the digital release of the RTW Collection. DEFINITELY not worth buying for the full $30, not in its current state. In the meantime, I'm optimistic that these issues addressed here can be resolved in the next few weeks or couple months. I'll keep myself busy between this Brutii campaign, and one or two more base campaigns as someone not Roman (preferably further from Rome) to see if there's just generally an issue with ALL the Roman houses under AI control. This remaster is a good start, say, a C-plus. It's gonna need some time to reach A-plus.

I would mostly consider this remaster to be faithful to the original in generally all aspects, I am only dissapointed in the ""update"" of the UI, menus and loading screens. Fortunately the devs opened up full modding tools (something not done in newer titles) so there are already a large quantity of mods that revert most of these faults back to how it was in the original game. There is also already massive realism overhauls like Rome Total Realism and such that improve combat, formations, and the appearance of troops and factions (making egypt greek for example).AI of course is still lacking on occasion too, but there is only so much that can be done here unfortunately. The engine has been fixed so thousands of troops no longer destroy beefy modern PCs, and there are still graphical mods to improve (and maybe to break your beefy pc if you wish :p) even more upon what improvements have already been made. There is backwards compatibility with campaigns running on the ORIGINAL game (check out a few guides on how to move your saves to the remaster!), as well as toggle options in the menu to switch between all the new remastered settings and the original Rome settings. Lastly, they recently allowed achievements with mods now, and there is this interesting little mechanic where the ethnicity of your troops will depend on where they were recruited from (for example Romans recruited in northern Italy will be pasty white, but Romans recruited in north africa will be much uh darker). 

TLDR, I rate this as excellent because it still bears the soul of all the older total wars where the campaign wasn't utterly ruined, each faction was a paid DLC, and battles turned into 5 minute arcade games, and it is able to also fix many of the issues that plagued the older titles (namely engine, faction limit, and graphics).

They added the merchants mechanic from Medieval 2 (except the ones in this game are actually useful), which I think was a nice touch. Diplomacy also seems to be a lot less... weird, than in classic RTW; i.e, I haven't gotten a single ""please do not attack, accept or we will attack"" request yet, in nearly 150 hours of gameplay. Protectorates are now somewhat more viable, with factions you are dominating more willing to make a deal with you rather than face extinction. Roman factions are still backstabbing A-holes, but hey, I'm chalking that one up to historical accuracy.

What I can't chalk up to historical accuracy is that (at least on hard and very hard, can't speak for the lower difficulties as I haven't tried them yet) the AI seems waaaay too hyperfocused on attacking the player, like, even more so than in classic RTW. You'll have the Julii completely ignoring or even forging alliances with the Gauls, and the Scipiones ignoring the Carthaginians for the sole purpose of dog-piling the player faction, regardless of how impractical a target your faction currently is. Playing as Carthage in particular is a bit of a slog, as you're spread thin from the very beginning, and, quite literally, the whole world is out to get you. If your faction starts with territory in the north or northwest, be prepared to fight full stacks of Hastati and basic Warbands ad nauseam in the early game. I don't typically mod TW games, but I'm fervently praying for a mod for this game that makes AI factions behave more naturally.

Volound was right, I called him dumb at first, he was right. Melkor was wrong. This games UI makes me want to blast my brains out, the way they made every unit so... unmanly and muscle from the original is to just make men look ""weak."" There are Black Romans and other African units in north africa even though it was white at this time, and do not give me the ""That's racist!!, this game is not historical."" just another thing to promote the anti white agenda. The path finding is even worse than the original. And the ai, oh god the ai... it just craps its self in battles. Not as bad as empire total war though. 

I am SO GLAD I did not preorder this. I should of refunded it... but I waited for mods. Till I realized, the ui is too bad. Mods are not going to fix that, legit mobile graphics and ui. What should I expect from a company basically owned by a toy making company who practically S**ts on their workers for a living. If you want to learn more reasons why Total War has become a massive failure ever since Empire Total War, check out Volound and the true og video. Why Empire Total War Failed.

I do not agree with Volounds ways of telling, as its very uncivil and down barbaric. But I will respect his views on the game as he is the only major one actually pointing out the wrong doings. Macadon is not doing it, Melkor, Legend of total war, etc. They just sit there and let it hit them. Melkor broke when he realized he was not getting anything and said he was going to leave. Only to come back till he gets collage. Honestly, I have nothing against Melkor personally. I like his content its just he is just too damn tame on Total War. Total Wars last success was Medieval 2 in my opinion. Shogun 2 is a good game but I just never like it. All units seemed... copy and pasted. Not a single different play style, while in Medieval. Even unmodded there are so many play styles as nations you can do.

Overall, this game is a 2/10 for me. 1 point for at least being enjoyable on some points... and one for modding. Rest I just do not care. At least it was not as big as a disappointment as JC4... because I had a feeling this would be crap.",1620253033,1649288318,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

To start, this game can be quite overwhelming initially, mainly due to the plethora of menus and screens you can click through, each being chock full of information. The tutorial does its best with trying to explain these menus and the mechanics of the game, but I am a firm believer that the best way to learn is to explore for yourself and learn as you go. This game is a refreshing take on the time period, especially after playing Rome II, and I really appreciate Rome being split into four factions (the 3 Roman houses and the Senate). This makes for a much more interesting and threatening civil war, as the other two houses expand and develop just as fast if not faster than you. 

This game is highly Rome-centric, they have the most diverse unit roster and I feel the most love went into their develop. However, the other factions in the game are just as interesting to play and come with their own host of challenges and triumphs. One of the greatest feelings is defeating a challenging AI faction and knowing that with the fall of their last settlement that you have unlocked their campaign. 

Some of my biggest gripes with the game has been how unbalanced the units can be. Barbarian warlords and the Brittania chariots absolutely devastated my armies as the Julii in the early game, no matter how deep my lines were or how many velites I had aiming at them. Using pikes while playing as Thrace feels like you're cheesing the game, and the AI can be absolutely relentless in their sieges (I had one city sieged several times by Gaul deathstacks in one turn). The autoresolve is not your friend and I highly recommend saving before you decide to use that function.

+Added merchants
+Three great games that used to be sold separately are neatly packed into one launcher
+Kept the old music and sounds(some of the best sound design and music in all of gaming imo)
+Battle map includes useful and clearly marked firing distances for ranged units
+Achievements(frankly if they updated the old games with just added achievements I wouldn't even bother playing this remaster)
+More playable factions

-They took the old version off of steam(scummy move!)
-MY BIGGEST ISSUE: Units DO NOT move as crisply and cleanly as they did in the old game, some units like chariots are much less useful due to their inability to move quickly, effectively and they die very easily. Same goes for cavalry to a lesser extent
-Graphic redesign of the UI, campaign map and battle often looks cartoony and uninspired, another review mentions how the color palate of the old game used to look charming, striking and regal. Gold and red intertwined with dark realistic contrasts, now replaced with soulless beiges and whites with smatterings of cheap color, kind of like a mobile game...
-UI is simply worse than the old game, I have for the most part gotten used to it but it's simply just more confusing and harder to navigate than the original even after almost 90 hrs

Ultimately the game has lost a lot of it's soul and, although it's the ""same game"", it's just not the same experience.

The main problem is the epileptic seizures this game presents with the screen flashing and vibrating out of insanity's ass. This wasn't a problem in the original and I can't look at this game without blinking with strain cause of how horrible the screen is trying to make me epileptic. 

The unit path finding are still the same where they go in a circle and reform in the longest way possible when they could turn right. walk. turn left. like in Rome 2. 

The maps haven't changed either and they are just as chaotic to traverse with the bulky building placements.

They could have made the maps more detailed and have different elevations and unique city defences, they could have also made the people in the unit have different faces instead of the same guy with a different skin of colour. Even the hairstyle is the same with only different colours. 

With other problems in the game that haven't been fixed or new problems because of bad coding Mods are the only real progress this game will get. 

Once old game ideas get used up from independent developers that were bought out by big, careless, unimaginative, corrupt, lawless, gambling, bureaucratic companies either new trash games will be made or remasters of the old games. This game was just given a new coat of skin with a nice big price-tag over it to lure the consumer into buying a great game from the great age of games that will only return when the big companies fall on their face.

""YOU DONE F*CKED IT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

Everything that worked perfectly in the original was tampered with, and the areas that needed improvement upon was untouched or made worse.

The only thing I can say that was improved is the graphics (obviously) and the frame rates.... But the positives end right then and there.

Here is a nice bulletin list organized for you all to follow:

- Searching and hosting matches on multiplayer is broken.  Desyncs and disconnections happen ad nauseum.  I managed to finish three 5-10 minute matches in a span of 4 hours.  That's 3.5 hours of me staring at the cluttered lobby.

- Speaking of the multiplayer lobbies, they decided to remove the public hub/main lobby chat due to the potential of offensive words being spoken....  So.... imagine being so arrogant, so tyrannical, so controlling of a developer, you decided to just strip one of Rome 1's core features away from the player base......Because of the fear of making someone offended.  Just blows my mind--THIS ALONE is worth getting a refund over.  Go woke, go broke, you jacka*ses.

- The AI here compared to the AI in the original Rome:  The difference is negligible.  There is practically zero difference on the AI behavior, some people even seem to think the AI got even worse than before.  

- THE PATH-FINDING PROBLEM STILL EXISTS AFTER 16 YEARS!  LOL

- The user interface......... Oh my god the UI......... What an utter disaster.  You certainly don't have to go far to find the numerous opinions everyone had on this subject... A complete lack of any organization for the layout.  It's set up like a cheap tablet game that you would buy for your 6 year old child.  Not only that, but they don't give us the choice to restore the original UI, and they stripped the ability to rebind important keys like guard mode, or fire at will!  Alt + 5?  How about the F key for FIRE at will?  What makes more sense to you?  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING??!  Modern gaming my a*s, are you KIDDING ME??

- The broken state of the gameplay is quite interesting too.  I find myself having to spam keys and buttons for a unit to act.  I notice there is more delay to the unit's movements.  It's like I'm playing Medieval 2.

- The replays are showing different outcomes.  Imagine getting an awesome decisive victory battle against another player, only to watch it and watch it play out in a completely different way.  Yeah, it's a buzz kill.

I could go on, and on, and on.  But I am tired of typing, and I'll assume this summary covers a majority of the issues.  Don't just read my review though, you'll find other people reporting crap that is broken that I haven't mentioned.  
So, 40 gigs for this?  No, stick with the 4 gigs of the original.  

This is a disgrace, and they have A LOT of work and patching to do to make me even consider forgiving them for robbing me.  (Refund was denied, just so you idiotic TW apologists and a*skissers are tracking).",1619820615,1647234226,False,36,1,0.619456827640533447,6,True,False,False

Do you expect me to say it's bad?

It's the first strategy game i ever played, one of the first video games i'd ever played.

Its quite possibly what you immediately think of when you hear the words 'total war'. It certainly is for me.

All the DLC, workshop support, all new textures, a little sprinkling of all the QoL features modern titles have, 38 factions, cross platform multiplayer, and as a little sweetener, the original and all its DLC.

It's the game we all know and love.

The original Rome: Total War had a main menu that was a striking gold-upon-red, with silhouettes of soldiers on the battlefield playing constantly. The remaster simply has a stereotypical roman marble menu while a slideshow of random images plays. Where the units in the original had their eyes shrouded in shadow, faces fixed in a permanent scowl, the remaster instead swaps it out for faces that while more realistic, have no stylistic appeal to them and feature dead expressions devoid of personality.

The UI in the original was particularly fantastic, and had a certain order to it: The static bar at the bottom of the screen that was always present and could not be moved was made out of marble, and 'set in stone' so to speak. Any menus or UI elements that you could open or close at will were represented by scrolls. This created a distinction between the static and dynamic aspects of the UI that was incredibly intuitive.

The new UI simply has everything be in marble. The devs understood that they had to make it roman-themed, but haven't replicated the thought and care put behind the original UI. To make things worse, much more information is packed into far smaller areas, and many things that were conveyed by easy to read text in the original are now hidden as tightly packed icons that all seem to blur together.

In a desire to retrofit a tech-tree like feel, the settlement building menu no longer shows you the straight upgrade paths for each building, rather intertwining them confusingly and giving each building a generic icon rather than a more detailed image of the actual building itself, making it far more difficult at a glance to tell what is what.

Agents in particular have had a confusing overhaul. Where before you simply right-clicked to have them go on a mission like any other unit does, now sometimes you must open a separate menu and select a target from there, increasing the amount of clicks to do just one task.

Each individual issue adds up to a frustrating experience, and at $40 CAD the game is honestly not worth the price of admission. The original Rome: Total War could be had for as low as a dollar on sale in the past - and now you can't even buy that version alone, as it's now gated behind a thirty to fourty dollar remaster that looks and plays far worse.

Not recommended whatsoever. Finding the original physical release of Rome: Total War Gold and Alexander is much preferable to this, though they require a few tweaks to run well on modern versions of Windows. The physical editions are also redeemable on steam with the verification code in the manual - though it's a gamble whether or not a used copy has been redeemed already.",1646120882,1646121289,False,117,6,0.854238688945770264,0,True,False,False

I played the vanilla game with the Julii faction with VH/M difficulty with modded battle length and blood mod. I blitz to the north of my starting position with ease. Then, I expanded to Massilia then to Narbo Martius to capitalized on the mines there. Then I took Sardinia and then to the biggest city Carthage. Just a precautionary measure, I placed forts at all choke points from Patavium to Narbo Martius to delay barbarian advance. I placed towers to extend my sight too the hostile areas.

Problems begun when both Gauls and Spain allied and they attacked non-stop with 6 full stacks on their greatest attack at Narbo Martius and Massilia while one third of my armies are in Carthage. I nearly lost both towns. I had to left from Carthage to help the Southern Gaul. Money is tight because of recruitment and retraining of losses and I have to budget for the more important expenses.

This is the type of campaign that I enjoy much, coupled with the massive battles with longer battle length. I am playing offline so you won't see my total hours played.

Still, I often find myself going back to the game, because the battles really are quite fun and feel much more real and fluid than what we'd get in the later games.

It is an alright remaster, it could be better, however it is much better than anything they have released since Shogun II (a sad reality of the situation with CA)

Flanking hammer and anvils are very effective (unlike post shogun II total war)
The physics works better than anything on the current engine (I am pretty sure physical height still gives a distance advantage to skirmishers as it did in the original)

I've played countless hours of the original total war game and was hyped when I purchased this game. After hours of gameplay I quickly began to notice how dumb the AI is. After being besieged by the huns I employed a tactic to beat them, for every turn the siege lasted I pressed the attack on them. On the battlefield map my archers could shoot their horsemen from the walls and in return the AI just stood still and let themselves die. When enemy reinforcements arrived the AI placed units underneath the walls' tower. From then on it was just rinse and repeat, by the time the AI actually attacked me they had nothing. If I'm playing on medium-hard mode I expect a challenge with an AI that can adapt to it's situation, not this.

Let's not talk about the pathfinding either. 

Additionally and more importantly the game's got serious crashing issues. Later in the same playthrough as I became more established the game suddenly began to crash whenever it was a specific AI's turn. I loaded an earlier save and played the game through to see if I could do anything different and sadly, the game still crashed at that specific turn with the same faction. I tried to do some troubleshooting and look up solutions on their official forums' and other places but yielded zero results.

I don't care about the UX/UI that people mention, it can probably be changed by mods. What I do care about however is the overall quality of the game, no AI is perfect I'm sure the original RTW had issues. This isn't 2004 - the AI shouldn't be this horrendous. Furthermore having to go through loops to find out why your game is crashing takes away from the overall experience, the worst of it is that it's not even fixed. I'd rather not invest time into a campaign if I can't complete it. 

So no, I don't recommend this game. Maybe they'll fix these issues and maybe I'll give this game a thumbs up when they do.",1642964053,1642964053,False,38,4,0.768582999706268311,0,True,False,False

I loved the original Rome Total War. It's in my top 3 games of all time. I really wanted to play this, I really did! I bought it at launch, installed and got it running. Great, but then ... intermittent keyboard dropout, mouse won't work after a few mins, game locks up and needs alt-f4 to end it. I wasn't going to be able to play it much anyway as life was busy at that time, so I thought ok I'll let them patch it and come back later.

Almost a year later I thought I would give it another try... Downloaded it... ""Corruption Detected""... Verifying... ""Missing Downloaded Files""... Verifying.... ""Missing Downloaded Files"".... Verifying.... over and over again. For the life of me I can't get this game to install anymore! I've redownloaded it a dozen times (thank god I have fast internet or it would have been even worse). I've checked the game folder and there's no files in it, except a couple empty folders. I looked in the steam download folder and there's the files, just sitting there. I've tried manually moving them over but nope... Verifying failures.. I've tried numerous possible fixes, workarounds and deleting caches. No other game does this to me on steam, only this one.

I contacted steam for a refund and ok it's past 14 days but they do say in unique circumstances they could provide a refund. I was given a simple NO.

Shame on you CA, Feral and Steam! I have bought every total war game to ever come out (except shogun 1 original) and almost all dlc for them. This is also the first game I've ever asked to return as it's completely unfit for purpose!

I'm allowing comments if anyone has suggestions about how I could get the bleeding thing to download and install I would gladly accept. It's not like I can get my money back now.. I'm running latest windows 10, rtx 2080, 16gb ram and R5 3600. Fairly fresh install of windows and steam. So it should work but nope.",1642801354,1642801354,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b] BUY THIS GAME! [/b]

Long review:
As a relative newcomer to the Total War series, the first game I have tried (excluding Napoleon which overwhelmed me with its initial complexity, one of the common problems for completely new players in the TW series) was the original Total War: Rome followed by the so called crowned king of all TWs: Medieval II. For some reason, the pure simplicity of the older Total Wars was quite attractive to me along with the entertaining tactical gameplay. However, although I did not mind it as much in Med II, I could not withstand the apparently off-putting graphics of the original Rome in 2020.

This remaster solved all the little details I was complaining about in the original version.
-Decent graphical update with vast variety of up-scaled units that include the ethnicity of soldiers based on the region they were recruited from.
-More advanced battle options (love the ""move whole army in formation"" mechanics while holding ALT key).
-Included both expansions and the base game.
-Added mechanics from newer games such as the merchants.
-Minor issues were also fixed with recent patches. 
-Nonetheless, be aware of the not so flashed out unit pathfinding.

If I were you, I would buy this game for 2 simple reasons.

1) I see the biggest potential of this game in the modding scene. Last patch added nearly limitless possibilities never seen in any other TW game and I would love to mention some of the currently available mods.
 [b] Total War Chivalry [/b] is an amazing mod ported from the Original RTW, thanks to Gudea, the historian, teacher and author of the mod, it surpasses its original version in terms of historical accuracy, gameplay mechanics, unit diversity and there is still way more to come (for example the completely new Crusade Campaign). 
The other famous mod is [b] Imperium Surrectum [/b] which rebalances the base game, improves AI, merges all Roman families into one, reworks and adds units and factions. 
Definitely give them a go!

2) If there is a chance we will ever get remaster for TW Medieval 2 (which is, for me, the best game in the series). We should support the decent work they did with Rome: Remastered.

What they did good?
They improved the performance and the controls in comparison to the original, which is the biggest upgrade. The original isn't that well polished for newer pcs and on my machine, it never works with over 30 FPS. The Remaster has a very good performance with much more FPS, literally no lags and no crashes.
Also, the new TotalWar-Controls are a pure joy, in the original you had to manually map every key if you wanted to change the old controls, which were very clunky and much based on mouse-control, while I personally prefer using my keyboard more.

What they did wrong?
They seriously missed to add some new features to the game which the original needed to be perfect. There are still no multiplayer campaign and still no Realtime-Naval-Battles. Diplomacy still is very ridiculous and the pathfinding is still a nightmare if you aren't used to its... ""special touch"".
Also, they mixed the faction strength up in the wrong way. Egypt is still op af, while the roman factions are far too weak (in a short campaign (40-50 turns), the julii struggle to get patavium and mediolanum).

So if you played the Original a lot and had fun with it, you will surely enjoy this game, but I would recommend to wait for a sale because 30 Bucks are far too much.
If you're a new player, you should evaluate if you can enjoy a game that clearly was made many years ago. If you only enjoyed the newer Total Wars (Warhammer, Shogun2, ...), it is definitely possible that you won't like Rome Remastered, so think twice before you buy.

They turned a classic into a wack a mole, the AI spawns countless armies just out of your fog of war to hit your weakest settlements as you go back and forth wacking moles. BORING. The Old game was not like this.

The UI IS AWFUL. I don't know what the hell went through their minds thinking it was okay to ruin the classic UI. The new one is small with small buttons that are hard to see or even know what they mean like the recruit tab is a blank flag? I dont think recruitment when i look at a blank flag and the default view when you click on settlements is always the repair tab? like LOL? is this a joke? so you have to go through the settlement menu every. single. time. you click. on a settlement. to get to the building tab. and that is extremely frustrating. if you can't tell by my excessive use of periods.

Naturally I updated my drivers, tried everything with game settings, process settings (running it on a single core did not help) and graphic card settings. I tried even the most obscure tips I found in the net. I reinstalled the game several times. Nothing worked. 

I could invest more time into this but I am not willing to. When I pay 30 Eu for a game I expect it to be playable.

I played a little of MTW way back (before I had any concept of system requirements and fought with little block men) but I didn't really get into Total War until Shogun 2; (which is still my favorite TW title to date)

This title brings in aspects of total war that one may find a tad bit annoying and/or archaic. One blast from the past is having to actually retrain your units to replenish them, no auto replenish just because you're in your home turf. I like that it seems like this prevents the AI from doing the 2 or 3 full stack rush they do in later titles, but maybe that's just me. It means that loss of life in battle hits a little harder. The battles are much different, there is not as much of a front line meat grinder aspect and very much depends more you being able to flank and out maneuver more-so than more recent titles. 

The OG graphics are a bit dated, however the soundtrack is easily one of the best of the series. I can understand that, for people who played the snot out of the original, this remaster may seem underwhelming. I've heard the original had alot of mods made for it, here's hoping that there can be a similar case here.

Original Rome, is my go to game, ive played it every year since it came out. Its perfect, even its flaws. 

The UI here is clearly ipad devoted, took some time to figure it out. Its not bad for the changes but it takes some time to get attuned to it> This ui change and layout just is not necessary. 

Why the negative? Bugs. Unforgivable ones. 

Reinforcements dont work to any logic in some specific battle situations. Quite literally infuriatingly so. 

Crashes. I have thousands of hours in original rome and it never crashed. Rome remastered, 4 times in a few hours. You can tell what ever they`ve put into the remastered is taking its toll on the game engine. 

Not gonna touch the mod support or fact most great mods will never be ported here, its a pointless pro or con, this game should be judged on its base mechanics, not what others add. 

HOWEVER, replayablity is solely in the original Rome, not this. I like that they made a shiny new Rome, but the IPAD UI and feel. ruins it for me.  

Saying that, there are some improvements on old Rome. Attacking cities now actually punishes the attacker, old Rome, you lost a dozen or so forces to wall defences more if you played really bad. Here, you will lose a good portion to defences before and while facing defenders, which is so much nicer. 

Game also clearly has a logic improvement for AI, which is very nice. 

So im 60/40 against the remastered sadly. The bugs ive encountered and the UI are just too annoying right now. 

I have no doubt the modding community will sort out a vanilla style UI, which would probably make me reconsider and give this a positive review *with mods. Would be nice if the devs gave us the option.",1640583890,1640583890,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Since then many total wars have been released, but the ones I really liked except Rome 1 were Medieval 2 and Shogun. When Rome Remastered was announced I was very exited, but then all these negative reviews came up and I wasn't sure whether I want to spend the 30euros for something that will not deliver. I saw the videos in youtube and I also didn't liked the new UI. However I purchased the game and after 10 hours I think:

1. The original gameplay is still there and that's the main reason I purchased the game
2. The graphics are improved and with few settings tweaks it looks excellent
3. The UI is bad. The devs have tried to implement too many ideas that at the end are all messed up, but I started using the shortcuts and it FIXES the bad UI. The shortcuts are saving so many clicks that it actually is game changer. I strongly suggest to anyone who does't like to UI to lean the shortcuts and try them out.
4. It runs well on M1 Air Monterey 12.1. I currently have one mod called ""Family trees enhanced"". So far 0 crashes. The game looks well and it doesn't lag.

There are a lot of MODs already that will further improve the gameplay. I see many people expense crashes on MAC. I plan to test how the game will behave on M1 Air with few mods installed. I hope the mods will not crash the game. So far I enjoy the vanilla and I will dedicate few hundred of hours playing it. BTW I also have Rome 2 and its a BIG disappointment to me.

If you are a true Total War fan and would like to have Total War: Rome REMASTERED in your library, you can buy it and play it. However, this game is a Remaster, not an entirely Remake. By knowing this, buy and play the game. Otherwise, you will be grievously disappointed.

Although there are new elements and improvements, naturally, there are mostly improvements without going beyond graphic enhancement. However, I prefer the AI ​​of Rome: Total War to the AI ​​of Total War: Rome REMASTERED. In the REMASTERED version, both the campaign map and battle AI are disgraceful; at least that's how I experienced it. Units change formations just randomly. Sometimes they are acting like I'm not giving the order them to do something. The only bad thing about the REMASTERED version is the AI, and it is bad, really bad. I mean it!

However, the game has its advantages, too. Total War: Rome REMASTERED appears to be a completely new game that was not released as an improvement over the original Rome: Total War. This is the point that makes me worried. So, it also means they're changing artificial intelligence. If only they hadn't... From the graphics improvements to the game's REMASTERED version, there are more user-friendly elements in the game, also new contents that we haven't seen in the original Rome: Total War. The game supports ultra HD resolution. There's also amazing updated 3D unit models and textures, widescreen and ultra-wide monitor support. Not to mention the new agent Merchant, of course. The atmosphere of war, campaign map and visual effects are also included in the graphic development. The new pieces of information and lines on the faction, trade, summary, etc. screen and unit information screens on the campaign map of the game have also been improved. In addition, improved camera and control settings have been added to the game. In addition to these, there are also quick access lists to facilitate access.

Overall, it is a good game to experience Rome: Total War with good graphics and atmosphere, but as I said before; ""...don't buy or play this game if you want to feel nostalgic.

Pros:
I was almost excited this game might have been worth another play through!
Feral Interactive finally realizes that mods in the steam workshop are far superior.

Cons:
Played as Carthage this time. Achievement for short campaign missing, long campaign is fine. It seems other players on the forums are complaining about achievements not unlocking.
Buy Medieval 2 Total War before Feral remasters that game and has the original removed form the steam store. 

Games still suffers from Pax Europa Syndrome. I don't know why, but nearly every faction, with some exceptions, will happily wait until your armies arrive to commit genocide. Even the factions that do attack, Romans for example, aren't very good at it. In the original game, every faction would mobilize into a state of ""total war."" 


Other thoughts:
Thankfully, I own the original Rome Total War on steam. The rest of you should sign a petition for it to be available again. I can even go back to the disc version I bought 15 years ago.

*********************************


I've been playing the original Rome total war since buying the game on disc. I've played it on Steam for hundreds of hours as well. Might be my favorite game of all time.

Pros:
better camera.
WASD keys.
better world map.
Steam Achievements.
Takes twice the memory allocation before crashing.
Some minor game play improvements that you might not notice.
Graphical upgrade for better resolutions

Cons:
Enemy AI is brain dead. Seriously, this game is even easier than before.
All new game crashing bugs.
New portraits for units.
Except for the Romans, enemy factions build large armies, but never go on the offensive. Whatever cities they occupy at the beginning of the game, won't change until you invade them.
New user interface is an absolute abomination. Look for a mod that converts it back to the old one.
Diplomacy is train wreck.
The game's original charm is gone.
 
In conclusion, it feels like the remaster was given to a developer that never played this game before. Had they asked for fans of the original for input, there were a lot of basic improvements that could have been implemented. 

Here are just a few:
Automated building queues for cities. Automating taxes are fine, but when you chose to automate everything, the game assumes you want to build large armies in every city you own. The automated recruitment queue needs to go.

More cities on the world map would be great.

Global policy setting - For example, prioritize roads for all settlements. 

Training Generals, like in Barbarian Invasion, should be brought to the original game.

*Total War Rome Remastered includes the base game, the Alexander expansion, and the Barbarian Invasion expansion. Once you install the game and hit play, you launch each game individually through the launcher. Hopefully that helps clear up any confusion!*


As someone who grew up on the original Rome 1, playing the Remastered version causes a ton of nostalgia and brings back pleasant memories. But nostalgia alone doesn't create a good game/remaster. But in my view, the game delivers on what it sets out to do. The Remastering is faithful to the original while enhancing the graphics ui/ visibility of important game elements. This remaster gives you the option to choose between the new, remastered settings, or to play the original game with unmodified settings. I recommend the remastered settings, but do whatever you'll have the most fun with. Battles are a bit too quick for my taste, but that's personal preference and isn't a major complaint, there are ways to increase it.

The enhanced graphics are probably the most significant and noticeable improvement, and they look quite good. There's something quite pleasant about playing a old game that's new again through a remastering. You get fun and enjoyable mechanics that make sense, but with a more streamlined experience overall.

One of my favorite aspects of the game is the population system. If you only play the newer total wars, this will probably be a foreign concept to you. But yeah, population actually is a sort of resource here. Each of your cities will have a population number, with various ways that it can be decreased or increased. Recruiting soldiers will take from a city's population to recruit them. Tax levels influence the growth rate (or decline) of a city's population. A certain population number is needed to upgrade your cities to their next level, and hence to unlock further buildings. Modern total wars are sorely lacking these type of mechanics, and it's unfortunate. Features like these give the campaign a greater degree of depth.

My biggest gripe or complaints with the game would be the pathfinding of units (sometimes units will get lost in settlements or have trouble navigating them.) They have improved this, but sometimes there's no avoiding it. Another issue is that the game crashes every once in awhile. Again, they have improved this but it still happens at times.

 With any total war game, mods bring more longevity to the game, and RR is no different.With the latest update to the game modding capabilities have been enhanced considerably. There are already a few good mods worth playing now, with many more that I've heard of being in the works. (Including a Lord of the Rings mod). Expect many many more mods in the future worth checking out.

The verdict? Total War Rome Remastered is worth your time. If you like some of the concepts I talked about that the game includes, you will probably enjoy it. Or if you were a fan of the original Rome 1, this is just a more streamlined and better looking version of that with steam modding support. I will be playing a lot more of this game in the future, and I strongly feel that now is the time to get involved playing the game, considering the modding support and latest update.",1640046463,1640046463,True,125,1,0.897997438907623291,5,True,False,False

Does the game hit the old school total war vibe? Yes. Does it fill you with nostalgia? Yes. Is it fun to play? Absolutely, but with very frustrating moments. 

For one, in-battle pathing is god awful--especially with sieges. Since release day, I have NO idea why this has not been fixed. For example, let's say an enemy unit sallies out and you route them. INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO CHASE THEM IN A STRAIGHT LINE THE GAME PATHS YOU TO LOOP AROUND THE CITY CENTER AND BACK. WHY???

Second, the game is not optimized properly. I've ran on high-end Windows OS and MacOS systems and have experienced the motherload of loads on both. Why is this game such a CPU & GPU whore? Why am I able to use my laptop as a stove top while I'm running this game? It's a remastered ffs! 

By the way, do not try to play this on the new Macbook Pros (M1 chip), battles will crash your GPU and force you to hard reboot no matter what settings you play on. Until this is patched, the game is unplayable. Because of these frustrating moments, I, unfortunately, have to give this game a thumbs down. In the meantime, I'll go back to beet farming and playing Battlestar Galactica.

I would consider changes made by Feral either positive, or neutral. I think that the new UI makes it easier to navigate the empire, as it grows, but I'm not a fan of it's visual design. Same goes for battle UI. It's helfpul (unit morale, ammo, health), but I just think it looks kind of ugly. The reason I'm not recommending it, is due to completely broken unit path finding in narrow streets and on bridges. It's definitely worse than in original Rome, as I put another 50 hours, or so into it a few months ago, so my memory is quite fresh. Tactical movement through bridges and narrow city streets in the Remaster is pretty much impossible, as the units completely break formation while moving through them and start running in wide circles for a while after leaving them, to reform, so you can't order them to pour out of the street and form a line, when the enemy is near. As both sieges and bridge battles are happening very often, the game is simply not enjoyable in this state.
Edit: Feral has improved the game a lot with recent patches. You still can't move the units through bridges in formation, as the game considers it the same as swimming through water, but otherwise the units tend to keep their formations, even on extreme unit scale. The UI looks quite nice in the current version as well. Overall very good job done by Feral.",1621363033,1639763461,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I was expecting the same gaming experience as on the original release. The first impression was a minor letdown since there were some issues how the game worked compared to the original. For example cursor going to the other monitor despite all the correct settings set. The gameplay itself brought new features like merchants and ability to play all the factions (excluding S.P.Q.R. and Rebels). Refinement of the textures and models are superb. Which makes the game look on par with older Total War releases with fine textures. The ability to choose settings between original game behaviour and the latter releases is an excellent addition. Now those who haven't experienced the original release but have previous gameplay experience on newer Total War releases can easily conform to this game.

So far there hasn't been any bugs to mention. On the downside one feature that I would criticize is the minimap. It is far too small to see anything. I would need to put my face next to the screen to distinguish which faction owns which regions.

Overall well remastered game. The best I've tried so far.

In its current state, however, I do not enjoy the game. The UI and graphics are a massive letdown in my eyes and I haven't even played half an hour so far.

Having to alternate tabs to either see your army or your buildings in a settlement bogs my brain. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the tabs (on hotkeys 1 and 2) while no settlement is selected. But while having a settlement selected it's annoying as hell having to switch back and forth.

Icons for the buildings you can construct are for ants, even at 120% scaling. Same goes for units you can recruit. Very annoying, especially since the main tab at the bottom gets very big at 120% scaling. Half of it is just background though and you don't get any value in terms of gameplay or QOL from it.

While this is down to personal preference, I do not like the general ""comic""-style. The map is, to me, too colorful, even at 0% vibrancy. 

For now I can't comment on battles but I have seen comments saying cavalry charges have much lesser impact and archers (or skirmishers in general) have bigger issues disengaging than in the OG Rome. 

Right now I am not happy or satisfyed with the game, but I do believe the issues it has are fixable. Watch out for future patches.


Update 11th of December 2021: 

The last major update this game will receive did not fix my issues with the game. The UI is still a mess, the game is still too vibrant amongst other things and without the 50% discount for owners of the original (now unavailable) Rome: Total War, it is simply overpriced.

You have a panic attack while around your friends. You assume they they will brutally backstab and murder you over the slightest amount of weakness you show, at any moment.

While looking at past historical ruins you picture them in x-ray mode, noting where the critical ""Industry & Recruitment"" locations are.

While looking at open fields in real life, you picture dozens of dreaded sprinting horse-archers in front of them, lamenting how much you should have kept yourself garrisoned instead of trecking out to meet them.

You get frustrated with your repairman when he can't fix your house in under one minute.

You can hold your eyes closed  for only five seconds before you must open them.

You suddenly can pronounce 300bc-600ads Latin and Greek Dialects and have a personal scribe.

While watching the news you see documentaries of outnumbered fights vs overwhelming odds, people rescuing the day by sheer might of will. ""No big deal, just find a bridge"" you think.

You get nervous when you hear Germanic languages spoken aloud.

You know more about effective 300 BC era tactics and combat than some actual Roman infantrymen officers at the time did, and you have never even been to Italy.

When you see two kids' kites get tied up together; you mutter to yourself, ""damn archer team killers...""

You freak out every time someone uses modern nation state names than the historical era names.

You constantly beg your optometrist for ""Total War General Vision,"" even though your vision is 20/20.

You don't have to use an alarm clock anymore. You sit bolt upright after nightmares of ""THIS IS A TERRIBLE DEFEAT, YOUR MEN FLEE THE BATTLEFIELD, COMMANDER!""

You drive a car that has two archer riders. Inside, a set of portable earthen cookware instead of a spare tire, and a pouch of salt with a shovel on the side.

When the car dealership asks what color you want, you insist on Royal Red paint.

When a cop pulls you over and asks why your engine has been replaced with a donkey, you tell him ""Full Immersion.""

You get fired from your delivery job and CIA agents following you when it's found out you've been recruiting the homeless and rebels into a personal army.

You have CIA agent stalkers to prevent you from recreating the Roman Empire. Only after you've secured one more battle in RTWR will you start your revolution. Just one more battle....",1619710420,1639111292,True,6,1,0.598753094673156738,4,True,False,False

Now Rome Remastered on the other hand took an old game and remastered it to bring it up to modern standands of current total war.

The Pros:
Updated Graphics
Modernized Mechanics
All Factions Unlocked
Factions Match there culture

The Cons
Updated U.I Feels like it was made for mobile in mind
A,I is archiac at times and it shows during siege battles
After multiple turns the game can slow down(You need to restart it)
There is CTD but rare on my machine

Heres a playthrough i did on Youtube which will give you an idea!

I think the developers have done a decent job and if you loved the original, you will likely love the REMASTERED.

Things to consider:

1. There have been some UI improvements/QoL changes from the original. It's probably worth going through the initial tutorial to learn it. I was initially on the fence about these small changes, but, I do think overall; they are better. Once you get used to them.

2. The camera movement/navigation key bindings by default in REMASTERED are different to original. But, you can toggle it to the original ones in the settings menu. I nearly stopped playing until I found that option as I found the camera movements unintuitive to how I play.

3. The AI in battles is certainly not as bad (or has been fixed to some degree) since some of the other reviews. However, there are still a few times the AI has issues, but they tend to be occasional, and not too frequent and certainly nothing I didn't experience in the original. i.e sieging enemy troops not entering the city if spies open the gates and they only have battering rams. Or, units getting stuck ""cheering"" after defeating a unit, but the battle is still going on.",1638873037,1638873037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played Rome 2 and it would've been nice to see some of the systems that made micromanaging easier but other than that I do like the battles more than Rome 2 it makes more sense and it feels more impactful. One big problem and I don't know why creative assembly has not fixed it yet is the bug when you get reinforcements into the battle they kinda just hang outside the map.

Pros: 
- The graphical updates look really good.
- Some good features from other games have been added, Merchants from Medieval 2 for example.
- The battles have been made to play more like the newer games, better camera and UI.

Cons: 
- The campaign UI is somewhat unintuitive and very cluttered. I've played a lot of TW and IMO this is one of the worst in this regard.
- Minor nitpick, but I'm not sure why they took out the really cool menu loop and loading screens. They've been replaced with in game screenshots and, at best, serviceable art.
- They give you access to all of the factions off the bat, you no longer need to earn them like you did in previous games. Which makes playing as them feel cheap but maybe that's just me, I really liked earning them in Rome 1 and Medieval 2.
- Seems like they expected the modding community to fix some a lot of the BUGS and GLITCHS cause there are a lot and it would appear that their dropping support for the game soon.

I feel like this was a wasted opportunity, they had the frame work to produce an excellent remake. The issue with this one is that its simply not better than the original, so the price tag is hard to justify in my mind.

If you are just interested in a bit of visual stimulus and  to easily single click your way through the game, like an Idle/mobile title, then look elsewhere.

The strategic and tactical layer of this game is what sells it for most people and now modders are able to increase those levels to even higher levels.

I will edit this review once i've played some more but this is just a general opinion for any new buyers of Total War game or the stubburn vetrans of the passed many Total Wars. I have tried the game without the graphic enhancing addon yet as i wanted to get right in and try it. The game looks refreshing and new but still plays and feels the same. The campaign map at the moment looks a bit cartoony but i guess that will improve once i have downloaded the extra graphics addon. I played a small custom battle and completed one turn on the campaign. This really feels like the old game, the way the units move and fight and even the music is the same which also feels enhanced. The campaign feels like it may take some time to get use to, control and managment wise but looks a lot more user friendly. For a first try the game played great, no long loading times or crashes so far. But yea, at the moment the game feels nice and new and i'm looking forward to putting many hours into it and also look forward to potential mods and extras.

Let me be direct, this game is not perfect (I wish i got paid for everytime I'm forced to say that) BUTT most of those problems can be fixed by future patches. I like the fact you have an option to select which elements you want to have remastered (such as merchant, better campain ai etc) but i wish we had more options, again I am almost sure this will get addresed in future patches.

The artstyle is a mixed bag for me, I love the remastered textures, you can feel the soul of the original game by just looking at them, i like the units variation (no more clone armies - but if you liked the clones you can always turn that option on). I have read some opinions about game looking terrible, ugly and all the bad things from pandora's box. I can even understand some of those complains but again let's be honest, if you are expecting 8K textures, then this is not the game for you. So what's so bad about the artstyle when all i have said is positive. Well... the loading screens, for me they just look like a civilisation VI rip-off, i miss the old, gloomy ones from the original game. They were simple, that's for sure but they looked fenomenal. Maybe if they got rid of the cartoony characters i wouldn't complain so much (and yes i know that rome was always a bit on the cartoony side, I'm absolutely fine with that, it's one of the reason i love this game so much, yes im talking about pyjama boys).

The UI, and Jeeeessus the UI, for me this is the biggest problem that the game is facing right now. First few hours were a constant struggle with that fakker. Developers in their pursuit of trying to make things minimalistic and slick made some options a bit hard to find, take for example how units are behaving in a battle, by default units will run at all time or the formation of grouped units will not be saved if you want to move them to some new position, to change that you need to click on the arrow thingy on the right side of the screen or press space and then change that in the additional pannel that will show up. Like it's not that big of the deal once you know where to find it, but yeah, i didn't and found it only because of some good soul which told me what to do. And don't get me even started on the small as fu ck constraction and unit training tab, this NEEDS to be fixed.

Oh yeah and the bugs, for now i did not have a single crash to the desktop. Battles are also not a problem, the campain map however, can sometimes get extremely laggy, but after saving the game and loading it back problem disappears (some memory leak?). 

I could go on and on but it's just a stupied steam review that noone is going to read anyway, but i will say this. If you are a fan of the original game then go ahead and buy it, you are going to like it. If you are new to the first Rome, then you can always refund it.",1619912277,1638180812,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You start off with a small territory and you manage your resources to grow and upgrade your towns and armies and expand your territory by invading and conquering other towns and cities. If you've played Civilization then you'll be familiar with the game play. The difference is in the battles where the overhead map view is transformed into a close up view of the battlefield where you can move the camera around the battlefield and position your soldiers where you think is best before the battle starts. Once it starts you give your various units orders to move them around and attack ememy units. It's very immersive  once you're in a battle controlling your troops and trying to turn the tide of battle in your favour. The different units have different strengths and weaknesses which should inform your tactics. Took me a few hours to get into this game but then I got that one more turn feeling and I was hooked.  The graphics are a little dated but I still became immersed in the game and felt like I was controlling an empire. The game is running fine on my Core i5 3570s and gtx 1050 2mb graphics card although the loading times when a battle starts can be a couple of minutes.

We history fans were begining to wonder if you forgot about those of us who helped you grow into the company you are today. Never forget where you come from and the fans and people who got you there. This is a start to make up for ignoring us history peps for the last decade as you fawned all over fantasy tropes and warhammer. Alas, I digress, Rome Total Realism and Roma Surrectum mod teams have joined forces and that alone was enough to get me to buy this remaster. I have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised at the quality and care Feral games gave this remaster, especially hearing how they reached out to the modding community and have bent over backwards to open this gem up for the modding community. 

Hats off Feral. You just might have pulled off the impossible here. Remaster a beloved classic, and actually make it better, with subtle, but very valuable and much needed information. 

The things they have changed actually provide us with MORE information. The organization of agents, armies and cities is done really well. I was a bit worried at first, changes to classics usually are not a good thing, but honestly, there are not a lot of changes, what is changed is graphical, bringing the UI to the 2020s and I found a nice refreshing addtion to the series. 

Well here's to Creative Assembly, Feral interactive, the Rome Total realism and Roma Surrectum teams, I cannot wait to dive into that full on RTR - Imperium Surrectum mod!

This is not right for a game that should have been checked for bugs and crashes. The game also got stuck at certain point, and honestly I had to restart the game to unstuck it. 

Overall, I love this game it is great, but with the current bugs I can't suggest anyone to buy the game for the full price. The graphics is alright, but I've definitely noticed that troops movement is a bit janked up which essentially means, if you click your troops to a specific location. The troop will run around like a fool, or in circles in confusion. I wish this could be fixed as the original rome total war did not have this movement issue at all. 

The difficulty of this game has still remained to be very mediocre, I wish that the ""very hard"" difficult had better AI's in the performance of combat as well as the campaign maps as there are frequent times where the AI would not attack a base that is very weak, but instead run around like an idiot.

Update: The recent updates have definitely cleaned the game up very nicely, but I still do not think that it is really worth the price at which you are buying a whole new game simply for better graphics. The mechanics are better than release but is still merky.

Update; after playing for some time now, I can say that the game has really been polished however just as it released it was that easily abandoned. Making content wise not that fun.

[i] Remastered [/i] version contains the original game, plus the [i] Barbarian Invasion [/i] and [i] Alexander [/i] expansion packs. The main draw of this edition, aside from making the game playable and stable on modern OS's without the need for hacks or fan patches, is a massive graphical update covering every part of the game that, while not bringing the game quite up to 2021 standards, does make it look significantly nicer than the 2004 original. In addition, the developers have made several other improvements and upgrades to the game. These include fixing various old bugs, exploits, and balance issues, making the campaign and battle AI somewhat more intelligent and less irrational, overhauling the UI, and making the unplayable factions from the original game and the [i] Barbarian Invasion [/i] expansion fully playable. Finally, the [i] Remastered [/i] version integrates Steam multiplayer and mod downloads into the game, allowing players to access these features with less of a hassle than they would experience if still playing the original game.

That said, the [i] Remastered [/i] version does have a few minor issues of its own. For one thing, it doesn't actually add anything new in the form of factions, campaigns or units, except for adding a new agent to the campaign game, although most people weren't really expecting anything on that scale to begin with. Also, the overhauled UI can be kind of counter-intuitive and hard to read at times, and some issues from the original game, such as pathfinding bugs, still remain.

The games are little buggy. Performance wise I had problems with lag spikes when playing longer turns. I wasnt really sure what caused it since sometimes it would go away and only happened on some parts of the map. Also I would have loved that the turns would be faster, like they are in Medival 2 Total War. I am pretty sure they use the same engine and that game turns are really fast compared to the original game and even to this.

All of the factions are playable, and are unlocked by defeating them in-game, which is something that fans of the game have wanted since 2004. The different map modes are extremely useful, especially for the campaign map. The merchant is a nice addition, and adds a small layer of strategy to the finances of the game. The terrain and units are brighter and more colorful, with more detailed variation depending on faction. The game also runs very smoothly so far.

I was hesitant to buy this as i'm not a big fan of remastered games in general but I did it and I do NOT regret it!

REALLY fun game, The graphics are decent and kinda cartoony but it works really well. Compared with Rome 2 the combat is faster and units seem to move a bit faster and don't hold formation as well but i actually quite like it.

Its not as 'realistic' as rome 2 and is a bit more cartoony but a great game i don't regret buying it at all. Battle feels smooth. I havn't done a single 'auto resolve' yet as the act of going into battle feels alot more lightweight and as such makes it less of a chore.

That is combined with CA's or whoever the fucks money grubbing scheme of bundling the original RTW with this remaster and not allowing steam users to buy the currently superior product (original RTW) seperately, when previously original RTW was sold seperately. Now the gem of RTW is hidden behind this arbitrary paywall which shouldn't exist, it only exists because whoever is in charge is scared their product sucks so lets make the better game which has been out for 15 years into this weird exclusive product after all this time. Its almost like the industry is afraid of these old games exposing how lazy and uninspired many games are today. ""But consoomer, you're supposed to buy Warhammer 3!!!"" I swear, if they do this bundle shit to Medieval 2 with some kind of half assed remaster to jerk us around with... im going to burst a blood vessel like Valentinian the Wrathful.

The original game has dated graphics, yes, but it is a far more finished product than this half assed remaster. All they had to do was polish the up the graphics, the campaign map, and the UI just a little bit, and this would be a very worthwhile product. This is the worst UI I've ever seen in a modern strategy game and it seems zero thought was put into making things intuitive like the original game's UI was. What the fuck is this cursed mailbox in the corner of the screen with your number of notifications? What is this, twitter? Who asked for this? That's only one example. Recruiting and building are also polluted by this design filth. Campaign UI is not supposed to be a maze which one spends more time figuring out than fighting the battles themselves. Its supposed to let us make the campaign decisions and move on to battles, not to give us cancer of the eyes before we fight even our first battle.

Even superficial minds who just like the graphics will recoil from the abomination of the UI. I will probably stick around and wait to see what modders will make on the workshop, but that doesn't mean you should bite the bullet too.

I'd really prefer the classic UI in almost every single way. The new one is poorly thought out to the point that it almost exclusively detracts from play. It LOOKS nice, but it FEELS awful. I pray the mod community can fix this if the devs won't, but they really should.

EVEN WORSE than the UI though, is the notification system. It saps all the life out of the game and all the family updates and everything go missed. The notifications about idle fleets are also quite tiring.

Overall: Do not buy because of the notification system ""upgrade"" alone. There's no soul to the game or your characters. Events just fly by in a boring blur and everything is missed. Whoever remastered this never played the game, I think.",1620015589,1635734958,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some of the unit retextures look nice, but the terrain and architecture is still very Uncanny Valley.
Oh... and Alexander is still a barely-playable mess!

Rome Total war, Barbarian invasion, Alexander plus easy access to mods through the steam workshop which is very nice.
Pros - Better graphics not mind blowing but improved for sure 
- More factions to play like Macedon and Thrace also spain plus a few more not available in base game 
-The diplomacy I have found to be generally better than original Rome I have formed bonds easier and I like the addition of reputation overall just a nicer exsperiance and more worthwhile to engage in.
-If you want to play the Original through this game you can all the original settings very easy to do in game.
-if you own The original Rome total war gold addition this does not replace that in your steam libary so if just want to play the original game in all its glory you still can which is great. 
- no DLC you get the complete game 3 major campaigns in one the Rome, Barbarian invasion and alexander 
- what i played Runs absolutely perfectly no crashes or bugs many have seemed to be patched out from earlier reviews so thats good the developer is constantly working on the game and patching any issues.
- I tried the game on A GTX 1650 graphics card runs flawlessly 60 fps 1080p easy no slowdown no issues at all.

Cons 
- Merchants the great debate continues but really they are useless for me as by the time I have them im earning like 50000 plus a turn anyway Another thing in this Game Money is more easily come by Trade routes are more rich and cities seem to earn more money generally I have found its crazy you never feel like your lacking resources once you get over the initial startup phase. 
- the campaign map can seem a little more muddled than the original i cant exsplain just everything seems a little blended together.
-no navel battles personally I dont care for them but for those total war fans that do they are not here. they may be a mod or 2 i havent checked!

overall this is an enjoyable game and I am glad to come back and play it all over again with a few exstra nice editions some argue that the remaster doesnt go far enough but the developer was on a shoe string budget and it was only the persistance of the community this was made

* It has better graphics.
* After getting used to it, I prefer the Remaster's UI.
* It feels more well optimized. I've had larger battles than on the original, and it ran fine whereas the original noticeably struggled.
* The battles feel just the same as they did in the original.
* It has some added features that I approve of, though I'll stick with the classic population cost system.
* It's been totally stable for me. The few crashes I've had were from me using incompatible mods. My fault.
* It has a launcher, which includes a small mod manager, and it allows you to jump into the main game, or one of the DLC's. It's a 'good enough' launcher.
* Still has a few bugs from the original, but I wasn't expecting them to fix them, so that's not a problem for me.

Honestly? If you liked the original, odds are you'll like this...once you get used to the UI that is. 

If you want a game with decent empire management and a solid battle experience, this is it. I, personally, find the empire management to be more involving and interesting than most newer Total Wars, albeit it's not as good as Medieval 2's.

The UI is a bit off putting at first but after using it for a few hours I found it to be pretty slick with quick access buttons to everything neatly placed and all the relevant information neatly displayed in a concise manner. My only real complaint here is I liked the original art work for the event messages, which are now displayed in tiny windows at the side of the screen. The original videos for the factions and wonders are no longer included as far as I'm aware. Since this is supposed to be a visual and gameplay upgrade I imagine there was no way to make the original videos in HD hence why they created new art and replacement videos. Not a major problem and it certainly didn't detract from my enjoyment. It was nice to see something new.

Gameplay graphics are vastly improved with 4K Textures. The units, water, and terrain look great and I especially love the look of the coasts and water on the campaign map. I am currently playing on the Vibrant(Original) setting and I personally think it looks spectacular. I did not notice any blurring, and the graphics don't appear cartoonish to me. There are more realistic graphic settings but I have yet to check those out. I'm currently playing with everything set at Ultra, and unit size set to extreme. I haven't encountered any frame rate hits, or major frame rate loss during big battles. Everything seems to run pretty smooth.

I did notice some unresponsiveness in combat with units that are already engaged. My hastati refused to exit combat when I repeatedly ordered them to withdraw so they could cycle back and let the principes take over. Unit movement in combat also seemed sluggish and off at times and the pathfinding in the siege/city battles seems worse than in the original Rome:TW. All the cool unit controls from newer total war titles are now in Rome Remastered such as drawing paths you want your units to follow, and panning the camera around with the WASD keys, etc..

The addition of the Merchant is a nice touch and adds another layer of play on the campaign map. You are limited in how many merchants you can have at one time so it doesn't become an agent spam fest or require too much micro.

Overall, I highly recommend this remaster. It may not be perfect but I dare say that it is a very well done upgrade and it will only get better with time once good mods start rolling out.

Thanks for reading. Chill, and play well!

Total War: Rome Remastered is an Amazing game that deserves more credit than it is getting. I give this game a 9.5 out of 10. Feral Interactive has done an excellent job of remastering such a beloved classic and I love it. I have sunk 270 hours into this game and that should tell you something. It's pure unadulterated fun. 

I'm not going to give you a big long list of every new feature. You can read, so go read the massive list of changes and improvements Feral Int. has added. What I will do however is sum up why this game is great and what needs work. Let us start with the negatives and then finish with the positives. 

The User Interface has been a point of contention in the community with some loving it, some hating it, and some thinking it's just ok. Personally, I love the new UI. But that's just me. Patch 2.0 fixed many of the original issues and added some cool new features such as renaming settlements. However, the UI is still a little intrusive if you don't understand how to manage it. Also, being an original (2004) player I can understand why some returning players would take issue. It's hard to break old habits and accept change once you have a system. Learning a new set up can be a daunting task. However, the UI does not ruin the game. In fact, it is quite helpful once your empire starts to grow. However, I will say this. It needs a little more work. The majority (if not all) of the times Rome Remaster has crashed has been when I have abused the Agents menu. 

Now... lets talk about the positives. First and foremost, this game is just fun. And fun matters. There are so many new improvements and quality of life features that will keep me playing this game for another 20 years. It looks great. It plays easy. It runs incredibly well on my laptop even with maxed out graphics options including experimental unit size. The campaigns are still incredibly fun. Player choice is a key component of this game's longevity and there is a lot of player choice. Battles have been improved vastly over the original game and I do not say that lightly considering Rome Total War's legacy. Weather effects are amazing and battle control is much improved. In fact, you can essentially play this game one handed with just a mouse, I do. 

Overall, I have had a great experience with Total War: Rome Remaster and I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it. To those whomst are returning I implore you to start on a campaign you haven't already played a million times. Everyone has played the Julii. Try the Brutii. If you've beaten the Brutii, then play Greece or Egypt and so on a so forth. To absolutely new players I advise that you shall not master this game in a day. In fact, I've played since 2004 and am still learning the best ways to play the game. Remember, there is no wrong way to play Rome and that is where a lot of fun comes from. 

If you bought this game and played it on release day I highly suggest a revisit. If you're new and considering buying I can tell you personally that this is worth your time. Two hundred and seventy hours of gameplay is nothing to bat an eye at. 

Ultimately, Rome Total War is already a great game and Total War: Rome Remastered just makes it astoundingly better. 

9.5 out of 10

This game has an atmosphere that is just untouchable, the music absolutely sucks me in, i find myself scrolling over my empire just soaking up the ambience this game offers. 

Now this IS a 2004 game, path-finding is a bit touchy during city battles, and diplomacy can be useless at times. recently playing as the Greeks, Pontus offered to become my Protectorate, i agreed, but a couple turns later, they pulled out, i didn't know that could happen.

aside from those minor issues, Barbarian Invasion and Alexander come packaged with the game, which adds 2 different styles to play Rome. Alexander is a race against time to take Persia from King Darius, while Barbarian Invasion is much larger and much harder, set during the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.

2) The game does add merchants like in Medieval 2 and gives you both the barbarian invasion and Alexander DLC with the game and perhaps most importantly, Rome remastered is the most mod friendly total war to date, which gives this game HUGE potential going forward.

The new UI is terrible. 
Makes the eyes tired, it's not intuitive. Everything is cramped on the screen, with small icons and text. 
The city PO/income details that had that very intuitive graphics are now substituted with an excel spreadsheet
The unit and building cards are extremely small, the description text is relegated to a small side pop-in window

Plus, I heard many people, including my friends, having problems with pathfinding. I did not experience it so far, and pathfinding in sieges was always broken in every total war, but if they didn't manage to improve that... I really don't understand what they have ""remastered""

I really can't play this mess. I could try to play some more but 1) my eyes hurt from the horrible experience and 2) I am really considering asking for a refund. If in the next weeks the devs will finally announce to fix the UI, I'll keep it, otherwise I don't want to see this mess in my library

In the current state it is definitely not worth 15$ (let alone the full price)

It maintains a simple, but not too simple gameplay from the original. I really like a lot of the tweaks they made. It is not perfect as some things, like finding where to toggle things, can be difficult. I miss the original UI as i am used to that, however i have found all the information from the original that you may be interested in are still there. There have been a few bugs, nothing too major for me and the option to submit crash reports gives the impression the devs are paying attention and want to patch things which is appreciated. The only thing that really annoy me is how achievements seem a little iffy on triggering and the menu and ui not being toggleable. Overall, love the game and was definitely worth the purchase.
Edit: Patches seem to have improved stability a lot. Pathing in settlements can still be iffy but is much better. The UI updates to the menu is now a little more familiar to original Rome Players and can be mastered on the first playthrough. Autoresolving an a siege when using onagers to assault is heavilly scaled to fail which can be frustrating sometimes. Multiplayer campaign would be amazing but is not yet in the game. Still very fun, the only real negative is that the AI battle difficulty simply buffs the ai units and not to make the ai smarter in battles.

Unfortunately, I still cannot recommend it. In fact, I don't think I'll ever come back to it. Next time I have a craving for some good old fashioned RTW action, I'll just boot up the EB2 mod for M2TW.

Now, just to be clear on a few things:

1, Yes, I absolutely have pink tinted glasses for the original game. That's why I bought the remaster, like 90% of people.

2, It still IS Rome: Total War. Even if they changed up the title. It's an incredibly fun game for oldschool TW fans, or strategy fans in general. And it works. It has some bugs here and there, but they are not game breaking. I had like 2 CTDs in all this time. It's just not justifiable to sell this for 30 EURs in 2021.

3, The developers (Feral Interactive) seem like nice guys by the current standards of the gaming industry. They keep supporting the game after the release, fixing and improving a lot of stuff. The mod support they added in the latest patch looks awesome, too bad I'm not sure if there's gonna be a community to take advantage of it. And the way they made it possible to turn all the new features on/off individually is absolutely the right way to create a remaster.

So why don't I recommend it? Here are some of my biggest gripes:

1, It looks awfully outdated. Like something from 2008. I don't usually care much about graphics, but when your whole pitch for reselling a 20 years old game is updated graphics, then maybe, you know... update the graphics? The campaing map somehow looks worse than in the original. And the biggest crime: unit armor/clothing is still completely the same on all individuals. It's not an engine limitation, M2TW already had this 15 years ago with an updated Rome engine. The only reason I can think of is that they didn't want to invest the time and money to create new texture variations, which is completely unacceptable when free mods with far larger unit counts have this.

2, The UI changes are hit and miss. Some quality of live improvements are very welcome, but some are clear regressions that also impact the gameplay in a major way. Eg. the new follower transfer screen is the worst UX mess I've ever seen. I keep triggering night battles as the attacker and I still don't know how (I don't check the box, at least not on purpose,) and the red line signaling the border of the battlefield is not visible unless you zoom way in. Also, they removed flavor text from the unit cards, followers etc. Not cool.

3, They completely kneecapped the campaing AI. I think it's related to the fact that now the AI can go bankrupt too, it doesn't just get free money. (I can't find any references to it online now, but I remember people mentioned it in YT reviews...) This sounds good on paper, except they neglected to also update the AI so it can actually manage its economy. Even on VH campaign difficulty you'll often see it disband half its army just before a critical battle. Some factions have especially weird behaviors, like the Julii and Gaul keep spamming navies until they can't afford any armies at all, the Brutii not building even basic ports in their starting cities etc.

Conclusion: if you are fan of the original, and can't resist the temptation, don't worry too much. You'll still get your money's worth out of it in terms of hours played. But be prepared to spend those hours with a nagging feeling of disappointment in the back of your mind.
If you haven't played the original: don't buy this. Get M2:TW instead. It's a better game, especially with mods, and works just fine on modern systems.

Fresh divisions will only enter the field once one has been wiped out or retreated off the battle field like substitutes in a football game. you can only field 20 divisions while the enemy can field as many as they have brought. you could have your max 20 divs verse 30, 40, 50 etcs. Pains me truly to say it but this game is worse then the original, only thing better are the graphics.
Edit: city battles are so poor. The design of cities is so bad, you have to go past so many towers (which are some how manned by imaginary man) and loose dozens and dozens of men and then if you're really lucky you'll have your solders run backwards and forwards on the same road as the pathing gets confused. If you're about to do city combat, my advise would be to just sim it and only engage in open maps only.",1620093024,1629643768,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It just works with my brain somehow in a way that I like better than the original. For example, I actually like to be prompted to LOOK at my activity scrolls and alerts before I go on to the next turn. Also, the map and character redesign is beautiful. 

And let's also point out the work that went into making this game work online among all operating systems. That's a pretty impressive technical feat IMO.

I'd recommend it to both new and returning players, but fans of modern Total War games shouldn't expect the same experience. Fans of modern Total War might enjoy Rome II more, if they want to play in this time period.

Rome: Total War was a fantastic strategy game. I find that its battles feel better and are much less visually confusing than in later games. The remaster looks great, runs well, and has some big improvements that don't change the feel of the original game. Plus, you can enable or disable most changes whenever you're starting a campaign (I play with the original population system and no merchants, otherwise remastered). The recent update (in open beta) came as a surprise to me. It's great that the devs are responding to people's initial criticisms and the interface is already being improved.

The original Rome's main weaknesses were its bad history, a.i., and pathing. The badly ahistorical factions, though, work well in gameplay and I greatly prefer them to Rome II's. The remastered a.i. is noticeably better. I wouldn't call the a.i. great, but on higher difficulties it provides a decent challenge and will sometimes beat you when you don't expect. Pathing remains as the biggest issue in the remaster. There have been some changes to it, but it still has issues like dogs not pathing around architecture and dog handlers automatically trying to attack whatever the dogs are attacking.

Rome Total War was a classic that barely runs on modern machines, when it runs at all. This remaster does it justice and gives the player control over what improvements they use. This should be the standard for how to make a remaster because it doesn't compromise between authenticity for old fans and modernization for new players.",1627780144,1627780144,True,17,3,0.620178401470184326,0,True,False,False

It is small, awkward, convoluted, and fussier to a magnitude beyond needing to be. It is to such a point where I would not consider it a remaster but its own game - half of the time I am  (re-)learning how to play the game and not being able to appreciate the upgraded quality of the graphics or the new features. The messages and alerts being tucked away AND then broken down further PLUS not automatically deleting on the end turn (even if you choose the option to the contrary) is frustrating.

It might be myself not having yet found the preference switch to change it otherwise - if only that were a simple manner - but in the original one could start the campaign session, press the space bar once to move increase the speed of the character movements and be done with it. Not in the remaster, where the R button has to be pressed EVERY. SINGLE. TURN. It drives me potty! 

Phalanx units (which are most dependant and effective in ""guard position"") are not so, yet if I press the auto ""guard position"" preference, it does it for melee units such as legionaries or axemen when these troops as I know to be the case are not in ""guard position"" in order to press the attack. The game seems to have lost the distinction in roles between spears and swords in that instance.

As for the camera and panning set up. What. The. Hell. Were. You. Thinking? Even the Classic Total War camera does not handle like the original, and the remaster shifts out of place into near enough looking straight at the grout of the floor making the experience feel rather confined in a siege battle, and terribly disorientating in a field battle. The panning towards the screen edge moves the screen, not rotating as the original does. The third dimensional adjust on the scroll wheel is not intuitive. Nothing makes any sense anymore.  

It takes ages thus to do turns through the campaign game and the battles are more awkward than needing to be. If you want to pay good money for a stressful and unsatisfying user interface for a beloved game that has been given too much hype by FILTHY SIMPING SOYBOY SYCOPHANTS THAT ARE THE BETA TESTERS, MEDELLING DEVELOPERS THAT ARE AS FERAL BY NAME AND BY NATURE - then purchase this absolute Netflix Adaptation of a masterpiece.

No matter your hardware, it's likely to be 20fps or lower, and whilst there's a lot of fixes out there, they don't work consistently and they don't work for everyone.

So whilst it would have been nice for Creative Assembly to actually just patch their original game for free so it actually works, the Remaster seemed like a reasonable compromise, if not a slightly scummy one from their end as they removed the original from sale and forced people to buy the far more expensive version.

So far, so typical of CA and their contempt for their own customers and their continual milking of every aspect of their games in DLC.

Which would all be fine, if the game was actually worth the upgrade price. The problem is, apart from the fact that it actually runs properly on modern systems (again, something that should just have been a patch for the original release), most other aspects of it are worse.

First things first, the game takes an enormous amount of disk space, far more than anything about playing it would suggest is reasonable. If you download the enhanced graphics pack it comes in at about 65gb, which is bigger than Warhammer 2 despite having far less content and looking far worse graphically.

It also removed the iconic menus and loading screens and replaced them with 'just out of art school' level faction portraits, where everyone has slightly off faces.

The UI is needlessly complicated and unintuitive to use. That's not just a matter of being used to the old one either, it's far worse than the modern UI on other total war titles as well. It also just has a LOT of wasted space. Tiny unit icons inside a gigantic marble box where there's more border to the information you need than actual information.

The worst part for me though, and the thing that makes me not want to play it, is the classic camera. Why in God's name Feral did what they did to the camera I have no idea, but it makes every battle a chore. If you use the remastered camera, good for you, it seems similar to the modern titles. If you want to use the FPS/RTS camera that the original game offered (what the remaster calls CLASSIC camera), then you are out of luck.

Two things. One, the game will reset itself to the Remastered Camera EVERY SINGLE TIME you start it. They clearly don't want you using the Classic camera because their own game refuses to remember your settings and requires you to fiddle around every session changing it back.

More importantly, they've changed the camera angle in Classic to be about 20 degrees steeper than it was in the original game. Or in any other Total War game, for that matter, as I went back and checked on both Rome 2 and Warhammer 2 where I use that same 'classic' camera with no problems.

Even Rome Gold, the original release they've now removed has the camera at a reasonable angle where you can see both the horizon and your troops perfectly well, as well as the enemy army, all at a glance. With the new classic camera angle, the camera looks down from a far more vertical angle so you can't see any of the horizon AT ALL, and you can only see approaching enemy armies when they are quite close.

There is no reason for this that I can see, and I pray to god either Feral or more likely, knowing how these things go, fixes this needlessly stupid issue. Patch it so it remembers my camera options, and so that I can actually see anything when using my preferred camera option.

Oh, and also they've disabled the middle mouse click to look around/angle the camera, when in classic as well, despite later titles allowing you to do that no problem.

It may seem like some minor complaints, but they all add up to CA asking people for a lot more money to play an overall worse version of a game they've now removed from sale, that takes up a massive chunk of your drive for no discernible reason.

Honestly, it feels like the worst kind of low effort cash grab. One that trades on nostalgia at the expense of a once great game.

EDIT: Okay, so after the recent beta patch they've finally fixed the Classic Camera resetting bug (two months in, but still, it's fixed) and added a FOV slider so that the classic camera actually allows you to see the enemy army and the horizon as it did in the original game.

So now, I would say I do recommend the game, although it's still far too expensive so get it on sale in six months or so, and it's also still a ridiculous file size for what you get. There's just no excuse for this game to take up as much hard drive space as it does. Still, if you're a fan of the original and can't play it on a modern system any more, AND you can get this cheap, it does now scratch that itch following the most recent patch. But be aware, it still has bugs, including it still resets HUD size for unit status during battles EVERY time, and communication and time between patches is very long.",1619945688,1627056204,False,3,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Now my wish has come true.

Rome Remastered brings all the fun of what is arguably the best Total War game into the present...well, almost.  While the graphics are much better, they still show their age; there was only so much Feral could do with the original engine.  Having said that, things look a LOT better than in the old game.

Another thing they brought forward from the old game is a number of bugs that will take you back to 2004, plus the introduction of several new ones, but with today's massive list of bug fixes in the Beta announcement for patch 2 Feral clearly still cares for the game and wants to make it work.

They've also added several features that have produced mixed reactions, but which I consider definite improvements -- such as improved UI and camera controls, better agent management, and merchants (a la Medieval 2).  

I'm not sure how this game will come across to new players, but if you loved the original and have been wishing the Total War series would get back to that style of game, this is definitely for you.

The Good:
- Classic Total War play (love having the pre-battle speeches back!)
- Improved graphics (including weather effects, unit randomisation, etc)
- Jeff Van Dyck's BAFTA-nominated music
- Improved camera controls
- Improved UI (with some backwards steps, but those are getting fixed in the next patch)
- Merchant units
- Agent levelling is more forgiving
- Realistic unit colours option (no more bright scarlet for the Julii!)
- Frequent useful autosaves (turn start, battle start, turn end)
- A notification appears if you leave units idle for multiple turns (i.e. that one agent you keep forgetting to move)
- I'm not much into modding, but about half the fixes in the next patch are for the modding community, so that community has not been forgotten

The Bad:
- Bugs brought forward from the old game, such as the game getting stuck in a subset loop when cycling through agents
- Some commonly-used elements of the UI require multiple clicks instead of being conveniently displayed
- Some list windows display in the centre of the screen, blocking the view of the selected city/unit on the campaign map
- Area-of-fire display for ranged units not accurate on slopes
- Long load times
- The city build background noise track can get stuck so that it keeps playing even when you've gone into combat
- The AI still cheats like crazy, especially with its ability to spawn units and generals seemingly at will 

The Ugly:
- Unit pathing is somehow actually worse than in the original game (but they seem to be working on this)

I had tried to enjoy this game. I knew that back then we did not expect much from games and that Rome being presented for a modern gamer might disappoint. However, this remaster does not adequately address major issues and does not bring quality of life improvements. New interface is even worse. AI seems to have gotten worse with developers messing with the code. Gameplay is a same mess. Enemies spamming you with fully stacked armies every few turns and you can lose out of nowhere because some AI faction which you had never seen managed to meet victory conditions. If developers were going for remake, this falls spectacularly short of a proper remake. If developers had tried to make a remaster, they had failed doing that. It is grossly overpriced for a remake and it messes up with the original game for no good reason.

[h1]Individual Issues[/h1]

[b]Pathing[/b]

Pathing does not work. Units constantly unsure what to do. Fail to form formations in time, fail to charge up the gates, fail to form up near the gates. It is a mess.

[b]AI[/b]

AI is brain dead easy. Most of the time it won't do anything and when it does, it gets such immense bonuses from expertise that you can send several elite units, surround enemy unit from all sides, charge them and you will still lose. Gameplay is broken.

[b]Campaign[/b]

Campaign map is broken. I was playing campaign and I lost. How did I lost? Some power in a middle of nowhere which I never met had fulfilled victory condition. What the hell? AI does not have victory conditions. Only a player has victory conditions. Now I had lost 17 hour run to an AI with which I never interacted with and I'm supposed to be happy? Better luck next time?

[b]Interface[/b]

Interface is completely atrocious. It is small, it is difficult to find what you are looking for and has no flavor text.

Its an amazing game, but mostly due to the nostalgia of a simpler time in life for those that had the original. 

All the cheesey strats you know and love from the original remain but with much better performance and graphics.

Many reviews on here are true, it is the same game and has some of the same weird quirks from the original, some can be frustrating, but, you cant not love them, good or bad. Performance issues, I havent had any, throughout all my hours on this. 

It is never going to compete on the level of a new release game. To hold it to that standard is to lose sight of what is to love about Rome TW. Truely a classic and hopefully thanks to this remaster, will have an extended life for years to come. One that I will always return to and probably never uninstall. 

Plus, achievements for gameplay now, satisfaction is immeasurable. To bastardise a quote from 'Kingdom of Heaven.'

Only really stopped playing it because it became unstable on later versions of Windows and multiple screens.

Unfortunately this ""remaster"" is just a cash grab based on nostalgia. Anyone that played the game a lot would have told you the same things about the original game: they loved it but it had the following issues:

Original Game Issues:
- Terrible map AI (ally with them, they attack you for no reason 2 turns later)
- No multiplayer campaign map.

With the remaster they changed:
- The UI for no reason and it feels much worse / micromanaged.
- Implemented (copy paste) merchants mechanic from Medieval II: Total War which no one cares about.
- Improved graphics (who cares, the original graphics were not even that bad)

Lets start of with some positives. Claiming land and going to war is generally fun. Combat (when it works) can be a satisfying experience. Graphics and design choices aren't bad, with mostly everything looking fine for the most part. Game keeps a consistent frame rate, which is pretty much the only good thing I will say about this game's optimization. The game has a lot of content and would generally be worth the money.....

IF THIS REMAKE WASN'T A FLAMING PILE OF DOG POO. Like my god is this game rough. For starters, load times are absolutely horrendous and can sometimes take as long as 2-4 minutes on startup. Which might not sound long on paper but i assure you when you're just staring at your monitor, slowly watching the load bar creep up, it feels like an eternity. The AI is mostly brainless and takes forever to do anything. Seriously, you couldn't speed up the AI at all with this remake? From what I understand, AI turn loading times are generally slower than the original. Persistent crashing issues plagued every hour of the 15 hours i spent with this game. Which is only made worse by the atrocious load times!

I don't understand. Isn't the point of remake to iron out some kinks, add quality of life improvements, and generally make the game more appealing to modern audiences, effectively becoming the definitive version of the game? From what I've seen, this game is every bit WORSE than the original. I was really excited and pretty eager to play this, as I am a decently big Civ 5, and Paradox interactive fan. I wanted to give the Total War franchise a shot, however this game has just soured me to the whole experience. I might play the original seeing as how it comes bundled with the remake. If i hear about some major improvements to the game, I might pick it up again and change my review. It just sucks because underneath all of these problems is a genuinely fun game to play.

what I like
1. The audio and visuals
2. the ""new"" playable factions
3. the fact it comes with both dlc
4. it still feels like Total war Rome i played nearly a decade ago
5. the fact you can change what the unit colors are with the Realistic/Vibrant unit color setting (vibrant looks stunning, and realistic looks really cool i cant decide which i like better)

what i dislike
1. the Battle/campaign UI is pretty weird but not completely awful ive played almost 10 hours and im still not sure how i feel about it 
2.AI movement and pathfinding is still bad but no where near as bad as it used to be in the original game.
3. a small nitpick but the wonder videos are missing (there is a mod to add the originals in)

other than that im really enjoying the game it completely met my expectations for a REMASTER not a remake, if you want to play the game that put this game on the map but without the old graphics and which newish mechanics then i 100% recommend!",1625790869,1625790869,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, the user interface of Rome Remastered is WAY over-the-top and completely unnecessary. The classic user interface was easy enough to follow and certainly would do Rome Remastered a massive service by making a much needed game update that restores the classic user interface, or even just something trimming all of the ""fat"" of menus and information that doesn't really impact how you play the game, and especially the things that takes away the fun of playing this game. The user interface is what keeps me from being  in love with this game, and I sure do hope that they attempt to fix it soon. 

The thing that annoys me the most is all the extra clicking though multiple menus, and even worse, the notification system is quite notorious. It is NOT fun to have to manually go through 4 notification tabs and read urgent messages. Plus you can't move on to the next turn if you have not read certain messages. Why not do what the classic game did and have all messages just drop down the side? It literally takes maybe 20 seconds to sift through them all like that rather than individually having to click on EVERY SINGLE ONE. And my final complaint is that I REALLY FREAKING LOVED that you could move your capital anywhere you wanted it to be in the classic version! And that's a modern total war feature that I DO NOT LIKE.

I like how the switched up the family tree somewhat because it does make it less huge and overwhelming as the game progresses, but even so the family tree is a even bigger chore to look through now and less straight-forward. The land battles in this game are still just as fun as classic, but I really do wish that they would consider adding a naval battle aspect to the game. Considering this is a remaster, it feels naked without it since even classic didn't have one.

Despite everything that I have said, you can still have fun playing this game and I think its worth a try. This game has loads of potential even though it is not perfect in its present state, and loads of Rome Total War fans who want it to be perfect. But I have no doubt that it could be everything that the original classic game was meant to be and possibly more. It just needs some much needed updates please and thank you!

But there are issues: it doesnt feel polished, and some of the changes made are clearly detrimental:
1. UI takes much more micro MGMT to navigate then the original. I doubt that in 2021 an average PC player cares how much space a report page take up, that is not an issue: having to use multiple pages, windows, and scrollbars is an issue though and this game is riddled with these. There is not one instance where there is not a scrollbar in there or having to open another window to get what you want. Sadly the original is way better designed UI wise
2. Unit cards have been remade but they are objectively worse then any of the TW cards I have seen. They have spacing, alignment issues and show very little detail - also too tiny considering again that we are often playing on 4k monitors now with almost a meter width
3. New camera is much worse IMO but this might be viewed differently by others I have seen positive reviews on the new camera. Still: if you want to disable it, it will reset every time the game starts up (bug)

The above is only for changes to the original
There is a lot to be said that there are no new factions but this is defended by the game being a remaster (which doesn't really mean anything)

If you are a fan of the original, you might enjoy this if you look past the above (there is a mod that has simply upscaled the original unit cards to 4k and looks exactly right) otherwise avoid.

Some background
I am what is sometimes referred to as a Total War Boomer. I mainly played Rome and Medieval 2, and I know and love the mechanics of these games.Total War (and gaming in general) has made a lot of progress since Rome was first released, most of these changes are good, however I do not have the time and energy to invest in learning the mechanics of newer Total War games, the new games therefore have little appeal to me. I also play a little guitar, and the first song I learned to play in full was Transilvanian Hunger by Darkthrone.

The pro's
* I can play Rome Total War again!
* I can play a Total War game of which the mechanics I understand.
* The graphics update is really good, it may not be as detailed as some of the modern Total War games, yet it manages to look fresh and familiar.
* The updated campaign map gets some criticism, yet I really like the bright and living colours of this map.
* Some slight improvements were made, making the barbarian factions better playable at the endgame and the AI a bit smarter.
* Diplomacy can actually work now.
* Steam achievements were added including one named Transilvanian Hunger, which I like since I can play that song!

The cons
* The new UI is horrible and counterintuitive, even once you get used to it, it just is not good.
* Pathfinding is still bad, especially during sieges. During normal battle's I prefer the pathfinding to the newer Total War, because I know how it works, I understand this can be a real turn off if you play newer Total War games.

Conclusion
* Buy this if you are a Total War boomer who wants to play a Total War game you know , love and understand.
* Buy this if you like Total War in general and it is on sale.
* Don't buy this if you don't like playing outdated games.

Now I'm off to start a short Dacia campaign to get that Transilvanian Hunger achievement.",1624893398,1624893398,True,3,0,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,False

TLDR: The game feels like a free open source linux remake of the original. The sum of all parts is here, but it can feel lifeless or without personality. Everything is here, but everything feels just a tad off. Worth buying, if you love Rome and the company will keep investing. Not a tragedy, not a miracle. Probably would buy again for the half price.

UI: Some aspects of the new UI are good, like the summary circle over a unit in battle, some not so much in that they feel rushed or unfunished. I.e. the horrible bar at the bottom of the campaign map.

Gameplay: Feels smooth and there have been obvious improvements, it just feels off. When units move, charge, etc... This is Rome, but it is not at the same time. Again, feels like an unprofessional freeware remake / mod.

Graphics: The game looks good. This is Rome 1, so I was not expecting Rome 2. I like the vibrant cartoony colours more than the dark tones of Rome 2. 

Performance: The game runs well. Turns are quick on the campaign map. Feels like a mobile game, though.

Controls: Feel weird or oversimplified. Like a mobile game.

Here is an update after some time and coming back to Rome 1:

Many things are missing here, quoting the limitations of the original engine (backwards compatible mod support), but what you get is not that much. Modern resolutions and good FPS. However, the load times are eggregious. For game that looks nowhere near Warhammer II or Rome II, you get the same loading times. The campaign map or the game does not look better. I would actually argue that for the most part, things look the same. The load times alone make me go back to playing the original Rome and the hdd space is not negligible either, even without the graphics pack. As an idea, the Rome Remaster is sweet.

The game is clearly a remaster, exactly as advertised, not a ground-up remake.  I'd guess they kept the low-poly models and reskinned with higher resolution textures.  I did download the hi-res texture pack and can't say I noticed a difference.

About me: I played this game during my late teens years in the mid 2000s. I had a copy of the pirated DVD version which I bought it off a pirated DVD shop for about 10 SGD. No updates available and the game was full of glitches and bugs.

Despite all this glitch, nonetheless RTW gave me a childhood and I would worked around to avoid those glitches and spent a hella time during those days playing. In fact this is properly the Single Player game which I spent the most time on. I literally would play the same campaign at all difficult level. The complexity and depth of the campaign mode would capture my attention span, so completely and before I realise the clock, ROME TOTAL WAR took up my whole day! And I havent even had my breakfast! Solving the campaign problems help me as a child to develop some good mathematics skill and I would honestly credit RTW for my mathematics grades in school. Currently I'm pursuing a masters degree on AI, considerably inspired by this game.
Consider those days when AI was not well-developed,for me the original RTW game was a masterpiece.

On 22 June 2021 I noticed this game new on store, read the description, sounds exciting and reminded of good old days and decided to give it a try. Again it absorbed me fully into the campaign. Immdiately, I clocked approx 70 hours over 4 days on this game, just to finish one of the most basic campaign with the House of Julius.  (Conquer the whole map with a few protectorates factions to mess around as per how I want)




PROS OF THIS GAME:
 Well if it is the game thing as what I spent for 10SGD back in late 2000s, for the campaign mode, I would already recommend any parents with kids 9-18yo to buy this game for sure. 38.50SGD is what it cost now. but still no complaints on price. Its not expensive, but its not cheap either, so make sure you will spend time on it if you buy this. 

The remastered version has plenty of AI interaction improvement over the pirated version which I played 15years back.
It also has more controls/scenario features which are newly added. Making the game situations more realistic/rewarding and meaningful to solve.

Let me name a few improvement (For those who happened to play the game before) Skip below if you never played the game before.
*****************************************
1. AI's diplomacy management make some sense now. They will consider becoming protectorates, argue and bargain with you and you can work towards what you want out of them if its possible and meaningful to them. These can still be improve tremendously though. Their intelligence is like 3yo fighting for toys. 
2. I realised it is more easier to get positive traits out of my characters by rushing academies.
3. Characters can now spawn on non capital settlement and this is so important if you are expanding and need governor characters in settlements everywhere on the map before they age.
4. Many other meaningful minor mod added to make the game more interesting and more complex way to achieve a deeper depth of interesting effects on campaign 
5. Many retarded situation initiated by the senate have been removed/replaced/upgraded.
6. Far away settlements from capital can be managed practically with lots of micromanagement needs making you rich by expanding territory, fairly easy, I managed to conquer the whole map and accumulate an income stream of 150k denari income per turn with lots of unused soldiers everywhere (i dont bother to save money, give out gift alot and lazy to disband unused units). 
I find this ridiculously hard in the past as all the city will revolt no matter what u do with extremely powerful rebel units popping out within one turn after revolt which doesnt make sense. 
7. In battles the AI could work their way to exploit your soldiers flanks, in the past the general unit charge into me like a retard and for the rest of the work its pretty much about moving lots of light calvary effectively to routs the remaining enemy units. (This is not improved comprehensively yet though you could still bait the AI general unit out with 80 IQ)
******************

The campaign is more meaningful and interesting to capture attention to continue playing for long hours yet at the same time you work your mind to get the game scenario effect you want. This for me is the most important attribute of RTW. 

Other valuable strength of the game: The game offer lots of historical knowledge, If you like ancient Roman culture and problem solving games or if you miss your childhood and want a modern mod version to run the game on windows 10. This game is like a big mod patch over the original one which focus alot on AI interaction improvement. (Especially the campaign mode interactions), 




CONS OF THE GAME
Many silly glitches found in the mid 2000s game are still not fixed after 15 years..
*for those who played this and wanna know the details****************
1.Units get stuck on the wall. during climbing siege tower and climbing down to proceed to city square hastily just like how it used to be, Units as good as useless if it get stuck, or it will take a very very long time to unstuck itself. This is usually caused by overcrowding of your own units when you are fighting for the wall.
2.Units no sense of urgency to take over wall considering the game requires you to take over city square within a time frame.
3. During campaign, game crashes every 3 hours during the first 24 hours I play the game, subsequently it seems to stop as I run the game longer. Maybe becus the game is no longer as resource draining after I destroyed majority of the factions.
In battle modes,  Not sure. This is shameful for a 38.50SGD game.
4. Many undesired glitches noted brought over from 2000s days which is unacceptable for 2021 games.
5. The new battle interface is NOT AN IMPROVEMENT  like what the game store description said. It  is a NEW MODIFICATION, properly mainly for the sake of windows 10 compatibility!! And it takes lots of effort to adapt if you are used to the old interface. 
The new interface has some improvement compared to the older one, its offer more methodology to control ur units but it also removed some of the older features and has many glitches. Not easy to describe the glitches on a review, need screenshots and instruction to trigger the glitch. You will understand what I mean as you play. But I promised you I did my homework, googled thoroughly that I didnt misunderstood the game interface before I call it 'glitch'. So it is an undesirable glitch. 

if you buy this game because you had read the game description listed at steam of how the new interface would make the game more fun to thrilling to play, you will be mad at the developers after 30 mins gaming, like the other reviewers!
Again I want to highlight the new interface was developed to be compatible to Windows 10, not to make the game more enjoyable.


CONCLUSION::
Dont buy this game if you expect something way more/different than what it is in the 2000s just because you buy it as a new game unit. 
Dont buy this game based on what you read on the store description. You will be disappointed, make another bad review to ruin this game reviews and soon we will run out of patches.

Buy it if you like Ancient Roman culture and also want to work around to play this masterpiece game from the 2000s with a big mod patch focusing on more meaningful AI interaction in the campaign mode, go for it. 
Back in the days on with old version, there are many mod patches developed by fans to improve the gameplay experience. But even still, there isn't many mods from there that are anywhere close to what this 2021 ROME remastered have to offer.
Consider buying this for your kids (9yo+) if you want to boost their mathematics grade in school.
 

Anyway looking at the other reviews I feel this game will not survive on steam for very long. So you might wanna wait and see for price change. Lol.",1624660794,1624661871,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately the advent of Windows 10 made it (along with most of the rest of my games on disc) difficult, if not impossible to play. The Steam version worked, but lagged badly, which took away a lot of the enjoyment that this game once gave me. Needless to say, I was ecstatic to learn that there would be a remastered version. I made my pre-ordered purchase and waited eagerly for the day that I could once again lead the Julii to their rightful domination of the known world!

Unfortunately, the remastered version has been pretty disappointing. The colour of the maps is nice, but putting all the pop-up screens in beige (I know, it's supposed to be ""marble"") with faint gray letters are a major strain on these old eyes. The ease of access that was so appreciated in the original version is also gone. I now find myself flipping through multiple pop-ups to find the simplist of information that I need. Adding merchants (which I've never liked) was another fail. Merchants were a poor addition to Total War: Medieval 2 (where the AI always seems to have merchants that can easily destroy the player's ones) and a very unnecessary addition to the remastered version. Overall, the remastered Rome is a bust.

The good news for the Total War franchise is that the majority of the fixes are simple. Change the colour schemes back to the original palettes. Make the lettering darker and easier to read. Keep the merchants or not. They're mostly a distraction, but you might as well leave them in unless their removal is also a simple fix. If possible, change the access screens back to the original version's. The beauty of the original game lies in it's simplicity. ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it!"" Maybe TW can make an updated version patch that fixes and restores the glory that was once Total War: Rome.

Until then, I'd wait for a heavy discount on the purchase price, or hope that your original version doesn't lag.

Well, based on my experience so far:
1. the graphics are better and there are a few extra options such as being able to ""spin"" the campaign map making it easier to get to some units or to have a different view;
2. the AI is different and [b]probably[/b] better (well I thought it was);
3. the building benefits are explained rather than being ""left to the reader's imagination"", and things like academies and walls explicitly affect population happiness;
4. the advent of Steam achievements is a nice plus;
5. this brings hope that there will be support into the future for the game when graphics and/or operating systems change.

So why wouldn't you get this?
1. disc space: RTW Gold took about 4GB, but this takes 45GB or thereabouts;
2. processor: I tried this on my old machine that runs RTW happily and... The actual game play seemed to run OK once started, but as soon as there was a context shift in the action it was time to make coffee;
3, extras or annoyances? There are extras brought in from other TW games and I can't decide if they add depth or just complication.  For example, the ""merchant subsystem"" is still largely a mystery to me: I can see that it could be interesting in simulating ancient trade routes, but is it really that much of an add?

So on my new machine, I will keep playing this, but on the older machines I'll be on RTWAu. This is different enough to be worth the money.",1624373068,1624373068,True,19,5,0.592342078685760498,0,True,False,False

I was not a fan of the political system, which was nearly entirely abstract and really added nothing to the game play, it really just got in the way most of the time. The way a general's retinue worked always bothered me, and it really was just a complicated back-end making both army and settlement management way more cumbersome than it should have been, but improperly managing it could significantly impact any campaign's outcome for the worse. Army management otherwise was fun and interesting but some … let's say questionable … unit types, mostly either anachronistic or outright non-existent historically (Arcani, I am looking at you).  It got stale.

Then I got TW:Rome 2 (Emperor Edition, which apparently fixed many earlier problems that I did not know about), and thoroughly enjoyed playing that. Really, the only thing about Rome 2 that I missed from Rome 1 was the ability for individual cohorts (basically) to march out on their own; all armies had to be led by a general. That was a minor quibble really. The naval combat was interesting a couple of times, but once the novelty wore off it was quickly evident that auto-resolving naval battles was a better use of time even if it was a less effective method to prosecute naval campaigning. The general's retinue system worked much more logically to me, and the political system was still reasonably abstract but I had a lot more input on it, so it was far more interesting. The intrigue units (spy, champion, dignitary) were similar to the original, but added depth to the game in a more natural way.

CA, Feral, et cetera, they remastered the wrong game. They tout the 4K graphics, but running it on a 4K monitor at 4K is actually too much for the engine to handle, and crashes it. Officially, support said to instead run it at 1080 resolutions, at which I raise a skeptical eyebrow. The ""refinements to gameplay"" seems to basically just be the addition of the ""merchant"" unit to the intrigue spy, assassin, and diplomat cache, and if there are some underneath improvements they are not at all obvious.

If you absolutely loved TW: Rome, did not like TW: Rome 2, don't mind that the game doesn't really run that well at high resolutions, and absolutely have to have a TW: Rome game, then you might get your money's worth out of TW: Rome Remastered.

If you are not in that camp, you will be wasting your money.

Well,.... no. To be honest the revamped user interface is a big step down from the original. Overcomplicated, less intuitive and TINY. It sucks my enjoyment of this classic and great game away because of it. It is, in my humble opinion also overpriced (i paid 30 bucks for it).

Just my 50 cents. But no. I personally regret buying it and i consider this game among the worst in the series overall.

1. (Bug) My reinforcement army got stuck outside the red-line boundary, thus they were not usable and I lost the battle.
2. UI looks like a mobile game. Information is tucked away behind several different button presses (something mobile would benefit from). Clicking a city should automatically bring up build menus, but no, you have to bring those menus up yourself for each city. It just gets tedious, trust me. 
3. The AI declares war without notice and nearly right after a ceasefire is issued and does this repeatedly. I don't want Gandhi from Civ, please. 
4. Pathfinding is horrible, units clump up in town streets and lose formation with nearly every move command. My units would go backwards and diagonally to the center of a street before proceeding forward down said street in the direction I ordered them before. They could simply...you know...move down the street without retreating first and turning around?
5. The AI still drives their entire army into your one city gate, when they (in my cases) have had other siege engines making openings in my walls.
6. Very long load times, 2-4 minutes roughly. Rome 2's initial load was relatively quick and same with its battles compared to this. The graphics are not THAT amazing to warrant such a slow load (no I do not own a toaster PC).
7. Tried playing the campaign as Julii twice now, and both times losing to Egypt on medium difficult without ever seeing them or being able to stop them (short campaign). This happened both times before I passed 50 turns and barely making it far enough to produce Triarii, a mid-tier unit. Is this working as intended??

The graphics are nicer compared to the original Rome and yes, it runs more smoothly, and without crashes so far. I would not buy this for $30 until some updates come through to fix at least the biggest issue, pathfinding and AI movement.

UI? Absolutely terrible. I don't know what monkey thought that this is a mobile/tablet game, and I am not sure who actually tried to play this game extensively in QA.

I would not recommend this game until this issue is fixed. Crashing was not an issue before the June patch (only one crash in roughly 30 hours) but since the patch the game has crashed probably 30-40 times in 10 hours.

Original review

It's a really great remaster. One of the top complaints is about the UI, but once I was used to it, I prefer it to the original. The addition of a summery overlay is really helpful and makes for some good eye candy once you get a large enough empire built up. AI is somehow worse than the original, and I have extremely long load times with sieges (which is what a majority of your battles will be), despite having the game installed on my SSD and having more than enough capability on my hardware.

One thing to keep in mind is any mods installed will disabled achievements, which is unfortunate. Most of them are fairly benign in nature (such as replacing unit cards with upscaled original) and don't change the gameplay at all.

Overall though, I enjoy the remaster and would give it a 8/10. Would happily see a remaster of the other older Total War games, especially Med 2.",1622414599,1623963135,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Some of the changes are great....

So it breaks my heart that I hate this game. I've tried twice now to get into it and it's just a broken mess.

The UI is awful. It takes so much longer to do anything then it use to. It's just a slog. A real grind. Nothing is easy to use. Nothing is intuitive. It just makes me want to quit within 30 minutes. Who thought this UI was a good idea? Seriously. Wind it back.

Somehow I am losing all my FPS playing on 1080p with a beast of a gaming PC. I had to turn down the settings for crying out loud.

The AI is worse than the original. Somehow, I do not know how.

The game has lost all its soul. Just make the game prettier, fix up the AI a bit and wind back pretty much everything else you did.",1622181479,1623925050,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Which is a shame, because it didn't need to be a no.

But here's why it is:
New UI isn't upto much with tiny text. 
Graphics aren't improved that much if you're running on an old machine - I can run Napoleon or Shogun 2 on full specs and have it look great or i can have this on bare bones graphics.
Textures randomly pop out on the campaign map.
Pathfinding is awful - on the battle map but especially in cities.
Diplomacy is just as bonkers as the original.
Merchants are crap (they don't feel nearly is useful as in M2TW).

Despite all this i still put countless hours into a Carthage campaign for old times sake - and i learnt to live with the quirks.
Here's what did work for me:
New music sounds great.
Solid nostalgia kick.
3 games in one! 
The only way, short of running windows on a virtual machine, to play RTW on a mac.

However, disaster struck.

After the recent patch, my campaign map is now a series of black lines with no terrain, textures or graphics whatsoever, making the game unplayable.

So for now, and until CA sorts out their attempts at remasters and patches, the game is dead to me, and Rome is lost.",1623879933,1623879933,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember playing TW:ROME as a kid, but don't remember any details.

So I thought ""I remember liking it as a kid, why not try the remastered version?""

Pros:
- Looks pretty - the colors are very lush.
- Lighting effects and shadows are really well done and look great.
- Lots of variety in playable empires/kingdoms, and how they individually play. Not as much variety as Warhammer, but Earth doesn't have dragons or magic.
- They added some quality of life improvements from the more modern games, including better unit control (you can hold ALT+click-drag to re-position your entire army in the same formation), and better visual aids for positioning units.
- Pretty faithful to the original.

Cons:
- Poorly optimized. For reference, I can play Battlefield 1 capped at 1440p 100fps (144hz monitor), all settings set to ULTRA, and the hottest I've seen my GPU get was 73C with lots of smoke and fog effects.
TW: ROME? The campaign map never went past 100fps, and my graphics card hit 83C just... sitting there on the campaign map. Battlefields fare much better, only hitting 63C for a 20v20 battle.
- Poor unit responsiveness - it takes a few seconds for your units to acknowledge your commands. I know that's faithful to the original, but it makes everything feel so bad and clunky. I thought it was a bug at first - what kind of RTS has your units take half an hour to respond to your commands? If I wasn't spoiled by the more modern TW games, then this probably wouldn't have been a issue for me.
- The UI doesn't scale too well for resolutions larger than 1080p.
- Diplomacy is still as dumb as ever
- AI doesn't feel improved at all - enjoy 20 year old AI!


In the end, I ended up refunding this fairly quickly. I just couldn't get over the fact my computer sounded like it was going to take off like a plane, and I just kept getting frustrated trying to control my army in battle.

The visual units do not look that much better than the original. The team that was in charge of the styling has utterly failed this game. Even the map looks worse than the original. 

The only positive thing I have to say is that they added a 'Merge units' button. That's it. Everything else is visually displeasing even if you didn't play the original. I tested this with 3 other people that have not played the original. The original was much more immersive and visually pleasing. 

TL;DR: This remaster is a failure. Many choices they have made had objectively made it inferior to the original. It does not flow nicely anymore, the UI is hot garbage and extremely unpleasant, the units don't look that much better, there is nothing of value in this remaster.",1623448806,1623448806,False,2,0,0.501733124256134033,0,True,False,False

It has problems. The interface is not great, but you can get used to it. The pathfinding is wonky. Units sometimes wont listen to you. The AI is not that smart and diplomacy... well let's just say the game is called Total War not Total Peace.

Alas, I got over it in my first campaign as the Roman House of Julii, which I ragequit. After that I wanted to experience some Eastern Faction, so I picked the Seleucids because they have Legionnaires and Phalanxes, and they're a successor of Alexander. I allied Egypt and focused my conquests on Parthia, Armenia and after that on Pontus. By the Time I got to Pontus, Egypt Betrayed me. 

I'm Having a lot of fun with this campaign, figuring out how to counter the enemy, how to best use my Phalanx based army etc. 

In Troy, sieges are a pain. But here they are fun because My Phalanxes exceed on the streets >:) 
My archers aren't great but they work well with Hired Cretan Archers.  


Overall, I'd recommend this game for newcomers to TW, on a sale, or even full price for the nostaliga. Plus, the modding community is active. There's going to be a lot of great mods for this game :)",1623431538,1623431538,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite some graphical improvements and minor add-ins, the user interface has been changed and it is more tiring to use, leading to a lot of attrition in a game that is made for long plays. [/h1]

Specifically, this is Rome Total War. Every turn you basically go to towns and queue up units and buildings. In the classic version, it was very simple. You double-clicked on a town, it opened the build menu, you picked something and next to it was the recruitment menu and you picked something from there. Moreover, you could just press the left or right arrow to do this and go to the next town. I remember playing the game and worrying if I spent too much time building and recruiting, but now, with this remaster, I realized how good, simple and efficient the old system used to be. 

In the new version, you click on a town. You can't double click anymore to open the build interface. You click once, then you click a small button from the lower right part of the screen to open the build menu, then click to build. Then you have to close this and open a different tab to train units. AND you can't cycle through the towns because of the same problem that you still need to do this for every town.

This might have been a nitpick but this is Rome Total War. You have to do this all the time. I started a new campaign and eventually quit because I was so bored and tired of how this mechanism is used-which is part of the core experience. You can even auto-resolve battles, but you need to do proper town management to get anywhere in this game. 

Besides this, reading unit and building info is now harder, in non-changeable small font, you need to perform more operations to find it and you lose some neat features such as mouse wheel click to zoom into a unit or that neat feature where you could pause the game and read about some cool unit that you encounter. Or read about buildings in settlements that you do not own. 

Sadly a lot of the features that provided great immersion in this game are gone. 
What is better is some better graphics at the expense of load times. Merchants are added but they are much more tedious to use than in Medieval 2 total war. Seriously, now you need to recruit merchants and always micromanage them to not be in their town of origin. This imposes a lot of extra micromanagement in a game that was otherwise already too full of it. 

The only real improvement I see in this version is the ability to play some Barbarian Invasion factions from the get-go such as Slavs, Romano-British and maybe one or two others, but that's about it.

All in all, if you enjoyed the classic version, stick to it. This version does not add anything to it that improves the core experience but only detracts in some aspects such as immersion. I know that they tried to make the game 'more modern', but making it a semi-mobile game for a PC game is just not good market tailoring.

Update: For a comparison I replayed today the Brutti in the Old Version. I could go through a playthrough of conquering about 20 regions in several hours and it's ok.

The game has 2 launchers you have to go through, with one being pointless, and the other having options that should have been left in the game itself. Before it lets you play it then stops you with a prompt requesting you to send them crash reports. It gives you 2 more prompts on the menu about the campaign, which they should have put in the campaign menu.

There's 2 idents that both feel like jumpscares as the volume is so high and their sounds suddenly kick in. The intro of the original remains better even as a low resolution 4:3 video, as the intro to this one was clearly thrown together. The menu backgrounds look like they were done with the simple brush tool in MSPaint and have awkward animations - far worse than the original backgrounds (that were subtle). They added (useless) tips to loading screens (that already had a quote in them) which feel like trying to listen to 2 songs at the same time, as the attention should have been focused on just one.

Where the original had decent optimisation to bring so many soldiers onto the screen, which seemed groundbreaking at the time, this remake 17 years later suffers with a poor framerate. By default you're only able to use a few factions. The campaign tutorial dragged on for about an hour, I was still confused about several mechanics that aren't explained, and the game wouldn't even let me save the campaign when the tutorial was finished. It [i]finally[/i] let me save my progress awhile later, but the unit size was then stuck on small - the scale of the game felt underwhelming.

The campaign objective was to hold 15 provinces, but a notification said that Egypt was suddenly close to that, but I couldn't even see them on the map so it felt disconnected, if not just metagaming to react to. They're so far away that it was irrelevant, why would I try to rush forces all the way across the Mediterranean when so many factions randomly attack the armies and navies around Italy itself? Wasn't the game supposed to be about having fun playing as Rome? Why would you want that stopped just because of what some uncontacted faction was doing?

[b]Arguable features[/b]
Certain mechanics didn't have to be in the game, I can only give you my perspective on things that frustrated me. Like the fog of war existing in your own lands which makes ""controlling"" a province meaningless - yet it's a campaign victory condition. It left me wishing the objective of the game was more tangible. Regiments spread out when moving, which can make them unintentionally bump into enemy regiments. I was 5 hours in when I found the replenishment mechanic, so it ought to be reworked (or just explained clearly).

You have to poke around the map to find cities. It's not clear if there's a construction limit to the number of different things you can build in a city, so planning is hopeless. I only got one regiment of archers and couldn't train more, so it felt a bit silly that the entire Roman army could only fire a few arrows per battle, assuming the battle even involved that one archer regiment.

The AI puts units among trees, so your enemy has an artificial advantage because your camera view being blocked by the trees isn't something that stops AI from micromanaging its own units. There's so few points on the campaign map that units can stand on that it gets cluttered. Sometimes you can't move a unit where you want without having to collide with another, making unwanted interaction menus come up.

The new graphics are pretty flat - not really appealing, and not charming like the original. There's quality of life issues like not being able to sort battle statistics by regiment kills, unit cards not being arranged by type, and the savegames being hidden in C:\Users\name\AppData\Local\Feral Interactive\Total War ROME REMASTERED\VFS\Local\Rome

[b]Things they should have changed[/b]
You can't play naval battles. Trade isn't explained or shown in any depth, even in negotiation windows. The training queue doesn't show how many turns all the regiments will be ready by. Troops like Hastati are so slow to throw their missiles that they often get attacked without doing it. Cavalry often charge into friendly soldiers. I couldn't see any option for a multiplayer campaign.

Nearly all the achievements are nonsense and have cringey names. The amount of friendly fire is shocking, forcing you have to constantly babysit your ranged units. There's a bizarre change from spacebar to right click to speed up campaign animations, and you can't toggle it off, so every time you want to move something you have to left click, then right click. I can't find an option to lower the campaign map scroll speed which is frustratingly high.

Rebels randomly spawn for no reason and do nothing, and can disappear (rebellions can be fun if implemented well). Clicking on an enemy army to attack it on the campaign map sometimes just sends your army somewhere else. It's difficult to tell how much ammunition a regiment has at a glance, which was not a problem in the original.

In [i]Empire[/i] when AI tried to break a siege they'd just trigger a battle but then do nothing. If [i]you[/i] try to break a siege in this game then the AI still does nothing. No matter which of the two you point to as having the fault, they should have fixed it. Potentially you can just go up to them and shoot them with archers (if the game let you train any), and they still won't do anything.

[b]Glitches[/b]
Ranged units fire arrows after [i]fire at will[/i] is toggled off. Units can take up formations you didn't pick. I got night battle achievements despite the battle happening in daylight. Only 2 of 120 soldiers might actually fight when ordered to attack, but awkwardly the whole regiment gets ""exhausted"" by that. To move a few feet forward sometimes units often go on a long diversion during siege battles, which makes their journey longer and often causes them to unintentionally bump into the enemy getting themselves killed - wasting the interactivity of the game.

[b]Positive changes[/b]
It was nice to have a visualisation of the ranged units range, and for the game to be made with 16:9 screens in mind. 

[b]Summary[/b]
For £24.99 I think it's terrible value considering all they really did was add a sloppy coat of paint to the original. They should have put some effort in, especially if they wanted people to pre-order it and outrageously then release it in a broken state. But their lack of care isn't surprising after they left previous titles in a bad way (like [i]Empire Total War[/i] with gamebreaking memory leaks). These kind of shoddy remakes often feel like cashgrabs that just split the playerbase if anything.",1622893613,1622894008,False,6,1,0.53659820556640625,0,True,False,False

To be fair, Rome: Total War is a fantastic game. Or it was, back in the day. I must have logged hundreds if not thousands of hours, both on Steam and long before I was on this platform. I'd say I know the game fairly well. 

So let's begin with the good: Read any reviews for the original game and know you're getting a timeless classic, a watershed title that was a pioneer of a movement in the genre that breathed new life back into it. Even though it wasn't new to what Creative Assembly had been doing, the original game was an icon and raised CA to new heights. 
A remaster is surely worthwhile on the basic principle that it's an updated, ""pain-free"" experience. 

On the one positive hand, it's that awesome game now matching 16:9 ratio, modern resolutions, with updated textures, etc...
And as the cherry on top, they've implemented new gameplay features, such as Merchants, but even better: they made it optional, so traditionalists and nostalgia-seekers can go for exactly the type of experience they had over a decade ago, while others may enjoy what the new features have to offer. The best of both worlds!
Also on the aesthetic side there's a few impressive little details, such as the ethnicity of your unit's soldiers changing according to the geographical position of the settlement where you recruited them from; or the fact that now every individual soldier has their own unique appearances. 

Some other elements, such as the UI design and the difficulty balance have been both praised and criticized, although I found them positive points, personally. 

On the other hand, this re-release is fraught with bugs, insta-crashes, performance issues and errors. 
Some indicate very little time and resources spent on quality assurance, or otherwise betray the rushed nature of this remaster project, like the AI pathfinding being worse than it was back in 2004. 
Others are more annoying, like the game crashing at the end of each turn, or even just as you scroll through the campaign map. 
What's more, some are rather obscure to figure out and quite a rare sight coming from anything more than an indie game made as a hobby/exercise by a person or two, like the game insta-crashing if you happen to have a dual-screen set-up, apparently. 
A month later, first major patch supposed to make the game playable for much of the affected player-base, and a new wave of confusion, frustration, disappointment and anger as a whole new section of the customers now experience major graphical issues and new forms of crashing the game. 

And finally, we get to ugly part. 
You may be wondering how I can share these insights even though I have merely logged a few dozen minutes at the time of this review. I happened to spend 4 or 5 hours with the game on a friend's PC, and otherwise, those few dozens of minutes represent hundreds of attempts at running the game only to insta-crash, crash shortly after selecting this game on the unnecessary game launcher, or other similar effects. 

I purchased the game a few days after release, for logistic reasons, but made the decision to buy it prior to release, when the game specs ambiguously required ""A 64-bit processor and OS,"" thinking I matched the other minimum specs and, technically, the vague description. 
Surely a mistake on my part for not double checking after release, and for thinking I could expect for games that run on Windows 7, 8 or 10 to run on all three of them. It's certainly true for the more recent Creative Assembly games (Rome 2, Attila, Three Kingdoms, etc), and hundreds of Steam games I own. In fact, the only game I know of that is Windows 10 exclusive is Microsoft's own Sea of Thieves, and I know it by chance because I don't own the game. 
But I can concede that the mistake is mine. 

However, even though Creative Assembly is hardly a stranger to release issues, I don't think I had ever seen such an appaling management of what turned out to be a problem not only for me, but a sizable amount of the series' fans. 
The community has largely been met with silence, indifference, and a hostile push for refunds. 
How a company in this industry -- let alone 3 -- gives a shrug or a middle finger to their adepts in 2021 is astonishing, but also the apparent strategy to deal with fan criticism. 


In retrospect, an industry legend handing down the remaster to their flagship title (a watershed game, I emphasize), including the Windows version, to a company that prides itself on making ports for Apple OS, should have indicated the priority was more likely to be churning out a spontaneous cash-grab they could delegate, as opposed to pleasing their long-term customers and making a classic accessible to a newer generation of gamers.
Then again, recent products have also established a tendency towards releasing a broken game with the intention to treat it more or less as a service only to drop it prematurely in favor of another similar project. 

Hopefully one day they'll reconsider and make a patch to allow these other technically viable operating systems to run the game.

I've logged many hours on disc and Steam versions of these games and to see this piece of my childhood remastered was a dream come true. Its the same game, but with better graphics all around and a few quality of life changes. Many people instantly down voted because of the UI, which for a while, almost detracted me from buying it until I saw a YouTube video showing how intuitive and easy it actually is. You honestly get used to it rather quickly and you can change the scale of it. If anything, it gives you more control options and more screen space to see the battle with. There are a few addons to the game, like merchants, but nothing that detracts too much from the original. There are some things I'd like changed however. Overall though, its a solid improvement over the original and I've only had like two crashes.

Pros
- Better graphics and graphics options
- An extreme unit scale (as an example, a 160 man cohort is now 200)
- Merchants that work like Medieval 2
- Multiple textures for soldiers within a unit (aka, they don't all look the same)
- More control options in a battle
- A very well put together battle and campaign camera
- Quality of life changes that can be toggled off before a campaign starts
- The event organizer lets you keep notifications so you can see them again later
- More graphs and stats for you to see in campaign
- An easy ancillary trade menu

Neutral
- Some of the default options are kind of odd, like run being toggled on for all units. You can turn this off on the right side of the UI menu during a battle. Make sure you change these options to your liking first, and adjust them here and there as needed.

Cons
- The pictures that come with notifications both in battle and on the battle map are too small, so you can't admire the artwork anymore
- Sieges can be a little wonky, especially with larger unit sizes. Don't rush too many units through one opening at once and make sure you are drag moving your units into place within the narrow streets.
- The loading screens are meh
- The new main menu screen isn't as good as the old one

I can't stress how good this remaster is even with the minor flaws. Don't listen to all the haters. If you loved the original, get it. If you love the Total War franchise, but never played the older ones because of the graphics, get it. The devs did a great job of making a faithful remaster with just enough additions and changes to keep it the same, but make it modern.

Yes there are bugs (siege towers opening painfully slowly, units getting scattered and hard to control especially in sieges, both campaign and battle AI making ridiculous mistakes even on hard difficulty) and crashes.

As someone who put around 100 hours into the original Rome Total War, and has been playing the franchise for over ten years, I was extremely excited when this came out. It was the game by which the franchise truly took off. After playing it, I can tell you this Remaster is exactly the original Rome Total War with amplified graphics and quality of life improvements such as menus where you can see all of your armies and agents. It also has a new UI, which in my opinion isn't good, but not something to keep you from buying. It additionally comes with all the DLCs, making a large amount of content available.

If you were an original Total War player that enjoyed Rome Total War, or are deeply interested in the period, I'd say buy it. For anyone else, I'd say wait until it goes on sale for $15 or less. Why is that? Well like I said, this is essentially the core Rome Total War game with only graphical and quality of life improvements, like new menus. The original Rome Total War, while amazing for its time, had many issues, and in this Remaster these issues aren't fixed. The nightmares of high population and squalor, horrific path-finding in sieges, and very limited unit rosters for less relevant nations such as Spain are but a few of these. While there is definitely room to argue that they should keep the game as close to the original as possible, these are issues which hinder the player that are fixed in every Total War game past 2004, and yet are still present in this remake in 2021. 

Ultimately, the TLDR of this is that there are many other Total War games which are better to spend your money on over this because they failed to improve upon the 2004 version's issues. Unless you are a fan of the original game, I'd skip this one unless it is on sale.

Take over Europe, Northern Africa, and the middle east as one of three available Roman factions, or take up arms against the Roman as almost every faction in the game!


PROS:

~For $30 ($15 if you bought it while owning Rome: Total War) This is definitely a bargain. You get the original game with all its DLC, AND the remaster with all its DLC. Its essentially 6 games in one

~The remaster isnt identical to the original. There are a lot of additions and quality of life changes, such as the addition of merchants, limit on squalor penalty, and the ability to remove the leaves from trees. Of course, you can disable ALL of them for the original but with better graphics

~There is proper workshop support, which is much easier than trying to install mods yourself, and the mods available as of this review completely change the game already

~I hear people complain about the vibrancy of the graphics, but you can change the graphics to more realistic graphics, so thats a problem solved

~You can play just about every faction from barbarian invasion and the original rome total war (apart from the rebels and the S.P.Q.R) which adds a lot more fun opportunities and gameplays

~There are a FEW new soundtracks, which is nice and adds a bit of difference in the music.


CONS:

~I've noticed that, for Barbarian invasion especially, the game crashes quite often if you play as a faction that wasn't originally available (at least when I played the Celts)

~There are a lot of assets that are completely unchanged, mainly the pictures with events. I would love at least a re-rendering of those in the style of the game itself

~Some of the new available factions have not really been made to be played. In my gameplay of Spain, a new available faction, there was only 5 infantry units (only 1 heavy), 2 ranged units, and 2 cavalry. I feel like it would be cool to at least give some of the new available factions units from other nearby factions, or make some of the mercenary units official units

~The AI for cavalry, I feel, is more broken than the game. The number of times my general just stood there while the rest of his unit ran was quite often.


OVERALL: 8.5/10

This is, in my opinion, the definitive version of Rome: Total War. Any problems will either be patched or fixed by the steam workshop. I would certainly prefer the remaster over the original purely on new additions and bug fixes, and if you prefer the original version, this remaster pack comes with the original. There is essentially no reason not to buy this if you want Rome: Total War apart from an extra $10-15 or so for a better version of the game.",1622484046,1622484046,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

To start, I am an avid fan of Roman History and the original Rome Total War, having gotten a minor in history cause of games like the original Rome Total War. But the issues in the remaster are just far to glaring to recommend to anyone. 

First issue is they made the original game unavailable for purchase, if you are trying to sell a remaster on its own merits that is an extremely odd choice and not a good sign.

Second Issue is definitely the UI and AI, as many others have commented it’s quite abysmal in the remaster. In certain areas the have made improvements in the battles including the AI finally realizing to withdraw from non favourable battles which I do not recall in the original. However I also don’t remember having major delays in ordering troops in the original, while in the remaster I see every battle now. Kinda hard to take initiative when it takes your units 15 seconds to act on your orders.

The third issue is in unit balance, I can’t believe I have to mention this section, but jeez the remaster is just god awful at calculating certain units damage. The phalanx’s are broken behind reason, played multiple games where Heavy Cavalry charging into the back of an enemy phalanx made me lost the whole unit. The front makes sense to be suicide the back is just bizarre, especially since the original did not have that issue. Same goes for spearman that are not phalanxes such as Triarii and Libyan Spearmen. They should not be mowed doses by light Calvary, yet that happened to me repeatedly.

The last issue is with the achievements they added into the remastering. I have no complaints with them including the achievements, except half of them are broken. I couldn’t earn a short and long campaign achievement for a nation in the same run. The religion achievements in Barbarian Invasion are completely unobtainable, since I tried converting the world on multiple campaigns owning 90% of the world with no achievement. 

At the end of the day, if you want to play a game like Rome Total war since you can’t buy the original, play medieval 2 total war. All the magic at 1/4 the cost.

TLDR: the remaster UI is buggy, units can die in fights that make no sense to lose, achievements are bugged and you should buy Medieval 2 Total war instead.",1622423887,1622426686,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

(I WAS THE TYPE WHO NEVER PLAYED THE 'MAIN FACTION' IN ROME 2 OR ATTILA  SO I NEVER PLAYED AS A ROMAN OR EASTERN FACTION.)

The legacy game that has been held above all others is understandably the best total war of all, it is like no other total war, forcing you to battle every battle in very hard, whilst adapting to each faction's strategy type while you defend and conquer. (unless you just stack onto them.) But it's so dam good. At turn 150 and I just started to push back into Gaul again after deciding to rush them the first 20 turns in, then being bombarded by Spain, Gaul, and Brits, then Dacia and Macedon leaving me no other choice but having to retreat back into Italy while dismantling every held city outside of the alps as I went back. I decided to wait it out, build my army's infrastructure and as I did the senate outlawed me, I had a strong northern border so it was time to focus on the south, conquered Italy, and pushed the Bruttii out and into Greece, while demolishing the Scipii in the south. Now I'm in a 3 pronged conquest, taking Greece with 1 army, pushing into Gaul/ Spain with two armies, and now fighting Carthage and Numidia in the south... While the Brits and Dacia continue bouncing of my Northern border. I can understand a lot better now why the Roman empire expanded how it did and why the Eastern Empire heavily focused on a lot of bows and a strong front line due to adapting to fighting against the steppe's whereas the West is more cavalry and infantry focused... Fun game. It's the first time playing Rome 1 .. yet I've been a fan of this series for over 10 years, started with medieval 2, then shogun 2, and Rome 2, over 500 hrs in Attila but I never really got into Warhammer... Thus i stopped playing Total war all together, im so glad i bought the remaster even though its not what people where expecting from such a hyped remaster as it deems more respect. (This is just a glorified graphics overhaul with a new UI and a few unfamiliar features added.) Yet the game itself clearly shines through and continues to uphold its huge legacy as it's brought back a lost fanatic into the fray as it originally introduced the fandom to the series long ago.

I am really disappointed. 

Bad Side: 
-Sadly, the UI is really bad. I dont understand why the developer abandon the good old control and well designed UI in the old Rome Total War.
-Again the UI, why hide information like city income from the campaign map ? Return to the old UI would be best
-The battle map graphic is really bad, it feels very cartoonish instead of realistic. Even medieval 2 feels better than this.
-The battle camera is not smooth, especially when you try to turn your camera left and right.
-The units are not really reacting good to order. For instance, archer takes a while to shoot and skrimish mode is not working, they are just waiting for the enemy to charge at them instead of skrimishing. (I understand that old RTW have this problem as well, but it should be fixed in 2021 remastered.)
-The battle animations are real bad, this is not up the standard of 2021.
-The battle feels too quick to end. 
-In campaign map, why ""left click"" to fast forward ? Why not spacebar? like the old game.
-Why remove the ""News popup""? Now every news like adoption just hide insignificantly at the left top corner.
-Why is the troops and building icon in campaign city details looks so small now? Return the old UI please.


Good Side
-The campaign map graphic is good, but less cartoonish would be much better, make it more realistic.

I am uninstalling this. 
Might revisit this in near future and hopefully they fix all the cons above.

If not, I might reconsider twice before purchasing any other remastered product in future.

The remaster makes it run really smoothly on modern machines and look significantly better than the original, which is great.
The flip side of the coin is however that path-finding became worse than the original RTW and everything else that is ""new"" is either not actually new (with the exception of the emergent Ostrogoth, Slavic and Romano-British factions the ""new"" factions could actually rather easily be enabled in the old RTW and they still have the lack of unit diversity that probably was the reason they were disabled by default in the original) or do not actually add anything to the game (merchants).
A common complaint I've seen elsewhere is the UI. I don't really agree with this, because although I do regret that it is so different, taking away from the nostalgia hit, one can get used to it (at least I could). It does not, however, renew the gameplay in any way.
Fundamentally it is still the Rome Total War from 2004. The new lick of paint is nice, and the game is great for its time. I did get two nice nostalgia-inducing campaigns out of it, that I did enjoy, one in the regular campaign and one in Barbarian Invasion. However, since then, I have not felt much motivation to do another one. While I can't rule out an occasional return for a nostalgia hit, I can't say I think this is worth the €15 price tag. For a new player who has not seen all the ins and outs of the original, there is likely a lot more playtime to be extracted from it still. Unfortunately, that means the price is doubled because you will not have owned the original (and as I understand it, this will be for everyone after the 31st of May, also veterans), which I would again judge to not be worth it for a game this old (by a long shot). If you buy the game in a sale I would judge €8-10 to be a fair price for what it is.
I would have recommended trying the original and then judging whether the graphics and performance are worth the extra expense to buy the remastered version. Unfortunately, the original is only available tied to the remastered version, an admission of weakness in my view as it shows that the developer does not want their new version to compete with the original, even if it became possible again, it would likely not come with a reduction in price to make up for your purchase of the original.
In conclusion, unless the remastered game is discounted to below €10, I would unfortunately not recommend Rome Remastered to veterans or new players alike. If they were to make a Medieval II remake now, I would not buy it unless the game was significantly cheaper than this one.",1622299657,1622299657,False,1,0,0.515329122543334961,0,True,False,False

In 17 years, nothing positive has been added except a slightly changed new trade system no one asked for, small balancing changes and better AI and graphics (although compared to the games of today they are very average graphics and AI). Instead of an improved Rome Total War, this game is a couple unnoticeable mechanics and a terrible UI system better than the original. 

Aside from the actual game, there are plenty of performance issues, such as the game crashing as soon as a campaign or battle begins. Multiplayer is unmanageable because of this. Speaking of multiplayer, nothing has been added on that front either. Multiplayer campaigns have not been added either. 

The UI is easily the worst part of this game. Notifications are now in sections instead of just being in a list and have been crammed into about a 1/16th of the screen making them very hard to read when you have more than 4 or 5. They also removed the nice scrolls you get in the centre of your screen to read the notification in depth, so now the Civil War event, the scientific breakthrough flavour text and other important events are simply afterthoughts. In my Brutii campaign, it took me two turns to realise that I had been outlawed because the single notification was buried in ""DIPLOMAT HAS BEEN IDLE FOR 3 TURNS"" and ""PATH BLOCKED"".

Which sucks because anything related to producing any kind of game requires grueling amount of work and effort by many people involved, which compounds the disappointed us fans feel in receiving a bad product and having to put out a negative review.  

Instead of producing either an inspired updated game with lots of love for the original or at least a 1-for-1 update to a modern systems; we get an ugly, uninspired, foggy remembrance of RTW. Resulting in just a cheap knock-off that makes you wanting more.

The new look(s) of the game are (at least to my eyes) abysmal and tonally clashing. The U.I. is objectively worse at communicating vital information which the original did better. The game runs smoothly but is hard to look at and seems blurry; It actually feels a little like the Warscape engine which the rest of the games from ETW and on run on. The audio cues seem off and out of sync, and I am not sure but the speeches seem rerecorded producing a less effective impact then they used to.

I personally don't like the changes they made in design. Here a list:

Disappointments:
- Campaign UI. Is built in a modular way; things are smaller than before, harder too read and you have to open these extended modules to build units or buildings. Sounds similar to the old Rome? Well its not. Before, when you wanted to build or recruit, you opened a scroll that filled half the screen. This means that this is now your task. But in remastered it only fills a tiny module in the middle right. So now this just feels like an irritating block on your map, where buildings and units are hard to read because everything is so small. It's just...you want you old UI back
- Battle UI. This is not as dramatic as the campaign UI but it is still worse than the old UI. Whether or not a unit is firing is harder to see than before, unit pictures are harder to see than before and I really just want the old UI back
- Campaign map has changed visually. What used to be smooth and relaxing light brown with gradients to green, gray and yellow (easy on the eyes) is now an aggressive green-yellow. Add that to the UI and the campaign map is a place you don't want to be in anymore.
- main theme (black silhouettes on pure red) is gone ; there is a mod that brings it back (though it lacks a little for me). Just, why change that? It was really iconic, set a tone and many remember it to this day...
- loading screens are changed to some environment with one person in the foreground (there are several such screens). Feels like a middle finger in my face...maybe a mod fixes that too at some point

Glad they kept it:
- units are as colorful as they used to be (but graphically updated), making it easy to distinguish them in the battle field. This can be turned off with an option for those that want it a little more realistic. Good job :)
- these weird air animations for arrows, spears and such can be turned off, so it looks just like it used to. Thanks for the option :)
- music is still the same :)

Other changes (non-design):
- they introduced Merchants...they are fine
- good mod integration

If you have played R:TW previously and liked it, then for 15 € I would recommend buying this. 

I wouldn't say this edition is superior to the original version, however with the mod support this version has a great future ahead. Unfortunately the old version is barely playable on modern systems, so it's not really a choice anymore. They have cut a small amount of content for the remaster and there are new flaws while some of the old ones still remain which is a shame. Although at it's core it's still the old R:TW and one of the best Total War games ever created.

The most important thing is that it runs great, although using MSAA seems to drop frames (at least on linux) quite drastically so I don't use it. Otherwise I can max out the all settings (high unit size).

On the other hand it does crash a LOT. I have the linux version.

Something I noticed quite quickly was that the pathfinding is outright worse in some situations (especially in cities) and units are not as responsive. The units have trouble keeping in formation while in cities which can be frustrating.

Campaign UI is different, and I have mixed feelings about it. There are some nice quality of life improvements, but I especially miss the old system of news and alerts. In the new UI there are a lot of unnecessary clicks involved and many menus that seem pointless. However a lot of the information is actually clearly presented and easy to read. It seems like some pop ups that required you to hover your mouse on something have been removed (there are some rumours that this remaster was based on a few years old mobile port which would explain said differences in the campaign UI). Also the UI lets me see the actual army size in number of men from distant cities covered in fog of war which I don't think should happen...

Battle UI is also different, but the changes actually seem to be mostly beneficial. Some of the nice styling has been lost in the remastering but it would seem like the information about your units is more easily visible in a glance.

I don't like that they took the ""normal"" unit size as a base for balancing the game. It is just so unrealistically small in my opinion. One example of this is that if you recruit a unit, the population cost is the same as the count of men in the ""normal"" unit size setting, regardless of the unit size setting you're actually using in the campaign.

I read they removed some content that was in the original game like some videos, this absolutely shouldn't happen.

I have mixed feelings about the Campaign AI, they act weird diplomatically and are very hesitant to have ceasefire although being greatly underwhelmed. The way they move units in the campaign map seems okay. My enemy (the Gauls) had quite highly upgraded units in early part of the campaign which was surprising to see.

On average the battle AI is reasonable. It makes silly mistakes and feeds units every now and then (especially while defending cities). Something the AI does often is that it closes on your line and then retreats. The AI repeats this constantly which gives you easy targets for your ranged units. The original AI was never impressive so it's hard to compare them.",1619788716,1622149019,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There is a new patch and although there are still some minor things (like AI has no idea what to do when attacking FROM a sieged city and just draws after idling for few minutes), but overall this game is playable. Changing review to positive.

** EDIT **

After conquering half of Gaul and 1/3 of Germany I can say that this is not a terrible remaster. Campaign gameplay is well crafted, game is pretty, sound and music are great.

The reason why I'm giving this a negative review is the utterly broken formation / unit behavior system on the battlefield. This is especially visible during sieges, when you want to take advantage of a choke point. Your units do not follow the formation at all. You want them standing in a wide line? Look, they are forming a column. Want them to face a specific direction, to be prepered for enemy at different angle? Let's make them swap direction every 15 seconds, because apparently there are some units approaching from the angle that is already covered. Maybe that's because I've ordered my Hastati to use missles freely, but this behavior doesn't end after they use all of their ammo and is definitely not an excuse for my troops not listening of what formation I want them to be. If I wanted a long column I would order a long column!

Fix it please, otherwise it's solid remaster

Ach, if a dev is reading it by some miracle - usage of space button during battle was made almost useless due to the slowness of process.

I also feel like Total War is just going downhill since (except Shogun 2, but being an European, European history was always more exciting ), so I was very excited to have the opportunity to play it again. After trying both the normal campaign and BI, I have mixed feelings, to be said at least.

The good:
- Graphics is looking good
- With non-classical settings, diplomatic AI is incomparably better than original
- UI shows clearly which buildings cause cultural penalty, especially important in BI with Nomad, Hun and Barbarian all having the same buildings
- If ""end-turn"" movement path is blocked, you can actually give new orders to the affected army/agent
- Easier to follow construction report
- AI Roman factions are not that overwhelming as in the original (Egypt is the same as it was though)
- Battle UI is better with missile range and movement path shown.

The bad:
- ""Upgraded"" Campaign AI is passive, refuses to do anything offensive, while ""Classic"" Campaign AI is overly aggressive even with armies which clearly have no chance to do anything. This makes the game quite frustrating to play.
- Unit size is tied to graphic settings, cannot be set individually. This combined with the pathfinding bug with max unit size at settlements can make some WTF moments at sieges.
- Lock formation by default seems to not work in the Battle UI. It does not lock formation unless the units are grouped.

The wtf:
- Why did they change the order of options in the pre-battle UI? I ran away from battle a couple of times accidentally because it was in a different order in the original game, and I think in every Total War since.

Overall, it just feels like its incomplete. I do not recommend it in a way it is now, and especially not for full price. Maybe they will fix it, nothing looks unfixable from the bugs.",1622059455,1622059659,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I Was day 1 player Where i crashed twice, or first launch and then First starting jullii campaign. this was patched by the sunday.its only crashes i had. Whilst few days after it release the game Still have broken mutiplayer, and dysnc issues, ive holded off making review, as i saw many on 1.5 -20 hr reviews being of quick judgement.
Honestly this is great remaster, If you enjoyed any of historical titles you like this one, its closer to RTW/RTW2/ TWA/TOB/TWM2 very optimised for modern hardware, but dont expect it run on relic Pentium 1 half broken and taped back together  with potato forced into gpu slot in mayan cave using a car battery as power supply. You need at least Intel 4000's series/ Amd FX series with Nividia  GTX 1050ti Or AMD rtx470 To run this smoothly. Its modern graphics, i say its may be more demanding than rome 2. due how modern the lighting/post process effects and anti al . Yet it still feels older due the way its stylised in a way that gives it a retro vibe 
This is Solid 8, But my honest thoughts are Mods will make vinalla game An Vinalla + Expreince and fix many aspects of the game Feral interactive failed to do.Vinalla as it is Contains 2 dlc BI and ATG campaigns, Both Fleshed out, remasterd and Great amount of content. Barbarian invasion plays almost identical to its successor  Total War Attila. Alexander the great Is full war of Conquesting the Known world with its war against persia, the greek tharcian and Hellenic tribes and within the late stages india.
And for anyone wondering the file size is 24.1gb, but it may be closer to 24.5gb after the patches (Without 4K texture pack that is)

The pro's: 
Steam workshop support for plenty free mods Every tw should have this
Battles feel great, and more balanced than ever before ,cav has more of punch with shock cav, And heavily armoured cav feel more arrow proof than ever. The AI has been GREATLY improved to not run in circles, Now they more aggresive, actaully use flanking tactics, and usaully target archers, light inf, or alone units with there cav/ and flanking units what makes battles all the more harder, i struggle on medium sometimes, whilst i could abuse the mechanics and AI alot easier on Very hard on orginal RTW. it nice to the great improvements, In sieges archers will be placed on walls , and inf supporting them in a way that player setting them up would be making it alot more challenging to take a settlement.
Auto battle is more balanced. and more favourable to the player.
Great remaster
Add alot life to game with new unit models for Base game and all its dlc, closer to historical accuracy (tw never been accurate 100% more around 75% margin with some Fantasy elements) 
Adds new rextextures and models to everything, grass is no longer Just flat 240p texture Now its actaully is 3d model, with 1080p/4k texture underneath it. I can tell alot work when into rextexturing.
Optinal choice between remasterd settings and Classic
Towns look far,many of the buildings, remodeled, alot more clutter, street crubs, drains, all the little things that make it more immserive to plants, tree's gardens ,and city view mode (For those who may not know  it was way veiw citys any time you want with one click away on battle map, this can now be done pressing the spy glass on selttement twice )
there a  better with mod that can more variety in civilians.
All units play look so much better. Even mud, snow, dirt,dampness gets on clothing/armour of the men in battle.
So many rebalances, its hard to list in review without cuttering it, more affordable unit balances, Elephants arent tanks, Phalanxes are bit weaker,  Archers can do more damage and have range varation instead all stuck at 150m.
The UI, is FAR more modern, 20 year diffrence for many this is Negative, or a con. But personally i love it. if your use to rome 2/attila or any of newer titles and liked there UI you should like this one. 
Modern hotkeys & modern controls/camera pan



Cons:
Old janky animations men with the units still move robotically as they run, repeated animation or wheels or carts/chariots and siege equipment animations still very dated
still has aged like milk Pathfinding thats at its worst in city small streets.
No cutscenes or new cutscenes added for Barbarian invasion   and Alexander the Great, The dlc feel like they got alot less attention tbh. Compared to Vinalla RTW, they dont feel as touch, more so With ATG campaign. and its historical battles
They stayed too much true to the Orginal in many ways, Saxons in BI could benefited with some German units to balance it more than its limited 8 unit roster. or Tharcia should have more greek units etc in the vinalla, Or eygpt could Be more Greek  infulenced are period correct like in Rome 2. Yet the eygptians here are bronze age in a iron age period, totally misfitting.
They could added more Mercanies altogether. Like Addition to hire more than 4 kinds Roman Mercs with barbarian invasion, Foedratti inf/cav, And Veterania Cav/ Inf (Like roman Equites and  roman Cohorts equivalent  but veterans) 
Citys in barbarian invasion could do with complete Reskin seperate to main game, the fact that Rome is 200-400 year old buildings, and still looks brand new , not spick of dirt on the place. is immersion breaking. Small gripe, but Barbarian invasion Compared to Its spiritual successor is sub par, they had opportunity  to make Roman cities look more distressed, ruined, i bet modders may do this with rextexturing later on, but it be alot work, as there is alot models.
No blood or Gore animations. Another case of staying True to the original game, i suspect this possible through mods, or may be DLC later.
No ship battles, same again staying too true to the original BUT some already done this a mod (doesnt work in campaign yet)
In ATG greece is still horribly misshapen and not geographically accurate, It doesnt even resemble The vinalla game greece whats 90% accurate in terms of geography.
Unit variety in some factions such a gauls is still dated ,they stayed true to orginal yet again, But gauls may have variety of 20 haircuts 20 beards, 5 trousers, And mutiple shields, they still dont wear shirts, or Helmets, i would like to see it been more modernised. I was the creative direction that seems to have wanted to stay true to orginal as much as possible that time and time again hinders the game.
They could added more settlements on the Campaign map in general, But this could be remasterd option , totally optinal if you preferred RTW original map, the Audience asked for it, On discord and steam forums, Many times, and usaully quite popular. This did not happen, Yet again staying true to orginal, what im unsure of, More settlements may unbalanced the game, Or ruin the acradey feel. But Modders have added more locations/settlements 
The wonders no longer show a cutscene, I like to have seen New cutscenes rather than just more detailed text box. The disc is more interesting/ info but i like to see more of the game remasterd.
No CO-OP with a friend, due to engines age.
Dysnc issues in MTP PVP, you the host has to press 'resume battle' if someone dysyncs (Lags out) And we all have to wait till the host does this, THIS should be automatic like in TW or generally all modern MTP games. Why keep the orignal broken Resume buttons??
This usaully means if lets say host dies in 2v2 or 4v4 or 6 v 6 etc and goes afk you can be waiting as long he gone in match for him to resume, whilst you wait for him to press resume, THEN you all have to play, many people in pvp seem to be braindead or Simply missing a brain  and dont read the chat or look at it, or seem to not know how to read english saying 'Press normal speed you are paused we want to contiue to match' and 'PRESS THE NORMAL SPEED BUTTON!!!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

It's a solid ""No"" from me just with an hour of playtime. The first hour pretty much says how this game is going to be. I love the original Rome Total War, the first Total War game that I played, even though it has a lot of faults and buggy mechanics. I've played it for hundreds of hours, more than any other Total War game. I was hoping that this game would be an improvement over the original but it's not. It is an improvement over the graphics and nothing else. Everything else is even more broken than the original.

The UI is atrocious and worse than the original, though I can get used to it. The worst part is the buggy and broken units and AI.  In my first battle in Segesta, I asked the velites (javelin units) to fire at the enemy Barbarian Peasants. Instead of stopping and firing, the idiots ran right into the enemy and suffered casualties as a result. The hastati units also mostly don't bother using their pilums when you ask them to attack. They just run right at the enemy and engage in melee combat. The units also sometimes refuse to respond to attack commands and just sit in one place unless I right-click repeatedly and even when they move, they were blocked by some building and refused to try going around it. This basic thing worked fine in the original Rome Total War released so many years ago. It baffles me how CA could make a remastered version even more broken than the old original.

Running is now the default mode instead of walking. I couldn't find an option to turn that off. In the original game, it used to be single right-click for walk and double right-click to run but now units run by default so whenever I give a move command I have to also make sure to switch the unit back to walk mode since I don't want them to run all the time and become tired.

Creative Assembly have changed nothing in their base mechanics since Rome Total War. Every Total War game since Rome Total War has the same broken mechanics and bugs and frustrations. They are so lazy that they have just reused the base code for the past 2 decades and just added a different skin to each game and selling it for $60. I am sick of their laziness and attitude of SEGA which keeps selling pathetic DLCs which contain ""features"" that barely add anything and should have been part of the base game anyway. 

I'm not going to waste my money on another Total War game.

I upgraded a PC for the first time to be able to run the original at better than lowest settings. Ah, the lag was worth it. Times have certainly changed since then, I tell you. The rich, deep political intrigue of Total War present is absent, in Rome you are presented with hectic and shaky alliances. You will be betrayed, and you will face some important defeats if you are not prepared. Different factions present different play-styles, from encouraging you to poke things with sharp sticks, to peppering with arrows - making a swift and sound retreat. There's a lot to do with (almost) every faction here, and it is heaps of fun.

The remaster adds a bunch of quality of life improvements, which makes the lack of changing glaring flaws much, much more noticeable. Sometimes, it is hard to go backwards in time, and return to the way things were. Total War: Rome Remastered can be a lot to digest, especially if you haven't picked up the original in awhile. That said, you can basically revert this INTO the original game with many changeable interfaces. Whether or not this is your first time playing an older Total War title (much less such a fan favorite as this), or you're just getting that 50% off and already owned the original, I consider this to be one of the pleasant highlights of my year. I don't give much care about the multiplayer, but in a short time I've managed to swashbuckle my way to victory with the Scipii, and force a return to the days of Alexander the Great under the unified Greek Cities.

885970,92515457,76561198023036277,0,12,9089,0,565,1697542528,"Background: I am a huge fan of the original Rome Total war to the point where I had played it a substantial amount in 2021 before the remaster came out, and have only played 10 hours or so of the remaster as of writing this so these are my first impressions. 

Positives: In general I am really pleased that this remaster has been done as the original game had such solid game play in most respects and so even just a graphical update and stability improvement on modern systems is very welcome. There are also some good quality of life improvements (such as squalor cap, slave distribution not depending on governors etc.) and I like some of the added features like the map overlay and range finders in battle etc.

Negatives: Unfortunately some corners have been cut in that not all the content of the original is here (missing wonder and expansion intro videos etc.) and some obvious ways to improve such as improving the stupid and exploitable AI (the main downfall of the original game imo), adding a multiplayer campaign or  fleshing out the previously unplayable faction rosters (or their general's speeches to be akin to the specificity of the roman ones) have as a rule not been taken. Given that there have been corners cut it is a shame that some of what has had effort put in has been marred by awful decisions: most notably the UI has been completely overhauled and is good in some ways but some aspects of it are simply inexcusable and worse than the original (e.g. building/unit pictures and font sizes are tiny and only just about tolerable even after maxing out the UI size option). There are generally just too many clicks required to see what you want to see and many important things are hidden away as if they were minor: Tax rates for settlements are buried in the ""details"" whereas I would argue that should be adjustable up front and centre; Unit descriptions are hidden behind multiple clicks which really discourages learning about the historical parallels; worst of all is agents actions. 
If I spy on an enemy character the result used to come up clearly (the information they found followed by a success failure message) whereas now you have to dig into the reports to see what happened (one to see success/failure, a separate one to see any trait increases) and dig into the character/city info with 2 or 3 clicks to see the information you've learned. It's not hugely arduous but just much more involved than it has any good reason to be. 
Also for me load times are really bad (circa five mins to load a campaign) and I've had two crashes but my laptop is 5 years old so I'm somewhat willing to take some of the blame. Still, it is a shame that it doesn't actually run smoother than the original for me.

Conclusion: In general, for half price I'd recommend getting this as it is a nice facelift for what is an absolute classic. I hope they do this for other historical total wars (eg. Medieval 2) and am glad CA has shown some interest in its back catalogue. I am disappointed it isn't better as it could easily have been and it is marred by some truly daft choices (*cough* UI design) and corner cutting in general (why they didn't just give themselves more time to do it better I don't know). That said, I will play it over the original and assume it will only improve with patching. For now 7/10 for me.",1621854797,1621854797,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

885970,92453119,76561199058887519,0,77,68,0,30,1621754597,"When I initially heard the news that Rome Total War was experiencing a remaster, one that would be virtually identical, albeit with a few graphical changes, I whooped with delight, reminiscencing upon the fond memories of my youth, where I engaged in the game on Gamespy Arcade on disc. The initial elation that I felt however, gradually turned to a mixture of dread and bafflement, as videos detailing the game, alongside unsavoury reviews dampened my expectations. Out of pure curiosity, coupled in with nostalgia, I decided to indulge myself and purchase the game for my Steam birthday and by the Gods, what has this insidious company done. Creative Destruction has accomplished the inconceivable. They have stumbled upon a block of gold in the salt lakes of Arizona and instead of selling  the invaluable metal, or converting it into jewelry, they have decided to cave a child’s skull in with the gold block, smear fecal matter onto it and hurl it into the ocean, where it will inevitably either sink into the deep sea caverns, or be swallowed by an amphibious creature, that will be apprehended by south east Asian fishermen and sold to the black market. Essentially, this company has turned from a noble monarch, to a demented jester, one that parades about the halls in tattered rags, flirting with children and regaling his previous valour. 

To describe the extent of my disappointment, would be akin to explaining my distaste of the English, it is lengthy, fanatical and causes my vision to turn a scarlet red. Despite, this I will attempt to regale my tale of woe to all. Upon entering the game, I was astonished, utterly bewildered by the horrors that terrorized my eyes. To call these blobs of light that sear my retina, ‘visuals’, would be parallel to referring to urine as ‘mouthwash’. I mean, excuse the profanity, but what utter poppycock is this? After 17 years of technological adaptations since 2004, not only have has Creative Assembly inexplicably managed to worsen the graphics, but they have somehow sapped the very life and charm from the game, polymorphing what was distinctive and unique, into a banal and vapid garbage dump that even the most unimaginative, petulant brat would have difficulty worsening. How did you accomplish this Creative Assembly? The 2004 version was brimming with charm, various characters of unique professions such as assassins, spies, diplomats and generals littered the map, each turn belayed a distinct surprise and there was a genuine sense of wonder when traversing the map. I fondly recall venturing deep into the forests of Russia, dedicating several years to sieging the remote province of Themiskyra and slaughtering the Amazons, only to then engage in a series of lengthy conflicts, as rebels frequently attempted to usurp my rule. Nowadays, I load up the remaster and feel naught but disappoint, as I’m forced to observe a map that looks reminiscent of an elaborate board game, with the units appearing to emulate toy soldiers. 

Furthermore, the newfound aesthetic appears to have coined inspiration from Imperator Rome, with the UI, general interface and main menu being nigh identical. Asides from the blatant theft of other games designs, the general layout is utterly peculiar. I generally utilize light mode; when on my computer and even despite this fact, everything appears brighter than the bloody sun. This is especially apparent when text appears on the screen. For some unknown reason, it was decided that the text should appear as a bright white, luminescent glow, a colour which I now realise is frequently difficult to discern, irrespective of the background. Creative Assembly, I would like to formally state that I am not a moth, I do not become captivated by shiny, luminescent lights, nor do I enjoy being temporarily blinded everytime I glance at this malignant contraption. Furthermore, there is the matter of the ‘art’ that appears on every loading screen. The ‘art’ in question is in my experience, either a Nubian man, who appears to have been molded out of clay by a braindead 14 year old, or a Germanic warlord, jubilantly opening his arms wide and appearing to have been drawn by a child, suffering from a severe stroke and heavily requiring medical assistance. Creative Assembly, while I’m positive that 14 year old Salmir draws well for a special needs child, you don’t have to incessantly cram his creations down my gullet after every battle. Initially, upon glancing at the characters in the loading screen I was relatively neutral, but now I harbour resentment to anything resembling a clay model and wish to throttle whatever disability support station you acquired that artist from. 

Asides from the visuals, I must broach upon the text that graces my loading screen. Now, in the initial game, you would oft be greeted by a distinctive phrase, quoted by a historical text or figure during the era, however, the developers decided that an educational quote wouldn’t suit the main demographics of the remaster, which are majorly comprised of highschool dropouts. Instead of a quote related to tactics, or general philosophy, the text now states, “If your offer is very generous, then they are more likely to accept” or, “When starting out as a Roman, it may be prudent to appeal to the senate”. After receiving such quotes, that rival even that of William Wallaces battle rousing’s and Kaiser Wilhelm’s speeches, I feel robbed. It is as though an armed man, donned with a balaclava and Hello Kitty suit has entered my home, stolen my wallet and then dissatisfied by his haul, has decided to beat the ever living daylights out of me. Do you hear that Creative Assembly? You have not just robbed my entity, but you have severely beaten me with a cudgel.

As a conclusion to the genuine gameplay, I wish to state that there is an untold multitude of distasteful features I encountered and will inevitably have failed to reference in this review. For instance, the lack of indication that units are being assaulted, forests inexplicably failing to conceal units and most significantly the ludicrous level of micromanaging and UI, that appears to draw immense influence from mobile phone games are significant maladaptation’s for the game. Overall, in regards to the gameplay and aesthetic, it is as though a lunatic felt compelled to take the worst aspects of a strategy mobile game and port them over to computer, for the sheer motive of observing anger and vitriol from the frequently vitriolic playerbase. 

In regards to the players who parrot away, claiming that this is an extraordinary game, I wonder if they are capable of completing a child’s puzzle without adult supervision, for their reviews belay a lack of sentience and cognitive ability, making me dubious of their ability to write a coherent review, let alone adequately judge this embodiment of all things sinister. I have observed reviewers claim that this is the ‘best’ game in the series and that they have ‘struggled’ with previous total games, for their supposed complexity. This further reinforces my adamant belief that this game was manufactured to placate the intellectually disabled and further broaden the games availability for all intelligences Steam wide. Now, onto the dubious marketing tactics.",1621753854,1621786322,False,51,17,0.546138107776641846,6,True,False,False

The UI feels like it was ported from a bad mobile game (in fact I prefer the old one much more). 

The pathfinding frequently gets your units stuck in cities to a point city battles are annoying. 

Phalanxes are broken, cavalry charges into the back of a phalanx has the units suddenly turn around - with the same phalanxes untouched from the cavalry charge. And speaking of cavalry charges, they're not as powerful as they were in old Rome. 

Confusing Battle AI decisions across the board (it takes you out of the game, what even are formations?) To elaborate the AI breaks its own formation to a point you can send a few cavalry units and kill the entire enemy army while the bugged pathfinding tries to sort itself out. 

Confusing Campaign AI decisions - the AI will send 6 javelin units to a fortified city, or a lone general unit will siege a city with walls.

Diplomacy is a meme, but it was in the old one so they get a pass on this one.

Audio issues across the board, music clipping and certain sounds not playing in combat, etc. For instance the Barbarian Warband has a sound you can hear from afar when they start to run/walk. Roman Melee units appear to not play any of these sounds. There's also an absence of actual fighting sounds and instances where one side will play their fighting sounds, the other won't.

All in all a very disappointing remaster without a patch one month after release.

I speak with some authority when it comes to the mechanics in these games. This review however isn't directed at new players, but experienced, returning total war fans. I have played the Remaster for only 10 hours, and I have already encountered game breaking problems that make it impossible for me to take the game seriously, whether in Campaign or in Multiplayer.

The primary issue is with how they coded the physics for battles on top of the existing engine. They have thoroughly and irreparably messed up the fluidity of combat. Particularly, phalanges have been affected the most by this, becoming totally impotent, nearly to the level of Rome 2, a fact which I'm sure everyone who played that game is intimately aware of. The problems are fundamental, they lie in how the path-finding, unit cohesion, and unit reforming work. The result is that this is no longer Rome: Total War, but some sort of bastard child resembling Rome 1, but playing like Rome 2.

Case in point, the Multiplayer community has already moved back to the original. On launch day there were 10 lobbies concurrently. Only a few days later there were no more than 2, which is the same number as on Rome, a game released in 2004.

What enrages me the most isn't how totally they have ruined one of my favorite games of all time, but that they've done so while taking away the right to buy the original. We will no longer have new Rome: Total War players. We will only have new Total War: Rome Remastered players, who in all likelihood will never even realize they're buying the superior, original games as part of a bundle for $30 alongside it, or if they do, they will think them inferior, graphically or otherwise. The better game will die in obscurity. Rome managed to survive for nearly 20 years having been left alone by Creative Assembly. Anything CA (and by extension their partner Feral Interactive) touches, turns into a pile of dogshit.

If you own Rome, do not buy.
If you don't own Rome, then wait for a sale and buy, as it's not worth $30, but don't play the Remaster. Simply purchase to play the original.
If you want to play the original game remastered, no such thing exists. Only a poor imitation of it.

""Alas, the pains I bear are numberless—my people now all sick with plague, our minds can find no weapons to serve as our defense against the Creative Assembly's butchering of our favorite game. Now the offspring of our splendid franchise no longer grow, nor do our women crying out in labor get their relief from a living new installment in the series. As you can see—one by one they swoop away, off to the shores of the evening god, like birds faster than fire which no one can resist.
Our strategy franchise dies—we’ve lost count of all the dead. Her sons lie in the dirt unpitied, unlamented. Corpses spread the pestilence, while youthful wives and grey-haired mothers on the altar stepswail everywhere and cry in supplication, seeking to relieve their agonizing pain. Their solemn chants ring out—they mingle with the voices of lament. Zeus’ golden daughter, send your support and strength, your lovely countenance AND STRIKE DOWN THE CREATIVE ASSEMBLY!""

Everything about it has charm, whether it's the music, cheesy voice overs, or the city viewer. It really was a marvel of a game for its time.

That's why I got really excited when news about the remaster came out. It looked promising enough, and it was a chance to relive one of the classics. Unfortunately it seems that I have been spoiled by very high quality remasters like Homeworld, Command and Conquer, and Metro 2033, because in my opinion, Rome Remastered falls short of that level of quality. 

Rome Remastered is not a bad game, the original game play is still there, but it not has aged very well. There are major pathing issues that seem to have been made worse by the update, the UI seems to have been downgraded as well, and there are basically no QoL upgrades. The only real upgrade are the graphics, and even that does not look as good as the trailers. Overall the game is a bit disappointing. 

As much as it pains me to say this, I do not recommend the game at full price. Even with the 50% discount for Rome Total War owners, I still do not recommend it. I would say wait until it drops to $10 or even $5, because that is the price I would feel comfortable paying for what is essentially a graphics mod of the original. My recommendation is to wait until a price drop or skip it entirely unless you are a huge Rome Total War fan, in which case this is the game for you.

-My first interaction with them a few turns in: I have the starting 80 reputation, i'm not at war with them. Currently midway sniping Parthia. I offer trade rights and map information in exchange for map information.
-their response: ""give us map information and 500 denarii or we will attack."" i accept, getting trade rights in a seperate deal.

-next turn: Selucids have allied Parthia.

-Selucids park an army or 2 within my border, abuse compensation system to get free money out of them for trespassing. This goes on for a while, funding my remaining campaign against Parthia.

-give Selucids Susa in exchange for an alliance (after having them reject it a few times because i offered them military access as a bonus). They accept, breaking their other alliance with Parthia. End up GIFTING military access to them since they wont accept it any other way.

-Selucids leave my land and march south to battle egypt, actually capturing some terretory. Meanwhile im preparing to invade Pontus whilst going through the torture of beating back Sythia, giddy that ive actually made a friend in a total war game, they actually fixed the diplomacy!

-a few turns later, midway through invading pontus, random Selucid diplomat appears. Breaks alliance and military access.

-next turn Selucids have allied Pontus.

-abuse compensation some more, selucids give me terretory, i give it back in exchange for an alliance...

-look up how to keep an ally in this game, decide to offer selucids 300g tribute for the next 500 turns.

-this keeps them off my back long enough for me to kill Pontus and begin fighting Greek cities. Until one day i decide to update map information, causing them to automatically break the alliance upon me sending the offer.

-am busy fighting Greeks, hoping the tribute will still keep the Selucids docile... they litterally bring all of their forces out of egypt and swarm my terretory.

-getting irritated, seeing an opportunity to cap one of their cities easily i attack premtively.

-take the city, offer it back to them for a ceasefire and alliance. End up needing to add a pile of money for them to accept. Gift military access yet again...

-start helping them fight egypt, they take more land.

-a few turns later they attack me, breaking the alliance and beseiging one of my cities.

- next turn Selucids have declared a ceasefire with Egypt. I prepare a full scale invasion of the selucids, thinking the only way im going to hold onto this alliance is if i forcefully subjugate them.

-next turn Selucids have declared an ALLIANCE with Egypt.

-spend the next dozen or so turns RAZING SELUCID CITIES AND DESTROYING THEIR MILITARY INFASTRUCTURE.

-GET THE SELUCIDS DOWN TO ONE CITY, demand they become my protectorate, OFFER THEM LITTERALY EVER CITY I OWN, MY ENTIRE TREASURY AND MAKING SURE I DONT OFFER FUCKING MILITARY ACCESS. litterally will not accept under any circumstances. IN FACT THE ONLY WAY I COULD EVEN GET THEM TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IS BY ABUSING THE GODAMM COMPENSATION SYSTEM AND ASKING THEM TO PAY ME.

The main problem with this game is that the modern games have improved on it so much. It's a good remaster - people need to chill out about the UI - and I'm content with my $15 investment. I don't expect to play it much or often, but I'm thankful to have it.

But, THIS IS NOT THE GAME TO TRY TOTAL WAR FOR THE FIRST TIME. Honestly, I'm not sure anyone who never played the original should bother with this when some of the sequels are so much better. If you want to see what Total War is all about, pick-up Shogun 2, Empire, or Warhammer II.

I am saying this as both a long-time Total War fan and someone intimately familiar with the original Rome: Total War and its expansion.

Right now this is a Remaster in name only and the only thing improved from the original are the graphics. Everything else from pathfinding, tactical and diplomatic AI, and the UI are abysmally bad if not outright broken especially compared to the older game, which while janky, are serviceable; the remaster amplifies the existing jank and kicks it up to 11.

There are so many issues I don't know where to begin. In my brief campaign as the Julii, one of the Roman factions, my faction family members failed to have children and adoptees died instantly (due to an oversight with the way the game handles event notifications). The enemy AI is even more schizophrenic than the original, declaring war a turn after suing for peace, or harassing your cities with tiny armies of one or two units then running away when you challenge them.

Units will pour out of an gate or opening like brain-damaged lemmings running back and forth in a mosh pit of confusion until the entire unit clears the opening. While the original did have a certain level of jank with pathing these issues are exacerbated by the Remaster.

The UI is atrocious with tiny icons and nested formation options that sprout even smaller icons. Text is small even at 1080p and difficult to read; the new notification system removes a lot of the anticipation of the original system as they slid down the screen and in its stead is a three-tiered news widget that feels like something designed for mobile screens.

I finally gave up when the game started crashing on me.

There was absolutely no reason for Feral to rush this remaster out the door (in retrospect it was probably the looming WH3 announcement that caused them to rush). On paper this Remaster should have been a slam dunk that improved on the original (which, while a classic, has not aged well graphically or mechanically) but instead actually delivers a poorer experience. The small improvements don't compensate for the myriad issues and three weeks out from release and Feral has yet to update the game to address the bugs.

The biggest complaint I have is the UI. It's pretty clear it's a mobile UI taken from the mobile ports. Not ideal and nowhere near the most efficient use of a modern monitor, but it's hardly unusable. There's a bunch of nice things about it and a bunch of steps back. Some information is easier to find, others are more buried. After a few hours in a campaign you'll be pretty used to it. I'd say ultimately it's a wash.

Second biggest complaint I have is it still crashes a bit too much for my liking. It shouldn't crash at all TBH so any crash is worse than none. I believe I crashed about 3 times in a 30 hour campaign playthrough. Mostly in late game. Not ideal, certainly a hit against it.

Other than that, this is Rome Total War for better or worse. Pathfinding of units isn't great, never was. The auto resolve is absolutely terrible just like it used to be. The factions outside of Rome are pretty underdeveloped, just like it always was. The small changes Feral made that can be toggled on and off aren't that game changing in the end. Honestly, it's been so long since I've played a campaign in Rome Total War I've not noticed a difference but I'm sure there's a few (outside of the inclusion of Medieval 2 style resources and merchants).

I guess what I'm getting at is this is basically exactly what I expect for a remaster. It's got a nice new coat of paint, adapts to modern resolutions, has the modern Total War control scheme, and is generally exactly what Rome Total War is.

I'm not a fan of knocking a remaster for flaws in the original game. At what point does fixing those flaws end up making it into a different game? We have Rome 2 which is in a fine state these days if you want something more modern. If I had to choose to do a remake, I'd not stray from the original much like Feral did with this port. The good and the bad of Rome Total War is here for better or worse. Either you dig that or you skip it.

This version of the game is worse than the original title (how is that even possible?). In order to be honest and fair, lets make a list of the improvements, the declines, and what I was expecting from this title.

Improvements
- Better graphics (expected this at the least)
- Range of missiles are shown, and many battle options can be fiddled with (I appreciate the run-always option)
- Unit balancing (haven't noticed a difference from original game yet)

Declines
- UI is tiny and has a weird lag to it (my turns take 5-10 more minutes because the campaign map's buttons and menus are atrocious)
- Random glitches (Rome civil war at turn 10, frozen end turns)

Expectations
- Better unit pathing (cavalry will YOLO into pikes when you tell them to turn anything more than 45 degrees, missile troops confuse skirmish mode with charge-on-sight mode)
- No bugs (the word 'remaster' implies that you've already mastered the game. How do you go in the opposite direction?)
- Fleshing out the other factions to make them more viable
- Adapting to more modern Total War games (this is a biased point. I hate single-unit recruiting and constructing only one building at a time. Also, army stances would be an interesting aspect to throw in).
- Proper mod support at launch

Positives:
- The game is graphically an improvement.
- Brings the game closer to what is expected of more modern titles.
- Nice soundtrack.

Negatives:
- Bugs.
- Ugly UI.
- Unresponsive units make the game genuinely a chore to play a battle.

At the end of the day, they profit on your nostalgia. The game is like the the high school girlfriend you see after many years. Good old times, still beautiful, fond memories but there's a reason you actually broke up in the first place.

[b]Edit (after a few more hours playing the game):[/b]

- The new UI is a huge disadvantage. It feels off, like it was made for a mobile device. Important things are hidden in tabs behind other tabs which are opened with clicks over clicks over clicks. At first, you can ​somewhat ignore it but as the game progresses it becomes all the more tiring.

- Game crashes sometimes on Win10 with my graphics card driver updated (and admin rights). At least there's a crash manager though.

- A few bugs can be spotted. Like invisible NPCs  etc.

- AI must have hidden bonuses, a common tactic used  in TW games which becomes apparent after a few turns sending deathstacks  upon deathstacks with no visible repercussions on their economy. That's no AI though",1621342178,1621496848,False,0,0,0.507462680339813232,0,True,False,False

Maybe I'm just used to the origianal, but the UI seems more convoluted, especially with agents (just let me right click a target for my assassin, not choose a mission from a dropdown in the corner of the screen). At least diplomats can still right click on their targets. The family tree is still there, but not an actual graphical tree which I liked from the original. The diplomacy seems better, but I don't understand what influences reputation (why do I only have 70 when I've never broken any treaties?), and the AI still does counterintuitive stuff (if my relationship with parthia is 100, why don't they want an alliance? I suspect it's because I'm at war with their ally, but in that case WHY is our relationship at 100??). I've also noticed a bug where it only shows half your holdings in the Territorial Ranking graph.

The good stuff: I love the strategic campaign map view, but I'm a sucker for maps. Visuals are much improved, and while that's to be expected (and perhaps not quite as improved as they really should be 15 years later), it runs MUCH smoother on my machine than the original ever did even with the better graphics. Battle and campaign AI is still lacking but much better than before, and I love that you gave options for remaster balance/feature changes or to keep the original stuff.

[b]== The Good ==[/b]
The unit models look great. They are improved versions of the originals, the devs didn't go overboard trying to make it look like a different game, just a prettier version of the one we love. 

The remaster is more moddable and stable on some peoples' machines. I've had no issues, though I can tell that's a mixed bag depending on your machine.

[b]== The Bad ==[/b]
Pathfinding feels worse, considerably worse, especially with skirmisher units. 

The campaign map is hard to look at, both because of the new terrain color palette and the minimap; the faction map colors are changed and can be hard to differentiate. 

[b]And then here's the big one...[/b] The choices made for the UI are absolutely atrocious. The original UI was perfectly serviceable but the remaster made it worse in every single way. Some units have near identical cards (Pontic light/heavy cavalry), and every action requires more mouse clicks to accomplish. 
-Building structures is harder. 
-Training units is harder. 
-Using agents is harder. 
-Managing settlement finances is harder, you can't even see settlement income without opening a menu.
Every single change made to the UI was for the worse. As is, it's useable with some adjustment but very unenjoyable and totally unnecessary.

I've played the Brutii campaign to completion, including conquering the whole map and played a couple of other factions for a few hours and here's how I've found it:

Pros:
- Looks and performs great. Feels exactly what you'd expect from an upscale of the original game. Not had a single crash in over 35 hours playing, which was my biggest issue with the original game on steam. Nothing worse than finishing a battle only for the game to crash before you can save. Not been an issue once for me here.
- Optional AI and Gameplay tweaks - quite a few good additions such as improved AI, economic & diplomacy systems etc, but if you want the full classic experience they can all be turned off.
- Workshop support, already seeing some of the major classic RTW mods being ported to this version, can see this being a major plus to the longevity of this version as more mods are ported or added. 
- Music and voice overs are the same as they always were. My only gripe with the AOE2 remaster is that they redid the voice acting for the campaigns, making them more realistic but much less characterful. The general's speeches and narrator were great in RTW so very happy they've stayed the same. The soundtrack has always been stellar and is as good as it ever was.
- Previously non-playable factions all unlock-able and playable now (Macedon, Numidia, Spain etc). You could always unlock them by editing a text file in the original but they are all built to work now, except SPQR but mods can do that if you want it. In Barbarian Invasion there are even a couple of emerging factions you can play such as the Romano British, which is completely new to my knowledge.

Cons
- Only really the one thing I don't like that much. As with most people I'm not a big fan of the new campaign map UI, but you get used to it. I'm surprised there hasn't been a workshop mod already but I suspect one will come sooner or later if its really unbearable, but its not a massive issue to me.",1621441255,1621441525,True,9,0,0.591552734375,0,True,False,False

The game itself is faithful to the original in almost every aspect, the addition of the merchant system was a welcome expansion, especially when in early game, where everyone around you on very hard has the capability to make 1-3 death stacks before you even expand beyond your first rebel settlement. 

The game, almost ironically, runs better than the original on modern hardware. There is huge optimization (i can run the game ultra-maxed out without any real issue) and like other Total War games, it is mostly CPU limited. unlike the recent releases by CA (im looking at you Rome II,) the game doesn't have any real game-breaking issues. The game itself works almost flawlessly, and when there are issues in the game, they are either small CTDs, (which honestly have only happened when i had games where my side, and the enemies had 100+ units,) the occasional graphical glitch (invisible soldiers) and other issues that I had no issue with. 

It reminds me greatly of the time when my first real GPU was a MX440 and i upgraded to the 5500FX (more like downgraded imo) to play this original game and the original Call of Duty. It is both a faithful remake and one that greatly expands on the original content in a realistic way.

Pros:
Horse Archers 
Great revitalization of the Graphics
Optimization
Not a usual release of CA
Discount of 50% when owning the original
A faithful remake of a classic

Cons:
Some small bugs, Graphical Glitches, Etc.
Wish they added support for multiple units on the walls
Also wish they added the ability for archers to stand opposite of the battlements so that they could shoot down at the enemy below, once you take the settlement walls.
AI tends to get Assassin/spy heavy in the higher difficulties.

- The new UI is horrid. It is absolutely impractical in on any computer and it somehow gives you LESS information in four times as many pop-up windows and sliders. It is actually amazing, how they managed to screw this so badly. Orientation in it is definitely not natural. Yep, information is there... but you need to hold Alt to see part of it, and the other part is hidden on the other side of the screen - it's simply all over the place. Not mentioning the sizing ""option"" problems - it either takes up half of the screen, or it's too small to read the text and numbers (on decently sized screen).
- In some regards, it looks worse than some mods of Medieval II - 15yo game.
- Auto detection is simply bad. It changed everything into the lowest graphic settings - had to change it to ultra, did not experience one lag.
- AI is incredibly dumb in every regard - diplomacy, campaign map, battles. It is esential part of the game and it doesn't work properly.
- It is bugged. I did not see too many myself, but i couldn't tell if some are bugs, oversights or just needs tweaks. E.g. attacking pallisade, I couldn't capture wooden towers. Period. They just kept shooting, all of them. Pretty fast, may I add, destroying 2 out of 4 rams with ease, before they could even get to the walls.  Another thing are merchants - I buy out a rival. Don't get any money. Should I get some? Do they go to the merchant? Who knows? Is it a bug, is it a feature? The information isn't there.

Considering all of this, I cannot recommend the Remaster as of yet. It is a nice feeling to play it again - but don't pay the full price, not before they fix and tweak at least the most terrible stuff. They should film less cringe videos and make more updates instead.",1621296146,1621296146,False,4,0,0.524582862854003906,0,True,False,False

Not even Skyrim modding is that beginner friendly. These mods consist of improvements from helping the AI form-up in formations faster to expansive upgrades to Carthage, Egypt, and Macedon's unit rosters.

Playing as Saxons, just getting started into the game and have 2 cities therefore i have a weak economy, but my Faction leader breeds like a rat so now i'm paying 2600 Denari a turn into general upkeep with no way to dispand/stop paying for them, so my economy is crippled.

My Merchant (1 per city) brings in 9 denari per turn, therefore i would need 288+ Merchants/cities to balance the funds for my general units... i think that's about 3x the amount of cities in the game.

Also Heavy cavalry will win in a 1v1 melee against spear troops now with minor casualties.

Will try again with no mods, and I also noted no option to enable / disable different mods when launching game.. also noted that some mods definately didn't activate. I should have option to choose which mods to enable/disable each time I boot the game, and to see which have conflicts. Game takes about 3-4 times to start, and to load battles compared to the old RTW which I have running smoothly (I just have to avoid trying to alt+tab out of the game otherwise no problems). Also noted generally poorly responsive units in battles. I am not hugely impressed so far, even with the 50% discount... seems mostly cosmetic changes to game and too many changes to UI that wasn't exactly a problem before ... doesn't seem as user friendly in some ways, but other ways I think are small improvements. Hopefully game will run better as community fixes the game, and expand the content with mods.

UPDATE - even with no mods, launcher is buggy and slow. Mod manager completly non functional. Game very slow to start up and on each loading screen. In battles units are less responsive somehow.

Now on to the good things. The units look amazing especially the Celtic factions. Playing against the AI is more fun and interesting even though some of their actions are still questionable. The new campaign map looks cool although would look nicer if it was a little darker but still nice.

You get to play as different empires and civilizations akin to a 4x (Civilization Series) game with the difference being that Total War games focus more on the domination aspect. In my opinion, all the games I've played in this series lives up to the satisfying feeling of taking over worlds from the Napoleonic wars to the Sengoku Jidai.
One game which I wanted to play was Rome Total War but there were some technical issues that I have faced which prevented me from experiencing it. To my surprise, CA announced Rome Remastered which peeked my interest given that I could finally play it.
So I come to this game as a new player, and for what it is, its good. This is the heart of OG Total War and I quite enjoyed my time conquering many parts of Europe. The game has problems however. Ive experienced the game locking up on the campaign map forcing me to close it. The path finding is questionable especially in sieges where units will usually take the longest routes to get to a point in the settlement. The AI on the campaign map will just leave bunch of units hanging around the last settlement just watching while not being able to engage because they are not in the range of the settlement.

Graphics update is nice, and really nice to know they've kept a lot of original art/music so it retains the original feel. I didn't manage to get to using merchants, but they sound like an interesting addition (I'm requesting a refund and hit 90 mins playtime).


However, unit pathfinding in battles is so horrendously bad during a siege they will go a route triple the length of distance than you can clearly see by eye that they should use. Same issue when trying to attack units during a siege (if they're near capture point). I know pathfinding was not brilliant in the original, but I genuinely think somehow they made it worse... Some control changes too (I know it's from newer TW titles) like auto-run when right clicking, and other changes make it more clunky to try and walk your units into positions. Locked formations seem nice, provided you aren't going into enclosed siege spaces.

Equally, the UI is very different and not intuitive/easy like in the original. Finding tax for settlements requires more than simply clicking on the settlement -- now you have to go into multiple other pages. Same issue for construction, recruitment, etc. Other reviews say after 50 hours it's still a pain in the a$$.

I know it's only a one-off, but was recommended to the tutorial as ""new things not on other TW games"", but nothing I was shown/taught was new. And it was a clunky tutorial where you were waiting for timers before you could complete actions it asked you to do (like if it asked you to move units to a location, you have to wait 5 seconds before making the order...) -- i get that it's a one-off, but highlights problems with polish/finish that playtesting should have quickly identified.


It's a real shame because some of the balance/bugfix features and ideas they implement are nice, but I honestly will probably go and play the original RTW rather than this clunky version.",1621090870,1621090870,False,16,0,0.580970942974090576,0,True,False,False

The main benefit is the updated UI, which (despite complaints to the contrary) is a clear improvement over the old. It's so much easier to transfer retinue, for one, and visualizing the stats of your generals is a lot easier. I feel like I can so much better manage my units and leaders because of these improvements. Obviously, it takes a bit of time to get used to the new UI, but most of the complaints I've seen are clearly too beholden to nostalgia and too affected by low playtime (I'd truly recommend [i] not [/i] listening to reviews based on half an hour of playtime).

My complaints about the remaster are a few, and they're mostly minor issues, like audio glitches or matters of aesthetics (the landscapes in battles looking rather bleak sometimes). However, the campaign map is lovely, though different from the old game. Dynamic shading makes things look nice, particularly after battles when the time of day on the campaign map changes.

I'll admit that the new merchant unit is rather confusing and doesn't seem to add much to the gameplay. I will also agree with other complaints about non-Roman factions not being able to advance beyond the rudiments of civilization—if the devs were comfortable adding new mechanics like the merchant, why not make this change too?

A final caveat is that some mechanics are newly clunky. This might just be my own incompetence, but I'm pretty sure that selecting a group of units and having them attack a single unit does not work: they instead will go after different enemy units. You have to select your individual units to give the correct attack orders, basically. Additionally, get used to not being able to use your general as a viable combat unit, at least not until the enemy is totally routing. Your general is no longer a tank and is just as mortal as everyone else in his unit, as I found out the hard way.

These minor quibbles aside, this is a solid remaster and is well worth the price, especially if you're getting the half-off discount. My hope is that minor glitches and issues will be fixed in the future, but as it stands now, the game is fun and a clear improvement over the classic [i] Rome: Total War[/i].",1621017043,1621017068,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Seriously this is the definitive version of Rome Total War, and if anyone says otherwise, I really do think they should take a second look. 

~The Good:~
It's a remastered Rome Total War, not remade. There is a huge difference between remaster and remake, and some people are taking this as a remake, when it just isn't. It uses the same original engine, most of the same code, just with a graphical refresh, and a much cleaner UI. Also with some heavy optimization in order to get the game to run really well on modern hardware as opposed to the Original.

The graphics are gorgeous, it's not as complex as the warhammer games, or really any game on the warscape engine (anything past Rome II), but I mean for what they could do on an engine that is 20 years old it looks amazing! Leagues better than the original. Especially with the 4k texture add on.

It has complete Steam workshop support, meaning full mod support and Feral has stated that they unlocked the faction limit in the campaign map, and they unlocked the files for the campaign map. Meaning this is easily the most moddable total war to date, and that alone adds nearly an endless amount of hours to the game. I personally cannot wait for Lord of the Rings mods, Warhammer mods, and Medieval mods for this game!

I could go on and on about how Rome Total War is the best total war game, but this is simply a review of how they did with the remaster, and I think they overall did an amazing job making the best total war game playable again, with amazing graphics, a much better UI, and with modern total war controls. I can't praise Feral's job enough, they really did a great job bringing this game back to life.

~The Bad :~
It isn't perfect, some of the UI isn't that well thought out, but it is leagues better than the original, things are clearer, make more sense, and just overall better. Especially the Battle UI. It does take some getting used too, but IMOP it's better than the original UI by a landslide.

The path finding and AI are very slightly improved, if at all. But let's be honest I wasn't expecting a complete overhaul of the AI or path finding, it a remaster after all, done by a much smaller studio than CA's total war dev team. (The path finding and AI are basically the same as base game, and for me I really don't think its a big deal, the AI on very hard still gives quite the challenge, even with it's mistakes that you won't see in the newer total war games)

However I do have to say, compared with other TW games, the Siege AI is pretty bad. Even on very hard they do the same things and usually have a pattern to them. Still fun, just sieges are not the strong suit of this game.

I have heard a lot about bugs, I haven't encountered any, but could be a problem for others.

~Overall:~
This is a wonderful remaster. It is simply Rome Total War, with wonderful graphics, a new UI, much needed new controls, and it runs at a glorious 60+ frames per second. Yes there are some issues with bugs for some people, and yes some of the UI is not that well thought out. But I think Feral did an absolutely amazing job bringing the best total war game back to life with proper mod support.

After about 60 hours of play, I've finished the Julii long campaign and a short campaign with my beloved Dacia, I can say a few things about this game, so here it is:

At this stage, I would not recomend buying this as it doesn't offer too much over the original. 

Ups:
-better graphic (duh!)
- merchants from Medieval II
- 5% better diplomacy, and I'm being generous
- moving retinue members
and that's about it. 

Downs:
- the UI is soooo convoluted and counter-intuitive, I have to check in 5 places, open 10 submenus to find out 1 damn thing. It's horrible. When I had more than 20 provinces, to go through them was a nightmare. The whole overlay is bad, with little options, that stupid menu with details about characters that raises, has a tiny X mark that you have to aim for. From this perspective, the original UI was lightyears ahead
- merchants, they're nice but they took away the nicest part, getting moneys when you take over other faction's merchants. Also, the percentages are bogus, 50% of the time I lose takeovers with 95% chance. 
- same stupid way the family members get traits and retinue (drunken uncle and crap like that keeps showing up)
- still 5 buildings you can build in barbarian villages. Honestly, with this horrible UI no one will play long campaings with barbarians, I'm sick and tired of conquer-sack-leave 5 units-move onto the next province strategy that was the only way you could play with Dacians, Gauls, Britons, Spain etc. 
- not to mention pathfinding and the AI which is still the same since 2004. and it was bad back then 
- the fact that during battles when I move my army during battles they all align instead of keeping their relative position. if there's an option to fix this in the game, I haven't found it. 


Overall, it's a good game because it's Rome, but it's bad because not many issues were fixed and on top of that they fucked up the UI so baaad. Horrible to browse through. 

Oh... and the crashes, oh man, the crashes, it just freezes and I have to hard restart the PC.

Some of that is because of the remastered stuff and some of that is because the original Rome is a very old game and comes from a time when Total War games were different. I think, for the most part, that's a good thing, but everybody will have a different opinion on this.  I do enjoy most Total War games but the original Rome has always been my favorite. It took some time for me to get accustomed to the new interface of the remaster but once I did I still like the game quite a bit and still consider it to be my favorite.

The graphics are very nice in the remaster although they won't compete with some of the newer Total War games in this regard. The new interface isn't perfect but once I got used to it I have to say it works well enough for me. I like the overall clean look the game now sports. I love hearing the general's speeches again. The game also runs really well on my 2017 27 inch iMac. 

The existence of this remastered version is a bit of a bonus for Mac users because the original stop functioning with the release of Mac OS Catalina and the 64-bit requirement. So this remastered version brings it back from the dead for Mac users and the improvements are a nice bonus.  It's also nice that both the Barbarian and Alexander expansions are included. The original Mac version did include the Barbarian expansion but did not include the Alexander expansion. I never got around to playing the Barbarian campaign, or the Alexander one as well, so now I have that option which is great.

If I had any criticisms for the remaster one would be that the text, while clean looking, is sometimes unnecessarily too small to read for aging eyes like mine. I imagine a mod will come along to fix this but it's still worth mentioning. And as many have commented on the AI is still kind of nonsensical on occasion. In particular I've occasionally found myself facing off with an enemy army that seems unwilling to advance towards me even though they are in range of my missile units. So I can just keep raining missiles down on them constantly without worrying about them charging towards me. Granted arrows don't seem to do a lot of damage anymore so it takes a long time to make any sort of impression but obviously something isn't quite right about this. Perhaps a patch will take care of this in the future?

Despite the few issues I would recommend Total War Rome Remastered to anybody who likes Total War games and/or is interested in the Roman Empire.

My biggest problem with the game is with recruiting. You can't recruit from the city's tab, only construct. If you press 5, the recruit hotkey, while in the cities tab, it'll forcefully take you to the armies tab, where it's also not possible to recruit either. The only way to recruit in several cities is manually clicking above them, and then pressing 5 and choosing the unit you want. It's very time-consuming and could've easily been avoided.

That being said, I did enjoy the game's UI. In the original, the best way to navigate through different units, including armies and agents, was by pressing the button '' [ ''. This hotkey is still present, but you can, through the armies tab, navigate better now, especially in the late game, where you'll have a lot of armies, and not forget an army or an agent existence for a lot of turns. 

About the pathfinding, there were also, in my humble opinion, improvements. By keeping pressing shift, I believe, you can delineate exactly where you want your unit to walk. Very useful. However, a lot of Youtubers were having issues with the behavior of units. I, myself, didn't in my already two playthroughs (Brutii and Spain), but that doesn't mean those issues don't exist. 

Also, I know why people are mad about the UI. It's still not possible to do things on the map while the UI is open, and that, in the same nature of the problem I said in the first paragraph, could've been very easily fixed, and it's an obvious problem for those that play the game, very time-consuming, unnecessary and exhausting in the late game. It is, alongside pathfinding, the most evident and famous problem in Rome Total War.  It is as if the devs weren't Total War Rome players, or didn't inform themselves about the game's problems. 

In my opinion, this game is a little more polished, but the most palpable problems, UI and pathfinding, remains, even with visible improvements.

For a final note. They could have overhauled Egypt's faction to not be bronze age looking anymore (a very irritating aspect of the game for those history-lovers out there. Myself, I don't mind that much, but I acknowledge the problem), and they could have overhauled the units' rooster of the now-playable factions (a positive point, you can play with all of the factions in the game, now), and the, say, marginal factions existent in the game. In this regard, keeping loyal to the original wasn't a good idea, as this was, quite frankly, stupid on the original game's part. Some factions don't have endgame units and buildings, some don't even have middlegame units. The replayability of the game falls down with the forgetfulness of those factions.

Meu maior problema com o jogo é o recrutamento. Você não pode recrutar na guia da cidade, apenas construir. Se você pressionar 5, a tecla de atalho de recrutamento, enquanto estiver na guia de cidades, ela o levará à força para a guia de exércitos, onde também não é possível recrutar. A única maneira de recrutar em várias cidades é clicar manualmente acima delas e, em seguida, pressionar 5 e escolher a unidade desejada. É muito demorado e poderia ser facilmente evitado.

Dito isto, gostei da IU do jogo. No original, a melhor maneira de navegar pelas diferentes unidades, incluindo exércitos e agentes, era pressionando o botão '' [ ''. Esta tecla de atalho ainda está presente, mas você pode, através da aba exércitos, navegar melhor agora, especialmente no final do jogo, onde você terá muitos exércitos, e não se esquecerá de um exército ou da existência de um agente por vários turnos.

Quanto ao pathfinding, também houve, na minha humilde opinião, melhorias. Ao manter a tecla shift pressionada, acredito, você pode delinear exatamente onde deseja que sua unidade caminhe. Muito útil. No entanto, muitos Youtubers estavam tendo problemas com o comportamento das unidades. Eu mesmo não o fiz nas minhas duas jogadas (Brutii e Espanha), mas isso não significa que essas questões não existam.

Além disso, sei por que as pessoas estão P da vida com a IU. Ainda não é possível fazer coisas no mapa enquanto a IU está aberta, e isso, da mesma natureza do problema que eu disse no primeiro parágrafo, poderia ter sido facilmente corrigido, e é um problema óbvio para aqueles que jogam o jogo, tornado-o muito demorado, desnecessário e exaustivo no final do jogo. É, junto com o pathfinding, o problema mais evidente e famoso na Rome Total War. É como se os desenvolvedores não fossem jogadores do Total War Rome, ou não se informassem sobre os problemas do jogo.

Na minha opinião, este jogo é um pouco mais polido, mas os problemas mais palpáveis, UI e pathfinding, permanecem, mesmo com melhorias visíveis.

Para uma nota final. Eles poderiam ter reformulado a facção do Egito para não parecer mais com a idade do bronze (um aspecto muito irritante do jogo para os amantes da história. Eu mesmo, não me importo muito, mas reconheço o problema), e eles poderiam ter remasterizado a lista das unidades das facções agora jogáveis ​​(um ponto positivo, você pode jogar com todas as facções no jogo, agora), e as, digamos, facções marginais existentes no jogo. A este respeito, manter-se fiel ao original não foi uma boa ideia, já que isso foi, francamente, estúpido da parte do jogo original. Algumas facções não possuem unidades e edifícios de final de jogo, algumas nem mesmo unidades de meio de jogo. A rejogabilidade do jogo cai com o esquecimento dessas facções.",1621006866,1621006866,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Graphics[/b]
- World map is made more cartoon ish, than realistic like the original. While it may look prettier from a distance, everything now just blend into eachother with the severe lack of details. No area can be considered cool, special or well made because of this.
- Battlefield and unit graphics are decent. Building and nature easily details sticks out as the best, while the units graphics is as you can expect. It doesn't take a lot to improve graphics from a 2004 game.
[u] Conclusion: Better than original[/u]

[b]UI[/b]
This is probably the biggest shortcoming of the game, it's so bad that I to this day prefer the original game.
- Literally nothing scales right in the UI... Text is way too small even when the UI takes up a lot of space, which isn't used at all. You'll end up with a headace cause you find your face inside the screen when you play.
- unit images are scaled so low you can barely see any details, menu's are hidden beneath menu's of menu's, information which was in-game is taken out and put into steam's wiki which breaks immersion, and some information is gone for good. The result of this is that recruitment, building and tax management now feels like a chore, and these are the things you'll do the most...
[u] Conclusion: Worse than the original[/u]

[b]Battles[/b]
- Unit pathfinding and AI is worse than is was. units now ""run"" on every order you give them instead of the original double click, so now you gotta click on the very small ""button"" for them to walk or learn the keybind for it. (I didn't expect them to improve it, but now it's worse)
- Units are not responsive at all, even the skirmish troops which was ""fixed"". Worst case was 20 sec for a idle infantry unit to move, while 5-10 secs isn't uncommon response time.
[u] Conclusion: Worse than the original[/u]

[b]AI[/b]
- Only difference I see is that the AI ""run"" with their units more often, which doesn't work out. Example: in a big city fight you can just camp your units at spawn, cause the AI will run from spawn to the base point. leaving them exhausted when they reach base, so they can't really fight.
[u] Conclusion: Too early to say[/u]

[b]Misc[/b]
- A lot of content and infomation is taken out, examples: Success chance for every agent interaction, World wonder animations, photos of children and women in family tree is, some world event animations is gone...
- Merchants a nice addition, adds more money in game which makes the game easier. Not really needed, nor does it adds much to the game. Probably bugged, as the Senate's only merchant goes wild killing all my merchant as julii.
- Diplomatic overhaul seems nice.

Don't ask me *why* they only have some of these options in the battle screen, but it's one of the number one complaints people have. (I literally just figured this out and it's game changing)

It will take some time to get used to, but a lot of the changes are positive

There's a lot of changes to the game set up and some are good, others are bad. Overall, there's a lot more information available from the base screens, but it can be very confusing if you're used to the old HUDs. Many things are changed for ease of access, but that also has the side effect of options being moved around.

I'm not going to go into all the positives, since it's mostly just a Rome Total War with more advanced menus and some other positive changes, but I do love the merchant system. They made profiting with merchants significantly easier (as opposed to Medieval II, where you need to stack them on an army on an ivory node to get decent profits). I also how they added in rebel merchants. It makes it so there's a constant flow of low tier merchants for your guys to eat to level up.

My major criticisms: 
The game takes forever and a half to load the first time I open the campaign map each time I run the game. After that, I can relatively quickly load saves and all, but the first time has load times that are about as bad as Empire. This could be for technical reasons on my end and it's not game breaking, but it is really annoying.

Minor criticisms: 
-Game does not show chance of agent success while hovering over a target. It does appear in a small box in the bottom right of the HUD, but I'd prefer it's on the pointer too. This is probably because it's meant for mobile, but it would be great if the PC version could have this changed
-Agent cap (for merchants at least) is by city. This means that if a merchant gets eaten by a hostile merchant, you need to go to the original city to recruit a new one. This is probably more balanced, but it's also kinda annoying to deal with. I'm not sure if this applies to just merchants or all agents.
-The load and save game options are on the same menu. This is more of a personal inconvenience, but I prefer having two separate menus. I abuse savescums to a stupid degree and this just makes savescumming slightly more intuitive, which hurts my smooth brain.

Neutral:
-Spies really don't fail missions anymore. Not really a positive or negative, just an interesting choice.

Strongly considering getting a refund. If no UI mods come up or the developers don't give us the option to use the legacy UI and put back missing sounds, I will refund this game.

Instead, look for the OG Rome Total War experience, but way, WAY better. 

This game keeps all the great parts about OG Rome Total War and improves upon them. For example, the graphics of the battlefield and campaign maps are WAY better than they were from the first game. Still, there's a tradeoff (predictably, slight lag). Also, the AI has been vastly improved. CPU can disband, retrain, and automerge units, and it plays much more aggressively, so it feels like you're up against an actual player. Additionally, many units have been balanced and revamped: including bezerkers! I pitted 12 bezerkers against 8 Urban Cohort in a multiplayer, and the bezerkers were crushed!

Oh yeah, did I mention that there's actual multiplayer?

Now that this game has gotten more attention, there's an online multiplayer feature where you can battle against other players in Custom or Historical Battles. It is SO FUN: I love actually going up against other generals. Sadly, it crashes on me sometimes and it's also kinda laggy (and there are a few bugs). But those will probably get patched soon. If you're going into a multiplayer match, some words of advice: people will often ban the use of artillery, elephants, and bezerkers. They'll also only allow a maximum of 6 cavalry and 2 horse archers. Also: Cretan Archers are OP. 


 This game also adds in a bunch of the  ""wouldn't it be great it we had THAT"" features that weren't in OG Rome Total War. For example: all factions are unlocked. Period. No file editing required. And yes, this applies to both Rome Total War and the Barbarian Invasion Expansion Pack. Also, there's an 'Ultra' setting for the graphics, and an 'Extreme' setting for unit size, so you could have a battle with tens of thousands of solders. They also added in merchants (from other Total War games like Medieval) to the game. 

Now, I don't want to oversell this game. There are a couple of flaws. For one, I often have to set graphics to the low setting because of the lag. Also the UI is way different. I've seen a lot of people complaining about it, but I got used to it after my first couple of hours of play. The multiplayer network needs to fixed a tiny bit, and you still can't do naval battles without autoresolve.

I don't understand so much of the backlash from the community. It is Rome from 2004 but with prettier graphics and merchants now. Sure the QOL changes and the new UI and touching up of the textures is lovely and all but it is just Rome. I can understand the outrage at the price (I owned the OG Rome so I got 50% off).

Yes there are a few things that were left out but we are talking the TW2 engine that I don't think was capable of co-op campaigns. All the improvements in later total War games have been mostly good and yes it would have been nice to have seen a few more improvements in Rome Remastered but the game is still amazing. I have always loved Rome and I get that this is Rome in name only as it looks completely different but the baseline of Rome is there. 

I really don't understand the backlash, maybe its at CA for not really using their marketing team to tell us what the game was. Instead we got Phil Wang cosplaying as a Roman and cooking videos as opposed to details on what this remaster was. Sure that's what the influencers are for but the influencers aren't the best way to advertise.

I still really enjoy this remaster though and I think it was long overdue which is probably more of the reason people are so needlessly upset, they've spent so long dreaming up what a Rome remaster would be that when it finally came the reality was just a bit disapppointing.

I rate it 7.5/10

+ The game looks beautiful
+ It's essentially Rome 2004
+ Runs really well on modern systems

- Its basically just Rome (and its DLC) with not much changed.

Really just got this game because of the potential to play my favorite old mods (Europa Barbarorum, 4th Age, etc) with updated graphics, thanks to this game's promised mod support. Cuts a lot of the bloat and cheese that new Total War games have and delivers most of the good stuff that RTW has that the newer titles lack. Also, if this is a success there might be a remastered Medieval II down the line. I don't expect updates that expand this game's breadth and scope to match Rome II, but there's enough interest in this game to expect mods to fill the gaps

PROS:
Campaign maps are beautiful
Unit models look good while still recognizable to old RTW players
Battle UI, controls and mechanics are improved from original RTW
Nostalgia factor - all the same music, units and factions you loved
You can play as emergent factions in BI now

CONS:
The new campaign UI and features don't add much of value - some of them are actually kind of annoying
Same historical inaccuracies and limitations from the base game - comes with the territory

Unfortunately it has the same weaknesses in terms of AI in battles as it had in 2004. Streets are a bit of a nightmare, enemy AI frequently ends up with their battalions breaking up somehow and walking really far spread apart, units run of walls to their death sometimes, cheering for killing a general while getting charged by a swarm of barbarians and refusing to react. 

In my opinion an AI rework should've been included in the scope, that's more important to enjoyability than graphics and performance improvements in my opinion.

 Even though I've been on steam for a while this is the first time i decided to do a review, so here it goes.
But first, I want to make it clear that this is a remaster. I didn't expect them to do anything beyond some optimization and an enhancement to the graphics, the fact that they added the merchants and a few balance changes (which can be disabled if you so wish) was a welcome surprise. I am pointing this out because some people had the idea that is is a remake, or a definitive edition or something a long those lines, and had the expectation that this was going to be modern take on the classic RTW1 experience with more added content and some core mechanics/engine changes, sort of like how Black Mesa was for Half-Life but this was never the case and never was advertised as such, anyway now on to the actual pros and cons :)

Pros:
- The optimization for current hardware is a god send, just the fact that i was able to playthrough without stutters and a 30 FPS cap is an absolute +
- Although this is a bit subjective, I personally had notice a slight improvement in the AI on the Campaign Map, as in they are attacking more and with relatively high number of troops I even had a few Siege Battles fought against 2 Different factions that came to each others help something that i don't really remember happening quite often in the original, but the Battle AI hasn't really changed that much.
- Achievements for some are a big deal but for others not so much, I see them as a pro because they are nice addition for those hardcore completionists and for the bragging rights.

Cons:
- The needless UI change is a change for the sake of change in my opinion, if the game came with the option of changing the UI back to the classic one, i wouldn't have felt the need to include it here as a con, but for some people this can be turn off and understandably so. Hopefuly the devs will include the option to enable the classic UI in the near future.
- There are quite a few issues that one can observe in this game, from relatively minor ones like auto function not working from time to time, especially with merchants, to classic path finding issues, to a game breaking one where the game will stop on a faction during the end turn sequence thus making the Campaign unfinishable, it can be fixed via console commands but doing that disables achievements for that save and after all its not the duty of the player to find workarounds or fix the games issues.

Conclusion:
I would overall still recommend this game especially if its on sale, the original RTW is one of my favorite strategy games seeing it being remastered and made to run on modern hardware is something I've been waiting for. It still is at its core the same experience we are used to but with updated visuals, which is what a remaster should be about, but some of the changes like the UI ones and the bugs that came along with this can be a turn off for some. I really hope that they at least address these issues so that we can have a truly flawless experience for years to come.",1620806911,1620806911,True,23,0,0.66087949275970459,0,True,False,False

There was no nostalgic feelings that drew me to this game, nor any nostalgia-tinted glasses that allowed me to turn a blind eye to real issues because of some warm feelings and good memories. That is why I can confidently say that it isn't nostalgic-bias which causes me to WHOLEHEARTEDLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME. It is worth every penny, and more.

My Total War experiences prior to Rome Total War Remastered were many. I'd played Total War Attila, Thrones of Britannia, and the Fall of the Samurai. And to be totally honest, as much as I enjoyed these newer, more sophisticated Total War games, with tons of quality-of-life improvements...they were just so ridiculously convoluted and tediously complicated. I spent four and half hours trying to learn how to play Britannia before I could even complete my first campaign turn. And Attila took me hours and hours and hours of wading through unit descriptions and countless online guides before I could even begin to understand combat...much less the campaign! What I'm saying is, irregardless of all the positive additions and expanded gameplay mechanics, it isn't 2004 anymore. The Total War franchise has become a bloated and overloaded beast, with so, so, so many features that are guaranteed to scare away any potential new players due to the behemoth-sized learning curve. There are just too many features, too many equations, too many numbers to crunch, too many positive-negative variables. In my first 15 minutes of playing, my first thought was, ""Why aren't the other Total War games more like this?"" And in mere days of playing, my approval of this game continues to soar. The only reason that I've racked up only 22 hours so far because I'm in the midst of university summer classes, otherwise my total playtime would be at least double that.

This game is awesome. Combat: Simple enough to be enjoyable, but still challenging. Campaign: There is still a lot to learn and manage, but the entire experience is more like a cool glass of water and less like a blasting fire-house. For Rome Total War: Remastered, its elegance is in its simplicity. Its perfection is that it has gone back to basics.

Five out of four stars. I love this game. I see why the 2004 original was so popular. It is so easy for a non-Total War savante to pick this up, and start enjoying themselves in no time...skipping the inevitable undergraduate-dissertation-sized homework required before playing modern Total War games.",1620741346,1620741346,True,203,7,0.824311435222625732,9,True,False,False

The Good:

+ Graphic upgrades are good and don't ruin the essence of the original game
+ Good optimization
+ New campaign map features (even if they are worthless)
+ New UI during battles

The Bad:

- The same god awful pathfinding.
- Units can still be unresponsive to commands (Same as Rome 2004)
- Online mode is still a laggy mess and uses 2004's system. Crazy that the online hasn't been updated.
- Zero balancing and rework done for units that needed nerfing or buffing. This is just plain laziness.
- Siege Battles are still broken and haven't been fixed.

They overhauled all the graphics, UI, as well as many other quality of life improvements. There are small changes here or there that need improvements, but Rome Remastered is truly faithful to the original game.  

The reality is over the last 15 years the Total War Franchise has changed drastically and created a wide variety of fans with a wide variety of tastes.  The largest split I feel exists, as I am part of it, is between the Fantasy/Historical Drama lovers who love the Individual story arcs of the new games and those who do not like the direction the new games face.  

Personally I absolutely abhor most of the new game mechanics implemented in the new games. The 3 Warhammer games with the fantasy element have completely alienated me. I have no desire to take dragons and orcs into battle with me. I also have no desire to watch Heroes literally tear holes through entire units in Troy and Three Kingdoms the few times I play out a battle. The older Total War games like Rome were great to me because I was able to min-max an economy and in Rome abuse growth rates to hit the Marian Reforms quickly. It may have been simple but at the time there was no other mainstream game like that. The 3D battles were great, but honestly outside of the first campaign battle, I would seldom choose to fight out a battle unless I had to cheese it. I played the early Total Wars because you got to paint a campaign map with semi-historical overtones that the newer games don't necessarily lack, but there now there far better alternatives in the Paradox Games. 

Do not get me wrong, Total War's battles are what makes the series unique, but for many it was just a part of the game and enjoyed it because of the historical realism of their sims. Over the 6 years the Paradox Games have become a fringe franchise only few die hard strategy gamers have heard of to mainstream. I believe it has been helped along by Paradox capturing this type of demographic. Sure its not 1 for 1 people are complicated. The Game of Thrones mod is one of the best mods for CK2, but for some people it was less about the battles and literally painting your color on the map. 

Which leads me back to the negative reviews. Please stop bombing an older title because it does not have the same feel as a newer Total War, especially when Creative Assembly did its very best to integrate old and new TW players with so many different settings options. When I hear comments like , ""It's AI is bad"" what does it matter to you if they AI is bad when Hero's basically act like an army of Bezerkers in every battle. At least Bezerkers are a unit rather than 1 individual. I totally get why many people find that feature awesome. I am not trying to throw shade at you. It clearly works monetarily for CA!

Many older Total War players liked the franchise for a different reasons and a REMASTER should not get review bombed, ""because I don't like it"". And there is a huge difference between ""I don't like it because it doesn't play like a modern total war"" and I don't like it because ""They fucked up the remaster and it is no longer faithful to the original title"".

I got Total War: Rome in 2004/2005ish back when you had to have a physical CD to install/play it. One of my all time absolute favorite games. Which is why with a heavy heart I can't recommend the Remastered version.

Quick explanation:
- AI pathing is somehow significantly worse than the original.
- The game crashes often.
- You need to manually save often as the crashes corrupt the current turn you are in.
- Auto resolve battle ends in defeat most of the time regardless of force superiority.
- New UI is clunky.

For those who want more of an explanation I will elaborate.

The original Total War: Rome (released 2004) had a fairly simple AI pathing system, however it worked fairly well and usually didn't cause stress. 

In the original Rome from almost 20 years ago ( I really want to stress this) you were able to position your troops tightly in city streets. The formation selector simply just showed red if the placement was invalid and yellow if you were good to go. You could tweak formations in order to get them just right.

The new remaster that released in May of 2021 has 'updated' the formation selection tool to where it now auto-snaps. If you try and place units in a precarious alley it won't let you at all. (This becomes insanely annoying when working with war dogs)  The War dog unit does not have a 'formation' they form as a gaggle, this makes them unable to be placed anywhere besides dangerously far from the city square near an opening.

Fighting in small towns near the city square. If you have been playing Total War for a while you already know how sometimes you are just going to be severely outnumbered. 

In the original this wasn't an issue due to the forgiving unit formation placement. Once the battle got going repositioning units wasn't going to cost you the battle.

Unfortunately in the 'improved' Remastered the AI doesn't seem to recognize they are in a city square, in fact it seems that the AI doesn't really know what's going on at all. Most of the time engagements requiring reinforcements from units within the square will have them path back to the flag and than out to the side. This obviously takes a significant amount of time. Unsurprisingly having units completely expose their back to reposition just a few feet away will end up costing close to have your unit.

Specifically spear men, in the original they would remain in their Phalanx formation with spears down forward. In the Remastered version the AI more often than not will switch to their secondary which will cost the battle especially when playing as one of the Barbarian factions.


Another thing that has to be micromanaged like crazy is all of the units are set to auto run EVERYWHERE. So if you give a command they are running. I am used to the original where you would need to double click to make your units run. I found out vary fast after getting into a few battles where all of my units were exhausted before the fighting even occurred. 


Another issue with the AI pathing is just battles in general. For example in the original telling your cavalry to charge ahead of them would result in the cavalry charging directly in front of them.... you know like how you ordered.  In the new Remaster if you position the cavalry to the side of say ... a Phalanx formation and tell them to assault their very vulnerable side there is a very good chance the cavalry will get close to the side, come almost to a stop and reposition in front of the phalanxes and then proceed to attack... This is incredibly frustrating.


The new 'optimized' AI pathing is just really bad.

Another big negative is this game crashes a decent amount. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if it didn't corrupt that turn. Not sure what sets it off. It is usually when ending a turn and when the enemy AI tries to break a siege. Manually fighting the battle will end in my game hard freezing at first contact with the enemy. I can consistently reproduce this.

The only fix is to break the siege and then try again next turn (pretty frustrating). Or reload from a previous save from a few turns ago.

Merchants? Why? They don't add anything. Should of focused on not absolutely destroying the AI.

My last gripe which is just a minor inconvenience is the auto-resolve battle function is now completely useless. Sometimes I do not want to waste time taking my army of Gothic cavalry and spearbands to fight 3 rebel peasants manually. However auto-resolve will just say it was a defeat most of the time. Or a 'Close Victory' where my army of 1500 troops vs 400 will absolutely get decimated.

The UI is absoloutely horrendus, as if it was made for a mobile game, The adventure map is too bright and colourful (even on the 'Realistic' setting, old games like Shogun 2 have a much more fleshed out map.

the original rome tw runs like ass on my system (r5 3600, 3060ti). after over an estimated 1000 hours in the original rome and almost 10 hours in the remastered version, i gotta admit that overall, i´m massively disappointed. 

pro:
- the battle graphics are enhanced, game runs at a way higher fps rate than the original
- the remastered version supports higher resolutions
- i personally love the new camera control mode, but the game also offers to use the old one.
- the ai reacts smarter than in the orignal
- some general improvements were made. for example the game now lets you set the tax policy in cities where no general is present, which i always found super annoying about the original. 

cons:
- the tactical campaign map looks like plain shit and worse than the original. i run the game on ultra settings and the map still looks blurry. characters on the map are super hard to identify. you basically have to select a diplomat or a merchant to see which fraction he belongs to most of the time. i haven´t found a single satisfying setting after tweaking around for an hour. 
- the interface is a nightmare. you now have super tiny windows for building or producing units that are literally hurting your eyes after a while of playing, since you have to stare into them to see everything clearly. 

right now for me, this game is unplayable. it´s impossible to enjoy all the good and necessary improvements that were made. the devs desperately need to patch rome remastered, giving access to the old interface and doing something about the campaign map issues.

 in contrast to the newer total war games you can only make one unit per turn in a region. yes, only one. so you better think about which one you want to make. because in ten or twenty turns this unit might still be part of your army that is just ravaging the iberian peninsula. or maybe it is gone already one round after you recruited it, absorbed by some greek phalanx doomstack unkillable armored unit that is broken and OP - at least on very hard difficulty that could easily happen.
because honestly - and that brings me to the flaws - the AI is not exactly smart. i don´t know how to describe it. i guess it just does the same things every battle. somehow it doesn´t bother me that much. because this game has it´s challenges nonetheless. well sometimes.
look, it´s really hard to rate this game. you should probably try it out. honestly i don´t get most of the negative reviews. i understand that people don´t like the UI. personally i absolutely love it. everything looks so much more intricate, it´s smaller than in the original. it looks a bit more serious, because not every unit or building description is covering half of the screen. but if you hate it, that´s fine. maybe they should add an option to use the original UI?
but then many of the other comments i don´t understand:
"" it doesn´t have the feel of the original"", ""the grass looks horrible with the newer graphics"", ""back in the day carthago had three subfactions, they are not there anymore"", this kind of comments weird me out a bit - especially the last one in it´s blatant falseness. i read nonsensical comments like this everywhere here, and i feel like i have to be a bit of a white knight for feral and the team behind the remastered version. i wonder what people expected. it is a remastered, you know what that means, right? it´s not a new game by any means. i mean i think it´s kinda cool that they went to add new features at all, and the ones they added are cool, like the merchants for example(even though i don´t really get them yet, CA make a blog or video to explain them please, i mean regarding the weird fluctuations in the amount of money they earn, obviously there is a deeper system behind it). and they even showed all of the new features in one short video, which happens to be the very first video that plays on steam when you look up the game. it´s short and to the point, you see exactly what has changed. so why are people disappointed?
okay. there are some bad things.
pathfinding: it´s kinda ridiculous in settlements. needs a fix asap. because for some reason now the units sometimes want to go to their assigned positions via weird detours. you want to place them in front of an enemy unit on the city plaza? their pathfinding might make them wanna go to the middle of the plaza (into the enemy unit) and back.
oh and dev´s if you read this, please fix the following so that people who use doubleclick running like me can enjoy the game as it deserves to be enjoyed: for some reason at times the doubleclick doesn´t trigger running, only walking, which might make you for example lose a cavalry unit that you wanted to nope out of a bad situation. casually walking away from enveloping cataphract cavalry usually doesn´t end very well for most units. at other times however it works properly. it seems to switch back and forth between working and not working multiple times during a battle and i dont know what could be the trigger for that. please look into that, because it makes multiplayer matches very tedious and often needlessly frustrating(and i just really don´t like one click running, as i find it very unimmersive to always having to stop my army from doing so when moving them - i don´t think that real armies are eager to run everywhere at all times and need to be always stopped by they´re generals from their overeagerness).
okay but i think that´s it about the bad stuff for me. the game is still amazing and it looks better than ever. the balances are so much weirder than in the newer total war games - but that is all part of the fun. and even if you are a veteran and think you know how the game works, a quick google search for some details or controls for the game might change your mind, as i still keep finding out plenty of new things about the game mechanics to this very day. and they are very complex actually - but logical for the most part.
if you are a veteran and don´t expect a new game, but just a prettier version of the old game, and if you can handle the smaller UI, if you have OCD and like (mostly pointless) statistics and graphics and screens about trade income and base farming levels and so on, then this is for you. you can now assign agents to their targets in three different ways: on the campaign map, in some small mission menu, and in an extended agent mission menu. a little bit more complicated than it needs to be maybe - i love it!
all in all it´s just a prettier rome. and rome was a very good game. and this is a very good game. fight me!

ps: now mods can be published in the steam workshop and activated with one simple click, which is unprecedented for the rome and medieval 2 engine. already modders are falling over themselves trying to bring us and tease us with upcoming total overhaul mods. i prophesy a great and bright future for this game!
pps: i am not a native english speaker and if you found grammatical or spelling errors you may keep them.

EDIT: feral please fix the doubleclick running which is as of now only working sometimes. i have lost countless units and even more nerves because my troops sometimes instead of running away are going for a little stroll. it is the only reason that keeps me from playing multiplayer as of now. it f´ed me over multiple times both in multiplayer and singleplayer games. it has to be the simplest thing to fix of all. so please, pretty please, feral, fix it, before i lose my sanity over it... thank you in advance. and i love almost everthying about your remaster otherwise! keep it up!",1620223756,1620660917,True,2,0,0.49487873911857605,0,True,False,False

Negatives: There are many complaints about the UI being not great, and for the most part I agree. The campaign interface feels cluttered, and many screens are very small even with UI scaling set to max. Oddly enough, the remaster crashes more often than the original did, on the same Win10 PC. Agents in particular can be annoying to manage, since hovering over a target will not show the chance for success. Otherwise I like the tiny, very small mission window. 

Positives: The campaign AI is noticeably improved. The other Roman factions are now less incompetent, though nothing approaching a human player. The merchant system is a fun little mechanic, which can be set to automanage if the player so chooses. Battles are significantly better both in terms of stability and AI. Massive battles with many thousands of soldiers don't stutter at normal speed like they did in the original. The AI also has some improved avoidance to wall defenses, though it's not perfect. I appreciate the follower moving system, but wish that we could use the old method for characters in the same army or settlement. I haven't gotten to the late game in either of my campaigns yet, but I look forward to the adjustments for squalor at Huge City settlement sizes. The ethnic makeup of individual units, while seemingly minor, adds so much realism and is honestly just a very cool mechanic. Diplomacy is SO much better than it used to be, and bribe amounts have become much more reasonable. 

Overall, I'd be happy to recommend this game at the discount price that existing owners received. While the list price isn't a bad deal per se, I would hesitate for a few minutes before caving in to the nostalgia. As with anything new, lots of people will hate it. If you're on the fence, find some gameplay on YouTube or wherever and see if you think you'd enjoy it.",1620655498,1620655498,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like many others, the original Rome Total war was what really launched my PC gaming and interest in history games. I’ve tried playing the original a few times but ran into issues playing in on a modern machine and never gotten very far. The biggest benefit of the remaster are: it runs considerably on my Windows 10 system, better graphics (the campaign map is a little bright but I’m getting used to it), the music!, missile range arcs, and what seems like a lot of behind the scenes balancing. 
The few issues I have with the game are the UI (mainly campaign) is a little confusing and it feels like I have to make mores clicks to see the same information. Also, lots of having to hover over things to see information… Would really like settlements to display the income number on the campaign map not just a Green up or Red down number. Would also like to see total treasury and expected income at the top of the map, not just current treasury. There might be a setting to change these, but I have not found it yet.  
Finally, seen two bugs so far: One an army completely disappeared while moving between ships and the second a merchant was trading oil, but it showed he was trading slaves on one of the menus. 

Will this be my number 1 most played game on Steam? Not likely, it still feels a little dated, but it is great to relive the childhood gaming memories and still have a good time.

Graphics, it looks so much better
Mod support, workshop, you dont have to search online to download mods
Dev's listened to what people wanted pre release

Conclusion:
If they fix whatever is wrong with the CTD loading before a battle and maybe add/redo some things such as the UI and the AI, then I could justify spending money on this Remaster. But as it stands, go play Rome 1 with mods. Much better experience.",1620609505,1620609505,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The fact that it does take away in general however, is very unfortunate. While i don't believe the new UI is as clunky or unusable as some feel it is, there are a few elements it certainly does worse than the original which is pretty dreadful.
i.e.: Interacting with agents used to be a one click operation on the map, now it has to be a tiny submenu, which itself is confusing at best. 
Said submenu is a  nice addition however, it simply shouldn't be the only choice. That theme is present in many other aspects imo, and overall it still is a more pleasant experience than the original, even if not by much.
Had one or two crashes as well, some short but irritating slowdowns / lag and possibly new undesirable behavior from the AI, although without further testing that is hard to nail down.

That said, it is pure Rome. All the fiddling, weird AI behavior, pathing issues, and so on are still present. Bit like playing a modded game.

A decent remastered that did the bare minimum that was required of it. Would easily recommend for anyone who's played Rome 1 before, new players be informed on what you are buying before you do. The new potential for mods is going to be huge and is the main reason you should buy the remastered. 
Pros:
-Good graphics for battles and cities, plus campaign map. 
-New rule set that helps with gameplay (optional) 
-unit sprite diversity
-Moveable companions on the world map 
-Diplomacy is explained better (slightly improved
-Merchants (not ground breaking but cool) 
-achievements to complete
-night battles in the original game
-AI seems to use full stacks more than smaller stacks
-AI seems to do naval invasions slightly better
-Mod Potential (faction cap being increased, 21-31 and other caps increased)
-New opening cut scenes for factions (Even if they are a little lackluster) 
-Better unit stats (able to see morale and alt attack values)
-Helpful tutorial browser for new comers or explained vague rules 
-runs smoother on newer PC's (Actually allows bigger battles)
The cons:
-UI ( Just takes time to get use to, can scale)
-Pathfinding (Clearly one of the big faults of the original)
-Battle AI (Can be pretty brain dead at times)
-No new units being added (Could have been a toggleable feature) 
-No new historical battles (Would have been nice to fight Zama or other epics)
-No big new feature added (either naval battles or co-op campaign) 
Again the remastered is pretty good and is only going to get better with time once epic mods come out. If you can buy the game with the loyalty bonus, I don't see why you wouldn't. Otherwise wait for a sale or buy the game if you know you'll enjoy it. Would have been nice to see feral expand and fix some of the more annoying issues with the original, that being pathfinding and battle AI. Feral said they will be continuing their work on the remastered, so time will tell.

It's baffling, cities are now neigh impossible to manage properly, the game doesn't remember to use speedy animations and constantly many times a turn needs to be reminded and the animations are now TOO speedy. just a hair too quick.

Campaign plays nicely with some improvements to quality of life, for instance toggling movement speed when ending terms, to much more indepth menus using numbers instead of pictograms.

I also prefer the historical over Warhammer games (Love Warhammer universe, just personally prefer historical over fantasy games).

I am extremely disappointed with this remaster. As a Total War veteran, you would think that this would be everything I'd ask for, however despite my attempts to love it, I feel too little has been done to improve the experience.

Positives first, graphics have some noticeable improvement. It looks much better than the original and plays well in general. There are also some re-balanced unit stats which I think make the game a bit fairer and balanced, which is always welcome. Some of the later features such as weapon ranges are also a welcome addition.

Negatives. This is the part I find the most painful. My main issue is with how much have they really changed. The obtrusive and confusing UI makes settlement management and battle management much more confusing, particularly if you are familiar with the original. Some people will be able to look past this, however I found that I couldn't. The AI, particularly in siege battles, is atrocious. I have seen comments and reviews saying 'This is part of the original and thus should not be improved' and I could not disagree more. Considering how old this game is and the wealth of experience CA have now with improving AI, this should have been a priority. I should not be wrestling with units not following commands when I want to be fighting the battle. No, this is NOT realism. Even on the ancient battlefield there were forms of command and control. A unit of lightly armed javelin cavalry should not be charging a phalanx when I ask them to move away. Also, the only big change is the addition of merchants, something which was already added to the engine in Medieval II. True, I don't want massive changes and improvements, but it distinctly feels like there was no effort to truly improve the experience.

Ultimately, even as a Total War fanboy, I cannot recommend this game. The lack of any actual improvements and the abominable AI just totally ruined the experience for me.

I loved the original back in 2005 but this remaster just sucks dick. I mean the nostalgy is great, the soundtrack is even higher quality which is amazing.
The graphics are very nice improvement, I mean the old game had its magic but the game looks really nice, you also have sliders for colors if it looks too vibrant to your eye so graphics are nice now. Except for the unit cards which aren't well made, I even saw some units use same cards as others(or they were really similiar...not really good for the game).

But holy fuck are there some gamebreaking bugs and bullshit in this game. First of all pathfinding is a disaster, this was in the original but I would expect it to be better atleast a little bit, it sometimes even feels like it's even worse than original but I cannot confirm that on 100%. I am so tired of losing battles because your phalanx starts to rotate like some degenerate lidl beyblade and they rout the second they get charged cause they are not in the right position. Also when you rout enemy units there is like 50/50 chance that you are either going to obliterate the rest of the soldiers in like 10 seconds or it is going to take you 2 minutes because your units are going to run 2 metres behind them(even cavalry) and refuse to catch up and finish them. 

Sometimes your units just freeze in the place for no reason, they just stand in their place like some fucking trees. Should I even bother to use skirmisher cavalry anymore? When they freeze after every move command and they obviously get caught up seconds later by enemy cavalry? I am experienced player and I manage to handle this shit most of the time but sometimes there are battles where literally every small mistake counts and it fucking tilts me when the lose is not even thanks to my fault but a fault of the spaghetti code.

Jesus the ui is bad. It is so unintuitive and I get so tilted to look for everything even after 50 hours of gameplay. It is so weird, I don't understand why they didn't leave the old ui alone, that one was perfectly clear. Also some campaign interactions are really strange espeacially agents. I have seen certain situtation atleast 4-5 times where I send my spy into fog of war without any order to actually spy any character or town and when I end turn, I see my spy coming to a random character in the area and ALWAYS when this happened, the spy died. And now the funny part, when I tried to load up end turn save(because this is some stupid bullshit), I couldn't find my spy even when he was supposed to be still alive. Nope he is gone now, because apparently the game decided that he must die. Assassin is also really fucking weird. I can't really click on certain character and send him to kill right away...no, assassins have a special tab with provinces and characters and I can only send him on a ''mission'' from that tab.WHY just WHY.

I have mostly been playing Parthia and Germania and I have few other insights on things besides scuffed phalanxes and horse archers.
Is diplomacy better now?FUCK NO FUUUUCK NO. Holy shit that might actually also be worse than in original or I don't know if my memory is that blurry. I should never bother to get some allies in this game anymore. If you don't play roman factions, you won't really get a support from anyone, quite the opposite actually. It kind of feels like if you get an ally, there's even a bigger chance that the faction will attack you. Overall BIAS against the player is rather unfun. I never get any help from my allies and it seems that pretty much every close faction is looking to kill you no matter what is going on. I found it rather stupid that when I played as Germania and fought Gauls from turn 10 or whatever, the Julii never actually attacked the Gauls(they always attack the Gauls eventually), but as soon as I got into northern Italy a started bordering the Julii, they immediately sent their doomstacks and it just feels shitty that the ai does that. And once I destroyed the Gauls and started bordering Spain(which also didn't fight the Gauls and that almost never happens) they started to send their doomstacks of bull warriors at me...freshly conquered settlements, I can't really even build anything without some fuck being at my city every other turn.
Btw about the Gauls. The remastered diplomacy is supposed to make factions actually protect their life right? Well I had a little clown fiesta situation with the Gauls. I have conquered almost all of their territory with Massilia being the last settlement I just got from them. Well you know there are like 2 bridges that separate Massilia and a little bit of territory from the rest of the province. Right next to Massilia I saw a Gaul general with some units. I think to myself: Well it would be nice if I didn't have to conquer the rest of their settlements so I am going to declare either peace or make them my vassals. Nope both was still very demanding even tho they had like 2 last towns left so I attacked the Gaul general beside Massilia. 
Turns out there were like 4 generals in that army and because they were kind of blocked thanks to the bridge, whole army got wiped out and the faction got destroyed, those were 4 last Gaul family members.
So DON'T try to tell me that the diplomacy is better now!It sucks ass. They rather went for suicide than living in peace beside the strongest faction on the map.

Same with Parthia pretty much. The Seleucids and Egypt fight in 99% games, but as soon as I started attacking Seleucids, they declared alliance with Egypt and they started to spam me with doomstacks which gets really annoying and boring quickly, I don't really even get money to upgrade anything at all, I just fight and fight. Also my Armenian and Pontus allies HAD to betray me too, I am just waiting when Scythia shows up, because that is the last faction in this area that isn't against me yet. I don't mind an active campaign at all but give me a break for fucks sake, this is just so unfun. It literally kills everything else and while I tried to enjoy this game with non roman faction, I just can't enjoy it for longer than 50-80 turns.

As I said I am writing this tilted after a battle I lost because of a bug and I thought I had enough of this shit, this is just unacceptable, I am not really sure what is actually improved besides higher quality soundtrack and graphics, the ai is still rather retarded, the ui is really bad and some controls are propably even worse sometimes thanks to freezing units etc...I know, I know, it is still the old game, with new visuals and some ''tweaks'' and I try to love it so hard after all the time I have played the original as a child, but I guess that I am giving up atleast for some time...

TL;DR: it brings back nostalgy but UI and AI are really wack and better diplomacy my ass, also many stupid bugs that can make your gameplay really bitter. We can clearly see Bethesda syndrome, hopefully the community can save this mess with mods.

BUT the UI is terrible, the pathfinding is worse, and finding the Remastered v Classic toggle menu is neigh-impossible.

The UI got rid of large unit descriptions, and now there's just the tiny Attila-style stats. The unit cards are a joke. For example in Barbarian Invasion, the commititenses (swordsmen) and legio lanciarii (spearmen) are nearly identical. I have to mouse-over the unit cards to figure out what's what, and that defeats the purpose of unit card pictures in the first place!

The pathfinding has problems. Larger unit sizes are uncontrollable around settlements. Cavalry pathfinding is generally bad, but even worse in settlements. Getting units in place for a charge is overly difficult, especially compared to Medieval 2: Total War.

The option menus are completely unintuitive and should be completely redone in line with community feedback. Each problem is minor, but they add up.

Overall, buy the game if you like Total War games. If this is your first Total War game, it's playable if you're patient with learning the quirks. Consider waiting until some of the massive problems are fixed.

Sometimes I couldn't even visual the enemy unit I wanted to hit because it was obscured by the unit stat circles. The scrolling function for the battlefield is counter intuitive. The original Rome Total War One was simpler to use, usually with my mouse, rather than having to alternate between the mouse and keyboard. Change for its own sake doesn't cut it. 

At the strategic level, similar problem. Although the graphics are vivid, the controls are fussy and illogical.  I can use my cursor to move in some directions on the map, but need the keyboard, usually to move west and south. That's plain dumb and inferior to the original game.  The new city interface gives more info but is more complex.  The stat display is fine and easy to read. But the building and troop recruitment process has been made more complicated. Why? The original worked very well. This process offers no advantages that I can see.

My game is now crashing. It's 235 BC and I can't get the game to work even when I load a previously saved instance of my campaign.

There is a new feature which I don't really enjoy. That being the inclusion of a new agent unit called 'Merchants'. These units can generate you extra income if they move around your cities and they can be bought or buy out other factions Merchants to increase their level to do exactly these actions on higher level merchants and earn you more money. Personally, I found it utterly pointless. I saved my gold buying spies to help me siege cities or an extra useful unit. It's the equivalent of a mini-game. I'd rather they just created some new factions or made the campaign map bigger like some of the classic mods like Diadochi or EB.

If you were expecting a classic game updated for modern hardware and graphics, Rome Remastered is the game for you. 

In terms of gameplay and authenticity to the Ancient World, Rome Remastered does well and continues the themes of Rome 1. If you're coming into this looking for an authentic Antiquity warfare experience, I'd recommend Rome 2 with the Divide et Impera mods over this, however, Rome Remastered nails the classic Total War ambiance, experience, and units. In addition, in terms of visuals, Rome Remastered with the ""Realistic"" unit option does an excellent job of representing the units of Antiquity in a true to life form.

Some people may say that the game is just the same old Rome and not enough was done to it, but this is exactly what I wanted from a Remaster of my favorite game. I'm glad they kept the scope of the project to revitalizing the game and modernizing it, avoiding the pitfall of a far too ambitious remake instead of remaster.

* Squalor and culture penalties are punishing for the player but ignored by the AI.
* Chariots and armoured general cavalry are broken - Britannia conquers most of western Europe if left to itself because the AI cannot handle chariot charges, which are broken as shit.
* The AI cannot handle bridges - park 2 units on every bridge and watch the AI suicide into you every turn.
* New merchant character is functionally useless - its easy to have an income of 10k+ once you have half a dozen towns, in which case +50 per turn is irrelivant.
* AI refuses to assault during a siege, and will sit and starve you out regardless of incoming friendly armies.
* AI cannot handle pike formations - draw a line of pikes and the entire enemy army will suicide into you head on, usually led by a frontal charge by their general.
* Pathfinding is broken in cities.
* Auto resolve is broken due to the way it weighs certain units. Auto resolve and get beaten, play the battle and lose 100 men while getting a 1000 kills. This turns every campaign into a tedious mopping up exercise due to not being able to trust the auto resolve function.
* Certain factions cant build an army - go fight Spain and their stacks of 8 wardogs, 8 round shield cavalry and 4 skirmishers. This makes the fights boring, since the enemy armies are typically poorly constructed.
* On the other side of things, the Roman factions go completely the other way - 20 stacks of Praetorians/Urban Cohorts and no army dynacism or balance.

I blame myself for trusting CA again after so many disappointments and their constant movement away from traditional play style and sieges of total war. The AI in this game is horrendously broken. The only real challenge in this game is the same as before..the game breaking mechanic in which no matter how broke and few settlements some of the main factions have..they constantly are able to pump out full stacks. Siege game play is just like pulling teeth, you have to force most of the combat and you have to make it challenging for yourself. Not sure why CA has not addressed this issue and other previous issues from the original game such as units getting stuck in city streets, Path finding in the city is still horrendous. Squalor is still the most time consuming part of managing your faction in the mid to late game. I really want to love this game, I remember the hundred of hours I spent playing and looking at this game. I remember adjusting my CRT monitor to get the best lighting to compliment my battles in the desert as the Carthaginians or Egyptians.

Technical things:
 - Long loading times compared to Rome 1, Empire, even Shogun 2, are abysmal
 - The menus are needlessly bloated and complicated
 - The number of launchers is really staggering
 - The game took 3 attempts to load (first time didn't boot the launcher, second time booted the game but only the audio, it only worked on the third attempt)
 - Whenever the game does load, you have to alt-tab off it and alt-tab back for it to display the menu
 - Lack of any real efficiency. The game doesn't look that great considering its resource usage, idk why but creative assembly or feral interactive have just thrown any efficient code away. Considering what this is, I don't know where all the dev time went because it wasn't in making the game run smooth (or run at all, for that matter)
 - Remember Shogun 2 had a nice in-game wiki? Well, this game makes you shift-tab into steam's overlay to load up a separate menu because fuck you
 - Looking at the wiki for enemy units will just load up some random unit of yours (e.g. loading the Gaul warband will show you the Roman heavy infantry page). Ever heard of play testers?
 - Did I mention the loading times? Because if I did, I'm going to mention them again. The fucking loading times. Rome 1, 20 seconds absolute maximum. This thing takes so much time the loading music actually finishes before you load up a Segestica with 2 barbarian units and 4 Roman units. It's a joke, and an unbearable one at that. The only Total War game which made me quit after the first battle


Gameplay mechanics:
 - Merchants are not fun, idk who came up with the idea but they need to be fired

Things that make the game feel not nice:
 - No army even attempts to march instep, everyone marches out of unison because I guess that's cooler? Makes your elite Roman army feel more like a rabble
 - The sound of your men marching is weak, can hardly hear it. Remember in Rome 1 you'd zoom in and be intimidated by the sound of all your soldiers marching?
 - The gladius looks super long, because I guess big swords are cooler. Even for their sheath they're too big. For their intended purpose, they look too big and clumsy compared to Rome 1
 - The cutscenes. Why do we feel the need to have this weird animated comic cartoon vibe going on? Even the main menu has this poorly animated guy waving a sword around. It looks like a youtuber with 37 subs did this
 - Why the hell does every single projectile have an aura around it? I can see that's a pila flying through the air, but why is it lit up like a fucking glowstick? I wouldn't be so bothered by it if there was a way to turn it off, but thanks to the weird menus that's no easy task

Overall, play Rome 1. There are some improvements, but I can count the improvements on a single hand and while they're nice to have, the unbearable loading times and your Roman legions feeling pretty pathetic doesn't really cover it. If there's a mod that makes your men march in unison and with louder marching sounds then link it, I'd love to see it. But the big thing for me, the loading times.

Also to anyone in the comments who are going to say ""loading times are fine for me"" and ""get a better computer"", I'll leave you with this. These graphics are not better than Shogun 2. Yet I can load Shogun 2 without the loading music actually fucking ending, you know, since it doesn't take a decade to load. Empire can load up a 4000 man battle in less than a minute. Even on the lowest settings they've just borked it. If you're gonna re-release a game from 2004 maybe rework the engine instead of just slapping more shit on it and making it slow as balls.

What a game that was. IMHO the best Total War game ever released (considering its time). 

No successive TW game was such a shock to the genre like Rome was, bringing a lot of features and innovations, and being such a technical marvel at the same time. It was simply incredible, in 2004, having battles with THOUSANDS of soldiers with such detailed 3D models and such a complex combat system.

And let me say that there are still some aspects of this old game that make newer TW games envious: a more believable mass and collision system than the Warscape engine games, a strong connection between campaign map and battle map (you start a fight in campaign in a tile with certain terrain features? Those will be present in the battlemap! You build an aqueduct in Athen? That will appear when enemy will besiege you there, or you could just jump to it through city view, a feature that apparently CA forgot about its existence, since it was never implemented again) .
And many more other features, such as a lot of good role playing elements thanks to the event and traits&ancillaries system for characters, incredible general speeches, a magnificent timeless soundtrack, and its moddability. So many mods, even total conversions, got released for this game and its successor (Medieval 2).

But Rome had some problems, and some other things that many people didn't like. Anachronistic faction rosters (hi bronze age Egyptians!), unbalanced and neglected barbarian factions, supper fast battles, and many others; but fortunately you could ""fix"" those with mods.

But there were others, bigger ones, which could be barely touched by modders, since they were hardcoded: senseless diplomacy, bad pathfinding in sieges, and the AI, especially battle AI. Oh my god, the battle AI was so bad also for 2004 standards that it was a meme back then, even if this term didn't exist.

So, what about this remaster? Well, to put shortly the remaster is good old Rome:TW with an improved look, better performance for today HW, a new UI and some small fixes, improvements and new bugs. 
I will not talk about these, there are many good things Feral did, others not so much and other things that can be subjective; but I will not judge them since my limited playtime. I will go straight to the 2 big elephants in the room that are clearly noticeable and  that made me give a negative judgement and refund the game:

Battle AI and Pathfinding.

Like I said before, battle AI was considered bad even in 2004. It's now 2021. 
And they released the Remastered with the same brain dead AI. 
IMHO this is unacceptable, and something that will not make me enjoy the game anymore. I could've tolerated, in 2004, having an AI that shows no clear plan or strategy, keeping no cohesion among its units, constantly making its soldiers running left and right and get them tired, before committing to an attack. And if it was able to charge you, that was already an accomplishment since the AI, especially when fighting a defensive battle, would not engage you most of the times and passively soak all the arrows and projectiles you threw at it, decimating its army. Experiencing this again  is simply not fun for me, they made no improvements in this aspect, and I'm so disappointed about this.
If they had brought the Medieval 2 AI (which was not the smartest in the world, but at least an improvement), I would have been happier. I don't know why they didn't do that, since it shouldn't be such an impossible tasks, due to the fact these 2 games share the same engine, and Feral Interactive (remastered dev studio) ported other features from Med2 in Rome (merchants, AI naval invasions, variations among soldier of the same unit, etc).

And the other big problem, pathfinding. Not only they didn't improve this in sieges, they managed  to make it even worse (I tested this recently, firing my old Rome 1.5 no-Steam copy)! Maneuvering an army in cities in such a chore, even with ""large"" unit size (let's not talk about ""huge"" or ""extreme""), many times units will ignore your orders, follow impossible routes, or get stuck in a limbo where they don't know if throwing their pila or engaging in melee. 
So many moments of frustration, and this is also a hindrance to the AI system, making its units freeze and unable to react sometimes.

There have been also a lot of complaints for the UI, especially campaign UI. It's not the worst thing in the world, but it's surely not a good UI. They had 2 low risk routes they could have chosen: keeping the old UI, or using a ""modern TW"" UI. They chose to go for a third route with this ""minimalistic"" mobile style UI and failed miserably (there's so much hate towards this, though some people are clearly exaggerating). Still, it was a failure, considering the old UI was good, even for today standards; it just needed some small improvements.
One of the things that worries me the most about this UI is how it's hard to manage notifications and events, and how tiny the building and unit detail panels are: since I intended to play the game with some big mods in the future, this is particularly worrying. Most popular Rome mods are so rich of history and info, and these are covered through unit, building and events description. Reading through such tiny and hard to navigate panels would be not a pleasant experience. And that would be a problem even from a gameplay perspective, since mods tend to add a lot of units, building effects, scripts and other gameplay changes, and these hard to navigate and tiny panels will simply not be suited to the task, like the old UI was.
But modders will mod the UI, so there's no problem, right? Well... in every TW game campaign UI has never been moddable in a extensive way, there have never been new UIs (except some simple retexturing), so I doubt this will be different in this remaster, so probably we have to rely on the devs for UI changes.


So, I'm asking for a refund now. As I have stated playing with such a bad battle AI and pathfinding is not fun anymore for me. Others may not find this such a problem, so good for them.


This wasn't meant to be a review, just a way to share my thoughts. If you want a detailed review I suggest to watch Darren video, where you can also see the battle AI and pathfinding in action.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=midZRaH3SRY

What's the future about this remaster? Will it be supported? I have no clue, I will surely check on it  in the future and, if a miracle happens and they manage to improve the AI, the pathfinding and fix the other problems and bugs I will surely buy it again, even at full price.

But unfortunately, for now, devs seem so dead silent about their plans (except for some pre release discord Q&A), not acknowledging the problems,bugs and people feedback (heck, there's not even a ""official"" place where to post them so you're sure that someone responsible is reading these), so I'm no too optimistic.

Sometime you can see some CA community manager around but, instead of gathering and acknowledging feedback, they seem more preoccupied in posting ""promotional"" Rome Remastered videos of some clueless dude in a toga, something completely unrelated to the game. How does this improve their sales is a mystery to me.

One example: playing on hardest difficulty just causes AI to spam attack all of your cities with one or two poor quality units, that do not retreat when attacked by fully stacked armies.  As a result it turns into a grind fest of having to fight battle after battle to break sieges.  

Another example, you spend time cultivating good relations with a neighbour and they just attack you for no reason whatsoever when your relations are at maximum friendship.

I was initially impressed with the battle mechanics, the AI would quickly turn its units to meet flank attacks, but actually once you figure out that all you need to do is engage melee with melee and then hit them with even a weak cavalry attack, it doesn't take long before the entire AI army collapses.

* Don't seem to be any new maps in campaign or multiplayer? Missed opportunity. 
* No new units (optional)? Another missed opportunity.
* The new ""modern"" UI I mostly am not a fan of. It looks like a mobile game touchscreen UI - which makes sense considering that's what Feral does. I really would like an option for the old original UI with some small updates. The original UI was much more immersive as well.
* I feel like projectile speeds (arrows/slingshots) have been vastly decreased and made like Rome 2/Warhammer. Don't like this. But I could be wrong about this.
* The Battle AI basically seems the same to me - aka bad. The main problem with Rome 1 in my opinion was always the AI, particularly the Battle AI. That is what needed improved the most more than anything. However, from playing it seems to me like the Battle AI is exactly the same (pretty bad, does a lot of very dumb stuff). If the Battle AI hasn't been improved that will be extremely disappointing and kind of make the whole thing pointless. There should be a baseline competent Battle AI in my opinion, with variations introduced based on the culture, nation and the particular General. I think that would be the most interesting and fun way to play against AI armies on the battlefield.
* ​At least some of the original faction intro videos (I think) have been replaced with new ones. I want the old ones. Make it a game option please.
* Should be an option to make towers only fire when garrisoned like in Medieval 2. Make it an option.
* Camera movement speed option needs to be split into two - battle maps and campaign map. 
* New feature: Scout View - like City View but for battlefields. Allows an army (even one unit) to view the terrain it's standing on. For all Total War games actually.
* A blood DLC - Three Kingdoms blood was done really well I think. Especially the blood in the water.
* Feral Interactive/CA should release new DLC and campaigns for Rome Remastered the same way Forgotten Empires has been releasing new DLC for Age of Empires 1/2/3 Definitive Edition.
* Make color coding of character traits a setting. I don't like how it looks. Feral and CA in general need to think of immersion when designing things. 
*The way that Character skill levels have been turned into a single icon with a number or bar is bad. Another imitation of Rome 2's UI. Having a Character's Influence be represented by how many wreaths he had was visually pleasing to the eye and easy to understand at a glance. The same goes for Command and Management and Subterfuge skills. A highly skilled Character would have very long lines of stars, scrolls and wreaths. Now it just looks like a game bar stat.
* I don't like how the Character Traits and Retinue are being presented either as a huge wall of text. The text description should be in the tooltip. Make it an option if needed.
* Units getting stuck on siege towers was a big problem in the original if I recall. I noticed this bug once so far.
* Have the 199 settlement and 19 faction hard limits been lifted? I hope so because this was a big limitation for modders. It should at least be raised to Medieval 2's 299 settlement and 29 faction limit.
* New Feature: more Historical Battles would be awesome. 
* Bigger battles (more armies) would be cool.
* A ""men retreated"" and ""friendly fire kills"" added to the Battle Statistics screen would be cool.
* Allowing Retinue to just simply be transferred between Characters is a big mistake and really undermines the immersion and character development. Retinue are one of the things that make a Character unique and feel like a real developing person. If you can just transfer them between Characters then it just becomes a gamey mechanic. This should be a toggle option in the settings. (Someone told me this was in the original - could be misremembering)
* Being able to play as both sides in the Historical Battles would be cool. Always hated how it only allowed you to play one side.
* Buttons on the UI to rotate a unit in place would be cool. Buttons on the UI to wheel a unit left or right would be cool. I believe Medieval 2 had these controls on the UI.
* New Feature: One thing the Total War battles have always needed in my opinion is the ability to tell a unit to walk in reverse. A fighting retreat basically, at a customizable speed maybe. Like Hannibal did at Cannae for example. However, it probably should be a difficult maneuver to do while engaged with the enemy (risk of rout) and require great discipline/veterancy and/or the presence of a good General.
* In general I believe the Total War teams should look at the very robust and advanced battle/unit controls that exist in the Wargame and Steel Division series by Eugen. Would be great for Total War battles as well. Especially when the battles get very large.
* New Feature: More advanced ""place under AI control"" commands would be welcome. For example: hold this location, take this location, protect my right flank, flank the enemy army, harass the enemy skirmishers, destroy the enemy cavalry, etc.
* New Feature: There are some other unit commands I would like to see in Total War battles in general. For example: scout the battlefield (while avoiding battle), the classic RTS ""attack move command (moving to a location and destroying enemies along the way in your path), stealthily move to a location (trying to avoid spotting by the enemy), fast move to a location (using roads & trails on the map for example), avoid friendly fire (telling a projectile unit to avoid firing on an enemy unit if it will kill your own soldiers - could be customizable level even), roam the battlefield and skirmish (telling a skirmishing unit like horse archers to roam the whole battlefield and harass the enemy), a ""riposte"" toggle (telling a unit to only open fire on the enemy if they attack you - very useful for ambushes), a ""reverse fire"" toggle (telling a projectile unit to automatically turn around to attack enemies in a different direction), etc.
* New Feature: More diplomacy options like in Attila, Three Kingdoms, Europa Universalis 4 etc.

I'm pretty happy with the game but also it has some issues. UI being the big one for me. I hope Feral and CA make it a long term project and not just a cash grab. They should support it like Forgotten Empires/Microsoft has supported the Age of Empires Definitive Editions with updates and new DLC etc. 

I believe a Beta probably should have been done before this release.

Update: 

* Being able to use the original style unit cards should be a game option.
*Being able to use the original videos (faction intros etc) should be a game option.
* The volcano eruption in the original had fire and lava. The remastered version is just a puff of smoke it seems. Bug?
* The Wonder videos appear to be missing from the remaster? Bug?
* The Senate videos appear to be missing from the remaster? Bug?
* The Advisor voice appears to be missing from the remaster? Bug?

The UI changes are okay. I personally prefer the original interface for city and army management, but the alert and empire overview changes are very welcome.
-The ability to see unit pathing on the battlefield and hide foliage is very welcome.
-The ability to disconnect unit size from how much population they take from a city on recruitment is very welcome.

Camera angles in battle are changeable and I learned this as one of the first things the tutorial teaches you how to do, despite some people insisting in their negative reviews that you can't and that it's unplayably bad.

The ""too vibrant"" colours can be changed in the settings by turning down the... vibrancy slider and switching the colours for map units to realistic.

I mean, it's more than passable gameplay-wise, it's great. The unit pathfinding is... mediocre as always, it's one of the eternal problems of Total War, and unit behaviour also has its ""What in the fresh hell are you doing?"" moments.

Most of my issues with it mostly centre on small things such as... Egypt being about 2000 years out of date, all Gallic lands being united under a single super-Gaul that can steamroll most other factions if it wants, the fact that seemingly every unit is gated behind a specific building, meaning half of the units you start with will be unable to be retrained and reinforced for several turns at best, the arbitrary nature of autoresolve battles being so heavily stacked but ending horribly anyways. Small things.

It takes the original and makes it feel a lot less archaic, which is something I marvel at considering that the game is old enough to be on the Hub. It mixes the feeling of the old game with adjustments and modernizations that also make it feel like a fairly recent Total War.

Pros:
-Improved graphical quality
-Improved camera controls
-stable frame rates in larger scale battles
-All nations now playable without altering game files

Cons:
-Enemy AI is even worse
-Unit movement is abysmal
-Campaign map UI has too many steps and hidden features
-Unable to purchase original game (correct me if i'm wrong)

The biggest issue I have with this remaster is the awful unit movement and enemy AI. I run into the same problem where my units will take unnecessary routes to get to where i'm telling them to go as well as lining up in different formations than what i had originally ordered. This causes delays in gameplay and sometimes is fatal in the heat of battle. When attacking cities, units almost NEVER enter the guard towers on the first attempt. they will attempt to get into formation but stand still and allow themselves to be targeted by the defense towers costing you units. City defense has always been rather easy with choke points but i feel the enemy AI is even worse in this remaster and it becomes extremely boring. i find myself setting my units up then playing at 3X speed until the time runs out or the enemy army routes after mindlessly hurling themselves into a death trap.",1620437959,1620437959,False,7,0,0.565194785594940186,0,True,False,False

Imagine commanding an army and building cities in the ancient world!  I could be the Ceasar of my own little personal world!  This Remastered game has not only given me the childlike wonder and awe I remember from when I first bought the original, but it's given me so much more.  Solely on the ability to download mods from the workshop makes this game worth the money.  This doesn't even touch on the extreme upgrades to graphics in battle and on on the campaign map.  Different faces, ethnicities, and wear on armor to name a few.  When it rains troops get muddy and each individual soldier has a different variation of dirty armor.

*The UI is a little awkward and makes you click 2 or 3 times to do something that should take one click... but a small price to pay for a better UI over all!
*The only other critique I can make is a stamens of hope.... CA please continue work on this game... develop more content, units, and patches.... make it optional but keep this Remaster alive for years to come!",1620430814,1620430814,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False
885970,91613732,76561197993869876,0,7,5171,0,3324,1623633938,"Overall I give it a positive review. I played the ever-loving-shit out of Rome back in 2004 and even have had dreams featuring the map music from the game in the years since. It was instrumental in forming my interest in ancient history and my preference for strategy games when I was younger and picking it up for the first time. As a 30 something grump, it's really fun playing as Carthage with updated, cleaner graphics and models and getting those old feelings like a shit head teen again, stomping through rome with my elephants and bribing over generals to my side like I'm collecting Pokemon. Merchants are an awesome addition as well, nice way to boost your income and another micro-management game to make the map more interesting between fights. There are some drawbacks which are well covered in other reviews. The UI is an issue, the game isn't balanced for larger-ultra units (and the pathfinding in cities shows it), there are numerous bugs in battle that weren't present in the original, slinger and skirmisher firing arcs are messed up and range in general doesn't seem accurately reflected by the range indicators, Cavalry charges seem to lack the oomphf and flying bodies I remember but that could be nostalgia warping my memories; but I expect some patches or mods to correct a lot of these problems in the near future as the game's mod community matures. That brings me to my next point: Modding. The real reason I bought this game is because I expect some incredible mods to come out and make the game way more awesome in the coming months. Mod support will really separate this game from the OG RTW in time, mark my words. In the meantime, while those mods are getting worked out, it's still a rad trip down memory lane, and the Barbarian invasion and Alexander expansions are included which is also a cool inclusion (but to be honest I spend 95% of my time in the original Rome). If you fondly remember the game from back in the day, this is a no-brainer buy, especially when it inevitably gets a nice discount during a steam sale. If you are someone who is interested in getting into Total War games, the technical limitations of a 17 year old game might turn you off without my old-man rose-tinted glasses, so you might be better served with a more modern entry into the series.",1620428526,1620428613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Best parts IMO:
The voices are awesome in original Rome. The Romans sound like grizzled American soldiers, it just sounds much more awesome than the nerdy Brittish voice actors in the newer games. If not making them have mean Italian accents, at least give us kick-ass American ones! 
The generals have pre-battle cinematic speeches that reflect their traits. I was disappointed when CA removed them in newer games. Imagine how awesome they would be in Warhammer?!
The spies sound sneaky and awesome. Also, they are all dudes, which is the way it was supposed to be!
No women soldiers, this is annoying as shit in the new games, some 95 pound woman throwing 250-lb armored men accross the battlefield! While funny af, it is immersion breaking in newer games and should be under ""immersion"" setting.
No woman generals. While I understand there have been exceptions historically, it is annoying af in newer games when half of generals are 95-lb females! Romans were barbaric pillagers for Christ sake! 
The map is moddable. Original Rome and Medieval were so loved mostly because of this. It allows mods to create entire new worlds and adds thousands of hours of gameplay for the gamers.

Long version:
I've played the original since 2004, and only stopped playing because it doesn't work well on newer systems.
I had a few expectations for this game: to run well on modern systems, better AI and better pathfinding.

It does run pretty smooth, for some reason it keeps my gpu usage at around 100% (viewed in task manager) which is weird since the other more graphically demanding TW games don't do this on my machine.

Now for the AI: the campaign AI does seem to be better compared to the original, but the battle AI to me feels worse. I remember that the battle AI used to derp out from time to time, but it would skirmish, form a solid battle line and try to flank with cavalry at least. Now in the remaster, I played a campaign as Macedon and went against the Romans. They advance on my position, throw their pila and then just stand there at an awkward angle. I engage some of their units with my phalanx and then the rest derp out even more, they start charging my battle line and at the last second do a 180 and get routed and slaughtered by my troops since they get hit in the rear. Every single battle that I have played had some weird things like this in it.

About the pathfinding: I know and remember quite vividly that pathfinding was not the best in the original, but my god does it seem even worse in this one. Maybe it's because I am on ultra unit size, but siege battles are a debacle to say the least. For examples: my units were on the walls and would not move, no matter what I did, they just stood there being moved down by enemy towers. Another example is one unit of phalanx pikemen moving on a city street, the enemy is approaching with some cavalry so I tell them to stop. They stop and a full 30 seconds pass before the cavalry gets near them. As they get near, the men in the phalanx decide to do an impromptu macarena and mess up their formation. They get caught out of formation, rout and I lose 200+ men because of this.

Unfortunately, even if I am looking back at the original with rose tinted glasses, this is not 2004 anymore and issues like the strange AI behavior and pathfinding should be fixed, or at least mitigated. For the current price (30EUR) I cannot recommend this game as there are better total war games on the market.",1620407883,1620407883,False,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I was hoping this game would simply be the same game but with seriously enhanced graphics.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  The interface windows/screens have been changed in just about all cases, always for the worse.  The original game had a wonderful interface for cities, allowing you to build units and buildings and see information with ease.  This new interface makes all of those things significantly more painful.  Want to see descriptions of units/buildings?  It will bring you to an out-of-game horrible wiki page, rather than in-game like the original.  Want to build units/structures?  You'll have to interact with a tiny box in the bottom right, rather than a practical and pleasing window that is large and center on your screen.

They even made battles worse.  Now your units have strange icons and tooltips that provide no use but do clutter up the screen and SIGNIFICANTLY impact the Rome Total War aesthetic.  Battles honestly look like they are a mobile game now with their flashy ""improvements"".

You can cause a settlement to revolt by blockading it for a long time. The AI for the factions seems to be a bit better. Down side the artillery number of units per card is still too small. The game crashes and jams up allot. I have already sent in around 8 crash reports. Yes this computer can handle the game just fine. They also did not tone down the plague and rebel army spam, that increases drastically as you further your empire. It does not hurt your empire its just a annoying micro management headache. They also did not fix the unrealistic rebel armies, that appear after a revolt. They show up with gold experience and gold weapons. Enemy faction spies can still take over your cities via revolt. Oh and the enemy faction one ship blockade spam, as well as from rebel fleets of one ship, is still there too. Not sure why they did not address these issues but they did not. 

If your new to total war and want this game to be your first let me give you some key pointers. The difficulty level in total war games, DO not make your enemies smarter by way of tactics or strategies. The one for the campaign map only increase the number of disasters you get hit with like plagues, the ease of a enemy bribing your agents or armies, and lastly strangling your economy so its very difficult to even put one legion in the field. The battle difficulty is much worse. All it does is drastically lower the morale of your troops, will drastically increasing the moral of the enemy troops. It has nothing to do with tactics, strategy, or history.

I have spent many hours on Rome total war, Medival total war II, Empire total war, Napoleon Total war, and lastly Rome two total war. Rome 2 is solid however things like armies instantly deteriorating due to lack of food, pay, or because it has plague is much heavier for the player then the AI. Also well you can barely maintain full armies with multiple regions. In Rome 2 the AI can maintain multiple full armies with only one lousy settlement/region.

Caeser III birthed my love for ancient Rome, my father helped expand it, and Rome Total War helped cement it into my soul. That game couldn’t have come at a better time, I got it for Christmas the same year I was given my first box of Warhammer models and paint after lusting for that hobby for months. I was only 10, and it was a dream to build and paint model armies then hop into Rome to see my imagination be brought to (virtual) life.

That being said.. I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The UI is not only a downgrade but absolute dog sh*t and I just can’t imagine myself ever getting used to it. The original could have been improved but that’s not at all what they’ve done here. They’ve hidden most info behind various buttons and clicks instead of displaying as much as possible at once because the developers clearly had the mobile version in mind when making this. I really hoped they implement a new UI for desktop with an option to switch between the two. If not, then I really hope an improved UI can implemented somehow through a mod in the future. 

Speaking of which, I tried downloading a few simple mods from the Steam workshop that replaced the unit icons with up-scaled versions of the originals. This for some reason disabled achievements – never had this problem in previous Total War games. 

Oh, and I’ve noticed that they for some reason cranked the music volume way louder than the battle sound effects. Lowered the music volume substantively yet the battle sounds are still incredibly quiet. To the point where I think the devs deliberately muffled/muted them. Why?? I almost want to make a video comparing the audio of the original vs the remaster. It’s incredibly noticeable to anyone that has recently played the original. 

But what really grinds my gears and prompted me to post this review is an absolutely infuriating bug/glitch I just encountered. I was playing the Alexander expansion pack and laying siege to a settlement. Everything was going great in battle – I had my entire army positioned and ready to strike as soon as my men busted through the gates with a battering ram. They succeed, the enemy began to charge out into my trap, and then suddenly the game told me I was defeated. That I had lost the battle before it even truly began. With zero casualties on either side. WTF?? (Check my screenshots)

Heartbreaking.

The only things that really changed are the graphical interface (Which is now busted as fuck - really, who tested this game? Since when do you think it is OK NOT to see immediately how your town is doing financially?) And the new building system is incomprehensible. You used to be able to click on a town and within 2 seconds you knew what was up. Right now, you need a manual, a compass, sacrifice your firstborn and then you might be able to understand. This will definitely attract exactly 0 new players. Absolute disgrace. And the other features are lacking, too. The AI controlled opponents got a teensy upgrade (they are still dumb as a box of rocks though). 

For some very strange reason also, your units start in ""run"" mode by default in the battles, so you have to search for days for the button that disables that unless you want to run your units into the ground and exhaust them.

1. Lack of a Multiplayer Campaign
2. Movement inside towns is still completely random. Units will wander off into the wilderness, navigation and micro on city squares is non existent basically.

It was the summer of 2006 and the moment I launched the game I started up the Teutoburg Forest historical battle. I didn't know quite what I should be doing but I tried my hardest to save my units from the Germans. I recognized how fun the game was in an instant. After launching my first campaign, I became an immediate fan. The time period was my favorite, the campaign map and real time battles were unique and cool, and the soundtrack was epic (I'll never grow tired of it).

 I've been a fan of Total War ever since, but after several years of Rome I moved onto Medieval II and have struggled to go back. While the game was great at the time, I recognized flaws that existed within the game. In some regards it stopped being fun. I thought units broke too quickly and easily, the pathfinding was terrible, the AI needed work, etc. With the announcement of Rome Remastered I had hoped we would get more than just a visual overhaul but some technical love as well to bring the game up to modern standards. Most regrettably, that was not to be.

While the graphics of the game look great, most of the improvements I had expected failed to come. In my first town battle, I almost lost because of pathfinding issues. The AI is still the same. There is too much delay when trying to issue commands. I think the new UI is actually worse than the original. When things like this should have been prioritized, instead the Merchant was added. It's disappointing to say the least. The game just doesn't live up to modern standards. I have had a hard time enjoying it at all. For these reasons, I wouldn't recommend wasting money on a game that didn't get the attention and respect it actually deserved. I feel duped.

P.S. I think Volound deserves a shout out. The man is a true Total War fan like I have been for so many years. I respect his dedication to the series as well as his willingness to actually criticize Creative Assembly and the games. I think the hardcore fans of the series give Creative Assembly too much leeway sometimes. They have made many mistakes over the years and it seems the community is too willing to let it slide. I don't know if it's because we don't care much or we're just trying to get more people to play the games. Avoiding criticism of CA might help spread the games to new fans in the short term, but in the long term, we're probably doing more harm than good by avoiding the tough conversations and criticism. I love both CA and Total War and want them to be successful. In my opinion, Volound has been one of the best at this even if he seems abrasive at times. It's clearly meant with the best intentions.",1620354184,1620354229,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Some nice touches: 1) when you switch from battle view back to campaign view, it maintains the intensity of the sunlight. So if you played a night battle and get back to campaign view, you'll see Europe at night with cities illuminated by torchlight. 2) Units variation is dependent on the geographical area the recruits have been drawn from. So a legion raised in Numidia will be mostly dark skinned, as opposed to a legion raised in Britannia - awesome touch that shows the cosmopolitan nature of the roman army.

The aim of this Remaster should have been to take the game from 2004 and using all the knowledge, Improvements and advancements in AI. Implement a superior experience worthy of a 2021 release.

There is some nice touches in UI and Camera controls, coupled with a once over on the visuals. However the glaring problems with the AI and path-finding are here all these years later.

The meat of the game has not been improved since 2004 so in conclusion i'm not sure what the point of this release was. It has some great core features that Rome 2 doesn't have but has galling technical limitations the newer games don't have (as much).

You can have a decent time with it and Mods may make this worthwhile but much like it's successor, It's a missed opportunity to rejuvenate a classic.

[b]All the good? No. A small village in Gaul is still resisting the might of Rome Total War Remastered.[/b]

I am with these people. A minority. There was / is a competitive and casual multiplayer fanbase. Some of them still play Rome Total War 1 despite the aged visuals.

For this Remastered version I have few hopes that this minority is strong enough to justify developer ressources to fix some crucial aspects of the game

[u]- there is no more a global chat lobby[/u]
I have no clue if this is a legal thing or what but in fact this development is something that begun with Empire and never reverted. We need no admins or mods for a global chat but I can understand if this raises some legal concerns of being an unmanaged space.
Makes community and clan building impossible. You cannot see who is online or get in touch with people outside the hosted game. Not to anyone outside your Steam's friendlist. Check Rome 1 for the differences. I helped with a global survey to bring it back for Rome 2. No help. 

[u]- the multiplayer has (known) stability issues[/u]
just as the original this game today and back in the time of GameSpy, even worse at the moment has stability and sync issues that prevent any fun of playing it in multiplayer*

SimoneCA: ""The team is aware of the current issues in multiplayer battles and they will be investigated.""
*raised an official support ticket with all the trumpets but no feedback from Devs after 1 week.

[u]- Choose a side. Army or hosted game chat[/u]
You cannot have two things at a time. Either pick your army or use the chat - only with joined people

[u]- Start a Battle OR Chat[/u]
Either you can choose to be ready up for the multiplayer battle while waiting for the others or choose to chat. You cannot have both anymore.
There is plenty of wasted screen space on the left as the main menu cannot be used anyway. It is bad UX. 
GL HF 

It is really sad that multiplayer needs - apart from a not existing multiplayer campaign, which is for complete different audience, is put low on the list. Once again. There is no hope. I will return it.

This game is made for modders and people that can sink their time into a singleplayer (or perhaps anytime a coop campaign)

The good
- The visuals are a huge step up, I'm actually amazed at the level of detail that was able to be brought to such an old game, though soldiers can appear too skinny sometimes.
- All the new features are fairly decent, aside from a few things that need improvement. The ability to be able to turn off new improvements at your will and customize between old and new is very nice.
- The AI appears to be a tiny bit better in field battles(though sieges is another story)
- The new camera and controls are amazing. The old control set is just really outdated and bad - But for those that like it, you can set the default classic controls if you wish.
- Being able to scale UI is god sent, though it would be better if we could select what is able to be scaled.
- The affects of buildings, traits etc are made much more clear and understandable, a big improvement compared to the original.
- For the most part the new UI isn't too bad, it takes a while to get used to, but a lot of it makes sense. It could be streamlined a little more, as certain things can take a few too many clicks and are positioned in odd places.
- New unit balance is fairly decent(aside from archer balance)
- The map overlay system is awesome!
- Merchants originally felt a little weird being added, but after playing with them it makes map resources more useful, it needs some balancing though.
- It's a lot rarer to have many small armies being sent at you by the AI, now there's multiple large stacks! :P
- Squalor isn't as severe in the remaster, but can still be a pain in the butt if you don't control it.
- Steam workshop support straight off the bat! Already a tone of mods!
- Performance on my build is buttery smooth for the most part!


The bad
- Battle AI can be fucky, especially in siege battles. The pathing appears to be worse than the original, AI patrolling back and forth on roads dying to your towers, your own units stop chasing enemy units near walls. Enemy sending 1 - 2 units at a time into your whole army defending. AI committing to utilizing their 5 siege rams, 3 siege towers, despite there being holes in the walls made previously by their artillery.
- While the AI appears to merge armies better in the remaster, but it doesn't exactly know what to do with them. The AI rarely attacked my field armies, or armies inside forts....but would constantly sent 2 - 3 stacks to siege a settlement(On very hard difficulty). 90% of my battles were sieges. I've seen instances of AI loading onto boats, sailing a little and dropping back off where they were just picked up from in the same turn lol
- Diplomacy AI isn't much improved - AI will do some weird stuff like offer an alliance, then on the same exact turn attack you. End game becomes a breeze with the ""bribe"" option. Just pay off large enemy armies coming to attack you!
- As stated above, the UI isn't overly bad, but could use some refinement as it can make somethings more tedious than need be.
- Campaign map appears too vibrant, even though there is a slider in settings to adjust, even at lowest it doesn't seem right.
- While above I said the merchant was a good add, it really needs balancing. Once I reached mid game on long campaign, I just spammed out merchants, sent them to the East and South, each merchant was pulling 1000 - 3500 per turn with the highest tier resources. Made me rich, too fast.
- The UI can lag out randomly sometimes on campaign map. 

Conclusion

Basically for its price the remaster offer you:
- You can run the game in modern resolution without additional work to do
-- However the UI scaling is nonexistent, and playing in high resolution is not the best experience
- Brand new UI, which is probably made for tablets and original UI was way more informative and easier to use
- Slightly enhanced graphics, about on the level of Medieval 2
- There are some ""balance enhancements"" that do not really make the game balanced. If you look for balance, you should look into mods.
- Knowing how CA works lately I'm sure that the game will not have any support and neither UI nor balance will be fixed.

I've heard a lot about people for whom the game doesn't perform well and they experienced issues running the game. That obviously sucks, for me it runs fine though.

If you have played the original and think about buying this game. Look up some videos to understand how it changed. At first for example, I found the new UI frustrating, now Ï learned it and it works ok. In many ways it's better imho, in some ways it's worse. The biggest issue I have with the new ui, is that you can't see the tax rate of a settlement, when you have the settlement lists scroll open. Other than that, it just takes some time to get used to.

Pathfinding did improve overall. But it's a 2 steps forward 1 step backwards scenario. Some things have improved, some minor issues have popped up in place of this. Also this takes some time to get used to. Try different things with units {especially in cities) to find out what works. Also it's recommended to play on large unit scale. I play on huge (at least the one above large, with 160 men in a standard infantry unit), and it works fine for me.

The AI has improved behaviour. Also this is 2 steps forward, one step back in my opinion. It's harder to cheese it in this game, so I think it's a bit better.

The graphics I think are great, compared to the old one. I like the 'cartoony' style. This was also the style of the original and I think it's nice that there is an option to use 'realistic' colours. It makes the units look cooler, but not too realistic, which is what I expect from Rome Total War.

All in all, it's not a 'new game', so if you like the graphics of the newer total wars, and that is really important to  you, don't buy it. If you like a fun game and want a different experience from the newer games, you could buy it.

Believe  me, having played strategy games for about 20 years, I know how to manage my expectations with a new release or a project such as this one. I was not expecting them to completely overhaul the game and gave us a new game with new units, new mechanics or new infrastructure - city building. I was hoping they would streamline the  old game and fix some of the bugs. I hate to write this review, because there is  good bit that has been done here to improve graphics, but the game is very buggy, at least for me. The path-finding on the battle maps are terrible. When you order the units to move straight, the units in the center move forward, but the left and right flank start turning toward their respective direction, they don't move in a straight line. Every desert battle I have had(mainly with Egypt), the weather is been raining and cloudy - really CA and Feral, in the desert, I have severe thunderstorm, every time without exception? the strategic map of course has improved graphics, but even there, there are lots of drawback. Many have already mentioned them in their review, so need to repeat the disastrous UI, or the fact that city/town ribbons often cover resources that are next to those towns. Merchant mechanic is very buggy, often merchants standing on a tradable resource stays idle, no matter how much you move him around. Back to the battle map, in terms of visibility of units, this game is a huge step back comparing to the old game. In the old game, I could easily distinguish my type of units on the battle map (archers vs spear infantry vs heavy infantry), not in this game. Units actual sizes are so small, it is hard to tell what they  are, unless you really zoom in , narrowing your field of vision during the battle. Another broken mechanic which used to work just fine is the assignment of offices. Every turn my characters are assigned an office, immediately, the assignment is lost and senate takes it back. There is no reason for it that I could find. As of right now, if you have the old version and it is working for you, I would not recommend this game, even for the half price of 15 bucks.

What can I say it's Rome 1 but looks better with some updated mechanics. But if you don't want them you can just turn them off in-game (it gives you this option) so you can just play Rome 1 with the better visuals. The one thing I wish they did (modders will likely do this in the future) is in the remastered mechanics version the number of troops you hire in a unit doesn't come out of the settlement population in a 1:1 ratio.

BUT - there is one major flaw in the remaster that prevents me from recommending it: the pathfinding. Somehow my units keep finding the most obtuse way to the point I set. For instance, in my most recent siege I ordered a unit to move forward just a hair. The back line would be standing where the front line was before. And yet, the AI determined the shortest distance was to go all the way around the section of buildings beside it. This entailed going back to the wall, walking around the perimiter, moving to the center (next to the enemy who I had not advanced on yet!) AND THEN back to the point.

Beyond that, sometimes I will set a line of units with one of my flanks butting up against an obstacle. When I lay it out, everything looks fine. But as soon as I let go and my units start to move, that flanking unit decides there actually isn't enough space and moves to the opposite flank (without even having the grace to face the same directions as my line).

These are fundamental issues that should have been weeded out early in the development process. The fact that they remain shows either a complete lack of care or a total incompetence when it comes to game design. These were not issues that existed in the original version of this game, so I have to assume the pathfinding was rebuilt to actually be worse than it was 20 years ago. I feel the need to emphasize that a ""glitch"" like this can compromise an entire battle, and battles can take hours in this game.

This is completely unacceptable. Until the time that this game gets patched (and I have the sinking feeling it just won't) you should pick up and play the original instead. The game still runs on Windows 10 for me, but crashes occasionally. But I promise, occasional crashing is FAR less frustrating than watching your units fail and fail again to execute on simple instructions.",1620261565,1620261565,False,3,0,0.505766451358795166,0,True,False,False

Simply put if you wish to play Rome on a modern OS this is the way to go. I've played the original on and off over the years and yes it works okay on Windows 7, getting it to work on Windows 10 is nearly impossible and I even have the CD version. But besides that this version has so many quality of life improvements (quick saves during end turn battles, projectile range cones, tactical map, campaign map rotation, diplomatic success chance, etc.) that to list them all would be staggering. I cannot and would not take anyone who says ""the original is better!"" seriously, especially when virtually everything new can be toggled on/off.

That said there are some downsides. The new Campaign Map UI is functional, but seems cumbersome and poorly laid out in some regards (recruitment & construction). Frankly this is one area where the original may be better. City pathfinding seems worse, but honestly it's always been bad so hard to definitively say if it's better or worse. Also there are some new bugs - for me audio from the campaign map playing while in battle. But other then that I've only had one CTD.

This is a beautifully touched up version of the original Rome 1 total war, and arguably the best Total War game. It adds a bunch of tweaks that make the game better and more challenging.

I also hope they continue to improve upon what they have here, to make the original framework shine even more than the original. The negative reviews are a bit confusing because I have not yet experienced any CtDs or bugs. Nor have I experienced any path-finding issues that aren't an aspect of most total wars - especially the original Rome 1 (that being said, if they improved the path-finding - the game would be even better). Furthermore, I have had no problems with the UI, although - sure - they could indeed improve it. It has taken a bit of adjusting from the original game's UI to the new UI, and improvement would always be welcomed by myself. Lastly, I haven't had any issues with the new controls - the new controls handle just like a modern Total War game and the game looks just like a modern Total War game. This is everything we loved about the original Rome 1 Total War, but with vastly improved controls, graphics, and touched up features. It is a blast.

CURT OPPINION 8/10.
Now about pros and cons. I won't describe all pros and cons that were heritaged from the original, only changes.
PROS
+ Wonderfull graffics. Game looks really cool with new models and textures. 
+ Unit and faction reballance. Now game became more interesting when Greece, and several factions survive pretty long and even outmatch AI Brutii. 
+ New camera and battle UI. Firing arches are the thing I was missing.
+ Modern difficulty rating. Now as in modern TW's on higher difficulty AI has lowered upkeep for units so you would face stronger armies. 
+ Good stability, no crashes
+ High modability and support for modders
+ Trader agent
+ Some parts of campaign UI. Like moving followers between generals
+ Diplomacy becan slightly better. At least AI often offers a protectorate and I haven't seen yet ""please don't attack, or we will attack""
+ Rised max faction cap. Modders now could do more factions.

CONS
- Battle and pathfinding AI. It become even worse than in the original. AI can simply hold his army near your tower or archers doing nothing and taking casualties. While pathfinding AI now so bad that in 1/4 of situations youjr troops would do anything but not what you ve just ordered them
- Campaign UI. It's bad and unintuitive. You have to do a lot of clicks to do things that in the Original you could do with one click. Especcially assassins. While in RTW you can order him with one click in the Remaster you need to do FOUR FREAKING CLICKS AND A BRAINSTORM TO UNDERSTAND HOW DOES THIS S**T WORKS. Buildings and recruit pannels are also bad, they are so small that on my laptop I can hardly define units on it.
- Family tree. I don' know what for they separated it into two sections one is exceptionally awkward and manageble and one cool classical style but useless. 
- No new units and factions. It's even a bit funny that Numidia and Thrace got their own intros but kept their circumcised unit roasters of one and a half units.
- No wonder videos

NOT GOOD NOR BAD
+- Gamma. It's a bit painfull and I've managed to make it better for me, but personally I think original gamma and style were more aesthetic. 
+- Intros. New intros are cool but old intrors were more epic. Especcialy Julii, I can't stop loughing when looking on a general on the chair that looks like a typical Russian petty criminal.",1620250151,1620250151,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

God forbid you should try to move a unit down a city street in a siege, and barbarian towns are a nightmare.

The diplomacy overhaul has put some fun new diplomacy mechanics, but the AI is so abusable that using diplomacy feels like cheating. AI factions will declare war on you and immediately be willing to pay thousands to end the war the same turn.

The UI has to be my least favourite ""improvement"". The old system was dead easy to understand and all in one place. This new system has us clicking on tabs, sub tabs, and tiny interfaces tucked away in the corners of the screen. Gone are the days when you can simply select an agent and then right click on a target. Now you have to fiddle around with a menu the size of a penny in the bottom right corner, and if you don't then the agent will bug out and become unusable.

I was beyond excited when this remaster was announced, but at this point i'm angry that my favourite game of all time has been so shoddily repainted. If you are going to remaster, actually put some polish on it, don't do half a job and call it a day. Call this what it is, Rome: Re-cashgrabbed.

THE BAD [NOT TOO MUCH]
-UI: Yes, the UI is bad. There are too many hidden menus. Things like the actual family tree with heir selection (a role-play feature I love) for example is hidden behind two menus three or four clicks deep literally behind a new family tree table. 
-PATH-FINDING: I never had path-finding issues in the old game, but in the remaster units can get stuck in animation loops, for example phalanx units not forming a phalanx but instead doing some marsh-pit dance while getting killed.
-BLOODLESS BATTLES: Soldiers just sort of all die from heart-attacks. They need to add some gore. At the moment it is like a Disney movie from the 1990's where people faint instead of die. 

THE GOOD [LOADS!]
-AI: The AI is actually a lot more fun on the campaign map. I could always steamroll the AI, which I still do, but now it puts up a fight. Maybe it just caught me off guard. But the Seleucids had me fighting hard as Egypt in the first 10 turns. Then they rolled over and died, but was still fun. 
-SQUALOR: Towns no longer go crazy for no reason. Riots are still possible, but it is not as unpredictable as in the past. The main reason for unrest is still squalor, but I no longer need to exterminate the big cities every few years as in the past.
-DIPLOMACY: It is actually functional! I know, I am almost scared to type it so that I do not jinx it, but yes, it works. The AI does not just say no or demand ridiculous deals. Factions are open to convincing and you can sue for peace, which they will accept if you try hard enough.
-UNITS/BATTLES: The units look great. And so far I have not seen giant armies of pharaohs or too many pajama dudes.

I am not saying that the Remaster is wholly bad, &, I am in-part writing this negative review in the hope that C.A. & Feral will take action to address some of the things mentioned.

First, I'll list the good things about the Remaster:
 -- The new camera.
 -- The new graphics.
 -- The pretty stable performance. It runs very well (maxed-out apart from shadows) on my system, even though my GTX 
     1060 is below the reccomended specifications.

Now, there are a litany of problems with the game.

U.I. ISSUES
 -- You cannot issue orders to spies & assassins by right-clicking. I hope that this will be patched.
 -- You cannot see enemy siege equipment in campaign, before a siege battle.
 -- On the battle-map, you cannot see how your units have been upgraded from looking at the in-battle unit-cards.

There is the slightly broader issue that the new U.I. is entirely out of style with the original, and, in many ways technically inferior to it.

For more information, go and watch the very short video by Dolfy: ""I was told this UI is 'super intuitive' and that I need to get used to it.""

-- Wonder cut-scenes have been removed from the game.
-- The senate video has been removed from the game.
-- When Mount Etna erupts on the campaign-map, there is no longer any lava.

There are many other minor issues, which can hopefully be fixed relatively easily. Such as:

 -- Not all keys are re-bindable (ridiculous for a 2021 game).

Another important issue is the sound in the game. It is very poor.
The audio mixing in Rome Remastered is massively different from the original.

the sound of marching troops has been changed, and greatly reduced in volume.
the sound of projectiles has been changed, too.
in general, the music is far too loud, and the sound effects, far too quiet

It's so bad, that changing the audio levels in the 'music' menu is not really enough to fix it.

It's definitely a huge change from the original game's audio.

This should be changed as a priority.

There are, however, two major things which needed to be done to make this Remaster worth it:

 -- The campaign & battle A.I. needed to be overhauled, so that it was up-to-date with 2021 standards.
 -- And, path-finding needed to be completely fixed.

These two things are the elephant in the room.

I received the RTW original many years ago on CD-s as a Christmas present, the best I have ever received. I played the original and countless of mods, for example: Total realism, DarthMod, Europa Barbarorum, etc. I also played many other Total War games. In short I know what I am talking about, when I compare these products. 

This game is simply very bad. It is a demastered version of RTW.
To be honest, hard to find anything which is an advancement compare to the original. The battle graphic is better, units look nicer, but this is the only one I can think of, or maybe the merchants, but they are practically useless (My income and army was growing significantly after an hour anyway). 
Negatives? OMG, let's start with ridiculously counter intuitive interface. It's normal to spend some time to get used to a new interface, but even had been playing hours I couldn't figure out where to find find the diplomacy panel, a list of my agents, or my family members holding position in the Senate. And no, I won't open the wikipedia, as these basics should be easy to find and to use and not being hidden somewhere. The campaign map looks like a map made for children to educate them on the geography of Europe. Optimisation isn't good either, with a much above recommended gamer laptop, loading time is way too long.
All in all, the useless, counter intuitive interface on its own ruins the game, the bugs and other minor problems are just countless cherries on the cake.

I have always been a huge Total War fan, starting with the original Rome game. I've logged an embarrassing number of hours as a kid, and it's starting to look like history is going to repeat itself.

If you genuinely enjoyed the first Rome game but are deterred from the dated title, pick this up. If you're a fan of strategy games (It's turned based for non combat, and rts for battles) but never tried the original, I would say this is worth the buy. 

+Updated graphics and small quality of life adjustments
+A few new things, like the merchant unit. Comes with handy automanage if you're not interested!
+I missed the pre-battle speeches :')
+Option to auto unlock all factions from the launcher, great if you dont want to regrind
+Was the tactical map a thing before? I cant remember but I like it!
+AWH YEAH GIRL, WORKSHOP SUPPORT
+Pretty music lets me achieve zen as I dance on the graves of my enemies

-AI Still seems a little simple, lower difficulties are a breeze, especially for the roman factions. Mods will most likely address this
- To expand on the above (Im really grasping for straws) It's a little too easy to use brute force, no actual tactics necessary beyond horses having allergic reactions to spears.
-Map animations are a liiiiitle slow. Gotta go fast booooi
-No technology research like the newer Total Wars, if you're into that. It is entirely population based.
-Gaul had the GAUL to demand their territories back in a war they were losing. Not an actual negative, I just wanted to make the pun.

4.8/5. Will update with more as I notice more! :)

The Bad:
-Pathfinding still needs work, sometimes noticeably worse than the original, only in sieges from what I can tell so far
-The campaign UI is subjective. I like how some things are more streamlined and others are blocked behind unnecessary amounts of menus. I think it's a step in the right direction, but there's lots of wasted space and needless buttons that it probably could be fixed either in an update or two or mods.
-One crash so far which ideally will be fixed but I've heard of worse from other users

I knew going into it that it was just base RTW with a new coat of paint; no overhauled pathfinding, no new units and still scuffed diplomacy etc. To give credit where credit is due, many of the small problems with the game have been addressed like unit rebalancing, making the minor and emergent factions playable and touching up diplomacy. However this is about where my compliments end.

OK. As a guy who like to play multiplayer, about 80& of my games have desynced right out of the gate which from the get go means that like half of the game is unplayable (as a fairly big multiplayer guy). Quick loading has crashed my game the 5 times I have instinctively done it. The new UI has various elements I really like but for each addition I like, there is one I don't like. The recruitment and building buttons are in wierd places and creates needless movement from oneside of the ui to the other. Base Romes UI was far from perfect and this is different, not better and arguably worse in many regards.

All of this I could accept up until yesterday where my Carthage campaign, which was going really well, became unplayable after I ended turn on turn 28 and it was stuck on the Julii's turn. Then after after reloading multiple times, it would just get stuck on Egypt. This was a real knife in the back.

I really want this game to be good, and it seems as if Feral are listening to the playerbase, but in its current state I cannot recommend this game in its current state.

It isn't flawless and there are certainly some things I'd wished to be changed, but there are some good benefits that the remaster brings to the table.[/h1]

Currently I am in the middle of an Armenian Hard long campaign and am nowhere near close to be doing done so some of what I say here may be incorrect.

There's also a decent selection of folks that were hoping for new content (factions) for the game. I share their desire but I'm also not surprised nor particularly upset about this. After all, they were just taking the very old original game and just modernizing it.

[h1]The pros:[/h1]
-[b]Modern hardware support.[/b] My CPU/GPU are Ryzen 9 5900X & MSI RTX 3080 Suprim X. In the original Rome I'm lucky to match my monitor's refresh rate (120Hz) in medium-sized battles on 1080p. I play on an ultrawide monitor (3440x1440). The remaster not only has support for these resolutions but very high unit count battles play well and I easily match my monitor's refresh rate. It also has proper borderless window support. There's honestly a lot to say about this point but the main takeaway is that it is extremely beneficial.
-[b]Campaign AI improvements.[/b] This is multi-faceted. Anyone who is a long time player of Rome knows there are just certain areas that the AI struggle to move through, such as where Armenia borders with Scythia. This meant that AI in the region would be relegated to Africa, Egypt, modern-day Turkey, and the middle east. Theoretically, if an AI captured all of those regions, it would almost never cross into present-day Russia in order to get to Europe (this was coupled with the AI almost never using fleets to load an invading army). The AI aren't perfect strategic masterminds, but they are definitely more aggressive now, and I have found myself surprised on a few occasions on their attacks (something that normally didn't happen in the original Rome). There's also diplomacy improvements. I actually had a faction demand payment or else they'd attack me. When I refused, they attacked. Who would have guessed. This almost never happened to me in the original (happened once I recall). AI diplomacy is a bit predictable and sometimes overly optimistic, but generally it's better over the original in my opinion.
-[b]Battle AI pathing improvements.[/b] Anyone who is a long time player of the original knows that sometimes the AI (even on the hardest difficulties) can be a bit stupid and just casually march straight into your units (rather than charge at the final moment), or sometimes have awkward pathing up to your units (seems to be relevated to elevation, I think the AI logic wants to fight on even elevation, which in execution leads to clunky pathing). Pathing improvements are also noticeable in in sieges. Town squares are NOTORIOUSLY terrible to navigate units in for the original game. It feels like the town square (in the original Rome) has exactly 1 AI pathing node in the center. Any long time players of the first game know this pain: often when you try to move to or attack a unit in the center of a town square, your own units will take a road alongside the center and then bank a hard 90 degree turn to reach the center. The remaster flows a lot better, I can definitely tell there are more AI pathing nodes for them to take. On this point, though, there is something the remaster didn't touch which I'll mention in the cons section.
-[b]New faction bios.[/b] Minor. Specifically in reference to the original game's ""unplayable"" factions. The bios weren't there originally, and now they are. Cool. Also they added a launcher option to unlock all factions, a minor touch to streamline the process.
-[b]Modernized UI.[/b] I struggled with putting this one here in the pros. Myself and a lot of players do not like some things about the new UI, but I think a lot of the distaste comes from just being so used to the original. If you've never played Rome, or have barely touched another Total War, then I think the remastered's UI will be more intuitive for you. For everyone else, though, it feels a bit clunky. I consider it a modernized UI because it tries to consolidate information into discernible categories. Not that I agree with the execution, but I can see that was the intent.
-[b]Unit balance.[/b] Not a lot of balance changes happened here, but the ones that did happen I consider for the best. Overall a plus.
-[b]Rebels use agents.[/b] Minor, but overall a plus.
-[b]Steam workshop mod support.[/b] Always a plus.
-[b]You get the original game when you buy the remaster and if you own the original game the remaster is 50% off.[/b]
-[b]Togglable game settings for remastered versus original.[/b]


[h1]Things I am meh about:[/h1]
-[b]The new merchant agent.[/b] It is new, so that's nice, but execution feels a bit lukewarm. Sure, there are new mechanics involved and you can manipulate resource nodes or trade, but it just doesn't quite feel that fleshed out. You can use the agent to monopolize trades nodes (either your own or another faction's) but seemingly it is almost never worth the effort. You stand to gain a lot more by just using the agent to trade with a city.
-[b] Public order and squalor.[/b] Feral said they reworked the squalor mechanic. Any long time player knows that squalor was the original game's main population control mechanic and unrest source. In the remastered version it just feels like they just moved the scaling unrest source to ""distance from capital"". In the original game distance to capital wasn't a major factor of unrest, it was always squalor. In my Armenia campaign there is a city in Turkey that has a whopping 50% unrest from distance to capital. In the original that would be significantly less.
-[b]Loading screen splash art.[/b] Overall I much prefer the original's red-and-black silhouette art, but this doesn't feel like enough of an issue to list it as a con. Again, mods maybe? :)

[h1]The cons:[/h1]
-[b]The UI.[/b] I already touched on it above but would I be remiss if I didn't vent my frustration here. Just wish there was a way to revert to the original UI. Mods maybe? :) (I've found that 110% or 120% UI scaling helps a lot).
-[b]Siege AI pathing.[/b] AI navigation is still really clunky around walls and gates. It is like this in the original game but I had hoped it would be improved in the remaster.
-[b]Some general portraits.[/b] A bit of a minor point but I don't know why they did this. You know those meme images where someone takes a face and uses the Photoshop drag tool to warp the face into a frown, or a grimace? And it looks a bit stretched or funky? It feels like that is what they did to Tiberius Brutus for the House of Brutii. I don't know why they bothered. The original was better. The faction bios also were changed; they feel a bit sandblasted of character.
-[b]The AI logic for the skirmishing mechanic is noticeably worse.[/b] In the original game I found the skirmishing mode to be extremely reliable. AI would always prioritize avoiding melee and would reliably maneuver. They would only be caught if run down by cavalry or flanked or outran. In the remastered version I've found my missile cavalry stupidly letting infantry units charge them (and then retreating but losing men in the process).
-[b]Unit portraits are worse and less unique.[/b] The original game had a certain charm where it felt like every unit in the game had its own stance on the portrait card. The remastered unit portraits feel like each unit is standing up for a mugshot.",1620197479,1620197512,True,0,0,0.498812347650527954,0,True,False,False

The Good:

- It's a wonderful looking remaster. While it certainly retains the simple art style that makes it reminiscent of its original roots, there are times I find myself going (if cynically), ""Wow, that almost looks as good as Rome 2!""

- It's Rome 1. It's a great game. If you liked it then, you'll probably like it now. It's still the same game at the end of the day, even with its changes. If you're new to Total War, this entry does present itself as a good starting point. It's simple enough to grasp; good-lookin' enough to enjoy the battles.

- Some of the Combat UI changes are very welcomed, bringing in elements from more modern titles that give the gameplay a feeling of being current and not so dated (tactical map, ranged overlays, etc.)

The Bad:

- I'm not a huge fan of the campaign interface. I don't think it's as awful as some folks are complaining, but it is rather annoying that it takes 2-3 more clicks to do something so simple as que up a building or unit.

- Factions are still rather imbalanced. Rome 1 was this way and true to form, this didn't change with the Remaster.

Personal Gripe (More Bad):

- I truthfully cannot recall if this was an element of Rome 1, as it's been so long since I've played, but if it was, then this needed fixed. Either way, it's rubbish. After a few long campaigns, I've become increasingly annoyed that when laying siege and successfully starving out the defenders, the AI attacks my besieging force and makes *ME* invade the city. The defenders do not come out. In some situations, the defenders run about a bit, and the game declares a draw. If I deny the draw, I'm forced to take the city while they defend. If I end the battle at a draw, the AI gets to attack me AGAIN AND AGAIN that same turn, and keep forcing a ""draw"" when I don't assault the walls. So no matter the case, in any scenario, I have to assault the city on their terms. They're the ones who cannot hold the city anymore. I don't care for an ""auto win"" for them starving like in some Total War games, but at the least they should come out from the walls. They're the ones trying to leave. Logic is broken here.

Overall:

- I say the game is worth it. Rome 1 is still a masterful classic, and at worst, you're getting a much nicer-looking edition, with updated combat UI that really is worth the while. If we're being reasonable about expectations here, it hit the mark.

If any further Total Wars get the remaster treatment, I expect a bit better. But this is a good start!

885970,91455634,76561198122246487,0,4,23611,0,1927,1704004214,"I'm torn on whether to give this a positive or negative review, but since I do play it, I feel obligated to recommend it. If I could, I'd give it 3/5 stars. 

I should make this clear, I ONLY play the Barbarian Invasion DLC, no base game or Alexander, so everything I say relates to Barbarian Invasion. 

What's good?:
1: Visually, It still pales in comparison to modern titles, but that's to be expected with it's age. That being sad, its a gorgeous looking remaster. 

2: The new diplomatic mechanics and map overlay really tick my strategy inch. If you're like me, and you just like staring at the map until it becomes one color. Then this improvement was well needed, allowing me to visually plan my next campaigns. 

3: Merchants add a new perspective to the game play that enhances the original. But it's such a pain to build up this awesome tradesman only for him to be bought off by a rival faction. 

Now for the bad; yes, there's that little good.

1: Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game in anyway, that's why I recommend it. But, most of the stuff that is good was already here before the remaster. 

2: Don't even get me started on the bugs, crashes and error reports. By the time of writing this, I've had 7 crashes in a single campaign.
For example,. I just lost an entire 148 turn hard/hard play through as the WRE, where I successfully killed off the Lombards, Franks, Huns, Vandals and the alemanni tribe north of the Alps.
You're probably asking, how did I lose? Was it my economy? Did my dynasty go extinct? No, a Celtic army bugged the game so turns couldn't advance. Near Samabrovia (if I spell it correctly) they kept trying to hide in the woods, resulting in them phasing in and out of reality constantly. After waiting over 4 minutes for the turn to end, I re-logged and reloaded over eight times trying to fix it. 
Still, it's bugged, and I'm forced to restart all over again. 

3: That fact that I got this game on sale (14.99) is the sole boon of this story. If I had spent 30 dollars for a bugged remaster, I'd be furious. 

Overall, get this game, but only if it's on sale, DO NOT give this company more money than they deserve. As a loyal Total War fan, I leave my review.

And I have to say: I've NOT been disappointed!!!

This game is amazing!!! Taking everything good from the original game and merging it PERFECTLY with more modern TW mechanics without subtracting anything!!

- Both campaign and battles look absolutely amazing
- The UI is only slightly different and very easy to adjust to.
- New unit size makes battles even more epic ALTHOUGH the pathing with this declared ""experimental"" unit size is a bit dodgy in settlement battles
- MOD workshop!!!!!!! provides us with infinite more possibilities should you somehow get bored of the vanilla game (personally love all the additional settlement mods!)
- New agent mechanics add merchants and makes locating and relocating agents MUCH easier! Almost the only tedious issue from the original game.
- A new campaign icon makes seeing issued Senate Missions unbelievably easy to keep track of!
- Completely revamped tutorial makes learning not just the Remaster, but Total War itself significantly easier!!

The spirits of the dead cry out for blood. I will lead our family in this undertaking. The gods will grant us vengeance.

UI:
I like new UI features in the remaster like this quick overview of cities. However, the way those things are placed is not great in my opinion. You get kind of a mess on the screen and building and recruiting window is quite small comparing to other things.

Merchants: 
Not really my thing, after I am done with current campaign I will probably switch them off.

Battles:
Changes to moving and grouping units are great
AI in my opinion wasn't really improved
Units look much batter(tho you can't expect something as in RTW2 or Warhammer)
Still have that kind of a felling that units move too fast and I don't see anywhere battle speed option

Somehow despite the updated graphics the game's looks also feel like a downgrade to me. The campaign map is overly saturated to the point of cartoonishness, and the empty original battle maps clash with the modern models hard. While the textures are obviously superior, the game looks way less cohesive overall which is immensely disappointing.
The loading screens are also way less stylish, with the elegant black-and-red silhouettes replaced with very goofy-looking concept art, cheapening the overall presentation of the game immensely.

Rome TW (with Roma Surrectum II mod) is my favorite TW to date, and I have played all of the historical ones but Napoleon. Even my little avatar over there is from RS2 mod. I was so incredibly excited for this remaster; updated graphics are cool, but updated controls and more modding possibilities!

Unfortunately the game just doesn't play well. The UI is atrocious, many others have said this, and I am hoping it gets fixed. But the big thing, and the reason most of us play TW, is the battle. Specifically, pathfinding is just god awful. Worse than the original. EVERY battle I have to fight with the pathfinding, or deal with my units not following my orders (like archers walking when I tell them to run, standing still for 5 seconds before they run, cavalry not disengaging when I tell them, even if I use the age-old repeated input tricks.

I don't know if this is just me, but sometimes I'm clicking things on the campaign map and I can hear sounds of stone sliding as if a menu is popping out but seeing nothing on screen. Also, some of the UI buried behind other UI is difficult to navigate through.. maybe if I gave the game more time I'd get used to it but it feels very dissimilar to any other total war game and not intuitive at all. 

The last thing for myself were battles. Commanding soldiers is a chore. It's just not fun. The input feels really laboured and clunky, I press for a unit to attack and it takes 2, sometimes 3 clicks until they actually move - and these clicks aren't in quick succession. 

Overall a pretty unpolished remaster. I appreciate the effort that's gone into bringing the original back to us, and I will consider buying it again if they iron out some of the problems.

I will say that I might be a little biased in favor of the older games. Therefore, I really, really wanted to like this remaster. There are a lot of great things I've found and would love to see more of. However, there are just too many weird decisions and problems that just plague the entire experience. I have absolutely no clue as to who would enjoy playing this. Original purchasers? New players? Therefore, I'll lay out what I liked and disliked about the game so one should have more of an Idea of what they should expect.

Starting with what I like:
   1. The new textures and remodels look great. I've always been a fan of more realism within total war, so I am happy to see more historical designs. Especially units like hastati really needed that kind of facelift. Love the new diverse skins on soldiers within a unit. If one isn't a fan of the new designs, one can just set it to the old stuff, really nice. Additionally, the cities look great, I love just looking around at the little details like parks and outdoor ""restaurants"". Great stuff. Really good job.
   2. Actually, I've found the battle AI to be more... interesting. I've found it to be more aggressive and thoughtful on how they would attack and then retreat. Additionally, the AI has been using its formations a lot better, especially when holding a central line against multi- directional attacks, moving units into sub groups to save a flank against an enemy. Really dynamic battles when against Greek factions. Cool stuff.
   3. Any other gameplay change that's not mentioned as a dislike is welcome. Merchants are cool (I think due to them being hampered by UI functionality). Being the first of the entire series, one could say it is a bit sparse on features. Therefore, it is nice to see more creative ideas.
   4. Overall, a pretty solid and polished experience when it comes to the technical side of the game. I was a little worried with the early release of the minimum specs, but I am pleased that the game runs relatively well compared to the original on modern systems. Great job with the whole remastering aspect.

However, these are what kill me inside about the game:
   1. Holy fuck what happened with the UI? Functionality has absolutely been dissolved behind submenus on a foundation that is designed for mobile. I can't tell if I'm just whining that it's different from the original, but there has to be something to be said about things like the family tree being a non-functional JPG to that you're forced to use the list of ALL characters with no visual context. Need to see an acquisition, spy, or assassination chance on a specific unit that you're about to right click? Something like how it worked in the original and later games? No, sorry. Look to the tiny list on the bottom right to see every single option throughout the entire map. These are just two examples on how anti-user this UI is, even putting the actual start of the game behind 2 sub launchers. Ridiculous. Almost a deal breaker. Rip it all out, start over, people have noticed and enough has been said about it. 
   2. The engine renderer is weird? I don't know how to describe this, but the whole graphics engine is funky on how it renders in-game objects. It's like I am looking at a pre-rendered unreal engine scene. Having a resolution scale is really indicative of what a renderer program would look like and having the setting at anything below max gives the entire game a really cheap fuzzy look as if one just threw a bunch of textured rome TW models into an unreal-compatible modeling program. That is the real reason why projectile trails were added, because they'll de-render out of the game without them. Just watch the pop-in on the spears of phalanx units. Especially with how floaty the camera mouse controls are, it's like I'm flying through a scene on an architectural rendering program like lumion. Not really a deal breaker, but it is something that puts me off.
   3. Unit behavior is kinda funky? Feels like pathfinding has gotten a little worse and javelins take longer to fire? kinda funky. More testing is needed on this point, but I won't be the one to do that.
   4. Ok, who soundmixed the game? Someone in your office is TROLLING HARD. Blowing the music up and blasting my ass off just in the menu, or decreasing the battle effects of soldiers clashing to the point where all you hear is OOF, AAHH, BONNK, OUCH. Pretty funny, but also good job if the aim is to decrease the overall satisfying omph and immersive experience.
   5. Being the reason why I stopped playing after 16 hours, the campaign AI is dogshit. Oh my god, maybe I should have put it on very hard, but I thought the campaign improvements would make it more challenging. Having factions not consolidating multiple available stacks to stop me or other factions from steamrolling their undefended empire is just boring. Even when the AI does go on the offensive, its not very fun for the AI to spawn RAT stacks of 2-3 units to flood your lands and fail at taking cites with armies that would never even win against the smallest of a garrison army. The amount of armies and different factions who failed to capture the same REBEL settlement over and over is pretty hilarious, but not cool. Especially the other roman factions who just fail at taking their first settlement and then are just stuck for the rest of the campaign. Hell, I even took Apollonia after the brutii stood outside of it for 20 turns with a half stack, but the they just refused to accept the city even when I tried to give it to them in diplomacy. I guess I'll come back to the game in a while. Fucking sad.

After further reflection, I would pick it up for the $15 price as a returning player. However, I am sad to report that I don't know if I would recommend it at $30 though. Although at the moment it may be sad, everything can be fixed. I don't know what the roadmap is of post-launch support, but I am looking forward to revisiting this experience at a later date. Guys, guys, just fix the UI, and fix the campaign behaviors. Hell, just split the AI remaster choice to have either new battle AI, or new campaign AI. That's it. Please, I really love the care that was put into this game to make it new and I appreciate the general support for the player base.

A Remaster of what many would consider the Golden Age of Total War games is very welcomed and so I immediately hopped aboard what I was hoping would bring some nostalgia back without feeling lacklustre given the age.

And I think Creative Assembly & Feral Interactive did a very good job at giving this game a deserved remaster, updating the game to work much better with newer software and hardware, utilizing the years of game development progress to give the game a nice new coat of textures and visual enhancements while retaining the classical feel of an older game.

Rome: Total War when it released and still to this day is horribly unbalanced. Certain factions and units absolutely dominated, the AI made weird decisions both in combat and in diplomacy, so while the game keeps most of its original gameplay loop, there have been some changes to how the gameplay works, balancing and more sensible changes. Luckily if you want to keep that unbalance and original gameplay, you can turn it off before starting a campaign. Something you often don't see in a remaster title, very welcomed.

There is also the added benefit that you get the original collection of Rome: Total War if you are so inclined to play the original itself. I can appreciate the gesture even if you can no longer buy the original on its own, it does make sense to do this though.

However the game as of now still suffers from some problems, my biggest problem is crashing. Oh, boy are they frustrating, now your mileage may vary but in my case, the game is very unstable and has a tendency to crash and corrupt save files fairly randomly. You'll auto-resolve a naval battle and crash, you'll start a battle and crash, you may finish a battle and crash. It's really frustrating to have to go back sometimes an entire turn when this happens. But this is by far the biggest issue I've seen thus far.

The second issue is the UI. For the love of God, they've butchered my boy. It looks like the mobile port was just transferred directly to the PC. Who in their right mind designed the new UI. You can tell it's a mobile UI since everything is put conveniently so that it's easy to tap expanding buttons, but they failed to adapt it back to PC. The UI is just a huge letdown and I'll genuinely pay money to get the original UI upscaled and remastered. For the love of the roman empire, please fix the damn UI.

So all in all if you can look away from the crashes that should be resolved with bug fixes and the horrendous new UI, I still can recommend the game to both those who played it in the past and those new to the older games in the genre, it's a nice piece of nostalgia that I am sure to enjoy for a foreseeable future. Now, how about an Empire: Total War II?

Because I criticise the game for crashing, I will for transparency list my system specs, I also note that all drivers are up to date, including graphics, windows, chipsets etc. Anything relevant to the game.

The overall quality of the game is severely lacking, poor amateurish school kid level artwork,  limited repetitive loading screens, ugly truly hideous cumbersome UI (a real tedious clickfest) and a garish fluorescent toxic waste effect campaign map.  The original UI was fluid and intuitive this is like wading through mud.  It's vastly inferior to the classic UI, it's obviously designed for touchscreens and not the pc mouse.  Not only is the UI vandalised but the wonder and agent videos have also been discarded,  it's very much a ""streamlined"" version of Rome.

Gone are the iconic abstract soldier silhouettes replaced by low quality primitive cartoon loading screens. The general art style and aesthetic of the game is now a triumph of bad taste. The game now has a very trashy low brow look and feel. The overall effect is to give a cheap low budget, poor quality feeling to the game like a cheap knock off copy rather than an authentic faithful remaster.

I have thousands of hours on the original dvd version and I can say this MOBILE PORT is actually worse in many areas than the old classic.

I'd forgotten they made such better games before where actual combat was calculated, actual projectiles were calculated, and where tactics were far more important that just stat numbers.
Most people don't realize the difference, but when you play any Total War game tthat is Shogun 2 or earlier, you were playing with combat calculations, and not stat number dice rolls. Charges were a risk and rewards, and trying to pull out from a charge was a risk you rarely wanted to take as it gave free hits on your retreating horse units. Projectiles had to actually HIT the target, and it would ACTUALLY hit a shield to deflect instead of some cheap percentage dice roll. Morale actually meant something, and a charge on the rear of a unit was far more scary then some ""push button howl"" ability.
It's so hard to explain, but it's so good to play again. Even if the old game was better with mods, it didn't NEED mods like future total war games did. Even if it has some of the old bugs, is still not as horrible as say, rome total war 2 that had bug like ""higher ground meant less morale"" or ""Tortoise formation actually causes MORE casualties to arrows"". Yeah, the individual soldiers actions being molded individually means they do some stupid things now and then but it's worth every good thing that comes with this old way of simulating battle that Total War has given up on doing.

Trying to retreat my general or rear charge with cavalry inside of a city actually sending the unit the opposite direction into the enemy spears I had been kiting is a nightmare. UI sucks. Pathing somehow 100x worse than any other total war game I've ever played. It's not just the 'hard time getting through a gate pathing either. It's units going in random directions because they can't see the huge gap to run through. Not going to be playing this again for a long time until these issues are fixed.

Update:

I forgot to mention how ridiculous the speed some units is. I appreciate the attempt to make an older TW game feel more responsive but its ridiculous how light spears can accelerate like a Bugatti Veyron regardless of whether they're engaged or not.

This game will grab you by the nostalgia but i got to say it did not dissapoint me.

The graphics are a great improvement on the ol'original and the option between the more vibrant game or less is a great feature.

Even though this game wins you over with nostalgia, some new remodels slightly dissapoint me mostly the Carthaginians, i'll never forget the Iberian Infantry with their round shield and half moon on it, and damm do i miss them.

I have admittedly only played 2.8 hours so I wont comment on the gameplay/battles (I do think they are much better compared to what it used to be) HOWEVER, I can't recommend this game because the UI is just godawful. It takes away from the experience more than you would think. For example, say you wan't to recruit some units. First you click the city, pretty normal, the screen you see is a list of buildings (note this is NOT where you build units), you then click the unit LIST tab, then you click the recruit button. That is 3 button clicks on a hard-to-see background (white background, gold button). HOWEVER there is a button to do it in 1 click! Oh wait its really small and in the corner? Basically for a action that you will be doing multiple times in a single turn, 3 clicks/1 small click is ridiculous. The building menu suffers from the same issue too. There are plenty of other UI issues, for example the alerts tab is frankly stupid, especially since I'd argue the system where a noti falls down is better than everything else like that's in warhammer etc. Now I wouldn't get to upset at Feral given that they are the people who did the Rome ports to ipad, etc. And imo this current UI would be GREAT if it was on an ipad, button it just doesn't work for computer at all.

EDIT: I just remembered this issue, but there is defiantly path-finding issues in both sieges and field battles, units will just randomly stop, for example when you raise/lower pikes, some units will forget all their orders, really throws a wrench in microing units (its not just pikes, I've had cav just stop as well).

When I first jumped in, eager to relive some of my fondest childhood memories, I was somewhat disappointed to find myself in a completely new scenario for a Total War game; having absolutely no idea what to do.

With Rome Remastered I was genuinely perplexed. How do I view my settlement income? How do I monitor public order? Where the hell do I figure out who I can recruit?!

So why am I recommending this game? Because after the first few turns that all disappears, and is replaced by the greatest feeling humanity is gifted with: nostalgia. Suddenly, I'm no longer a 27 year old marketing executive ignoring the pile of washing I still need to hang to dry. Instead I'm back to being a 11 year old kid trying to conquer Gaul without my parents knowing I'm still up.

If Rome Total War was the game that got you into this franchise then buy this game. You'll get a rush of nostalgia.

Yet, yet, the battle system of pre Empire games are pure joy. Meaningful, reasonable, squad and formation based, where your tactics and formations are matters. (tears of nostalgia).

This remaster could be such a great step, such a welcome rejuvenation of the greatest total war game. 

But, it is wasted once again. The line of disappointments from CA, started at Rome 2 seems to have to end.

If you are new or coming from games like Warhammer  it is a vastly different experience that is certainly worth playing. This game, at least the old one, revolutionised total war games and has amazing mechanics that were sadly dropped in later total wars.

they also included several unit balance changes and a new agent type (merchants) but unlike most remasters now a days they dont force this upon you, all balance and camera changes are on toggle switches in the settings, so you can quite easily place literal 2004 Rome TW with brand new graphics and Windows 10 support",1620075213,1620075213,True,1,0,0.503592431545257568,0,True,False,False

This is a preliminary review that I'll update as I play more of the game. While I do not think I've played a sufficient amount of the game to give a well balanced and comprehensive review, I had encountered a specific mechanic/bug which I considered a deal-breaker significant enough to post a negative review sooner rather than later (this was indeed just a mechanic which could be toggled, thankfully).

[b] This review is primarily intended for veterans of the original 2004 Rome Total War, describing changes I consider either positive or negative when comparing RTW to TWRR. [/b]

[*] ++ The game introduces many new tweaks to existing game mechanics that can be toggled on/off, allowing you to benefit from modern game balancing while also having the choice to default to the original mechanics if you'd prefer to play the remaster only for the enhanced graphics....
[*] | -- ... In general there are a lot of settings that I find objectionable in the remake, for which there are surprisingly no ways to toggle them on/off. A few of these I will remark about in this review, with the note reading something along the lines of ""This setting cannot be toggled"".
[/list]

[h1] Pre-release (false) advertising [/h1]
[list]
[*] - There were supposedly new factions added, but this is not true.
[*] - The hard-coded faction cap was supposedly removed, but this is not true.
[/list]

[h1] Graphics and Performance [/h1]
[list]
[*] ++ The graphics are greatly improved. I had never felt bothered by the dated graphics of the original, but this remaster is unquestionably better.
[*] ++ The ability to freely set a cap on the frame-rate (or to set no cap at all).
[*] + Support for 4K (I have no personal experience with this).
[*] ++ The 30GB enhanced texture pack is an optional download, which can be disabled to save disk space.
[*] + Support for modern systems (I have had no personal issues with this for the original game, which ran smoothly on my system).
[*] ? Optimization is still currently unknown, because I haven't fielded full army stacks in multi faction battles yet, nor engaged in sieges of huge cities.
[/list]

[h1] Modding [/h1]
[list]
[*] + (Allegedly) Support for modding (I have no personal experience with this yet)...
[*] | + ...Positive response from the modding community, especially with regards to some of the major modding projects from the original game.
[*] -- (Seemingly) No ability to easily tweak game files for low complexity modding (in the original game you could just navigate to the '\data\' folder and adjusts game mechanics via text files to suit your needs, meaning a very low barrier of entry for modding).
[*] + The hard-coded faction cap has been raised (from 21 to 31 I believe, but I'm not sure).
[/list]

[h1] General remarks [/h1]
[list]
[*] ++/- The soundtrack is kept for this game, unchanged from the original.
[*] ++ There is an in-game wiki which is stored locally. I dislike that it is accessed via the Steam overlay, but other than that this is a great addition.
[*] ++ Modern keyboard layouts for hotkeys, with the option to switch to the classic controls.
[*] --/++ The new UI for both the campaign map and the battle map is much changed, and in my opinion it's a significant downgrade with certain simple actions now requiring multiple clicks where before only a single click was needed (and sometimes no clicks at all). There is no way to revert to the old UI. Time will tell if it is actually pretty decent and this was merely a knee-jerk reaction, or that it really is a downgrade across the board.
[*] + Almost all of the previously unplayable factions have been unlocked, with obvious exceptions such as Rebels and SPQR. This was already possible for players to achieve in the original RTW game, but it required some minor file editing.
[/list]

[h1] Campaign [/h1]
[list]
[*] + Modern camera controls...
[*] | - ...But no way to reset your camera to the default, if you rotated the world map out of the standard 'North = Up' view.
[*] + Modern hotkeys with the ability to toggle classic controls.
[*] + Enslaving a settlement now spreads the enslaved population equally among all settlements, rather than just the settlements with governors. This setting can be toggled on/off.
[*] + Maximum Squalor is now capped at a lower value (I haven't encountered this yet). This setting can be toggled on/off.
[*] -/+ Merging of save and load menus. Double-clicking a save results in loading that save file. Personally I'm not a fan of this, but others might think this an improvement.
[*] + The ability to disconnect unit scale from settlement populations, allowing unit scale to have no effect on the campaign. This setting can be toggled on/off.
[/list]

[h1] Combat [/h1]
[list]
[*] ++ A circle icon above units that give unit information at a glance.
[*] + The ability to set unit scale to 'Extreme', which raises unit sizes by +25% on top of Huge (e.g. a 160 soldier unit goes up to 200 soldiers)...
[*] | + ...Which means that the maximum army size possible for a single stack goes up from 4800 to 6000, allowing you to now actually field a full Roman legion using a single army stack (including auxilia).
[*] + Arrows now have trails, but this can thankfully be toggled on/off. I don't like arrow trails personally, but because of the toggle it's not an issue.
[*] + Modern camera controls, with an option to switch to classic camera controls...
[*] | - ... However, the classic camera controls are not actually the way it was in the original RTW game, as it now has a much more vertical angle. I found this to be off-putting enough to use the modern camera controls over the classic camera controls, even though I preferred how the camera controls were in the original RTW game.
[*] + Modern hotkeys to fine-tune control over units, with the ability to choose between the classic and modern hotkeys.
[*] + The option to get a top-down view of the battlefield if you zoom out far enough...
[*] | - ...Which is unfortunately always-on and activates automatically when you fully zoom out. This setting cannot be toggled.
[*] -- Essential morale tool-tips in combat require mousing over units while holding down the ALT key, whereas in the original game you could just mouse over units for the same effect.
[*] ++ Ranged units now have a cone or circle around them to indicate their area of fire, allowing you to to better judge where and how to position ranged units.
[*] -- It is now no longer possible to rotate entire armies while keeping them in formation whilst they are ungrouped. Instead they always revert to line formation. Only grouped armies can rotate as one.

Though Feral Interactive claims to have fixed squalor issues, from my experience in the game, squalor is still a big problem and, from my constant checks to see why my settlements are falling into the red, it seems that it makes up most of the issues overall. Distance to capital is also higher than I expected.

Playing as a proper Roman and moving my capital to Rome, it's a pain when a relatively close settlement just on the edge of the Italian Peninsula gets a ""Distance from Capital"" penalty of -15%. That's pretty massive for just being that close.

My squalor issues typically range around 30-70% of public order issues, though. And that in itself is pretty massive. Would be nice to see a future patch lowering it down more. I want to play Rome: Total War, not Rome: Total Genocide where I have to exterminate the pop to cull them every time they rise in number a bit.

Another issue I've noticed is in battle. Units seem to move on their own without orders being issued. This may have been a problem in earlier patches of the original, but I know without a doubt that in the latest steam ver. of the original, at least, there is no such problem. I've routinely had my battle line decide to shift itself with certain units just deciding to pull back for no reason (even if not attacked/pushed back; they're melee units too, so they can't skirmish), therefore messing up army cohesion. It's very damning when you form a line, but all of a sudden, when you're focused on winning the flanks, your center decides to yeet open on its own accord, exposing you completely.

This and formations in battles is also an egregious issue. Group commands/formations are terribad. Aside from the unit cards often being randomly meshed around like someone shuffled them, there's also the fact that despite locking formations, units move out of the order you placed them in the line. This makes what would otherwise be a uniform line a zig-zaggy mess that you'll have to fix all over again.

As far as I see it, these are the biggest things plaguing the game at current. If new patches are released to fix them in the future, then I would be pretty pleased. Something like a Rome Remastered: Emperor Edition? lolz

At least the problems, imo, aren't as bad as Rome II upon launch. Just needs a few tweaks here and there. I actually think that the Remastered's rebalances are good. Roman units no longer just steamroll through enemies and I've encountered some pretty difficult battles against barbarian factions, even if forces are about equal.

If the aforementioned issues get fixed and mods on the line of RS, XGM, or EB get rolled out later on, I'd say that the game would be worth the buy. Though, $30 in its current form is a bit too much. I'd recommend for fans of the series to wait until a sale happens or it gets cheaper.

The Bad:
1. Pathfinding is horrendous during sieges. I spent minutes trying to get my units to respond to my commands, getting off/on a wall, going through a gate, or simply falling back to another position. When using units like hoplites it makes it downright unplayable. Sometimes my units would simply stop moving mid way and just sit there so I would have to constantly go back and forth micro managing.

2. The UI is poor. Its not terrible just not great. A lot of the text is very small (I know you can make it bigger) but it is placed in awkward locations and you need to do far too much clicking/sub menus to get basic information on settlements, commanders etc.

3. The map is pretty ugly to be honest. I feel they could have put a bit more work into it.

Witht that said I did like:

1. A smaller map with more streamlined building process. Its nice having the option to play a more bite size version rather than dealing with a massive epic like Rome II all the time.

2. The music is vastly superior in Rome Remastered.

3. Requiring ships to transport troops is a nice touch. While I could see some viewing it as annoying it requires additional planning and strategy to pull off invasions which I appreciate. This included consolidating troops in my empire.

With all that said, the only reason I haven't asked for a refund is that Total War has some of the best modders around and I know they will do a great job here. I feel conflicted because a part of me doesnt want to award Sega for a half baked product which clearly behaves like a tablet game.

A massive nostalgia trip for me, incredible game restored beautifully in HD. It just revitalises the original- don't expect a drastically changed game, but definitely worth getting (on sale) if you liked the original even a little bit.

Positives:

- The map looks beautiful (particularly campaign but battles as well)

- The game seems to run really smoothly, at least for me

- The new intros, from what I've seen of them are fantastic (though I did love the old ones ofc)

- The achievements and their names are really great, I love a game with good steam achievements- gives me motivation to reach certain goals

- Carthago Delenda Est

- I don't know if it's just me, or maybe the difficulty settings I'm choosing but the AI doesn't seem *quite* as incompetent as I remember? They're not particularly clever by any means but can be a challenge, certainly if they vastly outnumber you on Hard or Very Hard battle difficulty. Perhaps it's just because I'm still in early game but I feel like as delightfully stupid as they still are, they can overwhelm you if you don't have the right units or don't do well enough with your tactics.

- Some of the new settings are quite nice, the option to switch between ""realistic"" or ""vibrant"" (original) colours, ""realistic governance"" where your settlements will be auto-managed without a governor, the ability (at the start of the campaign at least) to not track other faction's character between turns.

Minor quibbles:

- Adding Campaign Multiplayer would be nice.

- Some pathfinding issues remain (though this is definitely improved)

- The UI (somewhat minor but the biggest issue)

Lots of people are saying it but the UI is not as good, particularly for constructing buildings, recruiting units and settlement management but also for agent actions such as assassinations. It's too small, more spread out and seems to attempt to make it look more like the newer total wars while (thankfully) retaining the original functionality. I've never been a fan of the way the newer titles handled construction. The little red numbers remind me of phone push notifications which isn't that nice and you have to go through extra clicks to access things like the construction report which I always use to make sure I'm building things everywhere when I can. Even things like squalor and corruption are just depicted as percentages now and I liked having the little visual symbols with them. The notifications are similarly hidden in battles, I once had a general die in combat and didn't realise until a few moments later because I had multiple generals and he wasn't the leading commander of the army.

In some ways the UI is aesthetically pleasing, and the old one was rather clunky in some respects, showing its age. With the new family tree (though I miss the old portraits for woman and children) I really like the smokey effect with the faction colours behind it for example. I also really like the full map view in campaign and tactical view in battles. The UI looks really sleek generally and a lot neater, to it's credit, it's just the sizing and the way that it is arranged that I take issue with. Still having the option to view settlements on the zoomed in map with citizens walking around is really nice.

Overall I'm very happy to have had an opportunity to be back playing this game with a nicely updated engine. I can live with the UI- it's not a dealbreaker, I'm hoping it can be improved and I really like that it stayed true to the original without too much tampering. The graphical overhaul and bug fixes were some of the biggest issues that needed addressing- no more pointy legs haha. The merchants are a nice little addition as well. I didn't want a new game with a remaster so I'm actually happy that it's stayed so (relatively) true to the original, we have Rome 2 already, didn't need too much new content- this just breathed some life into an old classic and I'm thankful for that.",1620049119,1620049622,True,14,2,0.59423220157623291,0,True,False,False

Positives
1)New graphics are beautiful
2)Game runs really smooth i have everything maxed out except from the new test size and i enjoyed a battle of 30 k men with an average of 40 fps which i think is good at this specific scenario.
3)Non roman Ai in campaign acts different and i agree that it acts better and i expect that an optional land bridge(Minor asia,sicely,Spain) would help alot as well.
4)The option of using old or new features,the ability to change campaign difficulty in game and many other remastered options are really nice.

Negatives

1)Ui is awful and i will try to explain this to you.The old one wasn't perfect at all but that's not an excuse for this UI at 
(5/3/2021)

1.2) Ui notifications are awful, its hard to know when a city will be upgrade as you need to click to a special tab and read everything, it was way better at the OG in my opinion
1.3)Agents going to succeed at their actions is very hard to spot as you need to check right at the bottom of the screen instead in the middle.
1.3)Its hard to know when a general got a trait for example since there's not a sound effect as it used to be in the OG
1.4)Why i am forced to click something on the edge on the screen and then i am forced to check the opposite side of the edge for informations?Thats awful and i am surprised that this made it to the game without someone complaint about it.
1.5) Family managment can be tricky as soon as you get many family members but if you want to fix it its up to you.



Also let me tell you this.Why you should expect a Multiplayer campaign if ""iTs A rEmAsTeR"" but we aren't allowed to wait for a fixed pathfinding since they need to rewrite it and its a remaster and not a remake. Well then go on and charge 30 dollars for this game and as soon someone notice the path finding he will just refund thats all.Back in the day the game was very good but now it faces competition from Attila,rome 2 and others.If you want to charge for this price and aim for new players it will be a failure.As i bought it for 15 i don't complaint since i got 3 games i could even pay to 100 dollars for nostalgia but no newer player will do this.It would have been a better choice to fix the path finding and charge for this price than say its a remaster and go pay for 30 dollars thats just an excuse.

So you can fix the UI and maybe adjust the price for newer players.The rest of things that are mostly bugs will probably get fixed so i amn't going to write them and  i will give time to feral to fix them since they are common on the launch anyways.
If they don't remaster medieval 2 don't blames others since i already supported the game by pre-order and not refund but this willn't make me to not point what i think that's not done right",1620045909,1620048508,False,9,0,0.551046907901763916,0,True,False,False

I feel like I am playing a new game, but still Rome Total War, if that makes any sense? It's like being able to re-explore the old game again.
A small thing I noticed, the unit with the captain in now is able to rally troops and perform their unique ability (i.e phalanx). Really small, but a nice little feature!
I haven't had any problems with pathfinding, it's basically the same as the original Rome Total War. But then I'm not the kind of player to be constantly giving commands to my troops (like in reality). I understand a lot of people play the game like LOL or DOTA, which in my opinion is just not realistic. Cavalry is ok for maneuvering also.  -> UPDATE - Pathfinding sucks, I lost my chariot general because he ran the wrong way into a bunch of spears! I wanted him to leave the settlement and instead ran opposite to the gate... Never had this problem with the original.

However the campaign UI takes some getting used to. The useful information, such as new buildings, armies, your general's stats, are tiny whereas the useless information seems to flood the screen. It would be nice if the UI could be adjusted or reverted to the original. After setting the UI scale to 120% it certainly improves, but it's still far from ideal.

I do recommend this game, this is easily the best Total war out there. The changes they made from the original game are disappointing but at least it wont crash every 5 minutes.

The Bad:

-WHAT IS THIS UI?? at least give us a CHOICE!!!!!

-Most changes they made are very questionable...

-What is this new AI? ""More aggressive"" its just erratic and acts against its own interest a lot.

-Ai is still kinda bad at developing 

-The movement and positioning sometimes is off, it way to often just ignores the formation you wanted and just registers a click, also i wish they upgraded the pathing a little, Units still take too long to actually get into formation after moving.

The Good:

-While its still an easy game it is a little more challenging than most Total wars

-Old Rome Total war was my favorite game and this is not only about nostalgia, i played more Rome 1 Total war than any other total war and thats with it crashing.

-City Management actually matters, developing your economy feels good

-Loosing troops actually matters, every soldier you recruit will be deducted to the Town.

-The animations in the new Total war games look amazing but not having those animations actually makes the Battle more fluent.

-Most countries actually play out very differently.

-NOSTALGIA

-glad they upgraded the Graphics a little.

-I kinda like new Merchants

-You can choose what changes you want to use (mostly)

I stay positive and hope they address some of the issues since this is a 35$ pricetag and deserves some love, I will keep it at recommended for now and might change it later if they don't patch the issues, it's still my favorite Total war on Steam.",1620034597,1620034597,True,1,0,0.51742631196975708,0,True,False,False

I then got a bit more back into it in the last few years thanks to YouTubers such as Many A True Nerd and Melkor. I then learned it was getting a remaster, and it was releasing on my birthday. It seemed like fate, and my expectations were high.

So far, it has been everything I both expected and wanted. I've not gotten to play it that much yet, but I will update this if anything changes. So let's go through the changes and what I think about them.

Bad:
[list]
[*]Frankly, I think the new tutorial is pretty bad, at least compared to the original. It does its job, it teaches the game, but the original Sons of Mars tutorial was much more fun and interesting.
[*]Loading times are pretty bad. It was bearable at first but it's getting to the point when sometimes loading screens can last longer than some battles (those battles where you're just clearing up 1-2 units of rebels). This may be partially due to installing the game on my HDD rather than SSD due to space issues, or rather lacking memory for a modern machine though.
[/list]

Neutral:
[list]
[*]New UI is okay in my opinion. It will take some time to get used to, but I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as other people say it is.
[*]New camera is also okay, again I will need to get used to it, so no particularly strong opinions so far.
[*]New battle and campaign AI seems slightly better, but still not very good. That's fine though, the original RTW had the same issues so I can live with it. I can see it potentially being frustrating for new players though.
[*]Pathfinding is likewise, possibly slightly better, but still not great. Again, perhaps not as big a problem for people like me who are used to it, but could be a problem for new players. (Added in Edit) The pathfinding absolutely struggles in cities. I've had half of a unit get stuck between buildings and the rest go as I wanted. There's also a strange case where units don't like to form up as you want in tight streets. I do play on huge unit scale, which might not help.
[*]Balance changes aren't very noticeable. Javelin/peltast infantry do a little less damage but slightly more range and chariots are slightly weaker, that's about it.

[*]New graphics look great, haven't had any performance issues so far and the game just looks much better.
[*]All nations are available from the start, you don't need to complete a campaign to unlock half of them and the remaining still be locked unless you manually edit text files. This doesn't include the SPQR or rebels, but that's not a problem for me.
[*]New diplomacy information is great. It feels like it took the good parts from the Medieval 2 diplomacy and added them in, as well as a few new things that I also quite like.
[*]All new features except graphics and UI can be turned off. This means you can just play RTW exactly how it was with updated graphics and UI. This alone would have been good enough for me.
[*]It's Rome Total War, one of my favourite games ever, with a bit of an upgrade.

The problem is the UI. It's terrible. 

Let me list my own issues (not an exhaustive list):
1. it scales terribly for 4k. It's huge, and spread out more than it needs to be.
2. they didn't retain the same campaign controls as the orignal. why? sure change the battle map to WASD like TWW2, that's great, but why change the campaign controls?
2.a right clicking on a building doesn't open the building browser.
2.b the building browser doesn't show pictures of the actual building like the original
2.c pressing R to animate units faster has to be done EACH TIME you move a unit. It doesn't remember your choice like in TWW2 or the ORIGINAL.
2.d clicking on a settlement doesn't show the building list. there's a needless extra click.
2.e clicking the magnifying glass on the new turn construction summary, doesn't take you to the building screen for the settlement. necessitating even more clicks. 
2.e.2 it doesn't help that the button to build is centre screen, the options are way on the right, and the existing buildings are centre screen. Find your way to the browser to check what temple does what, oh wait where the hell are the temples?
2.f same needless clicking for building applies to recruitment as well. same process.

Do they expect everyone to still be running at 1024x768 like the original? Why aren't buildings and recruitable troops shown AUTOMATICALLY when you left click a settlement, so you can quickly one-click build/recruit/queue whatever you like.

The UI makes no effort to benefit from today's minimum of 1920x1080 and that's sad.

Additionaly, by default your settlement names don't show on the campaign like the original. and you have to mouseover to have any idea what your public order is. there is a list you can use to see what they are at a glance, but why change the original's methodology? Just add the list (which is yet another hard to find click, of course).

You can't get any strategic awareness from the campaign map with respect to settlements. it's bizarre.

I can only imagine that the team that made this never played the original. or if they did, it was as 'homework' for this job and not as actual players when it was released. The lack of understanding is clearly visible.

The worst part is that the game is largely unchanged and still a good game. It' astounds me that they've made it MORE CONVOLUTED TO PLAY. wtf. don't up the difficulty by making the UI obtuse and negating all my muscle memory from thousands of total war hours.

I don't know what to say beyond this. wowzers.

First, some people may have not realised that the enhanced graphics are separate download. This should be communicated more clearly in the game menu. 
The UI is wierd at first, but it is not as bad as many folks present it to be. But it should be on 120% scale by default. I also recommend decreasing the vibrancy of the campaign map.
30 euro/dollars is just too high a price for this product. This price stops newer players from trying out the game. 
At that price, there really should be an option for much better battle and campaign AI, pathfinding, etc. - again, mostly for the sake of the new players, who have not played older games and don't have the option to buy this for just 15 euro/dollars.

In short: It's a great adaptation to modern resolutions and machines. The fact that I have no issues playing this in Windowless Border, and constantly alt+tab'ing to other windows while it runs is just what the doctor ordered. The new assets and the fact that all changes can be toggled to go back to the previous version, means there's nothing her to not enjoy.

I don't mean to call anyone out or anything, but when I was going through the negative reviews before buying this, it seems the vast majority of them were people who didn't know how to toggle the options they weren't appreciating off/on. For example. The old camera is still in the game and can be turned on. The old unit designs, the Auto-run toggle. Etc. The only thing that can't be toggled is the new UI, which while vastly different from how it used to be, is functional and actually ergonomic once you get used to it after a couple turns.

There are some problems of course. However, I can only find minor, non-game breaking ones (Though those who are experiencing problems with their Windows Version are justly annoyed of course.) Things like the sound it used to make when zooming on a battle no longer being there, or sometimes the audio mixing seems to be a bit quiet, as well as soundtracks and the like not continuing into the load-screen and firmly cutting off. That and an occasionally, and unexplained long load time to get into the campaign, though that only happens on launching it, not coming back from a battle.

In conclusion, it's a great remaster. Sets out to simply polish and make it easier to play for now-a-days, and with the new nice graphics, the new additions and tweaks, I'd certainly say they succeeded. Now if only they took it a step further and let us do some multiplayer campaigns.

Much better graphic than the original.
Works much better with newer hardware and windows editions.

Cons
Very overpriced if you buy it for full price. Wait until there is a sale.

I have seen too many ""remastered"" games belly flop on the pavement because of poorly implemented changes and crucial misteps. So the big question is: Did Total War: Rome belly flop, or can it stand proud between other remastered games?

Honestly, the answer to that question aint as easy as I thought it would be. I have seen the other reviews, and everyone has there own opinion. But let me prefice this by saying that, while I accept the simple fact that people have their own ipinions, I honestly cannot see the problem people are having with the UI. Yes, its a change from the old UI, and it does take some time to get used to it. But I dont wanna say the UI is bad perse, rather that its different from the original. 

Another positive is the fact that, through the game launcher, ya can ""unlock"" all the other factions from the get go, without the need to do a playthrough first. But it is a option! If yer like me, and ya want to EARN the right to play with the Gauls (for example)  ya can still unlock the Gauls through the normal way of wiping the faction off the campaign map during a playthrough.  But there is a option to unlock them from the get go, and I think that is a absolute plus!!

Now, for the negatives, cause I wanna be honest with you all. Firstly...we all know that the Total War series has a ingame Launcher. Well, if I select the Total War Rome within that ingame launcher...it takes me to ANOTHER  launcher to select WHICH Total War Rome I wanna play ( Vanilla, Barbarian Invasion or Alexander)...and it gives me the chance to tweek setting before I start the game. Now, while I do get the fact that they made a launcher...the fact that its a launcher WITHIN another launcher is just weird and illogical. Ya cannot tell me there could wasnt another way, so we dont have to click through multiple launchers just so we can start the game. 

Secondly, I think the updated graphics, while everything looks pretty darn good, could be touched up a bit more. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are updated! But i feel that they could have done a bit more. There is still a big difference between the graphical qualitly om Total war: Rome Remastered and Total War: Warhammer. 

Lastly, and I know that I am nitpicking here, the pre-battle speeches. It's one of my favorite things within the original TW: Rome, and to a point, even gets me hyped up for battle. So whats wrong with it?? Well, in the old version, the soldiers started screaming and bashing their shield RIGHT AFTER the speech ended, giving you the feeling the your troops are ready for war. In the remaster however, there are about two seconds of silence before the soldiers react. And honestly, that just feels weird, like the troops woke up from their nap and where like: ""Oh damn, the general just finished his speech, QUICK, BASH SHIELDS AND SCREAM!!"" Like I said, I know that I am nitpicking because I know the original Rome like the back of my hand, and I honestly think this should not be seen as a negative point. But I did want to call it out.

All in all, if you love the original, you will love the Remastered version. Yes, the UI is different, and it will take some time to get used to it, but it is still a joy to play. It's worth the price of €15,- (I have the original on Steam, so i got 50% off), but I am kind of doubting if I would have paid full price for it. If ya dont have the original on Steam for the 50% off, grab it on a sale.

Apparently it doesn't work on anything except Windows 10, too (all Windows 7 users can suck it).

And then when you get into the game, the UI is a maze. I've never seen a game with a more convoluted and inefficient UI. There's no way I'm going to waste my time learning this poorly designed mess. 

Also there's a massive delay while drag box selecting and dragging placement lines.

I owned the original version of Rome via Steam, so I only had to pay half price to get the remaster. For some reason, Steam, CA, or whoever, decided that the Remaster removes the original version of the game from your account and computer. So I do count that as a big negative.
The new UI is not an improvement at all. It's not a bad UI, you can find pretty much everything you need, but it lacks the clarity and clean look of the original. Why they replaced it, I have no idea. If you were going to change anything in the game, I would have changed the ""you can only recruit one unit per city per turn,"" which is not a limitation any TW game has had since at least ME2. 
That being said, the updated graphics are updated. They still have the same feel as the old ones, which is nice. They also set it up so all the factions can be played in the base game, which is a big improvement from how it was with the original. The Merchant (imported from ME2) is...as useless as he is in that game, but he doesn't hurt anything, except when you're bound by the single recruit thing, which also used for agents as well as soldiers. 
Is it worth $30? Well, going by ME2, the game would be $10, possibly including the Xpacs, which would make this a $20 upgrade. Given that it takes twice the RAM of Shogun 2 and 13 GB more disk space, while equaling its graphics at best, no, not really.
If you like Rome 1 and want to check it out, buy it on sale. The changes haven't fucked it up (UI not withstanding), but I wish they'd only updated the graphics only. As it stands, I'm giving it a positive rating, but yeah, 7/10 seems fair for the $30 price tag. If you can get it for $10-15, I'd rate it a 9/10.",1620010160,1620010160,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the plus side the UI is looking nice and the units are looking much better also. 

The Map, especially Italy is looking not as good as I think it could have. Its almost too green.

Also when you remaster a game that also should mean you remaster other parts, like the still brain dead AI in diplomacy.
have an alliance and trade rights? surprise war next turn. 
The new graphics at max settings still don't even look that good. Rome 2 is still prettier and easier to play then this.
Comparing the original Rome to this is like comparing Civilization 5 to 6, over the top color pallet on campaign map which makes it look cartoony.
At least you get the DLC's but with the puzzling UI i can't look at it for more then 2 minutes and go, ""wheres that button at?"" or ""why do i have to look at his? this isn't important.""

Other than the somewhat unfriendly UI, this REMASTER is well made. its the old rome total war, pretty much everything is the same, other than the quality of life improvements which were very much needed. (camera controls, army movement controls and much better performance etc) and obviously the improved graphics.  and most, if not all, new gameplay additions and tweaks  to original can be switched off. 

i would certainly recommend this REMASTER, Rome total war was my first total war game that got me into the series, and this REMASTER i believe does it justice, 

its sad to see so many reviews negative because it doesnt work on windows 7. its something buyer should be aware of and not buy if they have older version of windows.

It's basically Rome Total War but with modern Total War controls, so groups actually make sense, camera controls are easy to use, you can drag formations around and have more control over your formations and the like. 

Campaign and battles of old school total war (individual units acting independently within larger units, rather than the modern method of units just having a total health pool and models dying to reflect it), but with the controls of a modern total war game. I see that as an absolute win.

 Get that through your thick skulls guys. If anyone, ANYONE, was looking for a massive overhaul of the original total war rome, your frankly a ""special"" person. Ive Never played the original game, i was actually about to buy it to try it out when the REMASTER was announced. And i couldnt be more excited. Please ignore the fanbase as the total war community is one of the most toxic fanbases out there. 
  If your looking to play the game that started it all with really low expectations as this is a REMASTER of the 2004 game no more or less. then i would say pick this up! For fans who have played total war since the original shogun days this will send you back! The UI is outdated, and the campaign map is definitely outdated with how slow it goes. But i bought this knowing it was a REMASTER and not a remake. 
 Literally all they did was update the graphics, slap a new UI on there, and make the Original game work on PCs again as newer PCs couldnt play this. And added the Merchent Agent which i guess wasnt there before. 
 In my opinion its amazing and better than Rome 2. Really dont understand why Rome 2 is praised cause of mods. In my opinion a game fails if mods are needed to make the game better.

* Sometimes when adopting people into your family they inexplicably die soon after. I thought this might have been because of something that happened in the game but it had continued going on.

* For some reason, only the troops that carried the ladder and siege tower will actually use the siege equipment which is kind of absurd, there's no reason a different group of peasants can't also use the ladders to breach the walls and I believe this wasn't an issue in the classic game.

* I could be mistaken here but I believe units like Ballista were able to enter and exit settlements and for some reason mine would refuse to enter or exit their own settlements while on the battle field.

* Game crashes every so often though it is not horrendous or terribly intrusive it is mildly annoying every so often.

For the things I like:

Rome remastered is quite literally Rome Total War and all of it's DLCs with good graphics, new art, rebalancing, and a modern control scheme. Beyond this, multiple factions that were previously unplayable are now accessible to the player, adding a new layer of gameplay. 
To put it simply: This will satisfy your nostalgia for Rome 1 without you having to play with 2004 controls and graphics. It also allows you to explore beyond that nostalgia. It really feels great playing.

For the things I don't like:

Minor:
It has some flaws regarding bugs and patfinding, and in gameplay has a lack of complexity compared to other modern games, (the original was after all made in 2004)

Major:

UI and icon changes - I feel like alot about these aspects of the game was unnecessarily changed, i.e. all the smoothed edges, new boxes, moved buttons, etc. 

The notifications went from being simple icons dropping on the side of your screen which could easily be expanded into a large easy to see box to these tiny things in the top right of your screen that expand into another tiny box, the unit cards are curved and are not in a box, the settlement and faction information is all confusing to find and understand, etc.. When in the original Rome I could right click on a building or unit and have a large easy to read box pop up with a clearly visible image and it's history and traits and everything, now it's this tiny little box in the corner, the historical information is in a different tab, the image is hard to see, etc. 
Essentially it all boils down to them making unnecessary ui and icon changes and relocations.

Price: $30 is too much. For me, $15 was worth it, but no one should have to spend $30 on a remaster of a formerly $8 game, especially when the gameplay is literally the same thing as the original.",1619996917,1619998738,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This has to be the worst version of the game. I was not going to buy it after reading other reviews and watching some YouTube videos, but went ahead because of the modding possibilities.

The main problem I have with this game is the AI and it's pathfinding especially in settlements. It is absolutely atrocious. I also had 4 units that can throw missiles at one unit and after 3 volleys, not one casualty!
A mounted unit got stuck in a 'celebration' action and no further action could be done with it!

The 'free city' faction again has too many ships that appear from nowhere as well as little armies appearing in the middle of your 'Empire'..

The 'eye candy' has no relevance for me, but functionality does, and this game is next to useless in battle mode.

Original owners know what I'm talking about, but for newcomers I have to say that this game is perfectly balanced in management for me. Total War Rome II is very complex, while this game offers some nice options in units, buildings, upgrades, agents, diplomacy and trade, without having to scrutinize every little detail in every little turn. In other words, it has a nice play and feel to it and offers more than enough managable options to make every single campaign interesting. It also runs very smoothly on my pc.
Also don't forget that you get all DLC's are included! Three seperated but chronologically linked scenario's on the same campaign map.

To the old and loyal, I am glade to see you are back.
To our young and new,  I bit you a warm welcome.

It saddens me that I have to say after all these years, the Glory that was ones Rome has Faded.
I look at the Glory that we had (i had reinstalled Rome TW) and at what Rome has become. (remastered)
Where it we ones were able to see our goals clearly, we now have been clouded by hidden and shrouded tabs.
( Rome 1 had a great clean and simple display; unfortunately they now are hidden with more cartoon like buttons. making it for me very frustrating. this because i also played Rome 2 and now Warhammer (1,2 and soon 3) TW)
Where you my sons and daughters of Rome have spent moon cycles and many winters defending our homes at the frontline. We now come home to our beloved Rome to see what they have done.
They and our beloved Rome had 16 winters long to learn and grow. And so it saddens me to see that not much has changed. And that what had changed my friends is a disgrace to our beloved Rome.

The graphics in the game have been slightly bettered. 
The campaign map looks a bit cartoon like for me. and i checked the old one and it almost looks better.
The combat system got more difficult because you have to do extra steps and its less clearly as it was before.

In my opinion the only thing they had to do was up the graphics. from what it had to HD/4K.
They could have added some new units or options.
And the only good thing i could find was that you are allowed to trade followers between Generals ect.
This allows you to get a good follower from a General that you use as a governor to sent it to a General at the frontline.
This may sound harsh but it is sadly true. this could have been the game you would buy for friends and family.
!! The one and only thing i have to give them credit for is that they did not touch the way a city grows.
I am saying this because they changed it in the new games. In the old games you needed population in real numbers like 400 for a small village and 6000 for a city. 
So you had to be careful with how many Legionaries you would train, because it would redoes the amount you had in a city; what subsequently would made you wait longer to upgrade a city. !!

So for those who thing my opinion is or could be unfounded, I say this.
I have spent the last 16 winters (16 years) at the frontline commanding army's.
Where my friends would go for strange elf or weard flying things (warcraft starcraft) I stayed true to Rome.
So long that I ended in the dark ages. (medievil TW, I did not like the rest that much that came after. time wise)
After coming back (rome2) I was sent to new and strange lands. (warhammer TW) 

In the end my fellow men, I can not look with any favor of the gods on (recommend) buying this game. (rome 1 is still recommended)

I will keep the game incase they change somethings to make the game worthy again.",1619990992,1619990992,False,5,0,0.515503287315368652,0,True,False,False

That alone was enough for me to make the upgrade worthwhile, so i can keep playing the classic.  Since i play on a laptop (from 2016) with a not so heavy graphics card, i am happy that they kept the system specs low enough for me to run the remastered version smoothly. 

I can't complain about the new factions and the new units (merchant etc) i love them. 

There were a few things however that i wished they would have remastered as well:

- make the battle unit action buttons & card more streamlined, similar to the newer Total War games
- better AI battle strategy, the CPU player is behaving the same as the non-remastered version

This game remasters faithfully the original game and adds a few improvements: mainly improved battle controls, better graphics and better support for modern operating systems. Also, modding, but more on that later on.

It does however have a few cons. I am disappointed that Feral did not include a multiplayer campaign feature  and the ui takes a lot of space on the screen. I preferred the minimal ui of the orignial. That's not to say that the OG was better as there is no comparison and the remastered is better on almost every way. And anyway, you get the OG when buyong the game if you don't already own it on Steam.

And then, there is modding. This game offers so much modding potential that value for the price is huge. Right from the release of the game, there are already great mods : a hotseat mod, a mod that adds naval battles, a mod that adds regions, etc. And for those that are interested in modding, modding the game is easy.

I love the new tribal touch for the Thracians campaign music expanding upon similar tones in the game keeping the same color of sound but finding the edge that represents their mixing of the balkan tribes and greeks. I am sure I will find other tidbits, like the random flatulence in ranks although I would guess the follow up of an excuse me is hardly what any of these rough men would think to say from this time in history...it just did not seem to fit.

The Good: 
They have greatly improved the AI.
AI will now field much better armies, and provide a challenge to players in the mid-game.
AI cities will actually grow (in the original nothing would grow much past minor city)
All factions are unlocked
Path finding is hugely improved over original (though not perfect)

The Bad: 
UI is a little difficult to understand. It's harder to see how a building in your queue will impact your income.

Changes to AI behaviour have made some factions in the base game are much weaker than they were in the original. Rome often doesn't expand outside of Italy until much later in game. Rome was quite OP in the original, so it's not an entirely unwelcome change, but it is a big change since the original. 

A much more serious problem, in BTW the Barbarian factions are not nearly as aggressive as they were in the original games. At the moment it's not unusual for the WRE and ERE to survive without much intervention by the player. In my ERE campaign, neither the Huns, Vandals, or Goths crossed the Danube, and the WRE didn't lose a settlement in France or Italy... I think maybe the AI is focused on taking the easiest available settlements (usually barbarian rebel cities), and not focused enough on campaign objectives (taking Roman territory).

There are only 3 key issues. First is the UI. I totally agree that the UI is ass, but once you get used to it, it's not a big deal. Plus with the workshop up and running, we're bound to see a mod that gives us the old UI soon enough. The Second is path finding. Now lets be honest, path finding in the original RTW was also pretty trash, but something about updated maps has messed with it further. It is not game breaking, and it will not likely change the fate of your battles, but it is annoying, and will probably lead to extra deaths in sieges. The final major issue crashes. in 8 hours of gameplay, I've had it crash 3 times, while this is annoying, total wars constant autosaves don't make it too much of an issue. Hopefully those bugs will get patched soon. Just about everything else in the game is good. The option to switch between goofy and serious art style is nice, and the whole game really pays homage to the original RTW. In my opinion, if you would still recommend RTW, then there is no reason to not recommend the remaster. I feel like a lot of reviews of this game are clouded by nostalgia, and are overly harsh even though they 'haven't put more than a few hours in the game. I think the biggest plus of this game is the fact that we now have a steam workshop, and the modding community is going to flourish because of it. And even if you don't believe anything I say, purchasing this game, and leaving good review, might lead CA and Sega to put more resources towards developing more historical total wars in the future, and god only knows how much we all want that.",1619973957,1619973957,True,1,1,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,False

[h1] Pros over the OG [/h1]
+Many much welcomed QoL improvements (modern cameral controls and shortcuts).
+Fares better on modern hardware than the OG (my computer easily runs 8k soldiers battles on the remastered title but was laggy at around 4k on the original title).
+The game looks gorgeous with the new lightning and HD textures (upgrade available as a free DLC).
+Many people argue that the remaster is not worth the 30 bucks but they forget there are 6 games included in it (Total war rome, Alexander and Barbarian invasion, remastered and originals).

[h1]Pros over modern total war titles.[/h1]
+Population system! Recruiting troops depletes your population and economy so winning a decisive battle will cripple your enemies and battles feel more impacting.
+Battle AI, the AI will retreat and flee the field of battle if it's losing in an attempt to save what's left of its army.
+Battles, cavalry is much quicker and responsive, battles can be very fast if you exploit the weaknesses in the enemy's line or long if it's a hard battle.
+Logistic, bring your armies from your homeland to the front yourself, manage your population, recrutement centers, supply loops and ambush enemy troops while they try to do the same.
+Trade is semi automatic, you can still make trade agreements but settlements automatically trade with each other so you are no longer stuck with a dumb AI refusing to sign a trade agreement even though it will benefit from it.
+Units aren't stuck with their army, detach your army's cavalry on the campaign map to chase down some smaller annoying armies, keep attacking in the enemy's territory and bring back reinforcements from your elite barracks without sending back the whole army to recruit new elite units.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
-The UI is strange at first compared to the OG but it's not that problematic an hour into the game, you get used to it.
-May not interest new total war players used to Warhammer's level of strategy (I mean no strategy and playing an RPG instead).

[h1]Remaster controversy[/h1]
According to some nostalgic players, the remaster is worse than the OG.
I've never heard something that wrong, the game has much more modding potential than the OG, improved performances, graphics and AI.

My opinion
------------
I played this game a multiple times ever since its release. I am an expert by saying I played this game on very hard multiple times on multiple devices on multiple screens multiple times! 

I am telling you now, I was surprised when I saw 40gb download at first but then I assumed that was the videos that had that responsibility. 
However that turned out to be all wrong. 

Around turn 15, anywhere where there are multiple units like say all of Italy and Greece, if I hover my screen over the map in those areas where my territories are, my computer slows down to like almost 90% that its hardly able to process anything, massive lag... 

Such a simple game became over complicated. 

How typical from total war and actvision to ruin another release... Im not sure what they are doing but they are hurting their customers as much as they are hurting themselves.

I will no longer buy any game from total war unless they are bug free. They dont seem to learn their lesson. 
I regret buying it in this condition. I would rather go back to the old version. 2.1 gb game i believe it was.

----------
I take it all back, well done with the quick fixes!

I surround them at there town centre then attack all at once expecting a fight to the death. well instead  after about 10 seconds of engagement my whole army routs leading to a Massacred. it doesn't make sense. by all means try and you will see... it brakes the game. also path finding can be a bit annoying. 
My advice is mod the game so that moral is impacted by troop numbers also, so you are less likely to retreat if you have massive number advantage 3 - 1 advantage for example. 

in short its not realistic for whole armies to run after about 1 minute of battle without a reason. Increase army moral would also help.

The UI is... Not great, unfortunately. Not awful, but definitely more designed for aesthetics than functionality. It definitely takes some getting useful.

Graphics are solid, and keep very close to the original game's style. The option to switch between the bright colours of the classic game's units and a slightly more realistic darker hue is a welcome feature, as well.

Gameplay changes are almost universally improvements over the original, and the ability to toggle individual elements between the classic and modern functionality allows you to pick and choose which changes you want to keep.

Mod support is even better than the original, though we'll have to wait and see whether anything is made to match the heights of Europa Barbarorum or Roma Surrecta.

All in all, a solid remaster that you should definitely play if you enjoy classic Total War.

I've always preferred the modern camera controls to the old Rome 1/Medieval 2 one, it makes battles much more fluid which is really important in these fast paced battles. UI for firing arcs, hiding foliage and unit movement is so helpful, and you can toggle these UI features to your choosing, which is really handy, especially with that big ugly circle they've decided to try out. Alerts for idle campaign characters is handy, same with the whole notification panel being placed in a nice and compact part of the screen, sorted into their individual boxes such as senate missions, civil and military are all nice as well. Graphics are decent, barring some oddities like white grass in place of snow. 

Now for the bad:

Sometimes the delay when issuing orders is way too high, in the original it was maybe half a second but Rome Remastered has 2 seconds which is not good for a game that's incredibly fast paced and it has cost me some battles as a result. The campaign menus are needlessly all over the place, they should have just kept the original, and I feel the campaign AI is somehow worse as well, there were certain battles it could have fought and won but it instead just sat there waiting for reinforcements. 

The battle UI is the absolute worst. Time is of the essence in Rome and having to fiddle around with the new clunky layout is a frustrating affair, all the necessary buttons are spread willy nilly down the bottom of the screen, why? They should have just kept the original Battle Hud where all the abilities you needed were centred around a button that flashed your own units when you clicked it. So I tried to fix this by going into the menus and rebinding some controls, but apparently certain keys I'm not allowed to change like guard mode and fire at will without switching to the classic layout, but I can't change some of the camera controls. Between this and the utterly random delays when issuing orders, it makes the game borderline unplayable for me.

On a side note, why did they decide to change some of the faction intros? Carthage? Scipii? It's unnecessary!

Overall:

Unless you're a die hard Rome 1 fan who just wants a taste of the original game with a fresh coat of paint, don't get it until these issues have been resolved. I rate a 5/10. This does not bode well for historical titles in the future, and I absolutely hope Feral does not touch Medieval 2.",1619830889,1619959295,False,4,0,0.535493850708007813,0,True,False,False
885970,91289313,76561197970827926,0,4,5923,16,394,1707867451,"Faithful remastering of one of my favourite games of all time. A few optional tweaks and changes (I leave them all on, but you can have it classic if you only want the new graphics and UI and nothing else). The toggle system to turn new things on or off is good and shows it is very much made for all the die hard fans of Rome and the old style of total war games (like me!). I hope they will make some new games in this style as well rather than just the remaster.

Graphics are more modern (but not actually up to date standard). I understand this is partly due to the limits of the old engine. It looks far more pixelated than I was expecting though, even with antialiasing on max the spears and any other thin lines look very bad. High resolution support is great. Vibrancy looks like a 5 year old with crayons was let loose, but fortunately you can turn this down/off. The unit models look great up close and are now varied rather than clones. Love the feature where they now reflect the ethnicity of the region they were recruited (and also dynamically where casualties are re-trained) as it makes it look much more organic and varied.

Changes to the camera controls takes a little getting used to. WASD is the default instead of arrows, and you now can 'freelook' with middle mouse button. Overall I feel like I have much more control over the camera and it already feels natural and instinctive to use the new controls. Camera controls is one of the parts that really have got much better in more recent total war games, so its good to be able to take this part from them and put it back into Rome.

Units respond to orders slightly differently and this still causes me to accidentally give incorrect orders. Units don't maintain formations when sending multiple with a right click (they just form a line instead), you have to alt-drag to do that instead. Path finding is meant to have been improved, but I feel the issue with units going onto/off the plazza via a weird diagonal angle is worse than before not better. Maybe it's my imagination, but it seems like there is also a longer delay between clicking and the troops moving than there was before (maybe thinking time for the new pathfinding). I've not noticed any improvements with the pathfinding yet, but there are at least visible paths on screen, so you know straight away if they are going the wrong way. Being able to drag unit cards to reorder them makes me happy though. I find the ranged fire arcs very useful and it's nice that you can now turn run by default on when you are in combat (and toggle it back off during manoeuvres).

AI is greatly improved in sieges (at least when they are attacking). They no longer charge headlong into your prepared phalanx in many of the situations they used to, instead circling around and using other routes when available. For example, first time I was defending when their spy opened the gates I had a bit of a surprise, they moved round to other gates (staying out of range of the arrow towers) and went in those. They still only use each ram once though, and if you cover all available entrances they go back to their old tactic of suicide charges, with only a small amount of ranged support instead of exhausting ammunition first like a human would. Still, if they were too good I wouldn't be able to cheese them with a few militia hoplites and then how would I be able to win anymore! Other changes in sieges include them charging ranged units down back alleys to fire at you with no melee support, where it is very easy to surround them if you have a cavalry unit, but still a big improvement from what they used to do (charge them into melee combat on the plazza). On the open battle field they do behave a little differently for those that know and can predict exactly how they used to respond, but I don't think its actually made them any better, just different. Still fairly simple to do the old 'hammer and anvil' or hit and run with horse archers.

The strategy map UI is all different and takes some real getting used to. Because the tax rate is on a different screen I keep forgetting to set it at the moment, but I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually (pop is happy that I keep leaving it at normal instead of high)! Once you start to adapt to the changes it definitely has some advantages over the original UI. You can have multiple windows open at the same time (leave the construction/recruitment notification open whilst setting the new build orders, and even move the new recruits out without loosing your place in the list). The only thing I miss is the big unit details windows when you right click a unit with a pic, the stats and description. This is now relegated to little card at the side of the screen and its so small you have to click to swap between the stats and the description.

Unit rebalances (ie changes to maintenance and perceived strength for auto calc purposes) and diplomacy changes have changed the flow of the campaign a lot. Seleucids don't die immediately anymore, yay! Egypt's more expensive units mean it no longer has millions of death stacks, yay! I actually bother to engage in diplomacy now beyond just maps and trade rights. Sure they will still break their alliance and stab you in the back when the timing is right, but before they used to do it seemingly with a 50% chance every turn even when it was was a very bad decision for them.

Overall there's really very little I would criticise about this remaster, but don't expect it fix all of Rome's flaws, just some of them.

* The game runs really well and it looks quite good even on old hardware. While I could hardly have 30 fps on the old Rome Total War (even with all the fixes that are available) I can get over 60 fps with almost all settings max out on my old GTX 1060 6GB.
* Feral did a great job preserving the feeling of the classic game, it really feels like you are playing an updated version of the classic game.
* Steam Workshop and modding support will hopefully mean we will get new some great overhaul mods
* It's really cool that they have made some factions playable, and updated them with new units, that weren't in the original game like Pontus, Berber ect. 
* Controlling your units on the battlefield and controlling the camera feels just so much better, now that they made it more in line with modern Total War games. 

[/u] Negatives [/u]

* Despite the claims of ""improved ai"", the AI is almost exactly the same as the old game which makes the game really easy.

* The UI is kinda meh, it's not that bad once you get used to it but I still prefer the old one .

Pre-ordering and downloading it as soon as I could but straight out of the gate it feels wrong. This is a really long list of pros and cons on the campaign and battles, if you're looking for a summary go the bottom. 

The Campaign:
*The UI feels like a mobile game and some menus are soo small, why? There is an entire screen available. There are also some shortcuts on the bottom of the screen that I personally don't use often. 
*I like the fact that they added night battles in the base game but I don't like, as far as I can see, that they serve absolutely no purpose beyond fighting at night. It doesn't stop reinforcing armies or give a morale penalty. There is also a bug where I fight night battles even if I didn't choose to and this even happened when I disabled night battles.
*My reinforcing armies don't show up for battles, I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but I never had this problem in the original. 
*I appreciate the diplomacy changes, the reputation and compensation mechanics are good ideas yet to see if it actually affects the AIs decisions though.
*As far as I've seen the AI still trains mad stacks of a single unit and sprinkles others in every now and then so that's not much better. 
*Of course with the graphical improvements the map looks great and I like that we can change how it looks to our preferences. I like the new unit portraits.
*Merchants have been added I don't mind this, I personally tend not to use them.

The Battles:
*The UI hasn't changed much at all here, except some retarded circle above your units giving you information on their status, personal preference I don't like it, and buttons move according to the unit selected and the state of movement the unit is in but it just takes some getting use to and you're fine.
*They of course brought newer camera controls which is soo much better. 
*I don't know if it actually is or not, it could just be me or maybe you can zoom out more but everything feels smaller like it's all been scaled down.
*The pathfinding is sometimes worse than the original and the units sometimes do this really retarded thing when you move them where they swap positions or something and end up in a cluster fuck. The cavalry are also odd in that they sometimes charge perfectly and other times slowly walk into the enemy or slow down just before they hit for whatever reason.
*The AI does seem better but I'd have to play the original to be sure.
*Small nit pick, the voice you hear when you select or move a unit does not come from the officer in the unit but from the flag or the middle of the unit. It's not important but if I'm not mistaken it was right in the original.

Summary:
The graphics look better but the UI doesn't. 
It runs fine, with a few bugs but I've had no crashes in my 20 hours of playing.
Looking at this game on it's own it's great and you'll most likely enjoy it if you've never played the original, there are of course things to fix which in time I'm sure they will. However comparing it to the original I think it falls a bit short and if you've played the original I'm sure you'll agree.

Maybe wait until it is a bit cheaper (around 20 euro) but it certainly is worth it.

-Morale mechanics are broken (ex: enjoy chained routes of an entire army when one or two of your units buckle)
-Units pathing and AI is still as broken as it was previously, with units sometimes ignoring orders, standing idle, or fucking off to nowhere.
-Cavalry charges are kamakaze fodder as you see multiple horseman dying on any charge, even when the enemies backs are facing you. (lost multiple generals this way)
-Archers in the original, the arrows connected much better and were more deadly, now the arrows have some silly white glow string animation and barely hit anything. (expect anywhere from 3-6 deaths per volley)
-UI as others have said is ridiculous, and I dont understand how its so hard to have organized features. If you look at your units in the battle menu, there isnt even a ROUT button.. lol

Game could have been great revisiting with quality of life improvements. Instead it was just quickly patched over trash, that was just aimed at taking your money, instead of inspiring newcomers to the series to let them revisit what made the franchise so great.

Oh yeah, forgot: there are a lot of qualitiy of life improvements that you can keep turned on or turn off, playing anything inbetween the remastered version and the complete original. Player choice was a top priority it seems. So if you don't want the better - now adequate, it works properly now - skirmishers but the original ones, or any of the other original features, you can.
Also, with 1200-720 resolution and minimum graphics - which still look WAY better than the original - I can still run this with the second-largest unit size (160 men for legionary units) flawlessly. 
And lastly, as I played this in again in the last 15 or so hours, I discover so many little things that show how superbly polished the original was. Just to give you one example among many:
When a unit has an enemy unit behind it, but not in contact, the back rank of soldiers turns around to face that possible threat (which also has in-game effects, e.g. their shields show toward the enemy which actually makes them much harder to kill - because where your shield points actually matters in this game.

I'm not normally a ""good ol' times"" kind of guy, but when I honestly compare this to modern releases that often barely funcion even after day1 patches, the amount of polish - of lovely little details they didn't have to include but did - makes this game such a stand-out. 
If you haven't played this game before but are interested in the era, this is a superbly immersive beer-and-pretzels chill game. And while it is easy as Romans, it can also be very tough as other factions even on medium difficulty.

The UI isn't great, but it isn't bad.  It just needs polished up and it'll be fine.  That said, like a lot of modern games, the UI focuses on using pseudo-windows, which wastes a tremendous amount of space.  I'm fine with it not being the old UI, but you shouldn't be squinting at 1080p like this.

They added arrow trails because you physically cannot see arrows anymore.
The escape key is really clunky now.

There are a lot of pathing issues with cities now, and you can't issue multiple units onto walls or bridges.

As for the good?
Performance is great, and the game only chugged at 3x game speed with nearly 12,000 men on the battlemap, with the new graphics.

I've now beaten it as the Julii and definitely had fun doing so. The only Total War games I really ever play are Rome, Medieval 2, and Shogun 2 and I'm happy to say that I had as much fun playing the remaster as I do the original game.

Let's start off with what the remaster does well:

-First off, the performance. The original game runs terrible on my modern hardware and even drops down to 15 FPS at times when moving around the campaign map a little too fast. In contrast, the remaster runs at a constant 144 FPS (I have a 144 Hz monitor) and moving around the campaign map has never been smoother. Additionally, I play the battles with a higher unit scale than I ever did on the original and still manage to get about 3 to 4 times the frame rate. The people that are saying that this isn't well optimized (at least in comparison to the original release) are simply wrong. I don't see how you could even begin to argue that. I personally wouldn't have minded paying $15 for the performance alone, as the original was a struggle to play sometimes.

-Second, the graphics. Personally, I think the new unit models look great. Most of them keep a similar style to the original game and just touch up on them, making them much higher resolution. In my campaign I was very pleased with how the Roman units looked. As for the campaign map, I can understand why some people have issues with it. Its style is very different from the original's and I don't think it's necessarily a positive change. That being said, I played with campaign map vibrancy on 25% and by the end of the campaign, came to like the new map. The areas around Gaul and Germania look especially good to my eyes due to their darker, more neutral, green color pallet.

-Third, the UI. I know, I know, but hear me out. I think there are some things that the new UI does well. The lists are extremely helpful for example. With the addition of the settlement list, managing your empire in the late game has never been easier. I can press ""1"" and quickly scroll through the list and make sure every settlement is building something, is being governed, is recruiting, etc. While I didn't use the army list a whole lot, I did make use of the agents list and the fleets list quite often. I also like being able to simply click on a city and see everything in it's recruitment queue. In the original, you could only see what was currently being trained and had to open the right hand city panel to see the entire queue. Same for the construction queue, though I usually only build one building at a time in my cities. I also appreciate the fact that examining a unit's stats doesn't take up half of the entire screen.

-Fourth, the AI. Some elements of the AI seem to have been improved. For example, they seem to play better on the campaign map and try to make fuller armies most of the time. They still aren't brilliant (which Total War AI is?) but it's a bit of an improvement I suppose. They also are apparently better at invading by sea, but I didn't see much evidence of this during my campaign (though I was playing as the Julii who pretty much just kills barbarians in northern Europe for the first half of the game). The AI during battles seems to be about the same as the original. Prior to the remaster's release, I was playing the original like crazy.

-Fifth, the customization of the new features. Every change to the core gameplay, including the addition of merchants, can be toggled off. I definitely appreciate the cap on squalor, as it makes public order much easier to manage once you hit around 24000 population in your cities. This is a double edged sword however, as I feel that it could potentially be TOO easy to manage. In my campaign, Medolanium had a population of around 36000 by the end. Public order in the city was 120% and I never even made a hippodrome or arena in the city. In the original that would be literally impossible to manage. I never even had to make a city have more than ""yearly games"" to make them stay happy.

Now let's discuss some of the things the remaster didn't do so well:

-First, the pathfinding. It's still the same as the original's, which wasn't so hot to begin with. Additionally, I've noticed that sometimes in the remaster, a unit standing in a battle line will suddenly decide to take a couple steps forward or backward. I'm not exactly sure what that's all about but I hope it will be patched in the future. It didn't occur in every battle, but still frequently enough to cause concern.

-Second, unit responsiveness. The original Rome: Total War always had a bit of delay when ordering troops, but the remaster is sometimes worse. Most of the time, I had no issues and the battles played exactly how they would in the original. Occasionally however, a unit would decide it didn't want to listen anymore and would just stand there for a couple seconds. This was especially frustrating when trying to make missile units fall back from charging enemy infantry. Also, somewhat related to this, skirmish mode seems to barely function at all. Personally I'm not bothered by this as I don't use it anyway, but I can understand if someone would be.

-Third, the UI. I know, confusing right? While I don't hate the UI as much as some, there are definitely some things that it doesn't accomplish as well as the original. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that all of the unit icons and building icons are so small in the construction/recruitment panel. This doesn't personally bother me, as I know the game so well that I know what the buildings are just from a glance, but it could definitely cause issues for a new player. It did take some time getting to know the new unit cards from a glance, but they're all distinct enough that if you know the original game's unit roster, it's pretty easy to figure out which unit is which. Again though, this could cause issues for new players. Another thing that I feel the original UI does better, is the settlement details page. The breakdown for public order and population growth is much less readable than the original's due to the lack of icons. In the original game, I could open the details and glance at a city and quickly determine what the major issues affecting public order were, just because I knew the icons. In the remaster, everything in the settlement details is in text, making it much harder to get information about public order or population growth from a passing glance.

All in all, if you don't mind the graphical style changes and are looking to play Rome: Total War at a good frame rate, then it's easily worth $15. I will definitely admit however, that I'm a large fan of the original and nostalgia definitely plays a role in my judgement.",1619945859,1619946148,True,4,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

GOOD: 
1) the strategic view on the campaign map with the Public Order overlay makes it easy to see when corners of your empire are getting angry at your leadership; Very helpful

2) when you hit end turn, the game pops up a message about idle armies, navies, agents, settlements, etc. This is very helpful to avoid forgetting about distant armies. You can ignore it if you want, but it's helpful when you need it.

3) After you hit end turn and the game is doing all your queued multi-turn moves, the game allows you to update orders if a path gets blocked

BAD: 
1) There is no way to speed up movement on the campaign map by default. You must always click twice or tap R after telling an army/agent/etc to move. How could they overlook something this basic?

2) Armies look blurry at a distance. Honestly when zoomed out, Medieval 2 has better graphics. Units turn into a semi-unintelligible blob when the camera is far away

3) The construction and recruitment systems are kind of wonky. It would be nice if they were always there when a city is selected, but they are not. There's no need to make me click an extra button when I just want at a glance information.

as for the monitor im using my 58 inch 4k tv and its looks and performs with no lag there are as far as I can tell no technical issues.

perhaps they need reminding that the old Rome total war hud provided very little information compared to remaster for the purpose of running our empires, The remaster has vastly improved on information in regards to my troops, the different states held, Diplomacy is much better with no politics to get in the way, the game provides details in the current state of your rivals and allies are they happy or upset and in trade.

Visuals wise its like comparing the 90's lara croft with triangular boobs against the 2010's lara croft more rounded boobs, original total war rome even if you run your system at ultra settings the troops and horses still looked squarish, remaster  they rounder polygons so they actually look like how Romans or Barbarians suppose to look.

The lighting is better so the shadows are better, the land on the strategic map looks like different kind of land so for example you can tell the difference between land that has been farmed and land that has not, use of colour schemes also helps with the look of new strategic map. 

there significant and noticeable good changes that make the remaster better than the original it looks better, more information in the heads up display, even bowmen have been upgraded so you can see the extent of how far their arrows go so you can strategically place them to maximise damage of enemy units.

Modding the game is with mods I have not tried but looks better game tells you if you have 2 conflicting mods.

It is simply the same Rome: Total War but optimized for the modern PC system. It includes the very [i] special [/i] AI that was present in the original, only you can now experience it at a more stable and smoother frame rate. 

For us returning players, don't set unreasonable expectations and you won't be disappointed. I knew in my gut going in they were never going to touch the AI or make any significant changes to it's behavior. It is more or less the same as before. The pathfinding in settlements is a bit wonky and will require a little more micro to position your troops where you want. They added in some welcome QOL improvements on the strategy layer that will make managing your empire a little easier: moving retinues through a menu, agents and armies being able to move again if interrupted during the end turn sequence, diplomats being able to enter and reenter negotiations with more than one faction in a single turn.

I dislike the new UI as it is a bit too mobile for me. They should have kept the old one and added in the new stuff through that, or at least give the option keep the classic one. I also do not like how the settlement and army ledgers no longer display raw numbers, but instead show icons like a coin pouch or a color coded Greek play mask, which you then have to hover your cursor over to display how much money a city is making, or what the public order percentage is. Keybinds are also currently not re-bindable despite the game stating you can. Did none of your QA guys even test it out?

Despite the imperfections, it is a decent remaster. It works as advertised and as I expected, and it is not the dumpster fire many of the negative reviews (with less than 1 hour of playtime) would lead you to believe.

Pros and Cons to the changes to the game.  There's a lot of up front WOW factor here that's a huge plus coming from the original game.  Updated graphics, adjustments in gameplay, updated audio, etc. catches the eye quickly, but a quick run through the initial campaign brings up a couple of issues with the remastered version right out the gate:

1.  Diplomatic dialogue:  The other Roman factions can easily be siphoned of their denarii by whichever Roman faction you choose to play as, by offering to attack factions for a price.  You can easily run the gauntlet of factions, even the ones none of the others (including you) have met yet, allowing you to quickly build up a nice reserve of coin early on to funnel your war machine.  This is potentially game breaking, especially since none of the other factions in the game offer anything similar for a start.

2.  Graphics Bug in Greece:  This was something less common in the original title, but panning over Greece with the camera is prone to cause performance issues at any moment in the campaign, more so than in any of the other regions.  I don't know whether it's due to the sheer amount of icons and terrain changes being packed into the region, poor coding, etc. but it's certainly problematic when you're using a machine that can easily handle the game.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm still picking through to see if anything else was missed from the original title, though it's certainly nice to see the good changes added to Total War: ROME REMASTERED.  I'm happy they added the merchants from Total War:  Medieval II, I do wish naval units could be allowed to retreat though, when engaged after your turn has ended.

1) Enemy Macedon attacked from 2 sides, one ram on one side and 5 rams on the other side. 

2) The side with 1 ram destroyed my gate 

3) The thousands of troops on the OTHER SIDE of my city, still with 5 rams smashing my walls, all decided to just run around the outside of my city to go to the other side, just because my gates on that side were broken. It seems the AI simply notices that there's now one entrance to my base and makes every troop just haul ass towards it no matter how stupid it is

4) When the remaining units that were piloting the other rams finally smashed down the remaining walls of my city, all the enemies still tried to squish themselves into the exact same entrance even though there was now 6 different spots to enter my base 

5) After the thousands of troops that were all trying to squish into one entrance finally got through, each unit was so scrambled and spread apart that they never actually attacked my defenders as a cohesive unit - the 240 soldiers in a unit of their pikeman just kinda threw themselves at me a few at a time, never in a proper formation, so despite me being outnumbered 2:1 I just demolished their entire army with like 2 units 

6) Since I was destroying the attackers with barely any effort and they were all mostly running away, we had thousands of troops trying to flee my city, and thousands trying to enter my city ,all through the same damn entrance. I wish I took a video because there was literally 3,000 soldiers equally trying to enter and escape my city through one entrance. Not only that but the attacking troops didnt bother to wait until their entire unit got through before attacking as a unit, instead they all ran around in circles or ran at me like 3 soldiers at a time. 

7) Sometimes my cavalry would run toward the enemy when I was clicking the opposite direction 

I havent yet played a game with the smaller unit sizes so I dont know if these horrible AI problems are due to the sheer number of soldiers or what but it really ruins the game, I was expecting to lose my city but wanted to watch an epic battle with my troops fighjting till the end, instead I killed over 2,000 of their 4,000 soldiers and only lost 100 because of how badly the enemy was at actually attacking me. I'm not expecting some supercomputer level strategy but this is zero improvement over the original game. There's plenty of mods for the first game that improve AI so it should be more than possible for the actual developers of the game to produce something better than this.

I'm past the point of being able to refund this, and it isn't worse than the original rome game, so I guess i'll wait for the community to fix the problem and download the mod.

The argument can certainly be made that more of the bugs and problems could have been ironed out as part of the QoL changes, but honestly? I (and presumably many others) didn't expect any of that. I was just here for a remastered version of R:TW and I got it. I completely understand this remaster not 'changing/fixing' enough being a dealbreaker for others, but for some of us, this was enough.

Yes, its simple compared to modern total wars. Yes, it has questionable path finding (especially in towns ugh), but this was the first total war for many of us.

885970,91263273,76561198016880157,0,64,952,0,691,1649390892,"First off, before I get to the review, let me state a condition to my recommendation: that you have played the original Rome: Total War and that you cannot get it working on your system or no longer have a copy of the original. Because whilst the remaster includes improvements, it also retains a lot of issues the original has, and does not stand up as a modern game. However, as a remastered version of the original Rome, it stands up, thus I'm giving it a thumbs up.

I won't go into a lot of detail about reviewing the original Rome and the concepts carried forward. Thus I'll get straight to what this remaster does and does not do right:

The main draws of the remaster are the graphics improvements and the compatibility with modern systems. Whilst I personally had no issues with the steam version of the original Rome, the game chugged on larger battles and hated alt-tabbing. I've had no compatibility-based issues with the remaster. And indeed although the system requirements are higher (especially with the enhanced graphics pack), I haven't experienced any system-related crashes. That isn't to say the game runs flawlessly. Loading times are disappointing for HDD users and I've had the game hang up multiple times on end turn.

Though the graphics are overall an improvement, the new UI leaves much to be desired. It's confusing and ugly and is not as useful at a glance. Whilst it can fit more information onto a single screen, even after memorising where everything is, the details take longer to absorb. The unit cards in battle for instance. The icons for when units are moving or not are a lot harder to immediately work out. There are elements of the UI that also look straight out of a mobile game. And there are some aspects such as post-battle stats that have not been 'improved', when that's one part of the old UI that really needs touching up compared to newer Total War games.

Pretty much all factions in the game are now playable without having to edit text files (or in the case of some Barbarian Invasion factions, outright mod them), which is great, as it means missing assets in certain factions are now present and factions like the Romano-British are now outright playable when they weren't before.

So what DOESN'T the remaster do? Well there are plenty of features of the old Rome in dire need of touching up that have not been improved. Pathfinding is the major one. There do seem to be some changes, but whilst there are some places where it does feel better, it feels more broken in others. What is surprising is that the devs included an experimental 'extreme' unit size setting, when the AI barely functions with ultra, especially in siege battles (I mean seriously, ultra size sieges make siege towers worse than ladders due to the slow trickle of soldiers climbing them at a slow speed, meaning units get stuck in them forever... I can't imagine what that would be like with even larger unit sizes). Units still derp around and I don't know if I'm remembering wrong or not, but seem to 'checkpoint' more. For instance, a unit climbing off a wall will wait until all soldiers have gotten off the wall before moving anywhere else, which can be infuriating when said unit is stuck strung across the wall due to having climbed a siege tower to get up there in the first place.

The game also does not add an option (as far as I can see) to disable AI campaign victories. Why does it matter? Well because short campaigns are only really winnable either by playing certain easy factions or rushing to conquer, otherwise a faction like Egypt will beat you to it due to having an insanely easy start and pretty simple victory conditions. Want to take your time and build up super powerful armies before steamrolling your foes? Tough. Send out the fodder! If you want a short Roman campaign that lasts past the reforms... well you're going to have to be lucky. My last campaign, Egypt won literally on the same turn the reforms happened.

So... in all, the remaster fixes up some of the outdated or incompatible feature of Rome, but not all. In some cases it makes things worse, but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. So a tentative recommendation with conditions is all it really deserves.",1619920085,1619920085,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

The game itself is the RTW we loved with some improvements to campaign AI (like not making a bunch of small armies).  I have found myself be attacked by multiple large armies and have to genuinely think about my movements on the map.

I can't speak for everyone about the performance - Some are complaining of FPS drops. 
I have had one FPS drop on the campaign map, fixed it by going back to the main menu and loading in again. Other than that - and I cannot stress this enough - the game runs SMOOTH AS BUTTER.
The original game cannot keep up with modern systems. The campaign map would lag when you moved it, the battles would lag if it had more than three people on the battlefield at the same time. This? LOCKED 144 FPS, ULTRA SETTINGS. NO COMPROMISES.

This is a remaster. Not a remake. People who enjoyed the original game will come back to all of the strengths the series had at this point in time - Proper unit collision, simplicity in the campaign, etc. If you come here expecting it to be an entirely new game, just based on Rome 1, you will not find it here. I am perplexed by people giving this a negative review expecting an entirely new game.

I want to make it clear that this game NOT being a remake is why it is so valuable to me. I just want to play Rome Total War, because it is one of the best. I do not want to play it in the new engine. I can take or leave the graphics improvements, the performance and stability improvements are enough.

If you want to play Rome again, and already have the original in your library for a 50% off discount, then get this. Modding scene is going to be crazy, the game itself is pristine, and I have absolutely enjoyed my time with it.

My one major complaint is for Feral to take note of, however it isn't abysmal: The UI changes on the campaign specifically should be a toggle, like the rest of the settings. I don't personally think the UI is worse than the original game (hey, at least it scales with 16:9 and 21:9 aspect ratios now!) but it should still be a toggle for those who are not used to it.



Edit: The game is, at a maximum, over 40GB in size. I believe you are able to make this smaller by opting out of the enhanced graphics pack. At the initial download/install, the game will ask for 40GB of space, however if you don't use the graphics pack it won't take up that much.

- The UI is a clunky mess. The original was just fine in this area, I don't know what sparked the complete rewrite. They've buried lots of options under extra clicks that the game might as well ship with a shovel for digging.

- The palette for the world map is too vibrant in parts, again the original had it just fine. If anything, make the map grittier not prettier - or at least more realistic.

- Game crashed on my second battle, just towards the end when victory was assured (of course!). Since then, seems to be running smoothly but it's made me leary of battles...can the Julii simply talk its way to victory??

- Main menu options are buried so prepared to do some more digging to find things, even the most basic of things.

- The cartoony approach to cutscenes and the intro do this series an injustice. They just look plain bad and should never have been a part of the remaster. Again, the original did this better.

Do NOT buy until it reaches deep discount levels - I got it at the 50% OFF promo. In the end, you're simply better off playing the original. Haven't bought a CA game since 2013 until this - glad I got it for half off. But CA, you're back on my hit list.

Did I find the new UI clunky and annoying as I notice many people have?
 Yes, but I also found that I got well used to it after a couple of hours to the point of not even noticing it and if you yourself find it intolerable then there is always the option to reduce it in the settings.

Does it have the same issues that the original game did?
The ai is just as inept and path finding just as frustrating as it was in the original and just about every other total war game I've ever played. No changes have been made to the factions or their rosters so the game is also just as unbalanced and rome centric as the original. Though this second point I expect (and hope) will be corrected by mods which thankfully have been made much easier thanks to the workshop.

I like the new voice acting (except when Alexander calls himself the heir of Alexander just because he is greek).
There are plenty of UI improvements.
The new merchant agent is interesting.
Unlike modern Total War games, there does not appear to be a general influence radius, so go play Alexander and attack with your general.

Cons:
The pathing is terrible.
Unlike modern Total War games, you have to manually replenish troops.
Unlike modern Total War games, naval battles are automatic and you cannot retreat.

Like, this game is not worth 30 dollars. It's definitely worth 15 as I was able to get like 25 hours in the first 2 days and it was really fun. If you can get it for 50% off or 75% off, it's definitely a steal. Additionally, you get the original game too if you don't have the original game. There are also quite a few rebalancing things, like the fact that you can't solo armies with three generals bodyguards anymore. Cavalry is noticeably less powerful and doesn't charge as much as it did in original. Thankfully, they didn't change morale that much and you can still have *huge* mass routs if you time it nicely. The battles still feel really 'Rome-y' instead of newer TW games. Finally, it's going to be more moddable than original RTW as Feral is probably going to increase the faction cap even more than 31, which is pretty cool. Also, I hear that people have frequent FPS problems, but I have a good computer, so it isn't that noticeable except for the first time you start the game, then the loading takes a really long time. It loads as fast as old RTW, so that's awesome as you'll never autoresolve. 

Now, the biggest problem with this remaster is the UI and it looks really bad. One of the awesome things about R1/M2 was that you could see everything on the city finance screen. You could see population growth, how much money you could make, what the public order is projected to be, etc. Like, I'd even say that it's better than the newer TW's UI because you can't see how much money you're going to make once your buildings are done in 3K. They completely made it so that instead of one screen, it's three. Battle UI is fine though, so that's okay. Another thing that's really stupid was making the AI even *more* aggressive against the player than original RTW. A good example of this is playing as Macedon where you can easily take out the Brutii in five turns because they send their starting forces to Corinth instead of Appollonia and then you can easily take that small army out if you sign an alliance with the Greek City States, then just invade the Italian Peninsula. The AI is hellbent on taking you out and it often sacrifices its own cities to do that. You'll be able (if you're a good general at least), catch them near their cities and then force a draw out. At least in original RTW, while the AI was hellbent on taking you out, they definitely rushed the Rebel settlements first instead of picking a fight with another faction.  They also didn't improve the AI at all in battles and the pathfinding seems a bit worse. 

In other words, this is the first time I agree with an IGN review. It's a 7/10 for me and it's well-worth 15 dollars. If they're able to make it more moddable (make the AI moddable especially and increase the faction cap above M2's), make a toggle for the older UI, and improve the pathfinding (read, extreme unit sizes work in cities and are really good), then that would make it a 10/10.

I can't tell how many hundreds of hours I have on Shogun 1, Medieval 1 and 2 and Rome 1. I still own the physical games.
This game is truly a remaster. You can play it in modern computers with modern resolutions and even improved graphics. The game feels like home if you liked Rome 1. It has some changes you can opt-out to, but I honestly think they improve the game. Except the UI (and we can't opt out of it for now).

MY opinion about the controversies you will read about it:

Windows 7. I doubt Feral can have windows7 computers around for technical and security reasons (and probably legal). If you hate windows10 that much (no wonder), come to the dark side and use GNU/Linux. The game works great.

UI: As I said, I don't like it either. I don't hate it, but I liked the old one more. I hope they change it. 

AI: Yes... well... it's still meh. Some people say it has improved some. They're probably right. Not sure yet, I have played only 5 hours. Seems to me the AI in campaign has improved (I was defeating the Gauls and they offered me money for a ceasefire). But for sure the improvement is minor. I hope Feral does something about it. Or modders, but they shouldn't rely on them to do their job.

Price: I think is more than fair. They haven't just created a launcher for modern OS, they've done new graphics and mechanics and voice acting and videos... that has to be paid. It's even less if you already owned the original. If not, you get the original ones too.

Most expected loads of ""improvements"", where the goal was simply to make the game playable natively on newer system.
Now you can play RTW for the rest of Windows 10's life (which should be eternal according to MS).
It's 15-30€, for 3 legendary games. 
For first timers it's a great fun game, not the most challenging but a good bit of fun.
Anyone with basic knowledge of strategy will overcome the game. But I think it also makes irrelevant cheesing tactics that so many streamers/players have to resort to to beat newer Total War games in the hardest difficulty, because they think it proves something. Games are games.
If you want a whole new, serious experience with more challenging and balanced aspects, go buy 3 Kingdoms or so.

Personally I still remember the day I bought RTW 15 years ago. I had really great memories, but in recent years I was sad it wouldn't run well on newer PCs. It took a lot to make it work, and even with mods it struggled. 

OK, on to the review :

In terms of performance :
The game works very well, I average 110 FPS with a current generation card and a 4 years old CPU. You can run it in Windowed Borderless and chill watching stuff on your second screen, the pinnacle of RTW experience!
I agree it is too heavy, 67GB with HD textures instead of 9GB for the Gold edition. Clearly missing some optimization

UI :
The UI is a change, took some adapting, some things like the lack of success rate on agents' actions directly in the map preview sucks I'll admit. 
But after 18 hours I'm 100% accustomed to it and it works well. The one tiresome thing for me is that Escape does not always exit an UI, some things like army merges lack a ""CONFIRM"" button instead of clicking an annoyingly small button.
Mixed opinion on the UI. If you recruit in half the provinces at  the same time, opening the recruitment message is laggy. 

AI :
The AI hasn't changed much. It's more aggressive, yes, but it's still very easy to cheese, and to get a challenging experience you'll probably have to cheat to give the AI extra resources. Rome is still busted OP.
Diplomacy is still messy, it feels like every action you take will deteriorate your reputation forever. Allies still backstab you all the time for no reason, diplomats still interact with your cities / armies only to do nothing. 
But there are no ""regressions"" compared to the base game. You get what's expected.

Graphics :
The map looks pretty, textures are smooth and pretty. Feels well polished, the battles look great.
You can choose the map's vibrance if you prefer more tame colors.

In the end, for the price of 6 subs to hot tub streams or 3 MOBA skins, it's a great value.",1619903271,1619903271,True,0,0,0.491573035717010498,0,True,False,False

I would recommend buying this game as it is clearly the superior to the original with both its AI and graphics, but that's about it to be honest. You cannot even buy the original on its own now and are forced to buy the remaster - a really sneaky and deceptive move by CA (and/or SEGA). 

About everything else is either exactly the same or inferior to the original. A few examples of the game being inferior is with its cutscenes, intros and UI. The cutscenes and intro were plugged and advertised as ""brand new content"" but in reality they were crap random battles spliced together that nobody cared about. Why not just do a remake of the original intro of the huge siege on Rome with updated graphics? This clearly would've been far better than what was given to us and everyone would've been happy with the outcome. 

The game has clearly oversold some things as well, one example of this being with the ""new playable"" factions. Factions like the Romano-British can certainly be called ""new playable"" as to get this working in the base game required quite a bit of editing and messing around. However factions such as Numidia can certainly not be called new. To unlock this faction in the base game required a simple edit of a text file that anyone could do, it certainly shouldn't have added to this games cost and should not have been highlighted as a new game feature by any means. They have updated the AI and pathfinding and while THIS IS better than the original by all stretches it is by no means ""fixed"". You will still struggle with pathfinding on larger unit sizes and the AI still doesn't act appropriately in certain situations.

I keep seeing the argument made ""this is a remaster, not a remake"", and so what? Just because it is a remaster does not mean they can charge a £25 price tag for updated graphics and AI and just get away with it. The best example I can give in this instance is Age of Empires 2. The definitive edition that was released a year ago updated all aspects of the game like graphics, UI, AI and much more while keeping the base gameplay the exact same to original. I fully understand that this was a DEFINITIVE edition and not a remaster, but for a definitive edition that costs half the price and contains so much more it's hard to feel like I've not been ripped off with what Feral/CA/SEGA have given us.

With all this said however, I am very sure the complaints that I have with the game like UI, AI etc will be sorted by mods in the very near future as modding in the game has been made very accessible from what I've been told. With this is mind, I would say that IT IS worth the half price tag of £12.50 but i would not buy this game for the full price as it's clearly a shameless, half finished cash grab.",1619900210,1619900210,False,4,0,0.556261122226715088,3,True,False,False
